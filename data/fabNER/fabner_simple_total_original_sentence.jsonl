Revealed the location-specific flow patterns and quantified the speeds of various types of flow . 
Reconstructed three-dimensional flow pattern under both conduction-mode melting and depression-mode melting . 
Experimentally analyzed the prevailing physical processes at different locations in the melt pool . 
Melt flow plays a critical role in laser metal additive manufacturing , yet the melt flow behavior within the melt pool has never been explicitly presented . 
Here , we report in-situ characterization of melt-flow dynamics in every location of the entire melt pool in laser metal additive manufacturing by populous and uniformly dispersed micro-tracers through in-situ high-resolution synchrotron x-ray imaging . 
The location-specific flow patterns in different regions of the melt pool are revealed and quantified under both conduction-mode and depression-mode melting . 
The physical processes at different locations in the melt pool are identified . 
The full-field melt-flow mapping approach reported here opens the way to study the detailed melt-flow dynamics under real additive manufacturing conditions . 
The results obtained provide crucial insights into laser additive manufacturing processes and are critical for developing reliable high-fidelity computational models . 
High resolution X-ray tomography was used to evaluate the efficiency of Hot Isostatic Pressing . 
Full consolidation of large internal cavities filled with unmelted powder was demonstrated . 
Design of such cavities with unmelted powder could improve production rates by eliminating the need for some fraction of hatch melting in the interior of additively-manufactured structures . 
HIP is highly effective at closing most typical porosity distributions . 
Exceptions are highly interconnected pores and pores near the surface . 
Hot isostatic pressing ( HIP ) of additively manufactured metals is a widely adopted and effective method to improve the density and microstructure homogeneity within geometrically-complex metal structures fabricated with laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) . 
The role of pores in the fatigue performance of additively manufactured metal parts is increasingly being recognized as a critical factor and HIP post-processing is now heralded as a method to eliminate pores , especially for high-criticality applications such as in the aerospace industry . 
Despite the widely reported positive influence on fatigue performance and high efficiency of pore closure , examples have been reported in which pores have not been entirely closed or have subsequently re-opened upon heat treatment . 
A variety of porosity distributions and types of pores may be present in parts produced by LBPF and the effectiveness of pore closure may differ depending on these pore characteristics . 
In this work , X-ray tomography was employed to provide insights into pore closure efficiency by HIP for an intentional and artificially-induced cavity as well as for a range of typical process-induced pores ( lack of fusion , keyhole , contour pores , etc . ) 
in coupon samples of Ti6Al4V . 
The same samples were imaged non-destructively before and after HIP and aligned carefully for side-by-side viewing . 
High pore closure efficiency is demonstrated for all types of cavities and pores investigated , but near-surface pores of all types are shown to be problematic to varying degrees , in some cases perforating the superficial surface and creating new external notches . 
Subsequent heat treatments ( annealing after HIP ) in some cases resulted in internal pore reopening for previously closed internal pores as well as a new “ blistering ” effect observed for some near-surface pores , which the authors believe is reported for the first time . 
Implications of these results for quality control and HIP processing of LPBF parts are discussed . 
Finally , the utility of using HIP to consolidate intentionally-unmelted powder in order to improve production rates of powder bed fusion has great potential and is preliminarily demonstrated . 
Direct Energy Deposition ( DED ) systems are currently used to repair and maintain existing parts in the aerospace and automotive industries . 
This paper discusses an effort to scale up the DED technique in order to Additively Manufacture ( AM ) molds and dies used in the composite manufacturing industry . 
The US molds and dies market has been in a rapid decline over the last decade due to outsourcing to non-US entities . 
Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( ORNL ) , Wolf Robotics and Lincoln Electric have developed a Metal Big Area Additive Manufacturing ( MBAAM ) system that uses a high deposition rate and a low-cost wire feedstock material . 
In this work we used the MBAAM system with a mild steel wire , ER70S-6 , to fabricate a compression molding mold for composite structures used in automotive and mass-transit applications . 
In addition , the mechanical properties of the AM structure were investigated , and it was found that the MBAAM process delivers parts with high planar isotropic behavior . 
The paper investigates the microstructure and grain of the printed articles to confirm the roots of the observed planar isotropic properties . 
The manufactured AM mold was used to fabricate 50 composite parts with no observed mold deformations . 
Wire feed metal additive manufacturing offers advantages , such as large build volumes and high build rates , over powder bed and blown powder techniques , but it has its own disadvantages , i.e. 
, lower feature resolution and bead morphology control issues . 
A new wire feed metal additive manufacturing process called Metal Big Area Additive Manufacturing ( mBAAM ) uses a Gas Metal Arc Weld system on an articulated robot arm to increase build volume and deposition rate in comparison to powder bed techniques . 
The high deposition rate implies a low-resolution process ; therefore , parts designed for mBAAM must incorporate the use of machining to achieve certain features . 
This paper presents an introduction to how design rules , such as overhang constraint , large weld bead thickness , and support structure , for mBAAM interact in the context of an excavator arm case study , which was designed using topology optimization . 
Interactive database for mechanical properties of metal lattice structures . 
Lattice Unit-cell Characterization Interface for Engineering compiles 69 sources . 
Lattice structure data compiled from analytical , experimental , and finite element . 
Data compilation includes nearly 1650 experimental and finite element data points . 
Lattice data incorporates 18 different common unit cell topologies . 
With the ever-increasing resolution of metal additive manufacturing processes , the ability to design and fabricate cellular or lattice structures is readily improving . 
While there are few limits to the variety of unit cell topologies that can feasibly be manufactured , there is little known about the effect that the underlying unit cell topology has on lattice structure mechanical performance . 
Increased knowledge of lattice structure performance based on the unit cell topology can aid in appropriate unit cell selection to achieve desired lattice structure mechanical properties . 
The objective in this work is to compile metal additively manufactured lattice structure characterization data found in the literature into Ashby-style plots that can be used to differentiate unit cell topologies and guide unit cell selection . 
Data gathered from literature encompasses over 69 papers describing 18 different unit cell topologies . 
Data on mechanical properties such as the effective modulus , Poisson ’ s ratio , yield strength , buckling strength , and plateau strength , of lattice structures from analytical models based on mathematical derivations , finite element analysis , and experimental characterization was gathered and synthesized . 
In total , nearly 1,650 data points for experimental and finite element analysis were compiled along with a variety of analytical models for 18 different unit cell topologies . 
The process of gathering the data from the literature along with the assumptions used to compile the data are discussed . 
A graphical user interface and database were developed that allows for comparison of different lattice structure mechanical properties based on their unit cell topology . 
The Lattice Unit-cell Characterization Interface for Engineers ( LUCIE ) provides a simple format to guide engineers , scientists , and others towards understanding the relationships of the unit cell topology and the lattice structure mechanical properties , with the intent of guiding appropriate unit cell selection . 
Three cases studies are shown for using LUCIE to differentiate unit cell topologies for improved understanding of experimental and simulation-based results ( Case Study 1 ) , to identify unit cell topology options for reducing weight while maintaining yield stress or increasing yield stress without reducing weight ( Case Study 2 ) , and for quickly narrowing multiple options to an appropriate unit cell topology ( Case Study 3 ) . 
Drop-on-demand jetting of metals offers a fully digital manufacturing approach to surpass the limitations of the current generation powder-based additive manufacturing technologies . 
However , research on this topic has been restricted mainly to near-net shaping of relatively low melting temperature metals . 
Here it is proposed a novel approach to jet molten metals at high-temperatures ( > 1000 °C ) to enable the direct digital additive fabrication of micro- to macro-scale objects . 
The technique used in our research – “ MetalJet ” - is discussed by studying the ejection and the deposition of two example metals , tin and silver . 
The applicability of this new technology to additive manufacturing is evaluated through the study of the interface formed between the droplets and the substrate , the inter-droplets bonding , the microstructure and the geometrical fidelity of the printed objects . 
The research shows that the integrity of the samples ( in terms of density as well as metallurgy ) varies dramatically in the two investigated materials due to the different conditions that are required to melt the interface of the stacked droplets . 
Nevertheless the research shows that by a careful choice of the jetting strategy and sintering treatments 3D structures of various complexity can be formed . 
This research paves the way towards the next generation metal additive manufacturing where various printing resolutions and multi-material capabilities could be used to obtain functional components for applications in printed electronics , medicine and the automotive sectors . 
Metal additive manufacturing ( AM ) as an emerging manufacturing technique has been gradually accepted to manufacture end-use components . 
However , one of the most critical issues preventing its broad applications is build failure resulting from residual stress accumulation in manufacturing process . 
The goal of this work is to investigate the feasibility of using topology optimization to design support structure to mitigate residual stress induced build failure . 
To make topology optimization computationally tractable , the inherent strain method is employed to perform fast prediction of residual stress in an AM build . 
Graded lattice structure optimization is utilized to design the support structure due to the open-celled and self-supporting nature of periodic lattice structure . 
The objective for the optimization is to minimize the mass of sacrificial support structure under stress constraint . 
By limiting the maximum stress under the yield strength , cracking resulting from residual stress can be prevented . 
To show the feasibility of the proposed method , the support structure of a double-cantilever beam and a hip implant is designed , respectively . 
The support structure after optimization can achieve a weight reduction of approximately 60 % . 
The components with optimized support structures no longer suffer from stress-induced cracking after the designs are realized by AM , which proves the effectiveness of the proposed method . 
Additive friction stir deposition ( AFSD ) is an emerging solid-state metal additive manufacturing technology renowned for strong interface adhesion and isotropic mechanical properties . 
This is postulated to result from the material flow phenomena near the interface , but experimental corroboration has remained absent . 
Here , we seek to understand the interface formed in AFSD via morphological and microstructural investigation , wherein the non-planar interfacial morphology is characterized on the track-scale ( centimeter scale ) using X-ray computed tomography and the material deformation history is explored by microstructure mapping at the interfacial regions . 
X-ray computed tomography reveals unique 3D features at the interface with significant macroscopic material mixing . 
In the out-of-plane direction , the deposited material inserts below the initial substrate surface in the feed-rod zone , while the substrate surface surges upwards in the tool protrusion-affected zone . 
Complex 3D structures like fins and serrations form on the advancing side , leading to structural interlocking ; on the retreating side , the interface manifests as a smooth sloped surface . 
Microstructure mapping reveals a uniform thermomechanical history for the deposited material , which develops a homogeneous , almost fully recrystallized microstructure . 
The substrate surface develops partially recrystallized microstructures that are location-dependent ; more intra-granular orientation gradients are found in the regions further away from the centerline of the deposition track . 
From these observations , we discuss the mechanisms for interfacial material flow and interface morphology formation during AFSD . 
Embedded electronics and sensors are becoming increasingly important for the development of Industry 4.0 . 
For small components , space constraints lead to full 3D integration requirements that are only achievable through Additive Manufacturing . 
Manufacturing metal components usually require high temperatures incompatible with electronics but Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing ( UAM ) can produce components with mechanical properties close to bulk , but with the integration of internal embedded electronics , sensors or optics . 
This paper describes a novel manufacturing route for embedding electronics with 3D via connectors in an aluminium matrix . 
Metal foils with printed conductors and insulators were prepared separately from the UAM process thereby separating the electronics preparation from the part consolidation . 
A dual material polymer layer exhibited the best electrically insulating properties , while providing mechanical protection of printed conductive tracks stable up to 100 °C . 
General design and UAM process recommendations are given for 3D embedded electronics in a metal matrix . 
Functionally graded metals fabricated using high-temperature additive manufacturing can form intermetallics that fracture during printing due to thermal stresses generated by the heat source . 
To address this problem , we introduce a new class of non-equilibrium phase diagrams , termed Scheil Ternary Projection ( STeP ) diagrams , for designing optimal composition gradients that avoid brittle phases . 
Using the Fe-Cr-Al ternary as a model system , we compare the phase fields in equilibrium and STeP diagrams to show that intermetallic phase fields are dramatically expanded under the rapid solidification conditions in melt-based additive manufacturing , an important effect that must be accounted for when designing composition gradients . 
We present the results of 3D modeling of the laser and electron beam powder bed fusion process at the mesoscale with an in-house developed advanced multiphysical numerical tool . 
The hydrodynamics and thermal conductivity core of the tool is based on the lattice Boltzmann method . 
The numerical tool takes into account the random distributions of powder particles by size in a layer and the propagation of the laser ( electron beam ) with a full ray tracing ( Monte Carlo ) model that includes multiple reflections , phase transitions , thermal conductivity , and detailed liquid dynamics of the molten metal , influenced by evaporation of the metal and the recoil pressure . 
We numerically demonstrate a strong dependence of the net energy absorption of the incoming heat source beam by the powder bed and melt pool on the beam power . 
We show the ability of our model to predict the measurable properties of a single track on a bare substrate as well as on a powder layer . 
We obtain good agreement with experimental data for the depth , width and shape of a track for a number of materials and a wide range of energy source parameters . 
We further apply our model to the simulation of the entire layer formation and demonstrate the strong dependence of the resulting layer morphology on the hatch spacing . 
The presented model could be very helpful for optimizing the additive process without carrying out a large number of experiments in a common trial-and-error method , developing process parameters for new materials , and assessing novel modalities of powder bed fusion additive manufacturing . 
The particle size and shape distributions of metal powders used in additive manufacturing powder bed fusion processes are of technological importance for the final built product . 
Current three-dimensional ( 3D ) measurements of these distributions assume a spherical shape , while techniques that measure both size and shape are always two-dimensional ( 2D ) measurements of particle projections . 
This paper describes a set of techniques using X-ray computed tomography , combined with various mathematical algorithms , to measure the 3D size , shape , and internal porosity of individual particles . 
Calibrated by a limited amount of visual examination of 3D images of individual particles , these techniques can classify powder particles as single near-spherical ( SnS ) particles , and non-spherical ( NS ) particles , which consist of either single highly non-spherical particles or multi-particles , where two or more smaller particles have been joined together . 
From this 3D data , other algorithms can generate 2D particle size and shape information to compare with the results of 2D measurement techniques . 
These techniques are applied to two metal powders composed of a specific alloy of titanium with aluminum and vanadium , denoted as Ti64 , which is in common use as a powder for selective laser or electron beam melting powder bed additive manufacturing . 
One powder was made with a gas-atomization process , the other with a plasma-atomization process , both have been recycled , and both pass the specifications for additive manufacturing use . 
The powders differ in the fraction of NS particles and porous particles , in their size and shape distributions , and in average shape and size statistics . 
The SnS/NS classification enables one to show how these classes contribute to the overall particle size distributions , even for a single powder type , and is useful for comparing different sources of powder as well as studying how the size/shape distributions of a powder might change over multiple recycling events . 
Electrochemical microstructuring enables the production of polymer-metal hybrids by means of Material Extrusion without the need of coatings . 
The contact temperature between the metal sheet and the deposited polymer significantly influences the resulting component behavior . 
A consolidation roll improves the filling of microstructures for low contact temperatures . 
The development towards higher individualization and functional density pushes the need towards a flexible production of multi-material and lightweight components . 
In this paper , extrusion based additive manufacturing was used to produce polymer-metal hybrids with polypropylene and aluminum alloy . 
For this purpose , a screw-driven extruder on a six-axis robot was used . 
Due to the adhesion incompatibility of polypropylene and untreated metals , the surface of the aluminum sheets was electrochemically micro-structured . 
The investigations show that this enables a mechanically stressable joint through the filling of the surface microstructures with polymer . 
Investigations on lap shear joints reveal a distinct influence of the contact temperature between the polymer and metal onto the lap shear strength . 
A sufficient contact temperature is required for filling surface microstructures . 
Thus , increased metal and extrusion temperatures favor higher strengths . 
Furthermore , the use of a consolidation roll shows beneficial influences in lower temperature ranges due to the application of higher pressures during the polymer strand deposition . 
A virtual binocular vision sensor is developed to monitor molten pool width . 
A closed-loop controller is designed for molten pool width control . 
Comparison tests between open and closed-loop control are carried out . 
Gas metal arc ( GMA ) additive manufacturing ( AM ) is one of the significant wire and arc AM processes with the ability to produce large-scale metal parts in a layer by layer fashion . 
Despite this fact , techniques to realize process sensing and geometry control have not been perfectly developed . 
This study aims at molten pool width control in GMA AM using a passive vision sensing technique . 
A virtual binocular vision sensing system consisting of a biprism and a camera is designed to monitor the molten pool geometry . 
The molten pool width in a captured image pair is extracted by a series of procedures , such as sensor calibration , image pair rectification , disparity calculation , and width reconstruction . 
A verification test is conducted and reveals that the detection error of the sensing system is less than 3 % . 
To keep consistent layer width in each layer , the deviation of the molten pool width is compensated by designing a fuzzy intelligent controller to adjust the arc current in real time . 
The effectiveness of the controller is evaluated via the deposition of thin-walled parts . 
The results indicate that the consistency of the molten pool width in GMA AM can be improved when employing the fuzzy controller . 
Porosity in additively manufactured metals can reduce material strength and is generally undesirable . 
Although studies have shown relationships between process parameters and porosity , monitoring strategies for defect detection and pore formation are still needed . 
In this paper , instantaneous anomalous conditions are detected in-situ via pyrometry during laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing and correlated with voids observed using post-build micro-computed tomography . 
Large two-color pyrometry data sets were used to estimate instantaneous temperatures , melt pool orientations and aspect ratios . 
Machine learning algorithms were then applied to processed pyrometry data to detect outlier images and conditions . 
It is shown that melt pool outliers are good predictors of voids observed post-build . 
With this approach , real time process monitoring can be incorporated into systems to detect defect and void formation . 
Alternatively , using the methodology presented here , pyrometry data can be post processed for porosity assessment . 
This paper proposes an additive manufacturing method that combines fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) 3D printing and an electroforming technology to fabricate multi-material structures composed of resin and metal . 
In this method , an FFF 3D printer prints a resin mold that functions as a structural unit in a multi-material structure and as a sacrificial plastic mold for the addition of the metal material . 
This sacrificial mold is eventually removed . 
Electroforming the interior of a printed resin mold enables the fabrication of multi-material structures using resin and metal materials . 
The fabrication conditions for multi-material structures when using the proposed method were investigated and the surfaces of the resulting structures were evaluated . 
The fabrication conditions for the specified thickness per process and the total thicknesses from all the processes were determined . 
Furthermore , our results indicated that the shape of the side of the metal portion depended on the forming precision of the FFF 3D printer . 
We present an example of the fabrication of a gear shape from resin and metal . 
X-ray CT and image analysis enable full surface characterization of LPBF channels . 
Novel methodology enables roughness profile extraction from 3D deviation data . 
360° roughness characterization enables predictive models for LPBF channels . 
The increasingly complex shapes and geometries being produced using additive manufacturing necessitate new characterization techniques that can address the corresponding challenges . 
Standard techniques for roughness and texture measurements are inept at characterizing the internal surfaces in freeform geometries . 
Hence , this work presents a new methodology for extracting and quantitatively characterizing the roughness on internal surfaces . 
The methodology links X-ray CT with complete roughness characterization of channels manufactured by laser powder bed fusion through a novel image analysis approach of X-ray CT data . 
Global and local orientation parameters are defined to enable a full 360° description of the roughness inside additively manufactured channels . 
X-ray CT data is analyzed to generate 3D deviation data – based on which multiple local roughness profiles are extracted and analyzed in accordance with the ISO 4287:1997 standard . 
To demonstrate the proposed methodology , seven circular 17-4 PH stainless steel channels produced at different inclinations and with a diameter of 2 mm are investigated as a case study . 
Qualitative and quantitative characterization of the roughness is obtained through the use of the proposed methodology . 
A strong dependence of the local roughness on the corresponding α and β orientations is found . 
A simple regression model is subsequently extracted from the calculated roughness values and allows prediction of Ra-values in the channels for the ranges between 0° ≤ α ≤ 90° and 80° ≤ β ≤ 280° . 
In addition to decreasing the effective hydraulic diameter of a cooling channel , the surface roughness also influences the local Nusselt number , which is quantified using the extracted regression model . 
This paper reports on the results of a round robin test conducted by ten X-ray micro computed tomography ( micro-CT ) laboratories with the same three selected titanium alloy ( Ti6Al4V ) laser powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) test parts . 
These parts were a 10-mm cube , a 60-mm long and 40-mm high complex-shaped bracket , and a 15-mm diameter rod . 
Previously developed protocols for micro-CT analysis of these parts were provided to all participants , including suggested scanning parameters and image analysis steps . 
No further information on the samples were provided , and they were selected from a variety of parts from a previous different type of round robin study where various L-PBF laboratories provided identical parts for micro-CT analysis at one laboratory . 
In this new micro-CT round robin test which involves various micro-CT laboratories , parts from the previous work were selected such that each part had a different characteristic flaw type , and all laboratories involved in the study analyzed the same set of parts . 
The 10-mm cube contained subsurface pores just under its top surface ( relative to build direction ) , and all participants could positively identify this . 
The complex bracket had contour pores around its outer vertical sides , and was warped with two arms deflected towards one another . 
The 15-mm diameter rod had a layered stop/start flaw , which was also positively identified by all participants . 
Differences were found among participants for quantitative evaluations , ranging from no quantitative measurement made , to under and overestimation of the values in all analyses attempted . 
This round robin provides the opportunity to highlight typical causes of errors in micro-CT scanning and image analysis as applied to additively manufactured parts . 
Some workflow variations , sources of error and ways to increase the reproducibility of such analysis workflows are discussed . 
The ultimate aim of this work is to advance the efficient use of micro-CT facilities for process optimization and quality inspections for additively manufactured products . 
The results provide confidence in the use of laboratory micro-CT but also indicate the need for further development of standards , protocols and image analysis workflows for quantitative assessment , especially for direct and quantitative comparisons between different laboratories . 
Very limited Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) processes have been developed for production of Metal Matrix Composites ( MMCs ) reinforced by ceramic . 
Most of these processes use different mixing techniques to mix metal and ceramic powder particles in order to be used in an existing AM process such as Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) process . 
The current AM techniques for MMCs fabrication have limitations due to material mixing and the AM process limitations itself . 
This paper introduces a novel AM method for fabrication of MMCs by Thermal Decomposition of Salts ( TDS ) . 
In this method inorganic salts are printed on metal powder bed to fabricate green part . 
The green part undergoes bulk sintering . 
During bulk sintering the printed inorganic salts are decomposed to fine ceramic particles to form MMC . 
This process is capable of generating MMC structures with uniformly distributed and dispersed ultra-fine ceramic particles in the metal matrix with less limitations and lower cost compared to other existing AM techniques . 
In this paper , bronze-alumina MMC was fabricated and studied by the TDS process to validate the proposed process . 
It was also shown that the TDS process can be used to fabricate other types of MMCs besides bronze-alumina due to the nature of the process . 
Design of Experiments methodology was used to study and model the effects of sintering parameters on the properties of the bronze-alumina fabricated by the TDS process . 
Due to MMCs unique properties combined with AM benefits , this novel method will be of great interest to various industries such as aerospace applications . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) promises rapid development cycles and fabrication of ready-to-use , geometrically-complex parts . 
The metallic parts produced by AM often contain highly non-equilibrium microstructures , e.g . 
chemical microsegregation and residual dislocation networks . 
While such microstructures can enhance some material properties , they are often undesirable . 
Many AM parts are thus heat-treated after fabrication , a process that significantly slows production . 
This study investigated if electropulsing , the process of sending high-current-density electrical pulses through a metallic part , could be used to modify the microstructures of AM 316 L stainless steel ( SS ) and AlSi10Mg parts fabricated by selective laser melting ( SLM ) more rapidly than thermal annealing . 
Electropulsing has shown promise as a rapid postprocessing method for materials fabricated using conventional methods , e.g . 
casting and rolling , but has never been applied to AM materials . 
For both the materials used in this study , as-fabricated SLM parts contained significant chemical heterogeneity , either chemical microsegregation ( 316 L SS ) or a cellular interdendritic phase ( AlSi10Mg ) . 
In both cases , annealing times on the order of hours at high homologous temperatures are necessary for homogenization . 
Using electropulsing , chemical microsegregation was eliminated in 316 L SS samples after 10 , 16 ms electrical pulses . 
In AlSi10Mg parts , electropulsing produced spheroidized Si-rich particles after as few as 15 , 16 ms electrical pulses with a corresponding increase in ductility . 
This study demonstrated that electropulsing can be used to modify the microstructures of AM metals . 
Architected structural metamaterials , also known as lattice , truss , or acoustic materials , provide opportunities to produce tailored effective properties that are not achievable in bulk monolithic materials . 
These topologies are typically designed under the assumption of uniform , isotropic base material properties taken from reference databases and without consideration for sub-optimal as-printed properties or off-nominal dimensional heterogeneities . 
However , manufacturing imperfections such as surface roughness are present throughout the lattices and their constituent struts create significant variability in mechanical properties and part performance . 
This study utilized a customized tensile bar with a gauge section consisting of five parallel struts loaded in a stretch ( tensile ) orientation to examine the impact of manufacturing heterogeneities on quasi-static deformation of the struts , with a focus on ultimate tensile strength and ductility . 
The customized tensile specimen was designed to prevent damage during handling , despite the sub-millimeter thickness of each strut , and to enable efficient , high-throughput mechanical testing . 
The strut tensile specimens and reference monolithic tensile bars were manufactured using a direct metal laser sintering ( also known as laser powder bed fusion or selective laser melting ) process in a precipitation hardened stainless steel alloy , 17-4PH , with minimum feature sizes ranging from 0.5-0.82 mm , comparable to minimum allowable dimensions for the process . 
Over 70 tensile stress-strain tests were performed revealing that the effective mechanical properties of the struts were highly stochastic , considerably inferior to the properties of larger as-printed reference tensile bars , and well below the minimum allowable values for the alloy . 
Pre- and post-test non-destructive analyses revealed that the primary source of the reduced properties and increased variability was attributable to heterogeneous surface topography with stress-concentrating contours and commensurate reduction in effective load-bearing area . 
This study investigates the feasibility of achieving high deposition rate using wire + arc additive manufacturing in stainless steel to reduce lead time and cost of manufacturing . 
The pulse MIG welding technique with a tandem torch was used for depositing martensitic stainless steel 17-4 pH . 
The mechanical and metallurgical properties of the manufactured component were analysed to evaluate the limitations and the extent to which the rate of deposition reaches a maximum without any failure or defect being evident in the manufactured component . 
Deposition rate of 9.5 kg/h was achieved . 
The hardness was matched for the as deposited condition . 
Thermal conductivities of metal powders for additive manufacturing were measured . 
Infiltrating gas pressure and composition influence the powder thermal conductivity . 
He infiltration yields 200 % higher thermal conductivity than Ar or N2 at 1 atm . 
Powder thermal conductivities depend weakly on temperature from 295 K to 470 K. Gas-enhanced thermal conductivity is consistent with an effective medium model . 
The thermal conductivities of five metal powders for powder bed additive manufacturing ( Inconel 718 , 17-4 stainless steel , Inconel 625 , Ti-6Al-4V , and 316L stainless steel ) were measured using the transient hot wire method . 
These measurements were conducted with three infiltrating gases ( argon , nitrogen , and helium ) within a temperature range of 295–470 K and a gas pressure range of 1.4–101 kPa . 
The measurements of thermal conductivity indicate that the pressure and the composition of the gas have a significant influence on the effective thermal conductivity of the powder , but that the metal powder properties and temperature do not . 
Our measurements improve the accuracy upon which laser parameters can be optimized in order to improve thermal control of powder beds in selective laser melting processes , especially in overhanging and cellular geometries where heat dissipation by the powder is critical . 
A fundamental understanding of spatial and temporal thermal distributions is crucial for predicting solidification and solid-state microstructural development in parts made by additive manufacturing . 
While sophisticated numerical techniques that are based on finite element or finite volume methods are useful for gaining insight into these phenomena at the length scale of the melt pool ( 100–500 μm ) , they are ill-suited for predicting engineering trends over full part cross-sections ( > 10 × 10 cm ) or many layers over long process times ( > many days ) due to the necessity of fully resolving the heat source characteristics . 
On the other hand , it is extremely difficult to resolve the highly dynamic nature of the process using purely in-situ characterization techniques [ 1 ] . 
This paper proposes a pragmatic alternative based on a semi-analytical approach to predicting the transient heat conduction during powder bed metal additive manufacturing processes . 
The model calculations were theoretically verified for selective laser melting of AlSi10Mg and electron beam melting of IN718 powders for simple cross-sectional geometries and the transient results are compared to steady state predictions from the Rosenthal equation . 
It is shown that the transient effects of the scan strategy create significant variations in the melt pool geometry and solid-liquid interface velocity , especially as the thermal diffusivity of the material decreases and the pre-heat of the process increases . 
With positive verification of the strategy , the model was then experimentally validated to simulate two point-melt scan strategies during electron beam melting of IN718 , one intended to produce a columnar and one an equiaxed grain structure . 
Through comparison of the solidification conditions ( i.e . 
transient and spatial variations of thermal gradient and liquid-solid interface velocity ) predicted by the model to phenomenological CET theory , the model accurately predicted the experimental grain structures . 
Existing commercial three-dimensional ( 3D ) printing systems based on powder bed fusion approach can normally only print a single material in each component . 
In this paper , functionally gradient materials ( FGM ) with composition variation from a copper alloy to a soda-lime glass were manufactured using a proprietary nozzle-based multi-material selective laser melting ( MMSLM ) system . 
An in situ powder mixing system was designed to mix both metal and glass powders at selective ratios and the mixed powders were dispensed with an ultrasonic vibration powder feeding system with multiple nozzles . 
From the cross section analysis of the gradient structures , glass proportion increased gradually from the metallic matrix composite ( MMC ) , transition phase to ceramic matrix composite ( CMC ) . 
The pure copper alloy joined the MMC part and the pure glass phase penetrated into the CMC part during laser processing , which anchored the glass phase , as the main mechanism of combining pure metal and pure glass by FGM in 3D printed parts . 
From results of indentation , tensile and shear tests on the gradient material samples , it showed that mechanical properties of the FGM gradually changed from ductility ( metal side ) to brittle ( glass side ) . 
The weakest part of the FGM structure occurred at the interface between transition phase and the CMC , which was also the interface between the ductile and brittle phases . 
The additive manufacturing ( AM ) process metal powder bed fusion ( PBF ) can quickly produce complex parts with mechanical properties comparable to that of wrought materials . 
However , thermal stress accumulated during Metal PBF may induce part distortion and even cause failure of the entire process . 
This manuscript is the second part of two companion manuscripts that collectively present a part-scale simulation method for fast prediction of thermal distortion in Metal PBF . 
The first part provides a fast prediction of the temperature history in the part via a thermal circuit network ( TCN ) model . 
This second part uses the temperature history from the TCN to inform a model of thermal distortion using a quasi-static thermo-mechanical model ( QTM ) . 
The QTM model distinguished two periods of Metal PBF , the thermal loading period and the stress relaxation period . 
In the thermal loading period , the layer-by-layer build cycles of Metal PBF are simulated , and the thermal stress accumulated in the build process is predicted . 
In the stress relaxation period , the removal of parts from the substrate is simulated , and the off-substrate part distortion and residual stress are predicted . 
Validation of part distortion predicted by the QTM model against both experiment and data in literature showed a relative error less than 20 % . 
This QTM , together with the TCN , offers a framework for rapid , part-scale simulations of Metal PBF that can be used to optimize the build process and parameters . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes are subject to lower stability compared to their traditional counterparts . 
The process inconsistency leads to anomalies in the build , which hinders AM ’ s broader adoption to critical structural component manufacturing . 
Therefore , it is crucial to detect any process change/anomaly in a timely and accurate manner for potential corrective operations . 
Real-time thermal image streams captured from AM processes are regarded as most informative signatures of the process stability . 
Existing state-of-the-art studies on thermal image streams focus merely on in situ sensing , feature extraction , and their relationship with process setup parameters and material properties . 
The objective of this paper is to develop a statistical process control ( SPC ) approach to detect process changes as soon as it occurs based on predefined distribution of the monitoring statistics . 
There are two major challenges : 1 ) complex spatial interdependence exists in the thermal images and current engineering knowledge is not sufficient to describe all the variability , and 2 ) the thermal images suffer from a large data volume , a low signal-to-noise ratio , and an ill structure with missing data . 
To tackle these challenges , multilinear principal component analysis ( MPCA ) approach is used to extract low dimensional features and residuals . 
Subsequently , an online dual control charting system is proposed by leveraging multivariate T2 and Q control charts to detect changes in extracted low dimensional features and residuals , respectively . 
A real-world case study of thin wall fabrication using a Laser Engineered Net Shaping ( LENS ) process is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach , and the accuracy of process anomaly detection is validated based on X-ray computed tomography information collected from the final build offline . 
In order to establish modeling and simulation ( M & S ) in support of Additive Manufacturing Processes ( AMP ) control for tailoring functional component performance by design , a methodology is introduced for identifying relevant M & S challenges . 
This exercise is meant to spur research addressing the specific issue of tailoring functional component performance by design , as well as AMP-related process optimization more generally . 
A composition abstraction that connects process control with functional performance of the multiscale modeling processes is presented , from both the forward and inverse analysis perspectives . 
A brief ontology is introduced that describes the ordering of dependency and membership of all components of a model , which serves the purpose of isolating potential challenge areas . 
Certain features of AMPs that are usually ignored by the community during modeling are a specific focus . 
Furthermore , two semantically reduced modeling approaches involving continuum abstractions for the computational domains are presented . 
The solutions of the relevant system of coupled partial differential equations are used to demonstrate both the positive and negative implications of a series of assumptions routinely made in M & S of AMPs . 
Finally , a discrete element method model is presented to highlight the challenges introduced by the specific nature of this approach . 
The additive manufacturing ( AM ) process metal powder bed fusion ( PBF ) can quickly produce complex parts with mechanical properties comparable to wrought materials . 
However , thermal stress accumulated during PBF induces part distortion , potentially yielding parts out of specification and frequently process failure . 
This manuscript is the first of two companion manuscripts that introduce a computationally efficient distortion and stress prediction algorithm that is designed to drastically reduce compute time when integrated in to a process design optimization routine . 
In this first manuscript , we introduce a thermal circuit network ( TCN ) model to estimate the part temperature history during PBF , a major computational bottleneck in PBF simulation . 
In the TCN model , we are modeling conductive heat transfer through both the part and support structure by dividing the part into thermal circuit elements ( TCEs ) , which consists of thermal nodes represented by thermal capacitances that are connected by resistors , and then building the TCN in a layer-by-layer manner to replicate the PBF process . 
In comparison to conventional finite element method ( FEM ) thermal modeling , the TCN model predicts the temperature history of metal PBF AM parts with more than two orders of magnitude faster computational speed , while sacrificing less than 15 % accuracy . 
The companion manuscript illustrates how the temperature history is integrated into a thermomechanical model to predict thermal stress and distortion . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) is a set of emerging technologies that can produce physical objects with complex geometrical shapes directly from a digital model . 
However , achieving the full potential of AM is hampered by many challenges , including the lack of predictive models that correlate processing parameters with the properties of the processed part . 
We develop a Gaussian process-based predictive model for the learning and prediction of the porosity in metallic parts produced using selective laser melting ( SLM – a laser-based AM process ) . 
More specifically , a spatial Gaussian process regression model is first developed to model part porosity as a function of SLM process parameters . 
Next , a Bayesian inference framework is used to estimate the statistical model parameters , and the porosity of the part at any given setting is predicted using the Kriging method . 
A case study is conducted to validate this predictive framework through predicting the porosity of 17-4 PH stainless steel manufacturing on a ProX 100 selective laser melting system . 
This paper presents a concept of solidifying small quantities of metal powders in an additive manner , using localized microwave heating ( LMH ) . 
The experimental results show solidification of metal powders in forms of spheres and rods ( of ∼2 mm diameter ) and extension of these rods by adding batches of powder and consolidating them locally as building blocks by LMH . 
A theoretical model applied for the LMH interaction with metal powders attributes a magnetic heating effect also to powders made of non-magnetic metals , due to eddy currents . 
The experimental observations and numerical results also suggest that micro-plasma discharges between the powder particles initiate their heating process . 
The additive LMH approach presented here is intended to extend microwave sintering capabilities , mainly known in volumetric molds , also to applications in the framework of rapid prototyping , additive manufacturing , and 3D-printing . 
Oscillating laser-arc hybrid additive manufacturing ( O-LHAM ) is developed . 
Surface roughness of O-LHAM reduces to 20 % of WAAM via laser-arc synergic effects . 
High porosity easily occurs within laser-arc hybrid additive manufacturing ( LHAM ) can be suppressed via periodical beam oscillation . 
O-LHAM has better tensile properties because of finer microstructure and lower texture content . 
A novel additive manufacturing approach integrating an oscillating laser beam and a cold metal transfer arc was developed to balance the surface accuracy , deposition efficiency , and mechanical properties of the deposited parts . 
The new method was termed as oscillating laser-arc hybrid additive manufacturing ( O-LHAM ) . 
The sample properties of the wire-arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) , laser-arc hybrid additive manufacturing ( LHAM ) , and O-LHAM processes were compared . 
First , both the surface roughness and minimum processing margin of the O-LHAM sample were reduced to 20 % of the WAAM sample , because the droplet transfer was stabilized by the laser-arc synergic effects . 
Second , the grains were refined , and the { 001 } < 100 > -cube texture content was decreased to 1.6 % , as the oscillation induced a strong stirring effect on the molten pool . 
The nondestructive X-ray test suggested that the visible porosity within the O-LHAM sample was suppressed by beam oscillation when the periodically oscillated laser keyhole could “ capture ” the bubbles , while the porosity within the LHAM sample reached 24 % . 
Due to the microstructure changes and the porosity suppression , the O-LHAM almost eliminated the anisotropy of tensile strength and improved the elongation by up to 34 % . 
Despite recent advances in our understanding of the unique mechanical behavior of natural structural materials such as nacre and human bone , traditional manufacturing strategies limit our ability to mimic such nature-inspired structures using existing structural materials and manufacturing processes . 
To this end , we introduce a customizable single-step approach for additively fabricating geometrically-free metallic-based structural composites showing directionally-tailored , location-specific properties . 
To exemplify this capability , we present a layered metal-ceramic composite not previously reported exhibiting significant directional and site-specific dependence of properties along with crack arrest ability difficult to achieve using traditional manufacturing approaches . 
Our results indicate that nature-inspired microstructural designs towards directional properties can be realized in structural components using a novel additive manufacturing approach . 
Additive Layer Manufacturing ( ALM ) of metals is rapidly changing the landscape of industrial manufacturing . 
This paper presents the PALMS process , derived from electrolytic plasma polishing , as a solution to this problem . 
The viability of the process on a scale compatible with commercial use is demonstrated with a prototype industrial implementation . 
PALMS was applied on AISI 316 stainless steel pieces produced either by ALM or by conventional machining ( CM . ) 
Surface states , microstructures and other properties were compared pre- and post-PALMS . 
Significant improvements in surface state were observed after a 10 min treatment , with a 5-fold reduction in roughness . 
ALM surfaces were not affected negatively by PALMS in any way measured , and showed slight improvements in hardness and pore density . 
Two PVD coatings ( TiN and WCC ) were finally applied Post-PALMS , to test the compatibility of the process with further industrially relevant surface treatments . 
PALMS enables good coating adhesion on ALM pieces , with improved friction and wear properties compared to their CM counterparts . 
As metal Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) becomes more widely adopted in the aerospace and orthopedic industries , there is increasing demand to improve part quality and reduce overall cost . 
The high cost of powder feedstock has raised interest in recovering unmelted powder in the build chamber and its reuse in subsequent builds . 
While degradation in powder properties with recovery and reuse can cause degradation in part properties , this topic has received rather limited attention . 
In this study the properties of Ti6Al4V metal powder are evaluated over 30 build cycles in Electron Beam Melting ( EBM ) AM . 
The morphological , microstructural , mechanical , and chemical changes are evaluated in cross-sectioned powder particles and compared to isolated control samples to understand the mechanisms of degradation . 
Results show that in response to the elevated build chamber temperature , the powder undergoes a sub-beta-transus aging heat treatment with powder reuse . 
Based on nanoindentation hardness measurements , the particles undergo an increase in near-surface hardness ( up to 2 GPa ) with respect to the core . 
Moreover , tint etching revealed an oxidized surface layers consistent with alpha case formation . 
The particle hardening appears to result from oxygen diffusion during powder recovery and not work hardening related to the mechanical aspects of that process . 
These results demonstrate the importance of managing/mitigating oxidation of metal powder feedstock to improve its reusability and increasing its overall lifetime . 
Components manufactured via Wire + Arc Additive Manufacturing are usually characterised by large columnar grains . 
This can be mitigated by introducing in-process cold rolling ; in fact , the associated local plastic deformation leads to a reduction of distortion and residual stresses , and to microstructural refinement . 
In this research , inter-pass rolling was applied with a load of 50 kN to a tantalum linear structure to assess rolling ’ s effectiveness in changing the grain structure from columnar to equiaxed , as well as in refining the grain size . 
An average grain size of 650 μm has been obtained after five cycles of inter-pass rolling and deposition . 
When the deformed layer was reheated during the subsequent deposition , recrystallisation occurred , leading to the growth of new strain-free equiaxed grains . 
The depth of the refined region has been characterised and correlated to the hardness profile developed after rolling . 
Furthermore , a random texture was formed after rolling , which should contribute to obtaining isotropic mechanical properties . 
Wire + Arc Additive Manufacture demonstrated the ability to deposit sound refractory metal components and the possibility to improve the microstructure when coupled with cold inter-pass rolling . 
An innovative wire and arc additive manufacturing variant based on plastic deformation at high temperatures was developed . 
This new variant is capable of collapsing pores that have been formed during the deposition process . 
The in-situ hot forging technique refines the grain structure and improve mechanical properties in the deposited layer . 
In this study , we propose a new variant of wire and arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) based on hot forging . 
During WAAM , the material is locally forged immediately after deposition , and in-situ viscoplastic deformation occurs at high temperatures . 
In the subsequent layer deposition , recrystallization of the previous solidification structure occurs that refines the microstructure . 
Because of its similarity with hot forging , this variant was named hot forging wire and arc additive manufacturing ( HF-WAAM ) . 
A customized WAAM torch was developed , manufactured , and tested in the production of samples of AISI316 L stainless steel . 
Forging forces of 17 N and 55 N were applied to plastically deform the material . 
The results showed that this new variant refines the solidification microstructure and reduce texture effects , as determined via high energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments , without interrupting the additive manufacturing process . 
Mechanical characterization was performed and improvements on both yield strength and ultimate tensile strength were achieved . 
Furthermore , it was observed that HF-WAAM significantly affects porosity ; pores formed during the process were closed by the hot forging process . 
Because deformation occurs at high temperatures , the forces involved are small , and the WAAM equipment does not have specific requirements with respect to stiffness , thereby allowing the incorporation of this new variant into conventional moving equipment such as multi-axis robots or 3-axis table used in WAAM . 
A bimetallic additively-manufactured structure ( BAMS ) is a type of functionally-graded multi-material structure used for achieving different complementary material properties within the same structure as well as cost optimization . 
Wire + arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) offers the capability to fabricate the BAMS in a simultaneous or sequential way . 
To fully utilize the benefits of the BAMS , the interfacial joint should be strong , and each of the constituents should have reasonable mechanical integrity . 
For this , a BAMS of low-carbon steel and austenitic-stainless steel was fabricated using a gas-metal-arc-welding ( GMAW ) -based WAAM process . 
Then , the BAMS was heat-treated at a range of 800 °C to 1100 °C and 30 min to 2 h. This resulted in 35 % and 250 % increases in the ultimate tensile strength and elongation , compared to the as-deposited BAMS . 
Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ( EDAx ) , and the Vickers hardness test were used to characterize the BAMS . 
The additive manufacturing of metals and ceramics generally uses a concentrated laser heat source to form a local melt pool that moves quickly during the process . 
The material is deposited by fast cooling and progressive solidification . 
In this study , the effects of temperature gradient and progressive solidification on residual stress were analyzed using numerical finite-element models for a single rapidly solidifying bead during the deposition process . 
Conceptual two- and three-dimensional finite element models are proposed , considering the solidification effect . 
Based on the numerical results , a reduced-order modeling strategy was proposed to efficiently reproduce the final residual stress state of single-bead deposition processes in additive manufacturing , i.e . 
sequential solidification . 
Although additive manufacturing technology is available for the direct fabrication of metal parts , the process is still in a juvenile state compared to older metal fabrication methods such as sand casting . 
Therefore , limited standards are available stipulating the use of additively-manufactured parts in critical service conditions such as extreme environments or safety components . 
However , since sand casting is suited for multiple units of parts , the time and resources needed to produce a single part through sand casting is not ideal for a competitive market . 
Although additive manufacturing or “ 3D printing ” has been combined with metal casting in the past through “ rapid casting ” to fabricate sand molds directly , the sand used is stipulated by the 3D printer . 
The use of specialized sand may result in changes to infrastructure and large amounts of additional sand required to be stored on location . 
The main question we sought to answer was if traditional foundry sand or “ non-standard ” sand could be used within a 3D printing system ? 
We report herein that the although the increase in surface roughness may be tolerable , the use of foundry sand within a 3D printer produces molds with less than optimal results , mainly due to the absence of compaction . 
Binder bleeding via the liquid binder jetting process also contributes to a loss in dimensional quality . 
The behavior of high performance super duplex stainless steel ( SDSS ) during additive manufacturing ( AM ) has been investigated using a novel arc heat treatment technique . 
Tungsten inert gas ( TIG ) arc pulses were applied on a disc shaped sample mounted on a water-cooled chamber to physically simulate AM thermal cycles . 
SDSS base metal and a duplicated additively manufactured structure ( DAMS ) were used as initial microstructures . 
Samples were melted one , five , or 15 times by arc heat treatment . 
Microstructure characterization and modelling were performed to study the evolution of microstructure and properties with successive AM cycles . 
Microstructural changes were dependent on the number of reheating cycles , cooling rate , and peak temperature . 
In particular , the DAMS austenite morphology and fraction changed after reheating to peak temperatures above 700 °C . 
Nitrides and sigma were observed in the high and low temperature heat affected zones , respectively . 
Sensitization to corrosion was more pronounced in reheated DAMS than in the base metal . 
Hardness was increased more by multiple remelting/reheating than by slow cooling . 
It was found that AM thermal cycles significantly affect SDSS properties especially for an initial microstructure similar to that produced by AM . 
Additive manufacturing is a promising and rapidly rising technology in metal processing . 
In laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) , the most applied metal additive manufacturing process , the repetitive heating and cooling cycles induce severe strains in the built material , which can have a number of adverse consequences such as deformation , cracking and decreased fatigue life that might lead to severe failure even already during processing . 
It has been reported recently that the application of laser shock peening ( LSP ) can counteract efficiently the named issues of LPBF through the introduction of beneficial compressive residual stresses in the surface regions mostly affected by tensile stresses from the manufacturing process . 
Here we demonstrate how lattice strains implied by LPBF and LSP can efficiently be characterized through diffraction contrast neutron imaging . 
Despite the spatial resolution need with regards to the significant gradients of the stress distribution and the specific microstructure , which prevent the application of more conventional methods , Bragg edge imaging succeeds to provide essential two-dimensionally spatial resolved strain maps in full field single exposure measurements . 
Two-wire TOP-TIG additive manufacturing of titanium aluminide alloys was proposed . 
The Al wire was fed in TOP-TIG welding mode but the Ti6Al4V wire was fed in conventional TIG welding mode . 
The main microstructure of the as-fabricated component is α2/γ lamellae . 
The different Al content results in the different content and distribution of the α2 phase and the γ phase . 
50 at. 
% Al content provides better mechanical properties . 
Titanium aluminide ( TiAl ) alloys are promising high-temperature structural materials in the aerospace field . 
Additive manufacturing is a desirable process for fabricating TiAl alloys . 
In the process of wire arc additive manufacturing of TiAl alloys , Al-based and Ti-based wires were used as the feedstocks . 
However , it is hard to ensure the two different wires melt synchronously under the heat of one single arc , so the desired microstructures with γ ( TiAl ) phase and α2 ( Ti3Al ) phase are hard to obtain . 
A two-wire TOP-TIG-based additive manufacturing process for TiAl alloys was proposed in this paper . 
The Ti6Al4V wire and pure Al wire were used as the feedstocks . 
The Al wire was fed in TOP-TIG mode behind the molten pool , while the Ti6Al4V wire was fed in conventional TIG mode in front of the molten pool . 
The two wires melt synchronously in a broad range of parameters . 
The compositions of the component can be controlled by adjusting the two-wire feeding speeds . 
The main microstructures of the as-fabricated component contain α2/γ lamellae colonies , equiaxed γ grains , and α2 grains . 
In the top and middle regions , when the Al content is 45 at. 
% , the structures are full α2/γ lamellae ; as the Al content increases to 50 at. 
% , some equiaxed γ distributed at the grain boundaries ; the component with 55 at. 
% Al content exhibits the structures consists of equiaxed γ with snowflake-shaped α2/γ lamellae colonies . 
In the bottom region , all components exhibit the coarse equiaxed α2 grains with γ laths . 
As the Al content increases , the α2 phase decreases , but the γ phase increases , and from the top region to the bottom region , the proportion of the α2 increases by about 52 at. 
% . 
As the Al content increases , the hardness decreases . 
The component with 50 at. 
% Al exhibits the highest compressive strength with 1762 MPa and a compressive ratio with 26.1 . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) enables the fabrication of complex designs that are difficult to create by other means . 
Metal parts manufactured by laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) can incorporate intricate design features and demonstrate desirable mechanical properties . 
The process of iteratively converging on the appropriate build parameters increases the time and cost of creating functional LPBF manufactured parts . 
This paper describes a fast , scalable method for part-scale process optimization of arbitrary geometries . 
The computational approach uses feature extraction to identify scan vectors in need of parameter adaptation and applies results from simulation-based feed forward control models . 
This method provides a framework to quickly optimize complex parts through the targeted application of models with a range of fidelity and by automating the transfer of optimization strategies to new part designs . 
The computational approach and algorithmic framework are described , a software package is implemented , the method is applied to parts with complex features , and parts are printed on a customized open architecture LPBF machine . 
CrC-Ni successfully deposited onto an AM stainless steel using cold spray coating . 
The CrC-Ni coating reduced equivalent residual stresses in the substrate surface . 
CrC-Ni coating improved the surface quality of an AM produced stainless steel . 
Crack growth mechanism is changed due to the deposition of the CrC-Ni coating . 
Multiaxial fatigue life of AM stainless steel significantly improved by the CrC-Ni coating . 
Integration of metal additive manufacturing ( AM ) and cold spray ( CS ) technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity to manufacture coated material systems with complex geometrical features . 
The application of these material systems in functionally critical components requires adequate structural integrity , particularly in the presence of cyclic loading . 
This work aims to study the multiaxial fatigue ( axial-torsional cyclic loading ) behavior of a coated material system consists of 15Cr-5Ni PH stainless steel ( 15-5 PH SS ) substrate additively manufactured by direct metal laser sintering with a layer of newly commercialized chromium carbide nickel ( CrC-Ni ) barrier coating deposited by CS coating . 
The influence of AM and CS-induced residual stresses on fatigue performance of test specimens was thoroughly studied . 
Additionally , the effect of surface roughness and processes induced defects were considered to explain the crack growth mechanism . 
Stresses assessed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction indicated a substantial accumulation of the residual stresses , particularly in the outer surface of the as fabricated 15-5 PH SS specimens . 
The state of residual stress was changed notably following the deposition of CrC-Ni coating in the axial , hoop , and radial directions of the fatigue test specimen . 
Also , CS deposition of CrC-Ni coating caused significant improvement in the surface quality of the additively manufactured components . 
Fatigue test results indicated that the CS deposition of CrC-Ni substantially enhances the fatigue life of the AM-produced 15-5 PH SS substrate in all loading conditions , particularly in the high cycle fatigue regime . 
The improvement in the fatigue life of the specimens with coating was associated with the reduced surface equivalent residual stress and improvement in the specimens ' surface condition ( i.e. 
, reduced surface roughness ) . 
In addition , the fractographic analysis of the specimen indicated although the crack tends to initiate in the surface of both as fabricated and cold sprayed specimens , the mechanism of crack growth differs notably following the CS coating . 
While the cracks tend to propagate in the planes parallel or with a small deviation from the build layers of the AM produced specimens , deposition of CrC-Ni coating increased the deviation of crack growth plane from the build layers of the substrate . 
Electromagnetic wave based laser-powder particle interactions . 
Powder features are associated with additive manufacturing process . 
New heat source model considering powder effects . 
A modified heat-source model based on electromagnetic wave theory was proposed to investigate the interactions between powder particles and a laser beam , considering the spatial distribution of particles inside the beam . 
The absorption of energy by these particles in laser directed energy deposition additive manufacturing was calculated using the proposed model , which was validated experimentally . 
Both numerical model and experiment were used to study the effects of powder velocities on the temperature variations in the additive manufacturing process . 
Results indicate that the direct heat transfer from the laser to a target can be increased if the size distribution is wider ; it also increases with the velocity of the particles . 
However , with the increase of powder-flow rate , the rate of mass transfer decreases the heat transfer . 
Melt-pool depth in melting and re-melting processes can therefore be controlled by varying these parameters . 
Wire‐arc additive manufacturing is a metal additive manufacturing process that enables the production of large components at a high deposition rate . 
This process transfers a large amount of heat to the workpiece , requiring the introduction of idle times between the deposition of subsequent layers so that the workpiece cools down . 
This procedure prevents the workpiece from collapsing and ensures a suitable interpass temperature . 
The main challenge is the selection of such an idle time capable of ensuring the required interpass temperature , because the cooling rate of the workpiece changes throughout the process , entailing the need for a different idle time between the deposition of subsequent layers to achieve a constant interpass temperature.This paper proposes an innovative approach to schedule the deposition of interlayer idle times for wire‐arc additive manufacturing process . 
The technique is based on a finite element analysis of the thermal behavior of the workpiece , by solving the heat transfer equations . 
The simulation data are processed using the developed algorithm to compute specific idle times for the deposition of each layer , thereby ensuring a constant interpass temperature . 
The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated by experiments performed on a test case component . 
The temperature data measured during the process are compared with the FE simulation results to verify the accuracy of the model . 
There is a growing interest in using recycled materials and economically produced powder in additive manufacturing processes . 
State-of-the-art powder bed fusion additive manufacturing processes typically use spherical powder that are produced using an atomization process . 
However , using irregularly shaped Ti-6Al-4V powder from the Hydride-Dehydride ( HDH ) process is more economical because fewer processing steps are required and it can use recycled material as feedstock . 
In this work , the use of HDH powder in the electron beam additive manufacturing ( EBAM ) process is investigated . 
Deposition parameters for the HDH powder were developed , followed by a detailed study of as-built porosity and microstructure . 
The powder flow characteristics were also studied , and the as-built part porosity was compared to the parts built using spherical atomized powder . 
This work demonstrates the successful use of non-spherical HDH powder in the EBAM process . 
The extension of metal additive manufacturing ( AM ) to non-weldable Ni-based superalloys remains a challenge for the electron beam melting process . 
Various cracking mechanisms , including solidification , liquation , strain-age , and ductility dip cracking , make it difficult to fabricate traditionally non-weldable Ni-based superalloys using the AM process . 
Because airfoil geometries are highly complicated , the correspondingly complex thermal signatures lead to various types of cracking in geometries that are under severe mechanical restraints during the printing process . 
This work aims to understand the correlations between cracking , scan strategy , and part geometry in airfoil geometries . 
Crack locations were monitored via an in-situ near-infrared camera during printing . 
A part-scale finite element method ( FEM ) was used to reveal cracking mechanisms . 
New scan strategies that avoided cracking were utilized in an FEM simulation . 
The present work demonstrates the potential for scan strategy optimization to manipulate stress distribution and the resultant microstructure of parts for industrial applications . 
Recent work in metal additive manufacturing ( AM ) suggests that mechanical properties may vary with feature size ; however , these studies do not provide a statistically robust description of this phenomenon , nor do they provide a clear causal mechanism . 
Because of the huge design freedom afforded by 3D printing , AM parts typically contain a range of feature sizes , with particular interest in smaller features , so the size effect must be well understood in order to make informed design decisions . 
This work investigates the effect of feature size on the stochastic mechanical performance of laser powder bed fusion tensile specimens . 
A high-throughput tensile testing method was used to characterize the effect of specimen size on strength , elastic modulus and elongation in a statistically meaningful way . 
The effective yield strength , ultimate tensile strength and modulus decreased strongly with decreasing specimen size : all three properties were reduced by nearly a factor of two as feature dimensions were scaled down from 6.25 mm to 0.4 mm . 
Hardness and microstructural observations indicate that this size dependence was not due to an intrinsic change in material properties , but instead the effects of surface roughness on the geometry of the specimens . 
Finite element analysis using explicit representations of surface topography shows the critical role surface features play in creating stress concentrations that trigger deformation and subsequent fracture . 
The experimental and finite element results provide the tools needed to make corrections in the design process to more accurately predict the performance of AM components . 
A hybrid manufacturing supply chain based on metal Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) is proposed . 
Adding capacity to existing AM hubs is preferred over establishing new AM hubs at current demand . 
The ever-growing applications of Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) in the production of low volume- high value metal parts can be attributed to improving AM processing capabilities and complex design freedom . 
However , secondary post-processing using traditional processes such as machining , grinding , heat treatment and hot isostatic pressing , i.e. 
, Hybrid Manufacturing , is required to achieve Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing ( GD & T ) , surface finish and desired mechanical properties . 
It is often challenging for most traditional manufacturers to participate in the rapidly evolving supply chain of direct digital manufacturing ( DDM ) through in-house investments in cost prohibitive metal AM . 
This research investigates a system of strategically-located AM hubs which can integrate hybrid-AM with the capabilities and excess capacity in multiple traditional manufacturing facilities . 
Using North American Industry Classification System ( NAICS ) data for machine shops in the U.S. , an uncapacitated facility location model is used to determine the optimal locations for AM hub centers based on : ( 1 ) geographical data , ( 2 ) demand and ( 3 ) cost of hybrid-AM processing . 
Results from this study have identified : ( a ) candidate US counties to build AM hubs , ( b ) total cost ( fixed , operational and transportation ) and ( c ) capacity utilization of the AM hubs . 
It was found that uncapacitated facility location models identified demand centroid as the optimal location and was affected only by AM utilization rate whereas a constrained p-median model identified 22 AM hub locations as the initial sites for AM hubs which grows to 44 AM hubs as demand increases . 
It was also found that transportation cost was not a significant factor in the hybrid-AM supply chain . 
Findings from this study will help both AM companies and traditional manufacturers to determine location in the U.S and key factors to advance the metal hybrid-AM supply chain . 
In this paper , maraging steel powder was deposited on top of an H13 tool steel using laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) technique . 
The mechanical properties , microstructure , and interfacial characteristics of the additively manufactured MS1-H13 bimetals were investigated using different mechanical and microstructural techniques . 
Several uniaxial tensile tests and micro-hardness indentations were performed to identify the mechanical properties of the additively manufactured bimetal . 
Advanced electron microscopy techniques including electron backscatter diffraction and transmission electron microscopy were used to identify the mechanism of interface formation . 
In addition , the microstructure of the additively manufactured maraging steel along with the conventionally fabricated substrate-H13 were studied . 
It was concluded that , a very narrow interface was formed between the additively manufactured maraging steel and the conventional H13 without forming cracks or discontinuities . 
The first deposited layers possessed the highest hardness due to grain size refinement , solid solution strengthening , and cellular solidification structure . 
Finally , under uniaxial tensile loading , the additively manufactured bimetal steel failed from the underlying tool steel , indicating a robust interface . 
Thermomechanical analyses of WAAM by implicit FEM and explicit FEM were compared . 
Explicit FEM can be greatly accelerated ( 30,000× ) using time scaling technique . 
Real-time simulation of WAAM was achieved for a large-scale build ( 500 × 40 × 5 mm3 ) . 
Developed FEMs all showed high accuracy in predicting residual stress and distortion . 
This study aims to advance the structural analysis of wire and arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) by considering the thermomechanical features inherent in direct energy deposition . 
Simulation approaches including the iterative substructure method ( ISM ) , dynamic mesh refining method ( DMRM ) , and graphics processing unit ( GPU ) based explicit finite element method ( FEM ) were developed for accelerating additive manufacturing stress analysis that is very time consuming by conventional numerical methods . 
The residual stress and distortion of two large builds were analyzed , showing very consistent numerical results and good agreement with experiments . 
Compared with the commercial software Abaqus , the novel approaches reduced the computational cost substantially without compromising accuracy . 
Such high-fidelity modeling approaches will be very useful for building up a digital twin of WAAM to reduce development time and cost . 
WAAM ( Wire-Arc-Additive-Manufacturing ) is a metal additive manufacturing process using arc welding to create large components with high deposition rate . 
The workpiece quality and the process productivity are strongly dependent both on the process parameters ( wire feed speed , voltage and current ) and on the selected deposition path . 
Currently , the CAM ( Computer-Aided-Manufacturing ) software dedicated to WAAM rely on a multi-pass strategy to create the component layers , i.e . 
each layer is built overlapping multiple welding passes . 
However , since WAAM can create wide layers , a single pass strategy can improve the process efficiency when dealing with thin walled components . 
This paper proposes CAM software dedicated to WAAM , using a single pass strategy . 
The proposed solution uses a midsurface representation of the workpiece as input , to generate the deposition toolpath . 
A specific strategy is developed and proposed for each one of the selected features , with the aim of minimizing the geometrical errors and to ensure the required machining allowances for the subsequent finishing operations . 
The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified manufacturing a test case . 
The Wire-Arc Additive Manufacturing ( WAAM ) process is an increasingly attractive method for producing porosity-free metal components . 
However , the residual stresses and distortions resulting from the WAAM process are major concerns as they not only influence the part tolerance but can also cause premature failure in the final component during service . 
The current paper presents a method for using neutron diffraction to measure residual stresses in Fe3Al intermetallic wall components that have been in-situ additively fabricated using the WAAM process with different post-production treatments . 
By using averaging methods during the experimental setup and data processing , more reliable residual stress results are obtained from the acquired neutron diffraction data . 
In addition , the present study indicates that the normal residual stresses are significant compared to normal butt/fillet welding samples , which is caused by the large temperature gradient in this direction during the additive layer depositions . 
Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) presents unprecedented opportunities to enable design freedom in parts that are unachievable via conventional manufacturing . 
However , AM-processed components generally lack the necessary performance metrics for widespread commercial adoption . 
We present a novel AM processing and design approach using removable heat sink artifacts to tailor the mechanical properties of traditionally low strength and low ductility alloys . 
The design approach is demonstrated with the Fe-50 at. 
% Co alloy , as a model material of interest for electromagnetic applications . 
AM-processed components exhibited unprecedented performance , with a 300 % increase in strength and an order-of-magnitude improvement in ductility relative to conventional wrought material . 
These results are discussed in the context of product performance , production yield , and manufacturing implications toward enabling the design and processing of high-performance , next-generation components , and alloys . 
Rib-web structures are used for lightweight design in various applications . 
The most prominent cases are found in aerospace engineering , where intricate structures are produced by forging and subsequent machining or by machining from solid blocks of material . 
Due to the large scrap rate involved in conventional manufacturing , rib-web structures are suitable applications for additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes . 
Among the AM processes , wire-arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) is highly suitable for rib-web structures due to its high deposition rate and the potential to manufacture large-size parts . 
In WAAM , the welding strategy greatly influences the properties and quality of deposited parts . 
With an increasing number of starts and stops , the danger of uneven material build-up and welding defects increases . 
This study presents a novel strategy for generating optimal tool paths for WAAM of lightweight rib-web structures , mitigating the disadvantages of discontinuous welding paths such as welding defects and uneven build-up . 
When two or more weld beads are deposited on each edge , the vertices of the rib-web structure may suffer from underfilling . 
It is shown that this can be avoided by a correction strategy , which consists in manufacturing the part once , evaluating the size of voids in the junctions , and computing a correction to deposit the required amount of material into the center of the junction . 
While this strategy may be used if a single part is considered , it is shown that the tool path correction to be applied to arbitrary junction geometries can be represented by a neural network that is derived from an experimental database consisting of representative junction types . 
With this approach , paths for any rib-web geometry can be generated , which saves lead time in variant-rich production . 
Locally dispensing fine and irregular dry powders with a stable and continuous flow rate for additive manufacturing purposes is challenging . 
Ultrasonic vibration is an effective tool to deposit spherical powders . 
However , the existing single ultrasonic vibration actuated powder dispenser could cause powder jamming and blockage when dispensing irregularly shaped ceramic particles . 
In this study , we demonstrate a hybrid ultrasonic and motor vibration integrated dispensing method to successfully deposit irregularly shaped silicon carbide ( SiC ) powder and SiC and metal powder mixtures . 
Flow rate experiments on mixed SiC-316 L powders with SiC volume fractions of 25 vol % , 40 vol % , and 50 vol % , indicated that the powder flow rate was determined by powder packing density after pre-mixing and before deposition . 
A lower packing density resulted in a higher powder flow rate . 
Both the SiC particle size and SiC volume fraction affected the final mixed powder packing density . 
The SiC-316 L mixture with 40 vol % of 320 grit SiC powder had the highest powder flow rate ( 37.53 μL/s ) . 
Finally , the new powder deposition approach was successfully used for laser powder bed fusion manufacturing of a double helix structure made of a 316 L stainless steel and a SiC-316 L mixture . 
Such a powder dispensing technology has the potential to be applied in powder materials involved in additive manufacturing and pharmacy industries . 
Direct observation and quantification of melt pool evolution during LPBF through in-situ x-ray imaging . 
Melt pool undergoes different melt regimes and exhibits orders-of-magnitude volume change under a constant input energy density . 
Laser absorption variation under constant input energy density is an important cause of melt pool variation . 
Laser absorption variation stems from the separate effects of laser power and scan speed on depression zone development . 
Size and shape of a melt pool play a critical role in determining the microstructure in additively manufactured metals . 
However , it is very challenging to directly characterize the size and shape of the melt pool beneath the surface of the melt pool during the additive manufacturing process . 
Here , we report the direct observation and quantification of melt pool variation during the laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) additive manufacturing process under constant input energy density by in-situ high-speed high-energy x-ray imaging . 
We show that the melt pool can undergo different melting regimes and both the melt pool dimension and melt pool volume can have orders-of-magnitude change under a constant input energy density . 
Our analysis shows that the significant melt pool variation can not be solely explained by the energy dissipation rate . 
We found that energy absorption changes significantly under a constant input energy density , which is another important cause of melt pool variation . 
Our further analysis reveals that the significant change in energy absorption originates from the separate roles of laser power and scan speed in depression zone development . 
The results reported here are important for understanding the laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process and guiding the development of better metrics for processing parameter design . 
Successful round robin test conducted using various additive manufactured part producers of the same test parts . 
Various intentional and unintentional defects identified . 
Porosity/defect distribution extends from coupon samples to complex parts in general . 
Micro computed tomography ( microCT ) allows non-destructive insights into the quality of additively manufactured parts and the processes that produce them . 
A round robin test was conducted as follows : a series of standard test procedures ( part sizes and shapes and test protocols ) were applied – using one microCT system – to identical parts produced on a variety of metal additive manufacturing systems ( specifically laser powder bed fusion systems ) . 
These are simple parts : a 10 mm cube , a 15 mm diameter vertical-built cylinder and a basic topology optimized example part – a bracket . 
The 15 mm diameter cylinder acts as witness specimen for the build of the complex part . 
All these were produced in Ti6Al4V , and in some cases parts were provided with variations in process parameters or manufacturing conditions which led to different types of intentional manufacturing flaws or defects . 
The major result shown is that the analysis of a simple 10 mm cube clearly identifies incorrect process parameters even for very low levels of porosity , with unique porosity distributions and characteristics . 
The witness specimen ( 15 mm cylinder ) allows clear identification of layered stop-start flaws , at a resolution better than a complex part built alongside it , allowing to identify defective builds . 
The results indicate a successful first step at standardized microCT analysis procedures for improvement of processes and quality control in additive manufacturing . 
Understanding microstructural development in additive manufacturing under highly non-equilibrium cooling conditions and the consequent effects on mechanical properties of the final component is critical for accelerating industrial adoption of these manufacturing techniques . 
In this study , simple but effective theoretical solidification models are recalled to evaluate their ability to predict of microstructural features in additive manufacturing applications . 
As a case study , the resulting solidification microstructure selection maps are created to predict the stable growth modality and the columnar to equiaxed transition ( CET ) of an Al-10Si-0.5Mg alloy processed via Selective Laser Melting . 
The potential of this method in microstructural predictions for additively manufactured products , as well as outstanding challenges and limitations , are discussed . 
The present theoretical/experimental investigation deals with the problem of performing the static assessment of notched components made of additively manufactured Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene ( ABS ) . 
The notch strength of this 3D-printed material was investigated by testing a large number of specimens , with the experiments being run not only under tension , but also under three-point bending . 
The samples contained geometrical features of different sharpness and were manufactured ( flat on the build plate ) by changing the printing direction . 
Being supported by the experimental evidence , the hypothesis was formed that the mechanical response of 3D-printed ABS can be modelled effectively by treating it as a material that is linear-elastic , brittle , homogenous and isotropic . 
This simplifying hypothesis allowed the Theory of Critical Distances to be employed also to assess static strength of 3D-printed ABS containing geometrical features . 
The validation exercise based on the experimental results being generated demonstrates that this theory is highly accurate , with its use leading to predictions falling mainly within an error interval of about ±20 % . 
This level of accuracy is certainly satisfactory especially because this static assessment methodology can be used in situations of engineering relevance by making use of the results obtained by solving standard linear-elastic Finite Element models . 
Material calibration was carried out for DMLS-MS1 and hybrid DMLS-MS1-H13 . 
Finite element modeling for Rockwell hardness test was implemented . 
A combined FEM-analytical approach was developed to calculate fatigue life of DMLS-MS1 . 
Finite element model of welding process on DMLS-MS1 was accomplished . 
Fatigue life of welded DMLS-MS1 was calculated using the developed FE framework . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) has been recently used to deposit metal powder on top of conventional metals . 
Of particular interest is hybrid additively manufactured steels which were found to be a suitable solution to benefit from features of each metal at different spots of a mechanical component . 
Due to its superior mechanical characteristics , maraging steel ( MS1 ) has recently attracted tremendous attention for additive manufacturing applications mainly in aerospace , tool and die , and marine industries or to be 3D printed on top of other metals as a hybrid product using different techniques such as Direct Metal Laser Sintering ( DMLS ) . 
In this paper a predictive finite element ( FE ) model and a combined analytical-numerical framework were developed to evaluate the mechanical performance of hybrid additively manufactured components and facilitate the prediction of hardness and fatigue life of these parts . 
The proposed tools were employed in two scopes : First to simulate the indentation hardness test of hybrid DMLS-MS1-H13 steels ; and second to calculate fatigue crack nucleation life of maraging steel including defects ( i.e . 
welding residual stresses ) . 
Parameters such as local and global displacements , changes in Young ’ s modulus , and hardness , high cycle fatigue life , welding temperature distribution , and residual stress were investigated . 
The hardness experiments were carried out to improve the reported data found in similar studies , which were used as the main resource to validate the proposed numerical framework . 
The capabilities of the presented frameworks enable this work to target existing ambiguities in additively manufactured mechanical components . 
A net-shape synthesis process has been used to convert different isovolumetric precursor mixtures composed of either 100 vol % 86/14 molar Cr/Cr2O3 or 50 vol % 86/14 molar Cr/Cr2O3 with 50 vol % Cr3C2 to form multilayer chromium carbide materials suitable for reactive powder bed fusion additive manufacturing . 
Selective deposition was performed by patterning precursor layers using a masked high-volume , low-pressure slurry spray deposition technique . 
Following deposition , each layer was thermochemically converted to Cr3C2 at 950 °C in a gas atmosphere containing 76 vol. 
% Ar , 4 vol. 
% H2 , 20 % vol. 
% CH4 . 
This process was repeated multiple times to construct layered structures representative of additively manufactured refractory ceramics . 
X-ray diffraction characterization and quantitative phase analysis of each converted layer indicated that the average phase fraction of Cr3C2 present in the multi-layered samples following conversion from Cr/Cr2O3 and Cr3C2/Cr/Cr2O3 precursors was 94.5 wt % ( SD = 0.92 ) and 98.8 wt % ( SD = 0.21 ) respectively . 
Despite the higher phase fraction of Cr3C2 produced by the three-component precursor system , SEM imaging of the sample microstructures and fracture analysis indicated that increased bonding occurred in Cr3C2 produced by conversion of Cr/Cr2O3 . 
This reaction-induced bonding enhanced the interlayer mechanical integrity . 
The results in this work demonstrate the use of isovolumetric reaction synthesis techniques that are broadly applicable for non-oxide ceramic production using reactive additive manufacturing methods . 
A novel hydrodynamic cavitation abrasive finishing ( HCAF ) process was developed . 
Internal surface finishing was done using cavitation-aided microparticle abrasion . 
Synergistic effects enhanced the material removal and surface finish up to 80 % . 
Surface finishing additive-manufactured ( AM ) internal channels is challenging . 
In this study , a novel hydrodynamic cavitation abrasive finishing ( HCAF ) technique is proposed and its feasibility for surface finishing is analyzed . 
Surface finishing is performed using controlled hydrodynamic cavitation erosion and microparticle abrasion phenomena . 
Various surface-finishing conditions were employed to investigate material removal and surface finish enhancement via synergistic effects in the HCAF process . 
To quantify the contributions from each erosion mechanism , additively manufactured AlSi10Mg internal channels were surface finished in isolated conditions of a ) liquid impingement , b ) absolute cavitation erosion , c ) absolute abrasion , and d ) cavitation-assisted microparticle abrasion . 
The erosion rate and total thickness loss were established as the measurands to quantify the intensity of the surface finish . 
A synergy map is proposed to quantify the contribution from the synergistic effects from hydrodynamic cavitation abrasive finishing . 
The synergistic material-removal mechanism is explained using surface morphology observations . 
Hydrodynamic cavitation gradually removed loosely attached surface asperities in AM internal channels . 
The findings suggest that the synergistic effects in hydrodynamic cavitation abrasive finishing are effective in enhancing the material removal and surface-finish quality of AM components . 
Tracking codes are embedded inside 3D printed parts for product authentication . 
Imaging method like micro-CT can retrieve the internal tracking code information . 
Micro-CT images of the code present poor contrast and imaging artifact challenges . 
Pre- and post-processing enable automatic and robust image reading and verification . 
The developed image processing methods have no dependence on the original image . 
The layer-by-layer printing process of additive manufacturing methods provides new opportunities to embed identification codes inside parts during manufacture . 
The availability of reverse engineering tools has increased the risk of counterfeit part production and new authentication technologies such as the one proposed in this paper are required for many applications including aerospace components and medical implants and devices . 
The embedded codes are read by imaging techniques such as micro-Computed Tomography ( micro-CT ) scanners or radiography . 
The work presented in this paper is focused on developing methods that can improve the quality of the recovered micro-CT scanned code images such that they can be interpreted by standard code reader technology . 
Inherent low contrast and the presence of imaging artifacts are the main challenges that need to be addressed . 
Image processing methods are developed to address these challenges using titanium and aluminum alloy specimens containing embedded quick response ( QR ) codes . 
The proposed techniques for recovering the embedded codes are based on a combination of Mathematical Morphology and an innovative de-noising algorithm based on optimal image filtering techniques . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) , commonly referred to as 3D printing , was originally used for rapid prototyping . 
However , research into new technologies has allowed AM to become applicable far beyond prototype fabrication . 
Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( ORNL ) , sponsored by the Office of Naval Research , has designed and developed an anthropomorphic seven degree-of-freedom ( DOF ) dual arm hydraulic manipulator using metal AM technologies . 
The titanium manipulators are designed for subsea use . 
This article will detail the novel AM design of the hydraulic manipulator system . 
It will cover the manipulators ’ pitch and rotary link designs , custom valves , hydraulic power unit , and the motivation for a dual arm design . 
In all manufacturing processes , there are several factors for which the final product exhibits dimensional and shape deviations from its ideal nominal geometry . 
In additive manufacturing ( AM ) and 3D printing , a part is built layerwise in a single manufacturing step and is often net-shaped . 
In most cases , no finishing operation is applied to change the dimensions of the product , apart from a reduction of the superficial roughness through sandblasting or polishing . 
Therefore , knowing the dimensional tolerance of AM processes in advance is of fundamental importance , but little information is currently available in the literature . 
A benchmarking analysis of three different AM systems for polymers is presented in this paper . 
The compared machines are based on different AM techniques which are fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) , selective laser sintering ( SLS ) and Arburg plastic freeforming ( APF ) . 
The dimensional accuracy of the machines has been defined using the ISO IT grades of a reference artifact . 
In the analysis of the benchmarking results , a specific focus is made on the importance of the thermal household in SLS and a parameter named SLS modulus is proposed to identify critical heat concentrations in the powder bed that may influence the dimensional accuracy of the manufactured part . 
Wire and arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) , which is an additive manufacturing ( AM ) process that uses metal materials , has a higher fabricated volume per unit time but a lower fabricated shape accuracy compared with other methods . 
With this process , the surface roughness of fabricated objects is several hundred micrometers or more , and a finishing process is necessary . 
However , the fabricated objects after finishing can have uncut areas or can be overcut during the finishing process owing to the large difference between the target and actual fabricated shapes . 
Therefore , the objective of this study is to develop a cooperative system for WAAM and machining that includes a process that measures the shape of the fabricated object . 
First , the three-dimensional ( 3-D ) shape of the fabricated object was measured by structure from motion ( SfM ) and compared with the 3-D computer-aided design ( CAD ) data . 
Second , the original design was modified , and the amount of material removed during finish cutting was optimized with the developed software . 
Finally , the fabricated hollow object was finished by milling to obtain a uniform wall thickness without any defects . 
A 3-D fabricated object was measured by SfM , and it was observed that the measurement accuracy was sufficiently high for the requirements of the system . 
In addition , a fabricated hollow quadrangular pyramid with a closed shape was machined with a computer numerical control ( CNC ) machine tool with the modification of the work origin . 
As a result , the amount of material removed during finish cutting was optimized , and the inclined wall thickness was uniform compared with that without modification . 
In addition , a hollow turbine blade with a freeform shape was successfully finished without any defects . 
A wire arc additive manufactured sample with intentional defects is studied . 
Owing to a lack of standards and codes , a calibration method was introduced . 
The known size defects were used for calibration of the ultrasonic system . 
In this study , Wire + Arc Additive Manufacture ( WAAM ) was employed to manufacture a steel specimen with intentionally embedded defects which were subsequently used for calibration of an ultrasonic phased array system and defect sizing . 
An ABB robot was combined with the Cold Metal Transfer ( CMT ) Gas Metal Arc ( GMA ) process to deposit 20 layers of mild steel . 
Tungsten-carbide balls ( ø1-3 mm ) were intentionally embedded inside the additive structure after the 4th , 8th , 12th and 18th layers to serve as ultrasonic reflectors , simulating defects within the WAAM sample . 
An ultrasonic phased array system , consisting of a 5 MHz 64 Element phased array transducer , was used to inspect the WAAM sample non-destructively . 
The majority of the reflectors were detected successfully using Total Focusing Method ( TFM ) , proving that the tungsten carbide balls were successfully embedded during the WAAM process and also that these are good ultrasonic reflectors . 
Owing to a lack of standards and codes for the ultrasonic inspection of WAAM samples ( Lopez et al. 
, 2018 ) , a calibration method and step-by-step inspection strategy were introduced and then used to estimate the size and shape of an unknown lack of fusion ( LoF ) indication . 
Corrosion behavior and biocompatibility of AM ( SLM ) and wrought 316 L SS are evaluated in physiological environment containing complexing agent i.e . 
Ecorr for the SLM 316 L SS is consistently higher and breakdown potential , Ebd , is more than 3 times higher compared to the wrought . 
SLM sample exhibits wider passive region and higher charge transfer resistance ( Rt ) ( approximately 1.5 to 2.5 times ) . 
The SLM part shows better cell proliferation . 
In order to mitigate potential implant failures , it is essential to determine the corrosion behavior of biomaterials in a realistic physiological environment . 
In order to simulate the real oxidative nature of human body fluid , this research considers the effects of a complexing agent while determining the corrosion behavior of 316L stainless steel ( SS ) that has been fabricated by Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) process . 
the citrate ion , in Phosphate Buffer Saline ( PBS ) solution strongly affects the passivation behavior of 316L SS by complex species formation . 
However , due to a rapid solidification process , the microstructural properties of the additively manufactured metal are not similar to that of the conventionally manufactured counterpart . 
The microstructure of the SLM 316L SS contains refined sub-grains within each coarse grain and the formation of micro-inclusions i.e . 
The SLM 316L SS had better pitting resistance and passive film stability . 
Ecorr for the SLM 316L SS was consistently higher and the breakdown potential , Ebd , was more than three times higher compared to the wrought counterpart as determined by cyclic potentiodynamic polarization . 
Moreover , the SLM sample had a wider passive region and higher charge transfer resistance ( Rt ) ( approximately 1.5 to 2.5 times ) as determined by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy , respectively . 
In addition , the attachment and proliferation tendency of MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast cells were studied to evaluate biocompatibility . 
The SLM part had better cell proliferation . 
To summarize , in a physiological environment , the SLM 316L SS outperformed the conventional wrought 316L SS in terms of corrosion resistance and biocompatibility . 
Wire arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) has become a promising metal 3D printing technology for fabricating large-scale and complex-shaped components . 
One major problem that limits the application of WAAM is the difficulty in controlling the dimensional accuracy under constantly changing interlayer temperatures . 
During the deposition process , as the wall height increases , the heat accumulates on the upper layers , which leads to the variation of the layer dimensions . 
Normal practices such as introducing idle time and actively cooling the workpiece to mitigate such problems lack efficiency and practicality , respectively . 
A novel process planning strategy is proposed in this paper and aims to achieve a continuous deposition process while ensuring dimensional accuracy . 
With the aid of a finite element model , the typical thermal transfer cycle of the workpiece was analyzed and then divided into different stages . 
When depositing material , the interlayer temperature of the subsequent layers can be predicted using the developed algorithm . 
Hence , the process parameters ( e.g. 
, wire feed speed and travel speed ) can be varied according to the predicted interlayer temperature using the developed adaptive process model , and this will ensure the uniform layer dimensions . 
The result shows that such technique succeeds in a continuous fabrication of the component with high accuracy and efficiency . 
2219-Al specimens with no cracks and less pores were fabricated by novel laser-TIG hybrid additive manufacturing . 
The mechanical properties were higher than that fabricated by conventional TIG , CMT or SLM . 
The presence of laser could refine grains and improve the uniformity of elements and eutectics . 
Owing to its high strength to weight ratio , Al–Cu alloy is extensively used in the aeronautic and aerospace industries . 
However , there are some shortcomings in the additive manufacturing of Al–Cu alloy , such as cracks and poor strength . 
In this work , Al–Cu ( 2219-Al ) specimens with excellent mechanical properties were fabricated by laser-Tungsten Inert Gas ( TIG ) hybrid additive manufacturing . 
From the microstructural studies , the average grain size in the laser zone ( LZ ) decreased to 14.4 μm , which was approximately 40.3 % smaller than that in the arc zone ( AZ ) . 
Its crystal orientation relationship was described as [ 110 ] α∥ [ 002 ] θ , ( 110 ) α∥ ( 002 ) θ between the α-Al matrix and the θ phase . 
Meanwhile , the θ′ phase characterized a good coherent relationship with the α-Al matrix , which resulted in low phase boundary energy . 
Furthermore , the deposited specimens exhibited a yield strength of 155.5 ± 7.9 MPa and an ultimate tensile strength of 301.5 ± 16.7 MPa , with an elongation of 12.8 ± 2.8 % . 
These mechanical properties were higher than in specimens fabricated by TIG , CMT and SLM methods . 
The improved properties were predominately related to the smaller size of eutectics , the uniform distribution of Cu and the semi-coherent θ′ phases in the LZ . 
The combined effect of laser and arc can yield components with excellent mechanical properties , promoting the material for an expansive range of applications . 
New microstructural features were found in the TiAl alloy manufactured using the gas tungsten arc welding-based additive manufacturing technology . 
The ion-irradiation responses of the new microstructure features were investigated in-situ via irradiation with 1 MeV Kr2+ ions at room and 873 K. Examination of the microstructure showed that the typical lamellar microstructure consisting of α2-Ti3Al and γ-TiAl phases formed α2/γ lamellar interfaces and γ/γ twin boundaries . 
Apart from this , the γ lamellae were also found to form γ/γ lamellar boundaries with the two γ lamellae in the same orientation or the < 10-1 > // < 411 > orientation relationship . 
This is not observed in the TiAl alloys fabricated using traditional alloy fabrication methods . 
Kr ion-irradiation at room and elevated temperatures resulted in no significant difference in the morphologies of most radiation-induced defects in the < 411 > orientated γ lamellae and the < 10-1 > orientated γ lamellae . 
However , the areas of the new boundaries exhibited different damage morphologies in comparison with the traditional γ/γ twin boundaries . 
The formation mechanisms of the new microstructural features formed in the additive manufacturing process and their irradiation behaviour are investigated and discussed . 
Additive manufacturing can produce parts with complex geometries in fewer steps than conventional processing , which leads to cost reduction and a higher quality of goods . 
One potential application is the production of molds and dies with conformal cooling for injection molding , die casting , and forging . 
AISI H13 tool steel is typically used in these applications because of its high hardness at elevated temperatures , high wear resistance , and good toughness . 
However , available data on the processing of H13 steel by additive manufacturing are still scarce . 
Thus , this study focused on the processability of H13 tool steel by powder bed fusion and its microstructural characterization . 
Laser power ( 97−216 W ) and scan speed ( 300−700 mm/s ) were varied , and the consolidation of parts , common defects , solidification structure , microstructure , and hardness were evaluated . 
Over the range of processing parameters , microstructural features were mostly identical , consisting of a predominantly cellular solidification structure of martensite and 19.8 % –25.9 % of retained austenite . 
Cellular/dendritic solidification structure displayed C , Cr , and V segregation toward cell walls . 
The thermal cycle resulted in alternating layers of heat-affected zones , which varied somewhat in hardness and microstructure . 
Retained austenite was correlated to the solidification structure and displayed a preferential orientation with { 001 } //build direction . 
Density and porosity maps were obtained by helium gas pycnometry and light optical microscopy , respectively , and , along with linear crack density , were used to determine appropriate processing parameters for H13 tool steel . 
Thermal diffusivity , thermal conductivity , and thermal capacity were measured to determine dimensionless processing parameters , which were then compared to others reported in the literature . 
The complex , nonequilibrium physical , chemical , and metallurgical nature of additive manufacturing ( AM ) tends to lead to uncontrollable and unpredictable material and structural properties . 
In this study , we investigated a laser opto-ultrasonic dual ( LOUD ) detection approach for simultaneous and real-time detection of elemental compositions , structural defects , and residual stress in aluminium ( Al ) alloy components during wire + arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) processes . 
In this approach , a pulsed-laser beam was used to excite the surfaces of Al alloy samples to generate ultrasound and optical spectra . 
As a result , the compositional information can be obtained from the optical spectra , while the structural defects and residual stress distributions can be extracted from the ultrasonic signals . 
The silicon ( Si ) and copper ( Cu ) compositions obtained from optical spectral analyses are consistent with those obtained from the electron-probe microanalyses ( EPMA ) . 
The 1 mm blowhole and the residual stress distribution of the sample were detected by the ultrasonic signals in the LOUD detection , which shows consistency with the conventional ultrasonic testing ( UT ) . 
Both results indicate that the LOUD detection holds the promising of becoming an effective testing method for AM processes to ensure quality control and process feedback . 
Wire + Arc Additive Manufacturing ( WAAM ) has already proven to be successful for the production of large metal parts . 
However , there are still no specific standards available to label the quality requirements of the parts produced by WAAM and this is preventing a more widespread adoption of the technique.A crucial step towards the quality assurance of WAAM parts will be the development of Non-Destructive Testing ( NDT ) systems capable of identifying defects while parts are being produced . 
In this regard , Eddy Current Testing ( ECT ) can play a significant role , by allowing the inspection of both ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic materials , with high speeds and without contact with the material surface . 
The limitation here is that commercial ECT targets only the inspection of surface and subsurface defects.This study is focused on the development of a NDT system which includes customized ECT probes for the inline layer-by-layer detection of defects in aluminium WAAM samples . 
Results revealed that the developed EC probes were able to locate artificial defects : at depths up to 5 mm ; with a thickness as small as 350 μm ; with the probe up to 5 mm away from the inspected sample surface.The developed ECT probes proved to surpass the limitation of commercial ones . 
Also , these probes were able to overcome the limitations caused by the surface roughness of the samples and the high temperatures involved in the deposition process . 
These preliminary results represent an important step for the development of NDT systems for WAAM . 
By using filaments comprising metal or ceramic powders and polymer binders , solid metal and ceramic parts can be created by combining low-cost fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) with debinding and sintering . 
In this work , we explored a fabrication route using a FFF filament filled with 316 L steel powder at 55 vol.- % . 
We investigated the printing , debinding and sintering parameters and optimized them with respect to the mechanical properties of the final part . 
Special focus was placed on debinding and sintering in order to obtain components of low residual porosity . 
Solvent debinding of the printed green bodies created an internal network of interconnected pores and was followed by thermal debinding . 
Thermal debinding allowed for complete removal of the remaining binder and produced mechanically stable brown parts . 
Sintering at 1360 °C provided densification of the parts and generated nearly isotropic linear shrinkage of about 20 % . 
Using optimized parameters , it was possible to fabricate 316 L steel components with a density greater than 95 % via the material extrusion additive manufacturing , debinding and sintering route , with achievable deflections in a 3-point bending test similar to rolled sheet material , albeit at lower strength . 
Fabricating a magnesium alloy using wire-and-arc-based additive manufacturing was successfully conducted . 
Suitable processing conditions for realizing a solid structure with few weld defects were clarified . 
Fabricated object has sufficient tensile strength compared with the bulk material . 
Microstructure at the boundary between the substrate and the fabricated object is finer than that on the top layer . 
Material properties , such as porosity , tensile strength , and microstructure , of magnesium-alloy components fabricated using wire-and-arc-based additive-manufacturing techniques , which essentially represent a form of arc-welding technology have been examined . 
In the proposed method , the wire material is melted by arc discharge , and the molten metal is subsequently solidified and accumulated . 
Magnesium wire developed in this study facilitated fabrication of magnesium-alloy components using the said additive-manufacturing process . 
Subsequently , combinations of fabrication conditions , such as the welding current , torch feed speed , and cross feed of the torch , were explored , and suitable conditions for realizing a solid structure with fewer weld defects compared to those observed when using die-casting and other manufacturing methods , were determined . 
Tensile tests and microstructure observations were also performed to elucidate mechanical properties of magnesium alloy components fabricated via the said wire-and-arc-based technique . 
It was demonstrated that the fabricated object possesses sufficient tensile strength compared to the observed standard value of the bulk material . 
Furthermore , results from microstructure observations demonstrated that the higher the torch feed speed , the finer is the microstructure . 
Moreover , the observed microstructure at the boundary between the substrate and fabricated object was finer compared to that at the top layer . 
WAAM ( Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing ) is a metal AM ( Additive Manufacturing ) technology that allows high deposition rates and the manufacturability of very large components , compared to other AM technologies . 
Distortions and residual stresses affecting the manufactured parts represent the main drawbacks of this AM technique . 
FE ( Finite Element ) modeling could represent an effective tool to tackle such issues , since it can be used to optimize process parameters , deposition paths and to test alternative mitigation strategies . 
Nevertheless , specific modeling strategies are needed to reduce the computational cost of the process simulation , such as reducing the number of elements used in discretizing the model . 
The proposed technique is based on dividing the substrate in several zones , separately discretized and then connected by means of a double sided contact algorithm . 
This strategy allows to achieve a significant reduction of the number of elements required , without affecting their quality parameters . 
The geometry and dimension of the mesh zones are identified through a dedicated algorithm that allows to achieve an accurate temperature prediction with the minimum element number . 
The effectiveness of the proposed technique was tested by means of both numerical and experimental validation tests . 
AlCoFeNiSmTiV based new high entropy alloys were designed and fabricated using additive manufacturing technique . 
Elevated temperature corrosion performance of these alloys were studied . 
Phase analysis results indicated the presence of a single FCC phase in these HEAs after enduring corrosive atmospheres . 
High entropy alloys have attracted great interest due to their great stability and exceptional mechanical properties . 
Due to growing demand of novel engineering materials , which can endure harsh corrosive atmospheres , HEAs have been studied extensively to meet the demands of challenging industrial environments . 
Current manufacturing techniques of HEAs include arc-melting or spark plasma sintering , which are limited by factors such as high energy , grain refinement , alloying , and size limitations . 
In this study we report elevated temperature corrosion behavior of two new HEAs AlCoFeNiTiV0.9Sm0.1 and AlCoFeNiV0.9Sm0.1 , produced by laser-based additive manufacturing , which offers high freedom of design , fast prototyping , and rapid quenching rates that are ideal for many industrial applications . 
These alloys were tested in corrosive syngas atmosphere at elevated temperatures to explore their applicability in such harsh environments . 
Phase analysis results indicated the presence of a single FCC phase in these HEAs with no major surface cracks after enduring such corrosive atmospheres . 
These alloys exhibited good corrosion resistance as revealed by electrochemical testing methods . 
CALPHAD and DFT simulations were also performed to reveal the phase stability and crystal structures to further corroborate our experimental results . 
Wire and arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) is an additive manufacturing ( AM ) technology that uses wire-form materials and arc discharges as the energy source . 
AM techniques can fabricate complicated shapes that can not be obtained via conventional processing . 
Building lattice structures inside components enables weight reduction while maintaining high strength . 
Strut shapes must be constructed to form these lattice structures using WAAM . 
For fabricating strut shapes with high accuracy , the process parameters should be optimized . 
However , the relationship between layer geometry and process parameters is not clear . 
Therefore , in this study , struts were fabricated under various process conditions to investigate the influences of process parameters on the built object geometry . 
The results showed that fabrication of strut shapes depends on the heat input condition . 
Moreover , it was found that the arc discharge time had the highest influence on the layer height and diameter . 
The inclination angle of an overhanging shape had little influence on the dimensional accuracy of the built object . 
In addition , computer-aided manufacturing ( CAM ) system was developed for the fabrication of lattice structures , and the lattice structures were successfully built using WAAM . 
The build accuracy was measured using an x-ray computed tomography ( CT ) scanner ; the deviation in the structures designed using the CAM system and the actual fabricated structures measured using the CT scanner was lower than approximately ±2.3 mm . 
The integration of coaxial connectors into the filter and waveguide designs via 3D printing eliminates the need for two additional bulky external SMA-to-waveguide transitions , and allows for customizable integrated SMA-to-waveguide transitions that minimize impedance mismatch . 
Four designs , including air-filled and polycarbonate ( PC ) dielectric-filled waveguides and two-pole filters , are modeled and manufactured using additive manufacturing to demonstrate this integrative approach . 
PC dielectric posts are also incorporated into the device to provide additional reinforcement to the coaxial connectors without impacting the radio frequency ( RF ) performance . 
This paper discusses the topology optimization and additive manufacturing ( AM ) specific re-design of a metallic C-frame as it is used in the riveting process in the automotive industry . 
The main objective of the optimization and re-design process is the reduction of the structural weight where special attention needs to be paid to the specific manufacturing process of powder bed fusion which is a powder based layerwise additive manufacturing process . 
The initial optimization and AM specific re-design are performed under consideration of a number of free parameters that drive the performance and weight of the C-frame , and several generated solutions are compared under special consideration of the weight , the mechanical performance and the general manufacturability using powder bed fusion . 
The selected optimized solution then undergoes a final detailed re-design which focusses on given manufacturing restrictions . 
The mechanical performance of the optimized C-frame is assessed employing detailed finite element simulations by evaluating the stress and deformation state . 
The general manufacturability of the optimized part by powder bed fusion is demonstrated by the manufacturing of a scaled prototype . 
In order to enable a comparison of the new AM solution with a classical manufacturing process , an optimized C-frame geared towards classical milling is established as well . 
Both solutions are compared concerning weight , mechanical performance , manufacturability and economic aspects , and it can be shown that the AM solution offers a number of advantages that can not be exploited when employing classical means of manufacturing . 
This paper may serve as an introduction to the rather complex field of AM design of load bearing structures and is an illustrated case study thereof which can be of use for engineers working in this specific field that is still the topic of global academic and industrial research . 
Multifunctional lattice materials exhibit functionalities beyond conventional load-bearing usage and are usually fabricated by additive manufacturing . 
This work introduces a new class of functional lattice materials called liquid metal lattice materials . 
These lattice materials consist of liquid metals and elastomers organized in a core-shell manner . 
This hybrid design induces a shape memory effect by harnessing the solid-liquid phase transition of liquid metals . 
Consequently , several remarkable functionalities are achieved such as recoverable energy absorption , tunable rigidity , and reconfigurable behaviors . 
These liquid metal lattice materials are fabricated by using a hybrid manufacturing approach , which integrates the 3D printing , vacuum casting , and conformal coating techniques . 
A variety of lattice structures are presented to demonstrate the capability of this hybrid manufacturing method and the functionalities of liquid metal lattice materials . 
This new class of lattice materials have promising applications in aerospace , robotics , tunable metamaterials , etc . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) of tungsten carbide-cobalt ( WC-Co ) is explored starting with WC preforms shaped with binder jet additive manufacturing ( BJAM ) followed by melt infiltration of Co . 
The research objective is to demonstrate the ability to net-shape WC-Co composites through BJAM of a WC preform followed by backfilling with cobalt via pressureless infiltration . 
This method also has the potential to minimize shrinkage and grain growth compared to other AM techniques . 
The effects of sintering , Co content , and infiltration time on the net shaping and properties of processed composites are shown . 
The best shaped material had an average grain size of 5.1 μm , 32 vol. 
% Co , density of 98.54 % theoretical , fracture toughness of 23.2 MPa m1/2 , and hardness of 9.0 GPa . 
Data presented illustrates that the proposed approach results in favorable ceramic-metal ( cermet ) properties and is viable for fabricating cermets of other material combinations . 
Successful AM of cermets provides complex geometries , high throughout , and low costs . 
Online nondestructive testing for quality control is a critical direction for research in additive manufacturing in the future . 
In this study , for the first time , optical emission spectroscopy was employed to probe the arc characteristics in the wire arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) of an Al alloy and to detect its structural features . 
The arc characteristics , such as spectral intensity , electron density , and electron temperature , were calculated based on the atomic emission spectral lines . 
The resulting structural features of the deposited layers , namely the forming width , composition , grain size , and porosity defects , were analyzed , and a correlation between the arc characteristics and the structural features was proposed . 
The arc cathode size , which changed with the number of deposited layers , controlled the arc energy distribution . 
Hence , the forming width had an approximately linear relation with the spectral intensity of Mg ( a constituent of the alloy used for the wire feed ) and the electron density . 
The porosity in the alloy was observed to be caused by H , which was a dominant pollutant in the process . 
Furthermore , the correlation between the porosity and H spectral intensity was observed to be approximately linear . 
However , no significant correlation between the grain size and the spectrum was noticeable . 
The results from this study establish the applicability of spectral diagnosis of the forming size and the porosity in WAAM . 
Specification and analysis of the system structure and components of a desktop additive manufacturing ( AM ) system . 
Physical modeling of the energy consumption behavior of the desktop AM system using function-oriented bond graph . 
Development of an energy simulation tool for the desktop AM system using MATLAB®/Simulink® platform . 
Experimental validation of the simulation accuracy of the developed simulation approach . 
The assessment and minimization of energy consumptions of additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes are currently emerging research tasks . 
It is evident that the energy consumption of an AM process can be one or two orders of magnitude higher than conventional manufacturing processes . 
For improving the sustainability performance of AM , the energy use of AM should be evaluated and optimized in the design phase for planning products and AM processes . 
In order to support the quantification and evaluation of the energy consumption of AM , we have developed an energy simulation of a desktop AM system by using a physical modeling approach . 
Moreover , experiments have been carried out to validate and confirm the simulation accuracy and reliability . 
The result of the experimental validation has shown that the accuracy of the developed simulation approach can be up to approximately 98 % . 
Metal additive manufacturing is moving from rapid prototyping to on-demand manufacturing and even to serial production . 
Consistent part quality and development of a wider range of available materials are key for wider adoption . 
This requires control and optimization of various laser and scanning parameters . 
Therefore , process modeling has been extensively pursued to reduce experimental runs in the search for parameters that produce dense , high-quality parts for the given alloy . 
However , these optimal parameters remain machine-specific if conditions defined by the machine architecture are not considered . 
Previous studies have shown that shielding gas flow is one such parameter that affects porosity and mechanical properties of parts produced with laser powder bed fusion . 
In this study , the effect of shielding gas flow velocity on porosity and melt pool geometry in laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing is studied . 
As the vapor plume , and how effectively it is removed by the shielding gas flow , have a significant effect on the melt pool geometry in laser powder bed fusion , models aiming at predicting the melt pool geometry and attempts to transfer process parameters from one machine to another should consider the effect of the shielding gas flow . 
Nickel Aluminum Bronze square bars were printed via wire-arc additive manufacturing . 
Formation of various κ-phases were discussed and compared with cast alloy . 
Additive Manufactured ( AM ) alloy has fine solidification structure . 
AM-NAB exhibited superior tensile properties than the cast-NAB . 
As a step forward toward the development of the next generation of nickel aluminum bronze ( NAB ) components using wire-arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) , square bars were printed in the vertical direction . 
The as-built microstructure was characterized using multi-scale electron microscopy techniques , where the differences in phase formation were compared to the reference cast-NAB based on the solidification characteristics . 
The as-cast microstructure typically consists of Cu-rich α-matrix , and four types of intermetallic particles referred to as κ-phases . 
In the WAAM-NAB , the formation of κI was suppressed due to high cooling rates . 
The microstructure was finer and the volume fraction of intermetallic particles was significantly lower than that of the cast-NAB . 
Based on energy dispersive spectroscopy ( EDS ) technique and diffraction pattern analysis using transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , the phases formed in the interdendritic regions were identified as κII ( globular Fe3Al ) and κIII ( lamellar NiAl ) , whereas numerous fine ( 5–10 nm ) Fe-rich κIV particles were precipitated uniformly within the α-matrix . 
Electron backscatter diffraction analysis revealed weak texture on both parallel and perpendicular planes to the building direction with ( 100 ) poles rotated away from the build direction . 
The WAAM-NAB sample exhibited considerably higher yield strength ( ˜88 MPa ) and elongation ( ˜10 % ) than the cast-NAB , but the gain in the ultimate tensile strength was marginal . 
Processing of Inconel 718 and copper alloy GRCop-84 as a bimetallic structure using laser engineered net shaping ( LENS ) . 
A compositionally gradient layer with high laser energy input helped to process these bimetallic structures . 
The bimetallic structure resulted in high thermal diffusivity as compared to pure Inconel 718 . 
Deposition of GRCop-84 Increased the thermal diffusivity of Inconel 718 by ∼250 % . 
To understand processing ability and measure resultant interfacial and thermal properties of Inconel 718 and copper alloy GRCop-84 , bimetallic structures were fabricated using laser engineering net shaping ( LENS™ ) , a commercially available additive manufacturing technique . 
It was hypothesized that additively combining the two aerospace alloys would form a unique bimetallic structure with improved thermophysical properties compared to the Inconel 718 alloy . 
Two approaches were used : the direct deposition of GRCop-84 on Inconel 718 and the compositional gradation of the two alloys . 
Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , energy dispersive spectroscopy ( EDS ) , X-ray Diffraction ( XRD ) , Vickers microhardness and flash thermal diffusivity were used to characterize these bimetallic structures to validate our hypothesis . 
The compositional gradation approach showed a gradual transition of Inconel 718 and GRCop-84 elements at the interface , which was also reflected in the cross-sectional hardness profile across the bimetallic interface . 
SEM images showed columnar grain structures at the interfaces with Cr2Nb precipitate accumulation along grain boundaries and the substrate-deposit interface . 
The average thermal diffusivity of the bimetallic structure was measured at 11.33 mm2/s for the temperature range of 50 °C–300 °C ; a 250 % increase in diffusivity when compared to the pure Inconel 718 alloy at 3.20 mm2/s . 
Conductivity of the bimetallic structures increased by almost 300 % compared to Inconel 718 as well . 
Such structures with designed compositional gradation and tailored thermal properties opens up the possibilities of multi-material metal additive manufacturing for next generation of aerospace structures . 
Depth-sensing ( instrumented ) indentation testing technique is a robust , reliable , convenient and non-destructive characterization method to study small-scale mechanical properties and rate-dependent plastic deformation in metals and alloys at ambient and elevated temperatures . 
In the present paper , depth-sensing indentation creep behavior of an additively manufactured , via laser powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) method , Ti-6Al-4V alloy is studied at ambient temperature . 
Indentation creep tests were performed through a dual-stage scheme ( loading followed by a constant load-holding and unloading ) at different peak loads of 250 mN , 350 mN , and 450 mN with holding time of 400 s. Creep parameters including creep rate , creep stress exponent , and indentation size effect were analyzed , according to the Oliver and Pharr method , at different additive manufacturing scan directions and scan sizes . 
To assess processing parameter/ microstructure/ creep property correlations in the additively manufacture Ti-6Al-4V alloy , microstructural quantitative analyses ( i.e . 
optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy ) were performed as well . 
The findings of this study , according to stress exponent values , showed that the controlling mechanism of the creep at ambient temperature for the examined L-PBF Ti-6Al-4V is mainly glide-controlled dislocation creep . 
These findings were compared against traditionally processed Ti-6Al-4V as well . 
Additively manufactured , short fiber reinforced polymer composites have advantages over traditional continuous fiber composites , which include low cost and design flexibility . 
However , these composites suffer from low strength and stiffness as compared to their continuous fiber counterparts due to the limitation of low fiber volume . 
This direct write additive manufacturing technique allowed us to fabricate short fiber reinforced thermoset composites in intricate geometries , with unprecedented high compression strength ( 673 MPa ) , flexural strength ( 401 MPa ) , flexural stiffness ( 53 GPa ) , and fiber volume ratio ( 46 % ) . 
Milled carbon fibers were used as the reinforcing fibers , which were considered too short to have the ability to enhance the mechanical strength of composites . 
However , in this study we show for the first time that milled carbon fibers have the ability to significantly reinforce the thermoset matrix and the composites reinforced with these fibers achieve mechanical performances similar to those of composites reinforced with longer fibers . 
We believe that a transformation takes place at high fiber volumes on the load transport mechanism within the composites , leading to higher levels of strength and a stiffness enhancement . 
This pseudo transformation can give rise to short fibers that act as if they are longer , which aids in the effective transfer of tensile loads from the matrix phase to the fibers . 
This study also showed that the mechanical properties of the additively fabricated thermoset composites match those of ubiquitous , denser structural metals , and these properties show nearly isotropic behavior . 
Therefore , these systems have great potential to find immediate applications where weight reduction and component complexity are both desired . 
Lattice structures are excellent candidates for lightweight , energy absorbing applications such as personal protective equipment . 
In this paper we explore several important aspects of lattice design and production by metal additive manufacturing , including the choice of cell size and the application of a post-manufacture heat treatment . 
Key results include the characterisation of several failure modes in double gyroid lattices made of Al-Si10-Mg , the elimination of brittle fracture and low-strain failure by the application of a heat treatment , and the calculation of specific energy absorption under compressive deformation ( 16 × 106 J m−3 up to 50 % strain ) . 
These results demonstrate the suitability of double gyroid lattices for energy absorbing applications , and will enable the design and manufacture of more efficient lightweight parts in the future . 
Minimizing the residual stress build-up in metal-based additive manufacturing plays a pivotal role in selecting a particular material and technique for making an industrial part . 
In beam-based additive manufacturing , although a great deal of effort has been made to minimize the residual stresses , it is still elusive how to do so by simply optimizing the manufacturing parameters , such as beam size , beam power , and scan speed . 
With reference to the Ti6Al4V alloy and manufacturing by electron beam melting , we perform systematic finite element modeling of one-pass scanning to study the effects of beam size , beam power density , beam scan speed , and chamber bed temperature on the magnitude and distribution of residual stresses . 
Our study elucidates both qualitative and quantitative features of the residual stress fields originated by these manufacturing parameters . 
Our findings can serve as useful guidelines for engineers and designers to deal with residual stress build-up during additive manufacturing of Ti6Al4V . 
LCAs of ten 3D printers were compared in different temporal & spatial utilizations . 
Utilization alone is not enough ; energy use and print materials are also critical . 
Previous studies on the environmental impacts of polymeric additive manufacturing ( AM ) have shown that higher printer utilization dramatically improves impacts per part—so much so that it might dominate all other interventions if taken to an extreme . 
In this study , life cycle assessments ( LCAs ) were performed for an inkjet fusion printer with exceptionally high spatial utilization capacity and were compared to previous LCAs of nine printers printing with eight materials . 
Comparisons were performed in different utilizations , both temporal and spatial , to determine if high utilization reduces the environmental impact of AM more than other interventions , such as using sustainable print materials . 
For the inkjet fusion printer , maximum utilization dramatically reduced the environmental impact per part to less than 1 % of its impact in lowest utilization ; this was below the impacts of other printers in low utilizations . 
However , when compared in the same utilization scenarios , the inkjet fusion printer still caused a higher environmental impact per part than almost all printers , primarily due to high energy use . 
The lowest-impact printer used both high spatial utilization and low-impact materials that also enabled a low-energy printing process . 
Therefore , printer utilization is not the overriding factor and must be combined with energy efficiency and material choice . 
Ultrasonic cavitation abrasive finishing reduced Ra on metal additively manufactured sloping and side surfaces by up to 40 % . 
No excessive removal occurs in UCAF as mass and dimensional changes induced by UCAF are dependent on the initial surface morphology . 
Internal surfaces of a 3 mm diameter channel were finished to less than 4 μm Ra . 
Moderate abrasive size and concentration led to a balance between the two mechanisms of surface roughness improvement . 
The poor and non-uniform surface quality of parts produced by powder bed fusion ( PBF ) processes remains a huge limitation in additive manufacturing . 
Here we show that ultrasonic cavitation abrasive finishing ( UCAF ) could improve the surface integrity of PBF surfaces built at various orientations –0° , 45° and 90° . 
Average surface roughness , Ra , was reduced from as high as 6.5 μm on side surfaces ( 90° ) to 3.8 μm . 
Surface morphological observations showed extensive removals of surface irregularities and peak reduction on sloping ( 45° ) and side surfaces . 
The micro-hardness of the first 100 μm of the surface layer was enhanced up to 15 % post-UCAF . 
A parametric study further showed the effect of abrasive size , abrasive concentration , ultrasonic amplitude and working gap on UCAF ’ s performance . 
A moderate abrasive size at 12.5 μm and concentration level at 5 wt % resulted in the lowest final Ra ; as the two dominant material removal mechanisms – direct cavitation erosion and micro-abrasive impacts – were balanced . 
Finally , UCAF was demonstrated to result in 20 % Ra improvement of internal surfaces of a 3 mm diameter channel . 
Microstructure of an additively manufactured AlSi10Mg through direct metal laser sintering ( DMLS ) process is studied using multi-scale characterization techniques including scanning electron microscopy , electron backscatter diffraction , and transmission electron microscopy . 
The microstructure of DMLS-AlSi10Mg consists of hierarchical characteristics , spanning three order of magnitude , where nanometer sized to sub-millimeter scaled features exist in the structure . 
These characteristics included grain and cell structures , nanoscale Si precipitates and pre-existing dislocation networks . 
Dynamic mechanical behavior of the material is studied using a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar apparatus over a range of strain rates varying between 800 s−1 and 3200 s−1 . 
Investigation of the deformed microstructures reveals the role of hierarchical microstructure on the dynamic behavior of the material . 
The high strain-rate deformation is accommodated by dynamic recovery ( DRV ) process , where low angle grain boundaries evolve due to the generation of dislocations , evolution of dislocation networks , and annihilation of dislocations . 
Both cell walls and Si precipitates contribute to impeding the dislocation motion and development of dislocation networks . 
At high strain rates , dislocation networks evolve in the nanoscale DRVed subgrains . 
Metal additive manufacturing ( AM ) is a rapidly growing field aimed to produce high-performance net-shaped parts . 
Therefore , bulk metallic glasses ( BMGs ) , known for their superlative mechanical properties , are of remarkable interest for integration with AM technology . 
In this study , we pioneer the utilization of commercially available BMG sheetmetal as feedstock for AM , using laser foil printing ( LFP ) technology . 
LFP and traditional casting were used to produce samples for four-point bending and Vickers hardness measurements to rigorously compare the mechanical performance of samples resulting from these two fabrication techniques . 
Through LFP , fully amorphous BMG samples with dimensions larger than the critical casting thickness of the same master alloy were successfully made , while exhibiting high yield strength and toughness in bending . 
This work exemplifies a potential method to fabricate high-value BMG commercial parts , like gears or mechanisms , where the parts are conventionally machined after printing , and greatly benefit from utilizing novel materials . 
In industry , Design for Additive Manufacturing ( DfAM ) is currently synonymous with expert knowledge and external consultants for many companies . 
Particularly in higher cost technologies , such as metal powder bed fusion , component design requires extensive additive manufacturing ( AM ) knowledge . 
If a part is improperly designed , then it can cause thousands of dollars of lost time and material through a failed print . 
To avoid this situation , specialists must be consulted throughout the printing process ; however , the shortage of trained personnel familiar with AM can create a bottleneck during design . 
In order to help businesses identify candidate parts for Powder Bed Fusion ( PBF ) AM , this paper presents a DfAM worksheet to help engineers , drafters , and designers select good part candidates with little prior knowledge of the specific technology . 
This worksheet uses data from the literature to support the values used for design guidance . 
Example components are shown to demonstrate the worksheet process . 
Ratings of these components are then compared with expert raters ’ assessments of their suitability for fabrication with PBF from a geometric standpoint . 
In recent years , combining additive and subtractive manufacturing technologies has attracted much attention from both industrial and academic sectors . 
Thereafter , the design of process planning for combining additive and subtractive manufacturing processes is focused . 
This allows achieving the geometry and quality of final part from the existing part . 
The methodology for process planning design is developed in two major steps using the manufacturing feature concept , the knowledge of manufacturing processes , technological requirements , and available resources . 
In the first step , manufacturing features ( i.e . 
machining and additive manufacturing features ) are extracted from the information of the existing and final parts . 
In the second step , the process planning is generated from extracted features by respecting the relationships of features and the manufacturing precedence constraints . 
Finally , a case study is used to illustrate the proposed methodology . 
Although vibration-assisted powder delivery systems have been developed and studied in the literature , their characteristics and principles of operation are generally not well suited for powder-based additive manufacturing operations mainly because of their powder flows and deposition characteristics . 
The flow rate , one of the key parameters in these processes , was used to evaluate the system . 
Its sensitivity and dependence on powder particle size , piezo excitation frequency and amplitude , hopper volume , nozzle size , and humidity were assessed . 
The results , using 316 L stainless steel powders , have shown that the mass powder flow rate can be effectively controlled and that it is most prominently influenced by the piezo excitation frequency . 
Ti6Al4V + Al12Si compositionally graded cylindrical structures were fabricated on a Ti6Al4V substrate using laser engineered net shaping ( LENS™ ) process . 
LENS™ fabricated materials had two regions of Ti6Al4V + Al12Si compositions , a pure Al12Si , and a pure Ti6Al4V area . 
Microstructural changes were affected by both laser power and compositional variations . 
In addition , TiSi2 and Ti3Al phase formations were also identified in low and high laser power processed Ti6Al4V + Al12Si sections , respectively . 
Moreover , the high laser power processed Ti6Al4V + Al12Si section showed the highest hardness value of 685.6 ± 10.6 HV0.1 , which was caused due to the formation of new intermetallic phases . 
This high hardness section exhibited brittle failure modes during compression tests , while the pure Al12Si sections showed ductile deformation . 
The maximum compressive strengths of Ti6Al4V + Al12Si compositionally graded material was 507.8 ± 52.0 MPa . 
Our results show that compositionally gradient bulk structures of Ti6Al4V and Al12Si can be directly manufactured using additive manufacturing , however , performances can vary significantly based on process parameters and compositional variations . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) enables highly complex-shaped and functionally optimized parts . 
However , as today ’ s computer-aided design ( CAD ) tools are still based on low-level , geometric primitives , the modeling of complex geometries requires many repetitive , manual steps . 
As a consequence , the need for an automated design approach is emphasized and regarded as a key enabler to quickly create different concepts , allow iterative design changes , and customize parts at reduced effort . 
Topology optimization exists as a computational design approach but usually demands a manual interpretation and redesign of a CAD model and may not be applicable to problems such as the design of parts with multiple integrated flows . 
This work presents a computational design synthesis framework to automate the design of complex-shaped multi-flow nozzles . 
The framework provides AM users a toolbox with design elements , which are used as building blocks to generate finished 3D part geometries . 
The elements are organized in a hierarchical architecture and implemented using object-oriented programming . 
As the layout of the elements is defined with a visual interface , the process is accessible to non-experts . 
As a proof of concept , the framework is applied to successfully generate a variety of customized AM nozzles that are tested using co-extrusion of clay . 
Finally , the work discusses the framework ’ s benefits and limitations , the impact on product development and novel AM applications , and the transferability to other domains . 
17-4PH stainless steel thin-walled samples were additively manufactured by SLM Samples parallel and at 45˚ to the scan axes gave beam path lengths of 19 - 0.8 mm Longer beam paths gave microstructures comprising mostly coarse-grained ferrite The shortest beam paths gave structures with mostly austenite and some martensite Re-heating of ferrite leads to austenite , with martensite forming during cooling Components with varying dimensions are found in numerous applications . 
The current work examines how microstructures and phases change for additively manufactured 17-4PH thin walls as a function of laser path length , path direction , and wall thickness . 
Two sample sets were designed , each consisting of four walls with thicknesses of 6.4 mm to 0.8 mm . 
In the first set , the wall axes were parallel to the scan axes , such that the laser path length varied from layer to layer with the laser path either being parallel or perpendicular to the wall . 
In the second set , the walls lay at 45° to the scan axes , such that the laser path had the same length in all layers and gradually decreased with wall thickness . 
Substantial changes in phase stability and microstructure are observed as the wall thickness decreases , with ferritic phases and coarse grains changing to fine grains and an increasing volume fraction of austenite . 
These changes are attributed to changes in the local temperature-time profile as the length of the laser paths change from 19 mm to 0.8 mm . 
These observations demonstrate the range of microstructure and phase control options available in additive manufacturing with judicious selections of part layouts on build plates and of laser beam directions . 
In this paper , the anisotropy in the nickel-aluminum bronze ( NAB ) component manufactured by WAAM process has been shown and investigated by different methods including material and mechanical tests . 
The quenching and tempering heat treatments have been used in this paper to reduce the anisotropy . 
Results have indicated that the quenching and tempering heat treatments can effectively reduce the anisotropy in the NAB component . 
Results have shown that the additively manufactured materials possess relatively better tensile performances . 
In this paper , a nickel-aluminum bronze alloy component is built using wire-arc additive manufacturing process . 
In order to investigate the influence of anisotropy introduced by the wire-arc additive manufacturing process , the layer-by-layer manufactured components with different post-production heat treatments are characterized by optical and scanning electron microscopy morphologies , X-ray diffraction and mechanical tests in longitudinal , transverse and normal directions . 
Also , the ductility of the alloy is significantly improved with the designed quenching and tempering method , and competitive mechanical properties are achieved when tempering temperature reaches 650 °C . 
In addition , the anisotropy in the additively manufactured alloy can be effectively modified by the quenching and tempering heat treatments . 
Selective laser sintering ( SLS ) is one of the most popular industrial polymer additive manufacturing processes with applications in aerospace , biomedical , tooling , prototyping , and beyond . 
SLS is capable of creating unique , functional parts with little waste and no tooling by using a high-powered laser to selectively melt powdered polymer into desired shapes . 
This process relies heavily on understanding and controlling the thermodynamics of the polymer melt process . 
One of the biggest challenges SLS faces is lack of adequate process control , which leads to comparatively high component variations . 
It has been shown that implementing more advanced laser control techniques enable a higher level of control over the processing temperatures and lead to more uniform components . 
Currently , there are no commercial options for a laser power controller that allows continuously variable power to be used as a galvanometer system adjusts the laser position . 
Process consistency and control are bottleneck issues to wider insertion of powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing in the industrial shopfloor . 
Of particular interest is the porosity of the components , which remains the limiting factor to high-cycle fatigue performance . 
Recent experiments have shown that , with increasing energy density , a surge in porosity is seen in selectively laser melted metals . 
In this high-energy density regime , porosity must originate from mechanisms that are different from the well-known incomplete melting in the low energy density regime . 
To shed light on this interesting phenomenon , this paper first discusses the mechanism of bubble formation in the melt pool and possible trapping during the solidification , and then formulates a predictive model for porosity in this regime . 
To compare with experimental results , we perform computer modeling and simulations which have been fully validated by experiments to determine the parameters in the model . 
We show that the model predictions are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental measurements . 
Hence , the proposed model can be used as a tool to predict the porosity , and further to control and possibly reduce porosity in laser powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing , paving the way for its wider adoption in manufacturing shopfloors . 
Laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) uses a focused , high power laser to repeatedly scan geometric patterns on thin layers of metal powder , which build up to a final , solid three-dimensional ( 3D ) part . 
This process is somewhat limited in that the parts tend to have poorer surface finish ( compared to machining or grinding ) and distortion due to residual stress , as well as multiple other deficiencies . 
Typical laser scan strategies are relatively simple and use constant laser power levels . 
This elicits local variations in the melt pool size , shape , or temperature , particularly near sharp geometric features or overhang structures due to the relatively higher thermal conductivity of solid metal compared to metal powder . 
In this paper , we present a new laser power control algorithm , which scales the laser power to a value called the geometric conductance factor ( GCF ) . 
The GCF is calculated based on the amount of solid vs. powder material near the melt pool . 
Then , we detail the hardware and software implementation on the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) additive manufacturing metrology testbed ( AMMT ) , which includes co-axial melt pool monitoring using a high-speed camera . 
Six parts were fabricated out of nickel superalloy 625 ( IN625 ) with the same nominal laser power , but with varying GCF algorithm parameters . 
We demonstrate the effect of tailored laser power on reducing the variability of melt pool intensity measured throughout the 3D build . 
Finally , we contrast the difference between the ‘ optimized ’ part vs. the standard build parameters , including the deflection of the final part top surface near the overhang and the variation of surface finish on the down-facing surfaces . 
Ultimately , the improvements to the in-situ process monitoring and part qualities demonstrate the utility and future potential tuning and optimizing more complex laser scan strategies . 
Powder-fed laser additive manufacturing ( LAM ) based on directed energy deposition ( DED ) technology is used to produce S316-L austenitic , and S410-L martensitic stainless steel structures by 3D-printing through a layer-upon-layer fashion . 
The microstructural features and crystallographic textural components are studied via electron backscattering diffraction ( EBSD ) analysis , hardness indentation and tensile testing . 
The results are compared with commercial rolled sheets of austenitic and martensitic stainless steels . 
A well-developed < 200 > direction solidification texture ( with a J-index of ∼11.5 ) is observed for the austenitic structure produced by the LAM process , compared to a J-index of ∼2.0 for the commercial austenitic rolled sheet . 
Such a texture in the LAM process is caused by equiaxed grain formation in the middle of each layer followed by columnar growth during layer-upon-layer deposition . 
A quite strong preferred orientation ( J-index of 17.5 ) is noticed for martensitic steel developed by LAM . 
Large laths of martensite exhibit a dominant textural component of { 011 } < 111 > in the α-phase , which is mainly controlled by transformation during layer-by-layer deposition . 
On the other hand , the martensitic commercial sheet consists of equiaxed grains without any preferred orientation or completely random orientations . 
In the case of the austenitic steel , mechanical properties such as tensile strength , hardness and ductility were severely deteriorated during the LAM deposition . 
A ductility loss of about 50 % is recorded compared to the commercially rolled sheets that is attributed to the cast/solidified structure . 
However , LAM manufacturing of martensitic stainless steel structures leads to a considerably enhanced mechanical strength ( more than double ) at the expense of reduced ductility , because of martensitic phase transformations under higher cooling rates . 
Electrophoretic deposition ( EPD ) is a widely used industrial coating technique for depositing polymer , ceramic , and metal thin films . 
Recently , there has been interested in using EPD for additive manufacturing using reconfigurable electrodes . 
We demonstrate a resolution limit of 10 μm for the deposited feature , which corresponds to the limits of the optical system . 
Furthermore , the first 3D overhanging structure made with EPD is presented , which points to the ability to create architected cellular materials . 
These improvements open the possibility for EPD to be a true 3D additive manufacturing technique .

Data quantify dependence of enhancement on annealing time and temperature . 
Develops a theoretical thermal model , with good agreement with measurements . 
Results may help improve thermal performance of polymer AM parts . 
While additive manufacturing offers significant advantages compared to traditional manufacturing technologies , deterioration in thermal and mechanical properties compared to properties of the underlying materials is a serious concern . 
In the context of polymer extrusion based additive manufacturing , post-process approaches , such as thermal annealing have been reported for improving mechanical properties based on reptation of polymer chains and enhanced filament-to-filament adhesion . 
However , there is a lack of similar work for improving thermal properties such as thermal conductivity . 
This paper reports significant enhancement in build-direction thermal conductivity of polymer extrusion based parts as a result of thermal annealing . 
A theoretical model based on Arrhenius kinetics for neck growth and a heat transfer model for the consequent impact on inter-layer thermal contact resistance is developed . 
Predicted thermal conductivity enhancement is found to be in good agreement with experimental data for a wide range of annealing temperature and time . 
The theoretical model may play a key role in developing practical thermal annealing strategies that account for the multiple constraints involved in annealing of polymer parts . 
This work may facilitate the use of polymer extrusion additive manufacturing for producing enhanced thermal conductivity parts capable of withstanding thermal loads . 
Additively manufactured metamaterials such as lattices offer unique physical properties such as high specific strengths and stiffnesses . 
However , additively manufactured parts , including lattices , exhibit a higher variability in their mechanical properties than wrought materials , placing more stringent demands on inspection , part quality verification , and product qualification . 
Previous research on anomaly detection has primarily focused on using in-situ monitoring of the additive manufacturing process or post-process ( ex-situ ) x-ray computed tomography . 
In this work , we show that convolutional neural networks ( CNN ) , a machine learning algorithm , can directly predict the energy required to compressively deform gyroid and octet truss metamaterials using only optical images . 
Using the tiled nature of engineered lattices , the relatively small data set ( 43 to 48 lattices ) can be augmented by systematically subdividing the original image into many smaller sub-images . 
During testing of the CNN , the prediction from these sub-images can be combined using an ensemble-like technique to predict the deformation work of the entire lattice . 
This approach provides a fast and inexpensive screening tool for predicting properties of 3D printed lattices . 
Importantly , this artificial intelligence strategy goes beyond ‘ inspection ’ , since it accurately estimates product performance metrics , not just the existence of defects . 
Plaster Binder Jetting ( BJ ) is one of the major Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) technologies which has been in use since the 1990s . 
It has many advantages such as the ability to print in full color CMY ( K ) , no support structures , and is relatively faster and less expensive when compared to other AM technologies . 
Since there is no phase transformation ( e.g . 
powder to molten pool in powder bed fusion , directed energy deposition ) , BJ does not require support structures and enables higher packing density in the build volume . 
However , relatively lower mechanical strength when compared to other AM processes has mostly limited it to non-functional applications such as prototyping . 
This paper investigates novel methods to improve the mechanical and temperature performance of plaster BJ additive manufactured parts via improved infiltration processes and incorporation of infiltrants with higher strength . 
Potential applications include functional end use products , including tooling , jigs and fixtures for higher temperature applications . 
Three 2-part epoxy resin systems were evaluated as infiltrants in comparison to epoxy and cyanoacrylate ( CA ) resins recommended by the original equipment manufacturer ( OEM ) . 
Multiple impregnation methods including hot and wet vacuum were evaluated on their infiltration effectiveness . 
The best impregnation method was then used to prepare tensile , flexural and compressive samples for additional evaluation of each resin . 
Both resins and infiltrated samples were individually evaluated using Differential Scanning Calorimetry ( DSC ) to determine glass transition temperatures and other thermal events . 
Infiltrated specimens of the best performing resins were evaluated for Heat Deflection Temperature ( HDT ) performance utilizing Dynamic Mechanical Analysis ( DMA ) . 
It was found that infiltration is anisotropic , with the higher penetration depth from the sides ( between layers ) than top and bottom ( across layers ) . 
Vacuum impregnation resulted in the highest infiltration depth by fully impregnating the 25 mm cubic samples . 
The best performing epoxy showed a 10 % increase in mechanical strength over the OEM epoxy at 76 % reduction in cost . 
The OEM cyanoacrylate had the lowest mechanical strength across all tests . 
DSC analysis revealed that the plaster and gypsum base material will start to dehydrate above 100 °C and will ultimately limit the parts ’ high temperature capabilities . 
The OEM epoxy showed the highest HDT . 
High residual stresses are typical in additively manufactured metals and can reach levels as high as the yield strength , leading to distortions and even cracks . 
Here , an in situ method for controlling residual stress during laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing was demonstrated . 
By illuminating the surface of a build with homogeneously intense , shaped light from a set of laser diodes , the thermal history was controlled thereby reducing the residual stress in as-built parts . 
316L stainless steel bridge-shaped parts were built to characterize the effect of in situ annealing on the residual stress . 
A reduction in the overall residual stress value of up to 90 % was realized without altering the as-built grain structure ( no grain growth ) . 
Some annealing effects on the cellular-dendritic solidification structure ( patterns of higher solute content ) occurred in areas that experienced prolonged exposure to elevated temperature . 
A comparison of the in situ process to conventional post-build annealing demonstrated equivalent stress reduction compared to rule-of-thumb thermal treatments . 
Use of this method could reduce or remove the need for post processing to remove residual stresses . 
Metallic cellular solids are a class of materials known for their high specific mechanical properties , being desirable in applications where a combination of high strength or stiffness and low density are important . 
These lightweight materials are often stochastic and manufactured by foaming or casting . 
If regular ( periodic ) lattice structures are desired , they may be manufactured by metallic additive manufacturing techniques . 
However , these have characteristic issues , such as un-melted powders , porosity and heterogeneous microstructures . 
This study reports a novel low-cost route for producing regular lattice structures by an additive manufacturing assisted investment casting technique . 
Fused filament fabrication is used to produce the lattice structure pattern which is infiltrated with plaster . 
The pattern is then burnt off and the aluminum is cast in vacuum . 
In this way we can manufacture non-stochastic metallic lattices having fine struts/ribs ( 0.6 mm cross-section using a 0.4 mm nozzle ) and relative densities down to 0.036 . 
X-ray micro computed tomography ( μCT ) showed that as-cast A356 Aluminium alloy frameworks have high dimensional tolerances and fine detail control . 
Frameworks based on units of six connected struts ranging from intruding ( auxetic ) to protruding ( hexagonal ) strut angles are studied . 
Vertical struts are finer than expected , reducing their moment of area which could impact their compressive strength . 
This new , low cost , route for producing high precision metallic cellular lattices offers an attractive alternative to other additive manufacturing techniques ( e.g . 
selective laser and electron beam melting ) . 
Fine equiaxed dendrites and discrete Laves phase were obtained using alow pulse frequency . 
Discrete distribution of δ-phase and high-density precipitation of γ″-Ni3Nb were obtained . 
A good combination of strength and ductility was obtained by optimizing the microstructures . 
Controlling of Nb-rich intermetallics is an important topic for laser additive manufacturing ( LAM ) of Inconel 718 . 
In the present work , a novel quasi-continuous-wave LAM ( QCW-LAM ) with different pulse frequencies is used to control the morphology , distribution and amount of Nb-rich phases of Inconel 718 . 
The results show that dispersively distributed Nb-rich Laves phases are produced by introducing equiaxed dendrites at a low pulse frequency while a high pulse frequency results in coarse and chain-like Laves phases . 
The samples featured by fine and discrete Laves phases show a good response to the post solution-aging treatment in which the dissolution of Laves-phase and subsequently discrete precipitations of δ-phase as well as high-density precipitation of γ″-Ni3Nb strengthening phase are promoted . 
Thus , a good combination of strength and ductility is achieved for the QCW-LAM fabricated Inconel 718 . 
This study shows a desired mechanical property can be obtained by synergistically optimizing the microstructures in which various Nb-rich phases are involved even though the formation of brittle Laves phases is hardly avoided during LAM of Inconel 718 . 
This paper discusses the effects of process parameters in TIG based WAAM for specimens created using Hastelloy X alloy ( Haynes International ) welding wire and 304 stainless-steel plate as the substrate . 
The Taguchi method and ANOVA were used to determine the effects of travel speed , wire feed rate , current , and argon flow rate on the responses including bead shape and size , bead roughness , oxidation levels , melt through depth , and the microstructure . 
Increasing travel speed or decreasing current caused a decrease in melt through depth and an increase in roughness . 
No observable interface between the layers was present suggesting a complete fusion between layers with no oxidation . 
The zones were characterized by the size and distribution of the molybdenum carbide formations within the matrix grain formations . 
Reactive-deposition additive manufacturing was employed to manufacture titanium-based metal matrix composites for improving the wear resistance and temperature capability of commercially pure titanium ( CPTi ) ; a standard material in the aerospace , biomedical , and marine industries , among others . 
Composites were manufactured by leveraging in situ high-temperature reactions between CPTi , zirconium ( Zr ) , and boron nitride ( BN ) powders during laser-based directed-energy-deposition ( DED ) 3D-printing . 
The effect of Zr and BN on the processability , phase formation ( s ) , surface wear , and mechanical properties of 3D-printed titanium was studied by printing commercially-pure titanium with premixed additions of 20 wt % Zr and 10 wt % BN using Laser Engineered Net Shaping ( LENS™ ) . 
In the as-printed BN-containing structures , phase analysis revealed reinforcing ceramic phases TiN , TiB , and TiB2 , whose presence was substantiated through first-principles analysis . 
The combined addition of Zr and BN produced a Ti-Zr alloy matrix with BN-particle and in situ phase-reinforced microstructure with 450 % higher hardness ( from 318 ± 26 HV0.1/15 to 1424 ± 361 HV0.5/15 ) , a stabilized sliding−COF within 50 m of reciprocating wear testing , and 9x lower final wear rate in comparison to LENS™ deposited titanium . 
Zr-addition alone revealed a combined alloyed and particle-reinforced composite with 12 % higher hardness , 23 % higher compressive yield strength , and an 11 % decrease in final wear rate compared to LENS™-produced titanium . 
Our results demonstrate that reactive-deposition based additive manufacturing can be exploited to create unique coatings and net-shape alloyed structures to enhance the surface and bulk properties of standard engineering materials such as titanium . 
We propose a simple method to construct a process map for additive manufacturing using a support vector machine . 
By observing the surface of the built parts and classifying them into two classes ( good or bad ) , this method enables a process map to be constructed in order to predict a process condition that is effective at fabricating a part with low pore density . 
This proposed method is demonstrated in a biomedical CoCr alloy system . 
This study also shows that the value of a decision function in a support vector machine has a physical meaning ( at least in the proposed method ) and is a semi-quantitative guideline for porosity density of parts fabricated by additive manufacturing . 
In binder jetting additive manufacturing ( BJAM ) , the part geometry is generated via a binding agent during printing and structural integrity is imparted during sintering at a later stage . 
This separation between shape generation and thermal processing allows the sintering process to be uniquely controlled and the final microstructural characteristics to be tailored . 
The separation between the printing and consolidation steps offers a unique opportunity to print responsive materials that are later “ activated ” by temperature and/or environment . 
This concept is preliminarily demonstrated using a foaming copper feedstock , such that the copper is printed , sintered and then foamed via intraparticle expansion in separate steps . 
The integration of foaming feedstock in BJAM could allow for creation of ultra-lightweight structures that offer hierarchical porosity , graded density , and/or tailored absorption properties . 
This work investigates processing protocol for copper foam structures to achieve the highest porosity . 
The copper feedstock was prepared by distributing copper oxides through the copper matrix via mechanical milling , and that powder was then printed into a green geometry through BJAM . 
The printed green parts were then heat treated using different thermal cycles to investigate the porosity evolution relative to various heating conditions . 
The heat treated parts were then examined for their resulting properties including porosity , microstructural evolution , and volumetric shrinkage . 
Parts that were initially sintered in air and then annealed in a hydrogen atmosphere led to higher porosity compared to those sintered in hydrogen alone . 
Anisotropy in linear shrinkage in X , Y , and Z direction was also observed in the heat treated parts with the largest linear shrinkage occurring in the Z direction . 
Additive manufacturing that allows layer by layer shaping of complex structures is of rapidly increasing interest in production technology . 
A particularly rapid prototyping technique of additive manufacturing is laser beam melting ( LBM ) . 
This 3D printing method is based on a powder bed fusion technique , using a high-powered laser to melt and consolidate metallic powders . 
The process needs a tightly controlled atmosphere of inert gas , which requires a confined space of a building chamber . 
This and more process related factors like elevated temperatures , laser radiation or the resulting light intensity caused by the melting of metals , make a closed-loop quality control very ambitious . 
In this paper , we propose a new in-process approach for quality control with high precision metrology based on structured light . 
The precise layer by layer dimensional measurement of both the printed part and the powder deposition , allows for process assessment in- or off-line . 
For laser powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) additive manufactured ( AM ) metals , residual stress-induced cracking often occurs at the interface between the solid and lattice support , and hence it is important to characterize the as-built critical J-integral of the interface to prevent cracking to occur . 
However , the standard testing method for the critical J-integral of the interface ( ASTM E1820-01 ) does not work well in this situation for four reasons : 1 ) standard test blocks consisting of half solid and half lattice support crack during the printing process ; 2 ) even after reinforcing the block with side walls to prevent cracking , post-stress relief causes the yield strength to change significantly , which would affect J-integral significantly ; 3 ) post-build machining processes to obtain the required standard specimen geometry release a significant amount of residual stress , which also gives incorrect J-integral value ; 4 ) the interface is so brittle that it is very difficult to machine it to the required standard configuration . 
Hence a more effective method that combines printing experiments and residual stress simulation is proposed to determine the as-built critical J-integral of the interface . 
Next , the experimentally-validated modified inherent strain method is utilized to simulate residual stress and compute the critical J-integral at where the interfacial cracking occurs . 
The proposed method is subsequently validated using the obtained critical J-integral to predict cracking in different geometries . 
This method eliminates the uncertainties associated with stress relaxation by heat treatment and machining on mechanical properties , as well as sheds light on crack prediction for as-built L-PBF components . 
This study aims to investigate the fabrication feasibility of a conventionally rolled low-carbon low-alloy shipbuilding steel plate ( EH36 ) by emerging wire arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) technology using ER70S feedstock wire . 
Following the fabrication process , different heat treatment cycles , including air-cooling and water-quenching from the intercritical austenitizing temperature of 800 °C , were applied to both conventionally rolled and WAAM samples . 
Microstructural features and mechanical properties of both rolled and WAAM fabricated ship plates were comprehensively characterized and compared before and after different heat treatment cycles . 
Both air-cooling and water-quenching heat treatments resulted in the formation of hard martensite-austenite ( MA ) constituents in the microstructure of the rolled ship plate , leading to the increased hardness and tensile strength and reduced ductility of the component . 
On the other hand , air-cooling heat treatment was found to homogenize the microstructure of the WAAM ship plate , causing a slight decrease in the hardness and tensile strength , while the water-quenching cycle led to the formation of acicular ferrite and intergranular pearlite , contributing to the improved mechanical properties of the part . 
Therefore , the enhanced mechanical integrity of the water-quenched WAAM component as compared to its rolled counterpart verified the fabrication feasibility of the ship plates by the WAAM . 
The ability to combine multiple materials ( MM ) into a single component to expand its range of functional properties is of tremendous value to the ceaseless optimization of engineering systems . 
Although fusion and solid-state joining techniques have been typically used to join dissimilar metals , additive manufacturing ( AM ) has the potential to produce MM parts with a complex spatial distribution of materials and properties that is otherwise unachievable . 
In this work , the selective laser melting ( SLM ) process was used to manufacture MM parts which feature steep material transitions from 316L stainless steel ( SS ) to Ti-6Al-4V ( TiA ) through an interlayer of HOVADUR® K220 copper–alloy ( CuA ) . 
The microstructure in both the CuA/SS and TiA/CuA interfaces were examined in detail and the latter was found to be the critical interface as it contained three detrimental phases ( i.e . 
L21 ordered phase , amorphous phase , and Ti2Cu ) which limit the mechanical strength of the overall MM part . 
By making use of the non-homogeneity within the melt pool and limiting the laser energy input , the relatively tougher interfacial α′-Ti phase can be increased at the expense of other brittle phases , forming what is essentially a composite structure at the TiA/CuA interface . 
During tensile testing , the interfacial α′-Ti phase is capable of deflecting cracks from the relatively brittle TiA/CuA interface towards the ductile CuA interlayer and an overall tensile strength in excess of 500 MPa can be obtained . 
This method of introducing an interfacial composite structure to improve MM bonding is envisioned to be applicable for the SLM of other metallic combinations as well . 
A stereolithographic approach based on thiol-ene click chemistry is developed to 3D print preceramic polymers into infusible thermosets . 
Three classes of preceramic polymers , including siloxane , carbosilane and carbosilazane , are additively manufactured . 
Upon pyrolysis , thermosets transform into glassy ceramics with uniform shrinkage and high density . 
A fabricated SiOC honeycomb exhibits a significantly higher compressive strength to weight ratio in comparison to other porous ceramics . 
Here we introduce a versatile stereolithographic route to produce three different kinds of Si-containing thermosets that yield high performance ceramics upon thermal treatment . 
Due to the rapidity and efficiency of the thiol-ene click reactions , this additive manufacturing process can be effectively carried out using conventional light sources on benchtop printers . 
Through pyrolysis the thermosets transform into glassy ceramics with uniform shrinkage and high density . 
The obtained ceramic structures are nearly fully dense , have smooth surfaces , and are free from macroscopic voids and defects . 
A fabricated SiOC honeycomb was shown to exhibit a significantly higher compressive strength to weight ratio in comparison to other porous ceramics .

In this work , a family of thermite-based reactive materials is created and evaluated for the suitability as composite energetic structures . 
The burn rate with respect to binder ratio is observed to be highly predictable and exponential ( coefficients of determination of rTi2=0.984 and rAl2=0.973 ) , with composites transitioning from one binder mass fraction to another . 
To create composites , a single layered syringe and nozzle are used in conjunction with continuous filament direct ink writing . 
The resulting prints show success in composite structure with a transition zone between printed materials . 
These results show both a variety of thermite-based energetics with easily modifiable reaction rates and a technique to print said reactive materials to create composite structures . 
Space agencies are looking for advanced technologies to build light weight and stiff payload components to bear space environment and launch loads . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) techniques like Direct Metal Laser Sintering ( DMLS ) is one of the suitable option which can be explored for space applications . 
This paper highlights the development process of Antenna Feed Array ( AFA ) using DMLS as an Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) technique . 
Such horns are preferred for this development as they are the prime choice for feed elements in High Throughput satellites ( HTS ) that employ Multibeam Antennas . 
In the development process , certain design rules of AM are adopted based on consideration to produce self-sustaining structures . 
AFA realized by DMLS is evaluated by functional testing , vibration testing for space qualification test levels . 
Variations in local processing parameters and conditions in additively manufactured materials make mechanical properties difficult to characterize . 
Microtensile testing is providing a wealth of information on these local property variations . 
Here we utilize spatial autocorrelation techniques to show autocorrelation of grain sizes and mechanical properties with build height in a specially-designed , additively manufactured AlSi10Mg part . 
This result suggests that , at least in some cases , an interplay between local part geometry and the fabrication process occurs that affects local mechanical properties . 
Complex thermal behaviour during fabrication plays an import role in the geometrical formation and mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V components manufactured using Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing ( WAAM ) technology . 
In this study , through in-situ temperature measurement , the heat accumulation and thermal behaviour during the gas tungsten wire arc additive manufacturing ( GT-WAAM ) process are presented . 
The effects of heat accumulation on microstructure and mechanical properties of additively manufactured Ti6Al4V parts were studied by means of optical microscopy ( OM ) , X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , energy dispersive spectrometer ( EDS ) and standard tensile tests , aiming to explore the feasibility of fabricating Ti6Al4V parts by GT-WAAM using localized gas shielding . 
The results show that due to the influences of thermal accumulation , the layer ’ s surface oxidation , microstructural evolution , grain size , and crystalline phase vary along the building direction of the as-fabricated wall , which creates variations in mechanical properties and fracture features . 
It has also been found that it is necessary to maintain the process interpass temperature below 200 °C to ensure an acceptable quality of Ti6Al4V part fabricated using only localized gas shielding in an otherwise open atmosphere . 
This research provides a better understanding of the effects of heat accumulation on targeted deposition properties during the WAAM process , which will benefit future process control , improvement , and optimization . 
A novel binder-free 3D printing method with zero process contaminants is developed . 
The first ever study on employing microwave ( MW ) sintering for inkjet 3D printing . 
Reduction of sintering time up to four times compared to conventional sintering . 
Discussion on thermal and non-thermal effects in MW sintering of 3D printed parts . 
3D printing ( 3DP ) is a two-step additive manufacturing technique ( AM ) in which additively manufactured green parts in the first step are transformed into functional parts during the second step . 
Here we use capillary-mediated binderless 3DP as a novel method to additively manufacture green parts of Mg-5.06Zn-0.15 Zr powder . 
A unified perspective on the development steps of process parameters to obtain sufficient handling strength and a high level of dimensional accuracy in the green parts without compromising its chemical composition is established by using a scanning electron microscope , X-ray micro-tomography , vibrational spectroscopy , and chemical analysis . 
For the first time , microwave ( MW ) sintering is successfully used for densification of the green parts with centimeter-scale dimensions in which the primary chemical composition of the Mg-Zn-Zr powder is retrieved from the green parts , resulting in a compositionally zero-sum AM process . 
It is found that swelling leads to loss of shape fidelity during MW sintering of the green parts at temperatures ≥ 510 °C . 
As discussed in the context of thermal and non-thermal effects , MW significantly reduced sintering time by a factor of three to four times when compared to sintering in a conventional furnace . 
The results of this study suggest the notion of capillary-mediated binderless 3DP as well as MW sintering as a potential alternative for the first and second steps of 3DP , respectively . 
Wire and arc additive manufacturing of HSLA steel was performed . 
Microstructure and mechanical properties were related to the thermal cycles . 
No preferential texture was developed , leading to near-isotropic mechanical properties . 
As-built parts exhibited excellent ductility and high mechanical strength . 
Wire and arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) is a viable technique for the manufacture of large and complex dedicated parts used in structural applications . 
High-strength low-alloy ( HSLA ) steels are well-known for their applications in the tool and die industries and as power-plant components . 
The microstructure and mechanical properties of the as-built parts are investigated , and are correlated with the thermal cycles involved in the process . 
The heat input is found to affect the cooling rates , interlayer temperatures , and residence times in the 800–500 °C interval when measured using an infrared camera . 
The microstructural characterization performed by scanning electron microscopy reveals that the microstructural constituents of the sample remain unchanged . 
i.e. 
, the same microstructural constituents—ferrite , bainite , martensite , and retained austenite are present for all heat inputs . 
Electron backscattered diffraction analysis shows that no preferential texture has been developed in the samples . 
Because of the homogeneity in the microstructural features of the as-built parts , the mechanical properties of the as-built parts are found to be nearly isotropic . 
Mechanical testing of samples shows excellent ductility and high mechanical strength . 
This is the first study elucidating on the effect of thermal cycles on the microstructure and mechanical properties during WAAM of HSLA steel . 
Components produced by near net shape additive manufacturing processes often require subsequent subtractive finishing operations to satisfy requisite surface finish and geometric tolerances . 
It is well established that the microstructure and properties of the as-built component are sensitive to the additive processing history . 
Therefore , downstream secondary processes may be affected by the as-built components ’ mechanical behavior . 
In this work we study the sensitivity of secondary machining operations on CoCrMo samples produced via laser powder bed fusion . 
Utilizing novel high-throughput mechanical testing , microstructure characterization , and a rigorous statistical analysis we investigate the degree of material anisotropy present in the as-built material . 
We then study the effects of this anisotropy on secondary processing via slot milling experiments . 
Our results indicate that mechanical anisotropy is driven by both the morphology of the microstructure as well as crystallographic texture . 
The machining force response is correspondingly sensitive to these sources of anisotropy , which has the potential to impact how manufacturers finish additively built parts . 
This study presents a detailed characterization of room temperature bulk microstructure and texture of additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V alloy samples with the neutron time-of-flight diffractometer HIPPO . 
A comparison is made between samples that were manufactured by two different methods utilizing selective laser melting and electron beam melting . 
Analysis of the orientation distribution function shows a dependency upon the particular fabrication technique used as well as on the location within the built body and orientation relative to the build direction . 
It is shown that the texture components strength in the hexagonal phase depends on the relative tilt angle between the build direction and that the overall texture of samples prepared with the electron beam method is weaker than those prepared with the selective laser melting . 
Such knowledge on the bulk microstructure allows to optimize additive manufacturing process parameters . 
One rapidly advancing technology with high space resource utilization potential is additive manufacturing . 
Additive manufacturing is already prevalent in the aerospace industry and is an enabling technology of significant potential for weight savings , cost reduction , tool repair , and just-in-time manufacturing . 
In the last few years , institutions such as ASTM International and NASA have released standards for additive manufacturing , but research done in the field of additive manufacturing with space resources is still in its infancy . 
Among the technologies under investigation , powder bed fusion technologies for melting regolith show particular promise due to their efficiency and freedom from binder material . 
As strict material and process control is difficult with space resource utilization focused technology , the lessons learned by terrestrial manufacturing experts are still being adapted for use in the burgeoning field.Proposed is a framework for adapting existing standards for use with space resources by identifying specific risks and fundamental factors for part quality , determining part criticality , and documenting material , process controls , environmental conditions , and other influencing factors . 
This research explored the influences of shielding gases on the appearance of weld beads and the microstructures and mechanical properties of thin-wall samples using conventional gas metal arc welding as the heat source by using 5356 aluminium alloy welding wire as the raw materials and nitrogen ( N2 ) and argon ( Ar ) as the shielding gases . 
The results showed that under the same parameters and after mono-layer single-bead welding was performed using N2 as the shielding gas , the bead height was higher , the bead width was narrower , and the penetration depth was shallower . 
The grain size of the thin-wall sample protected by N2 was 43.5–47.8 % smaller than that obtained under Ar protection . 
However , the sample protected by N2 contained many flaky nitrides , whose presence improved the microhardness but reduced the ultimate tensile strength ( UTS ) and plasticity . 
The average UTS of the thin-wall sample protected by N2 in the horizontal direction was 82.5 % of the UTS of the samples shielded using Ar . 
However , the average elongation in the horizontal direction of the samples protected by N2 was 18.6 % of that of the samples shielded by Ar . 
The mechanical properties of the sample protected by argon were more excellent . 
An eco-design for AM framework based on energy performance assessment has been proposed . 
A simulation tool has been proposed to predict energy consumption of AM . 
Design mechanisms and the workflow for eco-design for AM have been discussed . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) has been considered as a promising technology with higher resource efficiency and better ecological benefits in production systems . 
If the parameters are not designed appropriately , the ecological performance of AM can be worse than conventional manufacturing processes . 
To ensure the ecological benefits of AM , eco-design based on Life Cycle Assessment ( LCA ) is a promising approach to analyze and minimize the environmental impacts of AM . 
However , LCA can only be carried out at the later stage of the design process after most design and decision operations are already made because the implementation of LCA requires detailed process and inventory information of the entire life cycle . 
If users attempt to optimize the ecological performance of their design solutions , they need to repeat almost the entire design process . 
The proposed approach uses a holistic framework consisting of three parts : a simulation tool for energy consumption prediction of AM , an assessment model for energy performance of AM , and general workflows of eco-design for AM . 
Since the energy performance quantification and assessment of AM require less process information , it can be integrated earlier and easier into the eco-design for AM . 
Additionally , an example of use case is provided that confirms the feasibility of this framework . 
By employing selective laser melting ( SLM ) , we demonstrate how Sn3Ag4Ti alloy can robustly bond to silicon via additive manufacturing . 
With this technology , heat removal devices ( e.g. 
, vapor chamber evaporators , heat pipes , micro-channels ) can be directly printed onto the electronic package without using thermal interface materials . 
This reduces operating temperature , saving power and reducing electronic-waste . 
The bonding of common metal alloys used in additive manufacturing onto silicon is relatively weak and generally possesses high contact angles ( poor wetting and interfacial strength ) . 
By using the proper interlayer material , wettability and reactivity with the silicon substrate increase drastically . 
Unlike conventional dissimilar material brazing that can take tens of minutes to form a strong bond , this study demonstrates how this kinetic limitation can be overcome to form a good bond in sub-milliseconds via intense laser heating . 
The mechanism for rapid bonding lies in using an alloy that can form a strong intermetallic bond to the substrate at a low temperature , and exposing the sample multiple times to give sufficient diffusion time for a strong bond . 
Bonding of Sn3Ag4Ti to silicon occurs through the formation of a thin ( ∼μm ) titanium-silicide interfacial layer that makes the silicon wettable to the Sn3Ag4Ti . 
These printed parts are mechanically resistant to thermal cycling , with no mechanical failures visible after over a week of continuous thermal cycling ( −40 °C and 130 °C ) . 
Additively manufactured low porosity equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi alloy parts . 
Parts are single phase with inter-cellular regions enriched in Mn and Ni . 
Tensile properties exceeded most previous work on similar alloys . 
Initiation of pitting for CoCrFeMnNi alloy was comparable to 304 L stainless steel . 
This study investigates the mechanical and corrosion properties of as-built and annealed equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi alloy produced by laser-based directed energy deposition ( DED ) Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) . 
The high cooling rates of DED produced a single-phase , cellular microstructure with cells on the order of 4 μm in diameter and inter-cellular regions that were enriched in Mn and Ni . 
Annealing created a chemically homogeneous recrystallized microstructure with a high density of annealing twins . 
The average yield strength of the as-built condition was 424 MPa and exceeded the annealed condition ( 232 MPa ) , however ; the strain hardening rate was lower for the as-built material stemming from higher dislocation density associated with DED parts and the fine cell size . 
In general , the yield strength , ultimate tensile strength , and elongation-to-failure for the as-built material exceeded values from previous studies that explored other AM techniques to produce the CoCrFeMnNi alloy . 
Ductile fracture occurred for all specimens with dimple initiation associated with nanoscale oxide inclusions . 
The breakdown potential ( onset of pitting corrosion ) was similar for the as-built and annealed conditions at 0.40 VAg/AgCl when immersed in 0.6 M NaCl . 
A passive oxide film depleted in Cr cations with substantial incorporation of Mn cations is proposed as the primary mechanism for local corrosion susceptibility of the CoCrFeMnNi alloy . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) enables the fabrication of complex lattice structures , for which a single part may have hundreds or thousands of individual geometric features . 
Conventional methods for measuring part geometry and performing quality control , which typically use a small number of low-dimensional measurements , are not well suited for lattice structures . 
This paper describes a method for scanning and automatically extracting individual features of the lattice and applies this method to characterize AM lattice structures in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional lattices . 
The research measured 94 lattice parts fabricated from 3 materials in 9 different designs using either a high-resolution document scanner or X-ray computed tomography ( CT ) . 
A statistical analysis considered manufacturing variances as a function of material type and part design on a subset of the data , comprising the size and location of over 15,000 individual features . 
We studied the geometric variations of these struts in uniform , hierarchical and gradated parts . 
For a single design and material , the standard deviation of lattice feature size is quite small . 
For example , a lattice strut with thickness 0.5 mm has a standard deviation of 30 μm . 
However , when the same process is used to manufacture multiple parts having different designs and from different materials , the standard deviation of feature size can be larger by 2X or more . 
This type of automated measurement and analysis may allow for rigorous monitoring , qualification and control of AM lattice parts in production . 
The adhesion and merging of adjacent filaments in polymer extrusion based additive manufacturing ( AM ) plays a key role in determining the thermal and mechanical properties of the built part . 
It is well known that maintaining the deposited filaments at a high temperature aids in the process of adhesion and merging . 
While external mechanisms such as laser and infrared heating have been used in the past to heat up deposited filaments , this paper presents a simpler , less invasive and in situ mechanism for heating of previously deposited layers using a hot metal block integrated with and rastering together with the filament-dispensing nozzle . 
Infrared thermography based quantitative measurement of temperature field along the raster line is carried out for two configurations – a preheater and a postheater traveling ahead of or behind the nozzle respectively . 
In each case , significant temperature rise in the deposited filaments is shown . 
The measured temperature rise is shown to be a function of process parameters such as raster speed and heater-to-base gap . 
Experimental measurements are shown to agree well with theoretical and simulation models . 
Cross-section imaging of samples printed without and with the in situ heating clearly show significant improvement in neck growth and filament-to-filament merging compared to the baseline case . 
Improvement in thermal and structural performance of printed samples is also demonstrated . 
The improved temperature field and consequently enhanced filament adhesion reported here may help design and build parts with superior thermal and mechanical properties using polymer AM . 
Pore structures of additively manufactured metal parts were investigated with X-ray Computed Tomography ( XCT ) . 
Disks made of a cobalt-chrome alloy were produced using laser-based powder bed fusion ( PBF ) processes . 
The additive manufacturing processing parameters ( scan speed and hatch spacing ) were varied in order to have porosities varying from 0.1 % to 70 % so as to see the effects of processing parameters on the formation of pores and cracks . 
The XCT images directly show three-dimensional ( 3D ) pore structure , along with cracks . 
Qualitative visualization is useful ; however , quantitative results depend on accurately segmenting the XCT images . 
Methods of segmentation and image analysis were carefully developed based , as much as possible , on aspects of the images themselves . 
These enabled quantitative measures of porosity , including how porosity varies in and across the build direction , pore size distribution , how pore structure varies between parts with similar porosity levels but different processing parameters , pore shape , and particle size distribution of un-melted powder trapped in pores . 
These methods could possibly serve as the basis for standard segmentation and image analysis methods for metallic additively manufactured parts , enabling accurate and reliable defect detection and quantitative measures of pore structure , which are critical aspects of qualification and certification . 
The aluminium alloy wire 2319 is commonly used for Wire + Arc Additive Manufacturing ( WAAM ) . 
It is oversaturated with copper , like other alloys of the precipitation hardening 2 # # # series , which are used for structural applications in aviation . 
Residual stress and distortion are one of the biggest challanges in metal additive manufacturing , however this topic is not widely investigated for aluminium alloys . 
Neutron diffraction measurements showed that the as-built component can contain constant tensile residual stresses along the height of the wall , which can reach the materials ' yield strength . 
These stresses cause bending distortion after unclamping the part from the build platform . 
Two different rolling techniques were used to control residual stress and distortion . 
Vertical rolling was applied inter-pass on top of the wall to deform each layer after its deposition . 
This technique virtually elimiated the distortion , but produced a characteristic residual stress profile . 
Side rolling instead was applied on the side surface of the wall , after it has been completed . 
An interesting observation from the neutron diffraction measurements of the stress-free reference was the significantly larger FCC aluminium unit cell dimension in the inter-pass rolled walls as compared to the as-build condition . 
This is a result of less copper in solid solution with aluminium , indicating greater precipitation and thus , potentially contibuting to improve the strenght of the material . 
This work demonstrates the feasibility of fabricating bulk nanostructured high modulus steels in-situ by additive manufacturing . 
This ideal match of novel processes and alloy concepts opens up new pathways for lightweight design by producing light , stiff , strong and ductile components with minimal geometric restraints . 
On the example of an Fe – Ti – B alloy , a conventional processing sequence of melting and casting pre-alloys , gas-atomisation and laser powder bed fusion ( selective laser melting ) led to finely dispersed metastable particle and matrix phases . 
A simple annealing step transformed them into the desired equilibrium constituents of ductile ferrite ( matrix ) and light and stiff TiB2 ( particles ) , with only minimal changes in particle size ( about 20–150 nm in diameter ) and distribution ( mainly on the matrix grain boundaries ) . 
This nano-scaled composite structure promises an extremely attractive property profile , i.e . 
an increased stiffness/ratio at elevated strength and without deteriorated ductility . 
However , the not yet optimized parameters of the laser fusion process led to the formation of few pores and cracks , which prevented the complete assessment of the property profile of the manufactured samples . 
Material and processing strategies for the further development of this promising lightweight design approach – including the suitability of other powder metallurgy processing routes – are outlined and discussed . 
Metal Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) processes have made it possible to build parts with complex geometric features by adopting a layer-by-layer approach . 
However , additional support structures are needed to support overhanging surfaces and reduce distortion that may occur in these parts . 
This increases the overall build time of the part and leads to additional post processing efforts for removal of support structures . 
Further , support structures have a detrimental effect on the surface finish on the areas of the part that come in contact with the supports . 
Thus , minimizing the need for support structures and ensuring its maximum removal is essential for an efficient part build in AM . 
Part build orientation is the main parameter that influences the need for support structures to build a part . 
This paper presents an approach to identify the best build orientation for a part such that the overall part build time is minimized while ensuring maximum removal of supports and minimizing the contact area between the part surface and supports . 
A hierarchical octree data structure has been used to analyze support accessibility and the area of support in contact with part . 
A 2D setup map highlighting the feasible directions of setups for support removal has also been presented . 
The estimation for overhang angle of a 3D structural surface is established by fitting the local element density distribution with a density hyperplane in ℝ4 space . 
The 3D hanging feature issue is resolved by the combination of horizontal minimum length constraint and overhang angle constraint . 
A constraint-based approach for 3D topology optimization with a large number of element-wise constraints is proposed to obtain an accurate solution . 
This paper studies additive manufacturing oriented structural topology optimization with SIMP approach and aims at 3D high-resolution printable structural topology design with overhang and horizontal minimum length control for minimum compliance.To start with , we construct a hyperplane in ℝ4 by fitting a local element density distribution in the 18 Elements Scheme , use its gradient to estimate the overhang angle , the directional-dependent overhang angle and formulate the corresponding constraints . 
Next , we propose a Horizontal Square Scheme and four support sets around the concerned element . 
The horizontal minimum length was controlled by forbidding the concerned element ’ s density to be larger than the average density of the elements in one of the support sets . 
By combining these two constraints , the hanging feature is well suppressed.A new implementation scheme with an improved weight function is proposed to meet these element wise AM constraints well . 
To get high resolution structural boundaries with low computational efforts , this paper applies the multiresolution topology optimization ( MTOP ) method.The structural TO problem is solved by MMA . 
A number of numerical examples and AM experiments show the effectiveness of this method . 
The present approach works efficiently when the building direction is in slight misalignment with the vertical direction . 
The columnar to equiaxed transition ( CET ) of grain structures associated with processing conditions has been observed during metallic additive manufacturing ( AM ) . 
However , the formation mechanisms of these grain structures have not been well understood under rapid solidification conditions , especially for AM of superalloys . 
This paper aims to uncover the underlying mechanisms that govern the CET of AM metals , using a well-tested multiscale phase-field model where heterogeneous nucleation , grain selection and grain epitaxial growth are considered . 
Using In718 as an example , the simulated results show that the CET is critically controlled by the undercooling , involving constitutional supercooling , thermal and curvature undercoolings in the melt pool , which dictates the extent of heterogeneous nucleation with respect to the grain epitaxial growth during rapid solidification . 
Laser Additive Manufacturing ( LAM ) of light metals such as high-strength Al-based alloys offers tremendous potential for e.g . 
weight reduction and associated reduced fuel consumptions for the transportation industry . 
Typically , commercial Sc-containing alloys , such as Scalmalloy® , rely on precipitation hardening to increase their strength . 
Conventional processing involves controlled ageing during which ordered and coherent Al3Sc precipitates form from a Sc-supersaturated solid solution . 
Here we show how the intrinsic heat treatment ( IHT ) of directed energy deposition ( DED ) can be used to trigger the precipitation of Al3Sc already during the LAM process . 
High number densities of 1023 nano-precipitates per m3 can be realized through solid-state phase transformation from the supersaturated Al-Sc matrix that results from the fast cooling rate in LAM . 
Yet , the IHT causes precipitates to coarsen , hence reducing their strengthening effect . 
We implement alternative solidification conditions to exploit the IHT to form a Zr-rich shell around the Al3Sc precipitates that prevents coarsening . 
Our approach is applicable to a wide range of precipitation-hardened alloys to trigger in-situ precipitation during LAM . 
Thermo-mechanical finite element modeling of additive manufacturing processes , such as Directed Energy Deposition and Laser Powder Bed Fusion , has been widely applied for the prediction and mitigation of part distortion . 
However , as the size of modeled geometries gets larger , the number of nodes and elements required in the finite element mesh increases significantly . 
Because runtime will increase as more nodes are added , it is not practical to conduct full simulations of large builds using standard static meshes . 
Advanced meshing strategy is required to reduce the run time and to retain the accuracy of the prediction . 
In this work , a mesh coarsening strategy is evaluated for predicting temperature , distortion , and residual stress in additive manufacturing , aiming to achieve feasible run times with reasonable accuracy on large builds . 
Directed Energy Deposition of thin wall geometries built from Inconel® 625 and Ti6Al4V is used as a reference and models with 2 levels of Octree mesh coarsening are investigated . 
The thermal history , in situ distortion , residual stress , and run times are compared with previously experimentally validated static mesh results . 
Two levels of mesh coarsening is found to be the most effective case for both materials reducing the computational time by 75 % while reporting less than 2.5 % error for the peak distortion and negligible error for the thermal history difference as compared to the static mesh . 
Keeping two fine layers of elements underneath the heat source is found to be the most efficient in terms of prediction accuracy and run time . 
Cork powder residues were used to produce a biodegradable filament for additive manufacturing . 
The addition of a maleic anhydride-based coupling agent to the PLA matrix improved the mechanical behavior of CPC . 
A cork-like filament fully biodegradable and filled with low granulometry cork powder residues was developed . 
Cork-polymer composites ( CPC ) were prepared using a Brabender type mixer incorporating 15 % ( w/w ) of cork powder ( corresponding to 55 % ( v/v ) ) and having polylactic acid ( PLA ) as matrix . 
In order to promote a chemical adhesion between cork particles and PLA , the effect of maleic anhydride grafted PLA ( MAgPLA ) was studied . 
Fourier Transform Infrared – Attenuated Total Reflection ( FTIR-ATR ) analysis was used to evaluate the functionalization of MAgPLA onto the polymeric chain . 
The addition of MAgPLA enhanced the mechanical behavior by increasing tensile properties while improving the dispersion of cork particles within PLA matrix . 
In addition , cork particles and MAgPLA acted as nucleating agents during PLA melting process . 
To evaluate the printability of the developed CPC filament , specimens were printed by Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) and compared to those obtained by injection molding ( IM ) . 
FFF allowed to preserve the cork alveolar structure in the specimens , benefiting CPC mechanical behavior . 
3D parts could be printed with the CPC filament thereby demonstrating the usefulness of the fully biodegradable cork-based filament here developed . 
3D printed parts exhibit unique characteristics , such as a nonplastic and warm touch , a natural colour and the release of a pleasant odour during the printing process . 
AISI 316L steel was tested under high Hertzian loads at different temperatures . 
The 3D printed material presents higher wear resistance . 
The triboxides present the same chemical composition . 
The material produced using SLM presents a thinner strain-hardened layer . 
The 3D printed material begins dynamic recrystallization at higher temperatures . 
This material is also suitable for use in the 3D printing of metal components.In this study , the wear behavior of AISI 316L steel produced using Selective Laser Melting technology was investigated in order to determine its metallurgical evolution under high Hertzian stress . 
The results were compared to AISI 316L that was classically forged.A preliminary mechanical and microstructural characterization was carried out in order to characterize the material and compare the properties of 3D printed with material that has been forged . 
The wear rates were then calculated using a stylus profilometer . 
The wear tracks were characterized in the top view to determine the composition of the triboxide layer using SEM-EDXS and Raman spectroscopy . 
Cross sections of the samples were then used to conduct SEM analysis in order to determine the thickness of the tribolayer and the characteristics of the strain hardened layer . 
EBSD mapping was also conducted on the same samples to determine the regions in which recrystallization had taken place.The results showed that the 3D printed material has lower wear rates than the forged material , due to the finer microstructure of the material produced by 3D . 
In addition , the triboxides formed on the additively manufactured component were finer , although the nature of the oxide was the same . 
The 3D printed material showed a dynamic recrystallization at 600 °C , while the forged material started to recrystallize at 200 °C . 
Medium powered LPBF machines can process pure Cu to an acceptable level . 
Resistivity of as-built Cu increases by 33 % depending on build orientation . 
Resistivity can be reduced by over 50 % from as-built conditions via heat treatment . 
Electrical resistivity values once heat treated are lower than AlSi10Mg values . 
Pure copper is an excellent thermal and electrical conductor , however , attempts to process it with additive manufacturing ( AM ) technologies have seen various levels of success . 
While electron beam melting ( EBM ) has successfully processed pure copper to high densities , laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) has had difficulties achieving the same results without the use of very high power lasers . 
This requirement has hampered the exploration of using LPBF with pure copper as most machines are equipped with lasers that have low to medium laser power densities . 
In this work , experiments were conducted to process pure copper with a 200 W LPBF machine with a small laser spot diameter resulting in an above average laser power density in order to maximise density and achieve low electrical resistivity . 
The effects of initial build orientation and post heat treatment were also investigated to explore their influence on electrical resistivity . 
It was found that despite issues with high porosity , heat treated specimens had a lower electrical resistivity than other common AM materials such as the aluminium alloy AlSi10Mg . 
By conducting these tests , it was found that despite having approximately double the resistivity of commercially pure copper , the resistivity was sufficiently low enough to demonstrate the potential to use AM to process copper suitable for electrical applications . 
Large Area Additive Manufacturing now enables the fabrication of structures that are dramatically more substantial than those produced with standard 3D printing . 
As the use of support structure is generally not appropriate when printing at these scales , understanding the limits of overhanging feature angles is necessary to establish the economic case for using large 3D printing . 
Additionally , understanding the physics of the process is paramount to avoiding expensive failed prints . 
Rapid sequential layers can result in slumping as the structure retains excessive heat when the next layer is printed . 
The model can be used to insert additional dwell times after each layer so that the next layer of printing initiates after the previous layer is sufficiently cool such that the existing structure is appropriately solidified . 
Inputs to the model include the feedstock material , the number of beads in the overhanging wall , the angle of overhang and the threshold of failure represented as out-of-plane displacement from the intended geometry . 
The proposed thermal model can then be used with slicing software to insert pauses a priori , or can be leveraged during the print in conjunction with infrared imaging in order to provide in situ process control to improve quality and yield . 
Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) as an additive manufacturing process can fabricate near to net shape metallic components directly from Computer aided design models , which may be difficult to fabricate using conventional manufacturing methods . 
In this work , the powdered metals used as the raw material feedstock in the Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) process were studied . 
SLM manufacturing processibility of nickel based super alloy , powders related to the particle Size Distribution ( PSD ) , flow ability , mechanical properties and microstructures was investigated . 
Different powder characterisation methods were also investigated to establish which might be most useful for SLM application . 
Three different Inconel 625 ( IN625 ) powder feedstock materials have been accounted for this study . 
Firstly , three different IN625 powders were fully characterised for chemical composition , particle size distribution and flow ability using different types of characterisation techniques . 
It has been found that the presence of any significant proportion of powder particles smaller than 10-μm diameter , leads to severe agglomeration and make SLM processing difficult . 
Secondly , coupons were manufactured using SLM from each powder with different process parameter , which were analysed for porosity and mechanical behaviour . 
Next , the scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , electron back scattering diffraction ( EBSD ) are employed to investigate the microstructures . 
Finally , data analysis was employed on the data collected by metal powders characterization , SLM manufacturing , SEM/EBSD study and mechanical properties of the IN625 . 
It has been observed that the powder characteristics , as well as SLM process parameters influences on the quality of the IN625 fabricated . 
Binder jetting additive manufacturing ( BJAM ) is a comparatively low-cost process that enables manufacturing of complex and customizable metal parts . 
This process is applied to low-cost water-atomized iron powder with the goal of understanding the effects of printing parameters and sintering schedule on maximizing the green and sintered densities of manufactured samples , respectively . 
The powder is characterized by using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and particle size analysis ( Camsizer X2 ) . 
In the AM process , the effects of powder compaction , layer thickness , and liquid binder level on green part density are investigated . 
Post-process heat treatment is applied to selected samples , and suitable debinding parameters are studied by using thermo-gravimetric analysis ( TGA ) . 
Sintering at various temperatures and durations results in densities of up to 91.3 % . 
Image processing of x-ray computed tomography ( μCT ) scans of the samples reveals that porosity distribution is affected by powder spreading , and gradients in pore distribution in the sample are largely reduced after sintering . 
The results indicate that the sintering temperature and time might be tailored to achieve target densities anywhere in the range of 64 % and 91 % , with possibly higher densities by increasing sintering time . 
Binder-jetting , an additive manufacturing process and relatively low-cost technology is utilized to deposit complex-shaped thin ceramic cores . 
In this study , for enhancing sintering quality , a decomposable binder was prepared using binder-jetting by dispersing different contents of zirconium basic carbonate ( ZBC ) into an inorganic colloidal binder . 
The effects of different ZBC contents on the printability of the binder and the performance characteristics of the ceramic cores by binder-jetting were investigated . 
The results show that the surface tension of the binder decreases with the increasing of ZBC contents , indicating that the addition of ZBC particles perturbs the interaction between water molecules . 
The presence of newly generated ZrO2 particles decomposed by ZBC demonstrated a significant effect on the mechanical properties of the ceramic cores . 
The sintered density increased by about 44 % , the bending strength improved from 60 to 79 MPa , and linear shrinkage decreased from 20 to 13 % after sintering at 1500 °C as the ZBC content was increased from 0 to 35 wt % . 
Purposely introduced gas pores in wire + arc additive manufactured titanium ( WAAM Ti-6Al-4 V ) . 
Interrupted fatigue testing with X-ray computed tomography scanning at intervals . 
Changes in porosity morphology observed with fatigue loading cycles . 
Cyclic stress-strain response in the vicinity of gas pores calculated by finite element method . 
Fatigue life predicted using the traditional notch fatigue approach . 
Porosity defects remain a challenge to the structural integrity of additive manufactured materials , particularly for parts under fatigue loading applications . 
Although the wire + arc additive manufactured Ti-6Al-4 V builds are typically fully dense , occurrences of isolated pores may not be completely avoided due to feedstock contamination . 
This study used contaminated wires to build the gauge section of fatigue specimens to purposely introduce spherical gas pores in the size range of 120–250 micrometres . 
Changes in the defect morphology were monitored via interrupted fatigue testing with periodic X-ray computed tomography ( CT ) scanning . 
Prior to specimen failure , the near surface pores grew by approximately a factor of 2 and tortuous fatigue cracks were initiated and propagated towards the nearest free surface . 
Elastic-plastic finite element analysis showed cyclic plastic deformation at the pore root as a result of stress concentration ; consequently for an applied tension-tension cyclic stress ( stress ratio 0.1 ) , the local stress at the pore root became a tension-compression nature ( local stress ratio −1.0 ) . 
Fatigue life was predicted using the notch fatigue approach and validated with experimental test results . 
Processing-structure-property relationships in material extrusion additive manufacturing are complex , non-linear , and poorly understood . 
In this work , we designed an informatics workflow for the collection of high pedigree data from each stage of the fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) printing process . 
In conjunction with a design of experiments , we applied the workflow to investigate the influences of processing parameters on weld strength across three commercially available FFF printers . 
Environmental , material , and print conditions that may impact performance were monitored to ensure that relevant data were collected in a consistent manner . 
Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS ) filament was used to print ASTM D638-14 Type V tensile bars . 
Data were analyzed using multivariate statistical techniques , including principal component analysis . 
The magnitude of the effects of extrusion temperature , layer thickness , print bed temperature , and print speed on the tensile properties of the final print were determined . 
The results demonstrated that printer selection is important and changes the impact of print parameters . 
Non-destructive dielectric imaging during additive manufacturing . 
3D characterization of relative dielectric permittivity within printed devices . 
Integrated , in-line quality control technique for AM processes . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) techniques are used increasingly for the direct fabrication of microwave devices , such as graded index lenses and dielectric resonator antennas , which have spatially-varying dielectric properties ( i.e . 
However , there is no effective method to characterize the spatial distribution of permittivity within the printed component , either during manufacture or once the component is complete . 
Therefore it is not possible to confirm the extent to which the manufactured spatial distribution of permittivity meets the intended design . 
We report the integration of a novel split ring resonator ( SRR ) surface mapping technique directly into an AM process to make non-destructive in-line measurements of the local relative dielectric permittivity ( ϵr ) within 3D objects as they are formed . 
We then reconstruct these data into 3D dielectric “ images ” of the printed component . 
Detailed insights into the dielectric imaging principle , data processing/analysis , as well as limitations and opportunities related to the technique are described . 
The work aims to accelerate the design-make-test cycle for advanced microwave devices , and suggests the possibility for real-time , closed-loop control of dielectric properties during AM . 
Variation of texture in Ti-6Al-4V samples produced by three different additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes has been studied by neutron time-of-flight ( TOF ) diffraction . 
The investigated AM processes were electron beam melting ( EBM ) , selective laser melting ( SLM ) and laser metal wire deposition ( LMwD ) . 
Additionally , for the LMwD material separate measurements were done on samples from the top and bottom pieces in order to detect potential texture variations between areas close to and distant from the supporting substrate in the manufacturing process . 
Electron backscattered diffraction ( EBSD ) was also performed on material parallel and perpendicular to the build direction to characterize the microstructure . 
Understanding the context of texture for AM processes is of significant relevance as texture can be linked to anisotropic mechanical behavior . 
It was found that LMwD had the strongest texture while the two powder bed fusion ( PBF ) processes EBM and SLM displayed comparatively weaker texture . 
The texture of EBM and SLM was of the same order of magnitude . 
These results correlate well with previous microstructural studies . 
Additionally , texture variations were found in the LMwD sample , where the part closest to the substrate featured stronger texture than the corresponding top part . 
The crystal direction of the α phase with the strongest texture component was [ 112¯3 ] . 
Carries out in situ high speed imaging of polymer extrusion additive manufacturing . 
Measures thermal conductivity of built part as a function of process parameters . 
Develops correlation between process , microstructure and thermal properties . 
Results show strong dependence of thermal property on raster speed & layer height . 
Results may be helpful for process optimization to obtain novel , functional parts . 
Additive manufacturing has gained significant research attention due to multiple advantages over traditional manufacturing technologies . 
A fundamental understanding of the relationships between process parameters , microstructure and functional properties of built parts is critical for optimizing the additive manufacturing process and building parts with desired properties . 
This is also critical for a multi-functional part where the process needs to be optimized with respect to disparate performance requirements such as mechanical strength and thermal conductivity . 
This paper presents in situ high speed imaging and build-direction thermal conductivity measurements of polymer extrusion based additively manufactured parts in order to understand the effect of process parameters such as raster speed , infill percentage and layer height on build-direction thermal conductivity . 
Measurements of thermal conductivity using a one-dimensional heat flux method are correlated with in situ process images obtained from a high speed camera as well as cross section images of the built part . 
Results indicate strong dependence of build-direction thermal conductivity on raster speed , layer thickness and infill percentage , which is corroborated by high speed imaging of the printing process at different values of these process parameters . 
Key trade-offs between process throughput and thermal properties are also identified . 
In addition to enhancing our fundamental understanding of polymer extrusion based additive manufacturing and its influence on thermal properties of built parts , results presented here may facilitate process optimization towards parts with desired thermal and multi-functional properties . 
Lightweight design is an area of mechanical engineering that becomes increasingly important in many industries , as they pursue reduced mass and more efficient parts . 
A special class of materials for load-bearing structures are metallic cellular materials with cubic unit cells , which can be manufactured conveniently through laser beam melting ( LBM ) . 
Such materials exhibit a rather complex microstructure and can be analysed using analytical and numerical methods wherein the determination of properties such as relative density , effective elastic and yield strength properties is of special interest . 
This paper addresses closed-form analytical methods based on beam theories for the determination of the effective properties of additively manufactured microstructures such as lattices , and a comparison with experimental results [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] which leads to excellent agreements for relative densities lower than 40 % , although results reveal a great dependency on the manufacturing strategy . 
Lastly , a classification concerning the topology of the cellular units is presented as well in order to help the engineer choose appropriate geometries for specific application purposes . 
In conclusion , this structural concept may be applied in many fields such as bioengineering and in functional graded materials as they are applied in lightweight engineering . 
Polymeric Pellet-Based Additive Manufacturing ( PPBAM ) systems are increasing in the field of 3D printing as a result of the evolution of additive technologies as their development process consolidates and expands . 
New opportunities for industrial integration of additive manufacturing ( AM ) technologies are identified , including AM of large polymeric parts . 
The PPBAM process consists of adapting a pellet-fed extrusion mechanism to a displacement system , either a Cartesian mechanism or a robotic arm system , building parts in a multi-layered approach . 
This use is justified by the extruded filament sizes required and the material costs when facing large-format prints . 
In this article , a pellet extrusion based printer prototype is presented together with a case study . 
The case study consists of the development of a two cubic meter capacity plastic part for the naval industry with a topology optimization design approach and material selection and validation methodology for a large-volume pellet based extrusion system . 
Two functional prototypes were developed with the selected materials from the explained methodology a PLA and a flame retardant ABS , and post processed to full fill the actual product´s specifications . 
The first report on the fatigue behavior of additively manfacutred ( AM ) biodegradable porous Mg alloy ( WE43 ) and how it is affected by biodegradation . 
Biodegradation decreased the fatigue strength of the porous material from 30 % to 20 % of its yield strength . 
Moreover , cyclic loading significantly increased its biodegradation rate . 
The mechanistic aspects of how biodegradation and cyclic loading interacted with each other on both micro and macro scales were revealed . 
Additively manufactured ( AM ) biodegradable metals with topologically ordered porous structures hold unprecedented promise as potential bone substitutes . 
There is , however , no information available in the literature regarding their mechanical performance under cyclic loading or the interactions between biodegradation and cyclic loading . 
We therefore used selective laser melting ( SLM ) to fabricate porous magnesium alloy ( WE43 ) scaffolds based on diamond unit cells . 
The microstructure of the resulting material was examined using electron back-scattered diffraction , scanning transmission electron microscopy , and X-ray diffraction . 
The fatigue behaviors of the material in air and in revised simulated body fluid ( r-SBF ) were evaluated and compared . 
Biodegradation decreased the fatigue strength of the porous material from 30 % to 20 % of its yield strength . 
Moreover , cyclic loading significantly increased its biodegradation rate . 
The mechanistic aspects of how biodegradation and cyclic loading interacted with each other on different scales were revealed as well . 
In addition , dislocations became more tangled after the fatigue tests . 
On the macro-scale , cracks preferred initiating at the strut junctions where tensile stress concentrations were present , as revealed by the finite element analysis of the porous material under compressive loading . 
Further improvements in the biodegradation-affected fatigue performance of the AM porous Mg alloy may therefore be realized by optimizing both the topological design of the porous structure and the laser-processing parameters that determine the microstructure of the SLM porous material . 
Additive manufacturing workflow was employed for fabrication of patient-specific fracture fixation implants . 
Orthotropic material properties of AM implants along with their biomechanical behavior were investigated using experimental and computational methods . 
medial fracture gap displacement ) by 47.2 % and risk of screw cut-out by 14.6 % when compared to the conventional plate design . 
Recent advancements in additive manufacturing ( AM ) have motivated researchers to consider this fabrication technique as a solution for challenges in patient-specific orthopaedic needs . 
Although there is an increasing trend in the applications of AM in medical fields , there is a critical need to understand the biomechanical performance of AM implants . 
In particular , design opportunities , anisotropic material properties and resulting stability of AM implant constructs for large bone defects such as osteosarcoma , comminuted fractures and infections are unexplored . 
This study aims to evaluate metal AM for complex fracture fixation using both computational and experimental methods . 
In addition , this research highlights the role of AM in the entire workflow to fabricate metal AM fixation plates for treatment of comminuted proximal humerus fractures .

Subsequently , risk of screw cut-out is evaluated using finite element modelling ( FEM ) of AM implant-bone constructs . 
medial fracture gap displacement ) by 47.2 % and risk of screw cut-out by 14.6 % when compared to the conventional plate design . 
Findings from this study can be extended to other patient anatomy , loading conditions , and AM processes . 
The feasibility of a hybrid additive manufacturing ( AM ) method combining material extrusion and powder bed binder jetting ( PBBJ ) techniques for fabrication of structures made of silicone ( polysiloxane ) is investigated in this paper . 
A full factorial experimental design was conducted to maximize the geometrical accuracy of the parts . 
The rheological and morphological properties of the silicone powders , the thermal characteristics of the liquid silicone binder , and mechanical characterization the additively manufactured parts are reported . 
Using this hybrid AM method , porous cylindrical structures ( 5 mm diameter ( D ) × 3 mm height ( H ) ) with potential applications in biomedical industry were additively manufactured . 
The final structures are composed of ∼60 % silicone powder , ∼ 30 % silicone binder , and < 10 % air voids . 
These three phases are distributed throughout the structure in a non-uniform fashion . 
Powder bed binder jetting additive manufacturing was used for the first time to produce porous silicone ( polysiloxane ) structures.Download : Download high-res image ( 285 Additive manufacturing of soft magnetic materials and components based on laser powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) offers new opportunities for soft magnetic core materials in efficient energy converters . 
For more favorable material compositions like FeSi6.7 ( strategy 1 ) with larger electrical resistivity and close-to-zero magnetostriction a maximum permeability of μmax = 31,000 , minimum coercivity of Hc = 16 A/m and hysteresis losses of 0.7 W/kg at 1 T and 50 Hz have been realized . 
Feasibility , functionality and potential of the different strategies ( and combinations thereof ) are discussed based on first prototypes and supporting simulations . 
The results are compared to conventional electrical steel and SMC ( soft magnetic composites ) . 
This work investigates the feasibility of a binderless , extrusion-based additive manufacturing approach to fabricate alumina ( Al2O3 ) parts from nanopowder . 
Traditional manufacture of ceramics with subtractive methods is limited due to their inherent hardness and brittleness , inevitably leading to ceramic parts with less-than-optimal geometries for the specific application . 
With an additive manufacturing approach , ceramic parts with complex 3D geometries , including overhangs or hollow enclosures , become possible . 
These complex ceramic parts are highly valuable in heat exchanger , condenser , biomedical implant , chemical reactant vessel , and electrical isolation applications . 
This research employed direct coagulation of alumina nanopowder slurries with the polyvalent salt tri-ammonium citrate providing the solidification mechanism in an extrusion-based printing process . 
The viscosity of the slurries was adjusted from ∼35 Pa-s to ∼1000 Pa-s by adjusting pH from ∼9 to ∼4 , resulting in a paste that is suitable for extrusion , which retains near-net geometry . 
It was shown that the direct coagulation approach can be used to create a suspension with tuneable flow characteristics and coagulation rate , and a mechanism describing the process was proposed . 
The direct coagulation printing ( DCP ) method is described in detail , including how slurry is extruded , solidified , and printed in complex geometries , and sintered to full density . 
Parts were printed with a sintered resolution of 450 μm and green densities as high as 65 % . 
Mechanical properties were characterized with a comparison to different materials and methods from literature , showing hardness and flexural modulus up to ∼1800 HV and 400 GPa , respectively . 
Heat transfer in standoff region between nozzle tip and bed is critical . 
Carries out infrared based temperature measurement in standoff region . 
Develops analytical model to predict temperature distribution in standoff region . 
Shows good agreement between measurements and model in wide range of parameters . 
Contributes towards accurate thermal design of polymer additive manufacturing . 
Dispensing of a polymer filament above its glass transition temperature is a critical step in several polymer-based additive manufacturing techniques . 
While the nozzle assembly heats up the filament prior to dispense , it is important to minimize cooling down of the filament in the standoff distance between the nozzle tip and bed . 
While heat transfer processes within the nozzle assembly , such as filament melting , and on the bed , such as thermally-driven filament-to-filament adhesion , have been well studied , there is a lack of work on heat transfer in the filament in the standoff region . 
This paper presents infrared thermography based measurement of temperature distribution in the filament in the standoff region , and an analytical model for heat transfer in this region . 
The analytical model , based on a balance between thermal advection and convective/radiative heat loss predicts an exponentially decaying temperature distribution , the nature of which is governed by the characteristic length , a parameter that combines multiple process parameters such as mass flowrate , filament diameter , heat capacity and cooling conditions . 
Experimental data in a wide range of process parameters are found to be in very good agreement with the analytical model . 
The thermal design space for ensuring minimal temperature drop in the standoff region is explored based on the analytical model . 
Experimental data and theoretical modeling presented here improve our fundamental understanding of heat transfer in polymer additive manufacturing , and may contribute towards design tools for thermal optimization of these processes . 
A complete understanding of processing-structure-property-performance relationship of additively manufactured ( AM ) components are critical from an application standpoint . 
Therefore , in the current investigation , a comprehensive microstructural characterization and mechanical properties ( tensile , fatigue and impact toughness ) evaluation of nickel alloy 718 AM by the laser powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) technique have been performed . 
AM builds were made from powders manufactured via different atomization conditions . 
Although the standard post-heat treatment procedure led to the removal of severe interdendritic segregation both grain boundary and intra-grain precipitation of δ phase occurred . 
Regardless of δ phase presence , axial fatigue properties of both the AM builds were similar to design handbook wrought fatigue data . 
However , due to the δ phase , impact toughness properties were comparable to the wrought material conditions that exhibited δ phase . 
Fractured surfaces of Charpy impact samples exhibited crack propagation extensively along the boundaries decorated by δ precipitates . 
Variability in the mechanical properties of additively manufactured metal parts is a key concern for their application in service . 
One of the parameters affecting the above-mentioned property is solidification texture which is driven by scan patterns and other process variables . 
Understanding of how these textures arise in the AM process can provide a pathway to control these features which ultimately decide the final structural material properties . 
In this work , a Cellular Automata ( CA ) based two-dimensional microstructure model is formulated and implemented to understand grain evolution in AM . 
Grain evolution in multilayer depositions using various scan patterns in Directed Energy Deposition ( DED ) , Metal Laser Sintering/Selective Laser Melting ( MLS/SLM ) , and Electron Beam Melting ( EBM ) is presented and qualitatively compared with reported literature . 
Results show strong correlation of scan patterns with evolving grain orientations . 
Variability in grain size and orientation evolution during SLM and EBM processing of metallic materials showed direct influence by exposure to different cooling rates and thermal gradients . 
The similarities between the simulated and reported results lead us to conclude CA based modeling for predicting grain orientation and size in metal AM processes is useful for prediction of continuum level structural properties at global and local length scales . 
This paper presents the methodology and findings of a novel piece of research with the purpose of understanding and mitigating distortion caused by the combined processes of additive manufacturing ( AM ) and post machining to final specifications . 
The research work started with the AM building of a stainless steel 316 L industrial impeller that was then machined by removing around 0.5 mm from certain surfaces of the impeller ’ s blades and hub . 
Distortion and residual stresses were experimentally measured.The manufacture of the impeller by AM and then machining was numerically simulated by applying the finite element ( FE ) method . 
Distortion and residual stresses were simulated and validated . 
The FE distortion was then used in a numerical procedure to reverse distortion directions in order to produce a new impeller with mitigated distortion . 
A 2-stage hybrid manufacturing supply chain based on metal Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) is proposed which includes AM hubs , Heat Treatment ( HT ) facilities and machine shops . 
p-median models are applied to identify the optimal location for metal AM hubs in the U.S. that would serve as near-net manufacturers to supply processed build plates to HT facilities who will ship it to machine shops after HT . 
Fewer number of heat treatment facilities require concentrated locations and fewer AM hubs . 
Hybrid Manufacturing is defined as the integration of Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) , specifically metal AM , with traditional manufacturing post-processing such as heat treatment and machining . 
Hybrid AM enables Small and Medium Enterprises ( SME ) who can offer post-processing services to integrate into the growing AM supply chain . 
Most near-net metal AM parts require heat treatment processes ( e.g . 
residual stress relieving/annealing ) before machining to achieve final engineering specification . 
This research investigates a two-stage facility model to optimize the locations and capacities for new metal AM hubs which require two sequential post-processing services : heat treatment and machining . 
Using North American Industry Classification System ( NAICS ) data for machine shops and heat treatment facilities in the U.S. , a p-median location model is used to determine the optimal locations for AM hub centers based on : ( 1 ) geographical data , ( 2 ) demand and ( 3 ) fixed and operational costs of hybrid-AM processing . 
Results from this study have identified : ( a ) candidate US counties to locate metal AM hubs , ( b ) total cost ( fixed , operational and transportation ) , ( c ) capacity utilization of the AM hubs and ( d ) demand assignments across machine shops – heat treatment facilities – AM hubs . 
It was found that 2-stage p-Median model identified 22 A M hub locations as the initial sites for AM hubs which grows to 35 A M hubs as demand increases . 
It was also found that relatively fewer number of heat treatment facilities than machine shops resulted in a more concentrated locations of AM hubs . 
In addition , transportation costs were not adversely affected by the inclusion of as-build plates and showed that including heat treatment facilities as part of the hybrid AM supply chain will be mutually beneficial to all stakeholders of metal hybrid AM supply chain , i.e . 
AM → Heat treatment → Machining . 
Wire arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) is a promising direct energy deposition technology to produce high-value material components with a low buy-to-fly ratio . 
WAAM is able to produce thin-walled structures of large scale and also truss structures without any support . 
To manufacture complex parts , process reliability and repeatability are still a necessity and this often leads to long developing times . 
In this paper , a method is proposed to automatically manufacture complex truss structures with point by point arc additive manufacturing and a six axis robot . 
Computer aided manufacturing ( CAM ) software is designed to manage ( i ) material deposition at intersections and ( ii ) collisions between the part under construction and the torch . 
Because it is difficult to model the deposition process , the bead geometry is monitored using video imaging . 
Image treatment program detects the contour of the deposit and computes its current position . 
With this position , the CAM software corrects the geometry of the part for future deposition . 
Simple case studies are tested to validate the algorithm . 
Two solid free form geometries designed by topology optimization are manufactured with this skeleton arc additive manufacturing process . 
Ti-6Al-4V powders from six different vendors were compared with respect to their microstructures , size-distributions , chemistries , surface appearances , flow behavior , and packing densities . 
The analysis approaches followed closely ASTM F3049 , the standard guide for characterization of additive manufacturing metal powders . 
Chemistries , including impurity content , agreed well with the standard requirements . 
Powder particle microstructures revealed acicular alpha prime for all vendors . 
Quantificational analysis of porosity in the WAAM 2319 alloy was revealed by XCT . 
The formation and evolution of micropores are affected by microstructures . 
Evolution mechanisms include particles dissolution , H pore precipitation and growth . 
Majority of the micropores were adjacent to second phase particles . 
Given its detrimental influence on mechanical properties , porosity defect is a major problem for wire + arc additively manufactured ( WAAM ) Al components . 
We performed X-ray computed tomography , optical microscopy , and scanning electron microscopy to observe the spatial distribution , size , and shape of micropores and reveal their formation and evolution mechanisms during the deposition and heat treatment of the WAAM 2319 Al alloys . 
Key findings demonstrated that thehydrogenmicropores and solidification microvoids existed in as-deposited alloys . 
The amounts and morphologies of hydrogen micropores and solidification microvoids varied from the top , middle , and bottom of the wall sample because of the distinct microstructure and second-phase distribution in each section . 
After the heat treatment , a significant variation in micropores involving three main evolution mechanisms , namely , hydrogen micropore precipitation , phase particle dissolution , and micropore growth , was observed . 
Results of this research may provide a solid foundation for the safe application of WAAM Al alloy structures . 
In this study , the heterogeneous anisotropic microstructure and mechanical properties of additively manufactured ( CoCrFeMnNi ) 99C1 high-entropy alloy ( HEA ) are comprehensively investigated using experimental and theoretical analyses . 
For the present alloys , the selective laser melting ( SLM ) process produced orthogonally anisotropic microstructure with not only strong macroscopic morphological but also sharp microscopic crystallographic textures . 
Moreover , due to the complex thermal gradient and history in the melt pools , the columnar grains were heterogeneously evolved along the building direction with alternatively arranged layers of fine and coarse grains parallel to the laser scanning direction . 
This unique morphological texture played a dominant factor for the big difference in tensile properties between different loading directions in the early stage of deformation . 
In particular , the alternatively arrangement of fine and coarse grains could generate high hetero-deformation induced ( HDI ) hardening along the scanning direction in the as-built samples by profuse evolution of geometrically necessary dislocation at the boundaries of each layer . 
On the other hand , upon the last stage of plastic deformation , the crystallographic texture played a crucial role in directional flow behavior by modulating twinning activity . 
The combined contribution of the various anisotropic microstructural factors to the tensile properties of the SLM-processed HEAs was clarified both qualitatively and quantitatively . 
This work will shed light on effective utilization of both heterogeneity and anisotropy of the structural parts for customized performance via expanding multi-scale freedom of design in additive manufacturing . 
IN625 grains grew epitaxially on the fine grains of SS316L forming Type-I interface . 
Bidirectional nucleation from IN625 and mushy zone at SS316L formed Type-II interface . 
Cracking was formed at Type-II interface and in the SS316L tracks . 
Cracking mechanisms include solidification , liquidation , and ductility dip cracking . 
This research illustrates the rationale of adopting a preferred printing sequence by examining crack generation predominated by resultant interfaces and microstructural inhomogeneity , through underlying governing mechanisms in directed energy deposition of 316L stainless steel/Inconel 625 ( SS316L/IN625 ) bimetals . 
For this purpose , microstructural and crystallographic characterizations augmented by numerical simulations were employed on additively manufactured two distinct interfaces , i.e . 
Type-I ( IN625 deposition on SS316L ) and Type-II ( SS316L deposition on IN625 ) . 
Changing the printing sequence generated these two types of interfaces with unique morphologies , which was found attributable to the compositional variations and mismatch in thermal properties . 
Type-I interface was typified by gradual-change composition in the transition zone , causing the IN625 grains to grow epitaxially on the grains of SS316L . 
Type-II interface was characterized as a compositional sudden-change zone ( CSCZ ) adjacent to SS316L , leading to merging bidirectional nucleation and grain growth from the bottom IN625 and upper CSCZ , and lack of epitaxial growth . 
Additionally , high cracking susceptibility occurred near the Type-II interface rather than the Type-I interface , which was related to solidification and liquidation cracking , and further promoted ductility dip cracking . 
This research will provide a guideline for the additive manufacturing of bimetals with the consideration of printing sequence to control interface formation for a crack-free structure . 
X-ray μCT used for non-destructive measurement of porosity through the multiple stages of the CEAM . 
Porosity was quantified and mapped within the parts by using image analysis . 
Vertical and radial gradient of porosity and pore size observed in green , de-bound and sintered samples . 
The microscopic and macroscopic quality of samples improves through the process stages . 
Ceramic Extrusion Additive Manufacturing ( CEAM ) enables the die-less fabrication of small ceramic parts , with a process chain that includes four consecutive stages : the 3D printing , solvent de-binding , thermal de-binding , and sintering . 
The 3D printing process was implemented through Ephestus , a specially developed EAM machine for the manufacturing of parts from alumina feedstock . 
A test part was designed , and X-ray computed tomography ( μ-CT ) was used to quantify its characteristics through the processing stages of the EAM . 
The porosity distribution and the distribution of void size and shape were determined throughout the samples at each stage , using image analysis techniques . 
Furthermore , the evolution of some macroscopic quality properties was measured.The results show that both microscopic ( porosity ) and macroscopic ( geometry , density ) properties of the samples improve through the process stages . 
A vertical gradient of porosity is present in green and de-bound samples , with porosity decreasing with increasing sample height . 
After sintering , the vertical gradient of porosity disappears . 
The sphericity and the diameter of voids are negatively correlated and dispersed over a wide range in the green state . 
The sintering process has a homogenization effect on the void shape distribution . 
The geometrical deviation from the nominal designed dimensions and the surface quality of parts improves when moving from the green to the sintered state . 
Experimental investigation of porosities in additive manufactured ceramics parts.Download : Download high-res image ( 178 In this paper , the authors explore the use of impedance-based monitoring techniques for in-situ detection of additive manufacturing build defects . 
By physically coupling a piezoceramic ( PZT ) sensor to the part being fabricated , the measured electrical impedance of the PZT can be directly linked to the mechanical impedance of the part . 
It is hypothesized that one can detect build defects in geometry or material properties in-situ by comparing the signatures collected during printing of parts with that of a defect-free control sample . 
In this paper , the authors explore the layer-to-layer sensitivity for both PZT sensors embedded into printed parts and for a fixture-based PZT sensor . 
For this work , this concept is evaluated in context of material jetting . 
A set of control samples is created and used to establish a baseline signature . 
( e.g. 
, internal voids ) are fabricated and their layer-to-layer signatures are compared to a control sample . 
Using this technique , the authors demonstrate an ability to track print progress and detect defects as they occur . 
For embedded sensors the defects were detectable at 2.28 % of the part volume ( 95.6 mm3 ) and by fixture-based sensors when it affected 1.38 % of the part volume . 
Surface roughness of an as produced AM component is very high , which prohibits the direct utilization of additively manufactured ( AM ) components for the intended applications . 
Reducing surface roughness is exponentially more challenging for the internal surfaces of an AM component . 
This paper reports our research in the area of postprocessing of interior surfaces of an AM component . 
We have investigated electropolishing and chemical polishing ( chempolishing ) methods to reduce the surface roughness of the internal surface . 
We found that chempolishing was effective in simultaneously reducing the internal and external surface roughness of 316 steel AM components . 
Chempolishing is found suitable for any complicated AM shape and geometry . 
Our electropolishing methodology was effective in reducing the surface roughness of the internal or external surfaces provided that a counter electrode could be positioned in the proximity of the surface to be polished . 
We have performed optical profilometry , scanning electron microscopy , and contact angle measurement study to investigate the difference between electropolishing and chemical polishing methods . 
Modelling of wire-arc additive manufacturing process is an effective way for adapting the optimum parameters as well as understanding and managing the sequences of layer-by-layer deposition . 
Some of these parameters such as toolpath , deposition intervals and heat source power play important roles in improving the process viability and cost efficiency . 
In this article , we have studied Al-5Mg , Al-3Si alloys as demonstrators , from both experimental and modelling perspectives , to benchmark different deposition parameters and provided guidelines for optimising the process conditions . 
Physical values such as total distortion and residual stress were selected as indicators for the manufacturability of the structure . 
The simulations were performed by Simufact Welding software , that is outfitted with the MARC solver and the experiments were executed in a robotic cell . 
We have introduced a method for optimising the process parameters based on the heat source power modification and selection of unique parameters for each deposition layer . 
This was performed by monitoring the evolution of the molten pool size and geometry when building a wall structure . 
The results suggest that achieving an uninterrupted deposition process entails modification of the heat input for each layer . 
Thus , a simple analytical method was proposed to estimate the heat input reduction coefficient for a wall structure as a function of molten pool geometry and the height at which , a new layer is being deposited . 
It was also shown that a generic selection of parameters for aluminium alloys may impair the eventual quality for some of the alloys due to their inherent physical properties such as high temperature flowability . 
In the current investigation , an ultrasonic imaging system originally developed for visualization of microstructures in sheet metals , with capabilities of generating plane two-dimensional images at spatial resolutions between 1 and 200 μm , was used to quantitatively evaluate a Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) processed 3D test part . 
For the ultrasonic system , a custom software program was written to control all components of the inspection schemes in a continuous scan mode , including the movement of three orthogonal translational stages , as well as display a live ultrasonic image during scanning and provide tools for advanced post-processing of the recorded ultrasonic signals . 
Prior to collecting ultrasonic data for a selected test specimen , an optical flat reference standard was used to characterize the ultrasonic probes and to quantify the system ’ s mechanical stability , repeatability , and accuracy when measuring the physical dimensions of features . 
Ultrasonic data collected at different spatial resolutions were used to characterize a part ’ s surface flatness , internal defects , and fusion conditions ; and to measure the physical dimensions of intended features . 
Finally , a suggestion is made for adopting a process to qualify or certify FFF based additive manufacturing machines in the market by applying a reliable NDE validation method to a standardized part with various features of different shapes and physical dimensions . 
Successful printing of high-performance material with suitable properties using additive manufacturing methods such as Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) can create many advanced applications in industries . 
However , the high viscosity of high-performance polymers causes complications during the FFF process and reduces the final print quality . 
To overcome this challenge , Inorganic Fullerene Tungsten Sulphide ( IF-WS2 ) nanoparticles are applied in this study to enhance the flowability of poly-ether-ketone-ketone ( PEEK ) without compromising its mechanical and thermal properties . 
In the first step , different loadings of IF-WS2 nanoparticles are melt compounded with PEEK and the nanocomposites are characterized . 
SEM and EDX images of fractured surfaces indicate that a good dispersion of nanoparticles is achieved without any pre-treatment or pre-dispersion . 
A reduction in melt viscosity of 25 % , and a simultaneous growth in storage modulus , crystallization and degradation temperature of about 60 % , 53 % and 100 °C is found with addition of 2 wt % IF-WS2 to PEEK , respectively . 
This great achievement is mainly ascribed to the unique characteristics of IF-WS2 nanoparticles , acting as both reinforcing and lubricating agents , indicated by a reduction in coefficient of friction . 
There is no significant increase of crystallization and melting temperatures with the addition of IF-WS2 nanoparticles , which is beneficial in the FFF process . 
In the second step , the PEEK nanocomposite filaments are printed via FFF . 
The print quality and mechanical properties of the printed PEEK are also improved with the incorporation of IF-WS2 nanoparticles . 
Hence , incorporation of IF-WS2 nanoparticles into PEEK via melt compounding is an effective approach for the development of suitable high-performance engineering materials for FFF . 
Dislocation structures , chemical segregation , γ′ , γ″ , δ precipitates , and Laves phase were quantified within the microstructures of Inconel 718 ( IN718 ) produced by laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing ( AM ) and subjected to standard , direct aging , and modified multi-step heat treatments . 
Additionally , heat-treated samples still attached to the build plates vs. those removed were also documented for a standard heat treatment . 
The effects of the different resulting microstructures on room temperature strengths and elongations to failure are revealed . 
Knowledge derived from these process-structure-property relationships was used to engineer a super-solvus solution anneal at 1020 °C for 15 min , followed by aging at 720 °C for 24 h heat treatment for AM-IN718 that eliminates Laves and δ phases , preserves AM-specific dislocation cells that are shown to be stabilized by MC carbide particles , and precipitates dense γ′ and γ″ nanoparticle populations . 
This “ optimized for AM-IN718 heat treatment ” results in superior properties relative to wrought/additively manufactured , then industry-standard heat treated IN718 : relative increases of 7/10 % in yield strength , 2/7 % in ultimate strength , and 23/57 % in elongation to failure are realized , respectively , regardless of as-printed vs. machined surface finishes . 
In this work the effect of manufacturing strategy and post process treatment on the high strain rate ( HSR ) compressive deformation behavior of additively manufactured powder bed fusion 17-4PH stainless steel is studied . 
Specimens were fabricated using three different laser vector path strategies to impart different thermal histories and resulting microstructures in the material . 
The effect of post processing in the form of hot isostatic pressing and heat treatment and their effect on HSR compressive deformation response of the material was studied . 
Defect characteristics were quantified using x-ray micro computed tomography . 
It was found that the laser vector strategy had a strong influence on the development of microstructure and defect characteristics and spatial distribution in the materials which strongly influence the HSR response and the HSR compressive flow stresses of the materials varied by as much as 43 % in the regimes tested . 
This work proposes a finite element ( FE ) analysis workflow to simulate directed energy deposition ( DED ) additive manufacturing at a macroscopic length scale ( i.e . 
part length scale ) and to predict thermal conditions during manufacturing , as well as distortions , strength and residual stresses at the completion of manufacturing . 
The proposed analysis method incorporates a multi-step FE workflow to elucidate the thermal and mechanical responses in laser engineered net shaping ( LENS ) manufacturing . 
For each time step , a thermal element activation scheme captures the material deposition process . 
Then , activated elements and their associated geometry are analyzed first thermally for heat flow due to radiation , convection , and conduction , and then mechanically for the resulting stresses , displacements , and material property evolution . 
Simulations agree with experimentally measured in situ thermal measurements for simple cylindrical build geometries , as well as general trends of local hardness distribution and plastic strain accumulation ( represented by relative distribution of geometrically necessary dislocations ) . 
Residual stresses play an important role for the structural integrity of engineering components . 
In this study residual stresses were determined in titanium alloy ( Ti-6Al-4V ) and Inconel 718 samples produced using selective-laser-melting ( SLM ) additive manufacturing . 
The contour method and a numerical simulation approach ( inherent-strain-based method ) were used to determine the residual stress distributions . 
The inherent-strain-based method reduces the computational time compared to weakly-coupled thermo-mechanical simulations . 
Results showed the presence of high tensile residual stresses at and near the surface of both titanium and Inconel alloys samples , whereas compressive residual stresses were seen at the center region . 
A good agreement was seen between the results obtained from contour method and the numerical simulation , particularly 1 mm below the surface of the samples . 
This study presents an automated thresholding method for analyzing and quantifying the internal composition of additive manufacturing ( AM ) parts using computed tomography ( CT ) data . 
A mixed skewed-Gaussian distribution ( MSGD ) algorithm , derived from a statistical image analysis technique called Mixed Gaussian Distribution ( MGD ) clustering , integrates a mixture of skewed-Gaussian distributions to model the internal phases from CT data . 
The parameters of the MSGD algorithm ( i.e . 
probability , mean , standard deviation , and skew ) are inferred from the measured grayscale histogram using least-squares fitting and are assigned to phases present in the CT data . 
From the MSGD fitted and thresholded CT data , phase volume percentages and spatial variations of density of the phases are quantified . 
The MSGD algorithm was validated using previously reported CT analysis and experimental porosity measurements of two Cobalt Chrome ( CoCr ) specimens ( ∼1 % and ∼13 % porosity ) fabricated by powder bed fusion ( PBF ) . 
Compared with the 1.1 % and 13.7 % porosity of the specimens measured by the Archimedes method , the MSGD method predicted a porosity of 1.6 % +/− 0.7 % and 14.5 % +/− 1.9 % , a measured increase of 0.5 % and 0.8 % , respectively . 
These results show a similarity in predicted porosity between Archimedes and MSGD method indicating that CT and the MSGD method may provide a reasonable estimate for part porosity . 
Developed a design and fabrication workflow for DM-based FGM structures . 
The workflow integrates material as well as structural design with fabrication . 
Used a simplified regression-based model to predict the mechanical behavior of DMs . 
Experimentally validated the workflow with the help of voxel printed FGM structures . 
Voxel-based multimaterial jetting additive manufacturing allows fabrication of digital materials ( DMs ) at the meso-scale ( ∼1 mm ) by controlling the deposition patterns of soft elastomeric and rigid glassy polymers at the voxel-scale ( ∼90 μm ) . 
The digital materials can then be used to create heterogeneous functionally graded material ( FGM ) structures at the macro-scale ( ∼10 mm ) programmed to behave in a predefined manner . 
This offers huge potential for design and fabrication of novel and complex bespoke mechanical structures.This paper presents a complete design and manufacturing workflow that simultaneously integrates material design , structural design , and product fabrication of FGM structures based on digital materials . 
This is enabled by a regression analysis of the experimental data on mechanical performance of the DMs i.e. 
, Young ’ s modulus , tensile strength and elongation at break . 
This allows us to express the material behavior simply as a function of the microstructural descriptors ( in this case , just volume fraction ) without having to understand the underlying microstructural mechanics while simultaneously connecting it to the process parameters.Our proposed design and manufacturing approach is then demonstrated and validated in two series of design exercises to devise complex FGM structures . 
First , we design , computationally predict and experimentally validate the behavior of prescribed designs of FGM tensile structures with different material gradients . 
Second , we present a design automation approach for optimal FGM structures . 
The comparison between the simulations and the experiments with the FGM structures shows that the presented design and fabrication workflow based on our modeling approach for DMs at meso-scale can be effectively used to design and predict the performance of FGMs at macro-scale . 
Porous titanium and tantalum structures were fabricated by additive manufacturing with 30 % volume fraction designed porosity . 
Nanotubes were formed on the surface of the porous titanium using anodization process ( TNT ) . 
Porous TNT and porous Ta showed comparable new bone formation as early as 5 weeks after surgery in a rat distal femur model . 
Our findings for TNT pave a way to avoid high manufacturing cost related to biomedical application of tantalum . 
Material properties of implants such as volume porosity and nanoscale surface modification have been shown to enhance cell-material interactions in vitro and osseointegration in vivo . 
Porous tantalum ( Ta ) and titanium ( Ti ) coatings are widely used for non-cemented implants , which are fabricated using different processing routes . 
In recent years , some of those implants are being manufactured using additive manufacturing . 
However , limited knowledge is available on direct comparison of additively manufactured porous Ta and Ti structures towards early stage osseointegration . 
In this study , we have fabricated porous Ta and Ti6Al4V ( Ti64 ) implants using laser engineered net shaping ( LENS™ ) with similar volume fraction porosity to compare the influence of surface characteristics and material chemistry on in vivo response using a rat distal femur model for 5 and 12 weeks . 
We have also assessed whether surface modification on Ti64 can elicit similar in vivo response as porous Ta in a rat distal femur model for 5 and 12 weeks . 
The harvested implants were histologically analyzed for osteoid surface per bone surface . 
Field emission scanning electron microscopy ( FESEM ) was done to assess the bone-implant interface . 
The results presented here indicate comparable performance of porous Ta and surface modified porous Ti64 implants towards early stage osseointegration at 5 weeks post implantation through seamless bone-material interlocking . 
Design for Additive Manufacturing ( DfAM ) allows optimising parts by integrating complexity . 
DfAM adds value to powder bed fusion ( PBF ) manufacturing in terms of cost , manufacturing lead time , and productivity . 
Material usage is the main cost driver in metal PBF and is determined by part volume and lattice volume fraction . 
DfAM can reduce the manufacturing cost by 53.7 % , manufacturing time by 54.3 % , and overall weight by 52.5 % . 
DfAM is necessary to increase the economic feasibility of AM business cases . 
The cost-effectiveness of metal powder bed fusion ( PBF ) systems in high-throughput production are dominated by the high cost of metallic powder materials . 
Metal PBF technologies become more competitive in production scenarios when Design for Additive Manufacturing ( DfAM ) is integrated to embed functionality through shape complexity , weight , and material reduction through topology optimization and lattice structures.This study investigates the value of DfAM in terms of unit cost and manufacturing time reduction . 
Input design parameters , such as lattice design-type , part size , volume fraction , material type and production volumes are included in a Design-of-Experiment to model their impact . 
The performance variables for cost and manufacturing time were assessed for two scenarios : ( i ) outsourcing scenario using an online quotation system , and ( ii ) in-house scenario utilizing a decision support system ( DSS ) for metal PBF.The results indicate that the size of the part and the lattice volume fraction are the most significant parameters that contribute to time and cost savings . 
This study shows that full utilization of build platforms by volume-optimized parts , high production volumes , and reduction of volume fraction lead to substantial benefits for metal PBF industrialization . 
Integration of DfAM and lattice designs for lightweight part production can decrease the unit cost of production down to 70.6 % and manufacturing time can be reduced significantly down to 71.7 % depending on the manufacturing scenarios and design constraints when comparing to solid infill designs . 
The study also provides a case example of a bracket design whose cost is reduced by 53.7 % , manufacturing time is reduced by 54.3 % , and the overall weight is reduced significantly with the use of lattices structures and topology optimization . 
The capability to manufacture items in space is an exploration enabling advancement , and will be crucial for sustainable human exploration as we progress beyond Earth orbit . 
The extrusion based Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) method using thermoplastics represents a robust and simple methodology applicable to printing parts for both current and future human spaceflight exploration missions . 
Understanding the performance and behaviour of the FFF process under varying gravity loads is therefore an important knowledge gap that needs to be addressed in order to fully appreciate the characteristics of space manufactured elements . 
In this study , we detail an experiment conducted on a parabolic flight campaign ( PFC ) wherein we produced a number of FFF polylactic acid ( PLA ) polymer test articles and compared them to terrestrially fabricated articles . 
We report on the methodology and the operational parameters used , as well as presenting an analysis of the samples via optical microscopy and tomography . 
Compressive , tensile and other technical properties are reported herein . 
An approach to teaching additive manufacturing ( AM ) course for engineering students is suggested . 
A pedagogical model was developed , based on PDL strategy , for a 14-week AM course . 
The students designed and 3D printed devices helping people with disabilities . 
The projects served as useful collaborative learning experiences for AM education . 
The course demonstrates the potential of AM technologies as innovative environment . 
The present study suggests an approach to teaching a novel additive manufacturing ( AM ) course for engineering students at the graduate level , developed in 2015 and taught currently at Afeka Academic College of Engineering . 
The proposed course is dedicated to the fundamentals , methods , materials , standards and industrial applications of AM , and involves introduction lectures , special topic lectures organized with industry and academic experts , laboratory training and final engineering projects . 
The first project proposed by the students was to develop and build an opener for medicine containers ; the second was to design and build a device for pouring liquids for people with Parkinson ’ s disease ; and the third was to design and construct a 3D puzzle for blind or visually impaired people . 
All three projects were designed with a computer-aided design program and then printed using the ABS material . 
Quality control ( three-point bending tests and light microscopy ) was routinely conducted on standard specimens printed on the same tray with the components . 
The learning process included two iteration steps that were executed to improve and optimize the structural design . 
The final 3D printed objects , the students ’ presentations , their experience , as reflected in their final reports , and their personal written evaluations , lead to the conclusion that the projects served as useful learning experience for engineering education . 
Here we report a pre-fractal antenna design based on the Sierpinski tetrahedron that has been developed with additive manufacturing . 
The Sierpinski tetrahedron-based antenna was simulated with finite element method ( FEM ) modeling and experimentally tested to highlight its potential for wideband communications . 
The Sierpinski tetrahedron-based antennas were fabricated by two methods , the first involves printing the antenna out of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS ) , followed by spin casting a coating of an ABS solution containing graphene flakes produced through electrochemical exfoliation , the second method involves 3D printing the antenna from graphene-impregnated polylactic acid ( PLA ) filament directly without any coating . 
These antennas incorporate the advantages of 3D printing which allows for rapid prototyping and the development of devices with complex geometries . 
Due to these manufacturing advantages , self-similar antennas like the Sierpinski tetrahedron can be realized which provide increased gain and multi-band performance . 
Lattice structures fabricated via Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) offer improved performance over traditional manufacturing methods , however , predicting their mechanical behaviour both accurately and with acceptable computational efficiency remains a challenge . 
AM associated defects combined with multiple high aspect-ratio strut elements require fine 3D finite-element ( FE ) meshes ; resulting in high computational complexity that limits the number of lattice unit cells that can be practically simulated . 
Alternatively , Euler-Bernoulli or Timoshenko beam elements can be specified to reduce computational complexity . 
However , these beam elements are typically based on idealised representations that exclude AM associated defects . 
This research proposes a novel method which combines data driven AM defect modelling , Markov Chains and Monte Carlo ( MCS ) simulation techniques to predict the stiffness of an AM lattice structure . 
Furthermore , this method accommodates stochastic distributions of AM associated defects within computationally effective beam models ; thereby enabling the simulation of large-scale lattice structures at a relatively low computational cost . 
The proposed method is aimed at reliability analysis or a probabilistic approach to structural analysis of AM lattice structures . 
The combination of generating AM strut digital realisations and MCS , resulted in a variety of possible strut deformation shapes and effective diameters under axial compression . 
The propagation of effective diameter variability to the lattice-scale level displayed the possible variation in the mechanical response of AM lattice structure . 
Simulations are validated and insight into how a lattice structures unit cell topology affects simulation accuracy is discussed . 
The use of laser additive manufacturing based on melting of injected zirconium powder under localized shielding was evaluated in terms of microstructures and mechanical properties of thin wall structures . 
The material was characterized in both the laser travel and the build directions . 
The microstructures , tensile properties and fracture behavior were assessed for deposits made using as-received and recycled powder . 
Electron backscattered diffraction and transmission electron microcopy revealed a fine structure of Zr-α laths with nano-scale iron-rich precipitates at the lath interfaces . 
The properties of the fabricated components , which were made using new as-received powder were comparable to a Zr-2.5Nb alloy substrate , with yield strengths of over 569 MPa and uniform strains up to the ultimate tensile stress ranging from 8.5 to 9.9 % . 
However , when recycled powder was used , the ductility dropped with total strains to failure of 1.0–7.5 % , as a result of porosity and unmelted powder particles serving as brittle inclusions in the deposited material . 
3D printed AlSi10Mg can be used in electrical applications once heat treated Electrical resistivity values once heat treated are comparable to cast alloy values Resistivity of as-built AlSi10Mg increases by 27 % depending on build orientation Heat treatment can reduce as-built resistivity by 33 % Additive manufacturing ( AM ) opens up a design freedom beyond the limits of traditional manufacturing techniques . 
Electrical windings created through AM could lead to more powerful and compact electric motors , but only if the electrical properties of the AM printed part can be shown to be similar to conventionally manufactured systems . 
Until now , no study has reported on the suitability of AM parts for electrical applications as there are few appropriate materials available to AM for this purpose . 
AlSi10Mg is a relatively good electrical conductor that does not have the same reported issues associated with processing pure aluminium or copper via selective laser melting ( SLM ) . 
Here , experiments were conducted to test the effects of geometry and heat treatments on the resistivity of AlSi10Mg processed by SLM . 
It was found that post heat treatments resulted in a resistivity that was 33 % lower than the as-built material . 
The heat treatment also eliminated variance in the resistivity of as-built parts due to initial build orientation . 
By conducting these tests , it was found that , with this material , there is no penalty in terms of higher resistivity for using AM in electrical applications , thus allowing more design freedom in future electrical applications . 
Future exploration missions beyond low-Earth orbit would significantly benefit from a closed loop recyclable Additive Manufactured capability , allowing the production of general purpose tools and items in a time and cost effective manner . 
To realize this ambition , we present a feasibility study of a Solvent-Cast Direct-Write method using Polyvinyl Alcohol as biodegradable material . 
Process parameters such as solution viscosity , evaporation rate , print pressure and scan speed are optimized in order to achieve a consistent and reliable print outcome . 
We demonstrate the process by fabricating test complex geometries of sample specimens . 
Moreover , we report on the mechanical properties of printed geometries as well as the recyclability aspects . 
The aerospace , automotive and medical industries are suffering from significant number of counterfeited metallic products that not only have caused financial losses but also endanger lives . 
The rapid development of additive manufacturing technologies makes such a situation even worse . 
In this investigation , we successfully applied a novel hybrid powder delivery selective laser melting ( SLM ) approach to embed dissimilar tagging material ( Cu10Sn copper alloy ) safety features ( e.g . 
QR code ) into metallic components made of 316 L stainless steel . 
X-ray imaging was found to be a suitable method for the identification of the embedded safety features up to 15 mm in depth . 
X-ray fluorescence was used for the chemical composition identification of the imbedded security tagging material . 
A criterion for the selection of tagging material , its dimensions and imbedding depth is proposed . 
The multiple material SLM technology was shown to offer the potential to be integrated into metallic component production for embedding anti-counterfeiting features . 
The development of cooling devices is important for many industrial products , and the lattice structure fabricated by additive manufacturing is expected to be useful for effective liquid cooling . 
However , lattice density should be carefully designed for an effective arrangement of coolant flow . 
In this research , we optimize the lattice density distribution using a lattice structure approximation and the gradient method . 
Fluid flow is approximated by deriving effective properties from the Darcy–Forchheimer law and analyzing the flow according to the Brinkman–Forchheimer equation . 
We use a simple basic lattice shape composed of pillars , optimizing only its density distribution by setting the pillar diameter as the design variable . 
Steady-state pressure and temperature reductions are treated as multi-objective functions . 
Through 2D and 3D numerical studies , we discuss the validity and limitations of the proposed method . 
Although observable errors in accuracy exist between the results obtained from the optimization and full scale models , relative performance optimization was considered successful . 
Additive manufacturing has seen large growth due to its numerous process advantages , yet some undesirable defects in additive manufactured ( AM ) products include pores and micro-cracks . 
These defects weaken the high temperature oxidation resistance of the final parts . 
In this work , laser shock peening ( LSP ) is used as a post-treatment method to change the surface characteristics of selective laser melted ( SLM ) nano-TiC particle-reinforced Inconel 625 nanocomposites ( TiC/IN625 ) . 
The effects of LSP on surface morphology , residual stress , microhardness , microstructure , and high temperature oxidation behavior of fabricated parts are studied . 
The results indicate pores in the as-built sample can be closed by the severe plastic deformation , which is induced by LSP . 
The maximum hardness is found to reach 462 ± 7 HV with a ∼ 460 μm hardened layer , and the surface stress state transforms from tensile to compressive after LSP . 
The full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) values of the ( 111 ) and ( 200 ) diffraction broaden , which can be attributed to grain refinement and an increase in lattice strain in the LSP samples . 
Dislocation walls and dislocation tangles with high dislocation density form in the LSP sample . 
Compared with as-built sample , the LSP samples exhibit lower mass gain after oxidation at 900 °C for 100 h , indicating that LSP samples have greater oxidation resistance at high temperature . 
The underlying mechanism governing the high temperature oxidation resistance is proposed based on the experimental results . 
This study shows that LSP can be used as an effective method to modify the surface characteristics of SLM TiC/IN625 . 
Many applications require structures composed of layers of heterogeneous materials and prefabricated components embedded between the layers . 
The existing additive manufacturing process based on layered object manufacturing is not able to handle multiple layer materials and can not embed prefabricated components . 
Moreover , the existing process imposes restrictions on the material options . 
This significantly limits the type of heterogeneous structures that can be manufactured using traditional additive manufacturing . 
This paper presents an extension of sheet lamination object manufacturing process by using a robotic cell to perform the sheet manipulation and handling . 
It makes the following three advances : ( 1 ) enabling the use of multi-material layers and inclusion of prefabricated components between the layers , ( 2 ) developing an algorithmic foundation to facilitate automated generation of robot instructions , and ( 3 ) identifying the relevant process constraints related to speed , accuracy , and strength . 
We demonstrate the system capabilities by using three case studies . 
Pure Zn bulk samples of good formation quality and high tensile properties were produced . 
The effect of scanning speed on grain size , morphology and texture was clarified . 
Crystallographic effects resulted to strong anisotropy in mechanical properties . 
The existence of tiny pores in LPBF samples influenced corrosion behavior . 
Corrosion rate increased with increasing scanning speed at the initial stage of immersion , and the gap narrowed as immersion time passed . 
Laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) has been previously used to produce customized medical implants from biodegradable Zn and its alloys . 
In this study , we investigated the effect of the grain structure on the mechanical properties and in vitro corrosion behavior of pure Zn samples , by varying the scanning speed and building direction during the LPBF process . 
Increasing the scanning speed from 300 to 700 mm/s resulted in finer grains , irregular grain morphology , and a weaker grain texture , which enhanced the strength and ductility . 
Vertically built LPBF Zn tensile samples had higher strength and ductility compared with horizontally built samples , indicating strong anisotropy of the mechanical properties . 
Electrochemical tests revealed that the in vitro corrosion behavior was not strongly correlated with the scanning speed . 
This was attributable to the random distribution of tiny pores on the surface of the LPBF samples , although immersion tests showed that the sample prepared with the highest scanning speed exhibited the highest corrosion rate . 
With increasing immersion time in Hank ’ s solution , the Zn2+ concentrations of the samples produced with different scanning speeds increased , their pH stabilized , and the differences between the corrosion rates narrowed . 
The effects of the processing parameters on the final performance of the samples could be well explained by the grain structures . 
The findings of this study afford bases for selecting the processing parameters for optimizing the properties of LPBF-produced Zn parts for biodegradable applications . 
Existing powder feedstock metrics for powder bed fusion ( PBF ) additive manufacturing ( AM ) are related to packing efficiency and flowability , and newer techniques , such as powder rheometry and dynamic avalanche testing , have received recent attention in the literature . 
To date , however , no powder characterization technique is able to predict the spreadability of AM feedstock . 
This study endeavored to establish viable powder spreadability metrics through the development of a spreadability testing rig that emulates the recoating conditions present in commercial PBF AM systems . 
As no metrics for spreadability currently exist , four potential metrics were evaluated in a 3∙23 split plot experimental design . 
These four metrics were : ( 1 ) the percentage of the build plate covered by spread powder , ( 2 ) the rate of powder deposition , ( 3 ) the average avalanching angle of the powder , and ( 4 ) the rate of change of the avalanching angle . 
Three samples of gas atomized , Al-10Si-0.5 Mg PBF powder representing differing degrees of quality were used as the levels of the powder quality input variable . 
As no powder quality metrics have been shown to be indicative of powder spreadability in PBF , various bulk powder characteristics were used as the powder quality indicator during ANOVA . 
Of the four metrics tested , the average avalanching angle , while statistically dependent of the powders angle of repose , showed poor correlation with experimental data . 
poor build plate coverage and powder clumping , as measured by the viable spreading metrics . 
Other processing parameters , such as the recoating speed and the recoater blade material were shown to also influence the spread quality . 
A design strategy for lattice cell configurations beyond Maxwell criterion . 
Established theoretical models to predict compressive modulus and strength . 
Compressive tests and μ-CT to assess mechanical properties and defects . 
A finite element modeling method based on inherent manufacturing defects . 
A comparison of experimental and theoretical results rendered minimal deviation . 
The development of additive manufacturing ( AM ) technology exhibits potential for the design and manufacturing of complex lattice structures . 
Herein , a novel design strategy is proposed for the lattice unit cell configurations , including triangular prism ( T ) , quadrangular prism ( Q ) and hexagonal prism ( H ) , by considering the tight spatial arrangement and manufacturing constraints . 
Moreover , the influence of altering the degree of freedom of nodes , caused by additional struts , on mechanical performance and energy absorption capacity is systematically investigated by theoretical modeling , experimental characterization and finite element method . 
A series of lattice core sandwich panels is designed and manufactured by selective laser melting ( SLM ) . 
X-ray micro-computed tomography ( μ-CT ) is carried out to obtain the realistic geometrical information . 
Quasi-static uniaxial compressive tests are performed to investigate the failure mechanism and mechanical performance . 
The results reveal that the joint connectivity of the unit cell increased with the increase of the number of the struts , resulting in superior compressive modulus and ultimate strength . 
The main deformation mode of cells is gradually changed from bending-dominated to stretch-dominated with the increase of the joint connectivity . 
The proposed design ensures the performance consistency of the manufactured struts and facilitates the theoretical predictions and analysis . 
Furthermore , the specific energy absorption of the structure also increased with the increase of joint connectivity . 
In the case of unit cells with different configurations , T series rendered superior specific strength and specific energy absorption , whereas Q series exhibited excellent specific stiffness . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) is rapidly moving from research to commercial applications due to its ability to produce geometric features difficult or impossible to generate by conventional machining . 
Fielded components need to endure fatigue loadings over long operational lifetimes . 
This work evaluates the ability of shot and laser peening to enhance the fatigue lifetime and strength of AM parts . 
As previously shown , peening processes induce beneficial microstructure and residual stress enhancement ; this work takes a step to demonstrate the fatigue enhancement of peening including for the case of geometric stress risers as expected for fielded AM components . 
We present AM sample fatigue results with and without a stress riser using untreated baseline samples and shot and laser peening surface treatments . 
Laser peening is clearly shown to provide superior fatigue life and strength . 
We also investigated the ability of analysis to select laser peening parameters and coverage that can shape and/or correctively reshape AM components to a high degree of precision . 
We demonstrated this potential by shaping and shape correction using our finite element based predictive modeling and highly controlled laser peening . 
The present work addressed the challenges of identifying applicable Non-Destructive Testing ( NDT ) techniques suitable for inspection and materials characterization techniques for Wire and Arc Additive Manufacturing ( WAAM ) parts . 
With the view of transferring WAAM to the industry and qualifying the manufacturing process for applications such as structural components , the quality of the produced parts needs to be assured . 
Thus , the main objective of this paper is to review the main NDT techniques and assess the capability of detecting WAAM defects , for inspection either in a monitoring , in-process or post-process scenario . 
Radiography and ultrasonic testing were experimentally tested on reference specimens in order to compare the techniques capabilities . 
Metallographic , hardness and electrical conductivity analysis were also applied to the same specimens for material characterization . 
Experimental outcomes prove that typical WAAM defects can be detected by the referred techniques . 
The electrical conductivity measurement may complement or substitute some destructive methods used in AM processing . 
Compressive creep properties of AlSi10Mg parts produced by additive manufacturing selective laser melting ( AM-SLM ) were studied using a spark plasma sintering ( SPS ) apparatus , capable of performing uniaxial compressive creep tests . 
Stress relief-treated specimens were tested under an applied stress of 100–130 MPa in the 175–225 °C temperature range . 
The creep parameters ( i.e. 
, stress exponent n and apparent activation energy Q ) , were empirically determined . 
The experimental results , together with microstructural examination of specimens , indicate that plastic deformation was controlled by dislocation activity . 
Furthermore , it is suggested that the annihilation process of dislocations during creep was enhanced by the electric current . 
This experimental study investigates the combined effect of the three primary Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) build orientations ( 0° , 45° , and 90° ) and an extensive array of heat treatment plans on the plastic anisotropy of maraging steel 300 ( MS1 ) fabricated on the EOSINT M280 Direct Metal Laser Sintering ( DMLS ) system . 
The alloy 's microstructure , hardness , tensile properties and plastic strain behaviour have been examined for various strengthening heat-treatment plans to assess the influence of the time and temperature combinations on plastic anisotropy and mechanical properties ( e.g . 
strength , ductility ) . 
A comprehensive visual representation of the material 's overall mechanical properties , for all three AM build orientations , against the various heat treatment plans is offered through time – temperature contour maps . 
Considerable plastic anisotropy has been confirmed in the as-built condition , which can be reduced by aging heat-treatment , as verified in this study . 
However , it has identified that a degree of transverse strain anisotropy is likely to remain due to the AM alloy 's fabrication history , a finding that has not been previously reported in the literature . 
Moreover , the heat treatment plan ( 6h at 490 °C ) recommended by the DMLS system manufacturer has been found not to be the optimal in terms of achieving high strength , hardness , ductility and low anisotropy for the MS1 material . 
With the use of the comprehensive experimental data collected and analysed in this study , and presented in the constructed contour maps , the alloy 's heat treatment parameters ( time , temperature ) can be tailored to meet the desired strength/ductility/anisotropy design requirements , either for research or part production purposes . 
We have investigated the relationship between structure and thermal conductivity in additively manufactured interpenetrating A356/316L composites . 
We used X-ray microcomputed tomography to characterize the pore structure in as-fabricated composites , finding microporosity in both constituents as well as a 50 μm thick layer of interfacial porosity separating the constituents . 
We measured the thermal conductivity of a 43 vol % 316L composite to be 53 Wm−1K−1 , which is significantly less than that predicted by a simple rule-of-mixtures approximation , presumably because of the residual porosity . 
Motivated by these experimental results we used periodic homogenization theory to determine the combined effects of porosity and unit cell structure on the effective thermal conductivity . 
This analysis showed that in fully dense composites , the topology of the constituents has a weak effect on the thermal conductivity , whereas in composites with interfacial porosity , the size and structure of the unit cell strongly influence the thermal conductivity . 
We also found that an approximation formula of the strong contrast expansion method gives excellent estimates of the effective thermal conductivity of these composites , providing a powerful tool for designing functionally graded composites and for identifying mesostructures with optimal thermal conductivity values . 
In this work , the performance of a focus variation instrument for measurement of areal topography of metal additive surfaces was investigated . 
Samples were produced using both laser and electron beam powder bed fusion processes with some of the most common additive materials : Al-Si-10Mg , Inconel 718 and Ti-6Al-4V . 
Surfaces parallel and orthogonal to the build direction were investigated . 
Measurement performance was qualified by visually inspecting the topographic models obtained from measurement and quantified by computing the number of non-measured data points , by estimating local repeatability error in topography height determination and by computing the value of the areal field texture parameter Sa . 
Variations captured through such indicators were investigated as focus variation-specific measurement control parameters were varied . 
Changes in magnification , illumination type , vertical resolution and lateral resolution were investigated . 
The experimental campaign was created through full factorial design of experiments , and regression models were used to link the selected measurement process control parameters to the measured performance indicators . 
The results indicate that focus variation microscopy measurement of metal additive surfaces is robust to changes of the measurement control parameters when the Sa texture parameter is considered , with variations confined to sub-micrometre scales and within 5 % of the average parameter value for the same surface and objective . 
The number of non-measured points and the local repeatability error were more affected by the choice of measurement control parameters . 
However , such changes could be predicted by the regression models , and proved consistent once material , type of additive process and orientation of the measured surface are set . 
Hot Isostatic Pressing ( HIP ) is a technique of applying high pressures through a fluid medium at high temperatures to enclosed powders , castings and pre-sintered metal parts to eliminate porosity . 
Due to uniform volumetric shrinkage expected from this process , it can be a useful post-processing technique for complex-geometry parts fabricated using Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) techniques . 
In order for the technique to work effectively , parts are typically required to have a minimum density of 92 % , where surface porosity is closed . 
While HIP has been used in conjunction with powder bed fusion AM processes , its use for parts made using Binder Jetting ( BJ ) has not been investigated in detail due to the limitations of BJ in fabricating sufficiently high-density parts without infiltration . 
In this work , detailed investigations on the effect of HIP on BJ parts printed from three different powder configurations , which led to varying levels of porosity , are performed . 
The effects of HIP on the density , microstructure , tensile strength , and ductility of the resulting parts is reported . 
A maximum density of 97.32 % was achieved by HIP of printed and sintered parts created via bimodal powders . 
Both the tensile strength and ductility were found to improve following HIP , which suggests that the reduction in porosity is predominant compared to the detrimental effects of grain coarsening . 
Control of the atomic structure , as measured by the extent of the embrittling B2 chemically ordered phase , is demonstrated in intermetallic alloys through additive manufacturing ( AM ) and characterized using high fidelity neutron diffraction . 
As a layer-by-layer rapid solidification process , AM was employed to suppress the extent of chemically ordered B2 phases in a soft ferromagnetic Fe-Co alloy , as a model material system of interest to electromagnetic applications . 
The extent of atomic ordering was found to be insensitive to the spatial location within specimens and suggests that the thermal conditions within only a few AM layers were most influential in controlling the microstructure , in agreement with the predictions from a thermal model for welding . 
Analysis of process parameter effects on ordering found that suppression of B2 phase was the result of an increased average cooling rate during processing . 
AM processing parameters , namely interlayer interval time and build velocity , were used to systematically control the relative fraction of ordered B2 phase in specimens from 0.49 to 0.72 . 
Hardness of AM specimens was more than 150 % higher than conventionally processed bulk material . 
Implications for tailoring microstructures of intermetallic alloys are discussed . 
Wire–arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) is an emergent method for the production and repair of high value components . 
Introduction of plastic strain by inter-pass rolling has been shown to produce grain refinement and improve mechanical properties , however suitable quality control techniques are required to demonstrate the refinement non-destructively . 
Specifically , undeformed and rolled specimens have been analysed by spatially resolved acoustic spectroscopy ( SRAS ) , allowing the efficacy of the rolling process to be observed in velocity maps . 
The work has three primary outcomes ( i ) differentiation of texture due to rolling force , ( ii ) understanding the acoustic wave velocity response in the textured material including the underlying crystallography , ( iii ) extraction of an additional build metric such as layer height from acoustic maps and further useful material information such as minimum stiffness direction . 
Variations in acoustic response due to grain refinement and crystallographic orientation have been explored . 
This allowed prior-β grains to be resolved . 
A basic algorithm has been proposed for the automated measurement , which could be used for in-line closed loop control . 
Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) professionals often throw around the notion that complexity is free . 
Indeed , complexity is much easier and potentially cheaper to achieve through AM than through traditional manufacturing , but it is not free . 
Upon attempting to manufacture complex designs , it is quickly found that certain features , or topologies , are more manufacturable than others , with sacrificial support material required for many complex designs . 
This will significantly increase machining costs . 
Topology Optimization ( TO ) is a freeform computational design methodology which is ideal for designing lightweight structures through a combination of modeling and rigorous optimization . 
While AM can realize many complex topologies , there still remain AM manufacturing limitations ( such as overhangs ) , which require customized TO design algorithms beyond freeform TO . 
In this work , a projection-based TO methodology is presented to design for 3D self-supporting structures – i.e . 
structures that do not require sacrificial support material . 
The foundation of the presented methodology is a 2D overhang projection framework . 
In addition to expanding the methodology to three dimensions , the algorithm is drastically improved through ( 1 ) adopting a new overhang mapping scheme which allows for exact specification of allowable overhang angle , and ( 2 ) implementing an adjoint approach to sensitivity calculations to speed up calculation drastically and to allow for scalability . 
Using several examples , it is shown that the presented methodology generates self-supporting structures ( given a prescribed printable overhang angle ) which are entirely manufacturable without any added sacrificial support material . 
Upon printing a couple topologies with mixed success , further customization of the algorithm is proposed for situations where multiple directional-dependent overhang angles are possible in a single AM system . 
An analytical process model for predicting the layer height and wall width from the process parameters was developed for wire + arc additive manufacture of Ti-6Al-4V , which includes inter-pass temperature and material properties . 
Capillarity theory predicted that cylindrical deposits were produced where the wall width was less than 12 mm ( radius < 6 mm ) due to the large value of the surface tension . 
Power was predicted with an accuracy of ±20 % for a wide range of conditions for pulsed TIG and plasma deposition . 
Interesting differences in the power requirements were observed where a surface depression was produced with the plasma process due to differences in melting efficiency and/or convection effects . 
Finally , it was estimated the impact of controlling the workpiece temperature on the accuracy of the deposit geometry . 
Processing of Si and hydroxyapatite reinforced Ti6Al4Vmatrix compositesusinglaser-based directed energy deposition ( DED ) from powder blends . 
Si addition helped form in situ reactive phases of titanium silicides and vanadium silicides Composites showed higher hardness , lower coefficient of friction and better wear resistance . 
Directed-energy deposition ( DED ) -based additive manufacturing ( AM ) was explored for composite development using silicon ( Si ) and hydroxyapatite ( HA ) in Ti-6Al-4 V ( Ti64 ) matrix for articulating surfaces of load-bearing implants . 
Specifically , laser engineered net shaping ( LENSTM ) – a commercially available DED-based AM technique – was used to fabricate composites from premixed-feedstock powders . 
The AM ’ d composites proved to not only improve upon Ti64 ’ s mechanical properties but also produced an in-situ Si-based tribofilm during tribological testing that minimized wear induced damage . 
Additionally , it was found that with the introduction of Si , titanium silicides and vanadium silicides were formed ; allowing for 114 % increased hardness , decreased coefficient of friction ( COF ) and a reduction of wear rate of 38.1 % and 70.8 % , respectively , for a 10 wt. 
% Si presence . 
The produced composites also displayed a positive shift in open-circuit potential ( OCP ) during linear wear , along with a reduction in the change of OCP from idle to linear wear conditions . 
Additionally , contact resistance ( CR ) values increased with a maximum value of 1500 ohms due to the formation of Si-based tribofilm on the wear surface . 
Such composite development approach using DED-based AM can open up the possibilities of innovating next-generation implants that are designed and manufactured via multi-material AM . 
We investigate experimentally and numerically the influence of the processing conditions on the cross-section of a strand printed by material extrusion additive manufacturing . 
The parts manufactured by this method generally suffer from a poor surface finish and a low dimensional accuracy , coming from the lack of control over the shape of the printed strands . 
Using optical microscopy , we have measured the cross-sections of the extruded strands , for different layer heights and printing speeds . 
For the first time , we have compared the measurements of strands ’ cross-sections to the numerical results of a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model of the deposition flow . 
The proposed numerical model shows good agreement with the experimental results and is able to capture the changes of the strand morphology observed for the different processing conditions . 
The combination of additive manufacturing principles and electron beam ( EB ) technology allows complex metal parts , featuring excellent quality material , to be produced , whenever traditional methods are expensive or difficult to apply . 
Today , the optimization of process parameters , for a given metal powder , is generally attained through an empirical trial and error approach . 
Process simulation can be used as a tool for decision-making and process optimization , since a virtual analysis can help to facilitate the possibility of exploring “ what if ” scenarios . 
In this work , a new type of modelling has been introduced for energy source and powder material properties and it has been included in a thermal numerical model in order to improve the effectiveness and reliability of Electon Beam Melting ( EBM ) FE simulation . 
Several specific subroutines have been developed to automatically calculate the powder properties as temperature functions , and to consider the position of the beam during scanning as well as the material state changes from powder to liquid in the melting phase and from liquid to solid during cooling . 
A comparison of the numerical results and experimental data taken from literature has shown a good forecasting capability . 
The average deviations of the simulation from an experimental scan line width have been found to be below about 15 % . 
ISO 25178-2 surface texture from X-ray CT , interlaboratory comparison , is presented . 
Less than 0.5 % Sa areal roughness between metrology CT and focus variation values . 
Artefact design allows separation of surface determination and scaling errors . 
The study compared the results obtained for the extraction of areal surface texture data per ISO 25178-2 from five X-ray computed tomography ( CT ) volume measurements from each of four laboratories . 
Two Ti6Al4V ELI ( extra-low interstitial ) components were included in each of the CT acquisitions . 
The first component was an additively manufactured ( AM ) cube manufactured using an Arcam Q10 electron beam melting ( EBM ) machine . 
Surface texture data was extracted from CT scans of this part . 
The values of selected parameters per ISO 25178-2 are reported , including Sa , the arithmetic mean height , for which the values from the Nikon MCT 225 metrology CT measurements were all within 0.5 % of the mean reference focus variation measurement . 
CT resolution requirements are discussed . 
The second component was a machined dimensional test artefact designed to facilitate independent analysis of CT global voxel scaling errors and surface determination errors . 
The results of mathematical global scaling and surface determination correction of the dimensional artefact data is reported . 
The dimensional test artefact errors for the XT H 225 commercial CT for length , outside diameter and inside diameter reduced from -0.27 % , -0.83 % and -0.54 % respectively to less than 0.02 % after performing mathematical correction . 
This work will assist the development of surface texture correction protocols , help define surface-from-CT measurement envelope limits and provide valuable information for an expanded Stage 2 interlaboratory comparison , which will include a more diverse range of CT systems and technologies , further expanding the surface-from-CT knowledge base . 
Bimetallic structures belong to a class of multi-material structures , and they potentially offer unique solutions to many engineering problems . 
In this work , bimetallic structures of Inconel 718 and Ti6Al4V ( Ti64 ) alloys were processed using laser engineered net shaping ( LENS™ ) . 
During LENS™ processing , three build strategies were attempted : direct deposition , compositional gradation and use of an intermediate bond layer . 
Inconel 718 and Ti64 alloys exhibit thermal properties mismatch along with brittle intermetallic phase formation at the interface resulting in delamination . 
For a successful build , the use of a compositional bond layer ( CBL ) was employed , which was a mixture of a third material - Vanadium Carbide - with the parent alloys to form an intermediate layer used in bonding the two immiscible alloys . 
A crack-free bimetallic structure of Inconel 718 and Ti64 was demonstrated . 
Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , energy dispersive spectroscopy ( EDS ) , X-ray diffraction and Vickers hardness were used to characterize these bimetallic structures . 
XRD analysis indicated presence of Cr3C2 phases . 
CBL improved the bonding strength by avoiding formation of brittle intermetallic phases such as TiNi3 and Ti2Ni as well as reducing thermal stresses at the interface . 
Our results successfully demonstrate the formation of Inconel 718 and Ti64 bimetallic structures using a laser-based commercially available additive manufacturing approach . 
Additive manufacturing , also known as 3D printing , is a new technology that obliterates the geometrical limits of the produced workpieces and promises low running costs as compared to traditional manufacturing methods . 
Hence , additive manufacturing technology has high expectations in industry . 
Unfortunately , the lack of a proper quality monitoring prohibits the penetration of this technology into an extensive practice . 
This work investigates the feasibility of using acoustic emission for quality monitoring and combines a sensitive acoustic emission sensor with machine learning . 
The acoustic signals were recorded using a fiber Bragg grating sensor during the powder bed additive manufacturing process in a commercially available selective laser melting machine . 
The process parameters were intentionally tuned to invoke different processing regimes that lead to the formation of different types and concentrations of pores ( 1.42 ± 0.85 % , 0.3 ± 0.18 % and 0.07 ± 0.02 % ) inside the workpiece . 
The classifier , based on spectral convolutional neural network , was trained to differentiate the acoustic features of dissimilar quality . 
In view of the narrow range of porosity , the results can be considered as promising and they showed the feasibility of the quality monitoring using acoustic emission with the sub-layer spatial resolution . 
An automated python script to slice a macro-scale part into micro-scale layers and assign boundary conditions steps for each layer is presented . 
Key parameter interdependencies of resolution , energy and time are investigated in a series of layer-scaling thermomechanical process models . 
Guidelines for simulation the thermal and stress results of higher resolution by lower resolution for the LPBF modelling are proposed . 
A novel efficient method for simulating powder-solid heat conduction by interface surface convection is presented . 
The Laser Beam Powder Bed Fusion ( PBF-LB ) category of Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) is currently receiving much attention for computational process modelling . 
Major challenges exist in how to reconcile resolution , energy and time in a real build , with the practical limitations of resolution ( layer height and mesh resolution ) , energy ( heat format and magnitude ) and time ( heating and cooling step times ) in the computational space . 
A novel thermomechanical PBF-LB process model including an efficient powder-interface heat loss mechanism was developed . 
The effect of variations in layer height ( layer scaling ) , energy and time on the temperature and stress evolution was investigated . 
The influence of heating step time and cooling step time was characterised and the recommended ratio of element size to layer scaling was presented , based on a macroscale 2D model . 
The layer scaling method was effective when scaling up to 4 times the layer thickness and appropriately also scaling the cooling step time . 
This research provides guidelines and a framework for layer scaling for finite element modelling of the PBF-LB process . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) is a rapidly growing technology that enables the fast production of complex and near-net-shaped ( NNS ) components . 
Among the many applicable AM methods ( particularly powder bed technologies ) , electron-beam melting ( EBM ) is gaining increased interest mainly in aerospace and medical industries , due to its inherent advantages for the printing of Ti-6Al-4V alloy . 
Although major strides have been made towards understanding the effect of hot isostatic pressure ( HIP ) on the mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V produced by AM , its effect on corrosion performance remains relatively unexplored . 
To date , the reported corrosion studies remain essentially limited to the selective laser melting ( SLM ) process , while the corrosion behavior of EBM Ti-6Al-4V and particularly HIPed EBM Ti-6Al-4V have not been fully realized . 
This paper provides a detailed analysis of this corrosion performance , including the stress-corrosion susceptibility of EBM Ti-6Al-4V in as-build condition and after HIP heat treatment . 
Microstructure and phase identifications were examined by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and X-ray diffraction analysis . 
Corrosion performance was evaluated by electrochemical measurements , including open-circuit potential ( OCP ) , potentiodynamic polarization analysis and impedance spectroscopy ( EIS ) , as well as stress-corrosion examination in terms of slow strain-rate testing ( SSRT ) . 
All of the corrosion tests were carried out in a 3.5 wt. 
% NaCl solution at ambient temperature . 
Owing to the natural excellent corrosion resistance of Ti-6Al-4V , the obtained results revealed that the HIP process has only a slight positive effect on the corrosion resistance of Ti-6Al-4V produced by EBM . 
This minor improvement may be related to the improved efficiency of the passivation layer that was attributed to the increased β-phase content and the reduction of α/β interfaces . 
In terms of stress corrosion sensitivity , the HIPed specimens exhibited extended time-to-failure ( TTF ) at the low strain rate at 2.5 10-7 1/sec , where the effect of the corrosive environment was more dominant . 
We study linearity assumptions in the transient macroscale mechanical aspect of additive manufacturing ( AM ) process simulation . 
Linearity assumptions are often resorted to in combination with calibrated inelastic deformation components to arrive at computationally tractable yet reasonably accurate AM process models . 
We point out that linearity assumptions permit the independent computation of the response increment in each step of the AM process , and the total mechanical response is the superposition of all the process-step increments . 
In effect , process-step increments are computed with respect to the stress-free reference configuration in each step . 
The implication is that the mechanical response increment in each linearised AM process step may be computed in parallel . 
geometric or material ) is modelled . 
Distortions in Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) Laser Metal Deposition ( LMD ) occur in the newly-built component due to rapid heating and solidification and can lead to shape deviations and cracking . 
Digital Image Correlation ( DIC ) is applied together with optical filters to measure in-situ distortions directly on a wall geometry produced with LMD . 
The wall shows cyclic expansion and shrinking with the edges bending inward and the top of the sample exhibiting a slight u‐shape as residual distortions . 
Subsequently , a structural Finite Element Analysis ( FEA ) of the experiment is established , calibrated against experimental temperature profiles and used to predict the in-situ distortions of the sample . 
A comparison of the experimental and numerical results reveals a good agreement in length direction of the sample and quantitative deviations in height direction , which are attributed to the material model used . 
The suitability of the novel experimental approach for measurements on an AM sample is shown and the potential for the validated numerical model as a predictive tool to reduce trial-and-error and improve part quality is evaluated . 
In this paper we investigate the use of passive stabilization to support stereolithography ( SLA ) printing aboard a moving vessel at sea . 
3D printing is a useful technology onboard a seagoing vessel to support engineering development , shipboard maintenance , and other applications when land-based manufacturing resources are unavailable . 
SLA printed material is particularly suited for underwater applications requiring sealed housings , since SLA printers are capable of producing high-resolution models that are fully solid and impervious to water . 
Hydrostatic pressure can quickly compromise parts created using standard fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) 3D printing . 
However , the dynamic environment onboard a moving vessel could impact the ability of an SLA printer to selectively cure voxels in a liquid resin bath as it undergoes constant motion , and can cause spilling over the walls of the resin tank . 
Using passive stabilization platforms onboard moving research vessels , we successfully printed a number of parts with no discernable differences from those produced in a traditional land-based laboratory . 
As a practical demonstration of this capability , we printed at sea underwater pressure housings that remained sealed to 200 m water depth with functional integrated internal electronics . 
No post-print machining was required to create the sealed housings . 
This work lays the foundation for lithographic 3D printing in seagoing oceanographic and naval applications , and additionally presents an economical approach for producing custom waterproof pressure housings in the field . 
Direct printing of microstructures using material jetting based additive manufacturing ( 3D printing ) onto PMMA substrates . 
Substrate surface free energy contributes to both microstructure resolution and adhesion . 
Surface modification is an effective mechanism to tailor build – substrate interactions . 
The ability to directly print 3D microstructures across the surface of large dimension substrates opens up numerous possibilities not feasible with conventional 2D or 2.5D printing or coating techniques . 
Demonstrated herein is a method to print 3D microstructures onto clear poly ( methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) plates using material jetting technologies . 
Contact angle and profilometry analysis indicated that the VeroCyan™ photopolymer had enhanced wetting of the PMMA surface leading to greater droplet spreading affecting the geometries printed compared to VeroCyan™ integrated models . 
The surface chemistry and wetting behaviour played a crucial role in influencing interfacial interactions with the VeroCyan™ photopolymer hence its adhesion to the PMMA surface . 
Additive manufacturing has facilitated fabrication of complex and patient-specific metallic meta-biomaterials that offer an unprecedented collection of mechanical , mass transport , and biological properties as well as a fully interconnected porous structure . 
However , applying meta-biomaterials for addressing unmet clinical needs in orthopedic surgery requires additional surface functionalities that should be induced through tailor-made coatings . 
Here , we developed multi-functional layer-by-layer coatings to simultaneously prevent implant-associated infections and stimulate bone tissue regeneration . 
We applied multiple layers of gelatin- and chitosan-based coatings containing either bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) -2 or vancomycin on the surface of selective laser melted porous structures made from commercial pure Titanium ( CP Ti ) and designed using a triply periodic minimal surface ( i.e. 
, sheet gyroid ) . 
The additive manufacturing process resulted in a porous structure and met the the design values comparatively . 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra confirmed the presence and composition of the coating layers . 
The osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells was enhanced , as shown by two-fold increase in the alkaline phosphatase activity and up to four-fold increase in the mineralization of all experimental groups containing BMP-2 . 
Eight-week subcutaneous implantation in vivo showed no signs of a foreign body response , while connective tissue ingrowth was promoted by the layer-by-layer coating . 
These results unequivocally confirm the superior multi-functional performance of the developed biomaterials . 
The feasibility of in situ quantitative multielemental analysis during additive manufacturing process has been demonstrated for the first time . 
The specially designed laser induced breakdown spectroscopy ( LIBS ) instrument was equipped the laser cladding head installed at an industrial robot . 
Melt pool surface sampling by LIBS probe was demonstrated to be the only choice for quantitative elemental analysis . 
On-line LIBS quantitative analysis of carbon and tungsten has been demonstrated during the synthesis of wear resistant coatings . 
Online LIBS results were in good agreement with offline analysis by conventional techniques ( EDX , XRF and combustion infrared absorption method ) . 
The feasibility of in situ quantitative multi-elemental analysis during the additive manufacturing process has been demonstrated for the first time using laser induced breakdown spectroscopy ( LIBS ) . 
The coaxial laser cladding technique was utilized for the production of highly wear-resistant coatings ( nickel alloy reinforced with tungsten carbide grains ) . 
High-quality production as well as gradient composition coating synthesis required an online technique for quantitative elemental analysis . 
A low-weight , compact LIBS probe was designed to equip the laser cladding head installed at an industrial robot . 
Hot solidified clad as well as a melt pool surface was sampled by the LIBS probe but meaningful analytical results were achieved only for the latter case due to non-uniform distribution of tungsten carbide grains in the upper surface layer . 
LIBS sampling inside the melt pool did not affect the clad properties according to optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy measurements . 
On-line LIBS quantitative analysis of key components ( carbon and tungsten ) was demonstrated during the synthesis of highly wear-resistant coatings and obtained results were in good agreement with offline analysis performed by electron energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy , X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy , and the combustion infrared absorption method . 
In situ quantitative multielemental analysis by LIBS is a perspective control or/and feedback tool to improve quality of compositionally graded materials in additive manufacturing . 
Our objective herein is to investigate laser-based additive manufacturing to fabricate application-optimized machine-tools that perform comparably to commercially-available products . 
To demonstrate this technology , multi-layer Stellite™ ( Co-Cr-W superalloy ) structures were deposited on a stainless-steel substrate via directed energy deposition technique to be used as a tool for cutting applications requiring high-temperature strength and ductility , an area where conventional carbide and high-speed steel tools are challenged . 
The as-printed structures were free of large-scale defects and voids , and were further characterized and compared to commercial Blackalloy 525 barstock ( B525 ) , a Co-Cr-W alloy tool of similar composition . 
The Stellite™ contained mostly Co-rich ( α-phase ) dendrites , as well as inter-dendritic Cr7C3 and Cr23C6 phases . 
The B525 composition consisted of a range of lamellar-eutectic microstructure comprised of Co-phase with W6C reinforcement . 
During a turning operation of SS304L , the Stellite™ 6 tool demonstrated consistent chip formation and more consistent rake-face and cratering wear in comparison to the B525 tool , indicating its adequacy for service in this application . 
Our results demonstrate for the first time that directed-energy-deposition can be utilized to fabricate advanced cutting tool concepts for job-specific applications . 
The influence of geometry and scan pattern on the microstructure evolution and magnetic performance of additively manufactured Fe-3Si components was investigated . 
To reduce eddy current losses , novel geometries were designed and built and the microstructure and properties of these samples were characterized . 
The laser scan pattern was shown to strongly influence both the as-built grain structure and strength of the crystallographic texture , resulting in measurable changes in the as-built magnetic performance . 
In thin wall samples , heat treatment resulted in an increase in the maximum relative magnetic permeability and decrease in power losses in most samples , consistent with grain growth . 
Compared to simple parallel plate construction and a mesh structure , a novel cross-section design based on the Hilbert space filling curve was found to produce the lowest power losses . 
The mechanisms behind these results were explored using a combination of heat conduction and electromagnetic simulations , providing a route for future component and process optimization . 
In this study , a laser-based additive manufacturing route of selective laser melting ( SLM ) was applied to fabricate carbon nanotubes ( CNTs ) reinforced Al-based nanocomposites with tailored microstructures and excellent mechanical properties . 
The densification behavior , microstructure features and mechanical properties were investigated and the relationship between process and property was established . 
The results showed that the applied laser power and scan speed were the governing factors of the densification behavior of SLM-processed Al-based nanocomposites . 
SLM processing of 0.5 wt. 
% CNTs/AlSi10Mg nanocomposite powder led to the formation of three typical microstructures including the primary Al9Si cellular dendrites decorated with fibrous Si , the in situ Al4C3 covered on CNTs , and the precipitated Si inside the cellular grains . 
As the optimal SLM processing parameters of laser power of 350 W and scan speed of 2.0 m/s were applied , the fully dense SLM-processed CNTs/Al-based nanocomposites exhibited high microhardness of 154.12 HV0.2 , tensile strength of 420.8 MPa and elongation of 8.87 % , due to the formation of high densification and ultrafine microstructure . 
The grain refinement effect , Orowan looping system and load transfer are considered as three strengthening mechanisms occurred simultaneously during tensile tests , leading to excellent mechanical properties of SLM-processed CNTs/Al-based nanocomposites . 
A skeleton sand mold which includes lattice-shell type , rib enforced type and air pockets structure was presented . 
These sand molds can save mold sand and control the time of casting . 
These sand molds make it possible to adjust the cooling and solidification conditions of castings . 
These sand molds can improve production efficiency , and reduce deformation , residual stress and defects of castings . 
The advance of additive manufacturing drives the design of molds for castings . 
The shell forms the cavity for a casting and the surrounding ribs or lattices support and enforce the shell . 
This type of mold structure design results in fast and uniform cooling of a casting , which can improve production efficiency and reduce the deformation and residual stress of a casting . 
In addition , it provides more space and flexibility to adjust the cooling conditions of interested locations of a casting . 
The thickness of the shell can be varied according to the local geometries of a casting . 
The support is designed based on the hydrostatic pressure before solidification and the weight after solidification . 
An air pocket ( hollow structure ) in the shell was designed for the riser to postpone its solidification and then facilitate shrinkage feeding . 
The experimental results revealed that the new design of sand molds saved at least 60 % sand and shortened the shakeout time by at least 20 % . 
Local hollow structure prolonged its solidification process by approximately 15 % . 
For the first time , a method of comparing quantitatively measurement apparatus for additive manufacture is defined . 
Novel instrumentation is subject to this analysis by way of case studies . 
Results allow researchers and industrial users alike to quickly assess the compatibility of an NDE technique with additive manufacturing processes . 
Cs and Ct , the spatial and temporal capability , respectively , are shown to be useful analysis methods for integration feasibility efforts . 
Unlike more established subtractive or constant volume manufacturing technologies , additive manufacturing methods suffer from a lack of in-situ monitoring methodologies which can provide information relating to process performance and the formation of defects . 
In-process evaluation for additive manufacturing is becoming increasingly important in order to assure the integrity of parts produced in this way . 
This paper addresses the generic performance of inspection methods suitable for additive manufacturing . 
Key process and measurement parameters are explored and the impacts these have upon production rates are defined . 
A new method of benchmarking in-situ inspection instruments and characterising their suitability for additive manufacturing processes is presented to act as a design tool to accommodate end user requirements . 
Two inspection examples are presented : spatially resolved acoustic spectroscopy and optical coherence tomography for scanning selective laser melting and selective laser sintering parts , respectively . 
Observations made from the analyses presented show that the spatial capability arising from scanning parameters affects the temporal penalty and hence impact upon production rates . 
A case study , created from simulated data , has been used to outline the spatial performance of a generic nondestructive evaluation method and to show how a decrease in data capture resolution reduces the accuracy of measurement . 
While copper is a potent strengthener in titanium alloys , its use in commercial alloys has been severely restricted due to the strong tendency for segregation during solidification , leading to heterogeneous microstructures and what has often been referred to as the “ beta-fleck ” problem . 
This problem can be largely obviated by using additive manufacturing ( AM ) for processing Ti-Cu alloys . 
This study focuses on AM of a binary Ti-4Cu and a ternary Ti-4Cu-4Al alloy using the laser engineered net shaping ( LENS ) process . 
The influence of post-deposition annealing treatments and the subsequent cooling rate on the microstructure and tensile properties of these alloys has been investigated in detail . 
The phase fraction of the eutectoid alpha + Ti2Cu product is dependent on the cooling rate from above the beta transus temperature . 
Additionally , the Ti2Cu phase exhibited a far-from equilibrium composition in case of the water-quenched Ti-4Cu-4Al alloy . 
Both the yield stress ( ∼550−650 MPa ) as well as the ductility ( ∼15–18 % ) were also higher in case of the ternary alloy . 
The high strengths exhibited by the water-quenched samples of both alloys , while maintaining appreciable tensile ductility , could be attributed to clustering of Cu within the α laths , revealed by atom probe tomography . 
Powder bed fusion additive manufacturing ( AM ) technology , such as electron beam melting ( EBM ) and selective laser melting , has attracted tremendous academic and industrial interests because of its capacity to fabricate components with greater complexity compared with traditional processes , without significantly increasing the cost . 
It provides significantly higher design freedom to the designers and can make the built components closer to the optimum design in theory when compared with traditional processes . 
However , the mechanical performance of the new design fabricated by AM has not been clarified yet . 
Here , we report the fabrication and tensile deformation behavior of the EBM-built lightweight car suspension double wishbone for both conventional and optimized designs . 
EBM process is an effective method to produce a highly-dense Ti-6Al-4V lightweight design component with good reproducibility and fine α/β duplex microstructure . 
A poor mechanical performance in the optimized design is observed , which results from the build thickness-dependent mechanical performance that is caused by both various microstructures and rough surfaces in the Ti-6Al-4V parts . 
Notably , the rough surface plays a dominant role in premature failure when the build thickness is below 2 mm . 
Based on these findings , the degraded mechanical performance in the optimized design is discussed . 
The experimental results and analyses provide a guideline for the design of lightweight structures that are mainly comprised of thin walls and/or struts . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) allows engineers to design and manufacture complex weight saving lattice structures with relative ease . 
A non-destructive testing and evaluation method used to assess material properties and quality is the focus of this paper , namely acoustic resonance ( AR ) testing . 
For this research , AR testing was conducted on weight saving lattice structures ( fine and coarse ) manufactured by powder bed fusion . 
The suitability of AR testing was assessed through a combined approach of experimental testing and FE modelling . 
A sensitivity study was conducted on the FE model to quantify the influence of element coarseness on the resonant frequency prediction and this needs to be taken into account in the application and analysis of the technique . 
The AR and FE modelling modulus of elasticity values were validated using specimens of known properties . 
There was fair agreement between the FE and compression test extracted values of effective modulus for the coarse lattice . 
For the fine lattice , there was agreement in the values of effective modulus extracted from AR , 3-point bend , and compression experimental tests carried out . 
It was found that loose powder fusing from AM resulted in the fine lattice structure having a higher density ( at least 1.5 times greater ) than calculated due to the effect of loose powder adhesion . 
This effect resulted in an increased stiffness of the fine lattice structure . 
AR can be used as a measure of determining loose powder adhesion and other unique structural characteristics resulting from AM . 
Increasing performance requirements of advanced components demands versatile fabrication techniques to meet application-specific needs . 
Composite material processing via laser-based additive manufacturing offers high processing-flexibility and limited tooling requirements to meet this need , but limited information exists on the processing-property relationships for these materials as well as how to exploit them for application-specific needs . 
In this study , Ti/B4C + BN composites are developed for high-temperature applications by designed-incorporation of ceramic reinforcement ( 5 wt % total ) into commercially-pure titanium to form combined particle and in situ reinforcing phases . 
We combine both B4C ( limited reactivity with matrix ) and BN ( high reactivity with matrix ) reinforcements to understand the processing characteristics , in situ phase formations , and combinatorial effect of the multiphase microstructures on thermomechanical properties and high-temperature oxidation resistance . 
Combined reinforcement in this new composite material leads to superior yield strength and wear resistance in comparison to the other compositions and matrix , as well as comparable oxidation characteristics to commercially-developed high temperature titanium alloys , alleviating the need for multiple rare-earth alloying elements that significantly raises costs for manufacturers . 
Tubular structures are fabricated to demonstrate the ease of site-specific composition and dimensional tolerancing using this method . 
Our results indicate that tailored ceramic reinforcement in titanium via laser-based AM could lead to significantly enhanced engineering structures , particularly for developing higher temperature titanium-based materials . 
Previous research on the powder bed fusion electron beam additive manufacturing of Inconel 718 has established a definite correlation between the processing conditions and the solidification microstructure of components . 
However , the direct role of physical phenomena such as fluid flow and vaporization on determining the solidification morphology have not been investigated quantitatively . 
Here we investigate the transient and spatial evolution of the fusion zone geometry , temperature gradients , and solidification growth rates during pulsed electron beam melting of the powder bed with a focus on the role of key physical phenomena . 
The effect of spot density during pulsing , which relates to the amount of heating of the build area during processing , on the columnar-to-equiaxed transition of the solidification structure was studied both experimentally and theoretically . 
Predictions and the evaluation of the role of heat transfer and fluid flow were established using existing solidification theories combined with transient , three-dimensional numerical heat transfer and fluid flow modeling . 
Metallurgical characteristics of the alloy ’ s solidification are extracted from the transient temperature fields , and microstructure is predicted and validated using optical images and electron backscattered diffraction data from the experimental results . 
While conductive heat transfer dominates in the mushy region , both the pool geometry and the solidification parameters are affected by convective heat transfer . 
Finally , increased spot density during processing is shown to increase the time of solidification , lowering temperature gradients and increasing the probability of equiaxed grain formation . 
In this paper we have used laser powder bed fusion ( PBF ) to manufacture and characterize metal microwave components . 
Here we focus on a 2.5 GHz microwave cavity resonator , manufactured by PBF from the alloy AlSi10Mg . 
Of particular interest is its thermal expansion coefficient , especially since many microwave applications for PBF produced components will be in satellite systems where extreme ranges of temperature are experienced . 
We exploit the inherent resonant frequency dependence on cavity geometry , using a number of TM cavity modes , to determine the thermal expansion coefficient over the temperature range 6–450 K. Our results compare well with literature values and show that the material under test exhibits lower thermal expansion when compared with a bulk aluminium alloy alternative ( 6063 ) . 
Metal additive manufacturing is an emerging method to fabricate components used in the aerospace and biomedical industries . 
However , one of the significant challenges in this approach is the surface quality of the fabricated components . 
After metal additive manufacturing operations , post-processing is essential to meet the expected surface quality . 
This study presents the surface characteristics of as-built specimens manufactured by selective laser melting ( SLM ) , where improvement of the surface can be achieved by post-processing operations . 
The post-processing operations in focus are finish machining ( FM ) , vibratory surface finishing ( VSF ) and drag finishing ( DF ) operations . 
Surface topography , average surface roughness , microhardness , microstructure and XRD analysis have been carried out to examine the surface characteristics resulting from the post-processing operations . 
This study demonstrates that the drag finishing operation can be used for post-processing to meet the surface quality requirement of SLM manufactured parts . 
In-process deformation methods such as rolling can be used to refine the large columnar grains that form when wire + arc additively manufacturing ( WAAM ) titanium alloys . 
Due to the laterally restrained geometry , application to thick walls and intersecting features required the development of a new ‘ inverted profile ’ roller . 
A larger radii roller increased the extent of the recrystallised area , providing a more uniform grain size , and higher loads increased the amount of refinement . 
Electron backscatter diffraction showed that the majority of the strain is generated toward the edges of the rolled groove , up to 3 mm below the rolled surface . 
These results will help facilitate future optimisation of the rolling process and industrialisation of WAAM for large-scale titanium components . 
In this contribution , a simplified macroscopic and semi-analytical thermal analysis of directed energy deposition ( DED ) is presented to obtain computationally efficient simulations of the entire process . 
Solidification and solid-state phase transitions are taken into account . 
The model is derived for laser metal powder directed energy deposition , although it can be simply adapted for other focused thermal energy ( e.g. 
, electron beam , or plasma arc ) . 
The gas flow used for carrying the powder significantly influences cooling conditions , which is included in the model . 
The proposed simulation strategy applies to multilayer composites with a wide range of shapes in the horizontal plane and arbitrary laser scanning strategies ( continuous way , back and forth , etc. ) 
. 
The proposed work provides a simple tool to study the influence of most process parameters , design in situ experiments and in turn develop optimization loops to reach material requirements and specific microstructures . 
In situ pyrometer measurements have been compared to the model , and good agreement has been observed with 2.6 % error in average . 
The model is used to demonstrate the effect of various process parameters for a simple cylindrical geometry and a more complex auxetic cell . 
Additive manufacturing using nanoparticles ( NPs ) is a growing field due to the ever-increasing demand for parts with smaller and smaller features . 
Of particular interest are copper nanoparticles ( Cu NPs ) due to the ubiquitous use of Cu in microelectronics applications . 
There are numerous methods currently available to synthesize Cu NPs in both powder and ink forms . 
However , the effect of how the NPs are manufactured on the sintering properties of the NPs produced is not well understood . 
This paper shows that NP size , morphology , and synthesis method can have a significant effect on the sintering temperature and sintering quality for Cu NPs . 
In addition , surface coatings and surfactants used in Cu NP inks can help to reduce agglomeration in the dried NP samples , prevent oxidation of the Cu NPs , and restrict the sintering of the Cu NPs at lower temperatures due to the need to thermally remove the surface coatings before sintering can occur . 
Therefore , these coatings improve the Cu NP packing density and increase the temperature required for necking to occur which leads to better sintering of the Cu NP ink samples . 
It is also observed in this paper that most of these surface coatings are removed during the sintering processes leaving the sintered parts with a much higher Cu percentage than contained in the original NPs . 
However , at temperatures near the melting temperature of the Cu NPs , the surface coatings can start to graphitize and hinder the fusion of the NPs . 
Therefore , the optimal sintering conditions for Cu NP inks are at temperature high enough to break down the polymer surface coating on the NPs but low enough that the Cu NPs do not start to melt and that graphitizing of the surface coatings does not start to occur . 
In the present study , 420 stainless steel parts with different porosities in the range of ∼6 % to ∼ 54 % were fabricated via the binder jet printing technology followed by pre-sintering between 1000 and 1400 °C . 
Initially , during the pre-sintering at 1150 °C , evidences of neck formation between the 420 stainless steel particles were observed . 
Later , when pre-sintered at higher temperature between 1300 and 1350 °C , the parts were found with 3D interconnected open-porous channels . 
Finally , pre-sintering at 1400 °C led to closed/isolated pores within the parts . 
Subsequent bronze infiltration into the as-built ( without pre-sintering ) and pre-sintered ( < 1350 °C ) 420 stainless steel parts with open porous channels were carried out successfully and their corresponding microstructures and mechanical properties were presented and discussed . 
Relatively more uniform bronze infiltration was able to be achieved for the parts pre-sintered between 1300 and 1350 °C due to the presence of 3D interconnected open-porous channels . 
When compared to the as-built parts , the combination of pre-sintering at 1350 °C and subsequent bronze infiltration led to a significant increase in the tensile properties exhibiting a maximum tensile yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of ∼ 647 and ∼ 1053 MPa , respectively . 
The fractured surfaces indicated a typical brittle mode of fracture with cleavages on the 420 stainless steel matrix whereas dimples and ridges were observed within the bronze phase . 
Characterization of the local deformation of the microstructure of 316L stainless steel single-track thickness walls . 
EBSD and DIC analysis of material elements under in situ SEM tensile loading . 
Crystallographic morphology and texture aligned with heat flow pattern induced by printing strategy . 
Statistical analysis of morphology and strain patterns for small and large grains . 
Relationship between grain 's morphology , strain patterns and anisotropy of macroscopic behavior . 
In additive manufacturing , the process parameters have a direct impact on the microstructure of the material and consequently on the mechanical properties of the manufactured parts . 
The purpose of this paper is to explore this relation by characterizing the local microstructural response via in situ tensile test under a scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) combined with high resolution digital image correlation ( HR-DIC ) and Electron Backscatter Diffraction ( EBSD ) maps . 
The specimens under scrutiny were extracted from bidirectionally-printed single-track thickness 316L stainless steel walls built by directed energy deposition . 
The morphologic and crystallographic textures of the grains were characterized by statistical analysis and associated with the particular heat flow pattern of the process . 
Grains were sorted according to their size into large columnar grains located within the printed layer and small equiaxed grains located at the interfaces between successive layers . 
In situ tensile experiments were performed with a loading direction either perpendicular or along the printing direction and exhibit different mechanisms of deformation . 
A statistical analysis of the average deformation per grain indicates that for a tensile loading along the building direction , small grains deform less than the large ones . 
In addition , HR-DIC combined with EBSD maps showed strain localization situated at the interface between layers in the absence of small grains either individual or in clusters . 
For tensile loads along the printing direction , the strain localization was present in several particular large grains . 
These observations permit to justify the differences in yield and ultimate strength noticed during macroscopic tensile tests for both configurations . 
Moreover , they indicate that an optimization of the process parameters could trigger the control of microstructure and consequently the macroscopic mechanical behavior . 
Strategies for fabricating iron-based materials with high strength and ductility are rare despite intense research efforts within the last decades . 
This study provides a novel approach to achieve the synthesis of highly strong and ductile iron-based composites reinforced with a high weight fraction of WC particles ( 20 wt % ) utilizing laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) as processing technique . 
Thereby , the LPBF-fabricated composite material has a multi-phase microstructure consisting of ductile austenite ( main phase ) , highly strong martensite and carbidic precipitations extending across different length-scales . 
The precipitation of ( Fe , W ) 3C type carbide at the Fe/WC interface is well controlled . 
Thus , a very thin reaction layer ( < 500 nm ) forms between the WC particles and iron-based matrix . 
These iron-based composites synthesized by LPBF show an excellent compressive strength of about 2833 MPa and large fracture strain of about 32 % . 
The following mechanisms contribute to the improved mechanical properties : ( 1 ) multiphase material system , ( 2 ) grain refinement , ( 3 ) substructures , ( 4 ) coherent multiscale interfaces and ( 5 ) nano-precipitations . 
Laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) is a proven additive manufacturing ( AM ) technology for producing metallic components with complex shapes using layer-by-layer manufacture principle . 
However , the fabrication of crack-free high-performance Ni-based superalloys such as Hastelloy X ( HX ) using LPBF technology remains a challenge because of these materials ’ susceptibility to hot cracking . 
This paper addresses the above problem by proposing a novel method of introducing 1 wt. 
% titanium carbide ( TiC ) nanoparticles . 
The findings reveal that the addition of TiC nanoparticles results in the elimination of microcracks in the LPBF-fabricated enhanced HX samples ; i.e . 
the 0.65 % microcracks that were formed in the as-fabricated original HX were eliminated in the as-fabricated enhanced HX , despite the 0.14 % residual pores formed . 
It also contributes to a 21.8 % increase in low-angle grain boundaries ( LAGBs ) and a 98 MPa increase in yield strength . 
The study revealed that segregated carbides were unable to trigger hot cracking without sufficient thermal residual stresses ; the significantly increased subgrains and low-angle grain boundaries played a key role in the hot cracking elimination . 
These findings offer a new perspective on the elimination of hot cracking of nickel-based superalloys and other industrially relevant crack-susceptible alloys . 
The findings also have significant implications for the design of new alloys , particularly for high-temperature industrial applications . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) has the potential to construct complex geometries through the simple and highly repetitive process of layer-by-layer deposition . 
The process is repetitive and fully automated , but the interactions between layers during deposition are tightly coupled . 
To unravel these interactions , the computational models of the manufacturing process are critically needed . 
However , current state-of-the-art physics-based models are computationally demanding and can not be used for any realistic optimization . 
To address this challenge , we built a surrogate model ( SM ) of thermal profiles that significantly reduced the computational cost . 
We built this model based on the observation that any AM process exhibits a high level of redundancy and periodicity , making it an ideal problem for machine learning and surrogate modeling.We introduced a unique geometry representation that is the key insight for this work . 
Rather than directly using the part geometry , we directly use the GCode and translate it into a set of features ( local distances from heat sources , e.g. 
, extruder , and sinks , e.g. 
, cooling surfaces ) . 
This set of features is directly used as an input for the SM of thermal history . 
Since this set can be calculated a priori from GCode , the explicit geometry considerations are largely factored out . 
Moreover , we leveraged the analytical solution to the moving heat source model to determine heat influence zone ( HIZ ) . 
We showed that for fused filament fabrication , the size of HIZ is small ; thus , the number of input variables for the SM is small as well.To build the SM , we first generated the thermal data using a physics-based model and use it to train an artificial neural network model . 
We trained the SM and demonstrate its high predictive power and low computational cost . 
With such performance , this model opens the possibility of optimization as well as process planning , and in situ monitoring for closed-loop control . 
In the context of additive manufacturing , there is an exponential use of thermoplastic materials in the industrial and public open-source additive manufacturing sector , leading to an increase in global polymer consumption and waste generation . 
However , the coupling of the open-source 3D printers with polymer processing could potentially offer the basis for a new paradigm of distributed recycling process . 
It could be a complementary alternative to the traditional paradigm of centralized recycling of polymers , which is often uneconomical and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy . 
In order to achieve this goal , a first step is to prove the technical feasibility to recycle thermoplastic material intended for open-source 3D printing feedstock.The contribution of the present study is twofold : first , a general methodology to evaluate the recyclability of thermoplastics used as feedstock in open-source 3D printing machines is proposed . 
Then , the proposed methodology is applied to the recycling study of polylactic acid ( PLA ) material addressed to the fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) technique , which is currently the most widely used . 
The main results of this application contribute to the understanding of the influence of the material 's physico-chemical degradation on its mechanical properties as well as its potential distributed recyclability . 
Additively manufactured internal lattice structures offer a unique approach to lightweight components and adding multi-functionality . 
Design methods for parts based on lattices are emerging and include a family of topology optimization schemes for tailoring local cell density to service loadings . 
In order to gain confidence , these methods must be validated in a controlled manner . 
In this paper , we report optimization , analysis , manufacturing , and mechanical test validation of a casing-like test article . 
The test article was optimized using a stress-based homogenized topology optimization approach and achieved a 53 % weight reduction versus a solid , fully-dense casing with the same form factor . 
The optimized geometry was studied with high-fidelity finite element analysis and then additively manufactured . 
Mechanical testing was performed and demonstrated good correlation between the homogenized finite element model used for optimization , the high-fidelity finite element model , and experimental results . 
The findings validate the optimization approach for the particular use and load case and start to build confidence in the approach as an accepted method . 
This work explores the feasibility of using the Abrasive Fluidized Bed ( AFB ) method to finish flat AlSi10Mg substrates manufactured by Direct Metal Laser Sintering ( DMLS ) . 
Finishing was performed by rotating the substrates inside a fluidized bed of abrasives at high speeds . 
The interaction between the fluidized abrasives and AlSi10Mg substrates has been investigated to analyze the influence of the operational parameters , namely , abrasive type and rotational speed , on the finishing performance . 
The morphological features of the substrates and geometrical tolerances have been inspected by field emission gun–scanning electron microscopy ( FEG–SEM ) and contact gauge profilometry . 
After short finishing cycles , the substrates featured a smoother surface morphology , while the edges were only influenced slightly by the abrasive impacts . 
Abrasive Fluidized Bed ( AFB ) can therefore be considered a potential easy-to-automate , low cost , low time consuming and sustainable finishing technology for metal parts obtained through additive manufacturing . 
A texture prediction method was proposed for epitaxial columnar grains in SLM . 
The texture prediction method was combined with the melt pool prediction . 
Process and microstructure were linked quantitatively for the metal SLM AM process . 
Texture evolution with the number of layers for SLM AlSi10Mg was simulated . 
The simulated texture showed pattern and intensity similar to experiment results . 
Metal additive manufacturing ( AM ) such as selective laser melting ( SLM ) has the powerful capability to produce very different microstructural features , hence different mechanical properties in metals using the same feedstock material but different values of process parameters . 
The lack of a reliable theoretical model of the processing-microstructure relationship of AM material is preventing AM technology from being widely adopted by the manufacturing community . 
Hence , the goal of this work is to establish the link between the microstructure ( texture ) and the process parameters ( laser power , scanning speed , preheat and scanning strategy ) of a metal SLM process . 
To achieve the above goal , a quantitative semi-empirical method is proposed to predict the texture of the epitaxial columnar grains grown from polycrystal substrates . 
Combined with the melt pool prediction by the Rosenthal solution , the processing and microstructure were linked together quantitatively . 
The proposed method is used to estimate the texture evolution with the number of layers for EOS-DMLS-processed AlSi10Mg ( unidirectional scanning direction in one layer and no rotation of scanning direction between layers ) . 
The texture reaches a steady state after five layers , and the steady state texture has similar pattern and intensity to that obtained from the experiment using the same process parameter values and scanning strategy . 
The severe thermal gradients associated with selective laser melting ( SLM ) additive manufacturing ( AM ) generate large residual stresses ( RS ) that geometrically distort and otherwise alter the performance of printed parts . 
Despite broad research interest in this field , it has remained challenging to measure warpage in general as well as RS distributions in situ , which has obfuscated the mechanisms of stress formation during the printing process . 
In pursuit of this goal , we have developed a non-destructive framework for RS measurement in SLM parts using three-dimensional digital image correlation ( 3D-DIC ) to capture in situ surface distortion . 
A two-dimensional analytical model was developed to convert DIC surface curvature measurements to estimates of in-plane residual stresses . 
Experimental validation using stainless steel 316 L “ inverted-cone ” parts demonstrated that residual stress varied across the surface of the printed part , and strongly interacted with the component geometry . 
The 3D-DIC based RS measurements were validated by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , with an average error of 6 % between measured and analytically derived stresses . 
Systematic variation in RS was attributed to the sector-based laser raster strategy , which was supported by complementary finite element calculations . 
Calculations showed that the heterogeneous RS distribution in the parts emerged from the sequential re-heating and cooling of the new surface , and changed dynamically between layers . 
The unique DIC based RS methodology brings substantial benefits over alternatively proposed in situ AM RS measurements , and should facilitate enhanced process optimization and understanding leading towards AM part qualification . 
The interior porous defects formed during the layer-by-layer fabrication process have attracted increasing attention for different additive manufacturing ( AM ) techniques and are regarded as a crucial factor affecting the overall performance . 
In this work , aiming at the cold spray Ti6Al4V bulk materials , the hot isostatic pressing ( HIP ) treatment is adopted to reduce the interior defects , adjust the microstructure , and improve the mechanical properties . 
To characterize the pore morphologies and porosity evolution , the CS Ti6Al4V sample is characterized by optical microscopy and X-ray computed tomography ( XCT ) . 
The 3D reconstructions by XCT show that the fully dense Ti6Al4V alloy can be obtained through the high temperature diffusion and high pressure compacting of the HIP sample . 
After the HIP treatment , the severely deformed grains experience an obvious growth with the uniformly distributed β precipitates around equiaxed α grains . 
The tensile test shows that the strength of CS Ti6Al4V alloys can be largely improved by the enhanced diffusion and resultant metallurgical bonding . 
With the HIP treatment , the CS samples exhibit highly densified morphology and adjusted microstructure that can benefit the improvement of mechanical properties . 
A number of strategies that enable lattice structures to be derived from Topology Optimisation ( TO ) results suitable for Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) are presented . 
The proposed strategies are evaluated for mechanical performance and assessed for AM specific design related manufacturing considerations . 
Results from Finite Element ( FE ) analysis for the two loading scenarios considered : intended loading , and variability in loading , provide insight into the solution optimality and robustness of the design strategies . 
Lattice strategies that capitalised on TO results were found to be considerably ( ∼40–50 % ) superior in terms of specific stiffness when compared to the structures where this was not the case . 
The Graded strategy was found to be the most desirable from both the design and manufacturing perspective . 
The presented pros-and-cons for the various proposed design strategies aim to provide insight into their suitability in meeting the challenges faced by the AM design community . 
Accompanying the increasing advances and interest in Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) technologies is an increasing demand for an industrial workforce that is knowledgeable about the technologies and how to apply them to solve real-world problems . 
As a step towards addressing this knowledge gap , a workshop was held at the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) to discuss the educational needs to prepare industry for AM and its use in different fields . 
The workshop participants – 66 representatives from academia , industry , and government – identified several key educational themes : ( 1 ) AM processes and process/material relationships , ( 2 ) engineering fundamentals with an emphasis on materials science and manufacturing , ( 3 ) professional skills for problem solving and critical thinking , ( 4 ) design practices and tools that leverage the design freedom enabled by AM , and ( 5 ) cross-functional teaming and ideation techniques to nurture creativity . 
First , ensure that all AM curricula provide students with an understanding of ( i ) AM and traditional manufacturing processes to enable them to effectively select the appropriate process for product realization ; ( ii ) the relationships between AM processes and material properties ; and ( iii ) “ Design for AM ” , including computational tools for AM design as well as frameworks for process selection , costing , and solution generation that take advantage of AM capabilities . 
Second , establish a national network for AM education that , by leveraging existing “ distributed ” educational models and NSF ’ s Advanced Technology Education ( ATE ) Programs , provides open source resources as well as packaged activities , courses , and curricula for all educational levels ( K-Gray ) . 
Fourth , provide support for collaborative and community-oriented maker spaces that promote awareness of AM among the public and provide AM training programs for incumbent workers in industry and students seeking alternative pathways to gain AM knowledge and experience . 
The dynamic tensile properties of additively manufactured ( AM ) and cast Al-10Si-Mg alloy were investigated using high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging coupled with a modified Kolsky bar apparatus . 
A controlled tensile loading ( strain rate ≈ 750 s−1 ) was applied using the Kolsky bar apparatus and the deformation and fracture behavior were recorded using the high-speed X-ray imaging setup . 
The synchrotron X-ray computed tomography ( CT ) and high-speed imaging results worked together to identify the location of the critical flaw and to capture the dynamics of crack propagation . 
In all experiments , the critical flaw was located on the surface of each specimen . 
The AM specimens showed significantly higher crack propagation speed , yield strength , ultimate tensile strength , strain hardening coefficient , and yet lower ductility compared to the cast specimens under dynamic tension . 
Although the strength values were higher for the AM specimens , the critical mode I stress intensity factors were comparable for both specimens . 
The microstructures of the samples were characterized by CT and scanning electron microcopy . 
The correlation between the dynamic fracture behavior of the samples and the microstructure of the samples is analyzed and discussed . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) is uniquely suitable for healthcare applications due to its design flexibility and cost effectiveness for creating complex geometries . 
Successful arthroplasty requires integration of the prosthetic implant with the bone to replace the damaged joint . 
Bone-mimetic biomaterials are utilised due to their mechanical properties and porous structure that allows bone ingrowth and implant fixation . 
The predictability of predetermined interconnected porous structures produced by AM ensures the required shape , size and properties that are suitable for tissue ingrowth and prevention of the implant loosening . 
The quality of the manufacturing process needs to be established before the utilisation of the parts in healthcare . 
This paper demonstrates a novel examination method of acetabular hip prosthesis cups based on X-ray computed tomography ( CT ) and image processing . 
The method was developed based on an innovative hip prosthesis acetabular cup prototype with a prescribed non-uniform lattice structure forming struts over the surface , with the interconnected porosity encouraging bone adhesion . 
This non-destructive , non-contact examination method can provide information of the interconnectivity of the porous structure , the standard deviation of the size of the pores and struts , the local thickness of the lattice structure in its size and spatial distribution . 
Fatigue limit of L-PBF maraging steels was characterized by infrared thermography . 
Different manufacturing strategies led to varying fatigue limit values . 
Printing process optimization with respect to fatigue performance can be envisaged . 
This paper deals with the fatigue performance of maraging steels manufactured by Powder Bed Fusion using a laser beam ( L-PBF ) . 
The objective of the study was to develop a method for the rapid and reliable characterization of the produced material ’ s fatigue limit using infrared ( IR ) thermography . 
Next , fatigue tests instrumented by IR camera were processed using heat source reconstruction to measure the mechanical dissipation due to fatigue damage . 
A statistical model was then proposed to identify the fatigue limit of the material . 
Finally , a practical application was performed to compare different manufacturing strategies using the same powder , opening perspectives for the rapid optimization of the printing process with respect to the fatigue performance of the parts produced . 
Magnetically isotropic bonded magnets with a high loading fraction of 70 vol. 
% Nd-Fe-B are fabricated via an extrusion-based additive manufacturing , or 3D printing system that enables rapid production of large parts . 
The density of the printed magnet is ∼ 5.2 g/cm3 . 
The as-printed magnets are then coated with two types of polymers , both of which improve the thermal stability as revealed by flux aging loss measurements . 
Tensile tests performed at 25 °C and 100 °C show that the ultimate tensile stress ( UTS ) increases with increasing loading fraction of the magnet powder , and decreases with increasing temperature . 
AC magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements show that the 3D printed Nd-Fe-B bonded magnets exhibit extremely low eddy current loss and high resistivity . 
Finally , we demonstrate the performance of the 3D printed magnets in a DC motor configuration via back electromotive force measurements . 
During solidification of many so-called high-performance engineering alloys , such as 6000 and 7000 series aluminum alloys , which are also unweldable autogenously , volumetric solidification shrinkage and thermal contraction produces voids and cracks . 
During additive manufacturing processing , these defects can span the length of columnar grains , as well as intergranular regions . 
In this research , laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) of aluminum alloy ( AA ) 6061 used powder bed heating at 500 °C in combination with other experimentally determined processing parameters to produce crack-free components . 
In addition , melt-pool banding , which is a normal solidification feature in LPBF , was eliminated , illustrating solidification process modification as a consequence of powder bed heating . 
Corresponding microindentation hardness and tensile testing of the as-fabricated AA6061 components indicated an average Vickers hardness of HV 54 , and tensile yield , ultimate strength , and elongation values of 60 MPa , 130 MPa , and 15 % , respectively . 
These mechanical properties and those of heat treated parts showed values comparable to annealed and T6 heat treated wrought products , respectively . 
X-ray diffraction and optical microscopy revealed columnar grain growth in the build direction with the as-fabricated , powder-bed heated product microstructure characterized by [ 100 ] textured , elongated grains ( ∼ 25 μm wide by 400 μm in length ) , and both intragranular and intergranular , noncoherent Al-Si-O precipitates which did not contribute significantly to the mechanical properties . 
The results of this study are indicative that powder bed heating may be used to assist with successful fabrication of AA6061 and other alloy systems susceptible to additive manufacturing solidification cracking . 
Recent developments in additive manufacturing ( AM ) technologies involving heat and mass deposition have exposed the need for computationally efficient modeling of thermal field histories . 
This is due to the effect of such histories on resulting morphologies and quantities of interest , such as micro- and meso-structure , residual strains and stresses , as well as on material and structural properties and associated functional performance at the macro-scale . 
Consequently , in this paper , analytic solutions are enriched and then used to model the thermal aspects of AM , in a manner that demonstrates both high computational performance and fidelity required to enable “ in the loop ” use for feedback control of AM processes . 
It is first shown that the utility of existing analytical solutions is limited due to their underlying assumptions , some of which are their derivation based on a homogeneous semi-infinite domain and temperature independent material properties among others . 
These solutions must therefore be enriched in order to capture the actual thermal physics associated with the relevant AM processes . 
Enrichments introduced herein include the handling of strong nonlinear variations in material properties due to their dependence on temperature , finite non-convex solution domains , behavior of heat sources very near domain boundaries , and mass accretion coupled to the thermal problem . 
Design for additive manufacturing ( AM ) requires knowledge of the constraints associated with your targeted AM process . 
One important design concern is the unintentional trapping of parasitic mass in occluded void geometries with either uncured or non-solidified material , or in some cases , sacrificial support material . 
These occluded features create the need to physically alter the optimal topology to remove the material . 
In this work , a projection-based topology optimization design formulation is proposed to eliminate occluded void topological features in optimal AM designs . 
The algorithm is based on the combination and enhancement of two existing algorithms : a projection-based , overhang-constrained algorithm to design self-supporting structures in AM , and a void projection algorithm to design topologies through control of the void phase . 
The combined algorithm results in topologies with void regions that always possess an exit path to predefined outer surfaces – i.e . 
Solutions are first demonstrated in two dimensions , with increasing design freedom allowed through algorithm enhancements . 
The algorithm is then adapted to 3D , adopting a multi-phase TO approach to not only regain control of the solid phase length scale , but also to drive toward superior performing topologies with minimal impact on the part performance . 
Steel – Inconel multi-scale multilayer by liquid metal dispersed powder bed fusion . 
Nano-scale microstructural design by reactive additive manufacturing . 
Gradients of microstructure , texture , residual stresses and chemical composition . 
Zig-zag columnar grains , grain boundaries and crack formation . 
Multi-scale correlative characterization of additively manufactured gradient structures . 
Synthesis of multi-metal hybrid structures with narrow heat affected zones , limited residual stresses and secondary phase occurrence represents a serious scientific and technological challenge . 
In this work , liquid dispersed metal powder bed fusion was used to additively manufacture a multilayered structure based on alternating Inconel 625 alloy ( IN625 ) and 316L stainless steel ( 316L ) layers on a 316L base plate . 
Analytical scanning and transmission electron microscopies , high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction and nanoindentation analysis reveal sharp compositional , structural and microstructural boundaries between alternating 60 μm thick alloys ’ sub-regions and unique microstructures at macro- , micro- and nano-scales . 
The periodic occurrence of IN625 and 316L sub-regions is correlated with a cross-sectional hardness increase and decrease and compressive stress decrease and increase , respectively . 
The laser scanning strategy induced a growth of elongated grains separated by zig-zag low-angle grain boundaries , which correlate with the occurrence of zig-zag cracks propagating in the growth direction . 
The occurrence of the C-like stress gradient with a pronounced surface tensile stress of about 500 MPa is interpreted by the temperature gradient mechanism model . 
Chemical analysis indicates a formation of reinforcing spherical chromium-metal-oxide nano-dispersoids and demonstrates a possibility for reactive additive manufacturing and microstructural design at the nanoscale , as a remarkable attribute of the deposition process . 
Finally , the study shows that the novel approach represents an effective tool to combine dissimilar metallic alloys into unique bionic hierarchical microstructures with possible synergetic properties . 
Binder jetting ( BJ ) is a high build-rate additive manufacturing process with growing commercial interest . 
Growth in BJ applications is driven by the use of finer powders and improved post-processing methods that can produce dense , homogenous final parts . 
This paper considers the impact of in-process drying , part geometry , and droplet size on a key printing parameter : binder saturation . 
Parts of varying thicknesses are printed with a range of saturation levels under various heating conditions . 
In unheated powder beds , part mass increases linearly with printing saturation levels across the range tested ( 30 % –130 % ) . 
However , when the powder is heated between layers , there is a wide range of print saturation levels ( 30–80 % ) over which increasing binder saturation or droplet volume does not increase the part mass . 
This stable part mass corresponds to accurate part geometries without bleeding and is likely due to enhanced evaporation of the binder solvent between layers . 
Smaller droplet volume ( 42 pl ) was also shown to decrease saturation levels in unheated powder bed and in single layer parts . 
The differences in part mass with print saturation and droplet volume are most pronounced in thin parts . 
These observations lead to a simple method for determining an appropriate print saturation parameter for a powder/binder combination in thick parts . 
Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) is widely gaining popularity as an alternative manufacturing technique for complex and customised parts . 
AM materials are used for various medical applications in both metal and polymer options . 
Adenosine Triphosphate ( ATP ) bioluminescence technology is a rapid , user-friendly method of quantifying surface cleanliness and was used in this study to gather quantitative data on levels of contamination on AM materials at three different stage processes : post build , post cleaning and post sterilization . 
The surface cleanliness of eleven AM materials , three metals and eight polymers , was tested . 
ATP bioluminescence provided the sensitivity to evaluate different material surface characteristics , and specifically the impact of surface finishing techniques on overall cleanliness . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) provides flexibility in creating novel metal-matrix composites ( MMCs ) with unique microstructures and enhanced mechanical properties over conventionally manufactured MMGs . 
In this study , a Zr-based metallic glass ( MG ) decorated Ti6Al4V ( Ti64 ) composite with a unique hybrid nanostructure and enhanced mechanical properties and wear resistance was fabricated using SLM . 
The results revealed that a near-full dense and crack-free Ti-based composite was produced , with its reinforcements consisting of ultrafine β dendrites set with partially crystallized MG nanobands uniformly distributed along the boundaries of the melt pool . 
The addition of MG significantly affected the solidification behavior of the Ti-liquid because of its higher dynamic viscosity and density as well as compositional effect on the phase stability . 
With such a unique nanostructured reinforcement , the Ti64/MG composite exhibited an enhanced yield strength ( > 1 GPa ) with reasonable ductility and fracture toughness . 
On the basis of the result of a theoretical analysis , we attributed the main strengthening mechanism to Orowan strengthening . 
The wear resistance was also much improved in the Ti64/MG composite , arising from the higher hardness of the nanostructured reinforcement and the formation of a more protective tribo-oxide layer during sliding . 
The confinement of the 3D distributed reinforcement phase played a crucial role in preventing the delamination of the tribo-layer on the matrix . 
This work opens a pathway to the design of novel additively manufactured MMCs with outstanding mechanical properties . 
Fatigue of laser beam powder bed fused ( LB-PBF ) 316 L stainless steel is investigated . 
Effects of build orientation and surface roughness are examined . 
Fractography and failure analysis on fatigue specimens are conducted . 
A fracture mechanics-based approach is employed to explain the fatigue results . 
The effects of layer orientation and surface roughness on the mechanical properties and fatigue life of 316L stainless steel ( SS ) fabricated via a laser beam powder bed fusion ( LB-PBF ) additive manufacturing process were investigated . 
Quasi-static tensile and uniaxial fatigue tests were conducted on LB-PBF 316L SS specimens fabricated in vertical and diagonal directions in their as-built surface condition , as well as in horizontal , vertical , and diagonal directions where the surface had been machined to remove any effects of surface roughness . 
Similarly , in the as-built condition , vertical specimens demonstrated better fatigue resistance when compared to diagonal specimens . 
Furthermore , the detrimental effects of surface roughness on fatigue life of LB-PBF 316L SS specimens was not significant , which may be due to the presence of large internal defects in the specimens . 
Anisotropy of LB-PBF 316L SS specimens was attributed to the variation in layer orientation , affecting defects ’ directionality with respect to the loading direction . 
These defect characteristics can significantly influence the stress concentration and , consequently , fatigue behavior of additive manufactured parts . 
Therefore , the elastic-plastic energy release rates , a fracture mechanics-based concept that incorporates size , location , and projected area of defects on the loading plane , were determined to correlate the fatigue data and acceptable results were achieved . 
As-built microstructure of L-PBF AM consists of fine dendrites and precipitates . 
Precipitates comprise mostly Laves phase and small amount of NbC carbide . 
Uniformly distributed hardness for samples built with and without support . 
Calculations show heat build-up of 487 K with support versus 353 K without support . 
Solidification cooling rate 6.57 × 105 K/s with support versus 8.45 × 105 K/s without . 
INCONEL® 718 cubes with and without structural support were built by laser-powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) additive manufacturing . 
The effect of support on the as-built microstructure was studied based on the microstructural characteristics and micro-hardness variations . 
Specifically , the microstructure was examined by optical microscopy , and scanning and transmission electron microscopy . 
The precipitates were identified via selected area diffraction supplemented by high-resolution energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy . 
Micro-hardness distributions on cross sections parallel and perpendicular to the build direction were mapped . 
In addition , analytical equations , taking into account various laser processing parameters , material properties and support geometries , were developed to calculate the heat build-up and cooling conditions during L-PBF . 
The results of microstructure characterization and analytical calculation showed a marginal effect of the support on the local microstructure and hardness due to the low heat input in L-PBF . 
Moreover , the comprehensive set of microstructure data is useful for future work of modelling processing-microstructure relation as well as optimizing post-fabrication heat treatment . 
The ability to simulate the thermal , mechanical , and material response in additive manufacturing offers tremendous utility for gaining a deeper understanding of the process , while also having significant practical application . 
The approach and progress in establishing an integrated computational system for simulating additive manufacturing of metallic components are discussed , with the primary focus directed at the computational intensive components , which include the process and material models . 
SRAS optical data was used for defect characterisation of an SLM layer . 
A bespoke algorithm was developed to target defects for rework . 
A hatch pattern rework showed to be the most effective method for rework . 
A general framework for targeted rework in AM processes is presented . 
A major factor limiting the adoption of powder-bed-fusion additive manufacturing for production of parts is the control of build process defects and the effect these have upon the certification of parts for structural applications . 
In response to this , new methods for detecting defects and to monitor process performance are being developed . 
However , effective utilisation of such methods to rework parts in process has yet to be demonstrated.This study investigates the use of spatially resolved acoustic spectroscopy ( SRAS ) scan data to inform repair strategies within a commercial selective laser melting machine . 
New methodologies which allow for rework of the most common defects observed in selective laser melting ( SLM ) manufacturing are proposed and demonstrated . 
Three rework methodologies are applied to targeted surface breaking pores : a hatch pattern , a spiral pattern and a single shot exposure . 
The work presented shows that it is possible to correct surface breaking pores using targeted re-melting , reducing the depth of defects whilst minimising changes in local texture . 
This work is part of a programme to develop a method by which defects can be detected and the part reworked in-process during SLM to enable defect specification targets to be met . 
Despite the rapid adoption of laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) Additive Manufacturing by industry , current processes remain largely open-loop , with limited real-time monitoring capabilities . 
While some machines offer powder bed visualization during builds , they lack automated analysis capability . 
This work presents an approach for in-situ monitoring and analysis of powder bed images with the potential to become a component of a real-time control system in an LPBF machine . 
Specifically , a computer vision algorithm is used to automatically detect and classify anomalies that occur during the powder spreading stage of the process . 
Anomaly detection and classification are implemented using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm , operating on a moderately-sized training database of image patches . 
The performance of the final algorithm is evaluated , and its usefulness as a standalone software package is demonstrated with several case studies . 
The mechanical , metallurgical and corrosion properties of Alloy 625 produced using the laser powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) manufacturing process were investigated and compared with typical performance of the alloy produced using conventional forging processes . 
Test specimens were produced near net shape along with several demonstration pieces that were produced to examine the geometric complexity that could be achieved with the process . 
The additively manufactured specimens exhibited strength , fracture toughness and impact toughness that was equal to or better than properties typically achieved for wrought product . 
There was no evidence of stress corrosion cracking susceptibility in 3.5 % NaCl solution at stress intensities up to 70 ksi-in1/2 after 700 h exposure . 
The microstructure was equiaxed in the plane of the powder bed build platform ( X–Y ) and exhibited a columnar shape in the Z direction although there was not any significant evidence of anisotropy in the mechanical properties . 
The high hardness , melting temperature and environmental resistance of most ceramic materials makes them well-suited for propulsion , tribilogical and protective applications . 
However , these same attributes pose difficulties for manufacturing and machining of ceramics and ultimately limit the achievable design space of these materials . 
Recently , a new class of preceramic photopolymers has been developed that enables additive manufacturing of ceramics using commercially available stereolithography systems . 
By consolidating preceramic monomers via layer-wise exposure to ultraviolet light and subsequently pyrolyzing under an inert atmosphere to form a ceramic , this method allows for complex geometry parts that can not be produced with traditional sintering , pressing or vapor infiltration processes . 
To this end , we present x-ray micro-computed tomography ( micro-CT ) measurements of the dimensional stability and uniformity of additively manufactured silicon-based ceramics as a function of geometry and processing conditions . 
Laser polishing ( LP ) is an emerging technique with the potential to be used for post-build , or in-situ , precision smoothing of rough , fatigue-initiation prone , surfaces of additive manufactured ( AM ) components . 
LP uses a laser to re-melt a thin surface layer and smooths the surface by exploiting surface tension effects in the melt pool . 
However , rapid re-solidification of the melted surface layer and the associated substrate thermal exposure can significantly modify the subsurface material . 
This study has used an electron beam melted ( EBM ) Ti6Al4V component , representing the worst case scenario in terms of roughness for a powder bed process , as an example to investigate these issues and evaluate the capability of the LP technique for improving the surface quality of AM parts . 
Experiments have shown that the surface roughness can be reduced to below Sa = 0.51 μm , which is comparable to a CNC machined surface , and high stress concentrating defects inherited from the AM process were removed by LP . 
However , the re-melted layer underwent a change in texture , grain structure , and a martensitic transformation , which was subsequently tempered in-situ by repeated beam rastering and resulted in a small increase in sub-surface hardness . 
In addition , a high level of near-surface tensile residual stresses was generated by the process , although they could be relaxed to near zero by a standard stress relief heat treatment . 
Currently , additive manufacturing is a rapidly growing technique that should be explored for the development of various composites and alloys . 
Graphene is also simultaneously gaining considerable attention as a reinforcement material for metals due to its superior properties . 
In this study , a graphene/AlSi10Mg composite was developed using the powder bed fusion ( PBF ) technique . 
The effect of graphene reinforcement and laser power variation was studied on the basis of the porosity , microstructure and mechanical properties of the composite . 
First , graphene ( 0.1 and 0.2 wt. 
% ) was mixed in AlSi10Mg powder by conducting low-energy ball milling . 
The resultant mixture was used for PBF at laser power values of 200 , 300 and 400 W. The prepared samples were characterised by synchrotron-based X-ray computed tomography to observe their pore distribution and morphology . 
The observation results reveal that the energy ( laser power ) required for appropriate melting of the powder was increased after graphene incorporation . 
Electron backscattered diffraction analysis revealed grain refinement and increase in fraction of high angle grain boundaries due to progressive addition of graphene . 
The strain developed after graphene incorporation was also validated using X-ray diffraction analysis . 
The uniform distribution of graphene and its structural inherency was confirmed by Raman analysis . 
Moreover , transmission electron microscopy revealed a suitable graphene-matrix interface . 
The tensile properties were significantly influenced by the porosity induced in the samples irrespective of graphene reinforcement . 
However , a yield strength increase of 22 % was observed in the composite compared with the strength of unreinforced sample of equivalent density . 
Hardness increased progressively with the graphene content and was unaffected by variation in the laser power . 
Material jetting 3D printing is an additive manufacturing technique that allows producing complex parts without tooling and minimum material wastage . 
In this study , orientation control of randomly shaped , anisotropic hard magnetic ferrite particles is demonstrated for material jetting-based additive manufacturing processes using a developed particle alignment configuration . 
Strontium ferrite and PR-48 photosensitive resin were used as the base materials . 
An automated experimental setup with two neodymium permanent cube magnets capable of generating a dipolar magnetic field was built to align magnetic particles in the resin . 
Particle alignment was characterized for directionality using images obtained through real time optical microscopy . 
The orientation of magnetic particles was observed to be dependent on the distance of separation between the cube magnets and the magnetization time . 
X-ray diffraction was used to indicate the c-axis alignment of the hexagonal strontium ferrite particles in the cured specimens . 
The influence of process parameters on particle orientation was evaluated , employing a full factorial experiment analysis . 
This fundamental research serves as a basis for constructing and optimizing the magnetic particle alignment setup for additive manufacturing processes . 
Measurements of the temperature and distortion evolution during laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) are taken as a function of time . 
In situ measurements have proven vital to the development and validation of FE ( finite element ) models for alternate forms of additive manufacturing . 
Due to powder obscuring all but the top layer of the part in LPBF , many non-contact measurement techniques used for in situ measurement of additive manufacturing processes are impossible . 
Therefore , an enclosed instrumented system is designed to allow for the in situ measurement of temperature and distortion in an LPBF machine without the need for altering the machine or the build process . 
By instrumenting a substrate from underneath , the spread powder does not affect measurements . 
Default processing parameters for the EOS M280 machine prescribe a rotating scan pattern of 67° for each layer . 
One test is completed using the default rotating scan pattern and a second is completed using a constant scan pattern . 
Experimental observations for the build geometry tested showed that for Inconel® 718 and a constant scan pattern produce results in a 37.6 % increase in distortion as compared with a rotated scan pattern . 
The in situ measurements also show that the thermal cycles caused by the processing of a layer can impact the distortion accumulated during the deposition of the previous layers . 
The amount of distortion built per layer between the rotating and constant scan pattern cases highlights inter-layer effects not previously discovered in LPBF . 
The demonstrated inter-layer effects in the LPBF process should be considered in the development of thermo-mechanical models of the LPBF process . 
Increasing demand for high-quality additive manufactured parts in the aerospace , automotive , medical , and oil and gas industries requires careful control of the part microstructure , residual stress , and density homogeneity . 
In order to improve part quality , partial remelting of the as-built material during subsequent beam scans is desirable . 
Here , we make use of computer simulations to explicitly study remelting in laser- or electron beam-melting additive manufacturing . 
By explicitly implementing phase transformations between the powder , the liquid , and the bulk , we track the amount of material that is subject to remelting . 
The influence of the beam parameters , such as the beam size , scan speed and power , are investigated and both the cases of an exponential as well as a linear beam absorption profile are considered . 
We find that , at constant beam cross section , there is an optimal beam shape for remelting . 
Calculations are presented for the model case of AISI 316L stainless steel but can be extended to a wide class of metals . 
Binder jetting technology enables the production of sand casting molds and cores without a pattern . 
Real-time inertial measurement is demonstrated with encapsulated wireless sensors in sand cores . 
In this work , real-time in-process monitoring of core motion in metal castings is demonstrated through the use of two emerging technologies . 
3D sand printing ( 3DSP ) is a binder jetting additive manufacturing process that is quickly manifesting itself as a technological disrupter in the metal casting industry . 
Based on its direct digital manufacturing principle , 3DSP enables complex mold and core design freedom that has been previously unavailable to foundry engineers . 
In addition , the miniaturization and affordability of electronics and sensing equipment is rapidly accelerating . 
An experimental casting and mold were designed in this research to demonstrate and evaluate wireless sensing of core shifts . 
With the use of 3D sand printing , precisely sized and located pockets were manufactured inside of cores . 
Miniature wireless Bluetooth sensors capable of measuring acceleration and rotation were then embedded inside the cores . 
From these , high fidelity data were captured wirelessly from the sensors during the casting process . 
With strategically designed core prints designed to allow varying levels of core motion , it is shown that core shifts can be measured and discriminated during casting in real time . 
The fracture properties ( stress intensity factor and energy release rate ) of additively manufactured ( AM ) polylactic acid ( PLA ) and its short carbon fiber ( CF ) reinforced composites have been studied . 
The effects of CF reinforcement , nozzle geometry and bead lay-up orientations in fracture properties , void contents , and interfacial bonding were investigated . 
The fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) -based AM specimens using both circular and square shaped nozzle were printed and compared with the conventional compression molded ( CM ) samples . 
Compact tension ( CT ) specimens with different CF concentrations ( 0 wt. 
% , 3 wt . 
% , 5 wt. 
% , 7 wt. 
% and 10 wt. 
% ) were printed with two bead lay-up orientations ( 450/-450 and 00/900 ) using PLA and CF/PLA composite filaments . 
The results show significant improvement in fracture toughness and fracture energy for CF/PLA composites in comparison to neat PLA . 
The increase in fracture energy was observed to be about 77 % for 00/900 and 88 % for 450/-450 bead orientations , respectively for the same fiber reinforcement ( 5 wt . 
Such improvement in fracture properties is expected to be higher for all 900 bead orientations . 
The samples printed by square-shaped nozzle showed enhanced fracture toughness with less inter-bead voids and larger bonded areas in comparison to the circular-shaped nozzle . 
Although the fracture toughness showed very negligible differences between 00/900 and 450/-450 specimens , distinguishable variation may be seen in the case of 00 and 900 bead orientations . 
The crack propagation path and fracture mechanisms were studied using optical microscopy ( OM ) and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) examinations . 
Fractography revealed different modes of failure with a very high fiber orientation along the printing direction and a relatively higher void contents for 7 and 10 wt . 
% fiber reinforcement . 
The advent of additive manufacturing ( AM ) , also often referred to as 3D printing , has enabled the rapid production of parts with complex geometries that are either labor-intensive or unrealizable by traditional manufacturing methods . 
Many existing 3D printing technologies , however , only allow one material to be printed at one time , while many applications require the integration of different materials , which sometimes can not be printed by one AM technology . 
In this paper , a novel multi-material multi-method ( m4 ) 3D printer comprised of multiple AM technologies is presented as a solution to the current limitations . 
This printer fosters the advancement of AM by combining materials traditionally unable to be printed concurrently while adding functionality to printed parts . 
The m4 3D printer integrates four AM technologies and two complementary technologies onto one single platform , including inkjet ( IJ ) , fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) , direct ink writing ( DIW ) , and aerosol jetting ( AJ ) , along with robotic arms for pick-and-place ( PnP ) and photonic curing for intense pulsed light ( IPL ) sintering . 
The integration of these AM technologies and PnP into a single platform allows for rapid fabrication of complex devices , providing a wide range of functionalities with applications ranging from soft robotics and flexible electronics to medical devices . 
Magnesium alloys are highly attractive in aerospace and auto industries due to their high strength-to-weight ratio . 
Additive manufacturing of Mg alloys can further save cost from materials and machining time . 
This paper investigates the microstructure and dynamic mechanical behavior of WE-43 Mg alloy built through the powder bed fusion process . 
Samples from four different combinations of processing parameters were built . 
These builds were studied in both as-built and hot isostatically pressed conditions . 
The resultant complex microstructures were studied under scanning and transmission electron microscopes while their dynamic mechanical behavior was evaluated using a split-Hopkinson pressure bar testing system . 
Effects of initial porosity and microstructural evolution during HIP treatment on mechanical response are discussed . 
Any literature investigation of Laser Powder Bed Fusion ( L-PBF ) manufacturing of metal parts would reveal that the development of internal stresses is a serious limitation in the application of this technology . 
Researchers have used a variety of different methods to quantify this stress and investigate scanning strategies aimed at reducing or distributing this stress more evenly in the part . 
These techniques provide a rapid method to give a quantitative comparison of scan strategies and parameters . 
Non-destructive diffraction based methods can be used to calculate the profile of stress in a part but these are often prohibitively expensive or difficult to use on a large scale . 
This study presents a methodology which combines deflection based methods with either the hole drilling or contour methods . 
Results show that these experiments can be completed in a cost effective manner , with standard lab based equipment to generate a through thickness measurement of residual stress . 
To benefit from the fascinating properties of multi-material structures , the interfacial joint should exhibit good mechanical strength . 
Evaluating the shear strength of a bimetallic joint via conventional methods is usually complex , and in most cases produces unreliable data due to induced bending stress among others . 
In this work , a novel single-shear test device was designed and fabricated to measure shear strength of bimetallic joints . 
The device was first standardized by shearing standard materials , and the results were in good agreement with published data . 
Subsequently , the shear strength of Inconel 718/copper alloy ( GRCop-84 ) bimetallic joint built via laser engineered net shaping ( LENS™ ) was evaluated . 
Compression test on the bimetallic joint was carried out as well for more mechanical characterization . 
Both shear and compressive yield strengths of the bimetallic joints were compared with the base materials in addition to influence of thermal cycling on the joint strength . 
Inconel 718/GRCop-84 bimetallic-joint shear strength was 220 ± 18 MPa and 231 ± 27 MPa for as-printed sample and after thermal cycling , respectively . 
Likewise , the bimetallic yield strength after compression test was 232 ± 3 MPa and 337 ± 15 MPa . 
No cracking through or along the interface was observed even after thermal cycling , which indicates no thermal degradation at the bimetallic interfacial joint . 
Increase in compressive yield strength after thermal cycling could be attributed to precipitation of Cr2Nb particles in GRCop-84 matrix along with strengthening due to gamma phases in Inconel 718 . 
Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and backscatter electron imaging were used to examine the interfacial microstructures and failure modes . 
EDS was used as well to analyze the interface elemental composition . 
The development of the single-shear test device can provide an added opportunity to effectively evaluate mechanical behavior , reliability and performance of additively manufactured multi-material structures through bond strength analysis . 
In this work , we develop a simple model to determine the upper bound of feed rates that do not cause jamming in material extrusion additive manufacturing , also known as fused deposition modeling ( FDM ) ™ or fused-filament fabrication ( FFF ) . 
We first derive a relation between the tube temperature and Péclet number for the solid portion of polymer filaments . 
We focus on the boundary between the solid and molten polymer in the heated portion of the tube . 
We find the Péclet number that corresponds to the point at which this boundary makes contact with the nozzle , and identify this as the upper bound of the feed rate . 
We compare our predictions to experimental results . 
We find good agreement for tube temperatures sufficiently above the glass-transition temperature , which is the temperature region of typical additive manufacturing . 
Additive manufacturing potential of cold spray technology was used to fabricate freestanding samples of a copper alloy . 
Different volume fractions of micro and nanocrystalline powder particles were used to obatin a bimodal structure with heterogeneous arrangement of crystalline phases . 
The effects of volume fractions of each phase were investigated on the microstructural arrangement , porosity , microhardness , residual stresses , and mechanical strength of the deposited materials . 
A series of finite element simulations were developed and validated by experimental data to describe the influence of volume fraction , morphology , and spatial distribution of the phases on the global strength of the samples under tensile loading . 
The obtained results evidence the possibility of tailoring the mechanical response of freestanding cold spray deposits , adopting a heterogeneous phase structure . 
Optimized fabrication parameters and post-processing strategies should be studied to further enhance the performance of the designed bimodal materials and overcome the intrinsic brittleness of cold spray deposits . 
In this article , we propose a model that can account for the effect of porosity and high surface roughness on the fatigue crack initiation of AM Ti6Al4V alloys in moderate and high cycle fatigue regimes . 
Within these fatigue regimes , the applied force to the component is below the yield stress , however , defective features , viz. 
, porosity and high surface roughness , can act as stress raisers . 
As a consequence , local plasticity can occur . 
To capture this phenomenon , a nonlinear isotropic kinematic hardening elasto-plasticity model is employed in our finite element ( FE ) model . 
For creating the geometry of the FE models , inputs from fractography analyses and surface roughness measurements are needed . 
From fractography analyses , the shape of pores formed by gas bubbles during manufacture appears quite regular . 
Thus , these pores are modeled as circles in FE models . 
The size of these pores and their distance to a free surface of the tested specimens are extracted from Scanning Electron Microscope images . 
Moreover , it has been mentioned in the literature that statistical parameters of surface roughness can not fully describe the detrimental effect of this type of defect to the fatigue life of the associated component . 
Thus , in our FE model , the surface topography , which was measured using stylus-based profilometer , is explicitly modeled . 
The finite element results are then post-processed by our in-house software to extract the Smith–Watson–Topper ( SWT ) fatigue indicator parameter ( FIP ) . 
The SWT parameter is calculated at each element centroid of the FE mesh , i.e. 
, the local indicator . 
Afterward , an average value of the SWT parameter over a so-called critical area whose center is located at the considered centroid is also calculated , i.e. 
, the average indicator . 
The results show that the local SWT indicator is too conservative in predicting the fatigue life of the AM Ti64 alloys while the average SWT one can provide good results . 
A complete metallurgical and mechanical assessment of additively-manufactured maraging tool steels has been undertaken , beginning with the initial powder and ending at hybrid builds . 
The effect of powder recycling on powder characteristics is investigated using flowability , size distribution , and density measurements . 
Virgin and re-used powder have similar characteristics in terms of size distribution and chemical and phase homogeneity , but no flowability . 
A microstructural characterization of the as-built and heat-treated samples is undertaken , showing the phase evolution , and the formation of porosity between build layers . 
The age-hardening response of the alloy at 490 °C and 650 °C is demonstrated to be similar to the material in the wrought condition . 
Finally , hybrid build scenarios are examined – maraging steel powder deposited onto C300 maraging steel , as well as H13 tool steel substrates – using digital image correlation . 
In both cases , the interface remains coherent without any sign of de-bonding during tensile deformation . 
In the case of the maraging steel powder / C300 substrate , the deformation is homogeneous throughout until failure localizes away from the interface . 
In the case of the maraging steel powder / H13 substrate , the deformation is predominantly within the substrate until failure localizes at the interface . 
A heat treatment strategy for the maraging steel powder / H13 tool steel substrate is proposed . 
The effect of electrode positive time cycle ( % EP ) of the alternating current TIG process has been investigated for aluminium wire + arc additive manufacture of linear walls . 
The study considered the effect on oxide removal , linear wall dimensions , microstructure , mechanical properties as well as the effect on electrode wear . 
Microstructure analysis showed a noticeable increase in the grain size for higher % EP . 
The study also showed that % EP had no significant effect on mechanical properties . 
The study also indicated that there could be other contributing factors to wall dimensions . 
For aluminium wire + arc additive manufacture of linear walls , minimum cleaning ranged between 10 % EP and 20 % EP . 
Reverted austenite is a metastable phase that can be used in maraging steels to increase ductility via transformation-induced plasticity or TRIP effect . 
In the present study , 18Ni maraging steel samples were built by selective laser melting , homogenized at 820 °C and then subjected to different isothermal tempering cycles aiming for martensite-to-austenite reversion . 
Thermodynamic simulations were used to estimate the inter-critical austenite + ferrite field and to interpret the results obtained after tempering . 
In-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction was performed during the heating , soaking and cooling of the samples to characterize the martensite-to-austenite reversion kinetics and the reverted austenite stability upon cooling to room temperature . 
The reverted austenite size and distribution were measured by Electron Backscattered Diffraction . 
Results showed that the selected soaking temperatures of 610 °C and 650 °C promoted significant and gradual martensite-to-austenite reversion with high thermal stability . 
Tempering at 690 °C caused massive and complete austenitization , resulting in low austenite stability upon cooling due to compositional homogenization . 
The process of additive manufacturing ( AM ) has rapidly developed over the past two decades and is now addressing the needs of industry for fast production of samples with tailored properties and complex geometries . 
One of the most common alloys fabricated from powder using the Laser Powder Bed Fusion ( L-PBF ) method is AlSi10Mg . 
The effects of the inherent anisotropy and existing porosity in AM AlSi10Mg were investigated in terms of thermophysical properties , namely thermal conductivity , diffusivity , heat capacity and thermal expansion . 
In both cases , the sample showed abnormal thermal expansion and conductivity , as compared to a conventionally fabricated sample . 
After heat treatment , macro- and microstructure analysis confirmed that thermally induced porosity ( TIP ) had occurred . 
The anisotropic behaviors of thermal conductivity , diffusivity and thermal expansion were found to be related to the texture , preferred orientation and pore distribution of the aluminum grains in the L-PBF-treated samples . 
Design for additive manufacturing ( DFAM ) guidelines are important for helping designers avoid iterations and leverage the design freedoms afforded by additive manufacturing ( AM ) . 
This paper describes how quantitative design guidelines are compiled for a polymer selective laser sintering ( SLS ) process via a metrology study . 
As part of the metrology study , a test part is designed to focus specifically on geometric resolution and accuracy of the polymer SLS process . 
The test part is compact , allowing it to be easily inserted into existing SLS builds and therefore eliminating the need for dedicated metrology builds . 
To build a statistical foundation upon which design guidelines can be compiled , multiple copies of the test part are fabricated within existing commercial builds in a factorial study with materials , build orientations , and locations within the build chamber as control factors . 
Enhancing the corrosion resistance and improving the biological response to 316 L stainless steel is a long-standing and active area of biomedical research . 
Here , we analyzed the structure and corrosion tendency of selective laser melted-additively manufactured ( AM ) 316 L stainless steel ( AM 316L SS ) and its wrought counterpart . 
SEM analysis showed a fine ( 500–800 nm ) interconnected sub-granular structure for the AM 316L SS , but a polygonal coarse-grained structure for the wrought sample . 
Relative to the wrought sample , the AM 316L SS also exhibited a higher charge transfer resistance and higher breakdown potential ( ˜1000 mV vs. SCE ) when tested in biological electrolytes , which included human serum , PBS , and 0.9 M NaCl . 
A higher pitting resistance ( extended passive region ) and improved stability of the AM 316L SS was attributed to its dense structure of oxide film and refined microstructure . 
Finally , material compatibility with pre-osteoblasts was analyzed . 
Large cytoplasmic extension of osteoblast cells and retention of stiller morphology was observed when cells were cultured on the AM 316L SS as compared to its wrought counterpart , suggesting that the AM 316L SS was a better substrate for cell spreading and differentiation . 
Runx2 , an anti–proliferative marker indicative of differentiation , was equivalent in cells cultured on either samples , but overall more cells were present on the AM 316L SS . 
Given its higher corrosion resistance and ability to support osteoblast adherence , spreading and differentiation , the AM 316L SS has potential for use in the biomedical industry . 
Simulations of the material deposition in extrusion-based additive manufacturing . 
Prediction of the strand cross-section as function of the processing parameters . 
Negative linear relationship between the printing force and the printing speed . 
We propose a numerical model to simulate the extrusion of a strand of semi-molten material on a moving substrate , within the computation fluid dynamics paradigm . 
According to the literature , the deposition flow of the strands has an impact on the inter-layer bond formation in extrusion-based additive manufacturing , as well as the surface roughness of the fabricated part . 
Under the assumptions of an isothermal Newtonian fluid and a creeping laminar flow , the deposition flow is controlled by two parameters : the gap distance between the extrusion nozzle and the substrate , and the velocity ratio of the substrate to the average velocity of the flow inside the nozzle . 
The numerical simulation fully resolves the deposition flow and provides the cross-section of the printed strand . 
The adoption of additive manufacturing ( AM ) for fabricating biomedical implants at hospitals provides many potential benefits . 
Relative to biomedical implants fabricated via traditional manufacturing ( TM ) , typically available by suppliers out of the immediate region , biomedical implants fabricated through AM provides an opportunity to receive more patient-specific , customized parts with faster response , a lower inventory level , and reduced delivery costs . 
Despite the promising features of AM technologies , the make-or-buy decisions are not straightforward and require careful investigation due to the relatively high AM machine and production costs . 
No research efforts , to the best of our knowledge , have been dedicated to the quantitative analysis of the costs of supply chains integrated with AM facilities , e.g. 
, inventory cost , transportation cost , product lead time , etc . 
In this study , we propose a stochastic cost model to quantify the supply-chain level costs associated with the production of biomedical implants using AM techniques , and investigate the economic feasibility of using such technologies to fabricate biomedical implants at the sites of hospitals . 
The problem is formulated in the form of a stochastic programming model , which determines the number of AM facilities to be established and volume of product flow between manufacturing facilities and hospitals . 
A customized Sample Average Algorithm ( SAA ) is developed to obtain the solutions . 
We apply the cost model to a real-world case study that focuses on the use of biomedical implants for hospitals in the state of Mississippi ( MS ) , and identify the conditions and cost parameters that have significant impact on the economic feasibility of AM . 
We find that the ratio between the unit production costs of AM and TM ( ATR ) , as well as product lead time and demands , are key cost parameters that determine the economic feasibility of AM . 
Popular dialogue around additive manufacturing ( AM ) often assumes that AM will cause a move from centralized to distributed manufacturing . 
We combine a Process-Based Cost Model and an optimization model to analyze the optimal location and number of manufacturing sites , and the tradeoffs between production , transportation and inventory costs . 
We use as a case study the commercial aviation maintenance market and a titanium jet engine bracket as an exemplar of a class of parts that are not flight-critical . 
We run our analysis for three different scenarios , one corresponding to the current state of the technology , and two which represent potential improvements in AM technology . 
Our results suggest that the cost-minimizing number of manufacturing locations does not vary significantly when taking into account a range of plausible improvements in the technology . 
In this case , distributed manufacturing is only favorable for a set of non-critical components that can be produced on the same equipment with minimal certification requirements and whose annual demand is in the tens of thousands . 
Distributed manufacturing is attractive at lower volumes for components that require no hot isostatic pressing . 
Through the combination of in-situ alloying and additive manufacturing with gas tungsten arc welding , a new approach to fabricating titanium aluminide alloys is proposed . 
This innovative and low cost process has many similarities to multipass welding . 
It has been a generally accepted practice to maintain a specified interpass temperature when multipass welding many different alloys to prevent defects such as cracks . 
Increasing the interpass temperature can facilitate phase transformation by extending the high temperature period and produce the desired weld microstructure.This study examines the influence of different interpass temperatures on in-situ alloyed and additively manufactured γ-TiAl alloy . 
The microstructure , chemical composition , phase constitution and microhardness of all the test components were respectively examined by using light microscopy , SEM-EDS , X-ray diffraction and a Duromain 70 Hardness Tester . 
No appreciable changes in microstructure and composition were found as interpass temperature was changed . 
However , as the interpass temperature was increased from 100 °C to 400 °C , a decrease of α2 phase fraction was observed due to the lower cooling rate . 
Consequently , the microhardness value also decreased . 
A further increase of interpass temperature to 500 °C produced only minor reductions in the brittle α2 phase fraction and the microhardness value . 
In view of these results , a suitable interpass temperature was found for producing crack-free components . 
Increasingly , metal parts made by additive manufacturing are produced using powder bed fusion ( PBF ) . 
In this paper we report upon the combined effects of PBF parameters , including power and scan speed , in layer-by-layer manufacturing of gas atomized non-modulated ( NM ) Ni-Mn-Ga alloy . 
The effects of process parameters upon PBF is studied by applying nine different parameter sets in the as-printed state and after homogenization and ordering . 
The chemical composition of the samples is analyzed using EDX attached to an SEM , and the crystal structures are determined by X-ray diffraction . 
The phase transformation temperatures are measured using a low-field ac susceptibility measurement system and the magnetic properties are measured with a vibrating sample magnetometer ( VSM ) . 
Before the heat-treatment , all as-printed samples showed paramagnetic behavior with low magnetization and no phase transformations could be observed in the susceptibility measurements . 
After annealing , the samples recovered the ferromagnetic behavior with comparable magnetization to annealed gas atomized powder . 
The as-printed samples were composed of a mixture of different crystal structures . 
However , after annealing the original NM structure with a = b = 5.47 Å and c = 6.66 Å with a c/a -ratio of 1.22 was recovered and crystallographic twins could be observed in an SEM . 
Expanding on prior process mapping work by the authors , multiple melt pool cross-sections are measured at multiple process parameter combinations for the Inconel 718 alloy in a Laser Powder Bed Fusion ( L-PBF ) process . 
Collection of such data enables the study of the variability of melt pool geometry ( e.g . 
width , depth , and cross-sectional area ) across process space . 
Furthermore , the statistical distribution of the measured melt pool geometries is compared to that of an equivalent normal distribution and intriguing outliers are observed . 
The cross-sectional morphology of the melt pools are associated with defects such as keyholing porosity and balling and the variability of the defects is quantified . 
The final product of this work is a robust description of L-PBF In718 melt pool behavior , based on ex-situ observations , which can be linked to in-situ observations of melt pool morphology in future work . 
This study evaluates the performance of continuous carbon , Kevlar and glass fibre reinforced composites manufactured using the fused deposition modelling ( FDM ) additive manufacturing technique . 
The fibre reinforced nylon composites were fabricated using a Markforged Mark One 3D printing system . 
The mechanical performance of the composites was evaluated both in tension and flexure . 
The influence of fibre orientation , fibre type and volume fraction on mechanical properties were also investigated . 
The results were compared with that of both non-reinforced nylon control specimens , and known material property values from literature . 
It was demonstrated that of the fibres investigated , those fabricated using carbon fibre yielded the largest increase in mechanical strength per fibre volume . 
Its tensile strength values were up to 6.3 times higher than those obtained with the non-reinforced nylon polymer . 
As the carbon and glass fibre volume fraction increased so too did the level of air inclusion in the composite matrix , which impacted on mechanical performance . 
As a result , a maximum efficiency in tensile strength was observed in glass specimen as fibre content approached 22.5 % , with higher fibre contents ( up to 33 % ) , yielding only minor increases in strength . 
Approaches used in Computational Welding Mechanics are applicable for additive Manufacturing . 
The model sizes pose additional challenges in case of simulating AM . 
Models must couple microstructural and material behavior . 
The paper describes the application of modeling approaches used in Computational Welding Mechanics ( CWM ) applicable for simulating Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) . 
It focuses on the approximation of the behavior in the process zone and the behavior of the solid material , particularly in the context of changing microstructure . 
Two examples are shown , one for the precipitation hardening Alloy 718 and one for Ti-6Al-4V . 
The latter alloy is subject to phase changes due to the thermal cycling . 
A model for additive manufacturing by selective laser melting of a powder bed with application to alumina ceramic is presented . 
Based on Beer–Lambert law , a volume heat source model taking into account the material absorption is derived . 
The level set method is used to track the shape of deposed bead . 
Shrinkage during consolidation from powder to liquid and compact medium is modeled by a compressible Newtonian constitutive law . 
A semi-implicit formulation of surface tension is used , which permits a stable resolution to capture the liquid/gas interface . 
The influence of different process parameters on temperature distribution , melt pool profiles and bead shapes is discussed . 
The effects of liquid viscosity and surface tension on melt pool dynamics are investigated . 
Three dimensional simulations of several passes are also presented to study the influence of the scanning strategy . 
A wire-arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) system is used to fabricate iron rich Fe–Al intermetallics with 25 at % aluminum content . 
The alloy is produced in situ through controlled addition of the elemental iron and aluminum components into the welding process . 
The properties of the fabricated material are assessed using optical microstructure analysis , hardness testing , tensile testing , X-ray diffraction phase characterization and electron dispersive spectrometry . 
It is shown that the WAAM system is capable of producing iron rich Fe–Al intermetallics with higher yield strength and similar room temperature ductility when compared to equivalent materials produced using powder metallurgy . 
Support structures are required in powder bed fusion ( PBF ) additive manufacturing of metallic components with overhanging structures in order to reinforce and anchor the part , preventing warping during fabrication . 
In this study , we tested the tensile structural strength of support structures with four different 2-dimensional lattice geometries by fabricating samples composed of solid material on the bottom , followed by support material in the middle , followed by solid material on the top . 
The support structure regions were fabricated with a lower linear heat input than the solid material , providing deliberate geometrical stress concentrations to enable the removal of support material after processing . 
These samples were subjected to tension in the vertical direction to measure the strengths of the support structure-solid material interfaces . 
Two strengths were computed : an effective structural strength defined as the total force that the structure withstood normalized by the full cross-sectional area , and a ligament structural strength , defined as the effective structural strength normalized by the density of the solid material , thereby ignoring the volume of the surrounding powder and voids that do not contribute to the strength of the lattice . 
The effective structural strength was 14–32 % of the strength of fully dense Ti-6Al-4V made by PBF and the ligament structural strength was 34–49 % of the strength of fully dense material . 
These interface strengths are lower than that of fully-dense material due to the stress concentrations at the support structure-solid material interfaces , not any intrinsic difference in the intrinsic strength of support structure versus solid material . 
These results can be used to tailor the support structure geometry to balance sufficient anchoring strength during fabrication and ease of part removal and subsequent machining during post-processing . 
In-situ detection of processing defects is a critical challenge for Laser Powder Bed Fusion Additive Manufacturing . 
Many of these defects are related to interactions between the recoater blade , which spreads the powder , and the powder bed . 
This work leverages Deep Learning , specifically a Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN ) , for autonomous detection and classification of many of these spreading anomalies . 
Importantly , the input layer of the CNN is modified to enable the algorithm to learn both the appearance of the powder bed anomalies as well as key contextual information at multiple size scales . 
These modifications to the CNN architecture are shown to improve the flexibility and overall classification accuracy of the algorithm while mitigating many human biases . 
A case study is used to demonstrate the utility of the presented methodology and the overall performance is shown to be superior to that of methodologies previously reported by the authors . 
The observation of sub-grained cellular features in additively manufactured ( AM ) /selectively laser melted ( SLM ) 316L stainless steel components has remained an interesting , though incompletely understood phenomenon . 
However , the recently observed correlation linking the presence of these features with significantly enhanced mechanical strength in SLM 316L materials has driven a renewed interest and effort toward elucidating the mechanism ( s ) by which they are formed . 
These phenomena include SLM-induced intrinsic strain-aging , Cottrell atmosphere formation , and twin-boundary enhanced mass diffusion to structural defects . 
Furthermore , evidence is provided to support the proposed theory that the observed chemical heterogeneity coincident with dislocation cell structures is actually the result of local , strain energy density induced solid state diffusion . 
Numerical simulation of residual deformation in metallic components with dense lattice support structures by the laser powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) additive manufacturing process has been a significant challenge due to the very high computational expense in performing both finite element meshing and analysis . 
In this work , the modified inherent strain method is extended to enable efficient residual deformation simulation of l-PBF components with lattice support structures . 
The asymptotic homogenization method is employed to obtain the equivalent mechanical properties including the anisotropic elastic modulus and inherent strains given the topological configuration and laser scanning strategy of the thin-walled lattice support structures . 
A key finding is that the in-plane homogenized inherent strain values decrease with increasing volume density , which can be attributed to the directional dependence of inherent strains for the AM-processed material . 
Based on the homogenized mechanical properties and inherent strains , the thin-walled lattice support structures can be considered to be an effective solid continuum so that the simulation can be accelerated significantly to obtain residual deformation . 
Good accuracy of the homogenized mechanical property and inherent strains is validated by comparing the simulated residual deformation with experimental deformation measurement of several lattice structured beams of different volume densities . 
In addition , the scalability of the proposed method is also verified through application to a complex L-PBF component fabricated with thin-walled support structures . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) promises great potential benefits for industrial manufacturers who require low volume and functional , highly complex , end-use products . 
Commercial adoption of AM has been slow due to factors such as quality control , production rates , and repeatability . 
However , given AM 's potential , numerous research efforts are underway to improve the quality of the product realization process . 
A major area of opportunity is to complement existing efforts with advancements in end-to-end digital implementations of AM processes . 
Systematically configured digital implementations would facilitate informational transformations through standard interfaces , streamlining the AM digital spectrum . 
Here , we propose the development of a federated , information systems architecture for additive manufacturing . 
We establish an information requirements workflow for streamlining information throughput during product realization . 
The architecture is delivered through the development of a solution stack , including the identification of areas where advancements in information representations will have the highest impact . 
Common data structures and interfaces will allow developers and end users of additive manufacturing technologies to simplify , coordinate , validate , and verify end-to-end digital implementations . 
This paper investigates the development of a novel high temperature polymer composite material by modifying polyetherimide ( PEI ) ULTEM™ 1010 with the addition of functional additives and processing it into filaments for Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) . 
Through twin-screw extrusion , four different formulations were obtained using combinations of hollow glass microspheres , nanoclay , and non-halogenated flame-retardant additives . 
These additives were designed to create a material that exhibits low density , high char yield , and low flammability . 
Filament quality was characterized and reported . 
SiC particles were added in-situ during WAAM of an high strength low alloy steel . 
Cementite formed in the SiC-containing parts due to SiC dissociation in the melt pool . 
Non-melted SiC particles acted as nucleating agents promoting grain refinement . 
Improved mechanical properties were obtained upon the use of SiC . 
In this work , SiC particles were added to the molten pool during WAAM of a high strength low alloy steel . 
The introduction of these high melting point particles promoted grain refinement , and the precipitation of Fe3C due to SiC dissociation . 
The microstructural evolution was studied by optical and electron microscopy techniques and high energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction . 
Additionally , mechanical testing and hardness profiles were obtained for the SiC-containing and SiC-free parts . 
An improvement in the mechanical strength of the SiC-added WAAM parts was observed , which was attributed to the refined grain structure and finely dispersed Fe3C . 
The present study systematically investigated the mechanical properties of wire-based ( wire and arc additive manufacturing , known as WAAM ) deposition of steel metals , both stainless steel 304 and mild steel ER70S . 
Graded material properties of stainless steel 304 were observed for wear and hardness in the direction of deposition and in Z height , due to variations in local thermal histories of the metal . 
The yield and ultimate strength , however , were not found to be statistically significantly different ( p = 0.55 ) along the direction of deposition for SS304 . 
During wear testing , a grain refinement was observed directly beneath the wear scar in these materials in a focused ion beam channel observed under scanning electron microscopy . 
Additionally , no significant difference in yield strength was observed in printed mild steel ( ER70S ) between vertical and horizontal specimens . 
The observed graded mechanical properties in stainless steel 304 allow the opportunity for varying the processing conditions to design parts with locally optimized or functionally graded mechanical properties . 
Lattice structures are frequently found in nature and engineering due to their myriad attractive properties , with applications ranging from molecular to architectural scales . 
Lattices have also become a key concept in additive manufacturing , which enables precise fabrication of complex lattices that would not be possible otherwise . 
While design and simulation tools for stiff lattices are common , here we present a digital design and nonlinear simulation approach for additive manufacturing of soft lattices structures subject to large deformations and instabilities , for which applications in soft robotics , healthcare , personal protection , energy absorption , fashion and design are rapidly emerging . 
Our framework enables design of soft lattices with curved members conforming to freeform geometries , and with variable , gradually changing member thickness and material , allowing the local control of stiffness . 
We model the lattice members as 3D curved rods and using a spline-based isogeometric method that allows the efficient simulation of nonlinear , large deformation behavior of these structures directly from the CAD geometries . 
Furthermore , we enhance the formulation with a new joint stiffening approach , which is based on parameters derived from the actual node geometries . 
Simulation results are verified against experiments with soft lattices realized by PolyJet multi-material polymer 3D printing , highlighting the potential for simulation-driven , digital design and application of non-uniform and curved soft lattice structures . 
Premelting electron beam-assisted freeform fabrication ( PEBF3 ) method is proposed for the first time . 
Al and Ti are joined by PEBF3 with no defects . 
Meanwhile , TiAl3 reinforced aluminum matrix composites are obtained . 
TiAl3 reinforced aluminum matrix composites have better wear resistance than aluminum alloy with no TiAl3 . 
The reasons for the friction coefficient of the deposition with TiAl3 changes periodically are explained and verified . 
Premelting electron beam-assisted freeform fabrication , as a new method to avoid the direct coupling of wire-beam-molten pool during electron beam freeform fabrication , is proposed for the first time . 
The three factors referring to wire , beam and molten pool , are decomposed into two factors as wire and beam . 
The liquid metal is formed in the diversion nozzle , as the wire is heated and melted inside it by an electron beam , and , subsequently , is transferred to the substrate with solidification process . 
Finally , a continuous and stable process of premelting electron beam-assisted freeform fabrication is achieved . 
When an aluminum alloy was deposited on a TC4 substrate by premelting electron beam-assisted freeform fabrication , the TC4 base metal did not melt because the electron beam did not directly act on the TC4 substrate . 
There is no stirring of the electron beam inside the liquid deposition body , and the dissolution and diffusion of elemental Ti exists , which ensures the effective connection between the deposition and the TC4 substrate . 
Although TiAl3 intermetallic compounds were generated in the deposition , the interface between TiAl3 and the Al matrix was coherent , as ( 101 ) TiAl3// ( 020 ) Al was clearly detected in the center of the deposition . 
There are no cracks or other defects in the deposition . 
The acicular TiAl3 intermetallic compounds are dispersed in the deposition , which improves the wear resistance of the deposition . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) enables production of geometrically-complex elastomeric structures . 
The elastic recovery and strain-rate dependence of these materials means they are ideal for use in dynamic , repetitive mechanical loading . 
Their process-dependence , and the frequent emergence of new AM elastomers , commonly necessitates full material characterisation ; however , accessing specialised equipment means this is often a time-consuming and expensive process . 
This work presents an innovative equi-biaxial rig that enables full characterisation via a conventional material testing machine ( supplementing uni-axial tension and planar tension tests ) . 
Combined with stress relaxation data , this provides a novel route for hyperelastic material modelling with viscoelastic components . 
This approach was validated by recording the force-displacement and deformation histories from finite element modelling a honeycomb structure . 
These data compared favourably to experimental quasistatic and dynamic compression testing , validating this novel and convenient route for characterising complex elastomeric materials . 
Supported by data describing the potential for high build-quality production using an AM process with low barriers to entry , this study should serve to encourage greater exploitation of this emerging manufacturing process for fabricating elastomeric structures within industrial communities . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) allows for layer-by-layer fabrication of complex metallic parts with features typically unobtainable via conventional manufacturing . 
For heat exchangers , such complex features are desirable for enhancing their heat transfer capability and conformability to specific applications . 
In this case study , Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) , a laser-based additive manufacturing process , was utilized to fabricate a compact ( 5.08 cm × 3.81 cm × 1.58 cm ) flat-plate oscillating heat pipe ( FP-OHP ) with innovative design features , including a Ti–6Al–4V casing and a closed-loop , circular mini-channel ( 1.53 mm in diameter ) consisting of four interconnected layers . 
Venting holes were integrated to intersect each layer to allow for a unique layer-by-layer , plug-and-pressurize de-powdering procedure . 
The device channel surface was inspected via Scanning Electron Microscopy ( SEM ) – and it was found that the channel wall consisted of partially un-melted particles , as well as amorphous melt regions ; surface characteristics influential on surface/fluid capillarity and heat transfer . 
This study also highlights important design and manufacturing concerns encountered during SLM of channel-embedded parts , such as channel surface quality and de-powdering . 
The Ti–6Al–4V FP-OHP was found to operate successfully with an effective thermal conductivity of approximately 110 W/m K at a power input of 50 W ; demonstrating a 400–500 % increase relative to solid Ti–6Al–4V . 
This paper addresses a comprehensive analytical model for the laser powder-fed additive manufacturing ( LPF-AM ) process , also known as directed energy deposition AM . 
The model analytically couples the moving laser beam with Gaussian energy distribution , the powder stream and the semi-infinite substrate together , while considering the attenuated laser power intensity distribution , the heated powder spatial distribution and the melt pool 3D shape with its boundary variation . 
The particles concentration on transverse plane is modeled with Gaussian distribution based on optical measurement . 
The model can effectively be used for process development/optimization and controller design , while predicting adequate clad geometry as well as the catchment efficiency rapidly . 
Experimental validation through the deposition of Inconel 625 proves the model can accurately predict the clad geometry and catchment efficiency in the range of specific energy that is corresponding to high clad quality ( maximum percentage difference is 6.2 % for clad width , 7.8 % for clad height and 6.8 % for catchment efficiency ) . 
To produce complex functional devices while eliminating the need for assembly calls for a multi-material additive manufacturing technology . 
This paper presented a 3D-printing system that integrated fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) and laser-based powder bed fusion ( PBF ) to produce hybrid metal and polymer components . 
PBF-printed metal and FFF-printed polymer , both of which differ in material properties , were joined through PBF-printed interlocking structures , with their joining strength enhanced by laser heating . 
Tensile and shear tests confirmed good joint strength of the printed metal/polymer components , which were created without adhesives . 
In addition , metal powder deposition onto the top of polymer substrates through laser melting was demonstrated . 
Finally , several 3D components consisting of hybrid stainless steel ( SS 316L ) , copper ( Cu10Sn ) and polymer ( PLA , PET ) were successfully printed and their potential applications were discussed . 
Depending on the available laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) system , and the intended application , the use of highly-optimized LPBF parameters to fabricate near-perfect density alloys may not be feasible , economical or required . 
Thus , it is important to understand how sub-optimal density and microstructure can simultaneously affect the mechanical properties of alloys . 
Here we study the microstructure and properties of an AlSi10Mg alloy fabricated with sub-optimal parameters and investigate the effectiveness of post-processing by hot isostatic pressing ( HIP ) and T6 heat treatment . 
Defects were characterized using micro-computed tomography while the microstructure was analysed using transmission and scanning electron microscopy . 
The as-built microstructure features dendritically-arranged nano-crystalline Si particles that are favourable for high hardness , strength and impact toughness while T6 generally caused these properties to degrade . 
HIP was unable to close large defects due to trapped gases , which limited fatigue life improvements . 
Defects oriented normal to the loading axis ( or parallel to the fracture plane ) are very detrimental , but when oriented favourably , the alloy was still able to achieve comparable strength and ductility to results reported in literature for LPBF-fabricated AlSi10Mg alloys . 
Interestingly , the anisotropic nano-crystalline Si structures of the as-built alloy resulted in substantially improved toughness even when defects were oriented unfavourably . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes are being frequently used in industry as they allow the manufacture of complex parts with reduced lead times . 
Electron beam-powder bed fusion ( EB-PBF ) as an AM technology is known for its near-net-shape production capacity with low residual stress . 
However , the surface quality and geometrical accuracy of the manufactured parts are major obstacles for the wider industrial adoption of this technology , especially when enhanced mechanical performance is taken into consideration . 
Identifying the origins of surface features such as satellite particles and sharp valleys on the parts manufactured by EB-PBF is important for a better understanding of the process and its capability . 
Moreover , understanding the influence of the contour melting strategy , by altering process parameters , on the surface roughness of the parts and the number of near-surface defects is highly critical . 
In this study , processing parameters of the EB-PBF technique such as scanning speed , beam current , focus offset , and number of contours ( one or two ) with the linear melting strategy were investigated . 
A sample manufactured using Arcam-recommended process parameters ( three contours with the spot melting strategy ) was used as a reference . 
For the samples with one contour , the scanning speed had the greatest effect on the arithmetical mean height ( Sa ) , and for the samples with two contours , the beam current and focus offset had the greatest effect . 
For the samples with two contours , a lower focus offset and lower scan speed ( at a higher beam current ) resulted in a lower Sa ; however , increasing the scan speed for the samples with one contour decreased Sa . 
In general , the samples with two contours provided a lower Sa ( ∼22 % ) but with slightly higher porosity ( ∼8 % ) compared to the samples with one contour . 
Fewer defects were detected with a lower scanning speed and higher beam current . 
The number of defects and the Sa value for the samples with two contours manufactured using the linear melting strategy were ∼85 % and 16 % , respectively , lower than those of the reference samples manufactured using the spot melting strategy . 
Given the attention around additive manufacturing ( AM ) , organizations want to know if their products should be fabricated using AM . 
To facilitate product development decisions , a reference system is shown describing the key attributes of a product from a manufacturability stand-point : complexity , customization , and production volume . 
A geometric complexity factor developed for cast parts is modified for a more general application . 
Parts with varying geometric complexity are then analyzed and mapped into regions of the complexity , customization , and production volume model . 
Implications for product development and manufacturing business approaches are discussed . 
Rod shaped samples of AlSi10Mg additively manufactured using recycled powder through direct metal laser sintering ( DMLS ) process showed higher quasi-static uniaxial tensile strength in both horizontal and vertical build directions than those of cast counterpart alloy . 
In addition , they offered mechanical properties within the range of other additively manufactured counterparts . 
TEM showed that the microstructure of the as-built samples comprised of cell-like structures featured by dislocation networks and Si precipitates . 
HRTEM studies revealed the semi-coherency characteristics of the Si precipitates . 
After deformation , the dislocation density increased as a result of generation of new dislocations due to dislocation motion . 
The dislocations bypassed the precipitates by bowing around them and penetrating the semi-coherent precipitates . 
Strengthening of recycled DMLS-AlSi10Mg alloys manufactured in both directions was attributed to Orowan mechanism ( due to existence of Si precipitates ) , Hall-Petch effect ( due to eutectic cell walls ) , and dislocation hardening ( due to pre-existing dislocation networks ) . 
Due to the slightly different microstructure , the contribution of each strengthening mechanism was slightly different in identical samples made with virgin powder . 
Three different AlSi10Mg_200C samples with near optimum process parameters were built . 
AlSi10Mg_200C samples with very low surface roughness were produced . 
AlSi10Mg_200C samples also possessed very low porosity levels . 
OM and SEM Microscopy analyses were performed to investigate causality . 
Laser sintered aluminum alloys produced by metal 3D printers can replace cast aluminum alloys in aerospace , defense , and marine industries by offering better mechanical properties , less porosity , and competitive fatigue characteristics . 
One of the major issues currently is the considerable surface roughness of additively manufactured aluminum alloys demanding post-processing procedures such as bead blasting or machining . 
In the current study , the process parameters such as laser power , scan speed , and hatch spacing were altered such that better surface roughness could be achieved for AlSi10Mg_200C using a Direct Metal Laser Sintering ( DMLS ) system . 
The process parameters were chosen such that three samples with the same core properties but different upskin characteristics were produced . 
The achieved surface roughness of the additively manufactured aluminum samples were almost as low as one fifth of the regular samples manufactured using standard process parameters . 
The microstructure and the porosity level of the samples printed by different process parameters were studied to reveal the causality of the low surface roughness for the proposed process . 
Large-scale polymer AM is very susceptible to part failure due to thermal warping . 
A 1D heat transfer model can predict the temperature evolution of thin walls . 
Parameter studies provide guidance for minimizing the likelihood of build failure . 
Higher thermal conductivity is shown to be detrimental to the success of the build . 
The incremental deposition process utilized by most additive manufacturing ( AM ) technologies presents significant challenges related to residual stresses and warping which arise from repeated deposition of hot material onto cooler material . 
In this work we investigate the thermal evolution in thin walls of carbon fiber/acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( CF/ABS ) composite materials fabricated via Big Area Additive Manufacturing ( BAAM ) . 
We measure the thermal evolution of composite parts during the build process using infrared imaging , and develop a simple 1D transient thermal model to describe the build process . 
The model predictions are in excellent agreement with the observed temperature profiles and from the results we develop criteria to guide deposition parameter selection to minimize the likelihood of cracking during printing . 
Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) was used to produce 3D-printed net shape NdFeB ( Neodymium Iron Boron ) permanent magnets that exhibit relatively large internal permanent magnetization structures , without exposure to any external magnetizing field . 
The permanent magnetization can be detected via the stray field that appears after cutting the sample into pieces . 
Maximum magnetic flux densities of almost 80 mT are recorded 1 mm above the cut surfaces in the air . 
Dependencies of the effect on SLM process parameters , as well as on the sample size and shape are discussed . 
The discovered effect may offer new routes for producing magnetized rare earth-transition metal ( RE-TM ) permanent magnets without using a magnetizer , and it shows that the SLM 3D-printing process can lead to new material behavior . 
Thermally induced residual stresses and residual distortions in the additive manufactured ( AM ) parts are two of the major obstacles that are preventing AM technology from gaining wide adoption . 
In this work , a three-dimensional thermo-elastic-plastic model is proposed to predict the thermomechanical behavior in the laser engineered net shaping ( LENS ) process of Ti-6Al-4V using Finite Element Method ( FEM ) . 
It is shown that the computed thermal history and mechanical deformations are in good agreement with the experimental measurements . 
The main contributions of this study are : ( I ) in the past , a point-wise comparison between simulation results and experimental measurements is more favored to validate the employed model , where the general picture is lost ; rather , to validate the proposed model , the simulated distortion of the bottom surface of a thin substrate is compared with experimental measurements using a 3D laser scanner , in terms of both magnitude and distribution map . 
( II ) Rather few works have been done to show the effectiveness of widely employed quasi-static mechanical analysis in the transient LENS process ; as such , both quasi-static and dynamic simulations are performed and compared mechanically to demonstrate the validity of using quasi-static modeling to save computational cost . 
Additively manufactured ( AM ) conformal cooling channels are currently the state of the art for high performing tooling with reduced cycle times . 
This paper introduces the concept of conformal cooling layers which challenges the status quo in providing higher heat transfer rates that also provide less variation in tooling temperatures.The cooling layers are filled with self-supporting repeatable unit cells that form a lattice throughout the cooling layers . 
The lattices increase fluid vorticity which improves convective heat transfer . 
Mechanical testing of the lattices shows that the design of the unit cell significantly varies the compression characteristics.A virtual case study of the injection moulding of a plastic enclosure is used to compare the performance of conformal cooling layers with that of conventional ( drilled ) cooling channels and conformal ( AM ) cooling channels . 
The results show the conformal layers reduce cooling time by 26.34 % over conventional cooling channels . 
A wide range of materials is suitable for processing by powder bed fusion ( PBF ) techniques . 
Among the latest formulations , maraging steel 18Ni-300 , which is a martensite-hardenable alloy , is often used when both high fracture toughness and high strength are required , or if dimensional changes need to be minimised . 
In direct tooling , 18Ni-300 can be successfully employed in numerous applications , for example in the production of dies for injection moulding and for casting of aluminium alloys ; moreover , it is particularly valuable for high-performance engineering parts.Even though bibliographic data are available on the effects that parameters , employed in PBF processes , have on the obtained density , roughness , hardness and microstructure of 18Ni-300 , there is still a lack of knowledge on the fatigue life of PBF manufactured parts . 
This paper describes the fatigue behaviour of 18Ni-300 steel manufactured by PBF , as compared by forging . 
Relevant negative effects of the cross-contamination of the raw material are originally identified in this paper , which emphasizes the inadequacy of current acceptability protocols for PBF powders . 
In the absence of contamination , endurance achieved by PBF is found equal to that by forging and consistent with tooling requirements as set out by industrial partners , based on injection moulding process modelling . 
Metal powder bed additive manufacturing technologies , such as the Electron Beam Melting process , facilitate a high degree of geometric flexibility and have been demonstrated as useful production techniques for metallic parts.However , the EBM process is typically associated with lower resolutions and higher surface roughness compared to similar laser-based powder bed metal processes . 
In part , this difference is related to the larger powder size distribution and thicker layers normally used . 
As part of an effort to improve the resolution and surface roughness of EBM fabricated components , this study investigates the feasibility of fabricating components with a smaller powder size fraction and layer thickness ( similar to laser based processes ) . 
The surface morphology , microstructure and tensile properties of the produced samples were evaluated . 
The findings indicate that microstructure is dependent on wall-thickness and that , for thin walled structures , tensile properties can become dominated by variations in surface roughness . 
Additive manufacturing provides new chances in the manufacturing of highly complex , mass-customized structures with negligible wastes . 
Binder jetting holds distinctive promise among additive manufacturing technologies due to its fast , low-cost manufacturing ; stress-free structures with complex internal and external geometries ; and the isotropic properties of the final printed parts . 
An ExOne binder jet 3D printer is used to produce frameworks for removable partial dentures from metallic powder . 
Initially , an existing framework is scanned using micro-computed tomography and then the obtained model is printed . 
Consolidation of the printed parts is achieved with the relative density higher than 99 % density with controlled shrinkage . 
Presented results demonstrate that binder jetting may be used to produce mechanically sound complex-shaped structures as shown here on a denture metal framework model . 
Numerical simulation is used to understand the melting and pressurization mechanism in fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) . 
The results show the incoming fiber melts axisymmetrically , forming a cone of unmelted material in the center surrounded by melted polymer . 
Details of the simulation reveal that a recirculating vortex of melted polymer is formed at the fiber entrance to the hot end . 
The Generalized Newtonian Fluid ( GNF ) model was appropriate for simulation within the region that melts the fiber , however , a viscoelastic model , the Phan-Thien-Tanner ( PTT ) model , was required to capture flow within the nozzle . 
This is due to the presence of an elongational flow as molten material transitions from the melting region ( diameter of 3 mm ) to the nozzle at the exit ( diameter of 0.5 mm ) . 
Increased manufacturing rates are limited by high pressures , necessitating more consideration in the nozzle design of future FFF printers . 
A unique and efficient semi-analytic method is presented for quickly predicting the three-dimensional thermal field produced by conduction from a heat source moving along an arbitrary path . 
A Green 's function approach is used to decouple the solution at each time step into the analytical source contribution and a conduction contribution . 
The latter is solved numerically using efficient Gaussian convolution algorithms . 
This decoupling allows for boundary conditions on side boundaries to be satisfied numerically and lowers computational expenses by allowing calculations to be localized around the heat source . 
The thermal field resulting from arbitrary scan paths is constructed using analytical solutions for elementary linear segments . 
The results of various scan patterns are presented and successfully verified against finite element simulations . 
The computational times of predictions are shown to be faster than the corresponding finite element simulation by an order of magnitude with less than 1 % average error . 
Given its ability to quickly predict the thermal history and changes in melt pool geometry due to arbitrary scan paths , this method provides a potentially powerful tool for exploration and optimization of laser powder bed fusion processes . 
The origins of nano-scale oxide inclusions in 316 L austenitic stainless steel ( SS ) manufactured by laser powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) was investigated by quantifying the possible intrusion pathways of oxygen contained in the precursor powder , extraneous oxygen from the process environment during laser processing , and moisture contamination during powder handling and storage . 
When processing the fresh , as-received powder in a well-controlled environment , the oxide inclusions contained in the precursor powder were the primary contributors to the formation of nano-scale oxides in the final additive manufactured ( AM ) product . 
These oxide inclusions were found to be enriched with oxygen getter elements like Si and Mn . 
By controlling the extraneous oxygen level in the process environment , the oxygen level in AM produced parts was found to increase with the extraneous oxygen level . 
The intrusion pathway of this extra oxygen was found to be dominated by the incorporation of spatter particles into the build during processing . 
Moisture induced oxidation during powder storage was also found to result in a higher oxide density in the AM produced parts . 
SS 316 L powder free of Si and Mn oxygen getters was processed in a well-controlled environment and resulted in a similar level of oxygen intrusion . 
Microhardness testing indicated that the oxide volume fraction increase from extraneous oxygen did not influence hardness values . 
However , a marked decrease in hardness was found for the humidified and Si-Mn free AM processed parts . 
Laser Engineered Net Shaping ( LENS® ) is a metal Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) technique that carries great potential for the fabrication and repair of high-integrity structural and engine components . 
Confident application of the LENS technique requires a fundamental understanding of the microstructure and properties of the fabricated materials , as well as their correlations to processing conditions . 
In this study , two alloys fabricated by LENS , Ti-6Al-4V and Inconel 718 , were examined and compared to their wrought counterparts . 
The differences between low and high laser power fabrications , as well as the effects of various post-LENS heat treatments were systematically investigated and discussed . 
The interfacial bond strength between LENS depositions and substrates were also evaluated for repair purposes . 
The residual porosity and surface roughness of metal materials generated via additive manufacturing are generally regarded as the major influence factors on the fatigue strength . 
The mechanical properties of specimens out of tool steel 1.2344 were investigated . 
Tensile strength and hardness achieved results in the range of conventionally fabricated parts , whereas a significantly lower fatigue strength was observed . 
Cracks were induced by the present cavities as well as in the steel matrix . 
Further investigations of the oxygen content showed a high oxygen content of 570 ppm homogeneously distributed inside the specimens potentially limiting the strength of the matrix itself . 
Process monitoring in additive manufacturing ( AM ) is a crucial component in the mission of broadening AM industrialization . 
However , conventional part evaluation and qualification techniques , such as computed tomography ( CT ) , can only be utilized after the build is complete , and thus eliminate any potential to correct defects during the build process . 
In contrast to post-build CT , in situ defect detection based on in situ sensing , such as layerwise visual inspection , enables the potential for in-process re-melting and correction of detected defects and thus facilitates in-process part qualification . 
This paper describes the development and implementation of such an in situ defect detection strategy for powder bed fusion ( PBF ) AM using supervised machine learning.During the build process , multiple images were collected at each build layer using a high resolution digital single-lens reflex ( DSLR ) camera . 
For each neighborhood in the resulting layerwise image stack , multi-dimensional visual features were extracted and evaluated using binary classification techniques , i.e . 
a linear support vector machine ( SVM ) . 
Through binary classification , neighborhoods are then categorized as either a flaw , i.e . 
an undesirable interruption in the typical structure of the material , or a nominal build condition . 
the true location of flaws and nominal build areas , which are needed to train the binary classifiers , were obtained from post-build high-resolution 3D CT scan data . 
In CT scans , discontinuities , e.g . 
incomplete fusion , porosity , cracks , or inclusions , were identified using automated analysis tools or manual inspection . 
After the classifier had been properly trained , in situ defect detection accuracies greater than 80 % were demonstrated during cross-validation experiments . 
In this paper the heat transfer and residual stress evolution in the direct metal laser sintering process of the additive manufacturing of titanium alloy products are studied . 
A numerical model is developed in a COMSOL multiphysics environment considering the temperature-dependent material properties of TiAl6V4 . 
The thermo-mechanical coupled simulation is performed . 
3-D simulation is used to study single-layer laser sintering . 
A 2-D model is used to study the multi-layer effects of additive manufacturing . 
The results reveal the behavior of the melt pool size , temperature history , and change of the residual stresses of a single layer and among the multiple layers of the effects of the change of the local base temperature and laser power etc . 
The result of the simulation provides a better understanding of the complex thermo-mechanical mechanisms of laser sintering additive manufacturing processes . 
Laser-matter interactions in laser additive manufacturing ( LAM ) occur on short time scales ( 10−6–10−3 s ) and have traditionally proven difficult to characterise . 
We investigate these interactions during LAM of stainless steel SS316L and 13-93 bioactive glass powders using a custom built LAM process replicator ( LAMPR ) with in situ and operando synchrotron X-ray real-time radiography . 
This reveals a wide range of melt track solidification phenomena as well as spatter and porosity formation . 
We hypothesise that the SS316L powder absorbs the laser energy at its surface while the trace elements in the 13-93 bioactive glass powder absorb and remit the infra-red radiation . 
Our results show that a low viscosity melt , e.g . 
8 mPa s for SS316L , tends to generate spatter ( diameter up to 250 μm and an average spatter velocity of 0.26 m s−1 ) and form a melt track by molten pool wetting . 
In contrast , a high viscosity melt , e.g . 
2 Pa s for 13-93 bioactive glass , inhibits spatter formation by damping the Marangoni convection , forming a melt track via viscous flow . 
The viscous flow in 13-93 bioactive glass resists pore transport ; combined with the reboil effect , this promotes pore growth during LAM , resulting in a pore size up to 600 times larger than that exhibited in the SS316L sample . 
An evaluation of low-cost , high-oxygen content Zr-Cu-Al-Nb bulk metallic glasses ( BMGs ) produced through laser powder bed fusion ( PBF ) was performed . 
Four-point bending and wear resistance tests were used to compare the mechanical properties of the printed alloy with laboratory grade cast parts . 
It is shown that the laser PBF parts , while not being able to be cast as a bulk glass , can be printed amorphous up to at least several millimeters thick and yet still have reasonable mechanical properties . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) of highly viscous materials , e.g. 
, polysiloxane ( silicone ) has gained attention in academia and different industries , specifically the medical and healthcare sectors . 
Different AM processes including micro-syringe nozzle dispensing systems have demonstrated promising results in the deposition of highly viscous materials . 
This contact-based 3D printing system has drawbacks such as overfilling of material at locations where there is a change in the direction of the trajectory , thereby reducing the printing quality . 
Modeling the continuous flow of a highly viscous polysiloxane in the nozzle dispensing AM system using finite element analysis will be the first step to solve this overfilling phenomenon . 
The results of simulation can be used to predict the required variation in the value of pressure before the nozzle reaches a corner . 
The level-set method is employed for this simulation , and the results are validated by comparing the flow profile and geometrical parameters of the model with those of the experimental trials of the dispensing of polysiloxane . 
Comparisons show that the model is able to predict the location of the droplet before it reaches the substrate , as well as the height of the droplet generated on the substrate accurately . 
To predict the width of the droplet , adjustment factors need to be considered in calculations based on the value of the pressure . 
A significant microstructural inhomogeneity in EBM fabricated Co-Cr-Mo alloy along building direction . 
Post-production heat treatment regime homogenized microstructures and enhanced mechanical properties . 
The phase constituents significantly affected the mechanical behaviors of Co-Cr-Mo alloy . 
The electron beam melting ( EBM ) , a layer-by-layer additive manufacturing ( AM ) technique , has been recently utilized for fabricating metallic components with complex shape and geometry . 
However , the inhomogeneity in microstructures and mechanical properties are the main drawbacks constraining the serviceability of the EBM-built parts . 
In the present study , we found remarkable microstructural inhomogeneity along build direction in the EBM-built Co-based alloy , owing to the competitive grain growth and subsequent isothermal γ-fcc → ε-hcp phase transformation , which affects the corresponding tensile properties significantly . 
Then , we succeeded in eliminating the inhomogeneities , modifying the phase structures and refining grain sizes via comprehensive post-production heat treatment regimes , which provides a valuable implication for improving the reliabilities of AM-built metals and alloys . 
The Co-based alloy can be selectively transformed into predominant ε or predominant γ phase by the regime , and the grains were refined to 1/10 of the initial sizes by repeated heat treatment . 
Finally , we investigated the tensile properties and fracture behaviors of the alloy before and after each heat treatment . 
The γ → ε strain-induced martensitic transformation is the major deformation mode of the γ phase , meanwhile the formation of stripped ε phase at { 111 } γ habit planes contributed to a good combination of strength and ductility . 
Nevertheless , the ε phase was deformed mainly by ( 0001 ) ε < 11 2¯0 > ε basal and { 1 1¯00 } ε < 11 2¯0 > ε prismatic slip systems , exhibiting very limited ductility and strength . 
In addition , the ε grains act as secondary hardening factor in the samples consisting of dual γ/ε phase , leading to a non-uniform deformation behavior . 
Two new high-carbon high speed steel alloys ; Febal-C-Cr-Mo-V and Febal−x-C-Cr-Mo-V-Wx were additively manufactured by directed energy deposition ( DED ) process . 
Micro-hardness ( 0.5 HV ) measurement of multilayer additively manufactured samples showed no softening of martensite matrix under complex thermal cycling . 
Due to larger phase fraction of metal carbides and formation of a relatively stable oxide layer , Febal−x-C-Cr-Mo-V-Wx showed better high temperature ( 500 °C ) wear resistance than Febal-C-Cr-Mo-V. Neutron diffraction of powders and additively manufactured samples of Febal-C-Cr-Mo-V and Febal−x-C-Cr-Mo-V-Wx alloys showed weak scattering properties . 
The inconclusive strain scanning was either result of a strong crystallographic texture in the bulk or due to existence of nano- or semi-crystalline phases . 
Directed energy deposition ( DED ) of two high-carbon high speed steel alloys Febal-C-Cr-Mo-V and Febal−x-C-Cr-Mo-V-Wx was performed by using a 4 kW Nd : YAG laser source . 
The purpose of additive manufacturing was design and evaluation of thermally stable – high temperature wear resistant alloys . 
High temperature ( 500 °C ) pin-on-disc tests were conducted to investigate the effect of carbides phase fraction on friction and wear . 
Strain scanning of the powder and additively manufactured materials was carried out by Neutron diffraction.Microstructures of both alloys consisted of a martensitic matrix with networks of primary and eutectic carbides . 
Febal−x-C-Cr-Mo-V-Wx showed a better high temperature wear resistance due to greater phase fraction of VC and Mo2C carbides . 
Fracture surfaces of post-heat treated tensile samples of Febal-C-Cr-Mo-V and Febal−x-C-Cr-Mo-V-Wx revealed brittle failures with minimal plasticity . 
Neutron strain mapping of the metal powders and the additively manufactured materials resulted in a weak diffraction signal and peak widening effect . 
Ti–6Al–4V parts made using additive manufacturing processes such as selective laser melting ( SLM ) and electron beam melting ( EBM ) are subject to the inclusion of defects . 
This study purposely fabricated Ti–6Al–4V samples with defects by varying process parameters from the factory default settings in both SLM and EBM systems . 
Process parameters are classified according to their tendency to create certain types of porosity . 
Finally , defect characteristics are discussed with respect to defect generation mechanisms ; and effective process windows for SLM and EBM system are discussed . 
Developed intra-layer , closed-loop control of additive manufacturing build plan . 
Control affected macrostructure , microstructure , and mechanical properties . 
Demonstrated reduced variability in microstructure and hardness with control . 
The location , timing , and arrangement of depositions paths used to build an additively manufactured component – collectively called the build plan – are known to impact local thermal history , microstructure , thermal distortion , and mechanical properties . 
In this work , a novel system architecture for intra-layer , closed-loop control of the build plan is introduced and demonstrated for directed-energy deposition of Ti–6Al–4V . 
The control strategy altered the build plan in real time to ensure that the temperature around the start point of each hatch , prior to deposition , was below a threshold temperature of 415 °C . 
Compared with open-loop processing , closed-loop control resulted in vertical alignment of columnar prior-β grains , more uniform α-lath widths , and more-uniform microhardness values within the deposited component . 
Recently , laser-powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) has been utilized to produce a NiTi shape memory alloy actuator with embedded channels for liquid metal forced fluid convection to increase actuator heat transfer rates . 
To enable further increases in performance , it is critical to characterize and control the surface quality of fully interior channels which have higher surface roughness compared to exterior top surfaces . 
This work utilizes a design of experiments methodology by varying laser power , scan speed , hatch space , scan pattern , channel orientation , and channel diameter on the as-fabricated surface roughness of the overhangs and walls of interior channels in NiTi . 
To enable post-process increases in surface quality , the channels are subjected to an electropolishing treatment and further characterized . 
Internal channel surfaces are characterized using optical profilometry and SEM imaging . 
It is concluded that channel orientation plays a prominent role in determining the surface roughness of as-fabricated interior channels , and a lower laser energy density results in the highest reduction in surface roughness after an electropolishing treatment . 
Laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) additive manufacturing and laser welding are powerful metal processing techniques with broad applications in advanced sectors such as the biomedical and aerospace industries . 
One common process variable that can tune laser-material interaction dynamics in these two techniques is adjustment of the composition and pressure of the atmosphere in which the process is conducted . 
While some of the physical mechanisms that are governed by the ambient pressure are well known from the welding literature , it remains unclear how these mechanisms extend to the distinct process conditions of LPBF . 
In situ studies of the differences in subsurface structure and behavior are essential for understanding the effects of gas pressure and composition on the LPBF processes . 
This article reports the use of in situ X-ray imaging to directly probe the morphological evolution of the liquid-vapor interface during laser melting as a function of ambient pressure and oxygen partial pressure under LPBF conditions in 316 L steel , Ti-64 , aluminum 6061 , and Nickel 400 . 
We observe significant changes in melt pool morphology as a function of pressure . 
Furthermore , similar changes in morphology occur due to an increase in oxygen partial pressure in the process atmosphere . 
Temperature- and composition-dependent changes in surface tension of the liquid metal drive this change in behavior , which has the potential to influence defect creation and final morphology in LPBF parts . 
Electron beam additive manufacturing ( EBAM ) is a relatively new technology to produce metallic parts in a layer by layer fashion by melting and fusing the metallic powders . 
Ti–6Al–4V is one of the most used industrial alloys used for aerospace and biomedical application . 
EBAM is a rapid solidification process and the properties of the build material depend on the solidification behavior as well as the microstructure of the build material . 
Thus , the prediction of part microstructures during the process may be an important factor for process optimization . 
In this study , a phase field model is developed for microstructure evolution of Ti–6Al–4V powder in EBAM process . 
FORTRAN code is used to solve the phase field equations , which incorporates the temperature gradient and solidification velocity as the simulation parameters . 
The effect of temperature gradient and the beam scan speed on microstructure is investigated through simulation . 
The simulation results are compared with the analytical model and experimental findings by measuring the spacing evolution under the solidification condition Exciting progress in additive manufacturing ( AM ) technology , which enables fabrication of cellular structures with highly complex lattices and pores , has stimulated the development of lightweight structural products with improved performance and increased functionality . 
However , conventional design and analysis tools lack the ability to optimize complex geometries efficiently and robustly . 
With this motivation , in this study , homogenized material models of open-cell polymeric foams with spherical cell architectures that are manufactured by using an AM technology are formulated through both experimental and numerical investigations , which in turn can be employed in a novel micromechanics based topology optimization algorithm developed for the optimization of cellular structures . 
In this regard , generating computer aided drawing ( CAD ) data , which is mandatory for AM , randomly intersected spherical ensemble method is employed . 
Several foam models with different porosities are generated , and utilized in nonlinear finite element analyses ( FEAs ) to determine constitutive elastic constants . 
Plastic stress-strain data for the bulk AM material are obtained through static tensile tests in a variety of different loading directions and these results used in FEA as true stress-strain data . 
Homogenization is performed based on a quadratic form of the widely used Gibson and Ashby foam model , which describes the Young ’ s modulus E∗ and yield strength σpl∗ of cellular structures in terms of relative density . 
Predicting residual distortion in metal additive manufacturing ( AM ) is important to ensure quality of the fabricated component . 
The inherent strain method is ideal for this purpose , but has not been well developed for AM parts yet . 
In this paper , a modified inherent strain model is proposed to estimate the inherent strains from detailed AM process simulation of single line depositions on top of each other . 
The obtained inherent strains are employed in a layer-by-layer static equilibrium analysis to simulate residual distortion of the AM part efficiently . 
To validate the model , depositions of a single wall and a rectangular contour wall models with different number of layers deposited by a representative directed energy deposition ( DED ) process are studied . 
The proposed model is demonstrated to be accurate by comparing with full-scale detailed process simulation and experimental results . 
Based on this approach , simulation results applied to the rectangular contour wall structures of different heights show that the modified inherent strain method is quite efficient , while the residual distortion of AM parts can be accurately computed within a short time . 
The improvement of the computational efficiency can be up to 80 times in some specific cases . 
Stainless steel 316L dogbones produced using two production methods were studied . 
General corrosion was not considered to be a major form of corrosion after 2184 h. Mechanical properties for the traditionally manufactured samples did not change . 
Mechanical properties for the AM samples decreased during the exposure time . 
Hydrogen embrittlement in the AM samples caused the mechanical properties decrease . 
The effects on the surface and mechanical properties of stainless steel AISI316L dogbones created using either traditional manufacturing ( TM ) or laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) exposed to 0.75 M sulfuric acid solution over 2184 h were studied . 
General corrosion was not a major form of corrosion , based on surface feature changes , surface roughness , and mass loss for either method . 
No change to the mechanical properties occurred for the TM samples . 
Both tensile stress and strain decreased for the LPBF samples . 
The decrease was caused by hydrogen embrittlement , due to the formation of large brittle particles , as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) of complex tungsten carbide-cobalt ( WC-Co ) parts was achieved using binder jet additive manufacturing ( BJAM ) of WC powders followed by Co infiltration . 
Using BJAM with infiltration of the metal phase can limit shrinkage and grain growth in ceramic-metal ( cermet ) composites compared to other additive manufacturing ( AM ) methods . 
Knowledge of previous infiltration studies was used to help process parts to imitate production of parts . 
The properties such as density , microstructure , grain size , and hardness of the parts are characterized along the infiltration height . 
Fracture toughness is measured where applicable . 
This approach has the potential to achieve highly dense WC-Co parts that are net-shaped with some ternary phase and z-direction distortion . 
This paper proposes a novel geometric based scanning strategy adopted in the selective laser melting ( SLM ) manufacturing technology aimed at reducing the level of residual stresses generated during the build-up process . 
A set of computer simulations of the build , based on different scans strategies , including temperature dependent material properties , and a moving heat flux , were performed . 
The research novelty explores intermittent scan strategies in order to analyze the effect of reduction on heat concentration on the residual stress and deformation . 
Coupled thermal-structural computations revealed a significant stress and warpage reduction on the proposed scanning scheme . 
Different powder material properties were investigated and the computational model was validated against published numerical and experimental studies . 
This study focuses on the microstructural evolution in additively manufactured ( AM ) β titanium alloys due to solid-state phase transformations occurring during the reheating of previously deposited layers , directly influencing the uniformity of microstructure across the entire build . 
During the AM of titanium alloys of a wide variety of compositions , including α + β alloys such as Ti-6Al-4 V , and β alloys , when the laser or electron beam hits the sample , the grains in the previously deposited topmost layers either re-melt or transform into the β phase . 
Subsequently , during the cooling cycle , depending on the alloy composition , second-phase precipitation may occur within these layers via solid-state precipitation . 
The present study compares two binary β -Ti alloys , Ti-12Mo and Ti-20 V , that have been processed using laser engineered net shaping ( LENS™ ) , a directed energy deposition technique for AM . 
Compared to Ti-V , which exhibited grains of only the β phase in the as-built condition , the less β stabilized Ti-Mo had extensive second-phase α precipitation within the build . 
The location within the LENS™ build played a pivotal role in determining the size scale , area fraction , and morphology of the α precipitates . 
These changes have been attributed to the different thermal cycles experienced during the deposition process . 
Irrespective of the alloy composition , columnar grains were observed in the depositions with a strong [ 001 ] β texture along the build direction . 
In the Ti-12Mo alloy , wherein second phase α precipitation takes place , there was no significant α texturing , with all twelve variants forming . 
Significant attention has been focused on modeling of metallic additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes , with the initial aim of predicting local thermal history , and ultimately structure and properties . 
Existing models range greatly in physical complexity and computational cost , and the implications of various simplifying assumption often go unassessed . 
In the present work , we first formulate a fast acting Discrete Source Model ( DSM ) capable of handling the complex processing often encountered in metal powder bed fusion AM . 
We then assess implications of the source representation , details of the numeric implementation , as well as effects of boundary conditions and thermophysical parameters . 
While a number of approximations limit its quantitative accuracy , the inexpensive nature and ability to treat complex processing plans suggests it will be useful for screening and identification of regions experiencing anomalous thermal history . 
Electron beam welding ( EBW ) is a high-density energy ( low heat input ) welding technique , resulting in a narrow heat affected zone ( HAZ ) , causing minimal metallurgical changes in the workpieces . 
The present research work investigates EB autogenous welded AlSi10Mg samples , produced by the selective laser melting ( SLM ) additive manufacturing ( AM ) method , with emphasis on the characterization of the joint 's macro- and microstructure . 
When comparing the EB welded AM parts to the EB welded cast samples two main differences were observed : weld metal porosity and a negligible HAZ in the AM joints and low porosity level but substantial HAZ in the welded cast parts . 
These preliminary results show for the first time the feasibility of the EBW technique on AM-SLM specimens . 
The material extrusion additive manufacturing technique known as fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) is an interesting method to fabricate complex ceramic parts whereby feedstocks containing thermoplastic binders and ceramic powders are printed and the resulting parts are subjected to debinding and sintering . 
A limiting factor of this process is the debinding step , usually done thermally . 
Long thermal cycles are required to avoid defects such as cracks and blisters caused by trapped pyrolysis products . 
The current study addresses this issue by developing a novel FFF binder formulation for the production of zirconia parts with an intermediate solvent debinding step . 
Different unfilled binder systems were evaluated considering the mechanical and rheological properties required for the FFF process together with the solvent debinding performance of the parts . 
Subsequently , the same compounds were used in feedstocks filled with 47 vol. 
% of zirconia powder , and the resulting morphology was studied . 
Finally , the most promising formulation , containing zirconia , styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene copolymer , paraffin wax , stearic acid , and acrylic acid-grafted high density polyethylene was successfully processed by FFF . 
After solvent debinding , 55.4 wt. 
% of the binder was dissolved in cyclohexane , creating an interconnected porosity of 29 vol. 
% that allowed a successful thermal debinding and subsequent pre-sintering . 
The layered structure of Additive Manufacturing processes results in a stair- stepping effect of the surface topographies . 
In general , the impact of this effect strongly depends on the build angle of a surface , whereas the overall surface roughness is additionally caused by the resolution of the specific AM process . 
The aim of this work is the prediction of the surface quality in dependence of the building orientation of a part . 
These results can finally be used to optimize the orientation to get a desired surface quality . 
As not all parts of the component surface are equally important , a preselection of areas can be used to improve the overall surface quality of relevant areas . 
The model uses the digital AMF format of a part . 
Each triangle is assigned with a roughness value and by testing different orientations the best one can be found . 
This approach needs a database for the surface qualities . 
This must be done separately for each Additive Manufacturing process and is shown exemplarily with a surface topography simulation for the laser sintering process.A validation of the model is done with a monitor bracket of EOS GmbH . 
Measurements of five different orientations of the part , optimized according selected surface areas , show a good accordance between the real surface roughness and the predicted roughness of the simulation . 
3D printing using the materials extrusion additive manufacturing ( ME-AM ) process is highly nonisothermal . 
In this process , a solid polymer filament is mechanically drawn into a heated hot end ( liquefier ) where the polymer is ideally melted to a viscous liquid . 
This melt is extruded through an orifice using applied pressure of the solid filament that is continuously being drawn into the extruder . 
The extruded filament melt is deposited to build up the desired part . 
The poor thermal conductivity of most polymers inevitably leads to temperature gradients , in both the radial and axial directions . 
Here we quantify the temperature evolution of the polymer filament in axial direction using embedded fine thermocouples as a function of process parameters . 
Information about the radial gradients is obtained by introducing dye markers within the filament through understanding the flow behavior through the extruder by the deformation of the dye from a linear to pseudo parabolic profile . 
The polymer is heated above the glass transition temperature for less than 30 s for reasonable print conditions with the center of the filament remaining cooler than the liquefier temperature throughout the process . 
These process measurements provide critical data to enable improved simulation and modeling of the ME-AM process and the properties of the printed parts . 
Dendrites built from elongated cells lead to a dislocation cell structure After a solution heat treatment the dislocation density is significantly decreased Nitrided AM structures can be built to match the properties of conventional 316 L A solution treatment prevents CrN precipitation by eliminating stress A solution treatment plus nitriding are beneficial for corrosion and wear properties Due to the limited wear and corrosion properties of the austenitic stainless steel AISI 316 L , some applications require the benefits of nitriding . 
The aim of this work was to investigate whether the same positive effect of nitriding could be obtained for 316 L that was additive manufactured using the laser powder-bed fusion process and further solution treated at 1060 °C for 30 min , low-temperature plasma nitrided at 430 °C or both . 
This study was designed to better understand the additive-manufactured and solution-treated microstructures as well as developing a nitride and a diffusion layer . 
The comparison of the wear and corrosion resistance , the microhardness and the microstructure changes of the additive-manufactured steel in different post-treated conditions with a commercial steel was carried out . 
It was found that the post-treated low-temperature plasma nitriding improves the wear and corrosion resistance of the additive-manufactured samples . 
The obtained values are similar to the values of conventionally fabricated and nitrided 316 L. The solution treating itself ( without further nitriding ) did not have any significant impact on these properties . 
It was possible to explain the microstructure at the nano level as well as correlating the wear and corrosion properties . 
Control of laser power to improve part quality is critical for fabrication of complex components via Laser Powder Bed Fusion ( LPBF ) additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes . 
If the laser power is too low , it will result in a small melt pool and lack of fusion ; on the other hand , if the laser power is too high , it will result in keyhole and material evaporation . 
This paper examines a model-based feed-forward control for laser power in LPBF to improve build quality by avoiding the onset of keyhole formation or reducing over-melting . 
First , an analytical , control-oriented model on the dynamics of melt-pool cross-sectional area in scanning a multi-track part was developed , and then a nonlinear inverse-dynamics controller was designed to adjust laser power such that the melt-pool cross-sectional area can be regulated to a constant set point during the build process . 
The resulting control trajectory on laser power from the simulated closed-loop controller was then implemented in a LPBF process as a feed-forward ( FF ) controller for laser power . 
Multiple bead-on-plate samples of Inconel 625 , with different number of tracks and track lengths , were then built on an EOSINT M 280 AM system to evaluate the performance of the resulting FF-Analytic controller . 
Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed FF-Analytic control of laser power was able to avoid the onset of keyhole formation that occurred under a constant laser power for certain samples . 
Furthermore , the proposed FF-Analytic control was demonstrated to have significantly reduced over-melting at the returning ends of the laser scan path in scanning a multi-track part compared to applying a constant laser power , albeit with some over-compensation due to modeling imperfection . 
Overall , the proposed FF-Analytic control of laser power had 23–40 % lower average error rate than applying a constant laser power in regulating the melt-pool cross-sectional area to a constant reference value , in terms of measurements of cross-sections at track ends . 
Forming quality was compared for AM-built-IN718 samples using two types of powders . 
Samples built with imperfect spherical powders tend to be porous and uneven . 
Processing with spherical powders has a broad process window suppressing defect . 
High cooling and solidification rates suppress the interdendritic void formation . 
The characteristics of powder applied in electron beam powder-bed fusion ( EB-PBF ) play a vital role in the process stability and final part performance . 
We use two types of Inconel 718 alloy powders for experiments , namely , ( i ) imperfect spherical and ( ii ) spherical powders . 
They have similar particle size distributions but are different in geometry and built-in defect . 
The forming qualities concerning surface topography , density , and internal defect of the EB-PBF-built samples prepared using two types of powders are characterized under the same processing conditions . 
In particular , the forming qualities are further compared under the optimal process condition to highlight the decisive role of powder features . 
Notably , different powder geometries with distinct surface feature inevitably affect the heat transfer during melting . 
The significance of powder feedstock characteristics in defect suppression is clarified with the aid of numerical simulations . 
The experimental results show that compared to spherical powders , fabrication using imperfect spherical powders is more likely to evoke lack–of–fusion and excessive melting under low and high energy conditions , respectively . 
Thus , spherical powders have a broader process window in ensuring a higher density and smoother surface than that of imperfect spherical powders . 
Moreover , in the sample built with spherical powders , the high cooling and solidification rates evaluated by numerical simulations result in the suppression of the interdendritic voids . 
The use of feedstocks from metal injection molding ( MIM ) for the additive manufacturing ( AM ) of green parts , which are then debound and sintered in a process called shaping , debinding , and sintering ( SDS ) , is promising in terms of production costs of metallic parts . 
However , in order to use the cost-efficient AM technique fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) for SDS , powder-binder mixtures known for MIM feedstocks must be adapted to filament requirements resulting in adjustments to debinding and sintering . 
In contrast to FFF , screw-based material extrusion is capable of processing already available MIM feedstocks , but machine costs are high due to complex print heads . 
In this work , a new process called piston-based feedstock fabrication ( PFF ) is developed for processing already available MIM feedstocks at comparable costs to FFF . 
First , the state of the art is reviewed highlighting the potential of piston-based material extrusion for its usage in SDS . 
Experimental studies are performed to validate the developed PFF printer . 
As material , a Ti-6Al-4V MIM feedstock is used . 
Thresholds for piston speed ( 0.175 mm/min ) , extrusion temperature ( 80 °C ) , and nozzle diameter ( 0.4 mm ) are determined to ensure a viscosity that allows to control the extrusion process via steps per mm . 
With these thresholds it is found that a constant extrusion process can be established in a filling range of the cylinder up to 155 mm . 
Finally , the performance of the PFF system is evaluated in terms of nozzle geometry , print speed , and reproducibility showing that reproducible green part properties are achieved at a maximum speed of 8.18 mm/s while using a tapered FFF nozzle . 
A thermo-mechanical model of directed energy deposition additive manufacturing of Ti–6Al–4V is developed using measurements of the surface convection generated by gasses flowing during the deposition . 
In directed energy deposition , material is injected into a melt pool that is traversed to fill in a cross-section of a part , building it layer-by-layer . 
This creates large thermal gradients that generate plastic deformation and residual stresses . 
Finite element analysis ( FEA ) is often used to study these phenomena using simple assumptions of the surface convection . 
This work proposes that a detailed knowledge of the surface heat transfer is required to produce more accurate FEA results . 
The surface convection generated by the deposition process is measured and implemented in the thermo-mechanical model . 
Three depositions with different geometries and dwell times are used to validate the model using in situ measurements of the temperature and deflection as well as post-process measurements of the residual stress . 
An additional model is developed using the assumption of free convection on all surfaces . 
The results show that a measurement-based convection model is required to produce accurate simulation results . 
Easily segregated Cu-15Ni-8Sn alloy bulk material was fabricated using a selective laser melting ( SLM ) process . 
The microstructure of SLM-manufactured Cu-15Ni-8Sn alloy was investigated using optical microscopy ( OM ) , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . 
Differences in the microstructures and elemental segregation of gas-atomized alloy powder , cast ingots , and SLM-manufactured samples were analyzed . 
The statistical average grain size of the SLM-manufactured Cu-15Ni-8Sn alloy was 4.03 μm . 
Microstructures of the SLM-manufactured sample were mainly composed of epitaxially grown slender cellular structures with submicron widths . 
Microsegregation was detected by TEM , and 80- to 200-nm Sn-enriched precipitates were dispersed between cellullar structures . 
Many dislocations and dislocation tangles appeared around the precipitates . 
An EBSD test revealed that most local misorientations within 3 degrees were concentrated in fusion line regions . 
Compared with cast ingots , the yield strength Rp0.2 , ultimate tensile strength Rm , elongation A , and elastic modulus E of the SLM-manufactured sample increased by 67 % , 24.6 % , 360 % , and 7 % , respectively . 
Moreover , the SLM-manufactured Cu-15Ni-8Sn alloy could be directly aged at 350℃ for 12 h , reaching Rm = 991.1 MPa and A =3 % , with no need for solid solution treatment or cold working . 
A method for modeling the effect of stress relaxation at high temperatures during laser direct energy deposition processes is experimentally validated for Ti-6Al-4V samples subject to different inter-layer dwell times . 
The predicted mechanical responses are compared to those of Inconel® 625 samples , which experience no allotropic phase transformation , deposited under identical process conditions . 
The thermal response of workpieces in additive manufacturing is known to be strongly dependent on dwell time . 
In this work the dwell times used vary from 0 to 40 s. Based on past research on ferretic steels and the additive manufacturing of titanium alloys it is assumed that the effect of transformation strain in Ti-6Al-4V acts to oppose all other strain components , effectively eliminating all residual stress at temperatures above 690 °C . 
The model predicts that Inconel® 625 exhibits increasing distortion with decreasing dwell times but that Ti-6Al-4V displays the opposite behavior , with distortion dramatically decreasing with lowering dwell time . 
These predictions are accurate when compared with experimental in situ and post-process measurements . 
The present study demonstrates for the first time a unique UK-designed and built Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) hybrid system that combines polymer based structural deposition with digital deposition of electrically conductive elements . 
This innovative manufacturing system is based on a multi-planar build approach to improve on many of the limitations associated with AM , such as poor surface finish , low geometric tolerance and poor robustness . 
Specifically , the approach involves a multi-planar Material Extrusion ( ME ) process in which separated build stations with up to 5 axes of motion replace traditional horizontally-sliced layer modelling . 
The construction of multi-material architectures also involved using multiple print systems in order to combine both ME and digital deposition of conductive material . 
To demonstrate multi-material 3D Printing ( 3DP ) we used three thermoplastics to print specimens , on top of which a unique Ag nano-particulate ink was printed using a non-contact jetting process , during which drop characteristics such as shape , velocity , and volume were assessed using a bespoke drop watching system . 
Electrical analysis of printed conductive tracks on polymer surfaces was performed during mechanical testing ( static tensile and flexural testing and dynamic fatigue testing ) to assess robustness of the printed circuits . 
Both serpentine and straight line patterns were used in the testing of Ag particle loaded ink and they showed very similar resistance changes during mechanical exposure . 
Monitored resistance and stress changed as a function of strain exhibiting hysteresis with more prominent residual strain during stretching and compression cycles and 3-point bending flexural tests of PA and CoPA substrates . 
Bare and encapsulated tracks exhibited low electrical resistivity ( 1–3*10−6 Ω*m ) , and its change was more rapid on ABS and minor on PA and CoPA when increasing tensile and flexural strain up to 1.2 % and 0.8 % , respectively . 
Resistance of Ag tracks on ABS also increased rapidly during fatigue testing and the tracks easily fractured during repeated stretching-compression cycles at 1 % and 1.2 % strain . 
No resistance changes of Ag tracks printed on PA and CoPA were observed at lower strain amplitudes whereas at higher strain amplitudes these changes were the lowest for conductive tracks on CoPA . 
Thermal analyses were conducted to determine the printed material ’ s glass transition temperature ( Tg ) , stability and degradation behavior to find the optimum annealing conditions post printing . 
The novel AM printer has the ability to fabricate fully functional objects in one build , including integrated printed circuitry and embedded electronics . 
This new technology also gives the opportunity for designers to improve existing products , as well as create new products with the added advantages of geometrically unconstrained 3DP . 
This paper proposes computational models of the direct energy deposition and powder bed fusion processes developed for process control applications . 
Both models are built upon a regression metamodel of heat transfer beneath the laser beam , to which an auxiliary thermal model is added to account for residual heat in track-to-track interactions . 
Both models are coupled by taking temperatures predicted with the auxiliary model and incorporating them as initial conditions for metamodel predictions of future laser scans . 
The synergy of the metamodel and the auxiliary model creates a high-fidelity model , which is used to generate training data for a model-free optimal controller . 
Simulation results prove the capability of the proposed optimal controller to adjust scan speed to control temperature when accounting for track-to-track interactions . 
One of the serious obstacles preventing wide industrial use of additive manufacturing ( AM ) in metals and alloys is a lack of materials available for this technology . 
It is particularly true for the Electron Beam Melting ( EBM® ) process , where only a few materials are commercially available , which significantly limits the use of the method . 
One of the dominant trends in AM today is developing processes for technological materials already widely used by other methods and developed for other industrial applications , gaining further advantages through the unique value added by additive manufacturing . 
Developing new materials specifically for additive manufacturing that can utilize the properties and specifics of the method in full is still a research and development subject , and such materials are yet far from full scale industrial usage . 
Stainless steels are widely used in industry due to good mechanical properties , corrosion resistance and low cost of material . 
Hence , there is potentially a market for this material and one possible business driver compared with casting for example is that lead times could be cut drastically by utilizing an additive approach for one-off or small series production . 
This paper presents results from the additive manufacturing of components from the known alloy 316L using EBM® . 
Previously the samples of 316L were made by laser-based AM technology . 
This work was performed as a part of the large project with the long term aim to use additively manufactured components in a nuclear fusion reactor . 
Components and test samples successfully made from 316L stainless steel using EBM® process show promising mechanical properties , density and hardness compared to its counterpart made by powder metallurgy ( hot isostatic pressing , HIP ) . 
As with the other materials made by EBM® process , 316L samples show rather low porosity . 
Present paper also reports on the hierarchical microstructure features of the 316L material processed by EBM® characterized by optical and electron microscopy . 
Roles of heat treatment and build direction are analyzed for SLM IN718 . 
The strength and anisotropic characteristics is explained via microstructure . 
High resolution tomography displays the prevalence of near surface porosity . 
Strain partitioning is observed based on the γ ’ ’ precipitates diffraction spots . 
The benefits of additive manufacturing have been well documented , but prior to these materials being used in critical applications , the deformation mechanisms must be properly characterized . 
In this work , the role of heat treatment and build orientation of selective laser melting IN718 is investigated through detailed characterization . 
The microstructure of this material is probed through a combination of electron microscopy to identify the precipitate structure , electron backscatter diffraction to quantify the grain-level features , and synchrotron-based X-ray microcomputed tomography to detect porosity . 
A high degree of porosity is observed spatially near the free surface of the part , where the contour during the build process meets the interior hatch . 
Further , microstructure based deformation mechanisms are explored through digital image correlation relative to the grain features after monotonic and cyclic loading and in situ high-energy X-ray diffraction to identify the lattice strain evolution in these materials . 
Demarcations between the behaviors of the as-built versus post-processed materials are discussed ; specifically , in terms of anisotropy with respect to build direction and values of the strength properties , based on the grain morphology , coherent twin formation , and precipitate structure . 
Lastly , the presence of dislocation sub-structures within the grains is observed to homogenize deformation within the as-built sample , while strain partitioning is observed during loading of the post-processed sample . 
A process is presented for the rapid production of microstructured monofilaments via thermal drawing of additively manufactured polymer preforms . 
Preforms are produced wholly , or in part , via fused filament fabrication of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene ( ABS ) and polycarbonate materials . 
Example monofilaments include “ microprinted ” monofilaments that contain an arbitrary image embedded in the monofilament cross section ; microfluidic monofilaments in which flow channels are formed by combining optically transparent and opaque materials ; dual-material monofilaments that combine ABS and polycarbonate into a regular spoked geometry with five-fold symmetry ; and a microfluidic preform co-fed with glass optical fiber , allowing both fluid and light transmission through the monofilament . 
The primary advantages of this monofilament fabrication technique include short lead times ; minimal investment in materials and equipment ; a means of directly combining multiple materials into a single monofilament , even if the material components have different thermorheological properties ; and the ability to create arbitrary and complex geometries . 
Energy system components with embedded sensors , or smart parts , can be a pathway in obtaining real-time system performance feedback and in situ monitoring during operation . 
Traditional surface contact or cavity placed sensors increase the possibility of disturbing the normal operation of energy systems due to changes in part design required for sensor placement . 
The fabrication of smart parts using additive manufacturing ( AM ) technology can allow the flexibility of embedding a sensor within a structure without compromising the structure and/or functionality . 
The embedding of a sensor within a desired location allows an end user the ability to monitor specific critical regions that are of interest such as high temperature and pressure ( e.g. 
, combustor inlet conditions that can reach up to 810 K and 2760 kPa ) . 
In addition , the non-intrusive placement of the sensor within a part ’ s body can increase the sensor ’ s life span by isolating the sensor from the aforementioned harsh operating environments . 
This paper focuses on the fabrication of smart parts using electron beam melting ( EBM ) AM technology as well as the characterization of the sensor ’ s functionality . 
The development of a “ stop and go ” process was explored that comprised of pausing a part ’ s fabrication process to allow the placement of piezoelectric ceramic material into pre-designed cavities within a part ’ s body , and resuming the process to complete the final product . 
A compression test was performed on the smart parts fabricated using EBM to demonstrate the sensor ’ s capability of sensing external forces . 
A maximum sensing voltage response of approximately 3 V was detected with a maximum pressure not exceeding 40 MPa . 
This research work demonstrates the feasibility of fabricating smart parts with embedded sensors without the need of post-processing ( e.g. 
, CNC machining and polishing ) . 
In addition , the sensing capability of monitoring a component ’ s performance has been validated , leading to the possibility of fabricating other smart parts that could impact industries such as energy , aerospace , automotive , and biomedical industries for applications like air/fuel pre-mixing , pressure tubes , and turbine blades . 
Recycling metal powders in the Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) process is an important consideration in affordability with reference to traditional manufacturing . 
Metal powder recyclability has been studied before with respect to change in chemical composition of powders , effect on mechanical properties of produced parts , effect on flowability of powders and powder morphology . 
In this paper , we propose a data-driven method to understand in situ behavior of recycled powder on the build platform . 
Our method is based on comprehensive analysis of log file data from various sensors used in the process of printing metal parts in the Arcam Electron Beam Melting ( EBM ) ® system . 
Using rake position data and rake sensor pulse data collected during Arcam builds , we found that Inconel 718 powders exhibit additional powder spreading operations with increased reuse cycles compared to Ti-6Al-4V powders . 
We substantiate differences found in in situ behavior of Ti-6Al-4V and Inconel 718 powders using known sintering behavior of the two powders . 
The novelty of this work lies in the new approach to understanding powder behavior especially spreadability using in situ log file data that is regularly collected in Arcam EBM® builds rather than physical testing of parts and powders post build . 
In addition to studying powder recyclability , the proposed methodology has potential to be extended generically to monitor powder behavior in AM processes . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) provides an economic approach to manufacturing Ni-base superalloy components for high-pressure gas turbines as well as repairing damaged blade sections during operation . 
In this study , two advanced processing routes are combined : SLM , to fabricate small specimens of the nonweldable CMSX-4 , and hot isostatic pressing ( HIP ) with a rapid cooling rate as post-processing to heal defects while the target γ/γ´ microstructure is developed . 
An initial parametric study is carried out to investigate the influence of the SLM process parameters on the microstructure and defects occurring during SLM . 
Special emphasis is placed on understanding and characterizing the as-built SLM microstructures by means of high-resolution characterization techniques . 
The post-processing heat treatment is then optimized with respect to segregation and the γ/γ´ microstructure . 
This article proposes a new method for reducing the amount of support material required for 3-D printing of complex designs generated by topology optimization . 
This procedure relies on solving sequentially two structural optimization problems – the first on a discrete truss-based model and the second on a continuum-based model . 
In the optimization of the discrete model , the maximum overhang limitation is imposed based on geometrical parameters . 
The optimized discrete pattern is then projected on to the continuum so that it influences the material distribution in the continuum optimization . 
Numerical results indicate that the designs obtained by this approach exhibit improved printability as they have fewer overhanging features . 
In some cases , practically no supporting material will be required for printing the optimized design . 
The importance of additive manufacturing ( AM ) to the future of product design and manufacturing infrastructure demands educational programs tailored to embrace its fundamental principles and its innovative potential . 
The lectures begin with in-depth technical analysis of the major AM processes and machine technologies , then focus on special topics including design methods , machine controls , applications of AM to major industry needs , and emerging processes and materials . 
In lab sessions , students operate and characterize desktop AM machines , and work in teams to design and fabricate a bridge having maximum strength per unit weight while conforming to geometric constraints . 
In a single semester of the course , teams created prototype machines for 3D printing of molten glass , 3D printing of soft-serve ice cream , robotic deposition of biodegradable material , direct-write deposition of continuous carbon fiber composites , large-area parallel extrusion of polymers , and in situ optical scanning during 3D printing . 
Several of these projects led to patent applications , follow-on research , and peer-reviewed publications . 
We conclude that AM education , while arguably rooted in mechanical engineering , is truly multidisciplinary , and that education programs must embrace this context . 
A novel soft mold casting method for metal part fabrication is developed . 
The paste can be utilized with direct paste printing and soft mold casting . 
Three-dimensional metal parts can be obtained with good geometric precision . 
Recently , additive manufacturing ( AM ) of metals has enjoyed significant advancement . 
While the mainstream AM methods utilize high-energy power beams to melt metal powders , other low-cost alternatives are also being developed ( e.g. 
, direct ink printing ) . 
In this study , a copper powder-binder paste is developed , which is not only capable to be used for direct printing , but also to be cast using soft molds . 
Dense three-dimensional parts can be obtained by sintering green bodies . 
The electrical and mechanical properties of the sintered samples are evaluated by conductivity , hardness measurements and tensile tests , respectively . 
The results are comparable to other powder processed copper materials . 
The properties of 3-D printed polymeric parts depend significantly on the processing conditions under which they are fabricated . 
This study aims to determine how the use of low-pressure additive manufacturing ( AM ) processing conditions , influences the mechanical performance of printed polymeric parts . 
This polymer material extrusion ( PME ) study was carried out using an open-source desktop printer , under both low pressure ( 1 Pa ) and at atmospheric pressure . 
The printing study was carried out using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS ) , polylactic acid ( PLA ) and a nylon co-polymer ( PA6 ) . 
The resultant polymer parts were compared based on their printed mass , density , volume , porosity , surface energy , ATR-IR analysis and thermal properties ( DSC ) . 
As expected only minor differences in chemical functionality were observed between parts printed under the two processing pressures . 
Under low-pressure printing conditions , the polymer parts exhibited some physical changes , when compared to those , printed under atmospheric conditions , such as an increase in density and a decrease in porosity . 
Comparing low-pressure printed type V dog bones ( ASTM D-638 ) , with those printed at atmospheric pressure , it was observed that the ABS , PLA and PA6 exhibited an increase in Ultimate Tensile Strength of 9 % , 13 % and 42 % respectively . 
It is proposed that the superior mechanical properties obtained for polymers printed under low pressure conditions , may be due to a combination of two factors . 
These are the reduction in porosity of the printed part and the reduction in heat loss at the printed polymer surface , yielding enhanced bonding between the polymer layers . 
In a further printing study carried out at atmospheric pressure in a nitrogen atmosphere , it was also demonstrated that any oxidation of the polymer layers during printing , did not significantly influence the mechanical properties of the resultant printed parts . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes are used to build structural components layer-by-layer . 
Cold spray is considered an AM process , whereby particles impact a substrate at high velocities to generate the deposition layer . 
Effect of spray angles on bonding strength at the cold spray deposit and substrate interface was experimentally investigated . 
The results showed that bonding strength increased with decreasing spray angle from the normal direction ( 90° spray angle ) , and the maximum bonding strength was observed at 45° spray angle ; however , the deposition efficiency and strength of the bulk deposit material decreased with decreasing spray angle . 
3D finite element modeling of single-particle impact combined with experimental observation of “ splat ” deposits was conducted to understand bonding process under different spray angles . 
The relationships between parameters contributing bonding formations ( e.g. 
, plastic deformation and temperature rise due to impact ) and processing parameters ( e.g. 
, spray angles , impact velocity , pre-heating temperature ) were established and discussed . 
These relationships are useful for understanding bonding mechanisms and strengths of deposits sprayed at different angles and can be used to define an optimized spray angle . 
The modeling results also revealed that increasing particle impact velocity and pre-heating temperature promoted deposit quality , but in different respects . 
Finally , the influence of different primary accelerating gases ( helium vs nitrogen ) on the material properties of the deposits was investigated . 
The tensile testing showed that fully dense deposits produced with different gases had similar stiffness and yield strength , but different ductility . 
The particle impact model was further used to explain the different material behaviors , which also demonstrated feasibility to connect the spray parameters and the material properties via modeling for optimizing cold spray process . 
Lithography-based additive manufacturing ( AM ) is increasingly becoming the technology of choice for the small series or single unit production . 
At the TU Vienna a digital light processing ( DLP ) system was developed for the fabrication of complex technical ceramics , requiring high levels of detail and accuracy . 
The DLP-system used in this study creates a ceramic green part by stacking up layers of a photo-curable resin with a solid loading of around 45 vol. 
% zirconia . 
After a thermal debinding and sintering step the part turns into a dense ceramic and gains its final properties . 
The native resolution of the DLP process depends on the light engine 's DMD ( digital mirror device ) chip and the optics employed . 
Currently it is possible to print 3D-structures with a spatial resolution down to 40 μm . 
A modification of the light source allows for the customization of the light curing strategy for each pixel of the exposed layers . 
This work presents methods to improve the geometrical accuracy as well as the structural properties of the final 3D-printed ceramic part by using the full capabilities of the light source . 
On the one hand , the feasibility to control the dimensional overgrowth to gain resolution below the native resolution of the light engine—a sub-pixel resolution—was evaluated . 
Overgrowth occurs due to light scattering and was found to be sensitive to both exposure time and exposed area . 
On the other hand , different light curing strategies ( LCSs ) and depths of cure ( Cd ) were used for the 3D-printing of ceramic green parts and their influence on cracks in the final ceramic was evaluated . 
It was concluded that softstart LCSs , as well as higher values for Cd , reduce cracks in the final ceramic . 
Applying these findings within the 3D-printing process may be another step toward flawless and highly accurate ceramic parts . 
Direct additive manufacturing of ceramics using melt cast route . 
Fabrication of compositionally gradient ceramic-metal structure in one additive manufacturing operation . 
Characterization and defect analysis of AM processed parts . 
Laser Engineered Net Shaping ( LENS™ ) , which is a laser based additive manufacturing method , was utilized to fabricate Ti-Al2O3 compositionally graded structures . 
The Ti-Al2O3 graded composites consisted of different sections −Ti6Al4V alloy , Ti6Al4V + Al2O3 composites , and pure Al2O3 ceramic . 
After LENS™ processing , microstructural characterization , phase analysis , elemental distribution , and microhardness measurements were performed on the cross sections of Ti-Al2O3 graded composites . 
Each section had their unique microstructures and phases . 
Moreover , hardness measurements demonstrated that the pure Al2O3 section had the highest hardness of 2365.5 ± 64.7 HV0.3 . 
Conventional ceramic processing requires extensive post-processing including high temperature sintering , which makes it difficult for direct fabrication of metal-ceramic multi-layer structures . 
The results demonstrate that LENS™ can be utilized to process multi-material metal ceramic composites in a single step while maintaining the size , shape and compositional variations based on computer aided design files . 
Since this is a first-generation work , and limited research results are available in published literature related to LENS™ processing of both metals and ceramics in one operation , the demonstration of this work is expected to inspire future studies on manufacturing of multi-material composites using AM . 
A rather simple computational analysis for the thermomechanical simulation of the EBM is presented . 
A new model is provided to account the powder bed behaviour during the melting . 
Shrinkage and porosity for both powder and bulk materials are considered . 
Experimental validations support strongly the effectiveness of the proposed model . 
The proposed approach might be useful for other powder-based AM processes as well . 
In this work , an improved but still rather simple computational analysis is presented for a more detailed prediction of Electron Beam Melting ( EBM ) process outcomes . 
A fully coupled thermomechanical analysis is developed in which nonlinearities due to the variation of material properties when the material melts are included . 
A new analytical approach is developed to emulate the volume variation of the powder bed during heating and melting . 
Particularly , the expansion of the powder particles and the porosity reduction within the powder bed are considered simultaneously . 
The thermal expansion and the shrinkage of solid material during heating and cooling and the stress formation within the solid material are also modelled . 
The model can predict the geometrical transformation of the powder into solid material in an efficient way . 
A comparison between experimental and simulated cross-sectional areas of melted single lines is presented . 
Both continues line melting and fractional line melting , multi beam melting , are considered . 
The model shows a good ability to provide consistent and accurate forecasts . 
The main goal of this work is the adoption of additive manufacturing for the production of inexpensive rare-earth free MnAl-based permanent magnets . 
The use of more advanced binder-free additive manufacturing technique such as Electron Beam Melting ( EBM ) allows obtaining fully-dense magnetic materials with advanced topology and complex shapes . 
We focus on the feasibility of controlling the phase formation in additively manufactured Mn-Al alloys by employing post-manufacturing heat treatment . 
The as-manufactured EBM samples contain 8 % of the desired ferromagnetic τ-MnAl phase . 
After the optimized annealing treatment , the content of the τ-phase was increased to 90 % . 
This sample has a coercivity value of 0.15 T , which is also the maximum achieved in conventionally produced binary MnAl magnets . 
Moreover , the EBM samples are fully dense and have the same density as the samples produced by conventional melting density . 
A modelling strategy is proposed to evaluate the influence of defect morphology on the fatigue limit of additively manufactured Al alloys by : ( i ) obtaining an x-ray micro-Computed Tomography ( μ-CT ) 3D image of the material , ( ii ) computing the Equivalent Inertia Ellipsoid of each individual pore , ( iii ) modelling the influence of the defect on the fatigue limit through the Defect Stress Gradient ( DSG ) approach coupled to the Eshelby theory and , ( iv ) 3D mapping the criticality of each individual defect . 
For this fatigue study , an AlSi10Mg alloy was manufactured by laser powder bed fusion using sub-optimal deposition parameters in order to produce large lack-of-fusion defects . 
After a T6 heat treatment , tension-compression fatigue tests , with R = −1 , were conducted on specimens oriented with their loading axis either parallel or normal to the Z-axis of the additive manufacturing equipment . 
Two samples were characterised before μ-CT testing in order to characterise the initial 3D defect population . 
Each sample was fatigued step by step in order to determine the fatigue limit . 
The fracture surface was observed in order to identify the critical defect in the initial μ-CT image . 
A comparison with the fatigue results led to the following conclusions : ( i ) when the longest axis of the defect is perpendicular to the loading axis , modelling the defect as an equivalent inertia prolate ellipsoid gives better results ( 5 % error on the fatigue limit ) than modelling it as a simple equivalent sphere ( 22 % error on the fatigue limit ) , ( ii ) the prolate ellipsoid is not relevant when the longest axis of the defect is oriented along the loading axis ; in this case an oblate equivalent ellipsoid should be used , ( iii ) the concept of ‘ size ’ for a complex 3D shaped defect should be linked to the inertia and the loading , ( iv ) with this approach , surface defects are shown to be more critical than internal ones for fatigue life and , ( v ) a 3D defect criticality map of the entire sample can be plotted to provide visual feedback on which defects are the most critical for fatigue life . 
In common thermoplastic additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes , a solid polymer filament is melted , extruded though a rastering nozzle , welded onto neighboring layers and solidified . 
The temperature of the polymer at each of these stages is the key parameter governing these non-equilibrium processes , but due to its strong spatial and temporal variations , it is difficult to measure accurately . 
Here we utilize infrared ( IR ) imaging – in conjunction with necessary reflection corrections and calibration procedures – to measure these temperature profiles of a model polymer during 3D printing . 
From the temperature profiles of the printed layer ( road ) and sublayers , the temporal profile of the crucially important weld temperatures can be obtained . 
Under typical printing conditions , the weld temperature decreases at a rate of approximately 100 °C/s and remains above the glass transition temperature for approximately 1 s. These measurement methods are a first step in the development of strategies to control and model the printing processes and in the ability to develop models that correlate critical part strength with material and processing parameters . 
A novel compulsively constricted wire arc additive manufacturing（CC-WAAM）method was proposed with arc and droplets ejected out of a narrow space . 
Small-size liquid droplets were transferred to previous layer with stable path and direction with low heat input . 
Good shielding and heat preservation for high-temperature liquid droplets as well as the liquid pool were guaranteed by the ejected arc plasma . 
Uniform and fine microstructures were achieved in the deposited metal using mild steel filler wire in CC-WAAM . 
In order to realize oriented wire and arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) featured by low heat input and small droplets , a novel compulsively constricted WAAM ( CC-WAAM ) method was proposed and investigated in this paper . 
The arc burned between a metallic wire and a tungsten electrode in a narrow-space nozzle . 
The proposed technology could provide compulsive constriction for arc plasma and liquid metal droplets using a cubic boron nitride ( CBN ) ceramic nozzle . 
The surrounding arc was ejected out of the nozzle and offered extra heating and a good shielding environment during the whole manufacturing process . 
The arc and metal transfer behaviors could be improved for better performance and higher quality . 
The economic and efficient new method is expected to solve the challenges faced by traditional WAAM such as excessive heat input and poor geometrical accuracy . 
Preliminary experiments showed that the two AM layers produced by the novel method had homogeneous microstructure distribution and fine grains . 
The geometrical dimensions of each layer can be effectively controlled by regulating the travel speed of the torch . 
The wide-range adjustable heat input can effectively control the state of the metallic formation , making it possible to realize an accurate control of the microstructure and properties . 
Residual stress distribution in cold spray microparticles for additive manufacturing is studied . 
A simulation model for cold-spray additive manufacturing based on arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian method is proposed . 
The residual stress formation mechanism in cold-spray additive manufacturing is explained in detail . 
Cold spray ( CS ) residual stress was measured by the X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) and contour methods . 
The residual stress components SX and SY , perpendicular to the thickness , have similar distributions and approximately equal magnitudes . 
Both are compressive on the deposited surface and become tensile inside the structure . 
An advanced simulation model based on the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian ( ALE ) method was developed to investigate the residual stress distributions in a single CS microparticle and multi-layer CS microparticles and reveal the formation mechanism . 
The residual stress components SX and SY predicted by the proposed simulation model have the same distribution as shown by the measurements , i.e. 
, compressive on the surface and tensile inside . 
As the number of deposition layers increases , the position of maximum tensile stress moves from the substrate to the deposited layers . 
The residual stress component SZ in the direction of the deposition thickness shows alternate tensile and compressive distributions in the transverse direction , which is quite different from that of the transverse component . 
The present work provides a guideline for effectively tailoring the residual stress in CS parts and thereby improving the fatigue lifetime . 
Because many of the most important defects in Laser Powder Bed Fusion ( L-PBF ) occur at the size and timescales of the melt pool itself , the development of methodologies for monitoring the melt pool is critical . 
This works examines the possibility of in-situ detection of keyholing porosity and balling instabilities . 
Specifically , a visible-light high speed camera with a fixed field of view is used to study the morphology of L-PBF melt pools in the Inconel 718 material system . 
A scale-invariant description of melt pool morphology is constructed using Computer Vision techniques and unsupervised Machine Learning is used to differentiate between observed melt pools . 
By observing melt pools produced across process space , in-situ signatures are identified which may indicate flaws such as those observed ex-situ . 
This linkage of ex-situ and in-situ morphology enabled the use of supervised Machine Learning to classify melt pools observed ( with the high speed camera ) during fusion of non-bulk geometries such as overhangs . 
The ability to deposit a consistent and predictable solidification microstructure can greatly accelerate additive manufacturing ( AM ) process qualification . 
Process mapping is an approach that represents process outcomes in terms of process variables . 
In this work , a solidification microstructure process map was developed using finite element analysis for deposition of single beads of Ti-6Al-4V via electron beam wire feed AM processes . 
Process variable combinations yielding constant beta grain size and morphology were identified . 
Comparison with a previously developed process map for melt pool geometry shows that maintaining a constant melt pool cross sectional area will also yield a constant grain size . 
Additionally , the grain morphology boundaries are similar to curves of constant melt pool aspect ratio . 
Experimental results support the numerical predictions and identify a proportional size scaling between beta grain widths and melt pool widths . 
Results further demonstrate that in situ indirect control of solidification microstructure is possible through direct melt pool dimension control . 
The effects of electron beam manufactured ( EBM ) process-induced defects on local microstructural failure initiation and propagation in IN 718 have been investigated . 
Predictions for transgranular fracture , based on local cleavage plane stresses , and for intergranular fracture , based on dislocation-grain boundary ( GB ) interactions and evolving dislocation pileups , were combined with a crystalline dislocation-density plasticity approach to understand the influence of AM process-induced defects , such as porosity , NbC precipitates , and regions of dry powder . 
High local stresses along the peripheries of pores caused crack nucleation , and mismatches in deformation behavior between NbC precipitates and the surrounding matrix led to local stress gradients that induced crack nucleation and decohesion at precipitate/matrix interfaces . 
Regions of unmelted powder had significant stress accumulations that initiated failure at low nominal strains . 
Failure due to high localized stresses near regions of unmelted powder was dominant over precipitate/matrix decohesion and crack nucleation near pore peripheries . 
Based on the predictions , the mechanical behavior of AM alloys is governed by local dislocation-density evolution near process-induced defects , which preferentially nucleate material failure . 
Furthermore , interactions between these different defect types can significantly accelerate failure initiation and propagation . 
Lattice structures can add value to high-performance components manufactured by laser powder bed fusion due to their high specific strength and stiffness . 
A further use of lattice structures is in thermo-mechanical applications , where the high surface area of the lattice may aid heat transfer . 
However , little characterisation of lattices under thermal loading is currently available in the literature . 
In this study , a custom-built test rig was used to characterise the thermal conduction for three triply periodic minimal surface lattice types , namely : gyroid , diamond and Schwarz primitives , with unit cell size and volume fraction being varied.Results show that thermal conductivity is primarily a function of the material properties and volume fraction of the sample . 
However , some effects of the geometry , such as surface area to volume ratio , can be used to explain slight differences in the measured conductivity . 
The Schwarz primitive unit cell consistently gave the highest conductivity , with diamond and gyroid unit cells being marginally lower . 
Larger cell sizes typically gave higher conductivity than smaller cells , which can be attributed to greater intra-cell convective heat transfer and better interface coupling with the testing apparatus.The experimental results are used to derive equations that allow samples with a specified thermal conductivity to be designed , thus demonstrating how a component may be manufactured with a custom thermal profile by varying the volume fraction of the lattice . 
Sensing and closed-loop control are critical attributes of a robust 3D printing process , such as Directed Energy Deposition ( DED ) , in which it is necessary to manage geometry , material properties , and residual stress and distortion . 
The present research demonstrates multiple modes of closed-loop melt pool size control in laser-wire based DED , a form of large-scale metal additive manufacturing . 
First , real-time closed-loop melt pool size control through laser power modulation was demonstrated for intralayer control of bead geometry . 
Next , an interlayer trend in laser power during the printing of layered components was documented , which inspired the development of novel modes of control . 
A controller that modulates print speed and deposition rate on a per-layer basis was developed and demonstrated , enabling the control of either average melt pool size alone or average laser power in coordination with real-time melt pool size control . 
This work demonstrates that accumulated heat in components under construction can be exploited to maintain process stability as print speed and deposition rate are automatically increased under closed-loop control . 
This has major implications for overall production efficiency . 
Control modes are characterized in terms of their effect on local bead geometry , global part geometry , and interlayer effect on energy density , among other factors . 
Quality control in metal additive manufacturing prioritizes the development of advanced inspection schemes to characterize the defect evolution during processing and post-processing . 
This involves grand challenges in detecting internal defects and analyzing large and complex defect datasets in macroscopic samples . 
Here , we present an inspection pipeline that integrates ( i ) fast , micro X-ray computed tomography reconstruction , ( ii ) automated 3D morphology analysis , and ( iii ) machine learning-based big data analysis . 
X-ray computed tomography and automated computer vision result in a holistic defect morphology database for the inspected macroscopic volume , based on which machine learning analysis is employed to reveal quantitative insights into the global evolution of defect characteristics beyond qualitative human observations . 
We demonstrate this pipeline by examining the global-scale pore evolution in post-processing of binder jetting additive manufacturing , from the green state , to the sintered state , and to the hot isostatic pressed state of copper . 
The pipeline is shown to be effective at detecting and processing the information associated with a large number ( ∼105 ) of pores in macroscopic volumes . 
By quantifying the evolution of ( i ) the weight of pore morphology parameters and ( ii ) the pore number and volume fraction of each categorized group , new understandings are developed regarding the effects of sintering and hot isostatic pressing on pore decomposition , shrinkage , and smoothing during post-processing of binder jetting . 
Pore structures with isotropic stiffness fabricated via selective laser melting . 
The structures were based on topology optimization and additive manufacturing . 
The stiffness was experimentally verified . 
The stiffness and strength were higher than conventional porous metals . 
Recent additive manufacturing technologies can be used to fabricate porous metals with precise internal pore structures and effective performance . 
We use topology optimization to derive an optimal pore structure shape with high stiffness that is verified experimentally . 
The design maximizes the effective bulk modulus and isotropic stiffness , and the performance is compared with Hashin–Shtrikman ( HS ) bounds . 
The optimized structure is fabricated via selective laser melting of maraging steel , which is a high-strength , iron-nickel steel that can not easily be made porous with conventional methods . 
The optimal porous structure achieved 85 % of the performance of the HS upper bound in numerical simulations , and at least 90 % of them were realized in compressive testing . 
Finally , the performance is discussed relative to that of other metals . 
In metal additive manufacturing , microstructural inhomogeneities , like anisotropic mechanical strength and geometric limitations in directed energy deposition , electron beam melting , or selective laser sintering , have led to the exploration of alternative techniques in recent years . 
Among these techniques , fused filament fabrication is an attractive alternative due to its successes in producing dense parts , approaching traditional manufacturing specifications . 
Despite this success , many challenges remain to produce reliable parts with reproducible properties using FFF , particularly in the thermal treatment for part densification . 
% Ti-6Al-4V powder to create a printable filament . 
Printed Ti-6Al-4V parts using these filaments were sintered at temperatures ranging from 900 to 1340 °C and evaluated by x-ray diffraction , scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy . 
The sintered samples demonstrated a linear decrease in β-phase from 15 to 11 vol . 
% with increasing temperature , while residual stress and Young ’ s modulus increased . 
Additionally , the density of printed and sintered Ti-6Al-4V parts could be increased up to 91 % of the theoretical density of Ti-6Al-4V by increasing the sintering temperature up to 1340 °C . 
Samples that were sintered at 1340 °C showed a higher Young ’ s modulus compared to SLM samples , likely due to the increased α-phase in samples sintered at 1340 °C . 
The microstructures of additively manufactured ( AM ) metal components have been shown to be heterogeneous and spatially variable when compared to conventionally manufactured counterparts . 
Consequently , the mechanical properties of AM-metal parts are expected to vary locally within their volume . 
For AM structural components intended to operate in extreme environments , including high-strain-rate loading scenarios , there is a need to quantify variability of mechanical behavior within the same AM-build domain at quasi-static and dynamic strain-rates as well as the effect of heat treatment on the mechanical properties . 
The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of loading direction and direct-age hardening heat treatment on quasi-static and dynamic mechanical response within an Inconel 718 volume produced by laser powder bed fusion using manufacturer-recommended processing parameters . 
Uniaxial compression tests and a split-Hopkinson pressure bar ( SHPB ) were used to investigate the quasi-static and dynamic response , respectively , of as-built and heat-treated specimens extracted along the three principal processing directions . 
Electron backscatter diffraction measurements were made for representative specimens within the build domain to correlate microstructural features to observed location-specific mechanical deformation . 
Results from both quasi-static and dynamic loading show that the recommended processing parameters yield a homogeneous stress-strain response throughout the material volume in the as-built condition . 
Deformed specimen geometries showed a systematic and repeatable preferential deformation along the build direction , regardless of condition or loading strain rate when loading was applied in either of the two orthogonal processing directions . 
The deformation dependence is found to be related to the underlying , process-induced crystallographic texture and grain morphology . 
Two different honeycomb structures are manufactured with LENS system from Ti-6Al-4V alloy . 
Mechanical properties of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy are determined . 
Procedure for acquiring proper data for the elasto-visco-plastic constitutive model is presented . 
Energy-absorption properties of the honeycomb cellular structures are assessed during experimental and numerical testing . 
The paper presents a methodology investigation of honeycomb cellular structures deformation process in quasi-static compression tests . 
Two honeycomb topologies with different elementary cells were designed and manufactured from Ti-6Al-4 V alloy powder with the use of Laser Engineered Net Shaping ( LENS ) system and compressed using a universal strength machine . 
To simulate the deformation process with LS-Dyna software , the mechanical properties of the material were assessed and correlated . 
An elasto-visco-plastic material model ( Mat_Plasticity_With_Damage ) was used for predicting the material behavior . 
The results of experimental tests and numerical simulations were compared . 
A reasonable agreement between deformation , failure and force histories was obtained . 
Additionally , both the topologies were compared for their energy absorption capabilities . 
The validated numerical modelling with the adopted constitutive model will be used in the further studies to analyze different cellular structures topologies subjected to dynamic loading . 
A novel technique was developed to control the microstructure evolution in Alloy 718 processed using Electron Beam Melting ( EBM ) . 
In situ solution treatment and aging of Alloy 718 was performed by heating the top surface of the build after build completion scanning an electron beam to act as a planar heat source during the cool down process . 
Results demonstrate that the measured hardness ( 478 ± 7 HV ) of the material processed using in situ heat treatment similar to that of peak-aged Inconel 718 . 
Large solidification grains and cracks formed , which are identified as the likely mechanism leading to failure of tensile tests of the in situ heat treatment material under loading . 
Despite poor tensile performance , the technique proposed was shown to successively age Alloy 718 ( increase precipitate size and hardness ) without removing the sample from the process chamber , which can reduce the number of process steps in producing a part . 
Tighter controls on processing temperature during layer melting to lower process temperature and selective heating during in situ heat treatment to reduce over-sintering are proposed as methods for improving the process . 
Lattice structures with isotropic stiffness fabricated via electron beam melting . 
The structures were based on topology optimization and additive manufacturing . 
The designed isotropic stiffness was experimentally verified . 
The strength was also isotropic as the same with stiffness . 
Electron-beam melting ( EBM ) exhibits advantages over other metal-additive manufacturing techniques owing to its low residual stress , rapid fabrication speed , and high energy efficiency . 
However , in EBM , metal powder is preheated and sintered to stabilize the temperature gradient and powder position during melting with a high-power electron beam . 
When making a lattice structure by EBM , a certain size of the powder-removing hole is required to remove the sintered remaining metal powder from the lattice . 
However , a large powder-removing hole can reduce the lattice mechanical performance . 
We conducted topology optimization to derive an optimal lattice structure shape with high isotropic stiffness assuming fabrication by EBM and minimizing the performance reduction owing to fixed large powder-removing holes . 
The optimized structure was fabricated via the EBM of a Ti–6Al–4V alloy . 
The optimal lattice structure achieved 83 % of the performance of the Hashin–Shtrikman upper bound in numerical simulations , but an approximate 20 % stiffness reduction was observed in the experiments . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) is a commonly used powder bed fusion metal additive manufacturing ( AM ) process . 
Although SLM is preferred due to its near-net-shape part commitment , the deposition rate of this process is slower compared with alternative metal processes . 
A higher deposition rate of SLM can be obtained by increasing the laser scanning velocity and laser power ; however , this results in decreased part quality due to the SLM process ’ s physical limits . 
This study presents the conditions for a higher deposition rate for various process parameters with defocused beams to eliminate the void defects due to keyholing formed in the melt pool . 
Single bead experiments were conducted , and the thresholds of the process parameters resulting in voids were identified . 
A melt pool depth-to-width ratio of 0.85 was found to be a critical value for preventing voids in the process . 
The melt pool aspect ratio was related with the process parameters by using the normalized enthalpy and the volumetric energy density . 
The threshold values of the normalized enthalpy due to voids were independent from the beam diameters . 
Moreover , unstable single bead track thresholds were plotted as a function of the beam diameters . 
In addition to the experiments , a finite element analysis model was built with calibrated absorptivity and heat source parameters to predict the melt pool geometries for a wide range of process parameters ( power = 100–370 W , velocity = 200–2000 mm/s , and beam diameter = 100–260 μm ) . 
A new laser metal desposition process based on an inside-laser coaxial powder feeding system was successfully applied to manufacture reduced activation steel , which is featured with fine microstructure and excellent mechanical properties . 
In addition , infrared thermal imaging experiments and Abaqus numerical simulation were conducted to characterize the complex thermal history during the laser metal deposition process . 
The microstructure and mechanical properties of reduced activation steel were systematically investigated in the as-fabricated and heat-treated samples . 
The results indicat that the peak temperature increased and the cooling rate decreased in the melt pool when the additional layers were deposited as a result of a cumulative effect of heat in the fabricated thin wall samples . 
The reduced cooling rate directly contributed to the decreased heterogeneous nucleation rate and the coarsening of austenite grains in the top domain . 
The differences in terms of microstructure and hardness of the as-fabricated samples along the building direction were also in a good agreement with the evolution of temperature field . 
The thermal cycling experimental and cyclic heat treatment results confirmed that in-situ thermal cycles were unable to trigger recrystallization because the stored strain energy was insufficient to induce nucleation of new austenite grains during laser directed energy deposition . 
Additive manufacture of sand molds via binder jetting enables the casting of complex metal geometries . 
Various material systems have been created for 3D printing of sand molds ; however , a formal study of the materials ’ effects on cast products has not yet been conducted . 
In this paper the authors investigate potential differences in material properties ( microstructure , porosity , mechanical strength ) of A356 – T6 castings resulting from two different commercially available 3D printing media . 
In addition , the material properties of cast products from traditional “ no-bake ” silica sand is used as a basis for comparison of castings produced by the 3D printed molds . 
It was determined that resultant castings yielded statistically equivalent results in four of the seven tests performed : dendrite arm spacing , porosity , surface roughness , and tensile strength and differed in sand tensile strength , hardness , and density . 
As additive manufacturing ( AM ) advances rapidly towards new materials and applications , it is vital to understand the performance limits of AM technologies and to overcome these limits via improved machine design and process integration . 
Extrusion-based AM ( i.e. 
, fused filament fabrication , FFF ) is compatible with a wide variety of thermoplastic polymer and composite materials , and can be deployed across a wide range of length scales . 
However , the build rate of both desktop and professional FFF systems is comparable ( ∼10 ’ s of cm3/h at ∼0.2 mm layer thickness ) , suggesting that fundamental aspects of the machine design and process physics limit system performance . 
We determine the rate limits to FFF by analysis of machine modules : the filament extrusion mechanism , the heater and nozzle , and the motion system . 
We determine , by direct measurements and numerical analysis , that FFF build rate is influenced by the coincident module-level limits to traction force exerted on the filament , conduction heat transfer to the filament core , and gantry velocity for positioning the printhead . 
Our findings are validated by direct measurements of build rate versus part complexity using desktop FFF systems . 
Last , we study the scaling of the rate limits using finite element simulations of thermoplastic flow through the extruder . 
We map the scaling of extrusion force , polymer exit temperature , and average printhead velocity onto a unifying trade-space of build rate versus resolution . 
This approach validates the build rate performance of current FFF systems , and suggests that significant enhancements in FFF build rate with targeted quality specifications are possible via mutual improvements to the extrusion and heating mechanism along with high-speed motion systems . 
The ability to design complex copper ( Cu ) parts into the most efficient thermal structures is an old dream , but difficult to realize with conventional manufacturing techniques . 
The recent development of laser 3D printing techniques makes it possible to fully explore intricate designs and maximize the thermal performance of Cu-based thermal management components but present significant challenges due to its high optical reflectivity . 
In this study , we demonstrated the laser 3D printing of pure Cu with a moderate laser power ( 400 W ) . 
Dense Cu parts ( 95 % ) with smooth surface finishing ( Ra ∼18 μm ) were obtained at a scan speed of 400 mm/s , a hatch distance of 0.12 mm , and a layer thickness of 0.03 mm . 
The hardness , electrical , and thermal conductivity of the printed Cu parts are 108 MPa , 5.71 × 107 S/m , and 368 W/m·K , respectively which are close to those of bulk Cu . 
Additionally , complex heat sink structures were printed with large surface areas ( 600 mm2/g ) , and their cooling performances were compared to a commercial heat sink with a smaller surface area ( 286 mm2/g ) on an electronic chip . 
The complex heat sinks printed cools the electronic chip 45 % more efficiently than the commercial one . 
The introduction of selective laser melting to additively manufacturing Cu heat sinks offers the promise to enhance the performance beyond the scope of exciting thermal management components . 
Control of microstructure in a TiAl alloy was conducted by electron beam melting ( 82/85 ) . 
An unique layered microstructure was created by the proposed EBM process ( 74/85 ) . 
The room temperature ductility was greater than 2 % under an appropriate condition ( 83/85 ) . 
As-EBM specimens exhibited high yield strength and good ductility at 800 °C ( 76/85 ) . 
This paper clarified a novel strategy to improve the tensile properties of the Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb alloys fabricated by electron beam melting ( EBM ) , via the finding of the development of unique layered microstructure composed of duplex-like fine grains layers and coarser γ grains layers . 
It was clarified that the mechanical properties of the alloy fabricated by EBM can be controlled by varying an angle θ between EBM-building directions and stress loading direction . 
At room temperature , the yield strength exhibits high values more than 550 MPa at all the loading orientations investigated ( θ = 0 , 45 and 90° ) . 
The anisotropy of the yield strength decreased with increasing temperature . 
All the examined alloys exhibited a brittle-ductile transition temperature of approximately 750 °C and the yield strength and tensile elongation at 800 °C were over 350 MPa and 40 % , respectively.By the detailed observation of the microstructure , the formation mechanism of the unique layered microstructure was found to be closely related to the repeated local heat treatment effect during the EBM process , and thus its control is further possible by the tuning-up of the process parameters . 
The results demonstrate that the EBM process enables not only the fabrication of TiAl products with complex shape but also the control of the tensile properties associated with the peculiar microstructure formed during the process . 
Ti-1Al-8V-5Fe ( Ti-185 ) and other Fe containing β -Ti alloys are attractive because of their high strength and low cost . 
These alloys , however , can not be produced through ingot casting due to strong Fe segregation and the formation of β flecks . 
Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) was successfully used to produce Ti-185 components starting from elemental Ti and Fe powders , and an Al-V master alloy powder with irregular shape . 
Microstructure analysis of the as-built components demonstrated that SLM can be used to produce a very fine grain microstructure with nano-scale precipitates and non-detrimental Fe segregation . 
The findings are interpreted in terms of the rapid solidification conditions during SLM . 
Compression test results reveal that ultra-high strength and reasonable ductility can be achieved in the as-built as well as heat treated samples . 
Residual distortion is a major technical challenge for laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) additive manufacturing ( AM ) , since excessive distortion can cause build failure , cracks and loss in structural integrity . 
However , residual distortion can hardly be avoided due to the rapid heating and cooling inherent in this AM process . 
Thus , fast and accurate distortion prediction is an effective way to ensure manufacturability and build quality . 
This paper proposes a multiscale process modeling framework for efficiently and accurately simulating residual distortion and stress at the part-scale for the direct metal laser sintering ( DMLS ) process . 
In this framework , inherent strains are extracted from detailed process simulation of micro-scale model based on the recently proposed modified inherent strain model . 
The micro-scale detailed process simulation employs the actual parameters of the DMLS process such as laser power , velocity , and scanning path . 
Uniform but anisotropic strains are then applied to the part in a layer-by-layer fashion in a quasi-static equilibrium finite element analysis , in order to predict residual distortion/stress for the entire AM build . 
Effectiveness of this proposed framework is demonstrated by simulating a double cantilever beam and a canonical part with varying wall thicknesses and comparing with experimental measurements which show very good agreement . 
The metallurgy of selected metal and alloy components fabricated by additive metallurgy using electron beam melting ( EBM ) is presented for a range of examples including Ti-6Al-4V , Co-Cr-Mo super alloy , Ni-base super alloy systems ( Inconel 625 , 718 and Rene 142 ) , Nb and Fe . 
Precursor and pre-alloyed powders are preheated and selectively melted using a range of EBM process parameters including beam scan strategies , beam current variations , and cooling rate features . 
Microstructures and residual mechanical properties are discussed for selected systems in contrast to more conventional wrought and cast products . 
Novel features of EBM fabrication include columnar microstructural architectures which result by layer-by-layer melt-solidification phenomena . 
Combining electrical and magnetic materials in the same part has been a challenge in 3D printing due to difficulties co-printing complex materials in many additive manufacturing processes . 
Past 3D printed inductors and other similar magnetic devices have therefore either lacked the magnetic materials necessary for improved performance , or required sintering at high temperatures for extended periods , beyond the capability of most 3D printable polymers . 
In this work , we demonstrate a room temperature process for incorporating conductive and magnetic materials into the same 3D printed device . 
A multi-stage fabrication process based on 3D printing followed by fill with magnetic and conductive fluids is proposed . 
Multi-layer microfluidic channels for magnetic passives are first printed in a stereolithography process . 
The microfluidic systems are then filled with room temperature liquid metal , a gallium alloy liquid at room temperature , and ferrofluid to create inductors , transformers and wireless power coils . 
3D finite element modeling of LSFF process is presented based on a moving mesh approach . 
Temporal behaviors of stress fields and temperature distributions are explored for different deposited layers . 
Effects of preheating and addition of nano particles are thoroughly investigated . 
Scanning velocity of the laser plays a key role on the clad shape . 
Gas turbine blades , turbine shafts and centrifugal compressor impellers are often damaged by erosion and/or corrosion . 
By laser cladding technique , a coating layer can be deposited on the base material in order to rebuild , repair and improve anti-erosion or anti-corrosion properties of the sensitive machine parts . 
In this paper , a three-dimensional finite element modeling of the laser solid freeform fabrication ( LSFF ) process for nickel alloy 625 powder mixed with nano-CeO2 on AISI 4140 steel is extensively studied . 
Using Comsol Multiphysics software and the finite element method ( FEM ) , the heat transfer equation , moving mesh equation and stress tensor are numerically solved . 
Clad shape , temperature distribution and stress fields are obtained . 
The effects of preheating as well as addition of nano-CeO2 are investigated . 
Dependence of the clad height on the scanning velocity of the laser is also studied . 
This paper demonstrates the ability to 3D print a fluoropolymer based energetic material which could be used as part of a multifunctional reactive structure . 
The work presented lays the technical foundation for the 3D printing of reactive materials using fusion based material extrusion . 
A reactive filament comprising of a polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ) binder with 20 % mass loading of aluminum ( Al ) was prepared using a commercial filament extruder and printed using a Makerbot Replicator 2X . 
Printing performance of the energetic samples was compared with standard 3D printing materials , with metrics including the bead-to-bead adhesion and surface quality of the printed samples . 
The reactivity and burning rates of the filaments and the printed samples were comparable . 
Differential scanning calorimetry and thermal gravimetric analysis showed that the onset temperature for the reactions was above 350 °C , which is well above the operation temperature of both the filament extruder and the fused deposition printer . 
A lattice Boltzmann ( LB ) method to simulate melt pool dynamics and a cellular automaton ( CA ) to simulate the solidification process are coupled to predict the microstructure evolution during selective electron beam melting ( SEBM ) . 
The resulting CALB model takes into account powder related stochastic effects , energy absorption and evaporation , melt pool dynamics and solidification microstructure evolution . 
Several physical phenomena are observed during grain solidification , e.g. 
, initial grain selection starting at the base plate , grain boundary perturbation , grain nucleation due to unmolten powder particles in the bulk , grain penetration from the surface of the part or grain alignment dependent on the beam scanning strategy . 
The effect of process parameters on the final grain structure and texture evolution is presented . 
Manufacturing of ceramic components with a geometrically complex 3D architecture and highly detailed features for use in a variety of practical applications is still a challenge . 
In our investigation , we adopted a synergistic strategy for fabricating SiOC ceramics with intricate 3D morphologies by additive manufacturing and origami technique or assemblage , taking advantage of the high printability and flexibility of a commercially available silicone elastomer . 
Secondary shaping using origami of different 2D layers with varied design allowed the manufacturing of spiral , flower-like and polyhedron architectures , which are difficult to fabricate without adding supports or by any conventional ceramic fabrication processes . 
Produced samples showed no cracks or pores and fully retained the given shape after pyrolysis . 
Origami-assisted 3D printing enables easy fabrication of complex SiOC ceramic structures without requiring any supports . 
The potential of adding fillers into the silicone material used in this work could expand the applicability of the manufactured structures introducing additional functional properties.Download : Download high-res image ( 212 The aim of this paper is to investigate the evolution of a matrix-filler interface during the processing of novel composites formed by a matrix of polylactic acid ( PLA ) and Mg particles , when they are manufactured by Materials Extrusion . 
The particles addition to the PLA was carried out through the preparation of a Magnesium stable suspension in the polymer solution . 
To improve the Mg dispersion , the surfaces of the particles were previously modified by the adsorption of dispersants , namely Polyethylenimine ( PEI ) and Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ( CTAB ) in aqueous suspension . 
The physical and mechanical characterization of PLA/Mg composites show that the Mg surface modification is the key to its successful dispersion due to the formation of ionic interactions between the dispersants and the matrix . 
This is favoured by the seeding effect of the PEI-modified Mg particles over the PLA re-precipitation during the composite shaping . 
Moreover , a PEI-PLA covalent bond appeared in the printed scaffolds as a consequence of the temperature applied ( 165 °C ) during extrusion and printing . 
Consequently , the matrix-filler strengthened interface improved the extrusion process and permits the printing of 3D customized pieces . 
At the same time , particle agglomeration and the nozzle blocking is prevented . 
To reveal the mechanism of oxidation and the effect of inclusion characteristics on the mechanical properties of additively-manufactured metal matrix , two groups of AISI 316 L stainless steel samples were fabricated under different flow rates of shielding gas ( Ar ) at two intensities of laser beam . 
As flow rates of shielding gas increased from 5 L/min to 25 L/min , the oxygen content in the melt pool decreased from 775 ppm to 375 ppm at low intensity of laser beam ( 73 W/m2 ) , and from 677 ppm to 1470 ppm at high intensity of laser beam ( 725 W/m2 ) . 
Variation in oxygen content affected melt pool shape , solidification texture , and the mechanical properties of the material . 
In each intensity of laser beam group , optimal flow rates of shielding gas condition for tensile property existed . 
As inclusion number density increased from 8866/mm2 to 45909/mm2 , yield stress increased to 26 % . 
A rapid drop in ductility occurred at flow rate 5 L/min , because independently-nucleated spinel accelerated inclusion coalescence in the melt pool . 
Directed energy deposition ( DED ) is a metal additive manufacturing process , where dimensional accuracy and repeatability are traditionally challenging to achieve . 
Strategies for computationally inexpensive process modelling and fast-response process controls of the laser deposition process are necessary to keep the geometric features close to the required dimensional tolerances . 
The deposition geometry depends highly on the complex local laser-material interaction and global thermal history of the substrate . 
In order to control the deposition geometry , an accurate and computationally inexpensive discretized state space thermal history model coupled with an analytical deposition geometry model is developed in this work . 
The model accounts for the local laser-material interaction using the mass and energy equilibrium equations coupled in a lumped parameter solution , as well as the global thermal history of the product using a state space thermomechanical discretization . 
In literature , studies have only focused on 1D toolpaths with constant process parameters such as speed , powder feedrate , and laser power . 
As it is possible to achieve highly complex geometric shapes with additive manufacturing , it is important to have models compatible with 2D/3D complex toolpaths . 
In this paper , an analytical thermomechanical model and a coupled deposition geometry model for DED process are presented and experimentally validated . 
As such , the thermal history of the deposited part is predicted throughout the process and the geometric features are predicted for 2D toolpaths . 
Despite the ongoing success of metal additive manufacturing and especially the selective laser melting ( SLM ) technology , process-related defects , distortions and residual stresses impede its usability for fracture-critical applications . 
In this paper , results of in situ X-ray diffraction experiments are presented that offer insights into the strain and stress formation during the manufacturing of multi-layer thin walls made from Inconel 625 . 
Using different measuring modes and laser scanning parameters , several experimental observations are discussed to validate and extend theoretical models and simulations from the literature . 
As a sample is built-up layer by layer , the stress state changes continuously up until the last exposure . 
The localized energy input leads to a complex stress field around the heat source that involves alternating tensile and compressive stresses . 
The correlation of temperature and yield strength results in a stress maximum at a certain distance to the top layer . 
The present study demonstrates the potential of high-energy synchrotron radiation diffraction for in situ SLM research . 
Fabry-Pérot ultrasonic metamaterials have been additively manufactured using laser powder bed fusion to contain subwavelength holes with a high aspect-ratio of width to depth . 
Such metamaterials require the acoustic impedance mismatch between the structure and the immersion medium to be large . 
It is shown for the first time that metallic structures fulfil this criterion for applications in water over the 200 – 800 kHz frequency range . 
It is also demonstrated that laser powder bed fusion is a flexible fabrication method for the ceration of structures with different thicknesses , hole geometry and tapered openings , allowing the acoustic properties to be modified . 
It was confirmed via both finite element simulation and practical measurements that these structures supported Fabry-Pérot resonances , needed for metamaterial operation , at ultrasonic frequencies in water . 
Selective electron beam melting ( SEBM ) is shown to be a viable production route for titanium aluminides components . 
Fully dense and crack free parts can be produced . 
In the present paper a titanium aluminide alloy Ti-45Al-4Nb-C was investigated and the complete processing chain was developed , i.e . 
starting from the determination of the processing window , the evaluation of corresponding material properties for cube like specimens and finally the production of turbocharger wheels . 
The material properties were optimized by adjusting scanning strategy as well as heat treatment with particular consideration of the application to turbocharger wheels . 
The issue of dimensional accuracy and the feasibility of joining will be discussed and a proof test is performed . 
Cobalt-chromium-molybdenum ( CoCrMo ) alloys are widely used in load-bearing implants ; specifically , in hip , knee , and spinal applications due to their excellent wear resistance . 
However , due to in vivo corrosion and mechanically assisted corrosion , metal ion release occurs and accounts for poor biocompatibility . 
Therefore , a significant interest to improve upon CoCrMo alloy exists . 
In the present work we hypothesize that calcium phosphate ( CaP ) will behave as a solid lubricant in CoCrMo alloy under tribological testing , thereby minimizing wear and metal ion release concerns associated with CoCrMo alloy . 
CoCrMo-CaP composite coatings were processed using laser engineered net shaping ( LENS™ ) system . 
After LENS™ processing , CoCrMo alloy was subjected to laser surface melting ( LSM ) using the same LENS™ set-up . 
Samples were investigated for microstructural features , phase identification , and biocompatibility . 
It was found that LSM treated CoCrMo improved wear resistance by 5 times . 
Our results show that careful surface modification treatments can simultaneously improve wear resistance and in vivo biocompatibility of CoCrMo alloy , which can correlate to a reduction of metal ion release in vivo . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) has several possible advantages over traditional manufacturing including increased design freedom , reduced material usage , and shorter lead-times . 
A noteworthy capability of AM is the ability to monitor the process during material deposition and interrupt the process during fabrication if necessary . 
Recently , such monitoring , feedback , and control have been made possible by implementing in situ infrared ( IR ) thermography in powder bed fusion AM technologies . 
The purpose of the current research was to investigate the acquisition of absolute surface temperatures using in situ IR imaging of the melted or solid surfaces layer-by-layer during fabrication within an electron beam melting ( EBM ) system . 
The thermal camera was synchronized with the system 's signal voltages of three synchronized events ( pre-heating , melting , and raking ) to automatically capture images . 
To acquire absolute temperature values from the IR images , a calibration procedure was established to determine the solid material 's emissivity and reflected temperature or mean radiant temperature of the build chamber , which are necessary input parameters for the IR camera . 
A blackbody radiator was fabricated via EBM and was used as a tool to determine the emissivity of Ti–6Al–4V ( determined to be 0.26 in the temperature range of the current study ) . 
heat shielding ) that were used in calculating the mean radiant temperature of the manufacturing environment ( ∼342 °C ) . 
Experimental validation of the model was performed using a thermocouple embedded during fabrication that showed a 3.77 % difference in temperature . 
A temperature difference of ∼366 °C ( 1038 °C vs. 672 °C ) was observed when comparing uncorrected IR temperature data with corrected temperature data . 
Upon validation of the IR parameters for a melted area , experimentation was conducted to also determine powder emissivity ( found to be 0.50 ) . 
The thermal model presented here can be modified and implemented in other AM technologies for consideration of radiation energy to acquire absolute temperatures of layered surfaces , leading to improved thermal monitoring and control of the fabrication process . 
In-situ welding during powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process was proposed . 
Highly dense part without degrading of mechanical properties was fabricated by EBM . 
The applications of EBM technology was expanded using the in-situ welding concept . 
As one of the powder-bed-fusion additive manufacturing processes , electron beam melting ( EBM ) is able to produce metal parts directly . 
Many small volume components with high quality have been fabricated using the EBM technology . 
However , there are only few reports on the EBM fabrication of medium-sized components . 
This , in turn , drastically degrades the mechanical properties of the EBM printed parts . 
Here , we firstly report an in-situ welding process to overcome the lack of energy issue caused by the long scan length during EBM process . 
After the investigation of the corresponding microstructure , microhardness and tensile properties , it is revealed that the in-situ welding zone is fully joined and the mechanical properties of the in-situ welded part are comparable to that of the wrought counterpart . 
This implies that medium-sized components can be successfully fabricated using the EBM , with no compromise on the mechanical properties . 
From pottery to clay tablets and building materials , clay easily qualifies as one of the most versatile materials in the history of human civilization . 
Clay owes this versatility to the distinct properties it exhibits before and after firing . 
Soft , unfired clay can morph into complex shapes , while fired clay offers a fixed shape and higher stiffness . 
Despite several potential applications , thus far , no designer materials with similar properties have been demonstrated . 
Here , we introduce the concept of metallic clay : a designer material that mimics the two-state behavior of clay . 
Metallic clay could initially morph into arbitrarily complex shapes owing to numerous degrees-of-freedom that its various kinematic ( moving ) and compliant ( deformable ) joints afford . 
The fabrication of metallic clay requires novel designs of joints and locking mechanisms that are compatible with metal 3D printing ( additive manufacturing ) techniques such that metallic clay can be fabricated through a single-step , non-assembly , and self-supporting 3D printing process . 
We designed with 3D printing 17 prototypes using selective laser melting from a medical grade high strength titanium alloy ( Ti-6Al-4V ) to demonstrate the various aspects of metallic clay . 
Biomass-derived polymers have been rapidly developed for alleviating excessive fossil-fuel-based plastic consumption , as green manufacturing is required due to many environmental issues . 
Here , using a recently developed biopolymer , bio-based polycarbonate ( bio PC ) , we demonstrated the processability of filament-feedstock extrusion and extrusion-type 3D printing . 
Under a set of optimal process conditions , the as-printed bio PC products showed superior tensile strength compared to other commercial polymers . 
We also confirmed the environmentally friendly characteristics of the thermoplastic processes of bio PC by measuring hazardous emissions during 3D printing . 
Finally , considering sterilization of the as-printed consumer products , we tested the resistive properties of bio PC parts against heat and UV . 
Collectively , the good 3D printability , low gas and particle emission , and decent durability of the bio PC material indicate great potential applications for indoor home manufacturing of various consumer products . 
Process−property relationships in additive manufacturing ( AM ) play critical roles in process control and rapid certification . 
In laser-based directed energy deposition , powder mass flow into the melt pool influences the cooling behavior and properties of a built part . 
This study develops predictive computational models that provide the microhardness of AM components processed with miscible dissimilar alloys , and then investigates the influence of varying process parameters on properties in experiments and modeling . 
Experimentally-determined clad dilution and microhardness results of Ni-based superalloy Inconel 718 clads deposited onto 1045 carbon steel substrates are compared to the values from a computational thermo-fluid dynamics ( CtFD ) model . 
The numerical model considers the fluidic mechanisms of molten metal during powder deposition and the resulting transient melt pool geometry changes . 
The model also handles the change in thermo-physical properties caused by the composition mixture between the powder and substrate materials in the melt pool . 
Based on the computed temperature and velocity distributions in the melt pool , cooling rate , dilution of the melt pool and microhardenss are evaluated . 
The capability to predict thermal histories in such models is calibrated and validated with experimental thermal imaging and microstructures of additive manufactured clads . 
In addition , the roles of cooling rate and alloy composition on the microhardness are examined . 
The results show that variation in microhardness is dominated by composition mixture between the powder and substrate materials , rather than cooling behavior or dendrite arm spacing at liquid-solid interface in laser deposited Inconel 718 on AISI 1045 carbon steel . 
A new one-way coupled thermal-mechanical finite element based model of direct metal laser sintering ( DMLS ) is developed to simulate the process , and predict distortion and cracking failure location in the fabricated components . 
The model takes into account the layer-by-layer additive manufacturing features , solidification and melting phenomena . 
The model is first validated using experimental data , then model is applied to a DMLS fabricated component . 
The study shows how the stress distribution at the support-solid interface is critical to contributing to cracking and distortion . 
During the DMLS process , thermal stress at the support-solid interface reaches its maximum during the printing process , particularly when the first solid layer is built above the support layer . 
This result suggests that cracking at the interface may occur during the printing process , which is consistent with experimental observation . 
Using a design parametric study , a thick and low-density porous layer is found to reduce residual stress and distortion in the built component . 
The developed finite element model can be used to future design and optimize DMLS process . 
There is growing interest in Laser Powder Bed Fusion ( L-PBF ) or Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) manufacturing of high conductivity metals such as copper and refractory metals . 
SLM manufacturing of high thermal conductivity metals is particularly difficult . 
In case of refractory metals , the difficulty is amplified because of their high melting point and brittle behaviour . 
Rapid process development strategies are essential to identify suitable process parameters for achieving minimum porosities in these alloys , yet current strategies suffer from several limitations . 
We propose a simple approach for rapid process development using normalized process maps . 
Using plots of normalized energy density vs. normalized hatch spacing , we identify a wide processability window . 
This is further refined using analytical heat transfer models to predict melt pool size . 
Final optimization of the parameters is achieved by experiments based on statistical Design of Experiments concepts . 
In this article we demonstrate the use of our proposed approach for development of process parameters ( hatch spacing , layer thickness , exposure time and point distance ) for SLM manufacturing of molybdenum and aluminium . 
Relative densities of 97.4 % and 99.7 % are achieved using 200 W pulsed laser and 400 W continuous laser respectively , for molybdenum and aluminium , demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for SLM processing of high conductivity materials . 
Inconel 718 , a widely used nickel based super alloy , is of special interest to the aerospace and automotive fields for its highly desirable and consistent material properties over a large range of temperatures . 
The objective of this research is to understand the effect of process parameters of a Direct Metal Laser Sintering ( DMLS ) machine , concerning mainly beam power between 40 W and 300 W and scan line speed between 200 mm/s and 2500 mm/s on scan line quality , line geometry and dimensions , and melt pool geometry in laser melted Inconel 718 line scans . 
Higher power runs resulted in voids forming in the bottom of the melt pool and were consistent with either electron beam welding or melting processes operating at higher temperatures . 
Laser energy density ( LED ) , a method of correlating the effects of scan speed and beam power into one characteristic process parameter , was also investigated . 
This ratio of beam power to scan speed follows a second order polynomial trend line for melt pool width and a logarithmic trend for average line width . 
LED values for melt pool depth are separated to show two trend lines as two mechanisms operate at low values below 0.25 J/mm and high values above 0.25 J/mm . 
Process optimization has always been a crucial step for effective usage of metal additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes : it consists in establishing quantitative relations between final part 's characteristics and process parameters to find their optimal combination and obtain a fully functional mechanical component . 
Experimental investigation techniques are usually employed for this purpose but they can be extremely expensive and time-consuming , especially when the output of the process depends on a large number of parameters , like for AM . 
Numerical simulation could represent an alternative solution : by reproducing the real process characteristics , a simulation could provide useful insights , allowing to evaluate the performance of the process for different parameter combinations without relying exclusively on expensive experimental campaigns.In this work , a finite element AM simulation based on the inherent strain ( IS ) method was developed and the prediction performance in terms of part 's residual deformation was evaluated by comparing the numerical results with the measurements carried out on an experimental campaign . 
A new model calibration approach for prediction improvement was also implemented and it allowed to discover an unexpected behaviour of the model that strongly affects the validity of this method for AM simulation . 
The role of volumetric energy density on the microstructural evolution , texture and mechanical properties of 304L stainless steel parts additively manufactured via selective laser melting process is investigated . 
304L is chosen because it is a potential candidate to be used as a matrix in a metal matrix composite with nanoparticles dispersion for energy and high temperature applications . 
The highest relative density of 99 % ±0.5 was achieved using a volumetric energy density of 1400 J/mm3 . 
Both XRD analysis and Scheil simulation revealed the presence of a small trace of the delta ferrite phase , due to rapid solidification within the austenitic matrix of 304L . 
A fine cellular substructure ranged between 0.4–1.8 μm , was detected across different energy density values . 
At the highest energy density value , a strong texture in the direction of [ 100 ] was identified . 
At lower energy density values , multicomponent texture was found due to high nucleation rate and the existing defects . 
Yield strength , ultimate tensile strength , and microhardness of samples with a relative density of 99 % were measured to be 540 ± 15 MPa , 660 ± 20 MPa and 254 ± 7 HV , respectively and higher than mechanical properties of conventionally manufactured 304L stainless steel . 
Heat treatment of the laser melted 304L at 1200 °C for 2 h , resulted in the nucleation of recrystallized equiaxed grains followed by a decrease in microhardness value from 233 ± 3 HV to 208 ± 8 HV due to disappearance of cellular substructure . 
In this work the process of Acoustoplastic Metal Direct-write ( AMD ) is introduced for the first time . 
Millimeter-scale 3D aluminum articles were printed to demonstrate the process feasibility . 
Evidence of process-induced inter-layer and intra-layer mass transport resulting in metallurgical bonding across voxels was obtained . 
During voxel formation , a process temperature rise of 5 ° Celsius from a process ambient temperature of 25 ° Celsius was recorded . 
In addition , acoustic energy-induced microstructural changes during process were observed in the material . 
The work presented here not only demonstrates the feasibility of a new non-melt fusion room temperature metal 3D printing approach—capable of producing metals with more than 99 percent density—but also presents both observational study and an initial theoretical basis upon which a new athermal microstructural transformation process may be understood Selective laser melting and other additive manufacturing ( AM ) techniques have recently attracted substantial interest of both researchers and the processing industry . 
In the selective laser melting ( SLM ) process , the components are produced layer-wise using a laser beam . 
SLM is a powder bed based AM process and is characterized by the complete melting of the utilized powder material . 
Employing SLM , complex three-dimensional parts and light weight structures can be produced directly from 3D CAD data . 
However , although SLM is a very promising technology , there are still challenges to solve . 
Under cyclic loading , pores can act as stress raisers and lead to premature crack initiations , which reduce the fatigue strength of the material . 
Hot isostatic pressing ( HIP ) offers the possibility to reduce the porosity . 
HIP combines high pressure and high temperature to produce materials with superior properties . 
The influence of the HIP process parameters on the density and microstructure of IN718 SLM components is investigated by means of micro X-ray computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy . 
The results of the experiments show that the majority of pores can be densified by means of HIP . 
On the other hand , some pores can not be densified . 
The reason for this is seen in entrapped argon gas from the SLM process . 
Laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) additive manufacturing technology is sensitive to variations in powder particle morphology and size distribution . 
However , the absence of a clear link between the powder characteristics and the LPBF performances complicates the development , selection and quality control of LPBF powder feedstock . 
In this work , three Ti-6Al-4 V powder lots produced by two different techniques , namely , plasma atomization and gas atomization , were selected and characterized . 
Following the micro-computed tomography analysis of the powder particles ’ morphology , size and density , the flowability of these powder lots was concurrently evaluated using Hall and Gustavsson flowmeters and an FT4 powder rheometer . 
Next , the same three powder lots were used to 3D-print and post-process a series of testing specimens with different layer thicknesses and build orientations , in order to establish a correlation between the powder characteristics and the geometric and mechanical properties of a final product . 
This study demonstrates that the use of highly spherical powders with a limited amount of fine particles promotes their flowability and yields LPBF components with improved mechanical and geometric characteristics . 
Although the melt pool convection currents influence the dilution , porosity and distribution of potentially included hard phase particles such as carbide or other ceramic particles , which are added to increase the wear resistance of the deposited material , there is only limited knowledge of melt pool dynamics within blown powder additive manufacturing processes . 
In the pursuit of a deeper understanding , a high-speed camera has been used to observe melt pool dynamics during laser cladding at a frame rate of up to 67 ’ 000 frames per second , allowing for the particles that swim on the surface to be traced automatically . 
The resulting videos allow for the melt pool surface behavior to be investigated using a specifically developed automated high-speed camera image evaluation technique . 
This method has been tested for reliability and applied to investigate the process parameter influence on melt pool dynamics . 
The results show , that there is no pronounced laminar flow on the melt pool surface , instead a remarkable randomness to the direction of particle flow can be observed . 
That being said , it is still possible to identify certain flow tendencies that can be explained by surface tension phenomena like the Marangoni effect and which depend on the process parameters . 
Laser Metal Deposition is a near-net-shape processing technology , which allows remarkable freedom in multi-material processing . 
It has been shown that multi-material processing of the two alloys via discrete as well as via gradual material transition is possible without any cracks for manufacturing small cubes . 
Cross-sections of manufactured parts and tracks showed that a preheating temperature of at least 400 °C is necessary to process crack free samples . 
EDX-analyses indicated that if a discrete material transition is required in multi-material processing , the material transition should be implemented in the vertical build-up direction because the mixing zone in this direction is significantly smaller than the mixing zone in the horizontal direction . 
Due to the stronger mixing effects in the horizontal direction , a gradual material transition by a linear progression should be implemented in this direction rather than in the vertical direction . 
The mixing effects are mainly caused by melt flow , while diffusion effects can be neglected . 
Processing of the low workability Fe-Co-1.5V ( Hiperco® equivalent ) alloy is demonstrated using the Laser Engineered Net Shaping ( LENS ) metals additive manufacturing technique . 
As an innovative and highly localized solidification process , LENS is shown to overcome workability issues that arise during conventional thermomechanical processing , enabling the production of bulk , near net-shape forms of the Fe-Co alloy . 
Bulk LENS structures appeared to be ductile with no significant macroscopic defects . 
Fine equiaxed grain structures were observed in as-built specimens following solidification , which then evolved toward a highly heterogeneous bimodal grain structure after annealing . 
The microstructure evolution in Fe-Co is discussed in the context of classical solidification theory and selective grain boundary pinning processes . 
Magnetic properties were also assessed and shown to fall within the extremes of conventionally processed Hiperco® alloys.Hiperco® is a registered trademark of Carpenter Technologies , Readings , PA . 
The use of 3D printing in architecture has grown tremendously over the last decade thanks to its strong reputation as a versatile , cheap and fast technology . 
Its durability , in fact , depends on several factors ( above all design accuracy , quality of materials and environmental aggressiveness ) , which may lead or contribute to rapid performance decay over time . 
With this in mind , the paper describes the design-to-production process for a façade shading system using additive manufacturing and the associated testing campaign to assess the feasibility of the design and durability of materials . 
Horizontal lamellas , with a complex curved geometry , were generated using computational design optimised for additive manufacturing . 
In order to select the most suitable 3D-printable material , tests were conducted on different polymers in a climatic chamber at Politecnico di Milano to monitor material performances over time at high temperatures such as the ones in Dubai . 
The data gathered from these tests was crucial to the correct design of the façade manufacturing process . 
Lattice structures are advantageous in terms of their high specific stiffness and strength , and have been applied to the design of lightweight structures owing to the recent development of additive manufacturing ( AM ) . 
The unique design flexibility of AM has enabled the fabrication of a functionally graded lattice ( FGL ) by gradually changing the lattice size and enhancing structural efficiency of lattice structures . 
Although FGLs have been generally designed to reduce the compliance ( i.e. 
, to increase the stiffness ) , this study aims to develop soft polymeric lattices to widen the range of compliance for the development of FGLs . 
To develop soft lattice structures , various lattices were designed and fabricated using a photo-polymerization type 3D printer and photo-curable polyurethane resin . 
Compression tests were conducted on these lattices , and their deformation behaviors were analyzed experimentally . 
The effects of various lattice design parameters and the curing time were also investigated , and the resulting changes in the compliance were analyzed . 
As a consequence , the compressive stiffness can vary widely , within a range of 10−3 to 102 N/mm . 
Two types of FGLs , which enabled the self-positioning and self-guided moving functions , were then developed by varying the lattice direction , strut diameter and curing time effectively . 
The thermal conductivity of AlSi10Mg made by laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) , and its modification via heat treatment , has received little attention despite possible applications for heat exchangers and thermo-mechanical components . 
Here , we show that heat treatment can increase the thermal conductivity of LPBF AlSi10Mg to that of cast material . 
Our results indicate that post-manufacture annealing eliminates the thermal conductivity anisotropy present in the as-built condition , and enhances the conductivity by close to 30 % in the transverse direction ( perpendicular to the LPBF build orientation ) . 
A solution heat treatment increases the thermal conductivity further still ( 36 % compared to the as-built condition ) , while a T6-like treatment provides the greatest increase ( 44 % compared to the as-built condition ) . 
These improvements are related to the evolution of the AlSi10Mg microstructure , especially the breakdown of the Si cellular structure . 
Additionally , the thermal conductivities of gyroid lattice structures were examined in the as-built and annealed conditions . 
Contrary to solid specimens , the lattice structures exhibited almost isotropic thermal conductivity in the as-built condition . 
Their thermal conductivities were increased by the annealing treatment in proportion to their volume fraction . 
Our findings contribute to the development of a general design-for-additive-manufacturing ( DfAM ) framework which will make the best possible use of AM materials and lattice structures for heat transfer components . 
Building on a large scale with Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) is one of the biggest manufacturing challenges of our time . 
In the last decade , the proliferation of 3D printing has allowed architects and engineers to imagine and develop constructions that can be produced additively . 
However , questions about the convenience of using this technology , and whether additive large-scale constructions can be feasible , efficient and sustainable are still open . 
In this research 3D printing is considered not as a question , but as an answer to the increasing scarcity of material resources in the construction industry . 
This paper illustrates the overarching process from concept to the realisation of the Trabeculae Pavilion , a load-responsive architecture that is entirely designed and optimized for 3D printing , using Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) - one of the most cost-effective additive techniques of production . 
The research methodology is based on a multi-scale computational workflow that integrates several aspects , such as material testing , bio-inspired design algorithms , multi-criteria optimization , and production management . 
The work culminates in the construction process of a full-scale architectural prototype ; an anticlastic shell that features a cellular structure with increased material and structural efficiency . 
Microstructural characterization was carried out on AISI 17-4 PH stainless steel fabricated by selective laser melting ( SLM ) in an argon environment . 
Conventionally , this steel exhibits a martensitic structure with a small fraction of δ ferrite . 
However , the combined findings of x-ray diffraction and electron backscatter diffraction ( EBSD ) proved that SLM-ed 17-4 PH steel has a fully ferritic microstructure , more specifically δ ferrite . 
The microstructure consists of coarse ferritic grains elongated along the build direction , with a pronounced solidification crystallographic texture . 
These results were associated to the high cooling and heating rates experienced throughout the SLM process that suppressed the austenite formation and produced a “ by-passing ” phenomenon of this phase during the numerous thermal cycles . 
Furthermore , the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ( EDS ) measurements revealed a uniform distribution of elements without any dendritic structure . 
The extremely high cooling kinetics induced a diffusionless solidification , resulting in a homogeneous elemental composition . 
It was also found that the ferritic SLM-ed material can be transformed to martensite again by re-austenitization at 1050 °C followed by quenching . 
Electron Beam Melting ( EBM ) has the potentiality of being an effective system in terms of time and energy consumption . 
Among the different additive manufacturing processes that are available , the EBM process has shown the lowest Specific Energy Consumption ( SEC ) and the highest average Deposition Rate ( DRa ) . 
Moreover , all the literature studies have only an analysis of energy efficiency during the melting of the bulk material phase and have adopted a fixed job design . 
A black-box approach is applied to provide a new model for the energy efficiency of the EBM process . 
Different jobs have been designed to analyse the effect of a part and of manufacturing designs . 
Bulk material , support and lattice structures have been included . 
The design has therefore been aimed at investigating the effect of the building height , melted area and process themes on energy efficiency . 
The jobs have been produced using Arcam A2X and Standard Arcam Ti6Al4V powders . 
According to this research , the architecture of the machine and its control of the process have the main impact on the relationship between SEC and DRa . 
Additionally , the empirical approach applied to the machine subunits has highlighted that only a small part of the total energy demand is needed to power the electron beam during the melting phase , while the remaining part guarantees the good machine working conditions . 
Laser powder bed fusion , is an additive manufacturing technology that is used in industry for rapid prototyping and manufacturing of aftermarket products , molds and special machine parts . 
Quality assurance and process stability still require improvement until this technology is ready for large scale serial production . 
Scan strategies and parameter sets for manufacturing are often fixed when certification processes are finished . 
Thus , it is important to test the manufacturability of specific design features such as inner channels . 
In the following we will present the qualification of inner channels in different test parts for the aluminum alloy AlSi10Mg and the stainless steel 1.4542 . 
The testing includes different cleaning methods and air flow rate measurements . 
Additionally , we will compare such parts and LPBF specific problems to observations with a coaxial melt pool monitoring system . 
A system for the additive manufacturing of functionally graded concrete parts was developed . 
It is possible to 3D print functionally graded concrete parts by varying the type and ratio of aggregates . 
Homogeneous and functionally graded parts were produced with the system . 
Cork is a viable natural aggregate for concrete printing . 
In recent years , the interest in developing additive manufacturing ( AM ) technologies in the architecture , engineering and construction ( AEC ) industry has increased , motivated by the potential to support greater formal complexity . 
In this context , AM has been largely used to design and fabricate physical parts with homogeneous materials . 
This paper proposes a new strategy , aimed at the design and fabrication of functionally graded concrete parts with specific thermo-mechanical performance . 
The paper describes the development of the AM system to materialize such parts . 
The computational tool developed to design the material to meet specific performance requirements , and the design and testing of the material are described elsewhere . 
A functionally graded concrete part obtained by replacing sand with cork was produced and is evaluated . 
Mechanical properties ( tensile strength and creep ) of AlSi10Mg specimens fabricated by selective laser melting ( SLM ) in the Z-direction were investigated in the 25–400 °C temperature range . 
Specimens were tested after stress relief treatment . 
The results revealed that yield stress ( YS ) significantly decreases and the elongation increases at temperatures higher than 200 °C . 
The ultimate tensile stress ( UTS ) continuously decreases with temperature . 
The creep parameters , namely stress exponent n and apparent activation energy Q , were found to be 25 ± 2 and 146 ± 20 kJ/mole , respectively . 
It was shown that plastic deformation during creep is governed by dislocation movements in primary aluminum grains . 
The tested material is actually an aluminum composite reinforced by sub-micron Si particles . 
The creep resistance of AlSi10Mg alloy fabricated by selective laser melting is close to that for aluminum matrix particles reinforced composites . 
Recyclability of Ti-6Al-4 V powder by EBM process has been investigated . 
The effect of powder recycling was explored using metallographic and mechanical testing . 
Recycling causes various defects to appear in Ti-6Al-4 V powder , having a negative effect on the EBM process . 
HIP significantly improves the quality of the samples made from recycled powder . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) , also called 3D-printing , is an innovative technology , as the printing of objects is performed by layer-by-layer deposition . 
A wide variety of materials can be used to produce a variety of shapes that can not be achieved using any other technology . 
AM started as a prototyping in plastics , and now it is successfully implemented with metals . 
AM in metals , first of all , in Titanium alloys , offers the potential to not only generate net-shape , complex geometrical and light-weight objects , but also to achieve enhanced mechanical properties , even better than achieved by traditional mass production , like casting.However , the priority of achieving good non-porous microstructure and the desired mechanical properties is a challenge for the main fields of applications of Titanium AM , such as the aerospace industry and production of medical implants . 
Thus , the quality of the powder and standardization of the AM process are the top priority . 
The potential recycling of the Ti-6Al-4 V powder as an inextricable part of the AM process needs to be explored.The influence of powder recycling on Ti-6Al-4 V additive manufacturing , the correct number of cycles , the requirements of the recycling procedures , and possible post processing procedures – are still open questions . 
This research aims to answer these questions . 
Two identical test cylinder sets were printed , one from recycled powder and one from the new powder batch . 
The cylinders were printed by the Arcam EBM A2X machine using a start platform of 210 x 210 mm in size . 
Electron Beam Melting ( EBM ) is a well-known effective manufacturing process . 
This AM technology utilizes high power electron beam to produce layer-by-layer metal parts for various applications , such as fabrication of biomedical implants and aerospace components . 
The microstructure and mechanical properties of the printed specimens from the two sets ( new and recycled Ti-6Al-4 V powder ) were investigated before and after heat treatment . 
A novel approach to fabricate ceramic structures at multiple scales in a single component , based on the hybridization of additive manufacturing technologies , was developed by combining 3D macro-stereolithography ( Digital Light Processing , DLP ) with two-photon lithography ( 2PL ) , to produce cm-sized sample geometries with sub-μm surface features . 
The preceramic structures in the sub-μm scale were realized by 2PL directly on easily manageable DLP macro-sized samples of the same ceramic composition . 
In this way , preceramic structures presenting both features typical of DLP printers ( with a minimum size of around 50 μm ) and features well below their resolution limit were realized . 
We report here , for the first time , the realization of polymer-derived ceramic SiOC ceramic components structured in 3D across several length scales ( with micron and mesoscale 3D features ) , produced by pyrolysis at 1000 °C of preceramic parts , without shape distortion during the pyrolysis step . 
The effect of varying the solids volume fraction of an aqueous clay paste suspension on its printability via an Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) or 3D printing technique , Direct Ink Writing ( DIW ) or material extrusion , has been studied . 
DIW is a cost-effective and straightforward fabrication technology suitable for adoption at a larger-scale by the traditional ceramics industry and the creative community . 
The pastes were prepared with volume fraction of solids ranging from 25 to 57 vol % . 
Their rheological properties ( storage modulus and apparent yield stress ) were measured by dynamic oscillatory rheometry . 
The relationships between solids content , rheological behaviour and print parameters were evaluated . 
An equation based on rheological properties to delineate between printable and non-printable conditions has been proposed . 
In this study , we present the first results of a newly developed melt pool monitoring tool for selective laser melting , called DMP-meltpool . 
A manual data analysis method is given , and the events indicated by the analysis ( DMP-meltpool events ) are shown to correlate to the static tensile properties of the samples built . 
These events indicate the probability of material discontinuities ( defects ) in the metal additive manufacturing ( AM ) parts . 
In order to do so , cylindrical bars of Ti-6Al-4V ELI were built and monitored using DMP-meltpool . 
The tensile properties of the printed cylinders were correlated with the events detected by DMP-meltpool . 
An inverse relation between plastic elongation and the DMP-meltpool event density was observed . 
These results show that DMP-meltpool can be used to predict the quality of AM parts by detecting variations in the signals and tagging these events throughout the build as defects . 
Thus the technique can be employed for first stage in-line quality control of AM parts and for sorting out parts with potential defects non-destructively . 
The DMP-meltpool events could have significant correlations with other mechanical properties ( like fatigue , hardness , fracture toughness , and crack propagation ) since such properties are influenced by defects originating from the process instabilities . 
This study compares the mechanical response and microstructure of Co–Cr–Mo removable partial denture models made through conventional lost-wax casting and the selective laser melting additive manufacturing process . 
Co–Cr–Mo clasps for removal partial dentures , based on a wax model ( BEGO USA ) , were fabricated through lost-wax technique and selective laser melting , and subjected to mechanical bending experiments to determine their yield strength and maximum reversible deformation . 
Microstructure and chemical composition of the clasps were determined through scanning electron microscopy and wave-dispersive spectroscopy to rationalize the differences and similarities in the mechanical testing results from the two groups.It was found that the clasps made using lost-wax technique and selective laser melting exhibit comparable mean yield strengths and maximum elastic deformations , however the underlying microstructure of the cast clasps vastly differs from the laser-melted counterparts . 
Furthermore , the laser melted clasps exhibit larger variability in their mechanical response . 
While selective laser melting is capable of producing removable partial denture clasps with similar average mechanical responses to those of lost-wax cast counterparts , additional studies should be conducted to minimize the variability in the laser melted clasps in order to minimize unexpected failures . 
Optical Emissions Spectroscopy and plume imaging were utilized to investigate flaws generated during directed energy deposition additive manufacturing . 
Ti-6Al–4 V coupons were built using varying laser power , powder flow rate , and hatching pattern to induce random and systematic flaws . 
X-Ray Computed Tomography ( CT ) scans were completed on each part to determine flaw density and flaw locations . 
For coupons built with constant laser power , variations in either powder flow rate or hatch pattern that led to an increase in flaw density were accompanied by an increase in median line-to-continuum ratios around 430 and 520 nm and in total plume area . 
These results present a path forward for real-time flaw detection and assessment of build quality in directed energy deposition and powder bed fusion processes . 
This study examines the impact of low-temperature heat-treatment on the microstructure and corrosion performance of direct metal laser sintered ( DMLS ) -AlSi10Mg alloy . 
Differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) was used to determine the phase ( s ) transition temperatures in the alloy . 
Two exothermic phenomena were detected and associated with the Mg2Si precipitation and Si phase precipitation in the as-printed alloy . 
Based on DSC results , thermal-treatments including below and above the active Si precipitation temperature at 200 °C and 300 °C , respectively , and 350 °C as an upper limit temperature for 3 h were applied to the as-printed samples . 
Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that heat-treatment from 200 °C to 350 °C promotes the homogeneity of the microstructure , characterized by uniform distribution of eutectic Si in α-Al matrix . 
To investigate the impact of the applied heat-treatment cycles on corrosion resistance of DMLS-AlSi10Mg at early stage of immersion , anodic polarization testing and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were performed in aerated 3.5 wt. 
% NaCl solution . 
The results revealed more uniformly distributed pitting attack on the corroded surfaces by increasing the heat-treatment temperature up to 300 °C , attributed to the more protective nature of the spontaneously air-formed passive layer on the surface of the alloy at initial immersion time . 
Further increase of the heat treatment temperature to 350 °C induced severe localized corrosion attacks near the coarse Si particles , ascribed to the increased potential difference between the coalesced Si particles and aluminum matrix galvanic couple . 
In comparison , the corrosion of the as-printed and 200 °C heat treated samples was characterized by a penetrating selective attack along the melt pool boundaries , leading to a higher corrosion current density and an active surface at early exposure , associated with the weakness of the existing passive film on their surfaces . 
A testing methodology was developed to expose photopolymer resins and measure the cured material to determine two key parameters related to the photopolymerization process : Ec ( critical energy to initiate polymerization ) and Dp ( penetration depth of curing light ) . 
Five commercially available resins were evaluated under exposure from 365 nm and 405 nm light at varying power densities and energies . 
Caliper measurements , stylus profilometry , and confocal laser scanning microscopy showed similar results for hard materials while caliper measurement of a soft , elastomeric material proved inaccurate . 
Working curves for the five photopolymers showed unique behavior both within and among the resins as a function of curing light wavelength . 
Ec and Dp for the five resins showed variations as large as 10x . 
Variations of this magnitude , if unknown to the user and not controlled for , will clearly affect printed part quality . 
Rapid prototyping of smart objects with embedded electronics . 
Integrated additive manufacturing approach . 
Polymer/metal nanocomposite conductive lines with controlled electrical properties . 
Fabrication of conductive 3D oblique paths , bridging vias and standard sockets . 
Freeform monolithic smart nightlight sensor . 
We present an integrated additive manufacturing approach for the rapid prototyping of objects with embedded electric circuits . 
Our approach relies on the combined use of standard fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) for the production of thermoplastic 3D freeform components , and supersonic cluster beam deposition ( SCBD ) for the fabrication of embedded electrical conducting lines and resistors with tailored conductivity . 
SCBD is an additive fabrication technique based on the deposition of neutral metallic clusters carried in a highly collimated supersonic beam . 
A multi-step fabrication procedure alternating FFF and SCBD was developed and optimized allowing the fabrication of conductive 3D oblique paths , bridging vias , and sockets for standard electronic components fitting . 
This resulted in the simplification of the topology of planar electric circuits by enabling out-of-plane connections , minimizing the implementation of bulky passive electrical components and avoiding the use of soldering and conductive adhesives for the integration of active electronic components . 
A dark-activated light sensor was produced as a demonstrator . 
Polyolefin thermoplastics like high density polyethylene ( HDPE ) are the leaders in terms of world-scale plastics ’ production , environmentally benign polymerization processes , recycling , and sustainability . 
However , additive manufacturing of HDPE by means of fused deposition modeling ( FDM ) also known as fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) has been problematic owing to its massive shrinkage , voiding and warpage problems accompanied by its poor adhesion to common build plates and to extruded HDPE strands . 
Herein we overcome these problems and improve Young ’ s modulus , tensile strength and surface quality of 3D printed HDPE by varying 3D printing parameters like temperature and diameter of the nozzle , extrusion rate , build plate temperature , and build plate material . 
Both nozzle diameter and printing speed affect surface quality but do not impair mechanical properties . 
Particularly , an extrusion rate gradient prevents void formation . 
For the first time additive manufactured HDPE and injection-molded HDPE exhibit similar mechanical properties with exception of elongation at break . 
Excellent fusion of the extruded polymer strands and the absence of anisotropy are achieved , as verified by microscopic imaging and measuring the tensile strength parallel and perpendicular to the 3D printing direction . 
Refractory elements have high melting points and are difficult to melt and cast . 
In this study it is successfully demonstrated for the first time that laser metal deposition can be used to produce TiZrNbHfTa high-entropy alloy from a blend of elemental powders by in-situ alloying . 
Columnar specimens with a height of 10 mm and a diameter of 3 mm were deposited with a pulsed Nd : YAG laser . 
The built-up specimen has near-equiatomic composition , nearly uniform grain size , equiaxed grain shape , is bcc single phase and exhibits a high hardness of 509 HV0.2 . 
Material properties of parts made via selective laser melting are not the same as the well-established properties for bulk base materials , due to the unique processes used to produce the parts . 
Meanwhile , additive manufacturing is increasingly being used for heat exchangers and heat removal devices , which demand high thermal conductivities . 
The thermal properties are also important for many non-destructive testing technologies . 
The thermal conductivity of selective laser melted 316 L stainless steel was studied as a function of processing conditions and build orientation . 
The porosity and thermal conductivity were measured versus processing conditions . 
A critical energy density of 44.4 J/mm3 was observed below which the porosity increased and the thermal conductivity decreased . 
For the lowest-porosity sample , the local thermal conductivity map taken with frequency domain thermoreflectance showed a variation in the stainless steel thermal conductivity between 10.4 and 19.8 W/m-K , while the average thermal conductivity of 14.3 W/m-K from the thermal conductivity map agreed , within measurement uncertainty , with the bulk thermal conductivity measurements . 
The thermal conductivity trend was not fully explained by the porosity , as effective medium models fail to predict the trend . 
Amorphous stripes in the selective laser melted stainless steel grains were identified by transmission electron microscopy . 
These amorphous regions also resulted in decreased x-ray diffraction intensities with increasing porosity . 
The amorphous regions are hypothesized to lower the thermal conductivity at faster laser scanning speeds due to less time at elevated temperatures . 
We also found that in-print plane and through-print plane thermal conductivities have the same value when the energy density is greater than this critical amount . 
When the energy density reduces below this critical amount , the in-plane conductivity exceeds the through-plane . 
Inconel 718 alloy rods were fabricated by electron–beam melting ( EBM ) , where the cylindrical axes ( CAs ) deviated from the build directions ( BD ) by 0° , 45° , 55° , and 90° . 
The microstructures and high-temperature tensile properties of the rods were investigated by taking into account the effect of the BD . 
Columnar grain structures or mixtures of columnar and equiaxed grains were obtained in the rods . 
As a result , the crystal orientation of the rods could be controlled by appropriate choice of the CA . 
The highest strength was obtained for the < 1 1 1 > oriented rod . 
The dependence of strength on the rod orientation could be explained in terms of the anisotropies in the crystal orientation , columnar grain structure , and arrangement of the precipitate particles . 
This paper presents the very first study on additive manufacturing ( AM ) of a high melting point near-eutectic V–9Si–5B alloy via direct energy deposition ( DED ) . 
Tailored V–9Si–5B powder material was produced by means of a gas atomization ( GA ) process . 
A novel setup for the DED experiments was developed and an overview of the production parameters for manufacturing of crack-free specimens is given . 
The microstructural evolution of the three-phase V–9Si–5B alloy is described by means of SEM , EBSD and STEM analyses during the entire process chain , i.e . 
the gas atomization of the powder material , the consolidation via DED and the heat treatment of the compacts . 
First mechanical tests demonstrate the high hardness and the competitive creep resistance of the AM V–9Si–5B material in comparison to other three-phase V-based alloys . 
Metal additive manufacturing offers a tool to bring formerly unmanufacturable , geometrically complex , engineered structures into existence . 
However , considerable challenges remain in controlling the unique microstructures , defects and properties that are created through this process . 
For the first time this work demonstrates how LaB6 nanoparticles can be used to control such features in Al alloys produced by Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) . 
A novel and efficient mechanical agitation process is used to inoculate AlSi10Mg powder with LaB6 nanoparticles which resulted in a homogenous , crack-free , equiaxed , very fine-grained as built microstructures . 
The substantial grain refinement is attributed to the good crystallographic atomic matching across the Al/LaB6 interfaces which facilitated Al nucleation on the LaB6 nanoparticles . 
The LaB6-inoculated AlSi10Mg exhibited near-isotropic mechanical properties with an improved plasticity compared with un modified AlSi10Mg . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) has become one of the most commonly utilized processes in metal additive manufacturing ( AM ) . 
Despite its widespread use and capabilities , SLM parts are still being produced with excessive volumetric defects and flaws . 
The complex dependence of defect formation on process parameters , geometry , and material properties has inhibited effective quality assurance in SLM production . 
Exacerbating these issues are the difficulties thus far in accurately detecting and identifying defects in-process so that parts may be qualified without destructive testing . 
Some of the most detrimental defects produced during SLM processing are lack of fusion ( LoF ) defects , which are frequently found to be in excess of 100 μm in size , thus these defects are of critical importance to detect and remove . 
In this work , we have developed and demonstrated the capabilities of a novel in situ monitoring system using full-field infrared ( IR ) thermography to monitor AlSi10Mg specimens during SLM production . 
Using layerwise relative surface temperature measurements , subsurface defects were identified via their retained thermal signature at the surface ; transient thermal modeling was performed , which supported these observations . 
Parts were characterized using ex situ scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) to validate data identified defects and , critically , to estimate detection success . 
The IR defect detection method was highly effective in identifying defects , with an 82 % total success rate for LoF defects ; detection success improved with increasing defect size . 
The method was also used statistically to analyze the presence of systematic process errors during SLM production , expanding the capabilities of IR monitoring methods . 
This unique analysis method and simple integration for in situ IR monitoring can immediately improve non-destructive qualification methods in SLM processing . 
Additive manufacturing has opened doors for the efficient fabrication of individually tailored and complicated functional parts . 
However , the three-dimensional ( 3D ) printing process is vulnerable to defects generation , necessitating the need for in-situ monitoring and control technologies for quality assessment of parts . 
An in-situ monitoring system ( IMS ) based on optical imaging was developed in-house for implementation on the selective laser melting process . 
A digital single lens reflex camera , mirror and several sets of light emitting diode strip lights formed the main constituents of the IMS . 
Cylindrical samples of 316 L stainless steel were printed with variations in their energy density . 
Features taken in optical images were extracted and evaluated via image processing . 
Micro computed tomography ( CT ) , which is capable of assessing the internal defects and recovering the 3D representation of a structure , was used as a validation method to correlate the features identified in the optical images . 
Results have shown that features captured in-situ were correlated to defects detected by micro CT , revealing the potential of using optical images captured during printing as an indicator to the extent of defects present in selective laser melted parts . 
In recent years , the fabrication of aluminum alloy parts via laser powder bed fusion has been extensively considered in the biomedical , aerospace , and other industrial sectors , as it provides advantages such as the ability to manufacture complex shapes with high performance associated with lightweight design . 
However , surface irregularities and sub-surface defects limit the full exploitation of such parts in fatigue-critical applications . 
Moreover , most of the commonly used metrological methods for surface characterization have proven to be unsuitable for determining important features such as undercuts and sub-surfaces pores . 
Hence , a comprehensive coupled investigation of metrological methods and cross-sectional analysis were performed in this study to evaluate the effects of surface features and volumetric defects typical of additively manufactured materials . 
Fatigue tests and fractographic analyses were conducted to support the finite element simulations and proposed fracture mechanics model . 
The results demonstrate that the standard metrological methods can not provide all of the data needed to model the fatigue behaviors of additively manufactured materials robustly . 
Moreover , a statistical model describing the competition between volumetric defects and surface irregularities was developed and validated . 
Different L-PBF process parameters were used to additively manufacture AHSS . 
FEM simulations quantified solidification parameters and melt pool shapes . 
High cooling rate parameters resulted in high GND densities and yield strength . 
M & S scan strategy revealed a partial columnar to equiaxed transition . 
In this work , the additive manufacturing technique of laser powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) was used to build up X30Mn21 austenitic advanced high strength steel ( AHSS ) samples . 
Different L-PBF process parameters were used to understand the correlation between process , microstructure , texture , and mechanical properties . 
The influence of build platform preheating ( 200 °C–800 °C ) , laser speed ( 550 mm/s - 950 mm/s ) and scan strategy ( bidirectional continuous and Mark & Sleep ( M & S ) ) on grain size , grain morphology , size of solidification cells , dislocation density , and texture was studied . 
Local solidification parameters in the melt pool e.g . 
cooling rates , temperature gradients and solidification velocities were simulated by a FEM heat flow model and correlated with the solidification microstructure . 
By using SEM/EBSD analysis and tensile testing , the mechanical properties of the AHSS were assessed by considering microstructural aspects . 
It was found that AHSS , produced with higher laser speeds and an alternative M & S scan strategy , revealed a reduced grain size and texture intensity . 
This was attributed to a partial columnar to equiaxed transition ( CET ) , as well as a significantly increased density of geometrically necessary dislocations . 
Preheating of the build platform promoted columnar grain growth with a more pronounced texture , low dislocation densities , and reduced yield strength . 
The influence of cooling rate , temperature gradient and solidification velocity on microstructural and textural evolution is discussed based on fundamental solidification theories . 
The process chain of this method starts with injection molding . 
The polymer of this part is functionalized with LDS-additives which allow the part to be laser structured subsequently . 
This technique is less suitable for prototypes and small-scale productions of 3D-MIDs because of its properties . 
Contrary to the injection molding process , the additive manufacturing ( AM ) , such as powder bed based manufacturing processes , e.g . 
selective laser sintering ( SLS ) , is a constantly emerging processing technology for the fabrication of prototypes and small-scale productions . 
Unmodified polyamide 12 ( PA 12 ) , e.g . 
PA2200 ( supplier : EOS GmbH ) is most commonly used for the SLS of polymer parts . 
The LPKF Laser & Electronics AG in Garbsen , Germany , transferred the LDS-method to SLS-process . 
A standard SLS-polymer part is coated with a special paint , that contains the necessary LDS-additives . 
Once coated and dried , these parts can be laser direct structured similar to standard 3D-MIDs . 
In this study , the authors use copper particles in order to functionalize a standard polyamide 12 powder for laser activation and selective metallization . 
The study shows , that the addition of copper particles enables the laser direct structuring of polyamide 12 . 
SLS-demonstrators were successfully laser activated and selectively metallized . 
Furthermore , the copper particles enhance the mechanical properties as well as the heat conductivity of polyamide 12 . 
Lattice density and fabric are combined to predict anisotropic mechanical properties . 
The resulting model is validated by mechanical testing in at least 10 directions . 
Off-axis properties for Ti6Al4V and nylon lattices predicted to within 13 and 5.1 % . 
Predictions and mechanical data are correlated with R2 between 0.84 and 0.94 . 
Additive manufacturing methods present opportunities for structures to have tailored mechanical anisotropy by integrating controlled lattice structures into their design . 
The ability to predict anisotropic mechanical properties of such lattice structures would help tailor anisotropy and ensure adequate off-axis strength at an early stage in the design process . 
A method is described for the development of a model to predict apparent modulus and strength based on structure density and fabric , taken from CAD data . 
The model utilises a tensorial form of well-founded power-law relationships for these variables and is fit to mechanical test data for properties in the principal directions of manufactured titanium stochastic lattices and nylon rhombic dodecahedron structures . 
The results are validated against mechanical testing across at least 7 additional off-axis directions . 
For stochastic structures , apparent modulus is predicted in 10 directions with a mean error of 13 % and strength predicted with a mean error of 10 % . 
For rhombic dodecahedron structures apparent modulus and strength are predicted in 15 directions with mean errors of 4.2 % and 5.1 % respectively . 
This model is the first to predict the anisotropic apparent modulus and strength of structures based on lattice density and fabric tensors and will be highly useful in the mechanical design of lattice structures . 
A robotized laser/wire direct metal deposition system was utilized to fabricate 316LSi coupons . 
The mechanical and microstructural properties were then characterized . 
It was found that different thermal histories caused by different inter-layer time intervals have significant impact on mechanical and microstructural properties . 
The thin-walled samples with lower cooling rates showed coarser columnar grains , lower ultimate tensile strength , and lower hardness compared to the block samples . 
The melt pool was monitored in real-time . 
An empirical correlation between the melt pool area and cooling rate was achieved that could enable control of scale of the final solidification structure by maintaining the melt pool size in real-time . 
Further , to study the anisotropic behavior , tensile samples were loaded in parallel and perpendicular directions with respect to the deposition direction . 
The results indicated that samples in the perpendicular direction had lower UTS and elongation for both coupon types , revealing a weaker bonding at inter-layer/bead interface due to the existence of lack-of-fusion pores . 
The capability to additively manufacture fully-functioning electronic circuits is a frontier in 3D-printed electronics that will afford unprecedented scalability , miniaturization , and conformability of electronic circuits . 
In this paper , we report a novel procedure that employs three-dimensional ( 3D ) additive manufacturing techniques to fabricate high-frequency , tapered-solenoid type inductors for RF applications capable of wide bandwidth performance . 
The design includes a polymer support structure to reduce the parasitic capacitance between the inductor and the substrate , a tapered solid core , and conducting windings . 
Each design component is printed using aerosol-jet ( AJ ) printing methods on a grounded coplanar waveguide such that the small end of the conical-shaped inductor is connected to the transmission line and the base of the inductor is connected to ground . 
Two types of solid-core inductors were fabricated : one with a printed polymer core and another with a non-printed iron core . 
Scattering parameter measurements establish that the polymer and iron-core inductors , combined with a 45°-polymer support structure , can achieve usable bandwidths up to 18 GHz and 40 GHz , respectively , with low insertion loss . 
3D model and circuit model simulations were also carried out to study inductor performance in terms of self-resonance and insertion loss . 
The use of manufacturing to generate topology optimized components shows promise for designers . 
However , designers who assume that additive manufacturing follows traditional manufacturing techniques may be misled due to the nuances in specific techniques . 
Since commercial topology optimization software tools are neither designed to consider orientation of the parts nor large variations in properties , the goal of this research is to evaluate the limitations of an existing commercial topology optimization software ( i.e . 
Inspire® ) using electron beam powder bed fusion ( i.e . 
Arcam® ) to produce optimized Ti-6Al-4V alloy components . 
Emerging qualification tools from Oak Ridge National Laboratory including in-situ near-infrared imaging and log file data analysis were used to rationalize the final performance of components . 
While the weight savings of each optimized part exceeded the initial criteria , the failure loads and locations proved instrumental in providing insight to additive manufacturing with topology optimization . 
This research has shown the need for a comprehensive understanding of correlations between geometry , additive manufacturing processing conditions , defect generation , and microstructure for characterization of complex components such as those designed by topology optimization . 
Ni-Cu-base alloy plates have been obtained by wire arc additive manufacturing technology . 
Dendritic structure and particle precipitation have been found to significantly depend on alloy composition , in particular Mn , Ti and C contents . 
Higher hardness , strength , toughness and wear resistance in one of the tested alloys were associated with precipitation of TiCN particles . 
Moderate dependence of microstructural parameters and mechanical properties on deposition speed was observed within the tested speed range . 
Two Ni-Cu alloys ( Monel K500 and FM 60 ) having various Mn , Fe , Al , Ti and C contents were deposited on a Monel K500 plate at three different speeds using wire arc additive manufacturing technique . 
Microstructure characterisation , in particular a detailed study of precipitates , was carried out using optical and scanning electron microscopy . 
Mechanical properties were assessed using hardness , tensile and wear testing . 
For similar deposition conditions , Monel K500 has exhibited smaller secondary dendrite arm spacing and higher number density of Ti-rich particles , although the Ti concentration in FM 60 was higher . 
Finer microstructure and Ti precipitation led to superior hardness , tensile and wear resistance of Monel K500 compared to FM 60 . 
The variation in microstructure-properties relationship with alloy composition is discussed . 
We devised a novel method to embed sensors or integrated circuit ( IC ) chips into metal components by using a selective laser melting ( SLM ) process . 
The concept of a protective layer is introduced to fabricate all parts without damaging the sensors during the laser scanning process . 
The operation of sensors in the parts is analyzed from a computational analysis on the thermal influence of laser heat . 
The fabricated metal parts show continuous microstructures including grains and phases between the base part and the new part formed after embedding the sensor despite the intermittent SLM process . 
The embedded sensor operates properly when compared to bare sensors . 
Plastic circuit board-based IC components were embedded into an Inconel 718C turbine blade , which accurately distinguished three-dimensional vibration along the X , Y , and Z axes . 
Our results imply that the proposed process can open new avenues for SLM technology to realize metal components with a self-cognitive ability using integrated sensors . 
Printed free-standing pure Au structure with feature sizes of smaller than 10 microns . 
Combination of laser-induced forward transfer of pure metals and chemical etching . 
Approach allows fully overhanging structures and reduces substrate contamination . 
Cu support structures can be selectively removed after LIFT-printing . 
A combined approach of laser-induced forward transfer ( LIFT ) and chemical etching of pure metal films is studied to fabricate complex , free-standing , 3-dimensional gold structures on the few micron scale . 
A picosecond pulsed laser source with 515 nm central wavelength is used to deposit metal droplets of copper and gold in a sequential fashion . 
After transfer , chemical etching in ferric chloride completely removes the mechanical Cu support leaving a final free-standing gold structure . 
Unprecedented feature sizes of smaller than 10 μm are achieved with surface roughness of 0.3 to 0.7 μm . 
Formation of interfacial mixing volumes between the two metals is not found confirming the viability of the approach . 
Additive manufacturing promises to revolutionize manufacturing industries . 
However , 3D printing of novel build materials is currently limited by constraints inherent to printer designs . 
In this work , a bench-top powder melt extrusion ( PME ) 3D printer head was designed and fabricated to print parts directly from powder-based materials rather than filament . 
The final design of the PME printer head evolved from the Rich Rap Universal Pellet Extruder ( RRUPE ) design and was realized through an iterative approach . 
The PME printer was made possible by modifications to the funnel shape , pressure applied to the extrudate by the auger , and hot end structure . 
Through comparison of parts printed with the PME printer with those from a commercially available fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) 3D printer using common thermoplastics poly ( lactide ) ( PLA ) , high impact poly ( styrene ) ( HIPS ) , and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS ) powders ( < 1 mm in diameter ) , evaluation of the printer performance was performed . 
For each build material , the PME printed objects show comparable viscoelastic properties by dynamic mechanical analysis ( DMA ) to those of the FFF objects . 
However , due to a significant difference in printer resolution between PME ( X–Y resolution of 0.8 mm and a Z-layer height calibrated to 0.1 mm ) and FFF ( X–Y resolution of 0.4 mm and a Z-layer height of 0.18 mm ) , as well as , an inherently more inconsistent feed of build material for PME than FFF , the resulting print quality , determined by a dimensional analysis and surface roughness comparisons , of the PME printed objects was lower than that of the FFF printed parts based on the print layer uniformity and structure . 
Further , due to the poorer print resolution and inherent inconsistent build material feed of the PME , the bulk tensile strength and Young ’ s moduli of the objects printed by PME were lower and more inconsistent ( 49.2 ± 10.7 MPa and 1620 ± 375 MPa , respectively ) than those of FFF printed objects ( 57.7 ± 2.31 MPa and 2160 ± 179 MPa , respectively ) . 
Nevertheless , PME print methods promise an opportunity to provide a platform on which it is possible to rapidly prototype a myriad of thermoplastic materials for 3D printing . 
Effects of laser conditions on part qualities of a near-eutectic Al-Fe alloy fabricated via laser powder bed fusion was investigated . 
The much refined microstructure consisting of nano-scaled Al-Fe intertmetallics with different size and morphology was observed . 
P·v-1/2 based on deposited energy density model was proved to be a more appropriate design parameter . 
An estimated threshold value of P·v-1/2 for fabricating satisfactory Al-2.5Fe ( mass % ) alloy parts could be identified . 
This study focused on additive manufacturing ( AM ) of the Al–Fe binary alloy samples with a near-eutectic composition of 2.5 mass % Fe using the laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) process . 
The melt pool depth , relative density , and hardness of LPBF-fabricated Al–2.5Fe alloy samples under different laser power ( P ) and scan speed ( v ) conditions were systematically examined . 
The results provided optimum laser parameter sets ( P = 204 W , v ≤ 800 mms-1 ) for the fabrication of dense alloy samples with high relative densities > 99 % . 
Additionally , Pv-1/2 , which is based on the deposited energy density model , was found to be a more appropriate parameter for additively manufacturing Al–2.5Fe alloy samples , and using it to simplify the relative densities of the samples made the determination of a threshold value for the laser parameters required to fabricate dense alloy samples . 
The microstructural and crystallographic characterization of the LPBF-built Al–2.5Fe alloy samples revealed a characteristic microstructure consisting of multi-scan melt pools that resulted from local melting and rapid solidification owing to laser irradiation during the LPBF process . 
Furthermore , a number of columnar grains with a mean width of ∼ 21 μm elongated along the building direction were also observed in the α-Al matrix . 
Numerous nano-sized particles of the metastable Al6Fe intermetallic phase with a mean size < 100 nm were finely dispersed in the α-Al matrix . 
The hardness of the refined microstructure produced by the LPBF process was high at ∼ 90 HV , which is more than twofold higher than that of conventionally casted alloys that contain the coarsened plate-shaped Al13Fe4 intermetallic phase in equilibrium with the α-Al matrix . 
In-situ monitoring of metal additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes is a key issue to determine the quality and stability of the process during the layer-wise production of the part . 
The quantities that can be measured via in-situ sensing can be referred to as “ process signatures ” , and can represent the source of information to detect possible defects . 
Most of the literature on in-situ monitoring of Laser Power Bed Fusion ( LPBF ) processes focuses on the melt-pool , laser track and layer image as source of information to detect the onset of possible defects . 
High-speed image acquisition , coupled with image segmentation and feature extraction , is used to estimate different statistical descriptors of the spattering behaviour along the laser scan path . 
A logistic regression model is developed to determine the ability of spatter-related descriptors to classify different energy density conditions corresponding to different quality states . 
This is why future research on spatter signature analysis and modelling is highly encouraged to improve the effectiveness of in-situ monitoring tools . 
The metal additive manufacturing industry is rising and so is the interest in new lattice structures with unique mechanical properties . 
Many studies have already investigated lattice structures with different geometries and their influence on mechanical properties , but little is known about the effect of specific processing characteristics that are inherent to metal additive manufacturing . 
Therefore this study investigates the effect of two crucial steps in the manufacturing process : the build orientation selection and heat treatment . 
In total the microstructure and static mechanical properties of five different orientations and three heat treatment conditions were evaluated using Ti6Al4V diamond like lattice structures . 
The results show a significant decrease in mechanical strength for samples that are built diagonally and a transformation of the microstructure after a HIP ( hot isostatic pressing ) treatment , resulting in a lower maximum strength , but higher ductility . 
In general , horizontal struts should be avoided during manufacturing , unless the applied load after manufacturing can be properly supported by other struts . 
Both a stress relief heat treatment and a HIP treatment can be used in statically loaded applications , whereas a HIP treatment is believed to be beneficial for dynamically loaded applications . 
This study enables an appropriate selection of build orientation and heat treatment of lattice structures for different applications . 
We report the design of a metal powder bed fusion system for in-situ monitoring of the build process during additive manufacture . 
Its open-architecture design was originally determined to enable access for x-rays to the melt pool , but it also provides access to the build area for a range of other in-situ measurement techniques . 
The system is sufficiently automated to enable single tracks and high-density , multiple layer components to be built . 
It is easily transportable to enable measurements at different measurement facilities and its modular design enables straightforward modification for the specific measurements being made . 
We demonstrate that the system produces components with > 99 % density . 
Hence the build conditions are representative to observe process fundamentals and to develop process control strategies . 
In this work a finite-element framework for the numerical simulation of the heat transfer analysis of additive manufacturing processes by powder-bed technologies , such as Selective Laser Melting , is presented . 
These kind of technologies allow for a layer-by-layer metal deposition process to cost-effectively create , directly from a CAD model , complex functional parts such as turbine blades , fuel injectors , heat exchangers , medical implants , among others . 
The numerical model proposed accounts for different heat dissipation mechanisms through the surrounding environment and is supplemented by a finite-element activation strategy , based on the born-dead elements technique , to follow the growth of the geometry driven by the metal deposition process , in such a way that the same scanning pattern sent to the numerical control system of the AM machine is used . 
An experimental campaign has been carried out at the Monash Centre for Additive Manufacturing using an EOSINT-M280 machine where it was possible to fabricate different benchmark geometries , as well as to record the temperature measurements at different thermocouple locations . 
The experiment consisted in the simultaneous printing of two walls with a total deposition volume of 107 cm3 in 992 layers and about 33,500 s build time . 
A large number of numerical simulations have been carried out to calibrate the thermal FE framework in terms of the thermophysical properties of both solid and powder materials and suitable boundary conditions . 
Furthermore , the large size of the experiment motivated the investigation of two different model reduction strategies : exclusion of the powder-bed from the computational domain and simplified scanning strategies . 
In August 2018 , a demonstration/experiment was performed in Champaign , Illinois USA , at the Engineer Research and Development Center Construction Engineering Research Laboratory ( ERDC-CERL ) looking at the continuous printing of a 512 ft2 ( 47.6 m2 ) reinforced additively constructed concrete ( RACC ) building . 
Previously , in July of 2017 , a more traditional building was 3D printed using a discontinuous concrete printing approach . 
These demonstrations were performed to determine the feasibility of using additively constructed concrete ( ACC ) as a material for vertical structural elements . 
This study explores the differences and similarities of ACC with conventional concrete construction and concrete masonry unit construction . 
To validate the feasibility of ACC a cost comparison analysis was performed comparing the construction methods used in these demonstrations to conventional concrete masonry unit and cast-in-place concrete construction . 
Layered Assembly is a voxel-based additive manufacturing method in which premanufactured voxels serve as the feedstock for producing multi-material parts . 
Electrodes were nominally designed for grasping voxels of 3 × 3 mm cross-section . 
Electrostatic field simulations were performed in COMSOL Multiphysics for both single electrodes , and 2 × 2 electrode arrays . 
The selective gripping capability of the electrode arrays was tested at voltages in the 75–800 V range and applied to both polymer and metallic voxels . 
A comparison of electrode performance in terms of geometry revealed that comb-shaped electrodes were superior , due to ≈100 % reliability when operating in the 600–800 V range . 
Lack-of-fusion flaws can occur in powder bed fusion ( PBF ) additive manufacturing of metal components . 
This paper demonstrates a method for detecting such flaws by monitoring the fabrication of every layer before and after laser scanning with high resolution optical imaging . 
A binary template is created from the sliced 3D model of the part . 
Using this template the optical image data is indexed to the part geometry . 
The indexed image data is used to detect anomalies in the powder layer before laser scanning and in the solidified material after scanning . 
Lack-of-fusion defects are identified from optical data by correlating multiple images with different lighting conditions and from multiple layers . 
Pyrometry showed an increase in intensity in CO2 atmosphere over Ar atmosphere . 
At low levels of reactive gas atmospheres oxygen loss from spatter dominates . 
Oxygen increased in samples from 0.016 wt. 
% in Ar to 0.1 wt. 
% in CO2 . 
Average in-situ particle size in the samples were ∼40 nm . 
There was a 20 % increase in yield strength when samples were produced under CO2 . 
Traditionally , reactive gases such as oxygen ( O2 ) and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) have been avoided during laser powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) of metals and alloys based on the notion that it may lead to defect formation and poor properties . 
Here we show that instead , these gases can be used to form sub-μm-sized oxide particles in-situ during the L-PBF process in an Fe-Cr-Al-Ti stainless steel and lead to improved room temperature and high-temperature mechanical properties . 
We manufactured cube samples using pure Ar and various reactive gas atmospheres , namely an O2/Argon ( Ar ) mixture containing 0.2 % O2 and CO2/Ar mixtures containing up to 100 % CO2 . 
Co-axial measurements of infrared radiation emitted from the melt pool showed correlation to the presence of O2 or CO2 in the gas mixture . 
Builds produced under CO2-containing atmosphere contained complex oxides with an average diameter of ∼40 nm , an Al-rich core and a Ti-rich shell . 
Due to the high cooling rates typical to L-PBF , agglomeration of oxides and slag formation on the surface of the samples could almost be entirely avoided . 
Compression tests at temperatures up to 800 °C showed that the samples produced in 100 % CO2 have about 20 % higher yield stress compared to samples produced in Ar . 
The paper concludes with a discussion of the formation mechanism of the observed oxides . 
Our results show that in-situ reactions during additive manufacturing processes are a promising pathway to the synthesis of particle-reinforced alloys . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes , such as Selective Laser Sintering ( SLS ) , have enabled the fabrication of geometrically complicated designs . 
However , undesired distortions due to thermally-induced residual stresses may lead to loss of tolerance or failure of the part . 
One potential failure mode is buckling , particularly when realizing high aspect ratio features , like for infill , to minimize weight . 
In this paper , we address distortions and part failures due to buckling by using a finite element model to predict residual stress distributions and sintering induced distortions . 
Initially , we conduct a transient thermal simulation to determine the Heat Affected Zone ( HAZ ) , which is then used in the thermomechanical simulation . 
In addition , we imposed perturbations on the mechanical mesh based on the buckling eigenmodes . 
Finally , a thermomechanical viscoplastic analysis was performed layer-by-layer to obtain the final residual stress state and subsequent distortions that occur after cooling down to ambient temperature . 
A model was used to describe the evolution of porosity due to laser sintering , and then a model of the effects of porosity on the viscoplastic constitutive properties of the sintered material was used in the thermomechanical simulation . 
Modeling results are compared against experimental specimens using a Durelli ( aka , Theta ) specimen geometry fabricated with a 3D Systems ProX 200 Selective Laser Sintering ( SLS ) machine . 
The geometry of the specimen represents an internal feature with a high aspect ratio that is prone to buckling , and the dimensions were modified based on the simulation results to confirm the ability of the modeling approach to provide accurate mitigation of buckling-induced distortions . 
This paper presents a process-microstructure finite element modeling framework for predicting the evolution of volumetric phase fractions and microhardness during laser directed energy deposition ( DED ) additive manufacturing of Ti6Al4V . 
Based on recent experimental observations , the present microstructure evolution model is formulated to combine the formation and dissolution kinetics of grain boundary , Widmanstätten colony/basketweave , massive/martensitic alpha and beta phases of Ti6Al4V . 
The microstructure evolution algorithm is verified and embedded into a three-dimensional finite element process simulation model to simulate thermally driven phase transformations during DED processing of a Ti6Al4V thin-walled rectangular sample . 
The simulated volumetric phase fractions and related microhardness distribution agree reasonably well with experimental measurements performed on the sample . 
Thus the proposed simulation model could be useful for designers to understand and control process-microstructure-property relationships in a DED-processed part . 
The present research work has investigated the synthesis of ceramic structures based on inorganic , spherical-hollow microballoons using a binder jet printing process . 
Binder jet printing is a process that allows the synthesis process of complex and intricate parts with minimal waste of the feedstock material . 
The ceramic microballoons here investigated were based on a mullite derivative . 
The printed ceramic parts were cured and sintered as the precursor templates for metal matrix syntactic foams ( MMSFs ) . 
The MMSFs were manufactured by infiltrating the printed ceramic templates by molten aluminum . 
The flexural strength of the cured , sintered , and infiltrated structures were also investigated . 
It is proposed that binder jet printing followed by a sintering and pressureless infiltration process represents an advantageous technology for designing complex MMSF structures . 
The fused coating process is a new material jetting additive manufacturing technology that proposes to solve the problem of high cost , low efficiency and high material requirements of laser-based process and electron beam process . 
The structure and operating principles of the fused coating machine are explained in this paper . 
Sn63Pb37 is taken as the experimental material because of its low melting temperature , small surface tension coefficient and high viscosity . 
Tensile test specimens were made both parallel and perpendicular to the forming trajectory . 
Tensile strengths were measured and the corresponding fractographies were observed . 
It is found that large plastic deformation has occurred before the fracture , and the plasticity of fused components that the tensile direction parallel to the forming trajectory , is higher . 
The densification degree of fused coating component is measured by the drainage method . 
The average value is up to 99.78 % which indicates that the internal structure is indistinguishable from extruded Sn63Pb37 . 
The Vickers hardness of the fused coated component and raw casted material were tested by 5 points respectively , the results showed that the average Vickers hardness of the fused coating component is 14.6 % higher than the casted one . 
Cellular materials , such as foams , can be used as load bearing members in civil construction and as protective energy absorbing structures for personnel and equipment . 
In the present study , novel lightweight closed-cell structures were designed , and their mechanical properties and collapse mechanisms were investigated through a combination of experimental validation and finite element ( FE ) simulations . 
Selected porous structure designs were manufactured from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS ) using additive manufacturing technology . 
These 3D printed structures were subjected to quasi-static loading to determine the dependence of their elastic and plastic responses from their topological features . 
Deformation mechanisms were elucidated through quasi-static compression experiments and FE modelling . 
The appropriate distribution of the base material in the designed closed-cell structures inherits the merits of uniform stress distribution and large deformations that lead to reaching high strengths and desirable energy absorption efficiencies . 
The effects of relative density and cell shape were studied in detail from elastic loading through the large plastic strain densification regions . 
The effects of cellular architecture on deformation mechanisms and energy absorption capabilities demonstrated the possibility of enhancing energy absorption efﬁciencies with appropriate design criteria . 
Based on the experimental and numerical analyses , the most efficient energy absorbing closed-cell structure was proposed . 
The performance enhancement of parts produced using Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) is an important goal for various industrial applications . 
In order to achieve this goal , obtaining a homogeneous microstructure and eliminating material defects within the fabricated parts are important research issues . 
The objective of this experimental study is to evaluate the effect of thermal post-processing of AlSi10Mg parts , using recycled powder , with the aim of improving the microstructure homogeneity of the as-built parts . 
This work is essential for the cost-effective additive manufacturing ( AM ) of metal optics and optomechanical systems . 
To achieve this goal , a full characterization of fresh and recycled powder was performed , in addition to a microstructure assessment of the as-built fabricated samples . 
Annealing , solution heat treatment ( SHT ) and T6 heat treatment ( T6 HT ) were applied under different processing conditions . 
A micro-hardness map was developed to assist in the selection of the optimized post-processing parameters in order to satisfy the design requirements of the part . 
Thermal barrier coatings ( TBC ) are regularly used today to protect and extend the service life of several superalloys which are extensively used in high temperature applications . 
The existing TBCs are typically between 0.1 to 0.5 mm in thickness , are deposited on metal substrates using plasma spray or electron beam vapor deposition , and can reduce temperatures at the substrate surface by up to 300 °C . 
For greater temperature reductions there is a need for thicker TBCs . 
The building of thick TBCs has to date been stymied by poor adhesion , and cracking during deposition . 
It has been suggested that a functionally graded approach may reduce the residual stresses which result in these defects . 
To date there have been few reports on the deposition of ceramic or cermet coatings using laser AM and none have reported on the phase stability of ceramic particles post-deposition . 
This paper is a first report on the phase stability of ceramic particles following the compositional segregation of elements during deposition using a powder feed additive manufacturing process . 
Functionally graded ( FG ) , thick TBCs ( > 3 mm ) consisting of Inconel 625 ( IN625 ) and yttria-partially stabilized zirconia ( 8YSZ ) were deposited on an A516 steel substrate via laser direct energy deposition ( LDED ) . 
Good interfaces were observed between the bond coat ( BC ) and first cermet layer and between the graded cermet layers . 
However , cermet layers deposited with 10 wt. 
% or more YSZ developed a thin layer of YSZ on the surface . 
The thin layer of YSZ greatly hindered additional deposition of new cermet layers . 
In cermet layers that did exhibit good interfaces , fine , re-solidified , YSZ particles were homogenously distributed within the Inconel 625 matrix . 
The YSZ particles exhibited a tetragonal lattice structure and were depleted of yttrium . 
In contrast , the thin YSZ layer formed on a cermet surface showed no yttrium depletion . 
Some of the primary barriers to widespread adoption of metal additive manufacturing ( AM ) are persistent defect formation in built components , high material costs , and lack of consistency in powder feedstock . 
To generate more reliable , complex-shaped metal parts , it is crucial to understand how feedstock properties change with reuse and how that affects build mechanical performance . 
Powder particles interacting with the energy source , yet not consolidated into an AM part can undergo a range of dynamic thermal interactions , resulting in variable particle behavior if reused . 
In this work , we present a systematic study of 316L powder properties from the virgin state through thirty powder reuses in the laser powder bed fusion process . 
Thirteen powder characteristics and the resulting AM build mechanical properties were investigated for both powder states . 
Results show greater variability in part ductility for the virgin state . 
The feedstock exhibited minor changes to size distribution , bulk composition , and hardness with reuse , but significant changes to particle morphology , microstructure , magnetic properties , surface composition , and oxide thickness . 
Additionally , sieved powder , along with resulting fume/condensate and recoil ejecta ( spatter ) properties were characterized . 
It was discovered that spatter leads to formation of single crystal ferrite through large degrees of supercooling and massive solidification . 
Ferrite content and consequently magnetic susceptibility of the powder also increases with reuse , suggesting potential for magnetic separation as a refining technique for altered feedstock . 
Tensile stress in selective laser melted ( SLM ) stainless steel 316 ( SS316 ) bars was studied with neutron imaging methods for measurement of attenuation , scattering , and diffraction . 
The hypotheses for stress failure includes modifications to both the grain structure and residual porosity . 
Neutron Bragg edge imaging showed a change in crystallographic structure and/or texture at a pre-existing fracture , but did not provide evidence for presumptive crack formation . 
A Talbot-Lau grating-based neutron interferometer yielded better than 100 μm spatial resolution for the attenuation images and was tuned to an autocorrelation scattering length of 1.97 μm for the dark-field ( scattering ) images . 
The interferometry imaging was performed with samples parallel and perpendicular to the linear grating , allowing assessment of scattering along and perpendicular to the additive manufacturing build direction . 
In the 3D tomography dark-field volume of a tensile stressed bar , features were observed that suggested possible sites of crack formation . 
The features were quantified with line probes and found to be reproducible over three tomography experiments . 
After imaging , the half-stressed bar was pulled to failure ; the fracture point is correlated with a feature in the line probe having enhanced neutron scattering . 
Neutron interferometry , particularly the dark-field imaging modality , emerges as a powerful non-destructive method for detecting early crack formation in additive manufactured components . 
Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) is a method of joining metal/non-metals or composites layer by layer using different energy sources . 
Among the various AM processes , laser-based powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) is very popular , in which geometrically complex structures can be manufactured directly from CAD models . 
One of the least investigated areas in LPBF is the fatigue property of LPBF produced stainless steel parts , which find a variety of engineering and medical applications . 
In actual service conditions , many engineering components undergo variable cyclic loadings . 
Therefore , in order to widen industrial applications of LPBF process , effects of variable amplitude loading under both zero and tensile mean stresses on the fatigue life of LPBF produced 15-5 precipitation hardened stainless steel parts have been examined in the present study . 
Further , different modes of failure , effects of load sequences on fatigue life and the cumulative damage during the process have also been studied . 
Fracture surfaces were studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy to investigate the mode of failures and completely different fracture surface morphologies for these two cases explain the observed difference in number of cycles to failure with the reversal of the load sequence . 
Recent advances in X-ray computed tomography ( XCT ) have allowed for measurement resolutions approaching the point where XCT can be used for measuring surface topography . 
These advances make XCT appealing for measuring hard-to-reach or internal surfaces , such as those often present in additively manufactured parts . 
To demonstrate the feasibility and potential of XCT for topography measurement , topography datasets obtained using two XCT systems are compared to those acquired using coherence scanning interferometry and focus variation microscopy . 
A hollow Ti6Al4V part produced by laser powder bed fusion is used as a measurement artefact . 
The artefact comprises two component halves that can be separated to expose the internal surfaces . 
Measured surface datasets are accurately aligned and similarly cropped , and compared by various qualitative and quantitative means , including the computation of ISO 25178-2 areal surface texture parameters , commonly used in part quality assessment . 
Results show that XCT can non-destructively provide surface information comparable with more conventional surface measurement technologies , thus representing a viable alternative to more conventional measurement , particularly appealing for hard-to-reach and internal surfaces . 
Low-cost GMAW-based 3-D printing slicing needed for diverse users . 
Upgraded free and open source CuraEngine into MOSTMetalCura . 
New slicer track counts , avoid overlaps , infill to enable continous bead . 
Also includes variable pauses , control of welder and set wire feed . 
The slicer enables 1 mm resolution printing of ER70S-6 steel . 
Low-cost gas metal arc welding ( GMAW ) -based 3-D printing has proven effective at additive manufacturing steel and aluminum parts . 
To enable automated slicing a 3-D model and generating G-code for an acceptable path for GMAW 3-D printing , this paper reports on upgrading of the free and open source CuraEngine . 
The new slicer , MOSTMetalCura , provides the following novel abilities necessary for GMAW 3-D printing : i ) change the perimeter metric from width to track count , ii ) avoid movement that overlaps previous weld beads , iii ) have infill start immediately after the perimeter finished and in the direction that eliminates translations , iv ) add a variable pause between layers to allow for substrate cooling , v ) configure GPIO pins to turn on/off the welder , and vi ) set optimized wire feed speed and voltage of the welder based on printing speed , layer height , filament diameter , and tool track width . 
The process for initiating these changes are detailed and the new slicer is used to help improve the function of the printer for ER70S-6 steel . 
To find the printing function with the smallest bead width based on volume of material , the line width , layer height , and printing speed are varied to provide wire feed speed calculated by MOSTMetalCura , then the settings are used to print 3-D models . 
The results of 3-D printing three case study objects of increasing geometric complexity using the process methodology improvements presented , which show resolution of 1 mm bead widths . 
In the current study , cylindrical samples of AlSi10Mg alloy were fabricated using direct metal laser sintering ( DMLS ) technique in vertical and horizontal directions . 
The microstructure of the samples was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy , electron backscatter diffraction and transmission electron microscopy . 
It was observed that , by changing the building direction from vertical to horizontal , columnar to equiaxed transition ( CET ) occurred in the alloy . 
While 75 % of the grains in the vertical sample were columnar , by changing the direction to horizontal , 49 % of the grains evolved with columnar shape and 51 % of them were equiaxed . 
Moreover , the texture of DMLS-AlSi10Mg alloy changed due to CET . 
While { 001 } fiber texture evolved in the vertical sample , the < 001 > direction tilted away from the building direction in the horizontal one . 
Using the fundamentals of solidification and constitutional undercooling , the solidification behavior of AlSi10Mg alloy during DMLS process was modeled . 
It was observed that , the determinant parameter in CET during DMLS of AlSi10Mg alloy is the angle between the nominal growth rate and < hkl > direction of the growing dendrite , which is controlled by the geometry and building direction of the sample . 
Further TEM studies confirmed that , CET alters the shape and coherency of Si precipitates and dislocation density inside the α-Al dendrites in DMLS-AlSi10Mg alloy . 
Metal additive manufacturing , despite of offering unique capabilities e.g . 
unlimited design freedom , short manufacturing time , etc. 
, suffers from raft of intrinsic defects . 
Porosity is of the defects which can badly deteriorate a part ’ s performance . 
To this end , in this work a combined numerical and experimental approach has been used to analyze the formation , evolution and disappearance of keyhole and keyhole-induced porosities along with their initiating mechanisms , during single track L-PBF of a Ti6Al4V alloy . 
In this respect , a high-fidelity numerical model based on the Finite Volume Method ( FVM ) and accomplished in the commercial software Flow-3D is developed . 
The model accounts for the major physics taking place during the laser-scanning step of the L-PBF process . 
The results show that during the keyhole regime , the heating rises dramatically compared to the shallow-depth melt pool regime due to the large entrapment of laser rays in the keyhole cavities . 
Also a detailed parametric study is performed to investigate the effect of input power on thermal absorptivity , heat transfer and melt pool anatomy . 
Furthermore , an X-ray Computed Tomography ( X-CT ) analysis is carried out to visualize the pores formed during the L-PBF process . 
It is shown , that the predicted shape , size and depth of the pores are in very good agreement with those found by either X-CT or optical and 3D digital microscopic images . 
Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) is a metal additive manufacturing process where parts are fabricated from metal powder based on CAD data . 
Selection of the best process parameters for the pulsed SLM processes is a fundamental problem due to the increased number of parameters that have a direct impact on the melt pool compared to the continuous SLM processes . 
In previous studies , volumetric energy density or scan speed have been used as control variables for applied energy . 
In this paper , the process parameters ( laser power , exposure time , point distance and hatching distance ) were considered individually , in addition to particle size distribution and layer thickness . 
The Taguchi experimental design method was used to determine and optimise the effect of the selected input parameters . 
The effect of exposure time and its correlation with layer thickness and particle size distribution was then investigated . 
The results show the best combination of process parameters which can provide fully or near fully dense parts . 
The results also show the minimum exposure time that can be used with different powder types and layer thicknesses . 
The paper concludes with a study which shows the part location has a significant impact on sample quality . 
X-ray microtomography can be used to characterise objects undergoing fabrication by additive manufacturing . 
During the layer-by-layer building process , it can provide key information about geometry , roughness and it can even reveal typical defects such as lack-of-fusion porosity , gas pores or cracks . 
In the present work , we describe our custom-designed additive manufacturing chamber allowing in situ 3D-non-destructive characterisation to be performed during layer-by-layer construction using synchrotron X-ray microtomography . 
Scans before ( subsequently to powder deposition ) and after local laser melting are acquired for every layer . 
Among the most popular additive manufacturing processes for metals , Powder bed fusion technology involves a layer by layer manufacturing approach utilizing a high power source , such as a laser or an electron beam , interacting with the metal powder on selected surfaces . 
Beam-powder interaction brings up a handful of phenomena affecting the quality of the final part in its volume and surface . 
In this study , different surface features generated by Selective Laser Melting of an Al-Si7-Mg alloy are investigated and interpreted based on their morphology , microstructure and hardness to improve the general understanding of defect genesis . 
Ballings , spatter particles and partially melted metal powders are distinguished by their morphology , size and microstructure . 
It is shown that these differences arise from different cooling rates during their generation . 
Ballings share the same microstructure with the bulk material both experiencing cooling in conduction mode . 
Spatters and partially melted powders show coarser microstructure driven by solidification mainly ruled by convection and radiation during their flight in the inert atmosphere of the process chamber . 
Long production times , the associated high costs of the products and product size limitations belong among current issues of selective laser melting ( SLM ) technology . 
Hybrid products containing small and complex-shaped parts deposited by SLM on the forged , rolled or hot stamped semi-products could offer a practical solution to these limitations . 
Cylindrical hybrid parts were additively manufactured by depositing 18Ni300 maraging steel on the cylindrical semi-products of CMnAlNb low-alloy advanced high strength steel ( AHSS ) . 
The AHSS was used either in forged and air cooled condition or after heat treatments typically used for inducing the TRIP ( transformation induced plasticity ) effect . 
Various post-build heat treatments of the hybrid parts were performed . 
The mechanical properties of the hybrid parts were determined by hardness measurement across the interface and by a tensile test of the dissimilar joints . 
All tensile samples fractured in the high-strength steel side , several millimetres from the interface . 
Microstructure analysis of both materials and the interface region was carried out using light and scanning electron microscopes . 
The hybrid parts had the ultimate tensile strengths of 840−940 MPa , with total elongations of 12–19 % . 
The best combination of tensile strength and elongation was obtained with two-step heat treatment of the TRIP steel prior to additive manufacturing with no post-build heat treatment of the hybrid part . 
In this paper , the potential of selective laser melting ( SLM ) of stainless steel CL 20ES powder was investigated with a focus on controlled fabrication of porous structures with strongly reduced pore sizes , i.e . 
feature sizes significantly below conventional minimum SLM feature sizes . 
By controlling laser scan properties interacting with the powder bed directly , porous structures can be generated by selectively sintering powder particles . 
A wide range of porous samples was manufactured following this strategy , aiming to increase porosity while keeping pore sizes low . 
The effect of process parameters , including laser power and focal point positioning , was evaluated for a fibre laser operated in pulsed wave ( PW ) emission mode . 
The first part of this study focuses on characterization of key porous structure properties , i.e. 
, porosity , average mass density , average pore sizes and structures at microscopic scales . 
The second part deals with the influence of porosity and pore sizes on thermal and fluid properties , i.e. 
, the effective thermal conductivity ( ETC ) and wettability . 
We have quantified the directional dependence ( build direction plane and scan direction plane ) off the structural and thermophysical properties of porous structures . 
For a range of porosities and pore sizes , we have observed that porosity and surface morphology influence the thermal properties and contact angle of droplets on the printed surface . 
Thermal conductivity was measured and the associated analysis was compared with available models and correlations in literature . 
The average thermal conductivity of fabricated porous structures was determined between 6-14 W/m·K and found to be a function of porosity . 
Furthermore , the capillary wicking performance of additively manufactured stainless steel porous structures having an average pore radius from 9 to 23 µm was determined . 
Typically , additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes are limited to a single material per build while many products benefit from the integration of multiple materials with varied properties . 
To achieve the benefits of multiple materials , the geometric freedom of AM could be used to build internal structures that emulate a range of different material properties such as stiffness , Poisson ’ s ratio , and elastic limit using only a single build material . 
This paper examines a wide range of properties that can be achieved using diamond lattice structures manufactured from Nylon 12 with a commercial laser sintering ( LS ) process . 
Stiffness and energy absorption were measured for all lattices and the stiffness response was compared to finite element analysis ( FEA ) . 
Simulation shows agreement with experimental results over a stiffness range of four orders of magnitude once a correction factor is applied . 
Experimental results also show a wide range of energy absorption for diamond lattice structures and a significant increase in the effective elastic limit of the build material , which compensates for the low ductility of many AM materials . 
The elastic limit decreases with an increasing t/L ratio meanwhile the degradation under cyclic loading is relatively independent of the t/L ratio . 
Extrapolating this data into lattice structures made from metal , these same structures could mimic a wide range of “ fully ” dense and porous materials with just the use of a single material . 
Since the diamond lattice is a cellular structure , the voids can also be filled with other materials or structures to add secondary control of embedded functions such as energy storage and sensing . 
Laser wire deposits using Alloy 625 modified with 0.4 wt % B were manufactured on stainless steel 304 substrates . 
A layer boundary with a thickness of around 250 μm was formed between the layer cores during deposition . 
Results show that the solidification features in the layer boundary were coarser than the layer core due to the recalescence mechanism . 
Continuous eutectics were observed segregating the inter-dendritic regions in both the layer boundary and the layer core . 
The eutectics consisted of mainly Laves phase with a small amount of NbC precipitates . 
Solidification front velocities ( SFV ) were calculated from the Kurz-Giovanola-Trivedi ( KGT ) model . 
Results showed that they developed in the layer boundary and in the layer core at 0.06 m/s and 0.1 m/s respectively . 
Electron backscattered diffraction ( EBSD ) mapping revealed that small equiaxed grains nucleated in the layer boundary , while large columnar grains were prevalent in the layer core . 
The columnar to equiaxed transition ( CET ) model developed by Hunts was considered and the results were in good agreement with the observed grain morphologies . 
Metallization has been widely used to enhance the aesthetics and performance of injection molded plastic parts , but the techniques have not been widely extended to 3D printed parts due to intrinsic differences in surface chemistry and morphology . 
Here , we investigate direct metallization of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS ) 3D printed thermoplastic parts using low cost environmentally benign surface preparations and physical vapor deposition ( PVD ) to avoid the use of preparation with toxic chromic acid . 
Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR ) spectra are gathered for each surface preparation method prior to metallization . 
The metallized parts are then characterized for thin film adhesion , electrical resistivity , and optical reflectivity . 
Additionally , each part is imaged using a scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) post-metallization . 
The results show that surface preparation with solvent results in a smooth and aesthetically pleasing surface , but metallic film adhesion is poor . 
Conversely , when 2000 grit sandpaper is used to mechanically prepare the surfaces , the resulting films have poor electrical conductivity and optical reflectance , but excellent adhesion . 
Atmospheric plasma treatment of the parts results in the highest overall performance , with superior adhesion strength and optical reflectivity and low electrical resistivity . 
Electron microscopy and FTIR reveal that the high adhesion resulting from atmospheric plasma is caused by modification surface morphology , but not surface chemical termination . 
The results indicate that direct metallization of 3D printed ABS is a viable method for creating metallized parts with high performance and an aesthetically pleasing appearance and that the use of chromic acid in surface preparation is not necessary . 
The development and growth of additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes have made the optimization of surface quality and properties of AM components critical . 
Laser polishing represents a recent and novel application of laser surface irradiation that can be used for precise , post-process smoothing of the rough surfaces commonly encountered on AM parts . 
Austenitic stainless steels are an important class of alloys frequently used in biomedical applications due to their corrosion resistance . 
Due to this , corrosion resistance advancements and improved bio-response to stainless steels are long-term active areas of research . 
In this study , the influence of laser polishing on surface modification and corrosion behavior of additively manufactured 316L has been investigated . 
Laser scanning speed and number of passes were varied to evaluate their effect on the surface quality and corrosion resistance of the experimental samples . 
The results indicated that laser polishing could enable reductions in surface roughness of over 92 % ( from 4.75 μm to 0.49 μm Sa ) while also incorporating partially melted powders originally on the as-printed surface layer . 
The X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) results indicated that there was no considerable phase change after laser polishing . 
Laser polishing was observed to refine the columnar structure within the as-printed sample into a fine cellular structure . 
Additionally , the sub-surface microhardness of the laser remelted layer increased from 1.82 GPa to 2.89 GPa . 
Moreover , the laser polished samples exhibited greater corrosion resistance , which was believed to be due to a combination of a decrease in surface roughness and grain refinement . 
These results show that laser polishing can improve the corrosion resistance of additive manufactured stainless steel while also decreasing surface roughness and increasing surface microhardness . 
Due to those enhancements , it represents a suitable multifaceted process for finishing additive manufactured parts . 
When it is difficult to deposit a material A on a material B , it is possible to create a Functionally Graded Material ( FGM ) using a buffer material between them to avoid the appearance of defects . 
The literature shows that it is very difficult , nay impossible , to have an efficient metallurgical bond between Ti6Al4V and Inconel-Mo alloys without cracks , porosities or delamination . 
Moreover , the understanding of the phenomena taking place at the interface allows the preservation of the structural integrity of a FGM made by additive manufacturing . 
CLAD® powder-based directed energy deposition allows the building of parts containing FGM and/or buffer materials directly during the process . 
In this paper , the first interface 100 Ti6Al4V / 25 Ti6Al4V – 75 Mo ( in wt % ) is smooth , suggesting that there has been diffusion between both alloys . 
The second one , 25 Ti6Al4V – 75 Mo / 30 Inconel 718 – 70 Mo , contains numerous exotic structures between both alloys . 
Thus , EDS , TKD and X-ray crystallography were performed right on this interface and revealed three main structures : a hexagonal matrix , a cubic structure and an ordered hexagonal one . 
The hexagonal matrix appears to consist of Ni3Ti and the ordered hexagonal one of NiMo . 
Ultrasonic welding is a solid-state joining process which uses ultrasonic vibration to join materials at relatively low temperatures . 
Ultrasonic powder consolidation is a derivative of the ultrasonic additive process which consolidates powder material into a dense solid block without melting . 
During ultrasonic powder consolidation process , metal powder under a compressive load is subjected to transverse ultrasonic vibrations resulting in a fully-dense consolidated product . 
While ultrasonic powder consolidation process is employed in a wide variety of manufacturing processes , bonding mechanism of powder particles during the consolidation process is not clearly understood . 
This study uses a coupled thermo-mechanical finite element analysis technique to understand the underlying bonding mechanism involved in ultrasonic powder consolidation process . 
The study also investigates the effect of critical process parameters including vibrational amplitude and base temperature on the stress , strain , and particle temperature distribution during this process . 
Based on the results of the simulation , a possible theory on the bonding mechanism involved in ultrasonic powder consolidation process is proposed . 
The outcomes of this study can be used to further the industrial applications of ultrasonic powder consolidation process as well as other ultrasonic welding based processes . 
Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) has significantly increased the design freedom available for metal parts and provides significant flexibility within each build to produce multiple components of varying size and shape . 
In order to obtain the highest build efficiency , it is ideal to print multiple parts together spanning the entire plate with as little spacing as possible between the parts . 
Work has been performed to characterize the variance of materials properties as a function of location within the build volume as well as component density on the build plate . 
This work utilizes mechanical , chemical , and microstructural analysis techniques to expand on previous work by statistically evaluating the impact of build location , and nearest neighbor proximity on tensile performance in Electron Beam Melted ( EBM ) Ti-6Al-4 V. Mechanical results are then correlated to structural phenomenon and the effectiveness of various strengthening mechanisms are determined . 
Results show that properties span a small range regardless of build design and that interstitial strengthening and lath spacing are the driving factors for mechanical strength . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) technologies are used in three dimensional ( 3D ) printing of parts using thermo-plastic extruders , or laser and electron beam based metal deposition methods . 
This paper presents an integrated methodology for planning of tangential path velocity , material deposition rate and temperature control of the extruded material which is deposited along curved paths . 
The tangential velocity along the path is smoothed and optimized while respecting the heater ’ s and extruder ’ s capacities , as well as the feed drives ’ jerk , acceleration and velocity limits . 
The extrusion rate is controlled proportional to the tangential path velocity while keeping the temperature of the deposited thermo-plastic material at the desired temperature by adaptively controlling current supply to the heater . 
The experimentally proven algorithm leads to more uniform material deposition at sharp curvatures and resulting improved dimensional accuracy of printed parts . 
The proposed methodology can be extended to laser and electron beam based metal printing applications . 
Directed energy deposition ( DED ) processes frequently rely on metallic powder and wire feedstock materials . 
Several grades of metallic strips are , however , commercially available but not yet largely utilized in DED . 
This paper introduces a newly developed laser strip cladding process , which can be used for surfacing , repair and additive manufacturing . 
Cladding tests consisted of single-layer single- and multi-bead tests on planar and round bar type base materials using a 30 mm wide solid Alloy 625 strip . 
The results showed that with 8 kW laser power 34 mm wide and ˜2 mm thick single beads on steel could be produced with low dilution and fusion bond with high deposition ( 8 kg/h ) rates . 
Corrosion performance of clad deposit was influenced by the inhomogeneous distribution of intermixed iron from the base material on a test surface . 
In addition to high productivity , the developed process takes advantage of large build volume ( > 1 m3 ) and full material utilization as well as clean process conditions . 
Additive manufacturing has the potential to revolutionize the production of metallic components as it yields near net shape parts with complex geometries and minimizes waste . 
At the present day , additively manufactured components face qualification and certification challenges due to the difficulty in controlling defects . 
This has driven a significant research effort aimed at better understanding and improving processing controls – yielding a plethora of in-situ measurements aimed at correlating defects with material quality metrics of interest . 
In this work , we develop machine-learning methods to learn correlations between thermal history and subsurface porosity for a variety of print conditions in laser powder bed fusion . 
Un-normalized surface temperatures ( in the form of black-body radiances ) are obtained using high-speed infrared imaging and porosity formation is observed in the sample cross-section through synchrotron x-ray imaging . 
To demonstrate the predictive power of these features , we present four statistical machine-learning models that correlate temperature histories to subsurface porosity formation in laser fused Ti-6Al-4V powder . 
The aircraft engine industry manufactures many ring-like metal parts of large diameter but small cross-sectional area . 
Designers of these parts require increasingly complex geometries for improved aerodynamic efficiency and cooling while manufacturers of these parts require larger and faster equipment for high productivity and low cost . 
The combination of these industrial requirements inspired the development of a new Direct Metal Laser Melting ( DMLM ) architecture , reported here , which incorporates a rotating powder bed . 
The system coordinates the rotational motion of the powder bed with an ascending laser scanner and recoater to build parts in a helical fashion . 
A single-point powder feeder delivers metal powder near the inner radius of an annular build volume , and a recoater spreads the powder to the outer radius in a “ snow plow ” fashion . 
Encoder feedback from both the rotational stage and the galvanometers assures accuracy of the laser scan path . 
Build rates were shown to triple conventional DMLM systems while powder requirements were decreased by more than 4x . 
The production of magnesium alloy WE43 was achieved by selective laser melting ( SLM ) . 
The alloy was investigated after SLM , hot isostatic pressing ( HIP ) , and solutionising heat treatment . 
The microstructure and corrosion behaviour of the specimens were carefully characterised , whilst assessed and contrast relative to the conventionally cast alloy counterpart . 
The SLM prepared specimens possess a unique microstructure comprising fine grains growing with a strong [ 0001 ] texture along the building direction with a low fraction of process-induced and metallurgical defects , reaching < 0.1 % , after optimising the SLM parameters and the HIP treatment . 
Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the SLM prepared WE43 is cathodically more active as compared with its cast counterpart . 
It is proposed that this behaviour is due to a high density of zirconium-rich oxide particles uniformly distributed throughout the alloy microstructure as well as the alterations in the chemical composition of the solid-solution matrix originating from the high cooling rates of SLM . 
It was also noted that the oxide particles are mainly sourced by powder . 
The present results suggest that the corrosion of SLM prepared Mg alloys could be greatly improved once the influence of powder characteristics is further understood and controlled . 
A three-dimensional ( 3D ) thermomechanical coupled model for Laser Solid Forming ( LSF ) of Ti-6Al-4V alloy has been calibrated through experiments of 40-layers metal deposition using different scanning strategies . 
The sensitivity analysis of the mechanical parameters shows that the thermal expansion coefficient as well as the elastic limit of Ti-6Al-4V have a great impact on the mechanical behavior . 
Using the validated model and optimal mechanical parameters , the evolution of thermo-mechanical fields in LSF has been analyzed . 
It has been found that the stresses and distortions develop in two stages , after the deposition of the first layer and during the cooling phase after the manufacturing of the component . 
The cooling phase is the responsible of 70 % of the residual stresses and 60 % of the total distortions . 
The analyses indicate that by controlling the initial substrate temperature ( pre-heating phase ) and the final cooling phase it is possible to mitigate both distortion and residual stresses . 
The results show that increasing the pre-heating temperature of the substrate is the most effective way to reduce the distortions and residual stresses in Additive Manufacturing . 
A novel method that combines additive manufacturing ( AM ) and atomic layer deposition ( ALD ) . 
Space-grading plastic AM components enables faster and more complex designs . 
The ALD coating seems to improve the flow properties of the tested AM fluidics restrictor . 
Results also indicate an improved structural integrity . 
There were indications the coating might slightly mitigate outgassing at higher temperatures , but results are inconclusive . 
Space technology has been an early adopter of additive manufacturing ( AM ) as a way of quickly producing relatively complex systems and components that would otherwise require expensive and custom design and production . 
Space as an environment and long-term survivability pose challenges to materials used in AM and these challenges need to be addressed . 
Atomic layer deposition ( ALD ) is an effective coating method enabling conformal and precise coating of the complete AM print . 
This work analyses how an ALD coating of aluminium oxide on acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS ) and polyamide PA 2200 plastic AM prints benefits and protects them . 
AM was performed with material extrusion and selective laser sintering methods that are commonly used . 
Tests were performed with a simple bang-bang controller test setup and a mass spectrometer , and the existence of the coating was confirmed with scanning electron microscope imaging . 
First known study on design freedom offered by 3D Sand-Printing process to redesign sprue in metal casting which causes agitation in melt flow . 
Numerical model and optimization algorithm for novel sprue profiles are developed to reduce casting defects by 99.5 % . 
Mechanical strength in castings improved by 8.4 % when compared to traditional gating . 
The opportunity to improve the quality of metal castings by enabling fabrication of complex gating systems via 3D Sand-Printing ( 3DSP ) has been recently established . 
Among the different components of a gating system ( often called rigging ) , sprue design offers a major opportunity to exploit the unlimited geometric freedom offered by 3DSP process . 
In this study , conventional principles of casting hydrodynamics is advanced by validated novel numerical models for novel sprue designs to improve melt flow control . 
Multiple approaches to integrate 3DSP into conventional manufacturing to fabricate complex gating systems through “ Hybrid Molding ” are presented . 
3DSP molds featuring two optimized sprue profiles and a benchmark straight sprue are fabricated to pour 17-4 stainless steel . 
Computed tomography scans ( CT ) shows that parabolic sprue casting ( PSC ) and conical-helix sprue casting ( CHSC ) reduced overall casting defects by 56 % and 99.5 % respectively when compared to straight sprue casting ( SSC ) . 
Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) analysis confirms the presence of globular oxide inclusions and that PSC and CHSC exhibits 21 % and 35 % reduced inclusion when compared to the SSC . 
Three point flexural testing reveals that CHSC and PSC exhibits an increase of 8.4 % and 4.1 % respectively in average ultimate flexural strength than SSC . 
The findings from this study demonstrate that numerically optimized gating systems that can only be fabricated via 3DSP have the potential to significantly improve both mechanical and metallurgical performance of sand castings . 
With increasing industrial application of additive manufacturing technologies , such as selective laser melting , the requirements concerning the processes ’ capabilities like productivity , robustness , part quality and the range of processable materials are increasing as well . 
But due to high cooling rates , high thermal gradients and a layer-wise processing , parts produced by selective laser melting are subject to different kinds of defects . 
These defects commonly lead to high porosity , distortion , cracking and rough surfaces . 
But when a second beam is used to heat the vicinity of the melt pool a homogenization of the temperature field , a reduction of the cooling speeds within the melt pool and in its vicinity as well as an improved wetting behavior is possible . 
A proof of concept is shown , discussing general trends and possibilities , like increased surface qualities or dense microstructures with low amounts of remelting , when these strategies are elaborated . 
Binder jet printed components typically have low overall density in the green state and high shrinkage and deformation after heat treatment . 
It has previously been demonstrated that , by including nanoparticles of the same material in the binder , these properties can be improved as the nanoparticles can fill the interstices and pore throats between the bed particles . 
The beneficial effects from using these additive binder particles can be improved by maximising the binder particle size , enabling the space within the powder bed to be filled with a higher packing efficiency . 
The selection of maximum particle size for a binder requires detailed knowledge of the pores and pore throats between the powder bed particles . 
In this paper , a raindrop model is used to determine the critical radius at which binder particles can pass between pores and penetrate the bed . 
The model is validated against helium psychometry measurements and binder particle drop tests . 
It is found that the critical radius can be predicted , with acceptable accuracy , using a linear function of the mean and standard deviation of the particle radii . 
Percolation theory concepts have been employed in order to generalise the results for powder beds that have different mean particle sizes and size distributions . 
The results of this work can be employed to inform the selection of particle sizes required for binder formulations , to optimise density and reduce shrinkage in printed binder jet components . 
Electron beam melting ( EBM ) is a metal powder bed fusion additive manufacturing ( AM ) technology that makes possible the fabrication of three-dimensional near-net-shaped parts directly from computer models . 
EBM technology has been continuously evolving , optimizing the properties and the microstructure of the as-fabricated alloys . 
Ti-6Al-4V ELI ( Extra Low Interstitials ) titanium alloy is the most widely used and studied alloy for this technology and is the focus of this work . 
Several research works have been completed to study the mechanisms of microstructure formation , evolution , and its subsequent influence on mechanical properties of the alloy . 
In this work , samples fabricated at different locations , orientations , and distances from the build platform have been characterized , studying the relationship of these variables with the resulting material intrinsic characteristics and properties ( surface topography , microstructure , porosity , micro-hardness and static mechanical properties ) . 
This study has revealed that porosity is the main factor controlling mechanical properties relative to the other studied variables . 
Therefore , in future process development , decreasing the porosity should be considered the primary goal in order to improve mechanical properties . 
In the rapidly growing field of Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) , the Laser Directed Energy Deposition ( L-DED ) process is the focus of intense technical attention due to its potential to generate high quality components with location specific composition and microstructural control . 
Despite the variety of experimental and modelling efforts devoted to the subject , no studies directly observe the interactions between individual powder particles and the liquid pool of metal at a high enough temporal frequency to characterize these discrete contact events . 
Video images reveal that particles often impact and float on the surface of the melt pool for several hundreds of microseconds before melting into it . 
Further incoming particles were observed to rebound from the melt pool by these floating particles . 
Through modelling this process analytically , particle self-shielding is shown to impose unavoidable upper limits on overall powder capture efficiency for the L-DED process . 
High entropy alloy AlCoCrFeNi was obtained by selective electron beam melting ( SEBM ) . 
The mechanical properties of SEBM specimens were improved compared with those of the cast specimen . 
The pitting potential of the AlCoCrFeNi SEBM specimens in artificial seawater was slightly lower than that of the cast specimen . 
The properties of the product were influenced by the microstructure evolution in the SEBM process . 
Additive manufacturing is expected to be the manufacturing method for components made with high-entropy alloys ( HEAs ) . 
In this study , the mechanical and electrochemical behaviors were investigated for equi-molar HEA ( AlCoCrFeNi ) obtained with selective electron beam melting ( SEBM ) . 
The mechanical properties of SEBM products were improved compared with those of a cast specimen . 
Electrochemical measurements in artificial seawater revealed the corrosion behaviors of HEA ( AlCoCrFeNi ) . 
The pitting potential of SEBM specimens ( 0.112 V vs. Ag/AgCl ) was lower than that of a cast specimen ( 0.178 V vs. Ag/AgCl ) . 
The mechanical and electrochemical properties of SEBM products were influenced by the phase morphologies formed during the SEBM process . 
This paper aims to understand the formation and the effect of residual stress on selective laser melting ( SLM ) parts . 
SLM is a powder bed based additive manufacturing ( AM ) process and can be compared to a laser welding process . 
Due to the high temperature gradients and the densification ratio , which are characteristic of this process , residual stresses occur . 
The investigation of residual stress is performed using X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) for samples made of austenitic stainless steel AISI 316L ( EN 1.4404 ) . 
This research examines residual stress at different depths and at two outer surfaces . 
For the measurement of stresses at different depths , the samples ’ surface layers were removed by electropolishing . 
At sufficiently large distances from the top surface , the stresses in the area of the edge layer initially increase strongly and then decline again . 
The value and orientation of the resulting main stress components are dependent on the examined layer . 
At the top surface , the residual stresses are higher in scan direction than in perpendicular direction . 
In contrast , at the lateral surface the maximum main stress is perpendicular to the scan and parallel to the building direction . 
These two cases can be described very well by the two mechanisms in SLM , namely the temperature gradient mechanism ( TGM ) and the cool-down phase . 
It is also shown that at samples with a relative structural density of > 99 % , the residual stress values are independent of the applied energy density . 
The rheology of a ceramic paste is known to be a key factor in the process of additive manufacturing of ceramic parts via extrusion freeforming . 
The rheological properties of ceramic pastes can be influenced by several formulation parameters . 
In this study , the mutual influence between formulation parameters , printing properties and mechanical properties of ceramic pastes ( Al2O3 ) and the resulting green bodies are investigated . 
Special focus is set on elucidating the origins and causes of the altered paste properties to allow targeted material development of pastes for the use in extrusion freeforming . 
Glycerine and nanoparticulate boehmite needles are tested as additives and they successfully improve the printability in the extrusion freeforming process of the paste and compression strength of the green body . 
Considerable difference in the dependency of the mechanical properties on the formulation parameters was detected after a partial sintering of the green bodies at 1000 °C . 
Dewatering , shrinkage during drying and a running of the deposited lines could be reduced successfully by adjusting the formulation . 
The impact of the formulation parameters on the printing performance could be linked to the dependency of the volume flow rate on the ratio of pressure over viscosity . 
Hollow microlattices constitute a model topology for architected materials , as they combine excellent specific stiffness and strength with relative ease of manufacturing . 
The most scalable manufacturing technique to date encompasses fabrication of a sacrificial polymeric template by the Self Propagating Photopolymer Waveguide ( SPPW ) process , followed by thin film coating and removal of the substrate . 
Accurate modeling of mechanical properties ( e.g. 
, stiffness , strength ) of hollow microlattices is challenging , primarily due to the complex stress state around the hollow nodes and the existence of manufacturing-induced geometric imperfections ( e.g . 
In this work , we use a variety of measuring techniques ( SEM imaging , CT scanning , etc . ) 
to characterize the geometric imperfections in a nickel-based ultralight hollow microlattice and investigate their effect on the compressive strength of the lattice . 
At the strut level , where a more quantitative description of geometric defects is available , the gathered data is used to build a stochastic field model of geometric imperfections using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition . 
Using Monte Carlo simulations , the critical buckling loads of a large set of imperfect bars created using the stochastic model are then extracted by Finite Elements Analysis . 
The statistics of the buckling strength in artificially generated bars is then used to explain the scatter in the strength of CT-derived bars and its correlation with the lattice strength measured experimentally . 
Although the quantitative results are specific to microlattices fabricated by SPPW templating , the methodology presented herein is equally applicable to architected materials produced by other manufacturing processes . 
In order to study the special constriction effect and physical process features during compulsively constricted WAAM ( CC-WAAM ) , the dynamic behaviours of arc , droplets , and molten pool were visually investigated . 
Possible interactions inside the narrow space were discussed to explain the mechanism of the compulsive constriction on ejected plasma and droplets . 
Based on the captured images , the strong radiative emission indicates that the ejected plasma was at high temperature at least 6000 K. As the current increases higher-temperature plasma jets were expected , which would lead to a larger plasma volume in the absence of constriction . 
The relationship between current and droplet diameters was preliminarily established to enable prediction of the droplet size . 
An important feature of small-size droplets ( as low as 0.89 mm ) offered CC-WAAM a great potential to improve the precision of the additive manufacturing layers , although the minimum width of the deposited layer is much larger than the droplet diameter due to liquid spreading and accumulation . 
The droplets were found to have a slight impact on the molten pool behaviours , which produces stable molten pool shapes . 
Under the wide-range parameters , the deposited layers showed good appearances , which indicates the good adaptability of this novel technology . 
In this study , laser metal deposition ( LMD ) was employed to explore a new fabrication process for producing a functionally graded material ( FGM ) from Ti-6Al-4V to SS316 . 
A transition composition route was introduced ( Ti-6Al-4V→V→Cr→Fe→SS316 ) to avoid the intermetallic phases between Ti-6Al-4V and SS316 . 
A thin wall sample was fabricated via LMD by following the transition composition route . 
Microstructure characterization and composition distribution analyses were performed by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and energy dispersive spectrometry ( EDS ) . 
The SEM images depicted the microstructural morphology of the FGM sample . 
The element gradient distribution determined by the EDS results may reflect the FGM transition composition route design . 
X-ray diffraction tests were conducted and the results demonstrated that the generation of intermetallic phases effectively avoided following the composition route . 
The Vickers hardness test was used to determine the Vickers hardness number ( VHN ) distribution from Ti-6Al-4V to SS316 . 
The VHN results showed that no significant formation of hard brittle phases occurred in the LMD procedure . 
Combining metal nanoparticle ( NP ) printing and additive manufacturing has high potential for integration of 3D conductive elements and electronic devices inside objects . 
Current processes used to achieve desired electrical resistivity of the printed NP circuits entail a compromise between resistivity , throughput , and thermal damage of the structure . 
We explore the mechanisms underlying the combination of Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene ( ABS ) and Polylactide ( PLA ) polymer structures , printing of silver NPs ( mixed nanowires and nanospheres ) , and out-of-chamber Intense Pulsed Light ( IPL ) sintering of the printed circuits . 
IPL of only-nanosphere based circuits on the FFF-made structure thermally damages the polymer without any resistivity reduction . 
In a significant advance , the addition of nanowires achieves a resistivity several times lesser than the state-of-the-art ( 13.1 μΩ-cm or 8 x bulk silver ) without any thermal damage and within 0.75 s of IPL . 
Electromagnetic analysis and Molecular Dynamics simulations show that nanowire addition concurrently reduces IPL temperature and accelerates the kinetics of resistivity reduction . 
Subsequent FFF over the post-IPL conductive pattern causes a non-monotonic change in resistivity , surprisingly effecting a resistivity reduction down to 11.8 μΩ-cm . 
The developed approach is used to demonstrate multilayer sensing of internal temperature and a light sensing circuit with embedded interconnects . 
Finally , we discuss how these insights may guide the creation of a machine tool that creates a seamless form of the proposed process . 
Parts fabricated using additive manufacturing ( AM ) methods , such as laser-powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) , receive highly localized heat fluxes from a laser within a purged , inert environment during manufacture . 
These heat fluxes are used for melting metal powder feedstock , while remaining energy is transferred to the solidified part and adjoining gas environment . 
Using computational fluid dynamics ( CFD ) , the local heat transfer between the adjoining shielding gas , laser-induced melt pool and surrounding heat affected zone is estimated . 
Simulations are performed for the L-PBF of a single layer of Ti-6Al-4 V. Local temperature , temperature gradients , temperature time-rates-of-change ( including cooling rates ) , as well as dimensionless numbers descriptive of important thermophysics , are provided in order to quantify local convective heat transfer for various laser/gas motion directions . 
Results demonstrate that L-PBF track heat transfer is highly dependent on relative gas/laser direction which can impact the prior β grain sizes in Ti-6Al-4 V material by up to 10 % . 
It is found that when the laser and gas are moving in the same direction , convection heat transfer is the highest and a ‘ leading thermal boundary layer ’ exists in front of the laser which is capable of preheating downstream powder for a possible reduction in residual stress formation along the track . 
Presented results can aid ongoing L-PBF modeling efforts and assist manufacturing design decisions ( e.g . 
scan strategy , laser power , scanning speed , etc . ) 
– especially for cases where homogeneous or controlled material traits are desired . 
Zinc and its alloys constitute the new generation of biodegradable metallic materials for biomedical implants . 
Biodegradable implants of Zn , customized for the specific patient can be potentially realised through additive manufacturing processes such as selective laser melting ( SLM ) . 
However , Zn is characterized by low melting and boiling points , resulting in high porosity in the build parts . 
In this work , the SLM of pure Zn powder is studied to improve part density . 
A flexible prototype SLM system was used to determine process feasibility under different atmospheric conditions . 
Working in a closed chamber under inert gas was found to be inadequate . 
Process stability was obtained in an open chamber with an inert gas jet flow over the powder bed . 
The effect of laser process parameters and powder size was studied in this condition . 
This paper demonstrates a simple , low-cost additive manufacturing technique for fabricating structures compatible with high-density packaging solutions . 
A T-line resonator is characterized to understand the transmission line losses associated with the vertical bends . 
Details of the simulation , fabrication , and measurements are presented . 
Simulations are carried out using ANSYS High-Frequency Structure Simulator ( HFSS® ) , and structures are fabricated using a polyjet printing process . 
The measured results are in good agreement with the simulation results , and overall a good performance is achieved for all the antenna designs . 
Laser powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) is the most prominent additive manufacturing ( AM ) technology for metal part production . 
Among the high number of factors influencing part quality and mechanical properties , the inter layer time ( ILT ) between iterative melting of volume elements in subsequent layers is almost completely unappreciated in the relevant literature on L-PBF . 
This study investigates the effect of ILT with respect to build height and under distinct levels of volumetric energy density ( VED ) using the example of 316L stainless steel . 
In-situ thermography is used to gather information on cooling conditions during the process , which is followed by an extensive metallographic analysis . 
Significant effects of ILT and build height on heat accumulation , sub-grain sizes , melt pool geometries and hardness are presented . 
Furthermore , the rise of defect densities can be attributed to a mutual interplay of build height and ILT . 
Hence , ILT has been identified as a crucial factor for L-PBF of real part components especially for those with small cross sections . 
Crack-free nickel-based single crystal superalloy samples were fabricated via directed energy deposition . 
Hot cracking occurred at high-angle grain boundaries and especially at low-angle grain boundaries . 
The existence conditions of the liquid film for hot cracking in CMSX-10 are calculated with analysis models . 
The hot cracking mechanism is related to the stability of liquid film , stress concentration and Re-rich precipitations . 
Hot cracking is a frequent and severe defect that occurs during the directed energy deposition ( DED ) of single-crystal superalloys . 
Understanding the cracking behavior and mechanism is key to avoiding these defects . 
Hot cracking occurred at high-angle grain boundaries and especially at low-angle grain boundaries . 
Hot cracking was determined to be caused by a stable liquid film , stress concentration , and Re-rich precipitates . 
The stability of the liquid film depended on dendrite coalescence undercooling which was related to the misorientation angle . 
The dendrite coalescence undercooling at low-angle grain boundary ( misorientation angle 6.9° ) was 178 K , which was far higher than the vulnerable temperature interval 38 K for hot cracking within a single dendrite . 
Stress concentration provided the driving force for crack initiation and propagation . 
Re-rich precipitates promoted crack initiation by a pinning effect on the liquid feed . 
These findings provide technical support for achieving high-quality additive manufacturing and repair of non-weldable Ni-based single-crystal superalloys . 
LMDed Ti-Mo alloy , from elemental powder mixture , presents an almost defect-free feature . 
Phase transition from α to β appears as results of in-situ thermal cycling . 
Textural density of α phase increases significantly , given to the in-situ thermal cycling . 
The LMDed Ti-Mo present a graded tensile property . 
In this work , almost dense ( over 99.8 % ) Ti-Mo alloy samples were manufactured by directed energy deposition ( DED ) from a mixture of pure Ti and pure Mo ( 7.5 wt. 
% ) powders . 
As a consequence of thermal accumulation and in-situ heat treating during the DED process , as-deposited samples present a graded microstructure along the building direction along with a phase transition from hcp-α Ti to bbc-β Ti . 
Mechanical properties were determined by tensile tests from flat samples harvested at different altitude positions . 
As altitude increases from the base plate , yield strength decreases from 681 MPa to 579 MPa and ultimate tensile strength from 791 MPa to 686 MPa . 
Elongation of the as-deposited material increases from 10 % to 25 % while the Young ’ s modulus keeps a low value of 105 GPa for the entire DEDed sample . 
AM parts are fabricated with intentional inhomogeneities to create codes . 
The controlled and random process variation ensures a unique material structure . 
The L-PBF approach creates random pores by a reduced volume energy density . 
The L-DED approach utilizes the different magnetic permeability of two materials . 
Additive manufacturing technologies enable various possibilities to create and modify the material composition and structure on a local level , but are often prone to undesired defects and inhomogeneities . 
By controlled and random process variation , unique codes that can be read and authenticated by an eddy current device were produced with the processes of laser powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) and laser directed energy deposition ( L-DED ) . 
Two approaches are presented : First , volumetric , porous structures with a defined shape are manufactured with L-PBF . 
Second , coatings are fabricated by L-DED with alternating process parameters , leading to local deviations of the magnetic permeability . 
Counterfeiting becomes impossible due to the irreproducible melt pool dynamics . 
Laser-induced forward transfer ( LIFT ) , a 3D additive manufacturing technique is implemented to fabricate a fully metallic functional micro device . 
Digital deposition of both structural and sacrificial metal constituents in the same setup arrangement is achieved . 
The final free-standing structure is released by selective chemical wet etching of the support material . 
Using this approach , a chevron-type electro thermal micro-actuator made of gold was successfully fabricated and its functionality was shown in experiment . 
Comparison of the measured responses with the model predictions indicates that the thermal conductivity of printed Au is approximately 8 times lower than the bulk value . 
It is a first demonstration of a functional micron scale actuator printed using LIFT . 
In this paper , a predictive model based on a cellular automaton ( CA ) -finite element ( FE ) method has been developed to simulate thermal history and microstructure evolution during metal solidification for a laser-based additive manufacturing process . 
The macroscopic FE calculation was designed to update the temperature field and simulate a high cooling rate . 
In the microscopic CA model , heterogeneous nucleation sites , preferential growth orientation , and dendritic grain growth were simulated . 
The CA model was able to show the entrapment of neighboring cells and the relationship between undercooling and the grain growth rate . 
The model predicted the dendritic grain size , and morphological evolution during the solidification phase of the deposition process . 
The grain morphology result has been validated by the experiment . 
SLM process was optimized via polynomial regression model . 
Remelting step between SLM scans led to homogenization of the metal powders . 
Si addition increased the tensile strength while maintaining the ductility . 
Interaction between dislocation loops with dislocations strengthened the alloy . 
Effect of solid solution and dislocation loop on yield strength were quantified . 
To widen the applications of new materials in additive manufacturing ( AM ) , the traditional method of printing using pre-alloyed powders should be improved because the pre-alloying process is expensive and makes it difficult to adjust the composition of new materials . 
This study investigates the synthesis of a FeCoCrNi high-entropy alloy ( HEA ) containing 1.5 at. 
% Si in situ using selective laser melting ( SLM ) . 
A remelting strategy and process optimization based on polynomial regression modeling allowed for the printing of almost fully dense ( 99.78 % ) samples . 
The samples comprised columnar grains , each containing numerous subgrains of a single-phase face-centered cubic solid solution . 
No precipitation or segregation were observed . 
The room temperature tensile properties of the samples were excellent , with yields and tensile strengths reaching 701 ± 14 and 907 ± 25 MPa , respectively , and an elongation at fracture of 30.8 ± 2 % . 
These properties were attributed to solid solution strengthening and novel dislocation loop strengthening mechanism . 
These findings demonstrate that HEAs with a high relative density and good mechanical properties can be directly synthesized by SLM using inexpensive pure metal powders , thereby extending the application potential of AM to manufacture new materials . 
This paper presents a new approach for modelling additive layer manufacturing at component scale . 
The approach is applied to powder-bed selective laser melting ( SLM ) and validated , where the mechanical behaviour of macro-scale industrial components has been predicted and compared with experimental results . 
The novelty of the approach is based on using a calibrated analytical thermal model to derive functions that are implemented in a structural finite element analysis ( FEA ) . 
The induced distortion in SLM has been compensated for by modifying the initial geometry using FE predicted distortion . 
A newly developed distortion compensation method , based on optical 3D scan measurements , has also been implemented . 
The two distortion compensation methods have been experimentally validated . 
In summary , the research presented in this paper shows that the mitigation of distortion in SLM is now possible on industrial macro-scale components . 
This paper reports on X-ray tomography of a series of coupon samples ( 5 mm cubes ) produced under different process parameters , for laser powder bed fusion of Ti6Al4V . 
Different process parameters result in different pore formation mechanisms , each with characteristic pore sizes , shapes and locations within the 5 mm cube samples . 
While keyhole pores , lack of fusion pores and metallurgical pores have been previously identified and illustrated using X-ray tomography , this work extends beyond prior work to show how each of these not only exist in extreme situations but how they vary in size and shape in the transition regimes . 
It is shown how keyhole mode porosity increases gradually with increasing power , and how this depends on the scan speed . 
Similarly , lack of fusion pores are shown to occur following scan tracks in situations of poor hatch overlap , or a similar but different distribution of lack of fusion porosity due to large layer height spacing , showing respectively vertical and horizontal lack of fusion pore morphologies . 
Insights from 3D images allow improvements in parameter choices for optimized density of parts produced by laser powder bed fusion , and generally allow a better understanding of the porosity present in additively manufactured parts . 
This work investigates an additive manufacturing route of producing functional net shaped parts from pre-alloyed magnetic shape-memory Ni-Mn-Ga powders . 
Three types of Ni-Mn-Ga powders were used in this investigation : spark eroded in liquid nitrogen ( LN2 ) , spark eroded in liquid argon ( LAr ) , and ball milled ( BM ) . 
Additive manufacturing via powder bed binder jetting , also known as 3D printing ( 3DP ) , was used in this research due to both relatively easy control of part porosity and the possibility to obtain complex shaped parts from Ni-Mn-Ga alloys . 
The four-dimension ( 4D ) is created by the predictable change in 3D printed part configuration over time as the result of shape-memory functionality . 
Binder jetting of Ni-Mn-Ga powders followed by curing and sintering proved successful in producing net shaped porous structures ( spring-like , 3-D hierarchical lattice structures , etc . ) 
with good mechanical strength . 
Parts with porosities between 24.08 % and 73.43 % have been obtained by using powders with distinct morphologies . 
Thermo-magneto-mechanical trained 3D printed parts obtained from ball milled Ni-Mn-Ga powders showed reversible magnetic-field-induced strains ( MFISs ) of up to 0.01 % . 
The additive manufacturing is a viable technology in solving the design issues of functional parts made of Ni-Mn-Ga magnetic shape-memory alloys ( MSMA ) . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) technologies are capable of fabricating custom parts with complex geometrical shapes in a short period of time relative to traditional fabrication processes that require expensive tooling and several post processing steps . 
Material extrusion AM , known commercially as Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) technology , is a widely used polymer AM process , however , the effects of inherent porosity on mechanical strength continues to be researched to identify strength improvement solutions . 
To address the effect of porosity and layer adhesion on mechanical properties ( which can sometimes result in 27–35 % lower ultimate tensile strength when compared to plastic injection molding ) , an approach was employed to reinforce 3D printed polycarbonate ( PC ) parts with continuous carbon fiber ( CF ) bundles . 
Results demonstrated a maximum of 77 % increase in tensile yield strength when PC was reinforced with three CF bundles and micrographs showed multiple regions with zero porosity due to the CF inclusion . 
PC with three bundles of CF ( modulus of 3.36 GPa ) showed 85 % higher modulus of elasticity than the neat PC specimens ( modulus of 1.82 GPa ) . 
The manual placement of CF and its impact on mechanical properties motivated the development of an automated selective deposition method using an ultrasonic embedding apparatus . 
Substantial technology development towards the embedding process of continuous carbon fiber bundles using ultrasonic energy was achieved in an automated fashion which is complementary of digital manufacturing and novel when compared to other existing processes . 
Laser Engineered Net Shaping ( LENS™ ) is a commercially available additive manufacturing technique that was used for one step manufacturing of bimetallic structures of stainless steel and Ti6Al4V ( Ti64 ) alloy . 
In the first approach , direct deposition of Ti64 on SS410 substrate and compositionally graded bimetallic structures were attempted without any intermediate bond layer . 
In the second approach , an intermediate NiCr bond layer ( of thickness ∼750 μm ) was deposited to minimize thermal and residual stresses for these bimetallic structures . 
Direct deposition of Ti64 was successful only for a couple of layers before the structures were delaminated . 
Compositionally graded bonding was unsuccessful with the formation of brittle intermetallics and related residual stresses causing delamination . 
Using an intermediate NiCr layer , bimetallic structures were successfully fabricated . 
Our work is focused on LENS™ based processing approach and related microstructural evolution towards bimetallic structures . 
Residual stresses are measured for different deposition patterns . 
The evolution of residual stresses and distortions are modelled in 3D . 
The effect of convective flow inside the molten pool are examined . 
Susceptibilities to delamination & warping of Ti-6Al-4V & Inconel 718 are examined . 
Since the deposition patterns affect the stresses and distortions , we examined their effects on multi-layer wire arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) of Ti-6Al-4V and Inconel 718 components experimentally and theoretically . 
We measured residual stresses by hole drilling method in three identical components printed using different deposition patterns . 
In order to understand the origin and the temporal evolution of residual stresses and distortion , we used a well-tested thermo-mechanical model after validating the computed results with experimental data for different deposition patterns . 
Distortions were also examined based on non-dimensional analysis.We show that printing with short track lengths can minimize residual stresses and distortion among the three patterns investigated for both alloys . 
Both Ti-6Al-4V and Inconel 718 had similar fusion zone shape and size and were equally susceptible to deformation and warping , although Ti-6Al-4V was relatively less vulnerable to delamination due to its higher yield strength . 
A dimensionless strain parameter accurately predicted the effects of WAAM parameters on distortion and this approach is especially useful when the detailed thermo-mechanical calculations can not be undertaken . 
The present work aims to investigate the mechanism of crack initiation induced by internal pores , which are inevitable in additive manufacturing ( AM ) , and the influence of internal pores on the fatigue performance of directed energy deposited ( DED ) Ti-6.5Al-2Zr-Mo-V. After fatigue test under constant amplitude alternating stress at three stress levels , thirty-one pieces of DED Ti-6.5Al-2Zr-Mo-V specimens were found that cracks initiating from internal pores . 
Scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) and its accessories , such as energy dispersive spectrometry ( EDS ) and electron backscattered diffraction ( EBSD ) , were used to analyze the characteristics of pore defects and clarify the mechanism of crack initiation . 
The results show that the specificity of the microstructure affected by the DED process and pore defects , such as segregation of Al and the existence of incomplete grain boundaries , are the main causes of crack initiation . 
Then , the crack initiation modes were divided into three types , and a classification model was established that can make the effect of pore defects on fatigue life clearer and more intuitive . 
The current study presents low cost 3D printed materials with desired electrical charactrestics for RF/microwave applications . 
In contrast to the traditional manufacturing techniques of fabrication in electronics , additive manufacturing ( AM ) is a proper technology for making parts with more advanced complex features . 
In this study , different 3D printed configurations ( infill density and pattern ) of materials were printed with Fused Deposition Modeling ( FDM ) technique to achieve different electrical characteristics , which is used in design and fabrication of RF/microwave structures . 
By different filling configurations , a range of relative permittivity has been obtained by using Nylon 6 as an input filament for 3D printing . 
In fact , by use of a known material such as Nylon 6 , complex geometries can be 3D printed with different dielectric behavior . 
Mechanical properties of the structures were investigated in order to estimate the quality of the 3D printed parts in electronics ’ industry . 
Considering these properties has direct influence on decision making through the design of a 3D structure with required electrical characteristics , while the mechanical properties are also considered . 
Binder jetting , a commercial additive manufacturing process that selectively deposits a liquid binder onto a powder bed , can become a viable method to additively manufacture ceramics . 
part density and geometric resolution ) have not been investigated and no methodical approach exists for the process development of new materials . 
In this work , a parametric study consisting of 18 experiments with unique process input combinations explores the influence of seven process inputs on the relative densities of as-printed ( green ) alumina ( Al2O3 ) parts . 
Sensitivity analyses compare the influence of each input on green densities . 
Multivariable linear and Gaussian process regressions provide models for predicting green densities as a function of binder jetting process inputs . 
The multivariable linear and Gaussian process regression models indicate that the green densities of alumina builds can be increased by decreasing the recoat speed and increasing the oscillator speed . 
The Gaussian process regression model further suggests that the green densities have nonlinear dependence on the rest of the process parameters . 
The models produced can assist operators in selecting process inputs that will result in a desired green density , allowing for the control of porosity in printed parts with a high degree of accuracy . 
The methodology reported in this study can be leveraged for other powder systems and machines to predict and control the porosity of binder jetted parts for applications such as filters , bearings , electronics , and medical implants . 
Electron beam melting ( EBM ) has emerged as an important additive manufacturing technique . 
In this study , Alloy 718 produced by EBM was investigated in as-built and post-treated conditions for microstructural characteristics and hardness . 
The post-treatments investigated were hot isostatic pressing ( HIP ) and combined HIP + heat treatment ( HIP + HT ) carried out as a single cycle inside the HIP vessel . 
Both the post-treatments resulted in significant decrease in defects inevitably present in the as-built material . 
The columnar grain structure of the as-built material was found to be maintained after post-treatment , with some sporadic localized grain coarsening noted . 
Although HIP led to complete dissolution of δ and γ′′ phase , stable NbC and TiN ( occasionally present ) particles were observed in the post-treated specimens . 
Significant precipitation of γ′′ phase was observed after HIP + HT , which was attributed to the two-step aging heat treatment carried out during HIP + HT . 
The presence of γ′′ phase or otherwise was correlated to the hardness of the material . 
While the HIP treatment resulted in drop in hardness , HIP + HT led to ‘ recovery ’ of the hardness to values exceeding those exhibited by the as-built material . 
The cold spray has been shown to be one of the promising additive manufacturing technologies to process Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene ( UHMWPE ) -metal integrated systems by successfully being able to coat UHMWPE on metals using fumed nano-alumina ( FNA ) as UHMWPE particle surface modifiers . 
However , the exact mechanism of UHMWPE deposition and role of FNA was widely unknown . 
This study aims at identifying the fundamental parameters involved in high strain-rate UHMWPE deposition and their role in successful adhesion by a technique called Isolated Particle Deposition ( IPD ) . 
Major parameters that influenced the UHMWPE deposition efficiency significantly were the particle temperature and velocity and net surface activity of FNA . 
The stored elastic energy of UHMWPE decreases with increase in temperature , and the deposition criterion for a successful UHMWPE deposition is not to have net stored elastic energy after impact . 
Effect of FNA was seen in generating H-bonds that helped to establish bridge bond at UHMWPE-substrate interface . 
Innovative fabrication of a < NiCrAlY-IN625 > system by SLM was demonstrated . 
Several criteria were used to select the most appropriate SLM process conditions . 
As-built coatings exhibited significant dilution characteristic of SLM remelting . 
Laser power P = 250 W and scanning speed v = 800 mm/s were found optimal . 
The present study investigated for the first time the feasibility of producing by Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) a NiCrAlY bond coat material directly onto an IN625 substrate itself produced by SLM . 
A typical parameters optimization was conducted by varying laser power ( P ) and scanning speed ( v ) . 
Single-line scanning tracks and two-layer coatings were carried out and analyzed for 15 different P/v conditions . 
Several criteria were defined for the selection of appropriate SLM parameters . 
The results showed significant remelting of the underlying substrate , which is a typical feature of SLM manufacturing . 
This led to the formation of an intermediate dilution zone characterized by substantial mixing between IN625 superalloy substrate and NiCrAlY bond coat suggesting excellent metallurgical bonding . 
Optimum processing conditions were found for P = 250 W and v = 800 mm/s . 
It produced a dense 242 μm thick bond coat including a 36 % dilution zone . 
The SLMed < NiCrAlY-IN625 > system exhibited a smooth microhardness profile slightly increasing from 275 Hv in the bond coat to 305 Hv in the substrate . 
A progressive Al concentration distribution between the phases and low residual stress levels were found in the system . 
This suggested that SLM might be a valuable alternative manufacturing process for bond coat systems promoting excellent adhesion for high temperature applications . 
Coupling 3D Discrete Element and Monte Carlo Ray tracing methods to simulate the laser polymer interaction . 
Multiphysics coupling : conductive and radiative heat transfers with scattering , phase changes , coalescence , air diffusion , in participating granular medium . 
Application to additive manufacturing process . 
3D Numerical and experimental validations . 
A numerical framework based on a modified Monte Carlo ray-tracing method and the Discrete Element Method ( DEM ) is developed to predict the physical behavior of discrete particles during the Powder Bed Fusion ( SLS ) process . 
A comprehensive model coupling all major aspects of the underlying physics and the corresponding numerical framework , accounting for radiative heat transfer , heat conduction , sintering and granular dynamics among others , is developed . 
The spatially and temporally varying distribution of heat and displacement within the additively manufactured object are captured in detail . 
The model is validated through the comparison of simulated results with existing experimental results in the literature . 
Inconsistent part quality is a challenge to the widespread adoption of powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing . 
Previous efforts to monitor the PBF process in situ have been mostly limited to single tracks . 
The lack of quantitative , in situ monitoring results from full 3D PBF builds remains a barrier to closed-loop control . 
We track morphology in situ using coherent imaging , providing an immediate check on surface roughness , recoater blade damage , and powder packing density . 
Defects are corrected through manual closed-loop control ; protrusions and depressions identified by in situ imaging are compensated through laser ablation and refilling , respectively , during a 3D build . 
Maximum surface roughness is reduced by 54 % and the number of layers with increased surface roughness relative to the steady-state value is reduced by 60 % . 
Manual closed-loop control , successfully achieved using coherent imaging of PBF layer morphology , is an important step towards full feedback control capabilities . 
Laser direct deposition model simulates thermal behavior in Ti6Al4V depositions . 
Cellular automaton model predicts the solidification and distribution of β grains . 
Phase prediction model simulates the solid-state phase transformation of β→α/α ’ . 
Microhardness was assessed based on the predicted volume fraction of α ’ . 
Simulation results were validated with experimental data in good agreement . 
In this paper , a multiphysics and multiscale integrated simulation framework is established to link the thermal history with the microstructural evolution and resulting properties of Ti6Al4V in additive manufacturing processes by combining : ( 1 ) a three-dimensional ( 3D ) multiphysics modeling of quasi-steady-state deposition geometry and thermal history in the directed energy deposition ( DED ) process , ( 2 ) a 3D cellular automata modeling of the solidification grain structure , and ( 3 ) a diffusion/diffusionless kinetic modeling of solid-state phase transformation and microhardness prediction based on the simulated phase volume fractions . 
By applying to Ti6Al4V , this integrated simulation framework demonstrates its feasibility in modeling complex microstructural evolution and phase transformation during the multi-track DED process . 
The simulated track geometry and thermal history agree well with experimental results . 
Coupled with the extracted temperature profiles and heating/cooling rates , the competitive growth of β grains upon solidification of the molten pool is successfully predicted . 
The solid-state β→α/α´ transformation in the fusion zone and heat-affected zone is then captured by the kinetic solid-state phase prediction model . 
With the predicted volume fractions of α and α´ in the final microstructure , the microhardness is assessed , matching the experimental measurements . 
Laser sintering ( LS ) , as an additive manufacturing process for production of polymer structures , provides the possibility of directly manufacturing personalized , structural motorcycle components for motor sports . 
To create such lightweight structures , the wall thickness and position limits of the LS systems need to be investigated in detail . 
Appearing process-related flaws such as different amounts of crystallinity , surface roughness , and defects such as pores exhibit dimensions similar to the wall thickness . 
To study the process-related effects on the mechanical properties of 450 tensile test specimens in z-direction , the build areas of two LS systems were screened and a detailed wall thickness investigation was conducted . 
In addition , dynamic mechanical analysis , differential scanning calorimetry , and scanning electron microscopy for several wall thicknesses similar to the spot size were conducted . 
The investigations showed that the Young 's moduli and ultimate tensile strengths of the produced specimens of the two commercial EOS systems , P396 and P770 , are similar and evenly distributed . 
Furthermore , structures with a thickness below 1 mm showed distinctive losses in stiffness , ultimate tensile strength , and elongation at break . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) is an additive manufacturing and 3D printing technology which offers flexibility in geometric design and rapid production of complex structures . 
Maraging steels have high strength and good ductility , and therefore have been widely used in aerospace and tooling sectors for many years . 
This work aims to study the influence of aging temperature and aging time on the microstructure , mechanical property ( hardness , strength and ductility ) and tribological property of SLM maraging 18Ni-300 steel . 
The results reveal that the aging conditions had a significant impact on the strength and wear-resistance of the SLM maraging steel . 
The optimal aging conditions for the SLM maraging steel produced in this work were 490 °C for 3 h under which strength and wear-resistance were maximised . 
Lower or higher aging temperature led to under-aging or over-aging phenomena , reducing the strength and wear-resistance performance . 
Shorter or longer aging time also resulted in the decrease of strength and wear-resistance performance of the SLM maraging steel as compared with the optimal conditions . 
The variation of the mechanical and tribological properties is primarily due to changes in phase compositions and microstructures of the SLM maraging steels . 
The integration of novel additively manufactured ( AM ) materials and processes with traditional materials and manufacturing techniques , including the insertion of commercial off-the-shelf ( COTS ) components such as resistors , switches , batteries and light emitting diodes ( LEDs ) , has led to the development of increasingly complex ‘ hybrid ’ electronics including : antennas , waveguides , radio frequency identification ( RFID ) tags , various sensors , circuits and devices . 
Here we examine the resiliency and radio frequency ( RF ) performance of two commercially available conductive inks ( DuPont CB028 and KA801 ) printed onto a radar transparent substrate ( poly ether , ether ketone ; PEEK ) . 
The quality of ink adhesion , a factor found to directly correlate with antenna performance , is examined via adhesion testing after exposure to high accelerations up to 20,000 g and temperature cycling from −54 °C to +71 °C . 
Overall , the designs , procedures and results provide a framework for multi-materials resiliency assessment as well as aspects unique to materials resiliency under harsh environmental conditions . 
Lattice structures have been intensively researched for their light-weight properties and unique functions in specific applications such as for impact protection and biomedical-implant . 
The advancement of additive manufacturing simplifies the fabrication of lattice structures as opposed to conventional manufacturing and this opens doors to create more designs . 
There are ample research opportunities to explore the mechanical performance of the lattice structures fabricated by this technology specific to each design . 
This study filled the research gap by investigating the deformation behaviour and compressive properties of Ti-6Al-4V lattice structures fabricated by a powder bed fusion method from the aspects of design , orientation and density . 
The results were compared between cubic and honeycomb unit designs , between two orientations and across five different densities . 
Results showed that both cubic and honeycomb lattice deformed in a layer-by-layer manner for the first tested orientation , where vertical struts were parallel to the compression direction . 
In the second tested orientation , where lattice struts were angled with respect to the direction of compression , the deformation behaviour was observed as a single diagonal shear band . 
As the density of the structure increased , the deformation pattern shifted towards diagonal crack similar to a solid part . 
Honeycomb lattice structure had the highest density efficiency for energy absorption in both orientations and for first maximum compressive strength in the second orientation . 
Change of orientation significantly affected the efficiency in plateau stress for cubic lattice structure , and compressive property values for honeycomb lattice structure . 
Comparative studies showed that the first maximum compressive strength and energy absorption of the lattice structures in the first orientation were higher than most of the lattice designs from other literature . 
This paper describes a facile method to fabricate complex three-dimensional ( 3D ) antennas by vacuum filling gallium-based liquid metals into 3D printed cavities at room temperature . 
To create the cavities , a commercial printer co-prints a sacrificial wax-like material with an acrylic resin . 
Dissolving the printed wax in oil creates cavities as small as 500 μm within the acrylic monolith . 
Placing the entire structure under vacuum evacuates most of the air from these cavities through a reservoir of liquid metal that covers a single inlet . 
Returning the assembly to atmospheric pressure pushes the metal from the reservoir into the cavities due to the pressure differential . 
This method enables filling of the closed internal cavities to create planar and curved conductive 3D geometries without leaving pockets of trapped air that lead to defects . 
An advantage of this technique is the ability to rapidly prototype 3D embedded antennas and other microwave components with metallic conductivity at room temperature using a simple process . 
Because the conductors are liquid , they also enable the possibility of manipulating the properties of such devices by flowing metal in or out of selected cavities . 
The measured electrical properties of fabricated devices match well to electromagnetic simulations , indicating that the approach described here forms antenna geometries with high fidelity . 
Residual stresses and distortion in Additive Manufactured ( AM ) parts are two key obstacles which seriously hinder the wide application of this technology . 
Nowadays , understanding the thermomechanical behavior induced by the AM process is still a complex task which must take into account the effects of both the process and the material parameters , the microstructure evolution as well as the pre-heating strategy . 
One of the challenges of this work is to increase the complexity of the geometries used to study the thermomechanical behavior induced by the AM process . 
The samples have been fabricated by Directed Energy Deposition ( DED ) . 
In-situ thermal and distortion histories of the substrate are measured in order to calibrate the 3D coupled thermo-mechanical model . 
Once the numerical results showed a good agreement with the temperature measurements , the validated model has been used to predict the residual stresses and distortions . 
Different process parameters have been analyzed to study their sensitivity to the process assessment . 
Different preheating strategies have been also analyzed to check their effectiveness on the mitigation of both distortions and residual stresses . 
Finally , some simplifications of the actual scanning sequence are proposed to reduce the computational cost without loss of the accuracy of the simulation framework . 
Laser-Powder Bed Fusion ( L-PBF ) , an additive manufacturing process , produces a distinctive microstructure that closely resembles the weld metal microstructure but at a much finer scale . 
The solidification parameters , particularly temperature gradient and solidification rate , are important to study the as-built microstructure . 
In the present study , a computational framework with meso-scale resolution is developed for L-PBF of Inconel® 718 ( IN718 ) , a Ni-base superalloy . 
The framework combines a powder packing model based on Discrete Element Method and a 3-D transient heat and fluid flow simulation . 
The latter , i.e. 
, the molten pool model , captures the interaction between laser beam and individual powder particles including free surface evolution , surface tension and evaporation . 
The solidification parameters , calculated from the temperature fields , are used to assess the solidification morphology and grain size using existing theoretical models . 
The IN718 coupon built by L-PBF are characterized using optical and scanning electron microscopies . 
The experimental data of molten pool size and solidification microstructure are compared to the corresponding simulation results . 
Selective laser sintering , also called laser sintering ( LS ) , is an additive manufacturing process that requires micronized plastic powder . 
Recently , we showed poly ( ethylene terephthalate ( PET ) powder is a suitable material for LS , with a comparable printing performance as the current front-runner , polyamide 12 ( PA12 ) . 
However , the LS process , by its nature , leaves unused powder that has been exposed to heat for prolonged time , and this powder may not be fully re-usable due to degradation.In this work , the re-use potential of heat-exposed PET powder is established . 
This is a matter of crucial importance as powders suitable for LS are very expensive , and the powder left after a building episode has to be re-used . 
Heat-exposed PA12 has to be blended or refreshed with virgin powder , to avoid printing defects . 
In contrast , heat-exposed PET powder , after 96 h at 210 °C , could be used , without refreshing with a portion of virgin powder . 
The printed articles from heat-exposed powders were as good as those from the fresh powder . 
There was no cross-linking and there was only a minor increase in the molecular weight of the powder after 96 h , at 210 °C . 
Electron Beam Melting ( EBM ) is an increasingly used Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) technique employed by many industrial sectors , including the medical device and aerospace industries . 
The application of this technology is , however , challenged by the lack of process monitoring and control system that underpins process repeatability and part quality reproducibility . 
An electronic imaging system prototype has been developed to serve as an EBM monitoring equipment , the capabilities of which have been verified at room temperature and at 320 ± 10 °C . 
Nevertheless , in order to fully assess the applicability of this technique , electronic imaging needs to be conducted at a range of elevated temperatures to fully understand the influence of temperature on electronic image quality . 
Building on top of the previous electronic imaging trials at room temperature , this paper disseminates the essential step changes to allow high temperature electronic imaging : ( 1 ) modification of a signal amplifier to deal with high electron beam current during electron beam heating , and ( 2 ) design of an open-source electron beam heating algorithm to maximise flexibility for user-defined heating strategy . 
In this paper , electronic imaging pilot trials at elevated temperatures , ranging from room temperature to 650°C , were carried out . 
Image quality measure Q of the digital electron images was evaluated , and the influence of temperature was investigated . 
In this study , raw electronic images generated at higher temperatures had greater Q values , i.e . 
better global image quality . 
It has been demonstrated that , for temperatures between 30°C-650°C , the influence of temperature on electronic image quality was not adversely affecting the visual clarity of image features . 
It is thus envisaged that the prototype has a potential to contribute to in-process EBM monitoring , and this paper has served as a crucial precursor to the ultimate goal of carrying out electronic imaging under real EBM building condition . 
Local microstructure control in electron beam powder bed fusion ( EB-PBF ) is of great interest to the additive manufacturing community to realize complex part geometry with targeted performance . 
The local microstructure control relies on having a detailed understanding of local melt pool physics ( e.g. 
, 3-D melt pool shape as well as spatial and temporal variations of thermal gradient ( G ) and solidification rate ( R ) ) . 
In this research , a new scan strategy referred to as ghost beam is numerically evaluated as a candidate to achieve the targeted G and R of IN718 alloy . 
The boundary conditions for simulations , including the speed ( 490 mm/s ) and spatial locations of the beam within a given layer , are obtained by using series of snapshot images , recorded at 12,000 frames per second , using a high-speed camera . 
The heat transfer simulations were performed using TRUCHAS an open-source software deployed within a high-performance computational infrastructure . 
The simulation results showed that reheating at short beam on-time and time delay decreases both G and R. Local variation of R at the center of the melt pool trailing edge showed periodic temporal fluctuations . 
This paper introduces continuous lattice fabrication ( CLF ) – a novel additive manufacturing ( AM ) technique invented for fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites – and demonstrates its ability to exploit anisotropic material properties in digitally fabricated structures . 
In contrast to the layer-by-layer approaches employed in most AM processes , CLF enables the directed orientation of the fibers in all spatial coordinates , that is in the x- , y- , and z-directions . 
Based on a serial pultrusion and extrusion approach , CLF consolidates commingled yarns in situ and allows for the continuous deposition of high fiber volume fraction ( > 50 % ) materials along a programmable trajectory without the use of molds or sacrificial layers by exploiting the high viscosities of fiber-filled polymer melts . 
The capacity of CLF to produce high-performance structural components is demonstrated in the fabrication of an ultra-lightweight load-bearing lattice structure with outstanding stiffness-to-density and strength-to-density performance ( compression modulus of 13.23 MPa and compressive strength of 0.20 MPa at a core density of 9 mg/cm3 ) . 
This digital fabrication method enables new approaches in load-tailored design , including the possibility to build freeform structures , which have previously been overlooked due to difficulties and limitations in modern fiber composite manufacturing capabilities . 
Additive Manufacturing provides many advantages in reduced lead times and increased geometric freedom compared to traditional manufacturing methods , but material properties are often reduced . 
This paper considers powder bed fusion of polyamide 12 ( PA12 , Nylon 12 ) produced by three different processes : laser sintering ( LS ) , multijet fusion ( MJF ) /high speed sintering ( HSS ) , and large area projection sintering ( LAPS ) . 
While all utilize similar PA12 materials , they are found to differ significantly in mechanical properties especially in elongation to break . 
The slower heating methods ( MJF/HSS and LAPS ) produce large elongation at break with the LAPS process showing 10x elongation and MJF/HSS exhibiting 2.5x the elongation when compared to commercial LS samples . 
While there are small differences in crystallinity between these samples , the difference may be attributed to changes in the heating and cooling rates of the LAPS samples . 
The maximum inlet velocity of the filament is determined according to the process parameters . 
The velocity field , shear rate and viscosity in the nozzle were determined by analytical study and numerical simulation . 
The extrudate shape agrees with the numerical simulation : the extrudate undergoes severe deformation at high shear rate . 
Fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) is one of the various types of additive manufacturing processes . 
Similar to other types , FFF enables free-form fabrication and optimised structures by using polymeric filaments as the raw material . 
This work aims to optimise the printing conditions of the FFF process based on reliable properties , such as printing parameters and physical properties of polymers . 
The selected polymer is poly ( lactic ) acid ( PLA ) , which is a biodegradable thermoplastic polyester derived from corn starch and is one of the most common polymers in the FFF process . 
Firstly , the maximum inlet velocity of the filament in the liquefier was empirically determined according to process parameters , such as feed rate , nozzle diameter and dimensions of the deposited segment . 
Secondly , the rheological behaviour of the PLA , including the velocity field , shear rate and viscosity distribution in the nozzle , was determined via analytical study and numerical simulation . 
Our results indicated the variation in the shear rate according to the diameter of the nozzle and the inlet velocity . 
Finally , the distribution of the viscosity along the radius of the nozzle was obtained . 
At high inlet velocity , several defects appeared at the surface of the extrudates . 
The defects predicted via numerical simulation were reasonably consistent with that observed from an optical microscope . 
nozzle diameter , feed rate and layer height ) to improve the quality of the manufactured parts . 
Optimized LPBF gives AA7075 parts with density 99.5 % , but containing hot cracks . 
Preventing cracking requires optimization of chemical composition of the powder . 
High isostatic pressing is not effective in healing long cracks . 
Solidification cracks are formed by the liquid film rupture mode . 
Silicon impurity appears to significantly increase stability of the liquid film . 
Laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) is an attractive technology of manufacturing highstrength aluminium alloy parts for the aircraft and automobile industries , limited by poor processability of these alloys . 
This work was aimed at finding the process window for the LPBF manufacturing of defect-free components of AA7075 alloy . 
Optimization of the parameters was performed at each stage of the multi-stage research , i.e . 
At each stage , the relation between LPBF parameters and defect formation with a focus on hot cracking was investigated and discussed . 
Due to the optimization of process parameters , the density of volumetric specimens above 99 % was reached and vaporization losses of the alloying elements were significantly reduced , but solidification cracks could not be eliminated . 
It was found that solidification cracks were formed by the liquid film rupture mode , mainly along columnar grain boundaries . 
The EDS microanalysis showed intergranular microsegregation , not only of the main alloying elements ( Zn , Mg , Cu ) but also of minor elements such as Si . 
Silicon may play a significant role in increasing susceptibility to cracking by increasing the stability of the liquid film . 
Reduction in the silicon impurity content in the AA7075 powder gives a chance to reduce susceptibility to cracking with no change of the alloy specification . 
316L steel powder reuse ( several times ) in SLM leads to the increase of δ-ferrite . 
Magnetic attractive interaction among δ-ferrite powder particles is noticed . 
Particle clustering causes poor packing and non-uniformities in the powder layer . 
Defect formation is more critical when the pin support structure is used . 
Magnetic separation allows separation of austenite and δ-ferrite powder fractions . 
The presence of δ-ferrite in 316L stainless steel powder reused several times contributes to structural defect formation in selective laser melted parts built using the pin support structure . 
The virgin 316L stainless steel powder is fully austenitic . 
After several powder reuse cycles , reused powder has a finer particle size and about 6 vol . 
Phase change occurs due to the thermal cycles imposed on the particles near the melt pool , via spattering and further interaction of in-flight droplets with the laser beam . 
Phase transformation changes the magnetic behavior of the powder leading to particle clustering in the powder bed . 
The uniformity of the powder bed is affected causing defects such as porosity , delamination , warping and lack of fusion . 
These defects are more prone to occur at the beginning of the building process . 
The magnetic and non-magnetic fractions of the reused powder were separated from each other using magnetic separation . 
Powder characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy , laser scattering particle size analysis , X-ray diffraction , and magnetization measurements . 
An explanation for the formation of such defects based on the magnetic behavior of δ-ferrite powder particles is proposed . 
The results suggest that magnetic separation should be used to remove magnetic particles after several reuse cycles . 
In the context of additive manufacturing , we illustrate how computational multi-body dynamics ( CMBD ) analysis can ( a ) increase printing throughput ; and , ( b ) play a role in improving the quality of 3D printed parts . 
Throughput is increased by packing the printing volume with as many parts as possible . 
The problem becomes one of determining where each component that needs to be printed finds itself inside the printing volume . 
Finding the position and orientation of each part is accomplished through CMBD analysis , a point illustrated through an example in which an open-source dynamics engine called Chrono is used to simulate the filling of the active printing volume with a dress that is subsequently 3D printed . 
In relation to ( b ) , we use million-body dynamics simulations to gauge how various granular mixture parameters and rolling regimes combine to ultimately control the roughness of the surface being sintered . 
The quality assessment of AM materials containing defects is a complex topic . 
Multiple defect types were characterised by X-ray CT and metallographic analysis . 
The critical defects in fatigue samples were compared to the statistical estimates . 
Quality correctly assessed by both methods for material obtained by three processes . 
Better precision and lower cost by CT when similar volumes are investigated . 
While the adoption of metal additive manufacturing ( AM ) is growing exponentially owing to its wide range of potential applications , its application to safety-critical and structural parts is significantly impeded by the lack of standards . 
Quality assessment of AM products is a crucial requirement , as the AM process induces internal defects that can have detrimental effects on the fatigue resistance.By evaluating the defect distribution , it is possible to perform a fracture mechanics assessment to estimate the fatigue strength and service lifetime of AM materials . 
This strategy has been successfully applied to selective laser-melted AlSi10Mg by performing X-ray micro-computed tomography ( μCT ) and applying suitable statistical methods ( i.e. 
, statistics of extremes ) . 
The results showed that both techniques were able to pinpoint a significant difference in the prospective largest defect in a material volume corresponding to the gauge section of a specimen . 
However , extrapolation of the critical defect size for fatigue failure using PS data was less accurate and less conservative than that using CT data . 
Investigation of manufacturing continuous ﬁber reinforced thermoplastic polymer composites ( CFRTPCs ) through 3D printing technologies has attracted great attention in the past few years due to excellent properties of CFRTPCs , such as high strength-to-weight ratio and stiffness . 
It is found that the properties of CFRTPCs are affected not only by the properties of the individual parent materials but also by interfacial characteristics . 
Modification of the interface is a great method to improve the wettability between fiber and polymer and hence the mechanical properties of CFRTPCs . 
In this work , an ultrasound-assisted 3D printing device for CFRTPCs is developed . 
The changes of surface profile and chemical structure of carbon fiber and carbon fiber prepreg after ultrasonic treatment are studied . 
The effects of ultrasonic processing parameters on the microstructure and mechanical properties of CFRTPCs are provided . 
It is found that the tensile and flexural strength of composite materials are improved by 34 % and 29 % , respectively , compared with untreated material by using the ultrasonic amplitude of 40 μm , resin solution mass fraction of 10 % , processing speed of 15 mm/s . 
Direct osseous healing to prosthetic components is a prerequisite for the clinical success of uncemented treatment in total hip replacements ( THR ) . 
The demands imposed on the material properties are constantly being stepped up to withstand the impact of an active lifestyle and ensure lifelong integration . 
Cobalt–chromium–molybdenum ( Co-Cr-Mo ) materials are interesting for their excellent mechanical stability , corrosion resistance and possibility to be produced by additive manufacturing into complex designs with modifiable stiffness . 
The bone response to Co-Cr-Mo is regarded as inferior to that of titanium and are usually cemented in THR . 
The hypothesis in the present study was that a low amount of Zr in the Co-Cr-Mo alloy would improve the bone response and biomechanical anchorage . 
The results showed significantly higher implant stability for the Co-Cr-Mo alloy with an addition of 0.04 % Zr after eight weeks of healing in rabbits , while no major differences were observed in the amount of bone formed around the implants . 
Further , bone tissue grew into surface irregularities and in direct contact with the implant surfaces . 
It is concluded that additively manufactured Co-Cr-Mo alloy implants osseointegrate and that the addition of a low amount of Zr to the bulk Co-Cr-Mo further improves the bone anchorage . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) is a widely used additive manufacturing method for building metal parts in a layer-by-layer manner thereby imposing almost no limitations on the geometrical layout of the part . 
The SLM process has a crucial impact on the microstructure , strength , surface quality and even the shape of the part , all of which depend on the thermal history of material points within the part . 
In this paper , we present a computationally tractable thermal model for the SLM process which accounts for individual laser scanning vectors . 
First , a closed form solution of a line heat source is calculated to represent the laser scanning vectors in a semi-infinite space . 
The thermal boundary conditions are accounted for by a complimentary correction field , which is computed numerically . 
The proposed semi-analytical model can be used to simulate manufacturing geometrically complex parts and allows spatial discretisation to be much coarser than the characteristic length scale of the process : laser spot size , except in the vicinity of boundaries . 
The underlying assumption of linearity of the heat equation in the proposed model is justified by comparisons with a fully non-linear model and experiments . 
The accuracy of the proposed boundary correction scheme is demonstrated by a dedicated numerical example on a simple cubic part . 
The influence of the part design and scanning strategy on the temperature transients are subsequently analysed on a geometrically complex part . 
The results show that overhanging features of a part obstruct the heat flow towards the base-plate thereby creating local overheating which in turn decrease local cooling rate . 
Finally , a real SLM process for a part with an overhanging feature is modelled for validation of the proposed model . 
Reasonable agreement between the model predictions and the experimentally measured values can be observed . 
The emergence of 4D printing has revolutionized the additive manufacturing industry by enabling dynamic shape memory effects ensured by the use of smart materials . 
In addition to 3D fabrication , 4D printed products need to undergo shape programming and recovery cycles to achieve desired shape memory effects . 
Due to the new process and material characteristics , energy consumption models established for 3D printing are no longer applicable for 4D printing . 
In current literature , the environmental sustainability for 4D printing has not yet been evaluated , leading to unknown environmental impacts that could be caused by 4D printing processes and/or materials . 
In this research , theoretical models for quantifying the energy consumption in 4D printing thermal-responsive polymers are established by jointly considering the compositional design for materials . 
Experiments and case studies are performed to validate the proposed models and further investigate some critical factors that can affect energy consumption , e.g. 
, values of process parameters like layer thickness , and thermo-temporal conditions in shape memory cycles . 
The case study results show that overall energy consumption can be reduced by 1 ) increasing the concentrations of multi-functional crosslinkers in material composition , and 2 ) setting the shape programming and recovery temperatures as 10 to 15℃ above the material glass transition temperature without compromising the shape fixity and recovery ratios . 
In addition , by adjusting the influential parameters throughout different stages in 4D printing , the total energy consumption can be reduced by 37.33 % , which corresponds to a reduction of 259.52 pounds of CO2 emissions per kilogram methacrylate resin . 
While additive manufacturing ( AM ) , commonly known as 3D printing , has been in existence commercially for ∼30 years , desktop 3D printers are a relatively new and rapidly growing market segment . 
This research highlights differences amongst 45 desktop 3D printers and suggests a method by which to evaluate such differences . 
For this , a standard part consisting of various geometric features was designed and printed using each system . 
An updated version of a previously developed quantitative ranking model was utilized to rate the build precision of each system as well as other features , including build volume , size , cost , weight , and layer resolution . 
In addition , the research team observed part aesthetics and quantified mechanical properties . 
The criteria evaluated in this ranking model may be modified by each user , to extend this methodology to other desktop AM systems , including professional-grade machines . 
As expected , the comparisons demonstrated that each model had slightly different rankings as compared to the model presented in this paper , with some outliers . 
Additive manufacturing of ceramics has been actively investigated with the objective of fabricating complex structures that compete in terms of material performance with traditionally manufactured ceramics but with the benefit of increased geometric freedom . 
More specifically , zirconia provides high fracture toughness and thermal stability . 
In addition , its dielectric permittivity may be the highest among materials available for 3D printing , and may enable the next generation of complex electromagnetic structures . 
NanoParticle Jetting™ is a new material jetting process for selectively depositing nanoparticles and is capable of printing zirconia . 
Dense , fine-featured parts can be manufactured with layer thicknesses as small as 10 μm and jetting resolution of 20 μm after a final sintering step . 
For this study , 3D printed zirconia using NanoParticle Jetting™ was characterized in terms of chemistry , density , crystallography , sintering shrinkage and dielectric properties as a foundation for developing high performance radio frequency ( RF ) components . 
The experimental results indicate a yttria-stabilized ZrO2 structure exhibiting a bulk relative permittivity of 23 and a loss tangent of 0.0013 at microwave frequencies . 
A simple zirconia dielectric resonator antenna is measured , confirming the measured dielectric properties and illustrating a practical application of this material . 
The corrosion behavior of AISI316L AM parts is evaluated before and after the heat treatment then compared with the wrought samples . 
AM parts have a better corrosion behavior compared to the wrought ones due to the absence of non-equilibrium phases . 
The annealed AM sample has an improved corrosion behavior due to the decreasing of the residual stress level . 
The noticeable change in corrosion resistance for the wrought sample is a result of phase transformation . 
This paper presents the investigation of the corrosion behavior of AISI316L samples prepared by laser-based powder bed fusion additive manufacturing ( AM ) method . 
Both AM and conventional stainless steel 316L samples were examined in NaCl 3.5 % solution before and after the annealing process using Tafel curves , Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy , and X-ray diffraction . 
The results indicate that the AM parts have an improved corrosion behavior than the conventional wrought samples . 
Besides , the heat treatment process is found to further decrease the corrosion rate of the AM parts through the relieving of the residual stress . 
In contrast , the post annealing induced improvement to corrosion resistance for the wrought samples is due to the elimination of martensite phase which almost always exists after the plastic deformation during their production process . 
The IN718 sample with deposition rate of 2.2 kg/h and height 75 mm was prepared . 
δ , γ '' and γ ' phase are precipitated in bottom and middle region due to thermal cycle . 
The microhardness and room temperature tensile properties exhibit a high value . 
In order to meet the requirements for rapid manufacturing of large-scale high-performance metal components , the unique advantages of high-deposition-rate laser directed energy deposition ( HDR-LDED , deposition rate ≥ 1 kg/h ) technology have been attracted great attention . 
HDR-LDED technology significantly improves the efficiency by simultaneously increasing the mass and energy input on basis of conventional laser directed energy deposition ( C-LDED , deposition rate ≤ 0.3 kg/h ) , which dramatically changes the solidification condition and thermal cycling effect compared to C-LDED processes . 
Based on this , Inconel 718 bulk samples were fabricated with a deposition rate of 2.2 kg/h and a height of 75 mm . 
Through experimental observation combined with finite element simulation , the precipitation morphology , thermal cycling effect and tensile properties at room temperature of the block samples at heights of 6 mm ( bottom region ) , 37 mm ( middle region ) and 69 mm ( top region ) from the substrate were investigated . 
The results show that both temperature interval and incubation time satisfy the precipitation conditions of the second phases because of the intense thermal cycling effect so that δ , γ '' and γ ' phase are precipitated in the bottom and middle region of the as-deposited sample during the HDR-LDED process . 
As a result , the micro-hardness and the yield strength of the bottom region ( 385 HV ; 745.1 ± 5.2 MPa ) are similar to those of the middle region ( 381 HV ; 752.2 ± 12.1 MPa ) , respectively . 
The tensile fracture mechanism is shown in both fracture and debonding of the Laves phase . 
The inhomogeneous microstructures and corresponding mechanical property differences of Inconel 718 fabricated by HDR-LDED along the deposition direction suggest the necessity to conduct further research of the post heat treatment in the future . 
We demonstrate that a low dielectric constant composite filament , useful for FFF printing , can be manufactured by combining a base thermoplastic polymer with hollow microspheres and a plasticizer . 
Experimental results are provided for filaments made from two different base polymers ( i.e . 
ABS and HDPE ) and varying volume fractions of hollow microspheres . 
We also describe an effective media model to predict the dielectric properties of the composite filaments as a function of the properties of the constituent materials ( e.g . 
base polymer , hollow microspheres ) and their relative volume fractions within the composite filament . 
Experimental test samples were printed using the new low-K filaments and experimental characterization results are provided that validate this approach .

Demonstrated real-time closed-loop control of cured height in photopolymer AM with the interferometry and an empirical dark curing model .

An exemplary study on a lab-scale parallel computing enabled cyber-physical system for AM process sensing , modeling and control . 
Exposure Controlled Projection Lithography ( ECPL ) is an in-house additive manufacturing process that can cure microscale photopolymer parts on a stationary transparent substrate with a time sequence of patterned ultraviolet beams delivered from underneath . 
An in-situ interferometric curing monitoring and measurement ( ICM & M ) system has been developed to measure the ECPL process output of cured height profile . 
This study develops a real-time feedback control system that utilizes an empirical process model and an online ICM & M feedback to automatically and accurately cure a part with targeted height . 
Due to the nature of photopolymerization , the total height of an ECPL cured part is divided into exposure cured height and dark cured height . 
The exposure cured height is controlled by a closed-loop feedback on-off controller . 
The dark cured height is compensated by an empirical process model obtained from the ICM & M measurements for a series of cured parts . 
A parallel computing software application is developed to implement the real-time measurement and control simultaneously . 
The experimental results directly validate the ICM & M system ’ s real-time capability in capturing the process dynamics and in sensing the process output . 
Meanwhile , it evidently demonstrates the feedback control system ’ s satisfactory performance in achieving the setpoint of total height , despite the presence of ECPL process uncertainties , ICM & M noises and computing interruptions . 
Generally , the study establishes a paradigm of improving additive manufacturing with a real-time closed-loop measurement and control system . 
Recent advances in additive manufacturing facilitated the fabrication of parts with great geometrical complexity and relatively small size , and allowed for the fabrication of topologies that could not have been achieved using traditional fabrication techniques . 
In this work , we explore the topology-property relationship of several classes of periodic cellular materials ; the first class is strut-based structures , while the second and third classes are derived from the mathematically created triply periodic minimal surfaces , namely ; the skeletal-TPMS and sheet-TPMS cellular structures . 
Powder bed fusion technology was employed to fabricate the cellular structures of various relative densities out of Maraging steel . 
Scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) was also employed to assess the quality of the printed parts . 
Compressive testing was performed to deduce the mechanical properties of the considered cellular structures . 
Results showed that the sheet-TPMS based cellular structures exhibited a near stretching-dominated deformation behavior , while skeletal-TPMS showed a bending-dominated behavior . 
Overall the sheet-TPMS based cellular structures showed superior mechanical properties among all the tested structures . 
The most interesting observation is that sheet-based Diamond TPMS structure showed the best mechanical performance with nearly independence of relative density . 
It was also observed that at decreased volume fractions the effect of geometry on the mechanical properties is more pronounced . 
Polyhydroxyalkanoate ( PHA ) composites containing siliceous sponge spicules ( SSS ) were prepared from three-dimensional ( 3D ) printing filaments . 
Mechanical and morphological characterizations indicated that the improved adhesion between the SSS and PHA-g-AA enhanced the tensile strength at failure and Young ’ s modulus of the composite compared with that of PHA/SSS . 
The PHA-g-AA/SSS composites were also more water-resistant than the PHA/SSS composites . 
Human foreskin fibroblasts ( FBs ) were seeded on two series of these composites to assess cytocompatibility . 
FB proliferation was greater for the PHA/SSS composites than the PHA-g-AA/SSS composites . 
Moreover , SSS enhanced the antioxidant , anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties of PHA-g-AA/SSS and PHA/SSS composites , demonstrating the potential of PHA-g-AA/SSS and PHA/SSS composites for biomedical material applications . 
Refined microstructure of AlSi10Mg alloy by electron beam melting ( EBM ) technology . 
As-EBM-built AlSi10Mg alloy contains fine granular Si phase and bimodal Al grains . 
As-EBM-built AlSi10Mg alloy is strengthened by the nano-Si precipitates . 
Refining the microstructure to improve the ductility of an Al‒Si alloy is challenging . 
In this paper , we report for the first time a novel microstructure refinement approach for AlSi10Mg ( wt % ) alloys using electron beam melting ( EBM ) technology , without the addition of any modification elements . 
The synergetic effect of superheating , fast cooling , and preheating contributes to a refined Si phase with a fine granular structure ( 0.5–2 μm ) within bimodal Al grains ( 40 μm grains and 0.5–2 μm sub-grains ) . 
A maximum ductility of approximately 32.7 % with a tensile strength of approximately 136 MPa was achieved for the as-built AlSi10Mg EBM alloy . 
After solution heat treatment and T6-like aging , nano-Si precipitates formed which strengthened the alloys . 
The pathway developed in this study for refining the Al–Si alloy microstructure to improve the tensile ductility will provide a feasible and fast manufacturing method for improving the microstructure and mechanical properties of other low-melting temperature alloys in the near future using EBM technology . 
Lunar regolith simulant is used as feedstock in the dry aerosol deposition process . 
Dry aerosol deposition builds thick films on steel , glass and polyimide substrates . 
Mineral mixture is transformed directly to fully dense , nano-grained ceramic film . 
Phase and chemical composition of ceramic films are uniform and homogeneous . 
Small change in composition occurs from powder to coating in aerosol deposition . 
Dry Aerosol Deposition ( DAD ) is a ceramic coating process with the ability to build films and low profile 3D structures layer by layer and is therefore a promising additive manufacturing technique . 
DAD is unique because it uses kinetic energy rather than thermal energy for densification , and the result is a nearly theoretically dense , nano-crystalline ceramic . 
Thick films were successfully deposited onto glass , steel and polyimide substrates via DAD . 
Surface roughness increased with thickness and with some influence from substrate material . 
Utilizing the DAD process , a very heterogeneous mixture of silicate and titanate mineral phases was transformed in a single step to a fully dense , nano-grained coating with spatially homogeneous composition at the micro-scale . 
The final composition of the coatings was found to deviate slightly from the feedstock powder , becoming richer in ilmenite ( FeTiO3 ) and poorer in plagioclase ( feldspar ) content . 
This work demonstrates the potential of DAD for in-space manufacturing and lunar In Situ Resource Utilization . 
Additive manufactured ( AM ) porous materials behave quantitatively and qualitatively differently in fatigue than bulk materials , and the relationships normally used for the fatigue design of continuous bulk materials are not applicable to AM porous materials particularly for low stiffness applications.This study investigated how the manufacturing methods and the material used during powder bed fusion affects the compressive strength and high cycle fatigue strength of a stochastic porous material for a given stiffness . 
Specimens were manufactured using varying laser parameters , 3 scan strategies ( Contour , Points , Pulsing ) and 4 materials . 
The materials investigated were two titanium alloys : commercially pure grade 2 ( CP-Ti ) and Ti6Al4V ELI , commercially pure tantalum ( Ta ) and a titanium-tantalum alloy ( Ti-30Ta ) .The trends observed during fatigue testing for monolithic metals and statically for solid and porous AM materials were not always indicative of the high cycle fatigue behaviour of porous AM materials . 
Unlike their solid counterparts , porous tantalum and the titanium-tantalum alloy had the greatest fatigue strength for a given stiffness , 8 % greater than CP-Ti and 19 % greater than Ti6Al4V ELI . 
Optimisation of the laser parameters and scan strategies was found to also increase the fatigue strength for a given stiffness of porous AM materials by 7–8 % . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) is an additive manufacturing technology which allows parts to be fabricated from metal powder using CAD data . 
Today , standard metal powders like stainless steel , titanium , aluminium or copper are widely used with SLM technology . 
However , none of these materials is suitable for high-temperature applications up to more than 2000 °C such as the diagnostic and inner wall materials of a fusion reactor or experiment . 
As a primary task at the Central Institute of Engineering , Electronics and Analytics , development and manufacturing of high-temperature components for experimental setups are essentially demanded using new technologies and materials . 
Therefore , molybdenum powder is investigated in terms of suitability for SLM technology in this study , due to the capability of molybdenum withstanding high temperature . 
Parameters like laser power , spot velocity and thickness of the powder layer are analysed to achieve high density of the parts . 
Being able to characterize the process signatures of powder bed based additive manufacturing process is key to improving the product quality . 
This paper demonstrates the implementation of a digital fringe projection technique to measure surface topography of the powder bed layers during the fabrication . 
We focus on developing the metrology tool and observing the types of information that can be extracted from such topographical data . 
The performance of the system is demonstrated with selected in situ measurements . 
Experimental results show this system is capable of measuring powder bed signatures including the powder layer flatness , surface texture , the average height drop of the fused regions , characteristic length scales on the surface , and splatter drop location and dimension . 
Mask projection stereolithography is a digital light processing-based additive manufacturing technique that has various advantages , such as high-resolution , scanning-free parallel process , wide material sets available , and support-structure-free three-dimensional ( 3D ) printing . 
However , multi-material 3D printing with mask projection stereolithography has been challenging due to difficulties of exchanging a liquid-state material in a vat . 
In this work , we report a rapid multi-material projection micro-stereolithography using dynamic fluidic control of multiple liquid photopolymers within an integrated fluidic cell . 
Highly complex multi-material 3D micro-structures are rapidly fabricated through an active material exchange process . 
Material flow rate in the fluidic cell , material exchange efficiency , and the effects of energy dosage on curing depth are studied for various photopolymers . 
In addition , the degree of cross-contamination between different materials in a 3D printed multi-material structure is evaluated to assess the quality of multi-material printing . 
The pressure-tight and leak-free fluidic cell enables active and fast switch between liquid photopolymers , even including micro-/nano-particle suspensions , which could potentially lead to facile 3D printing of multi-material metallic/ceramic structures or heterogeneous biomaterials . 
In addition , a multi-responsive hydrogel micro-structure is printed using a thermo-responsive hydrogel and an electroactive hydrogel , showing various modes of swelling actuation in response to multiple external stimuli . 
This new ability to rapidly and heterogeneously integrate multiple functional materials in three-dimension at micro-scale has potential to accelerate advances in many emerging areas including 3D metamaterials , tissue engineering , and soft robotics . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) allows for the production of custom parts with previously impractical internal features , but comes with the additional possibility of internal defects due to print error , residual stress buildup , or cyber-attack by a malicious actor . 
Conventional post process analysis techniques have difficulty detecting these defects , often requiring destructive tests that compromise the integrity ( and thus the purpose ) of the part . 
Here , we present a “ certify-as-you-build ” quality assurance system with the capability to monitor a part during the print process , capture the geometry using three-dimensional digital image correlation ( 3D-DIC ) , and compare the printed geometry with the computer model to detect print errors in situ . 
A test case using a fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) 3D printer was implemented , demonstrating in situ error detection of localized and global defects . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) is a powder-based additive manufacturing technique which creates parts by fusing together successive layers of powder with a laser . 
The quality of produced parts is highly dependent on the proper selection of processing parameters , requiring significant testing and experimentation to determine parameters for a given machine and material . 
Computational modeling could potentially be used to shorten this process by identifying parameters through simulation . 
However , simulating complete SLM builds is challenging due to the difference in scale between the size of the particles and laser used in the build and the size of the part produced . 
Often , continuum models are employed which approximate the powder as a continuous medium to avoid the need to model powder particles individually . 
While computationally expedient , continuum models require as inputs effective material properties for the powder which are often difficult to obtain experimentally . 
Building on previous works which have developed methods for estimating these effective properties along with their uncertainties through the use of detailed models , this work presents a part scale continuum model capable of predicting residual thermal stresses in an SLM build with uncertainty estimates . 
Model predictions are compared to experimental measurements from the literature . 
Processing of high-speed steel by SLM was successfully performed with low porosity . 
Preheating temperatures of 200 °C or 300 °C are necessary for low crack density . 
Microstructure consists of a cellular , fine dendritic structure after SLM . 
Hardness tempering behavior of the SLM-densified material is promising . 
The tribological properties of SLM specimens are highly promising compared to the references . 
In this work , the influence of different manufacturing techniques of M3:2 high-speed steel on the resulting microstructure and the associated material properties was investigated . 
Therefore , microstructure as well as the mechanical and tribological properties of cast steel ( with subsequent hot-forming ) and steel powder processed by two techniques : hot-isostatic pressing ( HIP ) and selective laser melting ( SLM ) were compared . 
A detailed SLM parameter analysis revealed that the porosity of SLM specimens can be decreased towards a smaller point distance and a longer exposure time ( high energy input ) . 
A rise in preheating temperature is associated with a reduction in the crack density or the complete avoidance of cracks . 
In this context , the high-speed steel showed outstanding densification behavior by SLM , even though this steel is considered to be hardly processable by SLM due to its high content of carbon and hard phase-forming elements . 
In addition , the reusability of steel powder for SLM processing was investigated . 
The results indicated that multiple reuse is possible , but only in combination with powder processing ( mechanical sieving ) after each SLM cycle . 
The microstructure of SLM-densified high-speed steel consists of a cellular , fine dendritic subgrain segregation structure ( submicro level ) that is not significantly affected by preheating the base plate . 
The mechanical and tribological properties were examined in relation to the manufacturing technique and the subsequent heat treatment . 
Our investigations revealed promising behavior with respect to hardness tempering ( position of the secondary hardness peak ) and tribology of the M3:2 steel processed by SLM compared to the HIP and cast conditions . 
A hybrid-part made of two materials was fabricated by selective laser melting ( SLM ) of AlSi10Mg on an Al-Cu-Ni-Fe-Mg cast alloy substrate . 
The microstructure of the two-material component and the interface is investigated using multi-scale characterization techniques including optical microscopy ( OM ) , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , electron backscatter diffraction ( EBSD ) , and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . 
The microstructure of SLM-AlSi10Mg consists of fine cellular dendrites and columnar grains , developed along the building direction , where the substrate cast alloy is featured by large equiaxed grains . 
OM and SEM studies of the interface show a sound metallurgical bonding as a result of the melting of AlSi10Mg powder and partial melting of the cast substrate assisted by the circulate flows and Marangoni convection . 
The circulate flows cause complex phenomena at the interface , which lead to the dilution of alloying elements and a variation in the microstructure of the first consolidated layer of SLM-AlSi10Mg ( as a result of variation in thermal gradient and solidification rate ) . 
TEM investigations of the interface reveal segregation of alloying elements at the interdendritic regions after solidification . 
Moreover , no precipitate is formed on top of the interface , due to the rapid solidification and dilution of the alloying elements . 
EBSD analysis of the interface shows substantial differences in the grain structure of SLM-AlSi10Mg and the cast substrate , in terms of size and morphology . 
Mechanical properties of the hybrid material are studied afterwards using Vickers microhardness measurements , nanoindentation and quasi-static uniaxial tensile tests . 
The SLM-AlSi10Mg side of the hybrid-part possesses better performance , mainly due to its finer and hierarchical microstructure . 
Inkjet printing of multiple materials is usually processed in multiple steps due to various jetting and curing/sintering conditions . 
The ink consists of iron oxide ( Fe3O4 ) nanoparticles ( nominal particle size 50–100 nm ) suspended within a UV curable matrix resin . 
The viscosity and surface tension of the inks were tuned to sit within the inkjet printability range.Multiple layers of the electromagnetic active ink were printed alongside passive UV-curable ink in a single manufacturing process to form a multi-material waffle shape . 
The real permittivity of the cured passive ink , active ink and waffle structure at a frequency of 8–12 GHz were 2.25 , 2.73 and 2.65 F/m , respectively . 
This shows the potential of additive manufacturing ( AM ) to form multi-material structures with tunable electromagnetic properties . 
A side-viewing vision monitoring methodology using high-speed camera for powder bed fusion process is proposed . 
A novel method is designed to extract features from melt pool , plume and spatters . 
The characteristics of the features of melt pool , plume and spatters are investigated . 
The results demonstrated that the extracted features are potential indicators for process quality assessment . 
With the development of powder bed fusion ( PBF ) additive manufacturing technique for functional parts production , process monitoring and diagnosis is highly demanded to ensure its process reliability and repeatability . 
An optical filter with 350 nm–800 nm cut-off was used to enhance the image contrast between the plume and the melt pool . 
A new image processing method was designed to extract features from the melt pool , plume and spatters , respectively . 
Kalman filter tracking was used to pinpoint the exact melt pool position , and image segmentation algorithm was developed to segment the melt pool , plume and spatters from each other ; a new tracking method was utilized to remove the spatters generated in the previous frame . 
After image processing , the features of melt pool intensity , plume area , plume orientation , spatter number , spatter area , spatter orientation and spatter velocity were extracted and their correlations with the scanning quality were investigated . 
The results indicated that these features were potential indicators for scanning quality assessment . 
The proposed method could be used to further study the characteristics of plume and spatter and to explore the diagnosis performance based on the fusion of melt pool , plume and spatter information . 
It provides a promising means for in-situ monitoring and control of PBF process . 
This paper presents the computational fluid dynamics modeling of an additive manufacturing process that is candidate for the production of Gen IV nuclear reactor fuels . 
The modeled process combines the internal gelation to produce metal hydrous oxides with the 3D ceramic printing to create a green body from these gelled oxides as described by Pouchon ( 2016 ) . 
The objective of the simulations is to optimize the process parameters : microfluidic mixing of the internal gelation reagents and generation of droplets of the mixed solutions . 
The simulations were performed using the OpenFOAM software , and to perform these simulations with the correct solution parameters , the properties of the fluids of interest were measured . 
The results show that a thorough mixing of the metal solution and the methenamine and urea mixture in a microfluidic mixer can be achieved in tens of milliseconds by either winding the mixing channel to create secondary flows or splitting the solutions inlets to yield additional diffusion interfaces . 
The optimal droplet size is achieved by using a mechanically vibrating 3D printing head that leads to a frequency-following Rayleigh instability . 
The results of the simulations suggest the parameters ( micromixer geometry , flow rate , vibration frequency and others ) that will optimize the mixing efficiency in a microfluidic mixer and the droplet generation process from a 3D printing head . 
Metal Laser Sintering ( LS ) is a powder bed fusion process that can be used to produce manufactured parts of complex shapes directly from metallic powders . 
One of the major problems of such powder bed fusion processes is that during the continuous movement of the laser beam , temperature distribution becomes inhomogeneous and instable in the powder . 
It leads to greater residual stresses in the solidified layer . 
Thus , temperature analyses must be performed to better understand the heating-cooling process of the powder bed as well as the interactions of different laser scanning paths within a sintering pattern . 
A transient 3D Finite Element ( FE ) model of the LS process has been developed with the commercial FE code ABAQUS . 
The model takes into account the different physical phenomena involved in this powder bed fusion technology ( including thermal conduction , radiation and convection ) . 
A moving thermal source , modeling the laser scan , is implemented with the user scripting subroutine DFLUX in this FE code . 
The material ’ s thermal behavior is also defined via the subroutine UMATHT . 
As the material properties change due to the powder bed fusion process , the model takes it into account . 
In this way , the calculation of a temperature-dependent behavior is undertaken for the packed powder bed , within its effective thermal conductivity and specific heat . 
Furthermore , the model accounts for the latent heat due to phase change of the metal powder . 
Finally , a time- and temperature-dependent formulation for the material ’ s density is also computed , which is then integrated along with the other thermal properties in the heat equation . 
FE simulations have been applied to the case of titanium powder and show predictions in good agreement with experimental results . 
The effects of process parameters on the temperature and on the density distribution are also presented . 
The lattice structure is a type of cellular material that can achieve a variety of promising physical properties . 
Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) has relieved the difficulty of fabricating lattice structures with complex geometries . 
However , the quality of the AM fabricated lattice structure still needs improvement . 
In this paper , the influence of parameters of the Fused Deposition Modeling ( FDM ) process on lattice structures was investigated by the Taguchi method . 
It was found that the optimum level and significance of each process parameter vary for horizontal and inclined struts . 
In addition , compression tests investigate the influence of process parameters on the mechanical properties of lattice structures . 
The results show that process parameters optimized by print quality can also improve the elastic modulus and the ultimate strength of these lattice structures . 
Laser cladding induces high tensile residual stress ( RS ) , which can compromise the quality of a specimen . 
Therefore , it is critical to accurately predict the RS distribution in cladding and understand its formation mechanism . 
In this study , functionally graded material ( FGM ) layers were successfully deposited on the surface of a titanium alloy Ti6Al4V sheet by laser cladding technology . 
A corresponding thermo-mechanical coupling simulation model of the laser cladding process was developed to investigate the formation mechanism of RS in the laser cladding FGM layers . 
The results show that high tensile RS forms in cladding components . 
Subsequent cladding can effectively alleviate the RS in cladding components although the position of maximum RS remains unchanged . 
The measurement results of the longitudinal RS on the top and bottom surfaces of cladding components by the X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) method agreed with the simulation results , thereby proving the accuracy of the simulation . 
In addition , the formation mechanism of RS in the laser cladding FGM layers was revealed by discussing the individual impact of each material property on RS . 
It was indicated that the RS distribution in the laser cladding FGM layers was significantly affected by material properties ( in particular , coefficient of thermal expansion and Young ’ s modulus ) , except for the temperature gradient induced by the laser cladding process . 
The material extrusion additive manufacturing process , i.e. 
, fused deposition modeling ( FDM ) , as opposed to traditional subtractive manufacturing , offers a superior way of manufacturing tooling components in terms of great design flexibility , rapid tooling development , material requirement reduction and significant cost savings . 
However , it is always challenging to design a tool structure with minimized material and labor cost while maintaining satisfactory tooling performance . 
In the current study , a comprehensive finite element model was developed for ULTEM 9085 FDM tools subjected to applied pressure and elevated temperature for vacuum assisted resin transfer molding ( VARTM ) process . 
Both solid-build and sparse-build tools were studied . 
Material properties of the tools were obtained from solid coupon testing at elevated temperatures . 
The thermo-mechanical behavior of tools during the VARTM process was investigated using the finite element model . 
The ULTEM tools were manufactured using Stratasys Fortus 400mc FDM machine . 
Thermal cycling of the tools was performed at elevated temperatures ( 180 °F and 250 °F ) . 
Dimensional analysis and surface roughness of the tools were evaluated after thermal cycling . 
This study on the performance of FDM tooling for VARTM composite manufacturing process can be extended to other composite manufacturing processes . 
The low alloy steel AISI 4140 ( German grade 42CrMo4 ) is one of the most frequently used Quench & Tempering ( Q & T ) steels with a wide range of applicability . 
Until now , commercially available iron powders for additive manufacturing can be summed up by their low amount of carbon . 
Fusion welding of Q & T steels often leads to cracks due to brittle martensitic transformation and the associated volume change . 
Therefore , the selection of appropriate process parameters in laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) plays a key role for the final material properties and is achieved through utilization of a new process development strategy and evaluation of microstructural features of test cubes . 
In this work tensile specimens were successfully produced with optimal process parameters and mechanical tests of additively built samples indicate mechanical performance comparable with a 450 °C tempered state of conventionally cast material . 
By correlating the measured mechanical properties of LPBF samples to those of a conventional Q & T state , an estimation of the intrinsic heat treatment during LPBF was carried out using an inverse transient Hollomon–Jaffe approach . 
This is also in accordance with the finely dispersed carbide precipitates in the as built condition . 
Furthermore , the effect of bed pre-heating on the final material tempering state was found to be negligible . 
This shows the importance of a balanced match between LPBF process parameters and subsequent application demands as well as necessary postprocessing steps . 
Alumina toughened zirconia ( ATZ ) parts were produced via a laser-based powder bed fusion technology using a conventional Nd-YAG continuous wave laser . 
The powder was produced using a spray drying process and the laser matter interaction was enhanced by a binder pyrolysis . 
Thermal post-processing to further increase the part density was investigated using dilatometry . 
The microstructure was analysed using X-ray powder diffraction measurements . 
The mechanical properties were assessed using a four-point bending test on ten specimens , reaching a bending strength of 31 ± 11 MPa . 
Laser-based direct metal addition ( LBDMA ) is a promising directed energy deposition technology that is well suited for the production of complex metal structures , low-volume manufacturing , and high-value component repair or modification . 
LBDMA is finding wide application in the automotive , biomedical , and aerospace industries . 
However , the process reliability and the repeatability of finished components are still problems . 
This work offers a solution by developing a sensing and control system for the robotically controlled 8-axis LBDMA system developed at the Research Center for Advanced Manufacturing of Southern Methodist University , Dallas , TX . 
The developed system consists of sensing and control units for the powder flow rate and the molten pool size . 
An optoelectronic sensor was developed to sense the powder flow rate . 
It is a main component in an on-line control system of powder flow rate in a LBDMA system . 
An infrared imaging setup was installed on the laser head to monitor the top full-field view of the molten pool . 
A simple proportional integral derivative ( PID ) controller , combined with feed-forward compensation was used to build a closed-loop control system for achieving a uniform molten pool size . 
Two L-shaped single-bead walls were built with and without closed-loop control , respectively . 
A good performance on achieving uniform geometry by closed-loop control of the molten pool size was approved . 
Selective laser sintering ( LS ) of thermoplastic powders allows for the construction of complex parts with higher mechanical properties and durability compared to other additive manufacturing methods . 
According to the current model of isothermal laser sintering , semi-crystalline thermoplastics need to be processed within a certain temperature range , resulting in the simultaneous presence of the material both in a molten and solid state , which is present during part building . 
Based on this process model , high cycle times ranging from hours to days are a thought to be a necessity to avoid warpage.In this paper , the limited validity of the model of isothermal laser sintering is shown by various experiments , as ongoing solidification could be detected a few layers below the powder bed surface . 
The results indicate that crystallization and material solidification is initiated at high temperatures and further progresses throughout part build-up in z-direction . 
Therefore , a process-adapted material characterization was performed to identify the isothermal crystallization kinetics at processing temperature and to track changes of the material state over time . 
A dual approach on measuring surface temperatures by infrared thermography and additional thermocouple measurements in z-direction was performed to identify further influences on the material solidification . 
A model experiment revealed that a few millimeters below the surface , components produced by LS are already solidified . 
Based on these results , the authors present an enhanced process model of isothermal laser sintering , which considers material solidification in z-direction during part build-up . 
Additive manufacturing ( 3D printing ) enables the designing and producing of complex geometries in a layer-by-layer approach . 
The layered structure leads to anisotropic behaviour in the material . 
To accommodate anisotropic behaviour , geometrical optimization is needed so that the 3D printed object meets the pre-set strength and quality requirements . 
In this article a material description for polymer powder bed fused also or selective laser sintered ( SLS ) PA12 ( Nylon-12 ) , which is a common 3D printing plastic , was investigated , using the Finite Element Method ( FEM ) . 
The Material Model parameters were obtained by matching them to the test results of multipurpose test specimens ( dumb-bells or dog bones ) and the model was then used to simulate/predict the mechanical performance of the SLS printed lower-leg prosthesis components , pylon and support . 
For verification purposes , two FEM designs for a support were SLS printed together with additional test specimens in order to validate the used Material Model . 
The SLS printed prosthesis pieces were tested according to ISO 10328 Standard . 
The FEM simulations , together with the Material Model , was found to give good estimations for the location of a failure and its load . 
It was also noted that there were significant variations among individual SLS printed test specimens , which impacted on the material parameters and the FEM simulations . 
Hence , to enable reliable FEM simulations for the designing of 3D printed products , better control of the SLS process with regards to porosity , pore morphology and pore distribution is needed . 
Water-atomized and gas-atomized 17-4 PH stainless steel powder were used as feedstock in selective laser melting process . 
Gas atomized powder revealed single martensitic phase after printing and heat treatment independent of energy density . 
As-printed water atomized powder contained dual martensitic and austenitic phase regardless of energy density . 
The H900 heat treatment cycle was not effective in enhancing mechanical properties of the water-atomized powder after laser melting . 
However , after solutionizing at 1315ºC and aging at 482 °C fully martensitic structure was observed with hardness ( 40.2 HRC ) , yield strength ( 1000 MPa ) and ultimate tensile strength ( 1261 MPa ) comparable to those of gas atomized ( 42.7 HRC , 1254 MPa and 1300 MPa ) and wrought alloy ( 39 HRC , 1170 MPa and 1310 MPa ) , respectively . 
Improved mechanical properties in water-atomized powder was found to be related to presence of finer martensite and higher volume fraction of fine Cu-enriched precipitates . 
Our results imply that water-atomized powder is a promising cheaper feedstock alternative to gas-atomized powder . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) technologies offer new processing routes for functionally graded materials . 
At present , parts built using these processes often require additional processing as a result of the characteristic surface finish limitations synonymous with AM processes . 
A difficulty thus arises in the post processing of these components as volumes within the part have differing material properties by definition and will therefore exhibit variable machinability.In this study , machining of functionally graded Ti6Al4V/ WC components consisting of a metal matrix composite ( MMC ) region and a single alloy region produced via direct energy deposition using commercially available tooling is explored . 
The influence of post processing on surface integrity is investigated and reported . 
The effect of material variation on cutting forces and tool response along the component is also analysed and reported . 
Cutting forces within the MMC region are found to increase by as much as 40 % which has been subsequently related to the periodic changes in microstructure generated by the layer by layer build strategy . 
Tool wear mechanisms are investigated and the influence of material pull out on surface integrity of both MMC and single material regions is explored . 
This study provides an insight into how the layer building strategies , particularly with multiple materials and the resulting variation in microstructure influences the machining of resulting components . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) is gaining popularity because of its ability to manufacture complex parts in less time . 
Despite recent research involving designs of experiments ( DOEs ) to characterize the relationships between some AM process parameters and various part quality characteristics , to date , there seems to be no universally accepted comprehensive model that relates process parameters to part quality . 
In this paper , to support the goal of manufacturing parts right the first time , a Bayesian network in continuous domain is developed which relates four process parameters ( laser power , scan speed , hatch spacing , and layer thickness ) and five part quality characteristics ( density , hardness , top layer surface roughness , ultimate tensile strength in the build direction and ultimate tensile strength perpendicular to the build direction ) . 
A machine learning algorithm is used to train the network on a database mined from a large number of publications with experimental data from parts built using 316L with selective laser melting . 
The network is validated by retaining a subset of the training data for testing and comparing the network ’ s predictions to the known values . 
Accuracy is optimized by continually re-training the network using parts built with a specific machine of interest . 
The industrial relevance of this research is outlined with respect to four current challenges in AM , including the length of time to determine optimal process parameters for a new machine , ability to organize relevant knowledge , quantification of machine variability , and transfer of knowledge to new operators . 
Reclaimed materials such as waste plastics can be utilized in additive manufacturing to improve the self-reliance of warfighters on forward operating bases by cutting costs and decreasing the demand for the frequent resupplying of parts by the supply chain . 
In addition , the use of waste materials in additive manufacturing in the private sector would reduce cost and increase sustainability , providing a high-value output for used plastics . 
Experimentation is conducted to process polyethylene terephthalate bottles and packaging into filament that can then be used for additive manufacturing methods like fused filament fabrication , without the use of additives or modification to the polymer . 
The chemistry of different polyethylene terephthalate recycled feedstocks was evaluated and found to be identical , and thus mixed feedstock processing is a suitable approach . 
Rheological data showed drying of the recycled polyethylene terephthalate led to an increase in the polymer ’ s viscosity . 
Thermal and mechanical properties were evaluated for filament with different processing conditions , as well as printed and molded specimens . 
Crystallinity ranged from 12.2 for the water cooled filament , compared to 24.9 % for the filament without any active cooling . 
Tensile results show that the elongation to failure was similar to an injection molded part ( 3.5 % ) and tensile strength of 35.1 ± 8 MPa was comparable to commercial polycarbonate-ABS filament , demonstrating the robustness of the material . 
In addition , three point bending tests showed a similar load at failure for a select long-lead military part printed from the recycled filament compared to parts printed from commercial filament . 
Thus filament from recycled polyethylene terephthalate has the capability for replacing commercial filament in printing a diverse range of plastic parts . 
The incorporation of electrical components into 3D printed products such as sensors or printing of circuits requires the use of 3D printable conductive materials . 
However , most conductive materials available for fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) have conductivities of less than 1000 S/m . 
Here , we describe the study of conductive thermoplastic composites comprising either nylon – 6 or polyethylene ( PE ) matrix . 
The fillers used were nickel and Sn95Ag4Cu1 , a low melting point metal alloy . 
The combination of nickel metal particles and tin alloy allows for higher metal loading at lower melt viscosity , compared to composites of nickel metal particles alone . 
% metal loading was processable by a single screw extruder . 
Embedded conductive tracks of various geometries were easily printed via FFF . 
Electrical conductivity of embedded conductive track has been investigated as a function of geometrical variation , where conductive tracks printed along a horizontal axis show resistance of ≤ 1 Ω. Porosity of the printed track is shown to increase with prints along the vertical axis , leading to a reduction in electrical conductivity of more than two orders of magnitude . 
Rapid melt pool formation and solidification during the metal powder bed process Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) generates large thermal gradients that can in turn lead to increased residual stress formation within a component . 
Metal anchors or supports are required to be built in-situ and forcibly hold SLM structures in place and minimise geometric distortion/warpage as a result of this thermal residual stress . 
Anchors are often costly , difficult and time consuming to remove and limit the geometric freedom of this Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) process . 
A novel method known as Anchorless Selective Laser Melting ( ASLM ) maintains processed material within a stress relieved state throughout the duration of a build . 
As a result metal components formed using ASLM do not require support structures or anchors . 
ASLM locally melts two or more powdered materials that alloy under the action of the laser and can form into various combinations of eutectic/hypo/hyper eutectic alloys with a new lower solidification temperature . 
This new alloy is maintained in a semi-solid or stress reduced state throughout the build with the assistance of elevated powder bed pre-heating . 
In this paper the ASLM methodology is detailed and investigations into processing of a low temperature eutectic Al-Si binary casting alloy is explored . 
Two types of Al powders were compared ; pre-alloyed AlSi12 and elemental mix Al + 12 wt % Si . 
The study established an understanding of the laser in-situ alloying process and confirmed successful alloy formation within the process . 
Differential thermal analysis , microscopy and X-Ray diffraction were used to further understand the nature of alloying within the process . 
Residual stress reduction was observed within ASLM processed elemental Al + Si12 and geometries produced without the requirement for anchors . 
Heterogeneous grain structure is a source of the inhomogeneity in structure and properties of the metallic components made by multi-layer additive manufacturing ( AM ) . 
During AM , repeated heating and cooling during multi-layer deposition , local temperature gradient and solidification growth rate , deposit geometry , and molten pool shape and size govern the evolution of the grain structure . 
Here the effects of these causative factors on the heterogeneous grain growth during multi-layer laser deposition of Inconel 718 are examined by a Monte Carlo method based grain growth model . 
It is found that epitaxial columnar grain growth occurs from the substrate or previously deposited layer to the curved top surface of the deposit . 
The growth direction of these columnar grains is controlled by the molten pool shape and size . 
The grains in the previously deposited layers continue to grow because of the repeated heating and cooling during the deposition of the successive layers . 
Average longitudinal grain area decreases by approximately 80 % when moving from the center to the edge of the deposit due to variable growth directions dependent on the local curvatures of the moving molten pool . 
The average horizontal grain area increases with the distance from the substrate , with a 20 % increase in the horizontal grain area in a short distance from the third to the eighth layer , due to competitive solid-state grain growth causes increased grain size in previous layers . 
Powder quality in additive manufacturing ( AM ) electron beam melting ( EBM ) of Ti-6Al-4V components is crucial in determining the critical material properties of the end item . 
In this study , we report on the effect of powder oxidation on the Charpy impact energy of Ti-6Al-4V parts manufactured using EBM . 
In addition to oxidation , the effects on impact energy due to hot isostatic pressing ( HIP ) , specimen orientation , and EBM process defects were also investigated . 
This research has shown that excessive powder oxidation ( oxygen mass fraction above 0.25 % and up to 0.46 % ) dramatically decreases the impact energy . 
It was determined that the room temperature impact energy of the parts after excessive oxidation was reduced by about seven times . 
We also report that HIP post-processing significantly increases the impact toughness , especially for specimens with lower or normal oxygen content . 
The specimen orientation effect was found to be more significant for low oxidation levels . 
Material extrusion 3D printing ( ME3DP ) , based on fused deposition modeling ( FDM ) technology is currently the most widely available 3D printing platform . 
As is the case with other 3D printing methods , parts fabricated from ME3DP will exhibit physical property anisotropy where build direction has an effect on the mechanical properties of a given part . 
The work presented in this paper analyzes the effect of physical property-altering additives to acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS ) on mechanical property anisotropy . 
A total of six ABS-based polymer matrix composites and four polymer blends were created and evaluated . 
Tensile test specimens were printed in two build orientations and the differences in ultimate tensile strength and % elongation at break were compared between the two test sample versions . 
Fracture surface analysis was performed via scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) which gave insight to the failure modes and rheology of the novel material systems as compared to specimens fabricated from the same ABS base resin . 
Here it was found that a ternary blend of ABS combined with styrene ethylene butadiene styrene ( SEBS ) and ultra high molecular weight polyethylene ( UHMWPE ) lowered the mechanical property anisotropy in terms of relative UTS to a difference of 22 ± 2.07 % as compared to 47 ± 7.23 % for samples printed from ABS . 
The work here demonstrates the mitigation of a problem associated with 3D printing as a whole through novel materials development and analyzes the effects of adding a wide variety of materials on the physical properties of a thermoplastic base resin . 
Moisture affects the flow behavior of AM metal powders , where AlSi10Mg is the most sensitive to water and oxygen pick up . 
The powder morphology influences to a large extent the moisture pick up and flow behavior . 
The flowability measured with traditional tools is not representative for powder bed fusion processes . 
Two new flowability tools that mimic the powder spreading mechanism of powder bed fusion systems are proposed and tested . 
Air drying and vacuum drying treatments to remove the moisture prior to the build process are investigated . 
For AM processes—specifically Laser Powder Bed Fusion ( L-PBF ) processes—powder flowability is essential for the product quality , as these processes are based on a thin layer spreading mechanism . 
However , the available techniques to measure this flowability do not accurately represent the spreading mechanism . 
Hence , this paper presents two novel applicator tools specifically designed to test the spreadability of l-PBF powders in thin layer application . 
The results were checked by running standard tests to analyze the powder morphology , moisture content , chemical composition and flowability using the Hall-flowmeter . 
For this study , four common l-PBF metal powders were selected : Inconel 718 , Ti6Al4V , AlSi10Mg and Scalmalloy . 
From the as-received state , drying ( vacuum and air ) and moisturizing treatments were applied to compare four humidity states and investigate the feasibility of pre-treating the powders to remove moisture , which is known to cause problems with flowability , porosity formation and enhanced oxidation . 
The tests reveal that AlSi10Mg is the most susceptible alloy to moisture and oxygen pick-up , considerably decreasing the spreadability and relative density on the build platform . 
However , the results also reveal how challenging the direct measurement of moisture levels in metal powders is . 
Therefore , lightweight is paramount.Here , a lightweight electromagnetic actuator for HHBs is conceived using Design for Additive Manufacturing ( DfAM ) tools , including topology optimization and free-shape design . 
A prototype is manufactured by selective laser melting ( SLM ) of alloy Ti-6Al-4V . 
The prototype weighs 25 % less than the actuator designed and manufactured using traditional methods ( i.e . 
CAD , milling ) and materials ( i.e . 
Al alloys ) . 
The performance of the actuator in service is simulated by transient modal mechanical analyses using finite element methods . 
The results show that the high strength of the material selected , combined with the bionic geometry designed and the resulting lightweight , allow the actuator to withstand the extreme accelerations of the HHB ( 3000 g ) without yielding , enabling ultra-fast switching –namely , below 1 ms . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) is an additive manufacturing process in which multiple , successive layers of metal powders are heated via laser in order to build a part . 
Modeling of SLM requires consideration of the complex interaction between heat transfer and solid mechanics . 
The present work describes the authors initial efforts to validate their first generation model , as described in Hodge et al . 
Additionally , results of various perturbations of the process parameters and modeling strategies are discussed . 
Density , surface roughness and mechanical properties of printed AlSi10Mg parts depend strongly on the manufacturing process of the used powder . 
The plasma atomized powder used in this study enables higher scanning speeds and thus a more efficient LPBF process than gas atomized powder . 
The measurement of the laser absorption is very sensitive to variations of the powder and reveals a clear correlation to the final part densities . 
The present paper aims to generate a deeper understanding of the influence of powder properties on the final parts manufactured by metal LPBF processes at constant parameter settings , except the hatch scanning speed . 
This issue was considered using four different AlSi10Mg powders.In addition to particle properties , such as particle size distribution and morphology , typical properties of the powder feedstock like bulk and tapped density , Hausner-Ratio , flowability and laser absorption were measured . 
Furthermore , the in situ density of the powder layers applied during the LPBF process were analyzed . 
A comparison of the surface quality , part density and mechanical properties of AlSi10Mg parts produced by LPBF , using different particle size distributions and morphologies , has been conducted . 
Within the processing experiments , the laser scanning speed was varied in order to achieve the most economical manufacturing of parts with a density > 99.2 % .Following this comparison , it was found that the manufacturing process of the powder and therefore the particle morphology has the biggest impact on the part density and surface quality . 
The considered plasma atomized powder could be processed at a higher scanning speed without a significant decrease in mechanical properties or part density . 
Generally , it was shown that higher densities of the powder layer result in higher part densities . 
However , the layer densities for powders which show almost the same bulk density can differ significantly and do not reach the regarding bulk density value . 
Therefore it can be stated that the layer density is not only affected by the bulk density . 
In terms of surface quality , the investigated plasma atomized powder provides a significantly lower surface roughness.Moreover , it was found that the measurement of the laser absorption shows a strong correlation to the achievable part densities . 
In contrast to the other methods performed , it was the only measurement that is very sensitive even to small variations of the powder and enables an unequivocal differentiation of the examined powders . 
Additive Manufacturing offers many potential benefits including reduced tooling costs and increased geometric freedom . 
However , the surface quality of the parts is typically below that of conventionally-processed materials . 
This paper evaluates a new chemical post-processing method to reduce the roughness of laser-sintered Nylon 12 components . 
This process is called the PUSh™ process . 
The treatment reduced the surface roughness of sample parts from 18 μm to 5 μm Ra and largely eliminated roughness with length scales below 500 μm . 
Treatment did not affect the flexural modulus , flexural strength , or dimensions of 3.2 mm thick bending specimens , but it did significantly impact the mechanical properties of thin tensile specimens that are one to eight layers thick . 
The post processing reduced the breaking force of the samples , but it increased the ultimate tensile strength and elongation at break . 
The impact was largest on the thinnest parts . 
Significant sample shrinkage ( 12–20 % ) and weight gain ( 3.7–7 % ) from treatment was also observed in the tensile specimens . 
The results show that the PUSh™ process dramatically increases surface smoothness and elongation at break in thin specimens . 
It decreases the surface strength , but effects are negligible in larger samples . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) has emerged as one of the primary metal additive manufacturing technologies used for many applications in various industries such as medical and aerospace sectors . 
However , defects such as part distortion and delamination resulted from process-induced residual stresses are still one of the key challenges that hinder widespread adoptions of SLM . 
For process parameters , the laser beam scanning path will affect the thermomechanical behaviors of the build part , and thus , altering the scanning pattern may be a possible strategy to reduce residual stresses and deformations through influencing the heat intensity input distributions . 
In this study , a 3D sequentially coupled finite element ( FE ) model was developed to investigate the thermomechanical responses in the SLM process . 
The model was applied to test different scanning strategies and evaluate their effects on part temperature , stress and deformation . 
The major results are summarized as follows . 
( 1 ) Among all cases tested , the out-in scanning pattern has the maximum stresses along the X and Y directions ; while the 45° inclined line scanning may reduce residual stresses in both directions . 
( 2 ) Large directional stress differences can be generated by the horizontal line scanning strategy . 
( 3 ) X and Y directional stress concentrations are shown around the edge of the deposited layers and the interface between the deposited layers and the substrate for all cases . 
( 4 ) The 45° inclined line scanning case also has a smaller build direction deformation than other cases . 
Directed Energy Deposition ( DED ) was used to form a Stainless Steel AISI 316 L steel block component on a Mild Steel S235JR substrate . 
Porosity , density , and defect were characterised at 4 localities within the DED component by microscopy and x-ray tomography . 
Three-dimensional ( 3D ) reconstruction of the x-ray tomographic image sequences focused at select porosities is presented . 
The element composition and Vickers microhardness measurements were taken at the fusion lines and track body locations to characterise the differences in materials and mechanical properties at the 2 locations . 
Lastly , an element mapping analysis was conducted to determine the solidification mode for the DED component . 
Sources for defects were proposed based on the characteristics of the porosity analysis and conclusions were made about the solidification behaviour of the DED component . 
Laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) was applied in this study to produce a prototype of a miniaturized catalytic burner ( CAB ) , which is a key component of high-temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells . 
This prototype was characterized by its complex design with numerous channels , chambers , and thin walls . 
The test samples and CAB prototype were made of a heat-resistant , anti-corrodible steel called `` Alloy 800H '' ( 1.4876 ) , a material that poses problems for welding operations and especially for the LPBF process due to its strong susceptibility to hot cracking and spatters . 
The effects of LPBF parameter variation on preliminary test samples were investigated by nano-focus Computed Tomography ( CT ) and Optical microscopy to clarify the internal structure and defects for further LPBF process optimization . 
Mössbauer spectroscopy points out that LPBF process does not lead to either local phase separation nor oxidation of steel , which is critical factor for use of CAB at high temperatures . 
The sufficient LPBF parameter sets were used to manufacture the CAB prototype , which was examined by micro-CT and optics as well . 
The main result of the investigation is a demonstration of the technological feasibility to decrease the number and size of defects in complex LPBF-manufactured Alloy 800H constructions without changes in phase composition at high temperatures . 
A multi-component and multi-phase-field modelling approach , combined with transformation kinetics modelling , was used to model microstructure evolution during laser metal powder directed energy deposition of Alloy 718 and subsequent heat treatments . 
Experimental temperature measurements were utilised to predict microstructural evolution during successive addition of layers . 
Segregation of alloying elements as well as formation of Laves and δ phase was specifically modelled . 
The predicted elemental concentrations were then used in transformation kinetics to estimate changes in Continuous Cooling Transformation ( CCT ) and Time Temperature Transformation ( TTT ) diagrams for Alloy 718 . 
Modelling results showed good agreement with experimentally observed phase evolution within the microstructure . 
The results indicate that the approach can be a valuable tool , both for improving process understanding and for process development including subsequent heat treatment . 
Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) is a widely used Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) technique . 
Recently , mechanical properties of plastic FFF parts have been enhanced by adding short carbon fibers to the thermoplastic polymer filament to form a carbon fiber filled ( CFF ) polymer composite . 
Unfortunately , improvements to the material properties of commercially available CFF filament are not well understood . 
This paper presents a study of CFF FFF parts produced on desktop 3D printers using commercially available filament . 
Tensile test samples fabricated with CFF polymer composite and unfilled polymer were printed and then tested following ASTM D3039M . 
The filament considered here was purchased from filament suppliers and included both CFF and unfilled PLA , ABS , PETG and Amphora . 
Results for tensile strength and tensile modulus show that CFF coupons in general yield higher tensile modulus at all print orientations and higher tensile strength at 0 ° print orientation . 
The addition of carbon fiber was shown to decrease tensile strength for some materials when printed with beads not aligned with the loading direction . 
Additionally , CFF samples are evaluated for fiber length distribution ( FLD ) and fiber weight fraction , where it was found that the filament extrusion process contributes very little to fiber breakage . 
Finally , fracture surfaces evaluated under SEM show that voids between the beads are reduced with CFF coupons , and poor interfacial bonding between fibers and polymer become a prominent failure mechanism . 
Three-dimensional ( 3D ) printing , or additive manufacturing , has been increasingly used in many fields , including the medicine , food , sensing , metal , automotive , and construction industries . 
Regardless of its growing applications , there are few of methods , guidelines , and specifications for measuring and quantifying the qualities of 3D printed objects . 
In this study , for the first time , a non-contact , and non-destructive measurement method , a 3D structured light scanning system ( 3D-SLSS ) , was employed for evaluating the printing qualities of clay objects with different levels of visual defects ( e.g. 
, roughness and distortion ) . 
3D scanned images of these clay samples were developed using 3D-SLSS . 
Then , they were sliced along their sides ( perpendicular to the base ) to generate a number of two-dimensional ( 2D ) plots , from which various parameters ( e.g. 
, sample total height [ Htotal ] , outer diameter [ DMouter ] , layer thickness [ TL ] , layer width , [ ( WL ] , surface angle [ Sα ] , semi-cross-sectional area [ XA ] , and surface roughness [ R ] ) were measured . 
Compared with the designed object , the printed samples generally had reduced total height , diameter , and layer thickness ; increased layer width ; measurable distortion ; and visible surface roughness . 
Many of these were largely because the freshly printed clay deformed under the weight of the layers above . 
The distortion angle and area are two necessary parameters for quantifying the degree of distortion of a printed sample . 
The diagnosed area of deficiency can well describe the overall qualities of the printed samples . 
Moreover , it can be conveniently extended to various industries for quality control of diverse 3D printing products . 
TiB reinforced near α Ti-matrix composite was fabricated in this work using selective laser melting from a mixture of CrB2 and commercially pure Ti powders . 
The corresponding composites present an almost fully dense structure for suitable laser energy density conditions . 
The X-ray diffraction and microstructure analysis indicate that the TiB and β-Ti phase appears for parts obtained with a low scanning speed of the laser beam . 
The parts obtained at high and low scanning speeds show higher hardness and lower wear rate than those obtained for intermediate scanning speed which , on the contrary , show the highest density . 
The wear behavior of the as-processed parts is compared with that of pure Ti parts also obtained by selective laser melting . 
Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) is a popular additive manufacturing technique where molten polymer filament is applied in a raster pattern , layer by layer , to obtain the work piece . 
A necessary consequence of this method is a pronounced mechanical anisotropy of the product ; the interface between the filaments is weaker compared to the filament itself . 
The strength of this interface is governed by the reptation theory which postulates a more efficient interpenetration of polymeric surfaces with decreasing polymer viscosity . 
This relationship was utilized in this work to modify a polycarbonate-acrylonitrile butadiene styrene polymer blend to produce FFF work pieces with less mechanical anisotropy , independent of printer settings . 
The tensile strength ratio of the printed interface to bulk tensile strength could be increased from 41 % to 95 % . 
Though the absolute bulk tensile strength decreases slightly , this method presents an easy and effective way to address the mechanical problems inherent in the FFF-method . 
The systematic occurrence of porosities inside selective laser melted ( SLM ) parts is a well-known phenomenon . 
In order to improve the density of SLM parts , it is important not only to assess the physical origin of the different types of porosities , but also to be able to measure as precisely as possible the porosity rate so that one may select the optimum manufacturing parameters.Considering 316 L steel parts built with different input energies , the current paper aims to ( 1 ) present the different types of porosities generated by SLM and their origins , ( 2 ) compare different methods for measuring parts density and ( 3 ) propose optimal procedures . 
After a preliminary optimization step , three methods were used for quantifying porosity rate : the Archimedes method , the helium pycnometry and micrographic observations.The Archimedes method shows that results depend on the nature and temperature of the fluid , but also on the sample volume and its surface roughness.During the micrographic observations , it has been shown that the results depend on the magnification used and the number of micrographs considered.A comparison of the three methods showed that the optimized Archimedes method and the helium pycnometry technique gave similar results , whereas optimized micrographic observations systematically underestimated the porosity rate.In a second step , samples were analyzed to illustrate the physical phenomena involved in the generation of porosities . 
It was confirmed that : ( 1 ) low Volume Energy Density ( VED ) causes non-spherical porosities due to insufficient fusion , ( 2 ) in intermediary VED the small amount of remaining blowhole porosities come from gas occlusion in the melt-pool and ( 3 ) in excessive VED , cavities are formed due to the key-hole welding mode . 
The eutectic Al-33Cu ( wt. 
% ) alloy was processed by selective laser melting . 
Based on the interlamellar distances a local cooling rate can be calculated . 
At high laser powers the cooling rate is 104 K/s , at low laser powers it is 105 K/s . 
The thermal history of selectively laser-melted alloys can be explored . 
The cooling rates inherent to selective laser melting ( SLM ) were experimentally determined by processing the eutectic Al-33Cu ( wt. 
% ) alloy . 
Two different parameter sets yielding an identical volumetric energy density were employed to produce the samples . 
Based on the average spacing of the Al and CuAl2 lamellae , the cooling rates in different parts of the SLM specimens were estimated . 
At a high laser power ( 300 W ) the cooling rate amounts to 104 K/s and at the lower laser power ( 200 W ) to 105 K/s . 
The present approach proves to be useful for exploring the thermal history of additively manufactured metallic components . 
A 3D finite element simulation model of the laser cladding process has been developed taking into account heat transfer , fluid flow , surface tension and free surface movement . 
All input parameters and data , which are independent of the process parameters but depend only on the material and machine properties , have been obtained from measurements . 
Thereby the melt pool and the resulting surface contour can be simulated without compromising assumptions or calibration , because the machine parameters are the only variable input parameters of the model . 
Thus , the model can easily be transferred to other material combinations or other machines . 
For the surface contour calculation a modified height function method is applied . 
The model surface follows this contour as an arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian ( ALE ) method is used allowing for mesh deformations . 
The model was implemented using the commercial finite element software COMSOL Multiphysics and validated by comparing the simulation results with caloric measurements of the effective heat input and metallographic cross sections from experiments , where the nickel-base alloy MetcoClad® 625 in powder form was deposited on structural steel S235JRC + C and the process parameters of laser power , feed speed , laser beam spot size and powder mass flow were varied within a range of at least 50 % of their mean value each . 
The maximum deviation of the simulation results compared to the experimental data regarding track geometry is 14 % for the parameter sets without weld defects so that these parameter sets could be industrially applied , whereas the average deviation of track width and height is below 5.1 % . 
A thermal analysis model of synchronous induction assisted laser deposition is established . 
The effect of the laser-induction interaction mode on the thermal behavior Microstructural evolution mechanisms of synchronous induction assisted laser deposition are revealed . 
The grains and phase can potentially be controlled separately by synchronous induction assisted laser deposition process . 
Synchronous induction-assisted laser deposition ( SILD ) can be used to address issues that arise from the extreme thermal behavior that occurs during direct energy deposition ( DED ) . 
However , the incorporation of induction heating simultaneously renders the thermal behavior during SILD more flexible and complicated . 
This study established a 3-D transient finite element model to elucidate the thermal behavior during SILD with a simplified inductive heat source . 
It should also be noted that although it was more difficult to balance the thermal behavior , the cooling rate at the β transus temperature of Ti-6Al-4 V decreased from 82 ℃/s to 23 ℃/s ; further , the maximum temperature gradient in front of the solid-liquid interface decreased from 5.8 × 105 ℃/m to 4.4 × 105 ℃/m in the “ alternate ” mode , which was relative to the “ without induction heating ” and “ synchronous ” modes . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) is increasingly used for the production of functional parts . 
In order to ensure product reliability in challenging load cases and environments , a valid knowledge of the residual stress state is crucial . 
Since typical , complex AM geometries necessitate simulative efforts for this prediction , suitable validation data are essential . 
This study presents results from neutron diffraction measurements on different stages of a build-up of a simple cuboid structure by laser beam melting . 
The strain-free reference is obtained from measurements on small matchstick geometries cut from an analogously manufactured cuboid at the respective measurement spots . 
By providing quasi-transient data of the evolution of residual stresses in both the base plate and the part , simulation models can be investigated towards their structural validity . 
Results indicate that the assumption of negligible shear strains may not be justifiable . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes are being more frequently applied in several fields ranging from the industrial to the biomedical , in large part owing to their advantages which make them suitable for several applications such as scaffolds for tissue engineering , dental procedures , and 3D models to improve surgical planning . 
Moreover , these processes are particularly suited for the fabrication of microfluidic devices and labs-on-a-chip ( LOC ) designed to work with biological samples and chemical reaction mixtures.An aspect not sufficiently investigated is related to the dimensional verification of these devices . 
The main criticality is the texture-less surface that characterizes the AM products and strongly affects the effectiveness of most currently available 3D optical measuring instruments.In this study , a passive photogrammetric scanning system has been used as a non-destructive and low-cost technique for the reconstruction and measurement of 3D printed microfluidic devices . 
Four devices , manufactured with stereolithography ( SLA ) , fused deposition modelling ( FDM ) a Stratasys trademark , also known as fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) , and Polyjet have been reconstructed and measured , and the results have been compared to those obtained with optical profilometry that is considered as the gold standard . 
Selective laser melting is a promising additive manufacturing technology for the production of complex metal components . 
The technique uses metallic powder as a starting material and a laser for melting and building-up parts layer by layer . 
One crucial factor influencing the process stability and therefore the part quality is the shielding gas flow . 
In addition to the shielding properties of the inert atmosphere the gas flow is responsible for the removal of process by-products like spatter and welding fumes originating from the process zone . 
Insufficient removal or inhomogeneous gas flow distribution may lead to increased interaction between laser and process by-products . 
Consequences are attenuation of the laser spot as well as redeposition of this by-products on surfaces which are exposed to the laser afterwards . 
Furthermore process deviations are provoked by unfavorable gas flow conditions . 
Thirdly , the impact of this deviations on building surface and part quality is investigated by 3D confocal microscopy , microsections and ultrasonic testing . 
Finally , theoretical approach for the formation of these process deviations and arising material defects is presented . 
The high-energy input and thermal history during additive manufacturing lead to complex phase transformations in titanium aluminide alloy . 
This study mostly focuses on determining the solid-state phase transformation mechanisms during laser deposition and the failure mechanisms of alloys using molecular dynamics simulations . 
Because of the directional temperature gradient , columnar grains with fully lamellar microstructures are formed first after solidification . 
A narrow region just below the melting pool is reheated to high temperatures , thus enhancing the precipitation of new equiaxed grains . 
Multiple thermal cycles in the α + γ phase region promote the formation of massive γ phases ( γm ) at the grain boundaries . 
Finally , a nearly lamellar microstructure of alternating columnar and equiaxed grains with γm phases is formed . 
The deposited titanium aluminide alloy has good room and high-temperature ( 760 °C ) tensile properties of 545 ± 9 and 471 ± 37 MPa , with elongations of 1.50 % ± 0.47 % and 1.50 % ± 0.45 % , respectively . 
The room and high-temperature samples both fail in the columnar grain region . 
Although the equiaxed grain regions contain several γm–α2 interfaces , the samples still fail in the columnar grain regions due to the increase in the cracking distance in the equiaxed regions caused by randomly oriented α2 + γ lamellae and the comparably good plasticity of the γm phases . 
Multiple thermal cycles in the α + γ phase region promote the formation of a massive γ phase ( γm ) at the grain boundaries . 
Finally , a nearly lamellar microstructure of alternating arrangement of columnar and equiaxed grains with γm phases is formed . 
Based on the relations among the orientations of the γm , γ , and α2 phases , five interface structure models can be established for the molecular dynamics simulations of TiAl alloy fabricated by directed energy deposition , which can be used to accurately predict the location of the crack nucleation sites during the tensile test . 
Furthermore , we revealed , for the first time , that the interface between α2 and γm is the weakest , especially in the case of semicoherent interfaces ( 6° angle in the [ 1–10 ] direction ) , which provides good nucleation sites for cracks.Download : Download high-res image ( 322 Electron Beam Melting ( EBM ) is an increasingly used Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) technique employed by many industrial sectors , including the medical device and aerospace industries . 
In-situ EBM monitoring for quality assurance purposes has been a popular research area . 
Electronic imaging has recently been investigated as one of the in-situ EBM data collection methods , alongside thermal / optical imaging techniques . 
So far , the disseminations focus on the design of an electronic imaging system and the ability to generate electronic images in-situ , experiments are yet to be carried out to benchmark one of the most important features of any imaging systems – spatial resolution . 
Analyses of experimental results indicated that the spatial resolution was of the order of 0.3 to 0.4 mm when electronic imaging was carried out at room temperature . 
It is believed that by disseminating an analysis and experimental method to estimate and quantify spatial resolution , this study has contributed to the on-going quality assessment research in the field of in-situ monitoring of the EBM process . 
The thermal history developed in laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) processes has been shown to be complex resulting in equally complex microstructures and mechanical properties . 
Three-dimensional finite element analysis was used to simulate thermal history and to predict the residual stress distribution in the as-built material . 
Computational thermodynamics was used to predict the micro-segregation and nucleation driving force of various phases in the bulk and in segregated regions . 
Varied heat-treatments such as simulated hot isostatic pressing , and double aging were applied . 
Their influence on the microstructure , micro-segregation , precipitate formation , and micro-hardness variations of LPBF alloy 718 were investigated . 
Hardness map results showed heterogeneous micro-hardness on the xy- and xz-planes of the as-built parts where the bottom plane and center regions had larger hardness of ∼315 HV0.5 while the top plane and contours showed hardness of ∼300 HV0.5 . 
After simulated hot isostatic pressing process ( i.e. 
, without applied pressure ) at 1020 °C for 4 h followed by water quench ( HIPWQ ) , the hardness gradient and hardness was minimized ( ∼210 HV0.5 ) as the microstructure transitioned from heterogeneous columnar grains in the as-built condition to more uniform recrystallized grains . 
HIPWQ followed by double aging produced a homogeneous microstructure and more uniform hardness map with enhanced mechanical properties in LPBF alloy 718 coupons . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) is a promising manufacturing technique for the production of complex metallic components . 
One of the crucial factors influencing the mechanical properties of the final product is spatter particles formation during the process . 
In this study , high- speed photography is utilized to record the formation mechanisms and the dynamic behavior of spatter particles . 
An image processing analysis framework is utilized to assess the distribution of spatter particles under various energy inputs . 
It is found that changing the laser scan velocity has more influences on spatter formation in comparison with the energy input . 
The relationship between the numbers of created spatter particles , induced unmelted regions and density variability are interpreted and discussed based on other observations , such as microscopic examination and density analysis of SLM parts . 
The obtained results could be used to enhance the current manufacturing process parameters optimization methods in SLM process .

Technical ceramics for high-performance applications can be additively manufactured using vat photopolymerization technology . 
This technology faces two main challenges : increasing ceramic product size and improving product quality . 
The integration of process control strategies into AM equipment is expected to play a key role in tackling these challenges . 
This work demonstrates the feasibility of real-time and in-situ feedback control of the light-initiated polymerization reaction that lies at the core of vat photopolymerization technology . 
Experimental data obtained from this setup was used to develop a control-oriented process model and identify its parameters . 
The results show that the feedback controller successfully compensated for the material perturbation and reached the same final conversion value as the unperturbed case .

Optimization of single track and single layer is required for high final quality . 
Feedbacks between single track , single layer , and the 3D levels were established . 
A multistep algorithm to find optimal SLM process parameters is described . 
The algorithm is illustrated for AISI 420 stainless steel as an example . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) is becoming a powerful additive manufacturing technology for different industries : automotive , medical , chemical , aerospace , etc . 
SLM could dramatically narrow the time frames to optimize production , providing extraordinary freedom to validate design and to develop new materials . 
The extension of applications requires different materials with specific properties and therefore tailored properties of the final product . 
In this article , a hierarchical approach including mutual analysis of SLM parameters necessary to control the final product quality on every level – the track , the layer and the final 3D object – is suggested and discussed . 
Numerical simulation allowed the estimation of temperature distribution during laser melting and predicted final microstructures and properties of a 3D SLM object . 
A series of single tracks , layers and 3D objects were manufactured from AISI 420 stainless steel to validate a proposed algorithm . 
The efficiency of the approach was illustrated by the manufacturing of fully dense samples from AISI 420 stainless steel widely used in the plastics-moulding industry . 
The results show that based on the proposed systematic hierarchical approach , optimal process parameters can be efficiently established for high-quality SLM parts from metal powders . 
High speed imaging with external illumination is used to analyse defects .

Benchmark data of porosity , productivity , roughness , and microhardness is provided . 
In this work , coaxial laser metal wire deposition ( LMWD ) process is studied , with particular attention to defect formation mechanisms and the establishment of stable processing conditions . 
The coaxial LMWD of AISI 308 stainless steel wire was carried out by a multi-mode fiber laser delivered to an industrial coaxial LMWD deposition head . 
The continuous mechanical connection with the deposition region requires further attention to the process dynamics , which may alter the deposition precision and continuity . 
Accordingly , this work presents a systematic analysis of how the defects are formed at single and multiple layer deposition conditions . 
High-speed imaging is employed to reveal the process dynamics as a diagnostics aid . 
The process stability is determined initially at single layer condition , providing a correct match between the melting position and rate of the wire . 
At multiple layer deposition , the thermal load is managed to achieve high-aspect ratio components . 
At the stable conditions , the process is benchmarked for porosity , surface roughness , and deposition rates . 
The use of additive manufacturing ( AM ) provides an opportunity to fabricate composite tooling molds in a rapidly and cost effectively manner . 
This work has shown the use of a polymer based infiltrated ceramics produced via binder jetting for producing composite tooling molds . 
Here , molds based on silica sand as well as zircon sand have been printed on a S-Max 3D printer unit and subsequently impregnated with an epoxy system for yielding functional molds in the range of autoclave temperatures around 150–177 °C . 
The mechanical properties of the infiltrated 3D printed materials have been investigated and it was observed that the polymer-infiltrated systems resulted in a compressive and flexural strength one order of magnitude higher than the non-infiltrated printed ceramic material . 
A thermal analysis was also performed on both the infiltrated and non-infiltrated printed samples , and it was recorded that the incorporation of the polymer resulted in a larger coefficient of thermal expansion on the infiltrated systems . 
Here , a carbon fiber reinforced composite was manufactured with the infiltrated composite tooling molds printed in the S-Max unit , and it was observed that the assembled molds are capable of producing a successful composite material . 
The present work has demonstrated that a binder jetting process , is a feasible technology for producing thermostable low cost composite tooling molds . 
In the present study , laser metal deposition ( LMD ) was used to produce compositionally graded refractory high-entropy alloys ( HEAs ) for screening purposes by in-situ alloying of elemental powder blends . 
A compositional gradient from Ti25Zr50Nb0Ta25 to Ti25Zr0Nb50Ta25 is obtained by incrementally substituting Zr powder with Nb powder . 
A suitable strategy was developed to process the powder blend despite several challenges such as the high melting points of the refractory elements and the large differences in melting points among them . 
The influence of the LMD process on the final chemical composition was analyzed in detail and the LMD process was optimized to obtain a well-defined compositional gradient . 
Microstructures , textures , chemical compositions and mechanical properties were characterized using SEM , EBSD , EDX , and microhardness testing , respectively . 
Compositions between Ti25Zr0Nb50Ta25 and Ti25Zr25Nb25Ta25 were found to be single-phase bcc solid solutions with a coarse grain microstructure . 
Increasing the Zr to Nb ratio beyond the equiatomic composition results in finer and harder multiphase microstructures . 
The results shown in the present study clearly show for the first time that LMD is a suitable processing tool to screen HEAs over a range of chemical compositions . 
Open source 3-D printer to both fabricate slot die and functionalize . 
Created a 3-D slot die printing system . 
Functional lab-grade slot dies may be 3-D printed . 
Semiconductor films deposited with polymer slot die down to 17 nm . 
Slot die coating is growing in popularity because it is a low operational cost and easily scaled processing technique for depositing thin and uniform films rapidly , while minimizing material waste . 
The complex inner geometry of conventional slot dies require expensive machining that limits accessibility and experimentation . 
In order to overcome these issues this study follows an open hardware approach , which uses an open source 3-D printer to both fabricate the slot die and then to functionalize a 3-D slot die printing system . 
Polymer materials are tested and selected for compatibility with common solvents and used to fabricate a custom slot die head . 
This slot die is then integrated into a 3-D printer augmented with a syringe pump to form an additive manufacturing platform for thin film semiconductor devices . 
The full design of the slot die system is disclosed here using an open source license including software and operational protocols . 
This study demonstrates that functional lab-grade slot dies may be 3-D printed using low-cost open source hardware methods A case study using NiO2 found an RMS value 0.486 nm , thickness of 17–49 nm , and a maximum optical transmission of 99.1 % , which shows this additive manufacturing approach to slot die depositions as well of fabrication is capable of producing viable layers of advanced electronic materials . 
Ball-milled Ti/TiC composite particles ( TiC nanoparticles assembled on Ti microparticles ) were designed , prepared , and mixed with Al-Si-Mg powder to fabricate an Al-Si-Mg-Ti alloy with TiC nanoparticles ( Al-Si-Mg-Ti/TiC ) by selective laser melting ( SLM ) . 
Microstructure features , solidification behavior , and mechanical properties were investigated , and the relationship among them was established . 
The SLM-manufactured Al-Si-Mg-Ti/TiC material exhibited fine equiaxed-shaped α ( Al ) grains with nanoscale Si4Ti5 phases and Mg segregation along the grain boundaries . 
This structure benefited from heterogeneous nucleation as well as the grain growth restriction capabilities of TiC nanoparticles on α ( Al ) , fast diffusion of Ti in the superheated Al liquid , and high chemical activity of Ti to Si during solidification . 
Furthermore , Ti enrichment in some local areas of the high-temperature pool and the consequently intense Marangoni convection improved the wettability between TiC nanoparticles and liquid Al without the interfacial reaction . 
Consequently , the SLM-manufactured Al-Si-Mg-Ti/TiC showed a high ultimate tensile strength of up to 562 ± 7 MPa and an elongation of up to 8.8 % ± 1.3 % before fracture . 
These increased mechanical properties are attributed to the combined effect of grain refinement and Orowan and load-bearing strengthening mechanisms . 
In this work , the Direct Ink Writing ( DIW ) technique was used to produce three-dimensional Ti2AlC ceramic components with high , uniform porosity . 
Suitable formulations were developed , with appropriate rheological properties for extruding thin filaments through a nozzle with a diameter of 810 μm . 
The main rheological properties of the inks were investigated to evaluate their behavior and flowability during the printing process . 
Porous Ti2AlC lattices were fabricated , in selected conditions , with uniform pore size and good interconnectivity , and sintered at 1400 °C in Ar . 
Total porosity ranged from ∼44 to ∼63 vol % , and the mechanical strength ranged from ∼43 to 83 MPa . 
The influence of the ink composition and heat-treatment conditions on the phase composition of the 3D porous structures was also evaluated . 
The high thermal gradients experienced during manufacture via selective laser melting commonly result in cracking of high γ/γ′ Nickel based superalloys . 
Such defects can not be tolerated in applications where component integrity is of paramount importance . 
To overcome this , many industrial practitioners make use of hot isostatic pressing to ‘ heal ’ these defects . 
The possibility of such defects re-opening during the component life necessitates optimisation of SLM processing parameters in order to produce the highest bulk density and integrity in the as-built state.In this paper , novel fractal scanning strategies based upon mathematical fill curves , namely the Hilbert and Peano-Gosper curve , are explored in which the use of short vector length scans , in the order of 100 μm , is used as a method of reducing residual stresses . 
The effect on cracking observed in CM247LC superalloy samples was analysed using image processing , comparing the novel fractal scan strategies to more conventional ‘ island ’ scans . 
Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was utilised to determine the cracking mechanisms.Results show that cracking occurs via two mechanisms , solidification and liquation , with a strong dependence on the laser scan vectors . 
Through the use of fractal scan strategies , bulk density can be increased by 2 ± 0.7 % when compared to the ‘ island ’ scanning , demonstrating the potential of fractal scan strategies in the manufacture of typically ‘ unweldable ’ nickel superalloys . 
Porous scaffolds were studied for weight bearing biomedical applications . 
Compression samples were additively manufactured using electron beam melting . 
Reentrant and cubic Ti6Al4 V unit cell geometries were tested under compression . 
Cubic scaffold outperformed the reentrant scaffold at the same relative density . 
A cubic scaffold was proved suitable for load bearing biomedical applications . 
Ti6Al4V porous scaffolds of two unit cell geometries ( reentrant and cubic ) were investigated as candidates for load-bearing biomedical applications . 
Samples were fabricated using an Arcam A2 electron beam melting ( EBM ) machine and evaluated for geometric deviation from the original CAD design using a digital optical microscope . 
The mass and bounding volume of each sample were also measured to calculate the resulting relative density . 
The scaffolds were loaded in compression in the build direction to determine the relative modulus of elasticity and ultimate compressive load . 
Experimental results were used to calculate the Gibson and Ashby relation parameters for the studied unit cell geometries . 
The results suggest that samples with the cubic unit cell geometries , with struts oriented at an angle of 45° to the loading direction , exhibited higher stiffness than samples with the reentrant unit cell geometry at equivalent relative densities . 
A cubic scaffold is verified to withstand high compressive loads ( more than 71 kN ) while having an approximate pore size in the range of 0.6 mm . 
The selective laser melting fabricated 304L stainless steel exhibited an excellent strength–ductility synergy . 
Massive stacking faults and annealing twins formed in the selective laser melting fabricated 304L stainless steel . 
The outstanding ductility is due to the activation of multiple deformation mechanisms . 
The microstructure , mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of the 304L stainless steel ( SS ) additively manufactured by selective laser melting ( SLM ) were systematically investigated . 
The SLM fabricated 304L SS contains two phases ( face-centered-cubic γ-austenite and body-centered-cubic δ-ferrite ) and exhibits a hierarchical microstructure with length scales spanning several orders of magnitude . 
The hierarchical microstructure includes the melt pools and slightly elongated columnar grains at the micron scale , cellular structures decorated with a high density of dislocations at the sub-micron scale and oxides at the nanoscale . 
Stacking faults formed due to the residual stress in addition to the low stacking fault energy of the 304L SS ( 19.2 mJ/m2 ) while massive annealing twins were generated arising from the combined effects of residual stress and intrinsic heat treatment . 
The as built 304L SS exhibits a significantly enhanced strength–ductility synergy compared to that of wrought and annealed counterparts . 
The enhanced yield strength stems from the hierarchically heterogeneous microstructure , while the outstanding tensile elongation is ascribed to the activation of multiple deformation mechanisms , involving the dislocation activities , the formation of stacking faults and mechanical twins , and the transformation-induced plasticity . 
Laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) additive manufacturing ( AM ) is developing with the goal of fabricating parts with high performance and high efficiency . 
Laser power is the key factor to the efficiency , microstructure and performance in LPBF . 
In this work , the molten pool characteristics and spatter behavior in LPBF with a high power and a wide process window ( from 350 W to 1550 W ) are studied based on high-speed high-resolution imaging . 
The results show that the molten pool characteristics and spatter behavior depend on the laser input energy . 
The average ejection velocity and ejection angle increase with the laser power . 
The droplet column ejection and large spatters are prone to occur with a high-power laser . 
Furthermore , the times at which the vapor depression and the protrusion in the molten pool first occur decrease dramatically with an increase in the laser input energy . 
When the laser mode and spot size are kept constant , the laser power determines the amount of time required for melting , the vapor depression and the protrusion in LPBF to occur , while the laser scan velocity determines whether the laser dwell time is sufficient for these phenomena to form . 
Optimum distribution of relative density can enhance the bending stiffness of an architected cellular beam more than 120 % . 
Optimally graded cellular beam samples are 3D printed using stereolithography . 
Experimental bending tests on 3D printed samples confirm the practicality of graded designs for developing advanced lightweight structures . 
Periodic cellular materials can substantially improve the stiffness-to-weight ratio of structures . 
This improvement depends on the geometry of periodic cells . 
This article presents the idea of enhancing the bending stiffness of an architected cellular beam by an optimum distribution of relative density through its length and/or across its thickness . 
Detailed finite element analysis ( FEA ) and experimental bending tests on specimens 3D printed by stereolithography validate the hybrid-homogenized modeling approach . 
The hybrid-homogenized model facilitates transforming the general optimization problem into a shape optimization process with the relative density of unit cells as design variables . 
The teaching-learning-based optimization ( TLBO ) algorithm is used to obtain the optimum relative density distribution , which maximizes the bending stiffness . 
The optimization results show a substantial increase in bending stiffness ; as high as 43 % , 155 % , and 182 % for a cellular beam graded through the length , across the thickness , and in both directions , respectively . 
It is found that varying the relative density of cells across the beam thickness is more effective than variation through the length . 
Detailed FEA and experimental bending tests corroborate the optimization findings and confirm the practicality of such graded designs for developing advanced lightweight structures . 
Investigating the effect of cell architecture also reveals that optimally graded cellular beams have a potential to outperform uniform cellular beams made out of ideal unit cells ( Voigt bound for elastic properties ) by reaching bending stiffness-to-density ratios greater than one . 
The relatively simple graded cellular designs are beneficial in applications where high bending stiffness and low density are essential . 
Recent advances in additive manufacturing promise extending the presented grading strategy for polymeric , composite , and metallic 3D printed cellular materials to fabricate high performance lightweight structural elements at a relatively low cost . 
This study investigated the effect of trace lanthanum hexaboride ( LaB6 ) addition on the microstructure and mechanical properties of an electron beam melting ( EBM ) processed Ti-6Al-4V component . 
LaB6 exhibited a significant effect on the grain structure , phase , and texture of the EBM-processed Ti-6Al-4V alloys . 
Although prior-β columnar grains were observed in both Ti-6Al-4V and LaB6-modified Ti-6Al-4V ( Ti-6Al-4V-LaB6 ) , the width of the columnar grains decreased significantly with LaB6 addition . 
Alternating acicular α′ martensite and acicular α laths were distributed in the Ti-6Al-4V , whereas refined lamellar α + β structures were observed in the Ti-6Al-4V-LaB6 . 
We propose that the addition of LaB6 provided a large amount of heterogenous nucleation sites for solidification and α phase formation . 
Consequently , high tensile strength with considerable elongation was achieved in the EBM-processed Ti-6Al-4V modiﬁed by trace LaB6 addition . 
The purpose of this paper is to identify the key elements of a new hybrid process to produce high quality metal/plastic composites . 
The process is a combination of Fused Deposition Modelling ( FDM ) , vacuum forming and CNC machining . 
The research aims to provide details of the proposed hybrid process , equipment used , and the experimental results of the composites produced . 
The research has been separated into three study areas . 
In the first , the hybrid process has been defined as a whole whereas the second area deals with the breakdown of steps to produce the metal/plastic composites . 
The third area explains the varied materials used for the production and testing of the composites . 
Composites have been made by joining copper ( 99.99 % pure ) mesh with ABS ( acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ) . 
Strain measurement has been carried out on Cu/ABS sample to analyse the effect of metal mesh and to verify the effectiveness of the hybrid process . 
The resulting composites ( Cu/ABS ) have also been subjected to tensile loading with different layers of metal mesh , followed by microstructural analysis and comparative studies to serve as a proof of the methodology . 
The results show that the proposed hybrid process is very effective in producing metal/plastic composites with lower strain values compared to the parent plastic indicating a lower level of deformation due to interlocking of the metal and plastic layers . 
This effect has been reinforced by the tensile testing where the composites showed higher fracture load values compared to the parent plastic . 
Microstructural analysis shows the layer of metal mesh sandwiched between ABS layers indicating the existence of a bond holding the layers of metal and plastic together . 
These results demonstrate the capabilities and effectiveness of the proposed process that has shown promising results under tensile and static loading . 
High-mass-proportion TiCp/Ti6Al4V composites with fully dense prepared by directed energy deposition . 
The changes in microstructure and orientation relationship was discussed in detail . 
Hardness , wear resistance , and thermal conductivity increased , while tensile performance decreased with increasing TiCp content . 
Titanium matrix composites ( TMC ) have potential applications in the aerospace industry because of their excellent performance . 
The comprehensive performance of TMC mainly depends on the matrix , reinforcement and interface characteristics . 
Crack-free high-mass-proportion TiCp/Ti6Al4Vcomposites were successfully prepared by directed energy deposition ( DED ) . 
Meanwhile , the refined α-Ti in the composites had a relatively weak texture . 
In addition , the interface between primary TiC and α-Ti was a semi-coherent interface , exhibiting a 112-0 α-Ti // [ 110 ] TiC , 1-100 α-Ti // 1-11 TiC orientation relationship , which facilitated the heterogeneous nucleation of Ti and improved bonding of primary TiC with the matrix . 
With the increase in microhardness taking the form of a cubic function , the wear mechanism was found to transform from abrasive wear to slight delamination wear . 
Due to the fact that both UMT and primary TiC bonded well with Ti64 matrix , they shared partial friction to protect matrix from severe abrasion , resulting in an excellent wear resistance of composites . 
Moreover , the thermal conductivity of 50 % TiCp/Ti6Al4V was 9.063 W∙m-1∙K-1 , which was nearly 26.5 % higher than that of Ti6Al4V . 
Owing to the premature cracking of brittle UMT and dendritic TiC , the tensile strength and elongation of the composite with 50 % TiCp were 515.5 MPa and 1.83 % , which decreased by 45.8 % and 78.8 % , respectively . 
Adding a high proportion of TiCp can significantly improve the hardness and wear resistance of TMC , whereas it is detrimental to the tensile performance of TMC . 
The study have significant implications for the design of novel TMC , particularly for the aerospace industrial applications . 
This paper presents the design of a high speed , high resolution silicon based thermal imaging instrument and its application to thermally image the temperature distributions of an electron beam melting additive manufacturing system . 
Typically , thermal images are produced at mid or long wavelengths of infrared radiation . 
Using the shorter wavelengths that silicon focal plane arrays are sensitive to allows the use of standard windows in the optical path . 
It also affords fewer modifications to the machine and enables us to make use of mature silicon camera technology . 
With this new instrument , in situ thermal imaging of the entire build area has been made possible at high speed , allowing defect detection and melt pool tracking . 
Melt pool tracking was used to implement an emissivity correction algorithm , which produced more accurate temperatures of the melted areas of the layer . 
Simple , one-step copper electrodeposition on conductive 3D objects Only the most conductive filament enables uniform electroplating . 
Electroplating with additives reduces the surface roughness of the print by 2.4x . 
Electrical resistance improved by 100x after one-step electrodeposition Quality factor of 3D printed inductor is improved by 1740x after electrodeposition . 
3D printing with electrically conductive filaments enables rapid prototyping and fabrication of electronics , but the performance of such devices can be limited by the fact that the most conductive thermoplastic-based filaments for 3D printing are 3750 times less conductive than copper . 
This study explores the use of one-step electrodeposition of copper onto electrically conductive 3D printed objects as a way to improve their conductivity and performance . 
Comparison of three different commercially-available conductive filaments demonstrates that only the most conductive commercially available filament could enable one-step electrodeposition of uniform copper films . 
Electrodeposition improved the electrical conductivity and the ampacity of 3D printed traces by 94 and 17 times respectively , compared to the as-printed object . 
The areal surface roughness of the objects was reduced from 9.3 to 6.9 μm after electrodeposition , and a further reduction in surface roughness to 3.9 μm could be achieved through the addition of organic additives to the electrodeposition bath . 
Copper electrodeposition improved the quality factor of a 3D printed inductor by 1740 times and the gain of a 3D printed horn antenna by 1 dB . 
One-step electrodeposition is a fast and simple way to improve the conductivity and performance of 3D printed electronic components . 
The wide usage of Inconel 718 alloy is based on its fusion weldability and its availability in many different forms including cast , wrought and powder . 
Thus with the emergence of additive manufacturing ( AM ) techniques for metals , Inconel 718 is a prime candidate for materials to be considered . 
Powders that have been developed for powder metallurgy are readily available for use in various AM processes such as selected laser melting ( SLM ) powder bed . 
While much research has focused on optimizing the deposition parameters to achieve fully densified specimens , subsequent heat treatments and their effect on the microstructure also need to be understood . 
This study evaluated the microstructure of SLM specimens of Inconel 718 after various heat treatments and compared the resulting effect on the quasi-static mechanical properties . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) has received a great deal of attention for the ability to produce three dimensional parts via laser heating . 
One recently proposed method of making microscale AM parts is through microscale selective laser sintering ( μ-SLS ) where nanoparticles replace the traditional powders used in standard SLS processes . 
However , there are many challenges to understanding the physics of the process at nanoscale as well as with conducting experiments at that scale ; hence , modeling and computational simulations are vital to understand the sintering process physics . 
At the sub-micron ( μm ) level , the interaction between nanoparticles under high power laser heating raises additional near-field thermal issues such as thermal diffusivity , effective absorptivity , and extinction coefficients compared to larger scales . 
Thus , nanoparticle 's distribution behavior and characteristic properties are very important to understanding the thermal analysis of nanoparticles in a μ-SLS process . 
This paper presents a discrete element modeling ( DEM ) study of how copper nanoparticles of given particle size distribution pack together in a μ-SLS powder bed . 
Initially , nanoparticles are distributed randomly into the bed domain with a random initial velocity vector and set boundary conditions . 
The particles are then allowed to move in discrete time steps until they reach a final steady state position , which creates the particle packing within the powder bed . 
The particles are subject to both gravitational and cohesive forces since cohesive forces become important at the nanoscale . 
A set of simulations was performed for different cases under both Gaussian and log-normal particle size distributions with different standard deviations . 
In addition , this paper suggests a potential method to overcome the agglomeration effects in μ-SLS powder beds through the use of colloidal nanoparticle solutions that minimize the cohesive interactions between individual nanoparticles . 
Grain morphology control is a challenging issue for additive manufactured NiTi alloy , which directly affects the functional properties . 
In this work , La2O3 addition was applied to control microstructure and improve functional properties of directed energy deposited ( DED ) NiTi alloy . 
The results showed that the DEDed NiTi alloy mainly consisted of NiTi ( B2 ) columnar grains and some coarse NiTi2 phases within and at the boundaries of NiTi grains . 
The addition of La2O3 led to the promotion of columnar-to-equiaxed transition and grain refinement of NiTi ( B2 ) phase . 
La2O3 and LaNi secondary phases can be found in the DEDed NiTi alloy with La2O3 addition . 
The La2O3 precipitate could act as the effective heterogeneous nucleation site and the NiTi2 or LaNi precipitates could pin the grain boundaries contributing to the grain refinement and the formation of equiaxed grains of NiTi ( B2 ) phase . 
The introduction of La2O3 could also refine the phase size and adjust morphology of NiTi2 phase , which was attributed to the increase of nucleation sites and more dispersed L ( Ti-rich ) .The temperatures and latent heat of phase transformation evidently increase with La2O3 addition due to the decrease in the Ni content and La dissolved into NiTi ( B2 ) phase . 
Improved superelasticity property was achieved after La2O3 addition owing to the promotion of grain order and yield strength of NiTi ( B2 ) phase and the reduction of resistance from NiTi2 phase for the interface movement . 
Mechanisms underlying the evolution of texture and microstructure during selective laser melting ( SLM ) and their combined effects on the mechanical response of 316L stainless steel are presented . 
Long columnar grains with a fiber texture < 110 > || build direction ( BD ) evolved in the SLM printed material . 
Fiber texture was stronger in the horizontal build compared to the vertical build . 
Use of bidirectional scanning strategy enforced epitaxial growth of grains across melt pools present within a single printed layer . 
< 110 > || BD texture evolved as a consequence of maintaining the balance between epitaxy and growth of [ 100 ] along maximum thermal gradient . 
High dislocation density and not grain size effect of the ultra-fine cellular structure , imparted high strength to 316L . 
Lower average Schmid factor and smaller effective grain size in the horizontal build by virtues of crystallographic and morphological textures , respectively , imparted higher yield strength than the vertical build . 
The horizontal build demonstrated higher strain hardening rate in the early stages of deformation compared to the vertical build due to higher crystallographic texture dependent twinning . 
However , the higher rate of dislocation annihilation led to a continuous decline in the strain hardening rate of the horizontal build . 
In contrast , a stable strain hardening rate was maintained in the vertical build , which led to higher ductility than the horizontal build . 
In summary , the roles of non-equilibrium microstructure and texture ( crystallographic and morphological ) in regulating mechanical properties elucidated here , can be utilized in designing additively manufactured structural components of 316L stainless steel . 
Spatter particles ejected from the melt pool after melting of 316 L stainless steel by laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing ( LPBF ) , were found to contain morphologies not observed in as-atomized 316 L powder . 
This spatter consisted of large , spherical particles , highly dendritic surfaces , particles with caps of accreted liquid , and agglomerations of multiple individual particles fixed together by liquid ligaments . 
The focus of this study is on an additional , unique spatter morphology consisting of larger , spherical particles with surface oxide spots exhibiting a wide distribution of surface configurations , including organized patterning . 
Spatter particles with organized surface oxide patterns were characterized for surface and internal particle features using multiple imaging techniques . 
The following observations are made : 1 ) spots resided at the spatter particle surface and did not significantly penetrate the interior , 2 ) the spot ( s ) were amorphous and rich in Silicon ( Si ) -Manganese ( Mn ) -Oxygen ( O ) , 3 ) a two-part Chromium ( Cr ) -O rich layer exists between the particle and spot , 4 ) Cr-O rich morphological features were present at the top surface of the spots , 5 ) the spatter particle composition was consistent with 316 L but appeared to decrease in Si content into the spatter particle away from a spot , and 6 ) small Si-rich spherical particles existed within the spatter particle interior . 
In this study , the fatigue properties of binder-jet 3D-printed nickel-base superalloy 625 were evaluated . 
Standard fatigue specimens were printed and sintered , then half of the samples were mechanically ground , while the other half were left in their as-sintered state . 
They were then characterized using micro-computed x-ray tomography , metallographic sample examination , and optical and stylus profilometry for surface topography . 
The micro-computed tomography observations showed that density of the as-printed sample was ∼50 % , while the sintered sample neared full densification ( 98.9 ± 0.3 % ) upon sintering at 1285 °C for 4 h in a vacuum atmosphere . 
The metallographic examination showed equiaxed grains . 
The roughness of the as-sintered samples was significant with an RMS roughness of Rq = 1.39 ± 0.20 μm as measured over a line-scan of 5 mm , but this was reduced to Rq = 0.47 ± 0.02 μm after mechanical grinding . 
All samples were tested to failure in fatigue , under fully-reversed tension-compression conditions . 
While the as-sintered samples showed poor fatigue properties compared to prior reports on cast and milled parts , the ground samples showed superior performance . 
Scanning electron microscopy observation was conducted on the fractured surfaces and showed that the samples underwent transgranular crack initiation , followed by intergranular crack growth and final failure . 
In the mechanically ground sample , hardness increased nearly two-fold up to 75 μm beneath the sample ’ s surface , and X-ray diffraction indicated an in-plane compressive stress , grain refinement , and micro-strain on the mechanically ground sample . 
The reduced roughness , surface hardening , and compressive stress resulted in increased fatigue life of the binder-jetted alloy 625 . 
Every SLM-fabricated component typically possesses a process-specific microstructure that fundamentally differs from any conventionally fabricated specimen . 
This publication addresses the evaluation of microstructure-related influencing factors on the resistance against cavitation erosion . 
We exemplarily compared the findings to a cast and hot rolled reference sample . 
Due to careful adjustment of the process parameters , the overall cavitation erosion resistance of both SLM-processed and conventionally fabricated 316L are very much alike in the investigated case . 
The incubation period of intact surface areas is improved by the greater hardness and yield strength of the SLM specimen , which is attributable to an increased dislocation density and a smaller grain size . 
Nevertheless , processing and powder feeding during SLM-fabrication occasionally results in microstructural defects , at which pronounced mass loss during cavitation was registered . 
X-ray measurements of the residual stresses reveal the development of severe compressive stresses that emerge after a few seconds of cavitation . 
This compressive stress state delays the immediate propagation of SLM-inherent micro cracks . 
Moreover , investigations of the microstructure in combination with examination of the ongoing surface deformation highlighted the emergence of coarse grains that grew towards the temperature gradient . 
This effect leads to a temporarily high surface roughness , local stress concentrations and an increased probability of cavitation impacts . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) wherein a metal part is built in a layer-by-layer manner in a powder bed is a promising and versatile way for manufacturing components with complex geometry . 
However , components built by SLM suffer from substantial deformation of the part and residual stresses . 
Residual stresses arise due to temperature gradients inherent to the process and the accompanying deformation . 
It is well known that the SLM process parameters and the laser scanning strategy have a substantial effect on the temperature transients of the part and henceforth on the degree of deformations and residual stresses . 
In order to provide a tool to investigate this relation , a semi-analytical thermal model of the SLM process is presented which determines the temperature evolution in a 3D part by way of representing the moving laser spot with a finite number of point heat sources . 
The solution of the thermal problem is constructed from the superposition of analytical solutions for point sources which are known in semi-infinite space and complimentary numerical/analytical fields to impose the boundary conditions . 
The unique property of the formulation is that numerical discretisation of the problem domain is decoupled from the steep gradients in the temperature field associated with localised laser heat input . 
This enables accurate and numerically tractable simulation of the process . 
The predictions of this semi-analytical model are validated by experiments and the exact solution known for a simple thermal problem . 
Simulations for building a complete layer using two different scanning patterns and subsequently building of multiple layers with constant and rotating scanning patterns in successive layers are performed . 
The computational efficiency of the semi-analytical tool is assessed which demonstrates its potential to gain physical insight in the full SLM process with acceptable computational costs . 
This work investigated the processing of high nitrogen-alloyed austenitic stainless steels by laser powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) . 
Prior to L-PBF processing , the AISI 316 L steel powder was nitrided at a temperature of 675°C in a 3 bar nitrogen atmosphere , thus achieving a N content of 0.58 mass- % . 
By mixing nitrided 316 L powder with untreated 316 L powder , two different powder mixtures were obtained with 0.065 mass- % and 0.27 mass- % nitrogen , respectively . 
After nitriding and mixing , the powder was characterized in terms of its flow properties and chemical composition . 
The nitrided steel powder was then processed by L-PBF , and the microstructure as well as the chemical composition were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy and carrier gas hot extraction . 
It was shown that nitriding of steel powders in an N2 atmosphere can be used to significantly increase the nitrogen content of the powder without impairing its flow properties . 
With increasing nitrogen content of the powder , the porosity within the L-PBF built specimens increased . 
However , both the yield strength and the tensile strength were greatly improved without a marked reduction in the elongation at fracture of the respective steels . 
This work shows that nitrogen-alloyed austenitic stainless steels can be processed by L-PBF and the mechanical properties can be improved . 
Laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) has broad application prospects due to its high fabrication accuracy and excellent performance , but the dynamic mechanical properties of LPBF components are relatively low due to defects of the melt track such as protrusions and depressions , whose generation mechanisms remain unclear . 
In this work , we investigate the correlation between the ex situ melt track properties and the in situ high-speed , high-resolution characterization . 
We correlate the protrusion at the starting position of the melt track with the droplet ejection behaviour and backward surging melt . 
We also reveal that the inclination angles of the depression walls are consistent with the ejection angles of the backward-ejected spatter . 
Furthermore , we quantify the vapour recoil pressure by in situ characterization of the deflection of the typical forward-ejected spatter . 
Our results clarify the intrinsic correlation of the melt track properties , which is important for the stable LPBF formation with few defects . 
Fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) 3D printers have been largely limited to thermoplastics in the past but with new composite materials available on the market there are new possibilities for what these machines can produce . 
Using a conductive composite filament , electronic components can be manufactured but due to the filament ’ s relatively poor electrical properties , the resulting traces are typically highly resistive . 
Selective electroplating on these parts is one approach to incorporate materials with high conductivity onto 3D-printed structures . 
In this paper , non-conductive and conductive filaments printed in the same part are used to enable selective electroplating directly on regions defined by the conductive filament to create metallic parts through 3D printing . 
This technique is demonstrated for the creation of multiple distinct conductive segments and to electroplate the same part with multiple metals to , for instance , allow a magnetic metal such as nickel and a highly conductive one such as copper to be incorporated in the same part . 
Following the characterization of the process , a representative 3D printed electrical device , a selectively electroplated solenoid inductor with low frequency inductance and resistance of 191 nH and 18.7 mΩ respectively was manufactured using this technique . 
This is a five order of magnitude reduction in resistance over the original value of 3 kΩ for the inductor before electroplating . 
Previous research on periodic lattice structures shows these structures are highly mechanically efficient with exceptionally high stiffness- and strength-to-weight ratios . 
Additive manufacturing technologies allow the construction slender member structures with complicated macroscale shapes . 
Structures with large numbers of geometric objects cause the conventional methods for manipulating , storing , and slicing the geometry of these parts via STL files to be highly inefficient . 
This work describes an alternate design process for slender member structures using efficient methods for manipulating , storing , and slicing the geometry of the part . 
These new methods , in particular a fast , efficient direct slicing method , enable printing slender member structures with over one hundred thousand struts . 
In this study , martensitic cold-work tool steel X65MoCrWV3-2 was processed by selective laser melting ( SLM ) by varying the laser scanning parameters and baseplate preheating temperatures . 
Porosity as well as crack density of the SLM-densified steel were determined by quantitative image analysis . 
The resulting microstructure and the associated local mechanical properties were characterized , and the hardness-tempering behavior of the SLM-densified steel was compared to the behavior of the conventionally manufactured X65MoCrWV3-2 steel in the cast and hot-formed condition . 
Regardless of the preheating temperature , SLM-densified X65MoCrWV3-2 possesses a porosity of less than 0.5 vol.- % . 
The crack density was reduced significantly by means of a higher preheating temperature . 
The microstructure after SLM densification shows a fine , equiaxed cellular-dendritic subgrain structure , superimposed by lath- or needle-like martensite . 
The martensite morphology appeared to be finer at a lower preheating temperature , whereas the observed subgrain structure did not seem to be influenced by the preheating temperatures . 
Microhardness measurements indicated tempering effects in first solidified layers caused by the densification of subsequently deposited layers . 
Peak hardness after tempering of the SLM-densified steel was found to be higher compared to the maximum hardness in the X65MoCrWV3-2 steel in the cast condition . 
In order to ensure a reliable and repeatable additive manufacturing process , the material delivery rate in the directed energy deposition ( DED ) process requires in situ monitoring and control . 
This paper demonstrates acoustic emission ( AE ) sensing as a method of monitoring the flow of powder feedstock in a powder fed DED process . 
With minimal calibration , this signal closely correlates to the actual mass flow rate . 
This article describes the fabricated mass flow monitoring system , documents various conditions in which the actual flow rate deviates from its set value , and details situations that highlight the system ’ s utility . 
The work presented here highlights the results obtained and illustrates that accurate monitoring of powder flow in real-time regardless of environmental conditions within the build chamber is possible . 
Selective electron beam melting ( SEBM ) is a type of additive manufacturing ( AM ) that involves multiple physical processes . 
Because of its unique process conditions compared to other AM processes , a detailed investigation into the molten pool behavior and dominant physics of SEBM is required . 
Fluid convection involves mass and heat transfer ; therefore , fluid flow can have a profound effect on solidification conditions . 
In this study , computational thermal-fluid dynamics simulations with multi-physical modeling and proof-of-concept experiments were used to analyze the molten pool behavior and resultant thermal conditions related to solidification . 
The Marangoni effect of molten metal primarily determines fluid behavior and is a critical factor affecting the molten pool instability in SEBM of the Co–Cr–Mo alloy . 
The solidification parameters calculated from simulated data , especially the solidification rate , are sensitive to the local fluid flow at the solidification front . 
Combined with experimental analysis , the results presented herein indicate that active fluid convection at the solidification front increase the probability of new grain formation , which suppresses the epitaxial growth of columnar grains . 
The capability of Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) to manufacture multi-materials allows the fabrication of complex and multifunctional objects with heterogeneous material compositions and varying mechanical properties . 
The material jetting AM process specifically has the capability to manufacture multi-material structures with both rigid and flexible material properties . 
Existing research has investigated the fatigue properties of 3D printed multi-material specimens and shows that there is a weakness at multi-material interfaces . 
This paper seeks to , instead , investigate the effects of gradual material transitions on the fatigue life of 3D printed multi-material specimens . 
In order to examine the fatigue life at the multi-material interface , stepwise gradients are compared against continuous gradients created through voxel-based design . 
Results demonstrate the effects of different material gradient patterns and different material transition lengths on the fatigue life of multi-material specimens . 
In addition , the behavior of individual material composites is studied to confirm how gradient designs based on different material compositions affect their material properties . 
The wire-based direct energy deposition of metallic lightweight materials such as titanium or aluminium alloys has recently received increasing attention in industry and academia . 
However , high-throughput deposition is mostly associated with process-limiting phenomena such as the development of high temperatures resulting in poor surface quality as well as coarse and unidirectional solidification microstructures . 
In this regard , laser systems , which are already widely used in industrial processes , allow for a great variety in the controllability of energy inputs , thereby enabling the control of process temperatures and resulting microstructures . 
The subject of the current study is the detailed elucidation and evaluation of important features such as the development of temperature gradients , resulting cooling rates and thermal cycles for different laser beam irradiances . 
Significant heat accumulation and process instabilities as well as inhomogeneous thermal profiles along the length and height of the parts were observed at a high laser beam irradiance . 
In contrast , lower laser beam irradiance resulted in a more stable process with increased cooling rates , which favourably influenced the refinement of the solidification microstructure . 
Selective Laser Sintering ( SLS ) is a rapidly growing additive manufacturing process , because it has the capacity to build parts from a variety of materials . 
However , the dimensional accuracy of the fabricated parts in this process is dependent on the ability to control phenomena such as warpage and shrinkage . 
This research presents an optimization algorithm to find the best processing parameters for minimizing warpage . 
The finite element method was used to simulate the sintering of a layer of polymer powder , and the warpage of the layer was calculated . 
The numerical model was verified through comparison with experimental results . 
A back-propagation neural network was used to formulate the mapping between the design variables and the objective function . 
Results of 40 simulation cases with various input parameters such as scanning pattern and speed , laser power , surrounding temperature , and layer thickness were used to train and test the neutral network . 
Finally , The Genetic Algorithm was employed to optimize the objective function , and the influence of parameters on warpage was investigated . 
Insight into the performance of fibre-reinforced functionally graded lattices ( FGLs ) from an experimental perspective . 
Effect of grading severity and build direction on the stiffness , energy absorption and structural response of FGLs . 
Categorization of FGLs with regards to ideally bending/stretching-dominated lattices , as proposed by Gibson-Ashby model . 
Semi-empirical analysis of the energy absorption and stiffness estimation for higher fibre volume fraction ( Halpin-Tsai ) . 
the scope for fine-tuning the properties of lattices to harness the potential for multi-functional AM-parts . 
Architectured structures , particularly functionally graded lattices , are receiving much attention in both industry and academia as they facilitate the customization of the structural response and harness the potential for multi-functional applications . 
This work experimentally investigates how the severity of density and unit cell size grading as well as the building direction affects the stiffness , energy absorption and structural response of additively manufactured ( AM ) short fibre-reinforced lattices with same relative density . 
Specimens composed of tessellated body-centred cubic ( BCC ) , Schwarz-P ( SP ) and Gyroid ( GY ) unit cells were tested under compression . 
Compared to the uniform lattices of equal density , it was found , that modest density grading has a positive and no effect on the total compressive stiffness of SP and BCC lattices , respectively . 
Unit cell size grading had no significant influence on the stiffness and revealed an elastomer-like performance as opposed to the density graded lattices of the same relative density , suggesting a foam-like behaviour . 
Density grading of bending-dominated unit cell lattices showcased better energy absorption capability for small displacements , whereas grading of the stretching-dominated counterparts is advantageous for large displacements when compared to the ungraded lattice . 
The severity of unit cell size graded lattices does not affect the energy absorption capability . 
Finally , a power-law approach was used to semi-empirically derive a formula that predicts the cumulative energy absorption as a function of the density gradient and relative density . 
The microstructure and mechanical properties of lattice structures of various relative densities manufactured by Electron Beam Melting were analyzed . 
Special interest was given to the effect of surface roughness on their elastic behavior . 
Compression testing revealed that the important decrease in roughness caused by chemical etching results in an increase in relative stiffness , in comparison with an as-built structure of the same relative density . 
This study investigates the material and mechanical properties of both polyamide 12 ( PA12 ) and reinforced glass bead PA12 composites , fabricated using a production scale additive manufacturing ( AM ) process . 
The printing studies were carried out using the production scale , Multi Jet Fusion powder bed fusion process . 
The study demonstrated that the chemical functionality and the thermal properties of the printed PA 12 parts and the glass bead composite , were similar . 
Based on DSC measurements , the melting temperature was 184 °C and 186 °C and the associated cooling cycle temperature was 150 °C and 146 °C for the composite and the PA12 respectively . 
The percentage crystallinity of the glass bead composite was 24 % , compared with the 31 % obtained for the PA12 only parts . 
Based on mechanical tests , the addition of glass beads increased the tensile and flexural modulus by 85 % and 36 % and lowered the tensile and flexural strength by 39 % and 15 % respectively . 
The effect of print orientation during the MJF process was evaluated based on porosity and mechanical performance . 
Using X-ray micro computed tomography , it was demonstrated that the porosity of the PA12 and composite parts were less than 1 % . 
Polymer and composite parts printed in the ZYX orientation were found to exhibit both the lowest porosity and highest mechanical strengths . 
The spatiotemporal variations of the molten pool and deposit profiles during laser Directed Energy Deposition ( DED ) largely affect the formation of printing defects and the build quality . 
Quantitative assessment of the dependencies of molten pool characteristics on critical process variables is helpful to reveal the evolution of the depositing tracks . 
To this end , a novel 3D transient phenomenological model was developed in this work to explore the evolution of the temperature and velocity fields and the molten pool dimensions for both single-track and multi-track laser DED deposits . 
The computed deposit profiles showed that the contact angles of the single-tracks increased significantly with higher MUL intensity . 
The simulation results showed that convex deposit profiles obtained at high MUL intensity further caused inter-track voids during multi-track deposition . 
To compare the effect of selective laser melting variables on different mechanical properties and compare the results . 
Statistical analysis was used for characterising the interaction and effect of parameters on the hardness and density . 
Describing the governing phenomena on melting pool rheology and its effect on density and hardness . 
In this paper , we printed Ti-6Al-4V SLM parts based on Taguchi design of experiment and related standards to measure and compare hardness with different mechanical properties that were obtained in our previous research such as density , strength , elongation , and average surface . 
Then the effect of process parameters comprising laser power , scan speed , hatch space , laser pattern angle coupling , along with heat treatment as a post-process , in relation to hardness was analysed . 
Another contribution is related to the analysis of process parameters in relation to hardness and explaining them by rheological phenomena . 
The results showed an interesting similarity between hardness and density which is highly related to the formation of the melting pool and porosities within the process . 
The layerwise production paradigm entailed in laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) offers the opportunity to acquire a wide range of information about the process stability and the part quality while the part is being manufactured . 
Different authors pointed out that high-resolution imaging of each printed layer combined with image segmentation methods can be used to detect powder recoating errors together with surface and geometrical defects . 
The paper presents the first study aimed at characterizing the accuracy of in-situ contour identification in LPBF layerwise images by means of a measurement system performance characterization . 
Different active contours segmentation methods are compared , and the sources of variability of the resulting measurements are investigated in terms of repeatability , part-to-part and build-to-build variability . 
The study also analyses and compares the sensitivity of in-situ measurements to different lighting conditions and laser scan directions . 
The results show that , by combining appropriate image pre-processing and segmentation algorithms with suitable lighting configurations , a high measurement repeatability can be achieved , i.e. 
, a pure error that is up to one order of magnitude lower than the total measurement variability . 
This performance enables the detection of major geometric deviations and it paves the way to the design of statistical in-situ quality monitoring tools that rely on layerwise image segmentation . 
Previous studies have shown that 3D printed composites exhibit an orthotropic nature with inherently lower interlayer mechanical properties . 
This research work is an attempt to improve the interlayer tensile strength of extrusion-based 3D printed composites . 
Annealing was identified as a suitable post-processing method and was the focus of this study . 
Two distinct thermoplastic polymers , which are common in 3D printing , were selected to study the enhancement of interlayer tensile strength of composites by additive manufacturing : a ) an amorphous polyethylene terephthalate-glycol ( PETG ) , and b ) a semi-crystalline poly ( lactic acid ) ( PLA ) . 
It was determined that short carbon fiber reinforced composites have lower interlayer tensile strength than the corresponding neat polymers in 3D printed parts . 
This reduction in mechanical performance was attributable to an increase in melt viscosity and the consequential slower interlayer diffusion bonding . 
However , the reduction in interlayer tensile strength could be recovered by post-processing when the annealing temperature was higher than the glass transition temperature of the amorphous polymer . 
In the case of the semi-crystalline polymer , the recovery of the interlayer tensile strength was only observed when the annealing temperature was higher than the glass transition temperature but lower than the cold-crystallization temperature . 
This study utilized rheological and thermal analysis of 3D printed composites to provide a better understanding of the interlayer strength response and , therefore , overcome a mechanical performance limitation of these materials . 
In situ high-speed thermal monitoring of melt-pool during laser powder bed fusion . 
Probabilistic prediction of pore formation based on in situ pyrometry monitoring . 
Detection of conduction-to-keyhole transition using high-speed pyrometry . 
Creation of pores and defects during laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) can lead to poor mechanical properties and thus must be minimized . 
Post-build inspection is required to ensure the printed parts contain acceptably low defect concentrations . 
As a potential solution , in situ process monitoring can be used to detect the creation of defects , characterize local material behavior and predict expected component properties . 
However , the precise relationship between pore creation and in situ process monitoring still needs to be understood . 
In this work , high-speed infrared diode-based pyrometry and high-speed optical imaging signals were used to monitor LPBF printing of 446 stainless steel 316 L single tracks with varying laser power and velocity . 
Results indicate an increase in pyrometer signal and melt pool dimensions with increasing laser power and decreasing velocity in agreement with previous work . 
Critically , pore defect initiation as characterized by ex situ X-ray radiography was correlated with in situ thermal monitoring signals to derive the probability of defect creation . 
Our results show that , in principle , a probabilistic prediction of pore formation can be achieved based on in situ high-speed pyrometry monitoring of the LPBF melt pool . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) is an attractive technology , enabling the manufacture of customised , complex metallic designs , with minimal wastage . 
However , uptake by industry is currently impeded by several technical barriers , such as the control of residual stress , which have a detrimental effect on the manufacturability and integrity of a component . 
Indirectly , these impose severe design restrictions and reduce the reliability of components , driving up costs . 
This paper uses a thermo-mechanical model to better understand the effect of laser scan strategy on the generation of residual stress in SLM . 
A complex interaction between transient thermal history and the build-up of residual stress has been observed in the two laser scan strategies investigated . 
The temperature gradient mechanism was discovered for the creation of residual stress . 
The greatest stress component was found to develop parallel to the scan vectors , creating an anisotropic stress distribution in the part . 
The stress distribution varied between laser scan strategies and the cause has been determined by observing the thermal history during scanning . 
Using this , proposals are suggested for designing laser scan strategies used in SLM . 
Near-net shape metal parts of great geometrical complexity are fabricated by the Laser Powder Bed Fusion ( L-PBF ) technology directly from a CAD model . 
Therefore , parts can be lightweight , less expensive in terms of material use and with shapes that may be impossible to produce by conventional technology . 
The fatigue behavior of L-PBF part in as-built condition is negatively affected by poor surface quality . 
Surface finishing after fabrication may be either unacceptably costly or impossible because the surface is inaccessible . 
Fatigue performance can be further reduced by the notch effect due to local geometrical variations . 
Among the Al-alloys , AlSi10Mg is readily processed with L-PBF and it is of interest for different industrial sectors.In this contribution two aspects , that is : i ) the directional smooth fatigue behavior of as-built AlSi10Mg , and ii ) the notch fatigue behavior with as-built surfaces are investigated . 
Eight sets of un-notched and notched miniature specimens of AlSi10Mg were produced as a single batch by L-PBF and tested in the as-build state under cyclic plane bending loading . 
The smooth fatigue behavior was determined as very sensitive to applied stress direction with respect to the build direction . 
The directional nature of the fatigue behavior was confirmed by notch fatigue data . 
Therefore , four notch fatigue factors that depend on the PBF technology were introduced and determined . 
The fatigue behavior of L-PBF AlSi10Mg obtained here was compared satisfactorily against recent data obtained with standard specimen geometries and test methods . 
The present methodology using mini specimens under cyclic bending efficiently determines the fatigue response of L-PBF metals . 
Interlayer bonds pose regions of weakness in structures produced via melt extrusion based polymer additive manufacturing . 
Bond strength was assessed both between layers and within layers as a function of print parameters by performing tensile tests on ABS coupons printed in two orientations . 
Print parameters considered were extruder temperature , print speed , and layer height . 
An IR camera was used to track thermal history of interlayer bond lines during the printing process . 
Contact length between roads was measured from mesostructure optical micrographs . 
Print speed was found to have a large impact on tensile strength with high speeds generally yielding lower strength . 
A plateau in tensile strength of 22 MPa was observed for a normalized contact length greater than 0.6 independent of print orientation . 
Laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) is a popular additive manufacturing ( AM ) process that has shown promise in fabricating novel components that can be utilized for a wide variety of applications . 
However , one of the main drawbacks of LPBF is that it produces large thermal gradients and fast cooling rates during the solidification of each layer , which can lead to large levels of residual stress/distortion , sometimes resulting in build failure/rejection . 
In the present work , several experimental techniques ( x-ray diffraction , hole drilling , contour method , and laser line profilometry ) were utilized to establish the effect of LPBF process parameters ( scan speed , laser power , build height , build plan area , and substrate condition ) on residual stress evolution and distortion . 
X-ray diffraction and hole-drilling measurements were performed on the surfaces of the LPBF deposits and substrates , while bulk residual stresses were measured using the contour method . 
In addition , a laser line profilometer was used to measure the distortion after fabrication . 
The results obtained by the non-destructive and destructive measurement techniques suggested that process parameters greatly influence the development of residual stress and distortion throughout the LPBF deposit and the substrate . 
Furthermore , the experimental results in this work provide a valuable foundation for future modeling and simulation of the evolution of residual stress and distortion . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) is a method of laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing ( AM ) currently being pursued in numerous industries , including space launch and space flight . 
In this study we performed an extensive parameter development investigation to better understand the effect of laser parameters on surface roughness , density , and porosity of SLM Inconel 718 parts . 
Laser energy density was varied via laser focus shift , and the effects on porosity in both as-printed and post-HIP treated states were analyzed . 
Tensile testing was also conducted to investigate the effect of processing conditions on the mechanical properties of SLM 718 . 
It was found that for these laser parameters , while the material met ultimate tensile strength and yield strength requirements per AMS 5662 , the strain-to-failure was reduced with negative focus shift due to increases in porosity levels . 
It was also found that while correlations were observed between surface roughness , density , and porosity within the laser focus shift range investigated , porosity measurement appears to be the clearest indicator of build quality for AM processed 718 . 
Managing the dimensional accuracy of parts produced by the Electron Beam Melting process is a challenge . 
For small dimensions , as in lattice structures ( strut diameters ) , accuracy becomes even more important and geometric quality is linked to mechanical properties . 
The dimensional quality of parts produced by EBM can be influenced by many process parameters . 
Simulating the process can help the machine user to choose the best process parameters and improve build dimensional accuracy . 
The work presented here is based on a method for linking process parameters with beam parameters . 
Once linked , both sets of parameters are then integrated into a full simulation of the process in order to make trajectory optimization possible . 
First , this paper explains how the finite element model described in the literature can be improved to simulate the multilayer EBM process . 
It then describes how this simulation is used to develop a method to characterize the machine beam and determine the link between the focus current and the beam diameter . 
Finally , it shows how this simulation can be applied to a built shape ( vertical strut ) hence demonstrating improved accuracy of the produced part . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) is a rapidly expanding framework of production technologies evolving in different directions , following the needs of different industries . 
Among powder bed fusion technologies , one of the main branches of AM , selective laser sintering ( SLS ) is the second oldest one . 
In the last few years , a direct rival has emerged : multi jet fusion ( MJF ) . 
The purpose of this work is to compare these processes throughout a systematic analysis of powder and final parts made of commercially available polyamide 12 ( PA12 ) . 
Differences have been spotted both on the molecular and powder scale , with end capping of the MJF feedstock together with different thermal properties of the new and recycled materials . 
On the other hand , flowing properties are similar among the two virgin and recycled powders , with only a significant change in the fraction of fines for SLS material . 
The parts produced through SLS exhibit higher Young 's modulus but lower elongation at break and ultimate tensile strength if compared to the ones obtained using MJF . 
Also Charpy impact strength according to ISO 179 has been tested , confirming the literature data for SLS , but also showing higher strength in the out-of-plane direction for un-notched specimens coming from MJF . 
Finally , the evaluation of advanced area roughness parameters such as surface roughness , skewness and kurtosis according to ISO 25178 allows the ascertainment of subtle differences arising in parts with different positioning on the build platform , possibly due to the inks employed in the MJF process . 
An effective process prediction model was developed for additive manufacturing . 
High entropy alloy was used to test the model . 
The model effectively predicts energy density for processing metallic materials . 
Surface structure of power and powder bed can improve laser absorptivity . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) is a laser-based additive manufacturing technique that can fabricate parts with complex geometries and sufficient mechanical properties . 
However , the optimal SLM process windows of metallic materials are difficult to predict , especially when exploring new metallic materials . 
In this paper , a universal and simplified model has been proposed to predict the energy density suitable for SLM of a variety of metallic materials including Ti and Ti alloys , Al alloy , Ni-based superalloy and steel , on the basis of the relationship between energy absorption and consumption during SLM . 
Several important but easily overlooked factors , including the surface structure of metallic powder , porosity of powder bed , vaporization and heat loss , were considered to improve the accuracy of the model . 
Results show that , to achieve near-full density parts , the energy absorption ( Qa ) by the local powder bed should be approximately 3–8 times greater than the energy consumption ( Qc ) , and this finding applies to all materials investigated . 
The value of Qa/Qc highly depends on material properties , particularly laser absorptivity , latent heat of melting and specific heat capacity . 
Experiments on high-entropy alloy ( CrMnFeCoNi ) and Hastelloy X alloy , new metallic materials for SLM , have been further conducted to verify the model . 
Results confirm that the model can predict suitable laser energy densities needed for processing the various metallic materials without tedious trial and error experiments . 
Therefore , medical additive manufacturing techniques are developed for fabrication of such implants , but currently do not achieve the required printing resolution . 
This is caused by intensive droplet spreading of the initially liquid silicone rubber on the printing substrate . 
While empirical optimization approaches for the droplet spreading are intensive in cost and time , we develop a mathematical optimization approach to calculate the optimal printing parameters for minimal droplet spreading . 
Since the viscosity profile of thermal curing silicone rubber is the main reason for the droplet spreading , we implemented a rheology model for calculation of the optimal heat curing parameters . 
A Dual-Arrhenius equation was used to correlate the temperature-time-profile of the curing process with the curing-related viscosity rise and the temperature-related viscosity fall of the liquid silicone rubber . 
Two commonly used silicone rubbers were characterized with a rheometer at different isothermal and anisothermal curing profiles . 
High correlation between the calculated and the measured viscosity profiles were observed , giving the ability to optimize the curing process parameters to the rheological behaviour of the used silicone rubber . 
Powder bed fusion ( PBF ) is ideally suited to build complex and near-net-shaped metallic structures such as conformal cooling channel networks in injection molds . 
However , warpage occurring due to the residual stresses inherent to this process can lead to shape deviation in the internal channels and needs to be minimized . 
In this research , a novel analytical model based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam bending theory was developed to estimate the residual stress-induced deformation of internal channels printed horizontally using PBF . 
The proposed approach is thus expected to be a useful tool to generate design-for-AM guidelines for the additive manufacturing of overhangs and internal channels . 
Risk-averse areas such as the medical , aerospace and energy sectors have been somewhat slow towards accepting and applying Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) in many of their value chains . 
This is partly because there are still significant uncertainties concerning the quality of AM builds.This paper introduces a machine learning algorithm for the automatic detection of faults in AM products . 
The approach is semi-supervised in that , during training , it is able to use data from both builds where the resulting components were certified and builds where the quality of the resulting components is unknown . 
This makes the approach cost efficient , particularly in scenarios where part certification is costly and time consuming.The study specifically analyses Laser Powder-Bed Fusion ( L-PBF ) builds . 
Key features are extracted from large sets of photodiode data , obtained during the building of 49 tensile test bars . 
Ultimate tensile strength ( UTS ) tests were then used to categorise each bar as ‘ faulty ’ or ‘ acceptable ’ . 
As Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) adoption grows , the demand for improved quality output product is increasing . 
This is evident in the desire for both increased repeatability and higher strength and ductility in Selective Laser Sintered ( SLS® ) Polymer parts . 
One approach to expanding the performance envelope for polymers in this domain is through high temperature manufacturing processes , supporting the use of polymers with increased mechanical strength , lighter weight , and a favorable ability to sterilize for medical applications . 
Early candidate materials that exhibit higher melting and glass transition temperatures include the Poly Ether Ether Ketone ( PEEK ) and Polyaryletherketone ( PAEK ) family of materials . 
This paper describes the design of a laboratory SLS® machine for operation with these and other similar materials , emphasizing its thermal and operational design features . 
Data is also provided from initial testing of key subsystems during assembly and prior to full system operation . 
Because this machine is intended to explore processing new materials , it also incorporates features for improving the data collection , and associated feedback control for improved repeatability , and ultimately defect detection and mitigation during the Additive Manufacturing . 
One of the major challenges with the powder bed fusion process ( PBF ) and formation of bulk metallic glass ( BMG ) is the development of process parameters for a stable process and a defect-free component . 
The focus of this study is to predict formation of a crystalline phase in the glass forming alloy AMZ4 during PBF . 
The approach combines a thermal finite element model for prediction of the temperature field and a phase model for prediction of crystallization and devitrification . 
The challenge to simulate the complexity of the heat source has been addressed by utilizing temporal reduction in a layer-by-layer fashion by a simplified heat source model . 
The heat source model considers the laser power , penetration depth and hatch spacing and is represented by a volumetric heat density equation in one dimension . 
The phase model is developed and calibrated to DSC measurements at varying heating rates . 
It can predict the formation of crystalline phase during the non-isothermal process . 
Results indicate that a critical location for devitrification is located a few layers beneath the top surface . 
Nickel aluminium bronze ( NAB ) is widely used in naval applications due to its combination of excellent corrosion resistance in sea water applications and medium strength levels . 
These alloys have complex microstructures of α and β solid solution phases together with different forms of the intermetallic κ phase . 
In this work , selective laser melting ( SLM ) of Cu-9.8Al-5.2Ni-4.6Fe-0.3 Mn ( wt . 
% ) NAB powder was optimised to produce dense NAB specimens . 
The as-built specimens consisted of martensitic microstructures . 
Through the application of various heat treatment conditions , α + κ microstructures typical of traditional NAB alloys , were obtained and the mechanical and electrochemical properties were characterized . 
A heat treatment at 700 °C for 1 h on the as-built structure yielded NAB specimens with superior corrosion performance and mechanical properties than conventional wrought or cast NAB . 
This work shows that SLM of NAB alloys is possible and the components obtained exhibit properties at least as good as their cast or wrought counterparts . 
This opens up the possibility of using NAB components fabricated by SLM in engineering applications . 
Two batches of pre-alloyed Hastelloy-X powder with different Si , Mn and C contents were used to produce specimens by Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) . 
Two major reasons that control crack formation and propagation were considered : ( i ) internal strain accumulation due to the thermal cycling that is characteristic to SLM processing ; ( ii ) crack formation and propagation during solidification . 
This phenomenon , known as hot tearing , is frequently found in conventional casting and is dependent on chemical composition . 
Using thermodynamic software simulation , the temperature vs fraction of solid curves was used to determine hot tearing sensitivity as a function of Si , Mn and C content . 
It was found that low Si and C contents help in avoiding crack formation whereas cracking propensity was relatively independent of Mn concentration . 
Hence , the cracking mechanism during SLM is believed to be as follows : crack initiation is mainly induced during solidification and is dependent on the content of minor alloying elements such as Si and C , whereas crack propagation predominantly occurs during thermal cycling . 
If microstructures free of micro-cracks after solidification can be generated with optimised SLM parameters , these manufactured parts can sustain the internal strain level and , thus , crack formation and propagation can be avoided . 
Laser spatter is coarser and more spherical than virgin powder . 
Condensate condenses on the surfaces of laser spatter particles . 
Nano-oxide islands present on laser spatter coalesce to form large oxide islands . 
Condensate is created from a large amount of superheat in the melt pool . 
Heat-affected powder contains more delta ferrite than virgin powder . 
The selective laser melting process , commonly referred to as laser powder-bed fusion ( L-PBF ) , is an Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) technique that uses a laser to fuse successive layers of powder into near fully dense components . 
Due to the large energy input from the laser during processing , vaporization causes instabilities in the melt pool leading to the formation of laser spatter and condensate , collectively known as heat-affected powder . 
Since heat-affected powder settles into the powder bed , the properties of the unconsolidated powder may be altered compromising its reusability . 
In this study , characterization of 304 L heat-affected powder was performed through particle size and shape distribution measurements , energy-dispersive spectroscopy , Raman spectroscopy , inert gas fusion , metallography , and x-ray diffraction . 
The results show morphological , chemical , and microstructural differences between the virgin powder and heat-affected powder formed during processing which aid in the understanding of laser spatter and condensate that form in the L-PBF process . 
The impact of a rigid rod with a flat specimen fabricated of 3D-printed materials was analyzed . 
An experimental setup has been designed in order to capture the motion of the rod during the impact using a high-speed camera . 
Image processing algorithms were developed to estimate the velocity before and after the impact as well as the coefficient of restitution . 
Also , permanent deformations after the impact were scanned with an optical profilometer . 
In this work , a theoretical formulation for the contact force during the impact is proposed . 
The impact was divided into two phases , compression and restitution , in which materials considered elastic–plastic in the first and fully elastic in the second one . 
Results show a good correlation between the proposed formulation for the contact force and the behavior of materials . 
The objective of this work is to detect in situ the occurrence of lack-of-fusion defects in titanium alloy ( Ti-6Al-4 V ) parts made using directed energy deposition ( DED ) additive manufacturing ( AM ) . 
We use data from two types of in-process sensors , namely , a spectrometer and an optical camera which are integrated into an Optomec MR-7 DED machine . 
Both sensors are focused on capturing the dynamic phenomena around the melt pool region . 
To detect lack-of-fusion defects , we fuse ( combine ) the data from the in-process sensors invoking the concept of Kronecker product of graphs . 
Subsequently , we use the features derived from the graph Kronecker product as inputs to a machine learning algorithm to predict the severity ( class or level ) of average length of lack-of-fusion defects within a layer , which is obtained from offline X-ray computed tomography of the test parts . 
Accordingly , this work demonstrates the use of heterogeneous in-process sensing and online data analytics for in situ detection of defects in DED metal AM process . 
An extrusion-based additive manufacturing process , called the Ceramic On-Demand Extrusion ( CODE ) process , for producing three-dimensional ceramic components with near theoretical density is introduced in this paper . 
In this process , an aqueous paste of ceramic particles with a very low binder content ( < 1 vol % ) is extruded through a moving nozzle at room temperature . 
After a layer is deposited , it is surrounded by oil ( to a level just below the top surface of most recent layer ) to preclude non-uniform evaporation from the sides . 
Infrared radiation is then used to partially , and uniformly , dry the just-deposited layer so that the yield stress of the paste increases and the part maintains its shape . 
The same procedure is repeated for every layer until part fabrication is completed . 
Several sample parts for various applications were produced using this process and their properties were obtained . 
The results indicate that the proposed method enables fabrication of large , dense ceramic parts with complex geometries . 
This manuscript expands the existing framework for single-material laser powder bed fusion printed dissolvable supports to Inconel 718 ( IN718 ) . 
Prior work with stainless steel leveraged a sensitization heat treatment using sodium hexacyanoferrate to precipitate chromium carbides over the top 100 μm to 200 μm of material , decreasing the corrosion resistance within this top layer relative to the bulk material . 
The component is then etched at an anodic potential with a high selectivity toward the “ sensitized ” surface over the base component material . 
This creates an etching process that self-terminates once the sensitized layer is removed . 
Additionally , the surface roughness of the component is often improved once the sensitized region is removed . 
In this work , two different sensitization heat schedules were investigated : 750 °C for 24 h to understand the impact of preferential chromium carbide precipitation and 1050 °C for 8 h to understand the impact of primary carbide precipitations . 
At 1050 °C , the formation of a protective oxide scale inhibits material removal in an electrolyte of 0.48 M HNO3 . 
At 750 °C , 70 μm of material is removed after quenching to avoid the precipitation of corrosion resistant oxides . 
This manuscript investigates the effect of targeting different carbide precipitation regimes and oxides to produce an ideal microstructure for dissolvable supports post-sensitization . 
To demonstrate the utility of the process , the supports from a mock IN718 turbine blade were removed using this process . 
One of the next avenues for Additive Manufacturing to develop is that of multi-material deposition in order to add functionality to the already complex geometries that are capable of being manufactured . 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of solid surface tensions , σsg − σsl , on the quality of printed lines , using 30–40 nm silver nanofluid ink . 
The solid surface tensions of silver ink on glass and polytetrofluoroethylene ( PTFE ) substrates were determined theoretically , knowing characteristics of droplet . 
Meanwhile , a Dimatix printer with nozzles of size of 21.5 μm was used to print conductive lines on smooth glass and PTFE substrates . 
The printed lines on glass were observed to be continuous with high quality of triple line , which was attributed to the high solid surface tensions of silver nanofluid ink on glass substrates . 
The solid surface tensions of silver nanofluid ink were relatively low on PTFE , as results the printed lines were discontinuous . 
The solid surface tensions were introduced as a reliable criterion to predict the printability of nanofluids . 
The distribution of silver nanoparticles and layering phenomenon in silver nanofluid triple region on glass substrate was clearly observed , using environmental scanning electron microscopy ( ESEM ) for the first time . 
In addition to disjoining pressure , the size of droplet and affinity of nanofluid for substrate were observed to have important influences on spreading of nanoparticles in triple region . 
Manufacturers struggle to produce low-cost , robust and intricate components in small batches . 
Additive processes like Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) inexpensively generate such complex geometries , but potential defects may limit these components ’ viability in critical applications . 
We present a high-accuracy , high-throughput and low-cost approach to automated non-destructive testing ( NDT ) for FFF interlayer delamination . 
This Artificially Intelligent ( AI ) approach utilizes Flash Thermography ( FT ) data processed with Thermographic Signal Reconstruction ( TSR ) . 
A Deep Neural Network ( DNN ) attains 95.4 % per-pixel accuracy when differentiating four delamination severities 5 mm below the surface in PolyLactic Acid ( PLA ) widgets , and 98.6 % accuracy in differentiating acceptable from unacceptable states for the same components . 
Automation supports time- and cost-efficient inspection for delamination defects in 100 % of widgets , supporting FFF 's use in critical and lot-size one applications . 
To identify the dominant contributing factor in the anomalously high strength of Al–Si-based alloys fabricated by selective laser melting ( SLM ) , microstructural characteristics of a SLM-built Al–10Si–0.3 Mg alloy ( AlSi10Mg ) and their changes upon annealing at elevated temperatures were investigated . 
The as-built AlSi10Mg alloy exhibits a peculiar microstructure comprising of a number of columnar α-Al ( fcc ) phase with concentrated Si in solution . 
At elevated temperatures , a number of Si phase ( diamond structure ) precipitates consumed the solute Si in the columnar α-Al phase , but the microstructure of the α-Al matrix changed slightly . 
After annealing at elevated temperatures , the tensile strength of the as-built AlSi10Mg alloy substantially decreased accompanied by a reduction in the strain hardening rate . 
The supersaturated solid solution of the α-Al phase containing numerous nano-sized particles enhanced the strain hardening , resulting in the anomalous strengthening of the SLM-built AlSi10Mg alloy . 
The microstructural features were formed due to rapid solidification at an extremely high cooling rate in the SLM process , which provides important insights into controlling the strength of Al–Si-based alloys fabricated by SLM . 
The parametric design of graded porous scaffold based on TMPS surfaces was realized . 
The mechanical performance of SLM scaffolds was altered by tuning graded structures . 
Graded structure played a key role in influencing deformation behavior of scaffolds . 
Optimized heat treatment conditions improved mechanical properties of SLM scaffolds . 
The rapid development of additive manufacturing technology makes it possible to fabricate parts with complex inner structures , especially for functionally graded scaffolds ( FGS ) in the field of bone tissue engineering . 
The parametric design of FGS is of great significance to the in-depth study of the effects of structural parameters of porous bone scaffolds on their mechanical properties and rehabilitation of patients . 
The present study proposed a parametric design method for FGS using a triply periodic minimal surface ( TPMS ) . 
Uniform and functionally graded samples were fabricated using selective laser melting of Ti-6Al-4V powder . 
The FGSs successfully realized flexible control of structural parameters and showed comparable mechanical properties and permeability with natural bone tissue . 
Furthermore , heat treatment was verified to be an effective way to improve the ductility of TPMS-FGS . 
The deformation process and principal strain distribution of the FGSs were elucidated using a digital image correlation method . 
The FGSs proposed in the present study showed great potential in orthopedic implant or bone-substituting biomaterials . 
Processing of Ti6Al4V and SS410 as a bimetallic joint using laser-based directed energy deposition ( DED ) system . 
Niobium ( Nb ) was used as a bond layer between the two immiscible base-materials . 
The bimetallic joint showed improved bond strength , both under compression and shear loading . 
Proof-of-concept part demonstrated the application of the bimetallic joint by welding base metals , end-to-end , to the joint . 
Bimetallic structures provide a unique solution to achieve site-specific functionalities and enhanced-property capabilities in engineering systems but suffer from bonding compatibility issues . 
Materials such as titanium alloy ( Ti6Al4 V ) and stainless steel ( SS410 ) have distinct attractive properties but are impossible to reliably weld together using traditional processes . 
To this end , a laser-based directed energy deposition ( DED ) system was used to fabricate bimetallic joint of Ti6Al4 V and SS410 keeping niobium ( Nb ) as a diffusion barrier layer . 
Both shear and compression tests were used to characterize the joint ’ s strength , and compared with the base materials . 
The bimetallic-joint shear and compressive yield strengths were 419 ± 3 MPa ( ∼114 % of SS410 ) and 560 ± 4 MPa ( ∼169 % of SS410 ) , respectively . 
The increase in interfacial shear and compressive yield strengths over the base material indicates strong metallurgical bonding between the base materials and the interlayer , Nb . 
Proof-of-concept part for direct application of the bimetallic joint was demonstrated by welding base metals , end-to-end , to the joint . 
The interfacial microstructures , elemental diffusion and phases , including failure modes were examined using secondary and backscatter electron imaging , X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) and energy dispersive spectroscopy ( EDS ) . 
The bimetallic-joint interfaces were free from brittle intermetallic compounds such as FeTi and Fe2Ti that are generally responsible for weak bond strength . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) is widely gaining popularity as an alternative manufacturing technique for complex and customized parts . 
SLM is a near net shape process with minimal post processing machining required dependent upon final application . 
The fact that SLM produces little waste and enables more optimal designs also raises opportunities for environmental advantages . 
The use of aluminium ( Al ) alloys in SLM is still quite limited due to difficulties in processing that result in parts with high degrees of porosity . 
However , Al alloys are favoured in many high-end applications for their exceptional strength and stiffness to weight ratio meaning that they are extensively used in the automotive and aerospace industries . 
This study investigates the windows of parameters required to produce high density parts from AlSi10Mg alloy using selective laser melting . 
Modelling the thermal behaviour of the melt pool produced in Laser Powder-Bed Fusion ( L-PBF ) processes is not an easy task , as many complex non-linear thermal phenomena are involved . 
An effective way to make the computational cost of these analyses affordable is to model powder and molten metal as continuous media , wherein all the heat transfer modes occurring in the liquid are simulated as lumped fictitious heat conduction . 
The augmentation factor used to enhance the thermal conductivity of the liquid is in general calibrated through experimental estimations of the melt pool size . 
The present work is aimed at devising a robust method for the calibration of such thermal parameters . 
A specific point of novelty of the present paper is the definition of a method to correlate surface roughness and numerically predicted melting pool size . 
This strategy is able to predict with good accuracy the roughness of L-PBF fabricated parts and could pave the way for calibration strategies based on roughness measurements . 
For this purpose , a 3-factor , 3-level Design of Experiment ( DoE ) has been carried out to investigate melting pool size and roughness by changing the machine process parameters : laser power , hatch distance , time exposure . 
In this way , the calibration of the thermal properties is made less sensitive to the large uncertainty usually affecting the melt pool size measurements and the range of applicability of the thermal model is explored over a broad spectrum of L-PBF process parameters . 
Anisotropic and isotropic enhanced thermal conductivity approaches are applied in combination with a laser source modelled either as a 2D or 3D heat source , respectively . 
The latter approach proved to be more accurate and robust against experimental uncertainties . 
Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) , one of the most popular processes of 3D printing , offers flexibility in manufacturing and introduces anisotropic properties to the final parts . 
With the use of Curvilinear Variable Stiffness ( CVS ) 3D printing technology , mechanical properties of the manufactured products can be further improved and optimized . 
In this work , we demonstrate how CVS design can improve open-hole tensile strength and failure strain of the manufactured specimens per ASTM D5766 . 
In addition , the ratio of the specimen width to the hole diameter is considered as a design parameter and investigated . 
It is found that CVS design improves the failure strength by 38.0 % for a larger hole diameter configuration ( from 48.0 MPa to 66.2 MPa ) , while the improvement in failure strain ( from 0.0125 mm/mm to 0.0130 mm/mm ) is limited to only 4.0 % . 
On the other hand , for a smaller hole diameter case , a substantial improvement of 52.5 % in failure strain is obtained with the use of CVS design ( from 0.0141 mm/mm to 0.0215 mm/mm ) , while 16.7 % improvement in failure stress ( 76.0 MPa to 88.6 MPa ) is less pronounced . 
During part fabrication by laser powder-bed fusion ( L-PBF ) , an Additive Manufacturing process , a large amount of energy is input from the laser into the melt pool , causing generation of spatter and condensate , both of which have the potential to settle in the surrounding powder-bed compromising its reusability . 
In this study , AISI 304 L stainless steel powder is subjected to seven reuses in the L-PBF process to assess the changes in powder properties that occur as a result of successive recycling . 
The powder was characterized morphologically by particle size and shape distribution measurements , chemically through inert gas fusion for evaluation of oxygen content , and microstructurally by X-ray diffraction for phase identification . 
The evolution in powder properties was used to explain observed performance differences obtained by the Hausner ratio and a Revolution Powder Analyzer for quantifying flowability . 
The results show that recycled powder coarsens and becomes more spherical , accrues oxygen , and accumulates delta ferrite as it is reused . 
Due to the change in powder morphology , recycled powder exhibited improved flowability in comparison to the virgin powder . 
The energy per layer was found to be critical factor to print fully dense AlSi12 samples using SLM process . 
The printing area along the build direction varies when a sample is built in different orientations . 
The anisotropy of SLM-built samples corresponds to the variable energy per layer and printing area . 
Fully dense SLM-built AlSi12 samples were printed by using energy per layer in an optimum range . 
The anisotropy in the tensile properties of AlSi12 alloy fabricated using selective laser melting ( SLM ) additive manufacturing process was investigated . 
The tensile samples were printed in three different orientations , horizontal ( H - 0° ) , inclined ( I - 45° ) , and vertical ( V - 90° ) , and found to exhibit yield strength between 225 MPa and 263 MPa , tensile strength between 260 MPa and 365 MPa , and ductility between 1 and 4 % , showing distinct fracture patterns . 
It was established that the build orientation had insignificant effect on the microstructural characteristics of the SLM-printed samples , while XRD phase analysis showed variations in the Al ( 111 ) and Al ( 200 ) peak intensities . 
Consequently , the anisotropy in the mechanical properties of the SLM-printed AlSi12 samples was attributed to the differences in their relative density . 
Although the energy density was kept constant when printing the samples along different orientations , the “ energy per layer ” was found to be different owing to the variation in the printing area along the build direction . 
Further investigation on the effect of printing area , and correspondingly energy per layer , on the relative density was carried out . 
It was found that energy per layer in the range of 504–895 J yielded ≥99.8 % relatively dense AlSi12 SLM-printed samples . 
This study puts forth a new idea that the density of the SLM-printed samples could be controlled using energy per layer as an input process parameter . 
Polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ) is a polymer prized for its unique material properties , including a high resistance to corrosive acids such as HCL and HF and its piezoelectric potential based on the proper microstructure arrangement . 
In this work , the effects of fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) routine parameters on printed PVDF film properties were investigated using a variety of experimental methods . 
The influence of in-fill angle ( 0° , 45° , and 90° ) on the effective Young ’ s Modulus , Poisson ’ s ratio , and yield strength were evaluated using tensile testing and a digital image correlation ( DIC ) analysis . 
The phase content , in particular the β-phase amount , within the semi-crystalline PVDF films was determined as a function of processing parameters using the FTIR method . 
Considered parameters included the extrusion temperature , horizontal speed , in-situ applied hot end voltage , and bed material . 
Results showed that higher β-phase content was associated with lower extrusion temperatures , faster extrusion rates , and higher hot end voltages . 
New advancements in 3D printing enable manufacturing a solid part with spatially controlled and varying material properties ; this research seeks to establish techniques for finding optimal designs that use this new technology for the greatest structural benefit . 
We describe the use of a sequential quadratic programming based optimization solver to find an optimal distribution of material properties that minimize strain energy gradients , as calculated using finite element analysis . 
This design method is applied to the case of a flat thin plate with a hole , and has been proven to successfully reduce strain energy gradients and therefore stress concentrations . 
The optimally designed plates are 3D printed using a novel technology that uses vat polymerization technology . 
The computational model is validated with experiments . 
Enabling design engineers to customize material properties around geometric discontinuities will provide greater flexibility in reducing stress concentrations without modifying geometry or adding additional supports . 
Laser Engineered Net Shaping ( LENS ) is an additive manufacturing technique that belongs to the ASTM standardized directed energy deposition category . 
To date , very limited work has been conducted towards understanding the fatigue crack growth behavior of LENS fabricated materials , which hinders the widespread adoption of this technology for high-integrity structural applications . 
In this study , the propagation of a 20 μm initial crack in LENS fabricated Ti-6Al-4V was captured in-situ , using high-energy synchrotron x-ray microtomography . 
Fatigue crack growth ( FCG ) data were then determined from 2D and 3D tomography reconstructions , as well as from fracture surface striation measurements using SEM . 
The observed agreement demonstrates that x-ray microtomography and fractographic analysis using SEM can be successfully combined to study the propagation behavior of fatigue cracks . 
A finite element model of Laser Powder Bed Fusion ( LPBF ) process applied to metallic alloys at a mesoscopic scale is presented . 
This Level-Set model allows to follow melt pool evolution and track development during building . 
A volume heat source model is used for laser/powder interaction considering the material absorption coefficients , while a surface heat source is used to consider the high laser energy absorption by dense metal alloys . 
Shrinkage during consolidation from powder to dense material is modelled by a compressible Newtonian constitutive law . 
An automatic remeshing strategy is also used to provide a good compromise between accuracy and computing time . 
Different cases are investigated to demonstrate the influence of the vaporisation phenomena , of material properties and of laser scan strategy on bead morphology . 
Due to the layer-based nature of the powder bed fusion ( PBF ) process , part surfaces oriented in space at varying angles with respect to the build direction are differently affected by a wide array of manufacturing-induced phenomena ( staircase effects , spatter , particles , etc . 
For assessing surface topography of PBF surfaces most researchers have looked at surface texture parameters ( profile - ISO 4287 and areal - ISO 25178−2 ) . 
Texture parameters provide useful summaries of surface-wide properties , but do not allow the analysis to focus on specific topographic formations of interest . 
In this work , the topography of electron beam powder bed fusion ( EBPBF ) surfaces as a function of orientation with respect to the build direction was investigated using a combined approach consisting of both texture parameters and feature-based characterisation . 
A custom-designed test part featuring surfaces at different orientations was measured with a focus variation instrument . 
A feature-based characterisation pipeline was implemented for the identification , isolation and geometrical characterisation of spatter formations and particles present on the as-built surfaces . 
The surfaces deprived of the identified features were then characterised by means of conventional ISO 25178−2 texture parameters . 
The results confirm that combining feature-based characterisation with conventional analysis through texture parameters creates new perspectives for looking at EBPBF surfaces , thus better supporting future research endeavours aimed at achieving a more comprehensive insight on the nature of EBPBF surfaces . 
For the first time quantitative results are provided on number , shape and localisation of spatter and other particles in EBPBF surfaces as a function of build orientation , and texture parameters are provided that describe the fabricated surfaces in a more reliable way as particles and spatter formations have been removed . 
Unimodal powder samples were used in the laser sintering process . 
Different powder particle size and laser scan speeds were used . 
Microphotography , bulk density and tensile strength of artefact were measured . 
Neck size and strength were estimated with the Rumpf model for the strength of powder aggregates . 
Sintering temperatures were estimated with the Frenkel model for the effect of time on the sintering process . 
Selective Laser Sintering ( SLS ) of ceramic powders is studied in order to understand how the initial material properties and the process conditions affect the degree of sintering/melting and the mechanical properties of the sintered material . 
Unimodal powder samples of different narrow particle size distributions between 16 and 184 μm were sintered with a 40 W CO2 laser , using laser scan speeds of either 50 or 100 mm s−1 and , in both cases , a scanning energy of 160 J m−1 . 
The sintered material was studied by means of optical and SEM microphotography and characterized in terms of bulk density and tensile strength . 
The Rumpf approach to relate interparticle forces to the strength of powder agglomerates was used in this work to estimate the average strength of the sintered interparticle contacts starting from the tensile strength of specimens . 
In turn , the average strength of the neck contact was used to estimate the size of the neck of fused material between two sintered particles . 
These data coupled with the Frenkel model for particle sintering allowed an estimate of the sintering temperature for the different experimental conditions tested . 
The temperatures found are consistent with the glass transition temperature of the material used . 
The effect of particle size and scanning speed is assessed and discussed . 
The Z axis table motion errors and laser positioning errors an EOSINT M280 were evaluated using a set of standard metrology techniques and instrumentation . 
While the linear displacement error of the table is quite low ( 4.5 μm ) , straightness , yaw and pitch errors on the other hand were significantly higher and may contribute from 20 to 30 microns of form and orientation tolerances over a large size build.The performance of the laser positioning system was much worse . 
A designed artifact was produced , and used to evaluate the laser performance against a set of tolerance controls extracted from the ASME Y14.5-2009 Standard . 
The largest tolerance magnitude ( 239 μm ) was calculated as the combined effect of location , orientation , size and form errors in the trace of a large quadrifolium etched over the working area of the laser . 
The errors measured in this research are substantial . 
Selective laser melting was utilized to fabricate Sc and Zr modified Al-Mg alloy . 
Different precipitation behavior between various scan speeds are characterized by SEM and TEM . 
Significant improvement of hardness is evaluated and explained under a relative low scan speed . 
Relationships between scan speed , precipitate distribution , and the resultant mechanical properties are elucidated . 
The interest of selective laser melting ( SLM ) Al-based alloys for lightweight applications , especially the rare earth element Sc modified Al-Mg alloy , is increasing . 
In this work , high-performance Al-Mg-Sc-Zr alloy was successfully fabricated by SLM . 
The phase identification , densification behavior , precipitate distribution and mechnical properties of the as-fabricated parts at a wide range of processing parameters were carefully characterized . 
Meanwhile , the evolution of nanoprecipitation behavior under various scan speeds is revealed and TEM analysis of precipitates shows that a small amount of spherical nanoprecipitates Al3 ( Sc , Zr ) were embedded at the bottom of the molten pool using a low scan speed . 
While no precipitates were found in the matrix using a relatively high scan speed due to the combined effects of the variation of Marangoni convection vector , ultrashort lifetime of liquid and the rapid cooling rate . 
An increased hardness and a reduced wear rate of 94 HV0.2 and 1.74 × 10−4 mm3N-1 m-1 were resultantly obtained respectively as a much lower scan speed was applied . 
A relationship between the processing parameters , the surface tension , the convection flow , the precipitation distribution and the resultant mechanical properties has been well established , demonstrating that the high-performance of SLM-processed Al-Mg-Sc-Zr alloy could be tailored by controlling the distribution of nanoprecipitates . 
Continuous carbon nanotube ( CNT ) yarn filaments can be employed as an inherently multifunctional feedstock for additive manufacturing ( AM ) . 
With this material , it becomes possible to use a single material to impart multiple functionalities in components and take advantage of the tailorability offered by fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) over conventional fabrication techniques . 
Some of the challenges associated with coupling this emerging material with advanced processing are addressed here through the fabrication and characterization of additively manufactured functional objects . 
Continuous CNT yarn reinforced Ultem® specimens are characterized to determine their mechanical and electrical properties . 
The potential to produce net shape fabricated multifunctional components is demonstrated by additively manufacturing a quadcopter frame using Ultem® and continuous CNT yarn reinforced Ultem® , where the CNT yarn reinforcement was designed to also act as the electrical conductors carrying current to the motors . 
A computational modeling approach to simulate residual stress formation during the electron beam melting ( EBM ) process within the additive manufacturing ( AM ) technologies for Inconel 718 is presented in this paper . 
The EBM process has demonstrated a high potential to fabricate components with complex geometries , but the resulting components are influenced by the thermal cycles observed during the manufacturing process . 
When processing nickel based superalloys , very high temperatures ( approx . 
1000 °C ) are observed in the powder bed , base plate , and build . 
These high temperatures , when combined with substrate adherence , can result in warping of the base plate and affect the final component by causing defects . 
It is important to have an understanding of the thermo-mechanical response of the entire system , that is , its mechanical behavior towards thermal loading occurring during the EBM process prior to manufacturing a component . 
Therefore , computational models to predict the response of the system during the EBM process will aid in eliminating the undesired process conditions , a priori , in order to fabricate the optimum component . 
Such a comprehensive computational modeling approach is demonstrated to analyze warping of the base plate , stress and plastic strain accumulation within the material , and thermal cycles in the system during different stages of the EBM process . 
Parts made by fused filament fabrication differ in their mechanical properties from the parent material . 
To investigate the effect of the manufacturing process on the mechanical properties of 3D-printed parts , a series of experiments including Dynamic Mechanical Analysis ( DMA ) and ultrasonic wave propagation were conducted . 
For this purpose , printed parts were made from custom ABS filament and were printed using a rectangular bead shape to minimize porosity . 
The main properties investigated included the elastic , loss and storage moduli , and the material loss tangent ( tan δ ) . 
Results indicate that the elastic modulus of the printed material was somewhat lower than that of the parent material , about 2 GPa for frequencies 0.1 Hz–100 Hz . 
Droplet jetting behavior largely determines the final drop deposition quality in the inkjet printing process . 
Forming such behavior is governed by the fluid flow pattern . 
Therefore , a measurement of the flow pattern is of great importance for improving the printing quality of the inkjet printing process . 
Most of the current works use static images for the study of the drop evolution process . 
The problem of the static images is that the images can not recognize the motion information ( i.e. 
, temporal transformation ) of the droplet . 
Thus the information of the jetting process in the temporal domain will be lost . 
Instead of using the images , this paper takes the video data as the study subject to investigate the droplet evolution behavior in the inkjet printing process . 
Compared to most of the current learning approaches conducted in a supervised/semi-supervised manner for manufacturing process data , we propose an unsupervised learning method for studying the flow pattern of the droplet , which does not require well-defined ground-truth labels . 
Regarding the spatial and temporal transformation of the droplet in video data , we apply a deep recurrent neural network ( DRNN ) to implement the proposed unsupervised learning . 
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can learn latent representations of the droplet jetting process video data , which is very useful for the prediction of the droplet behavior . 
Furthermore , through latent space decoding , the learned representations can infer the droplet forming stimulus parameters such as material properties , which would be very helpful for further understanding of the process dynamics and achieving real-time in-situ droplet deposition quality monitoring and control . 
The surface of SLMed composite shows low roughness and high homogeneity . 
A phase transition from bcc martensite to fcc austensite appears with the addition of WC . 
Metallurgical bonding between reinforcement and matrix is realized . 
Tensile behavior of SLMed composite is different from that of SLMed maraging steel . 
In this work , tungsten carbide ( WC ) reinforced maraging steel matrix composites were in-situ manufactured by selective laser melting ( SLM ) from powder mixture . 
The SLM processed samples presented high relative density ( over 99 % ) with a homogenous distribution of WC . 
The as-fabricated surface quality of SLM processed samples was improved significantly by the addition of WC . 
Focused ion beam and transmission electron microscopy were employed to characterize the interfacial properties between tungsten carbide and steel matrix . 
The elemental analysis indicates that metallurgical bonding appears at interfacial region due to the diffusion . 
Tensile behavior of SLM processed maraging steel was different from their composite with several WC contents . 
To understand the fundamentals of microstructure formation in an electron beam melting ( EBM ) additive-manufacturing process , which is classified as a type of electron beam powder bed fusion ( EB-PBF ) in ISO562910/ASTM-F42 , single bead experiments were conducted by using an electron beam to scan an IN718 plate , using various combinations of power and scan speed , focusing on the relationship between ( i ) the beam irradiation level , ( ii ) the melt pool geometry , and ( iii ) the solidification microstructure . 
The width and depth of the melt pool increases almost linearly with the line energy . 
Elongated grains , which are generally called “ columnar grains ” were observed in almost the entire cross-section of the beads regardless of the process parameters . 
Temporal evolution of the temperature distribution for the single bead experiments was simulated by finite element analysis ( FEA ) with thermal conduction and recoalescence taken into account . 
The surface heat source model used in the simulation was modified to cause the geometry of the simulated melt pool to align with that which was observed experimentally . 
The distributions of the temperature gradient ( G ) and solidification rate ( R ) on the solidification interface were evaluated from the simulation results . 
The distributions of the microstructures were constructed from the distributions of G and R , as obtained from a solidification map in the literature . 
Contrary to the experimental observations , the constructed microstructure consisted mostly of equiaxed and mixed grains . 
While the volumetric energy density is commonly used to qualify a process parameter set , and to quantify its influence on the microstructure and performance of additively manufactured ( AM ) materials and components , it has been already shown that this description is by no means exhaustive . 
In this work , new aspects of the optimization of the selective laser melting process are investigated for AM Ti-6Al-4V . 
We focus on the amount of near-surface residual stress ( RS ) , often blamed for the failure of components , and on the porosity characteristics ( amount and spatial distribution ) . 
First , using synchrotron x-ray diffraction we show that higher RS in the subsurface region is generated if a lower energy density is used . 
Second , we show that laser de-focusing and sample positioning inside the build chamber also play an eminent role , and we quantify this influence . 
In parallel , using X-ray Computed Tomography , we observe that porosity is mainly concentrated in the contour region , except in the case where the laser speed is small . 
3D-printed Ti-6Al-4V components have great potential in the aerospace and biomedical industries . 
However , their wide application is limited by some inherent disadvantages , such as poor surface finish and high porosity . 
In this study , an innovative method , electrically-assisted ultrasonic nanocrystal surface modification ( EA-UNSM ) was introduced to process 3D-printed Ti-6Al-4V samples . 
The effect of EA-UNSM on surface finish , microstructure , porosity and in-depth hardness was investigated . 
Compared with the conventional UNSM process , smoother surfaces and lower subsurface porosities were obtained after EA-UNSM . 
Numerical modelling showed that localized heating occurs near the pores in 3D-printed Ti-6Al-4V subjected to electric current . 
This localized heating could potentially facilitate pore closure under ultrasonic striking . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) technology is a layer-wise powder-based additive manufacturing method capable of building 3D components from their CAD models . 
This approach offers enormous benefits for generating objects with geometrical complexity . 
However , due to the layer-wise nature of the process , surface roughness is formed between layers , thus influenced by layer thickness and other processing parameters . 
In this study , systematic research has been carried out to study the influence of processing parameters on surface roughness in Hastelloy X alloy . 
All samples were manufactured using an EOSINT M 280 machine . 
Laser power , scan speed , layer thickness and sloping angle of a surface were systematically varied to understand their effects on surface roughness . 
The arithmetic average roughness , Ra , was measured using a surface roughness tester , and optimum conditions for achieving the lowest roughness for both up-skin surfaces and down-skin surfaces have been obtained . 
The formation mechanism for the roughness on these two types of surfaces has been studied . 
Computer simulation was also used to understand thermal profiles at those two surfaces and their resultant influence on surface roughness . 
Contour scan and skywriting scan strategies were found to be helpful for reducing the surface roughness . 
Selective laser sintering ( SLS ) is a promising additive manufacturing technique , where powder particles are fused together under the influence of a laser beam . 
To obtain good material properties in the final product , the powder particles need to form a homogeneous melt during the fabrication process . 
On the other hand , you want the process to be as fast as possible . 
We developed a computational model based on the finite element method to study the material and process parameters concerning the melt flow of the powder particles . 
In this work , we restrict ourselves to varying the temperature-dependent viscosity , the process parameters , and the convective heat transfer coefficient of the sintering of two polymer ( polyamide 12 ) particles . 
The simulations allow for a quantitative analysis of the influence of the different material and processing parameters . 
From the simulations follows that an optimal sintering process has a low ambient temperature , a narrow beam width with enough power to heat the particles only a few degrees above the melting temperature , and a polymer of which the viscosity decreases significantly within these few degrees . 
Laser Engineered Net Shaping ( LENS™ ) was utilized to create novel silica ( SiO2 ) coatings onto commercially-pure titanium ( Cp-Ti ) . 
It was hypothesized that if silica could be deposited as a coating via laser surface engineering , high hardness and wear resistance could be added to existing Cp-Ti material . 
Post-deposition heat-treatments in the form of laser passes ( LP ) and a furnace residual-stress relief were completed on the coatings and mechanical/material properties were subsequently evaluated . 
Titanium silicide ( Ti5Si3 ) formation and related dendritic microstructures were identified throughout the coating by X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , energy dispersive spectroscopy ( EDS ) , scanning electron microscopic ( SEM ) analysis , and appeared more ordered after stress-relief heat treatment . 
High hardness values of approximately 1500 HV were measured at the coating ’ s topmost surface while specific wear rates showed a maximum 98 % reduction from 346.2 × 10−6 mm3/N-m in the Cp-Ti substrate to 7.1 × 10−6 mm3/N-m in the heat treated 1 LP coating . 
In situ tribofilm formation was observed during wear , which indicated self-healing properties from the material and likely aided further in wear reduction . 
Our results show that silica coating on titanium via laser surface engineering could be used as a suitable manufacturing practice to create hard , Ti5Si3-reinforced ceramic coatings with high wear resistance and self-healing properties for applications ranging from biomedical to aerospace . 
To increase the mechanical strength of Zircaloy-4 cladding at high temperatures , partial oxide dispersion-strengthened ( ODS ) treatment of the cladding tube surface was achieved by using laser processing technology . 
The microstructural characteristics and stability of the ODS layer formed on the Zircaloy-4 cladding surface were analyzed at temperatures up to 1000 °C . 
Ring tensile and loss-of-coolant accident ( LOCA ) simulation tests were performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of the surface ODS treated Zircaloy-4 cladding tube . 
The formation and uniform distribution of Y2O3 particles formed in the Zr matrix were identified , and the stability of the particles was confirmed up to 1000 °C . 
When compared to the reference Zircaloy-4 cladding tube , the surface ODS treated Zircaloy-4 cladding tube showed improved mechanical properties at both room temperature and 500 °C , as well as under LOCA simulation conditions . 
Material extrusion is an Additive Manufacturing process able to fabricate a physical object directly from a virtual model using layer by layer deposition of a thermoplastic filament extruded by a nozzle . 
The fabrication of functional components implies the need for the assembly with other parts with different properties in terms of material and surface quality . 
One of the most used assembly method involving plastic materials is the interference fit . 
It consists of fastening elements in which the two parts are pushed together , by means of a fit force , and no other fastener is necessary . 
It requires the accurate design of the interference , typically carried out by the designers through diagrams and theoretical formulations supplied by the material manufacturers . 
At present no theory has been provided for material extrusion parts due to the anisotropic behavior : the mesostructure , the surface roughness and the dimensional deviations mainly depend upon the build orientation.In this work the effects of the surface morphology and the interference grade on the assembly and disassembly forces in an interference fit joint are investigated . 
For the purpose , a design of experiment with a factorial plan has been carried out . 
Through this model it is possible to know in advance the force necessary to assemble a material extrusion part with an assigned interference grade . 
Fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) enables production of 3D objects over a range of material compositions at low-cost relative to traditional manufacturing approaches . 
To date , a limited but growing number of materials are able to be used with FFF , however many applications exist where specific mechanical , thermal , or chemical properties are needed that can not currently be met with the available feedstock selection . 
Therefore , a need exists to tune these materials for specific chemical or mechanical properties . 
One common formulation strategy to address these demanding design parameters is to develop composites or polymer blend filaments . 
This mixing occurs via software-controlled rotating hardware in the chamber of an extruder ’ s hot-end . 
The efficiency of mixing within the printed layers has been characterized in detail as a function of the rotational speed and geometry of the blending hardware . 
These parameters were exploited to program the ratio and distribution of thermoplastic-based filaments blended within printed extrudate . 
Example printed specimens were produced with thermoplastic polyurethane ( TPU ) elastomer blended with rigid polylactic acid ( PLA ) and Nylon blended with PLA . 
In addition , a conductive carbon nanotube ( CNT ) -PLA composite was blended as a function of mixer geometry and input feed ratios with non-conductive PLA and resistance values were measured across the resulting printed specimens . 
SLM fabricated Al-Mg-Sc-Zr alloy showed a heterogeneous grain structure . 
A good strength-ductility synergy was achieved in SLMed Al-Mg-Sc-Zr alloy . 
Strain partitioning among heterogeneous grain structure provided additional back stress hardening . 
In this work , a Sc/Zr modified Al-Mg alloy was processed by both selective laser melting ( SLM ) and directed energy deposition ( DED ) . 
Due to different precipitation behavior of primary Al3 ( Sc , Zr ) -L12 nucleation sites , a heterogeneous grain structure was formed in SLMed sample , which consisted of ultrafine equiaxed grains bands and columnar grains domains , while a fully equiaxed grain structure was obtained in DEDed sample . 
Tensile results showed that the as built SLMed sample had a good combination of strength and ductility . 
The yield strength of SLMed sample ( 335 ± 4 MPa ) was about 2.8 times that of DEDed sample ( 118 ± 3 MPa ) , however , the ductility in uniform elongation ( 23.6 ± 1.9 % ) was still comparable to that of DEDed sample ( 23.8 ± 2.6 % ) . 
Based on the relationship between the heterogeneous grain structure and strain hardening behavior , the strength-ductility synergy mechanism of the SLMed Al-Mg-Sc-Zr alloy was discussed . 
Stress partitioning tests showed that the contribution of back stress hardening to flow stress was higher in SLMed sample than DEDed sample , while effective stress hardening showed an opposite trend . 
Despite the overall strain hardening ability of SLMed sample was limited by the high dynamic recovery rate of ultrafine equiaxed grains , additional back stress hardening , which was caused by strain partitioning between equiaxed grains bands and columnar grains domains , improved its strain hardening ability and resulted in the good combination of strength and ductility . 
Silicone elastomers are of commercial interest in a number of areas because of their distinctive properties . 
Current 3D-printing ( additive manufacturing ) technologies for silicones mainly rely on the extrusion of high-viscosity pre-elastomer inks of one or two parts . 
Some of the challenges presented by high viscosity materials , for instance , difficulties in mixing and changing inks to create devices from more than one type of silicone , could be overcome by use of lower viscosity inks . 
Here we describe a family of rapidly curing ( shape holding within < 2 s , full cure in < 20 s ) , readily mixed , low-viscosity silicone inks using a combination of chain-extender , cross-linker , base polymer and photoinduced thiol-ene click chemistry . 
A key advantage of low viscosity is the facility to mix or change ink constituents , which facilitates changing inks , and the properties of the resulting cured materials . 
Microfluidic printheads and pneumatic control systems that switch rapidly between multiple inks , and then cure them using a UV exposure system , are also described . 
The combination of fast curing inks , and the printhead that extrudes and then cures them , allows 3D extrusion printing of low-viscosity silicone materials without the use of supporting material . 
The ability to print overhanging structures , discrete and continuous structures , as well as multimaterial structures using a single nozzle is demonstrated . 
The technology described here is scalable to produce higher resolution , multimaterial silicone structures that should find application in rapid prototyping and mold making . 
Continuous direct metal deposition in Z direction is carried out successfully . 
Superior austenite/ferrite dual phase microstructure is formed . 
Thin 316L stainless steel rods were fabricated by continuous directed energy deposition in Z direction . 
The process parameters ( laser power , scan velocity , and powder feeding rate ) were carefully selected to obtain a stable deposition process and the effects of powder feeding rate and scan velocity were studied . 
A preliminary study on microstructure and tensile properties of the specimens was carried out . 
Results indicated that the specimen showed superior austenite/ferrite ( γ/δ ) dual phase microstructure , high strength ( 608.24 MPa ) , and good plastic deformation capacity ( 65.08 % shrinkage rate ) when setting the laser power at 45.2 W , powder feeding rate at 2.81 g/min , and scan velocity at 0.5 mm/s . 
The technique reported in this paper is expected to lay the foundation for the deposition of wire or frame structures more efficiently than traditional layer-by-layer directed energy deposition . 
Thermal modeling of additive manufacturing processes such as laser powder bed fusion is able to calculate a thermal history of a build . 
This simulated thermal history can in turn be used as an input to further simulate temperature related characteristics such as residual stress , distortion , microstructure , lack of fusion porosity , and hot spots . 
In order to estimate the heat loss to the powder bed during the process , convective heat transfer is widely used as thermal boundary condition in finite element modeling of laser powder fusion processes . 
However , this convection coefficient is usually selected based on empirical estimation or model tuning . 
In this work , FEA models of the part and surrounding powder are used as a reference to determine the surface convection BC 's for modeling the part only . 
Seven types of commonly used AM materials with a wide range of thermal conductivities were studied for better testing of the conductivity dependency of the convection coefficient . 
The convection coefficient values , which predict similar thermal history as the powder model , are found to be a function of thermal conductivity of the deposited material and the cross-sectional thickness of the part feature . 
A new thickness dependent convection boundary condition is proposed and found to be capable of predicting much closer thermal history to the powder model . 
These newly developed boundary conditions improve the peak temperature prediction accuracy by 36 % while running in 1/4th of the time as the powder model . 
The computed tomography ( CT ) evaluation of the material extrusion ( MEX ) of a short carbon fiber ( SCF ) Nylon-12 filament and part is presented . 
CT , a non-destructive testing method , was used to quantify the internal structure of specimens into three phases : pore , Nylon , and SCF . 
The intensity histograms from the CT data were fit using a mixed skew-Gaussian distribution ( MSGD ) algorithm to segment the CT image into phases . 
Thresholded images were used to isolate pores in the CT image to determine pore volume and distribution within both the MEX SCF filament and part . 
The phase volume percentages of the MEX SCF filament were found to be 1.6 % pore , 62.2 % Nylon , and 36.2 % SCF . 
The volume of most pores within the filament were found to be under 100 μm3 . 
The highest frequency of pores was located near the outside of the filament , but the large pores were located near the center of the filament . 
This result indicates that the thermoplastic filament extrusion process likely entraps large bubbles in the center of filament or causes large thermal gradients and residual stresses that induce voids during post-extrusion cooling . 
MSGD analysis of sections of the MEX SCF part estimated phase volume percentages to be 9.8 % pore , 59.6 % Nylon , and 30.9 % SCF . 
For the MEX SCF part , the average pore area was found to be highest ( > 250 μm2 ) at the bottom of the layer and smallest ( < 100 μm2 ) at the top of the layer , which could be explained by a large temperature gradient between and contractile thermal stresses inside the layer that cause the thermoplastic to shrink into a smaller volume allowing the voids to grow during deposition . 
A qualitative analysis of fiber orientation conducted on the SCF filament indicated that the SCFs maintain their orientation from filament to part except in the intersection zone of rasters . 
In the quest to achieve functional 3D printed parts with open source machines and tools it is required to study all the error sources . 
Flow control is a major contributor to accuracy of parts manufactured additively with material extrusion and a precise filament feed rate is therefore essential . 
Filament slippage is measured in this work . 
The speed difference between filament feed gear speed and filament speed is measured with a cost effective , automated setup , using a low cost USB microscope video camera and image processing . 
The filament width is also measured simultaneously , allowing for real time volumetric flow rate estimation . 
Extrusion temperature and feed rate are found to influence the amount of slippage . 
Proof of concept closed loop control of the extruder is also implemented and reduces the amount of slippage considerably . 
In this paper we present the results of a study on the impact of a thin reflective film between the substrate and photoresin on the two-photon polymerization procedure . 
We have proposed a model for the elementary polymerization volume ( voxel ) formation for the introduced case and carried out simulations to examine the influence of the refractive indexes relation , layer thickness , roughness , and polymerization depth on the polymerization performance . 
The experiments on fabrication of 2D and 2.5D structures have shown the benefit of the proposed configuration for the substrate/photoresin interface localization as well as for the distortion-free fabrication . 
Directed energy deposition ( DED ) is a promising technique for cladding and repair due to its ability to deposit molten metal onto existing surfaces . 
To date , much still needs to be understood regarding the microstructure evolution during DED . 
The work herein seeks to reveal the effect of build height on mechanical properties and corrosion for austenitic stainless steel 316L . 
A large 316L block was fabricated via DED and horizontal tensile specimens were taken from every 3 mm along the build height in order to assess the effect of build height on the mechanical response . 
Electron backscatter diffraction mapping was also conducted on sections taken from the bottom , middle and top heights of the build , to assess the microstructural evolution . 
Cyclic polarisation testing was performed on sections from the build to assess the pitting potential and re-passivation as a function of build height . 
Parameters for selective laser melting of Zr59.3Cu28.8Al10.4Nb1.5 ( trade name AMZ4 ) , allowing crack-free bulk metallic glass with low porosity , have been developed . 
The phase formation was found to be strongly influenced by the heating power of the laser . 
X-ray amorphous samples were obtained with laser power at and below 75 W. The as-processed bulk metallic glass was found to devitrify by a two-stage crystallization process within which the presence of oxygen was concluded to play an essential role . 
At laser powers above 75 W , the observed crystallites were found to be a cubic phase ( Cu2Zr4O ) . 
The hardness and Young ’ s modulus in the as-processed samples was found to increase marginally with increased fraction of the crystalline phase . 
Large-scale printing technology is proposed for non-metallic lightning protection . 
The printing process integrates continuous carbon fiber and E-Beam irradiation curing . 
Low-energy E-Beam is applied for fast and low-temperature curing adequacy of print . 
Regarding impregnation of epoxy , the fiber content of this printing reached 58 wt % . 
Continuous fiber mesh provides comparative protection as commercial copper mesh . 
Wind-turbine blades are more vulnerable to lightning strikes as they lack a protection system for large-scale glass fiber reinforced polymer ( GFRP ) composite structures . 
A low-energy electron beam ( EB ) cured printing process for fabricating a continuous carbon fiber-reinforced thermoset resin as a non-metallic lightning protection mesh on a GFRP composite surface was carried out in this study . 
During the proposed process , a continuous carbon fiber mesh was printed through a Fused Filament Fabrication that integrates the rapid curing of an epoxy resin with low-energy EB irradiation . 
The printing process was analyzed and optimized by examining the correlation between the EB exposure dose and the printing height . 
Results from artificial lightning strikes showed that the printed carbon fiber mesh prevented damage , and the structure remained relatively intact with residual strength reaching 90.1 % at 100 kA maximum peak current . 
The protection mechanism was investigated using a high-speed camera , which revealed that the carbon fiber mesh spreads the striking current outside the laminate instead of penetrating inside . 
In selective laser melting ( SLM ) products are built by melting layers of metal powder successively . 
Optimal process parameters are usually obtained by scanning single vectors and subsequently determining which settings lead to a good compromise between product density and build speed . 
This paper proposes a model that describes the effects occurring when scanning single vectors . 
Energy absorption and heat conduction are modeled to determine the temperature distribution and melt pool characteristics for different laser powers , scan speeds and layer thicknesses . 
The model shows good agreement with experimentally obtained scan vectors and can therefore be used to predict SLM process parameters . 
This research investigates the microstructure , mechanical , residual stress and tribological properties of as-printed Inconel 718 by laser powder bed fusion . 
The microstructure exhibits a hierarchical structure composed of melt pool boundaries and directionally solidified columnar thin dendrites . 
No significant size of defects or undesirable phases such as Laves phases or macrosegregation was found in the microstructure . 
The Vickers microhardness results did not show any significant differences in hardness value across the tracks and layers of melt pool boundaries . 
The hot tribological behaviour of the alloy was investigated for the range of temperatures ( 28 °C , 400 °C , 500 °C and 600 °C ) in a high temperature pin ( Inconel 718 ) on disc ( EN31 steel ) set up . 
The worn surface and loose wear debris were analysed with the aid of SEM/EDS and XRD analysis . 
The wear loss and friction coefficient increase with the test temperature . 
The friction results show the running-in-period and steady-state-period for the high temperature cases . 
The abrasion wear is predominant at 28 °C . 
In contrast , delamination wear and oxidation wear are dominant for high temperature cases . 
The observation of high friction and wear loss with the test temperature is attributed to the increased intensity of delamination wear and oxidation rate of non-lubricative NiO . 
The wear debris size increases with the test temperature and the shape has undergone changes from short angular to long angular sheets . 
Single-pass depositions of columnar René 142 on investment cast single-crystal ( SX ) René N5 substrates having [ 100 ] and [ 001 ] primary dendrite growth directions were obtained through scanning laser epitaxy ( SLE ) , a laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) -based additive manufacturing ( AM ) process . 
The microstructure and the microhardness properties of the René 142 deposits were investigated through high-resolution optical microscopy ( HR-OM ) , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy ( EDS ) , x-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , electron backscatter diffraction ( EBSD ) , and micro-hardness measurements . 
SEM investigations demonstrated that the primary γ/γ′ precipitates in the deposit region were 90 % finer in size compared to the substrate . 
Microhardness measurements showed an increase in the hardness values by ∼10 % in the deposit region compared to the cast substrate . 
The results showed that the SLE process has tremendous potential in producing epitaxial deposits of nickel-based superalloys and , therefore , the findings reported in this work can pave ways to fabricate components with dissimilar-chemistry high-γ′ nickel-based superalloys using an LPBF-based AM process . 
Neutron diffraction study of poly-crystalline bulk samples of Ti-6Al-4V , prepared using selective laser melting ( SLM ) and electron beam melting ( EBM ) , and of their ingredient powders , is reported . 
Both the SLM and EBM samples do not contain the macro- and micro-strain , found in the ingredient powder particles . 
In addition , the micro-structure of the EBM sample is found free of preferential orientation , whereas in the SLM sample significant preference towards the hexagonal basal plane is found . 
Hot-rolled Inconel 718 showed superior creep performance to LPBF Inconel 718 . 
HIPing worsened creep life and HT improved creep life of LPBF Inconel 718 . 
Intergranular precipitation in the HIP ’ d samples explained worse creep performance . 
Hot-rolled samples avoided intergranular fracture . 
In this study , the creep performance of laser powder bed fusion manufactured Inconel 718 specimens is studied in detail and compared with conventional hot-rolled specimens alongside as-built then heat-treated and as-built then hot-isostatic pressed specimens . 
Hot-rolled specimens showed the best creep resistance , while the hot-isostatic pressed specimens yielded the worst performance , inferior to the as-built condition . 
Creep testing of all samples showed increased secondary creep rate was consistently correlated with a reduced life . 
Fractography revealed intergranular fracture was the primary failure mode for all as-built samples . 
Preferential intergranular precipitation in the case of the hot-isostatic pressed specimens during hot-isostatic pressing extensive intergranular cracking as the primary failure mechanism . 
Heat-treated specimens possessed only sparse intergranular precipitates , thereby explaining an improved creep lifetime . 
The hot-rolled specimens , having smallest grain size , showed the least extensive cracking , particularly in locations of finest grains , explaining avoidance of intergranular fracture as a key creep mechanism , thereby explaining the ductile creep fracture surfaces in the case of the hot-rolled samples . 
The build-up of residual stresses in a part during laser powder bed fusion provides a significant limitation to the adoption of this process . 
These residuals stresses may cause a part to fail during a build or fall outside the specified tolerances after fabrication . 
In the present work a thermomechanical model is used to simulate the build process and calculate the residual stress state for Ti–6Al–4V specimens built with continuous and island scan strategies . 
A material model is developed to naturally capture the strain-rate dependence and annealing behavior of Ti–6Al–4V at elevated temperatures . 
Results from the thermomechanical simulations showed good agreement with synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements used to determine the residual elastic strains in these parts . 
However , the experimental measurements showed higher residual strains for the specimen built with an island scan strategy ; a trend not fully captured by the simulations . 
Parameter studies were performed to fully understand the advantages and limitations of the current simulation methodology . 
Using defocus can lead to a stable SLM process with high build rates . 
Melt pool morphology can be predicted by normalized enthalpy and Rosenthal equation Melt pool depth is more influenced by defocusing than its width . 
Despite its many benefits , Selective Laser Melting 's ( SLM ) relatively low productivity compared to deposition-based additive manufacturing techniques is a major drawback . 
Increasing the laser beam diameter improves SLM 's build rate , but causes loss of precision . 
The aim of this study is to investigate laser beam focus shift , or “ defocus ” , using a dynamic focusing unit , in order to increase the laser spot size . 
When applied to the SLM process , focus shift can be integrated into a “ hull-core ” strategy . 
This involves scanning the core with a high productivity parameter set using defocus while enabling return to the focused smaller spot size position for hull scanning . 
To assess the process stability , single line scans were made from 316L stainless steel powder . 
The consolidated melt pool morphology was analyzed and correlated with the process parameters comprising laser power , scanning speed and defocus distance . 
In order to link the melt pool morphology with the heat input , Volumetric Energy Density , Normalized Enthalpy and Rosenthal equation were considered . 
The suitability of using the Normalized Enthalpy as a design parameter to predict the melt pool depth and Rosenthal equation to predict its width was highlighted . 
This study shows that within a single laser setup , implementing defocus can lead to a potential productivity increase by 840 % , i.e . 
New generation of selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) machines are evolving towards higher power lasers as well as multi laser systems in order to increase the productivity . 
The increase in laser power and the modification of the laser power distribution leads to microstructural and mechanical property variations that are still not well understood.This work aims at better understanding the interaction of a 1 kW top-hat power distribution laser on a well know material , 316 L stainless steel . 
The influence of texture and microstructure on relative density and crack density , when varying scan rotation , was evaluated . 
The high power ( HP ) laser and low power ( LP ) laser were compared with respect to microstructure and mechanical properties . 
HP leads to an increase in morphological and crystallographic texture together with a coarsening of the cell structure in contrast to the more random and finer cells found in LP processed material . 
Hot isostatic pressing was applied as a post-process treatment in order to close remaining pores and cracks . 
This helped in achieving higher elongations for LP and HP processed materials , while competitive mechanical properties to the 316 L material specifications were obtained in both cases . 
Laser sintering ( LS ) of polymer materials is a process that has been developed over the last two decades and has been applied in industries ranging from aerospace to sporting goods . 
However , one of the current major limitations of the process is the restricted range of usable materials . 
Various material characteristics have been proposed as being important to optimise the laser sintering process , key aspects of which have been combined in this work to develop an understanding of the most crucial requirements for LS process design and materials selection . 
Using the favourable characteristics of polyamide-12 ( the most often used material for laser sintering ) as a benchmark , a previously un-sintered thermoplastic elastomer material was identified as being suitable for the LS process , through a combination of information from Differential Scanning Calorimetry ( DSC ) , hot stage microscopy ( HSM ) and knowledge of viscosity data . 
Subsequent laser sintering builds confirmed the viability of this new material , and tensile test results were favourable when compared with materials that are currently commercially available , thereby demonstrating the efficacy of the chosen selection process . 
Selective laser melting is already established as a commercial production technique . 
In-situ process monitoring is a promising means to accommodate this issue , but quantitative correlations between monitoring signals and actual part defects have been lacking . 
In this paper , results are presented that have been obtained with an off-axis melt pool monitoring system on a 3D Systems ProX DMP 320 using Ti-6Al-4 V ELI . 
The focus is on the development of a method for predicting the presence and location of lack of fusion porosities as they can have a large impact on part quality and are not always easily detected post-build . 
The processed signals from the monitoring system are shown to have a high degree of correlation with the presence of lack of fusion porosities as measured by CT scans . 
A prediction sensitivity of 90 % for lack of fusion events in the range of pores having a volume greater than 0.001 mm3 , roughly equivalent to 160 μm in diameter , was obtained . 
Relationships between prior beta grain size in solidified Ti-6Al-4V and melting process parameters in the Electron Beam Melting ( EBM ) process are investigated . 
Samples are built by varying a machine-dependent proprietary speed function to cover the process space . 
Optical microscopy is used to measure prior beta grain widths and assess the number of prior beta grains present in a melt pool in the raster region of the build . 
Despite the complicated evolution of beta grain sizes , the beta grain width scales with melt pool width . 
The resulting understanding of the relationship between primary machine variables and prior beta grain widths is a key step toward enabling the location specific control of as-built microstructure in the EBM process . 
The selective laser melting ( SLM ) process is used throughout the world . 
This process is based on the continuous ( layer by layer ) surfacing of metallic powder which is fused by laser or high-power electron beam . 
In this paper is presented studies of the structure of a nickel alloy ( EP718 ) component formed using the SLM process , and the effects of heat treatment and hot isostatic pressing ( HIP ) on the mechanical properties of samples manufactured by SLM technology . 
Mechanical tests have shown that components formed using SLM exhibit a low level of strength but with a high degree of plasticity . 
Subsequent heat treatment led to an increase in strength and a corresponding reduction in plasticity owing to the formation of reinforcing particles of molybdenum silicides and an incomplete relaxation , with low grain growth . 
However , a combination of SLM + HIP + heat treatment resulted in optimum levels of strength and plasticity in comparison with other samples . 
In this work , 3D cubic test specimens were manufactured by Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) from commercially available Ni/Fe-based superalloy powder , and were further subjected to heat treatment . 
The evolution of their microstructure , phase composition and microhardness were analysed in relation to the applied heat-treatment procedure.Parametric study of the SLM process allows determination of a suitable parametric set for obtaining of 3D objects from the Ni/Fe-based single-crystal superalloy Thymonel-2 , with the resulting porosity of 0.35 % .The manufactured 3D specimens were subjected to three different heat-treatment procedures . 
The microstructure and the phase composition of the as-manufactured and the heat-treated samples were analysed in order to study the microstructure-microhardness correlation of Thymonel-2.XRD analysis of the as-manufactured samples reveals the presence of the fcc γ- ( Fe , Ni ) phase only . 
The literature reports a considerable amount of γ′ phase in Ni/Fe-based superalloys processed by conventional metallurgy . 
The absence of the γ′ can be explained by extremely high cooling rates during SLM which prevents precipitation . 
Post heat-treatment of the specimens leads to significant changes in microstructure and the resulting 30–90 % increase in microhardness.Recommendations on SLM strategy and post heat-treatment of Thymonel-2 are provided . 
This work presents a novel modeling framework combining computational fluid dynamics ( CFD ) and cellular automata ( CA ) , to predict the solidification microstructure evolution of laser powder bed fusion ( PBF ) fabricated 316 L stainless steel . 
A CA model is developed which is based on the modified decentered square method to improve computational efficiency . 
Using this framework , the fluid dynamics of the melt pool flow in the laser melting process is found to be mainly driven by the competing Marangoni force and the recoil pressure on the liquid metal surface . 
Evaporation occurs at the front end of the laser spot . 
The initial high temperature occurs in the center of the laser spot . 
However , due to Marangoni force , which drives high-temperature liquid flowing to low-temperature region , the highest temperature region shifts to the front side of the laser spot where evaporation occurs . 
Additionally , the recoil pressure pushes the liquid metal downward to form a depression zone . 
The simulated melt pool depths are compared well with the experimental data . 
Additionally , the simulated solidification microstructure using the CA model is in a good agreement with the experimental observation . 
The simulations show that higher scan speeds result in smaller melt pool depth , and lack-of-fusion pores can be formed . 
Higher laser scan speed also leads to finer grain size , larger laser-grain angle , and higher columnar grain contents , which are consistent with experimental observations . 
This model can be potentially used as a tool to optimize the metal powder bed fusion process , through generating desired microstructure and resultant material properties . 
We report our efforts toward 3D printing of polyether ether ketone ( PEEK ) at room temperature by direct-ink write technology . 
The room-temperature extrusion printing method was enabled by a unique formulation comprised of commercial PEEK powder , soluble epoxy-functionalized PEEK ( ePEEK ) , and fenchone . 
This combination formed a Bingham plastic that could be extruded using a readily available direct-ink write printer . 
The initial green body specimens were strong enough to be manipulated manually after drying . 
After printing , thermal processing at 230 °C resulted in crosslinking of the ePEEK components to form a stabilizing network throughout the specimen , which helped to preclude distortion and cracking upon sintering . 
The final parts were found to have excellent thermal stability and solvent resistance . 
The Tg of the product specimens was found to be 158 °C , which is 13 °C higher than commercial PEEK as measured by DSC . 
Moreover , the thermal decomposition temperature was found to be 528 °C , which compares well against commercial molded PEEK samples . 
Chemical resistance in trifluoroacetic acid and 8 common organic solvents , including CH2Cl2 and toluene , were also investigated and no signs of degradation or weight changes were observed from parts submerged for 1 week in each solvent . 
Test specimens also displayed desirable mechanical properties , such as a Young ’ s modulus of 2.5 GPa , which corresponds to 63 % of that of commercial PEEK ( reported to be 4.0 GPa ) . 
Due to the relative youth of metallic powder bed additive manufacturing technologies and difficulties with monitoring the process in situ , there is little consensus in the user community on how to optimize user variable parameters to ensure the highest quality and most cost effective build . 
Temperature distribution is the critical factor that dictates melting , microstructure and eventually the final part quality . 
Monitoring or measuring the temperature during the process is extremely difficult due to the ultra-high speeds and microscale size of the laser or electron beam . 
Therefore , other tools such as finite element modeling can be utilized to optimize these processes and predict the behavior of the system for different materials . 
This research presents transient , dynamic finite element model of the build process for both laser and electron beam melting techniques . 
The model includes melting and solidification of the powder as well as different thermal aspects such as conduction and radiation . 
Diffusivity of the powder is modeled and phase change is modeled such that latent heat of fusion is considered . 
Melt pool geometry and temperature distribution was obtained for different heat sources and different materials such as Ti6Al4V , Stainless Steel 316 , and 7075 Aluminum powders . 
It was determined that heat accumulation is most consolidated within titanium powder beds , with steel being the second most consolidated , and aluminum powder beds having the most heat dissipation . 
As a result , titanium was seen to exhibit the highest local temperatures and largest melt pools , followed by steel and aluminum in decreasing order . 
Naturally , laser models showed smaller melt pool sizes and depths due to lower power . 
The beam speed and power used for Ti were found inadequate for creating a sustained and continuous melting of Al and Steel . 
Therefore , adjustments were made to these parameters and presented in this research . 
An effective liquid conductivity approach has been developed to describe the convective transport modes existing within the melt pool in powder bed additive manufacturing processes . 
A first principles approach is introduced to derive an effective conductive transport mode that encompasses conduction and advection within the melt pool . 
A modified Bond number was calculated by comparing surface tension forces with viscous forces within the melt pool region . 
It was determined , due to the small size scale of melt pools in powder bed processes , that the surface tension gradient driven flow , or the Marangoni effect , is the dominant mass transport phenomenon within the melt pool . 
Validation was conducted by comparing simulation melt pool widths and depths against experimental measurements for Inconel 718 built at beam powers of 150 W , 200 W and 300 W and a scan speed of 200 mm/s . 
By introducing the effective liquid conductivity , simulated melt pool widths were up to 50 % closer to experimental widths and simulated melt pool depths were up to 80 % closer to experimental measurements . 
Analytic temperature profiles and melt pool dimensions are compared between Ti6Al4V , Stainless Steel 316L , Aluminum 7075 and Inconel 718 built with similar process parameters , while including effective liquid conductivity . 
The reasons for differences in temperature and melt pool geometry are discussed . 
Experimental measurements are a critical component of model development , as they are needed to validate the accuracy of the model predictions . 
Currently , there is a deficiency in the availability of experimental data for laser powder bed fusion made parts . 
Here , two experimental builds of cylindrical geometry , one using a rotating scan pattern and the other using a constant scan pattern , are designed to provide post-build distortion measurements . 
Measurements show that for these cylindrical thin wall builds , there is no discernable effect on distortion from using the rotating versus constant scan patterns . 
Project Pan finite element modeling software is used to model each of the experimental builds . 
The simulation results show good agreement with experimental measurements of post-build deformation , within a 12 % percent error as compared to experimental measurements . 
Using the FE model , the effect of a flexible versus a rigid substrate on distortion profile is examined . 
The FE model is validated against in situ experimental measurements of substrate distortion . 
The simulated results are used to study stress and distortion evolution during the build process . 
Internal stresses calculated by the model throughout the part are used in explaining the final part distortion . 
The combination of experimental and simulation results from this study show that the distortion of the top layer is relatively small ( less than 30 % ) throughout the duration of the build process compared to the peak distortion , which occurs several layers below the most recently deposited layer . 
Designing metallic cellular structures with triply periodic minimal surface ( TPMS ) sheet cores is a novel approach for lightweight and multi-functional structural applications . 
Different from current honeycombs and lattices , TPMS sheet structures are composed of continuous and smooth shells , allowing for large surface areas and continuous internal channels . 
In this paper , we investigate the mechanical properties and energy absorption abilities of three types of TPMS sheet structures ( Primitive , Diamond , and Gyroid ) fabricated by selective laser melting ( SLM ) with 316 L stainless steel under compression loading and classify their failure mechanisms and printing accuracy with the help of numerical analysis . 
Experimental results reveal the superior stiffness , plateau stress and energy absorption ability of TPMS sheet structures compared to body-centred cubic lattices , with Diamond-type sheet structures performing best . 
Nonlinear finite element simulation results also show that Diamond and Gyroid sheet structures display relatively uniform stress distributions across all lattice cells under compression , leading to stable collapse mechanisms and desired energy absorption performance . 
Parts manufactured by laser powder bed fusion contain significant residual stress . 
This stress causes failures during the build process , distorts parts and limits in-service performance . 
A pragmatic finite element model of the build process is introduced here to predict residual stress in a computationally efficient manner . 
The part is divided into coarse sections which activate at the melting temperature in an order that imitates the build process . 
Temperature and stress in the part are calculated using a sequentially coupled thermomechanical analysis with temperature dependent material properties . 
The model is validated against two sets of experimental measurements : the first from a bridge component made from 316L stainless steel and the second from a cuboidal component made from Inconel 718 . 
For the bridge component the simulated distortion is within 5 % of the experimental measurement when modelled with a section height of 0.8 mm . 
This is 16 times larger than the 50 μm layer height in the experimental part . 
For the cuboid component the simulated distortion is within 10 % of experimental measurement with a section height 10 times larger than the experiment layer height . 
These results show that simulation of every layer in the build process is not required to obtain accurate results , reducing computational effort and enabling the prediction of residual stress in larger components . 
A mesoscale multi-physics model is developed to simulate rapid solidification . 
Solute transport , phase transition , heat transfer , latent heat , and melt flow are modeled . 
Powder bed fusion is a recently developed additive manufacturing ( AM ) technique for alloys , which builds parts by selectively melting metallic powders with a high-energy laser or electron beam . 
Nevertheless , there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of the rapid solidification process for better quality control . 
To simulate the microstructure evolution of alloys during the rapid solidification , in this research , a mesoscale multi-physics model is developed to simultaneously consider solute transport , phase transition , heat transfer , latent heat , and melt flow . 
In this model , the phase-field method simulates the dendrite growth of alloys , whereas the thermal lattice Boltzmann method models heat transfer and fluid flow . 
The simulation results of Ti-6Al-4V show that the consideration of latent heat is necessary because it reveals the details of the formation of secondary arms and provides more realistic kinetics of dendrite growth . 
The proposed multi-physics simulation model provides new insights into the complex solidification process in AM . 
Relationship between laser energy density and thermal expansion was explained . 
Critical laser energy density exists for each material . 
Void formation and alloying element vaporization occurred during selective laser melting of Ni- and Fe-based alloys . 
Magnetic properties and thermal expansion coefficients of parts produced were quantified . 
Process window was determined for Invar 36 and stainless steel 316 L based on stable melting . 
This paper presents an experimental study on the metallurgical issues associated with selective laser melting of Invar 36 and stainless steel 316 L and the resulting coefficient of thermal expansion . 
Invar 36 has been used in aircraft control systems , electronic devices , optical instruments , and medical instruments that are exposed to significant temperature changes . 
Stainless steel 316 L is commonly used for applications that require high corrosion resistance in the aerospace , medical , and nuclear industries . 
Both Invar 36 and stainless steel 316 L are weldable austenitic face-centered cubic crystal structures , but stainless steel 316 L may experience chromium evaporation and Invar 36 may experience weld cracking during the welding process . 
Various laser process parameters were tested based on a full factorial design of experiments . 
The microstructure , material composition , coefficient of thermal expansion , and magnetic dipole moment were measured for both materials . 
It was found that there exists a critical laser energy density for each material , EC , for which selective laser melting process is optimal for material properties . 
The critical laser energy density provides enough energy to induce stable melting , homogeneous microstructure and chemical composition , resulting in thermal expansion and magnetic properties in line with that expected for the wrought material . 
Below the critical energy , a lack of fusion due to insufficient melt tracks and discontinuous beads was observed . 
The melt track was also unstable above the critical energy due to vaporization and microsegregation of alloying elements . 
Both cases can generate stress risers and part flaws during manufacturing . 
These flaws could be avoided by finding the critical laser energy needed for each material . 
The critical laser energy density was determined to be 86.8 J/mm3 for Invar 36 and 104.2 J/mm3 for stainless steel 316 L. The present study investigated the effects of set radius of curvature and fiber bundle size on the precision of the radius of curvature during continuous carbon fiber three-dimensional ( 3D ) printing . 
First , individual circles with various radii using various sizes of fiber bundles were printed with a 3D printer . 
It was demonstrated that with a larger fiber bundle size or a smaller set radius , the printed radius would be lower than the set value . 
Equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi HEA was successfully fabricated by SLM . 
The XRD profiles of the SLM-CoCrFeMnNi HEA were refined by the Rietveld program . 
The effect of the peak load on the creep deformation was investigated by nanoindentation with a Berkovich indenter . 
The creep was mainly dominated by deformation controlled by dislocation motion . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) was used to fabricate an equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy ( HEA ) . 
The SLM-fabricated CoCrFeMnNi HEA samples were studied with X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , field-emission scanning electron microscopy ( FESEM ) , electron backscatter diffraction ( EBSD ) and nanoindentation techniques to characterize the microstructure and creep behavior . 
It was found that the HEA comprised a single face-centered cubic ( fcc ) structure . 
Due to the fast solidification and high temperature gradients of the molten pool during the SLM process , the microstructure comprised cellular subgrains with grain boundary angles lower than 5° . 
Moreover , the effect of the peak holding load on the nanoindentation creep deformation of the SLM-fabricated HEA was investigated using a Berkovich indenter . 
The results of this study indicated that the creep was mainly dominated by deformation controlled by dislocation motion . 
Spatter distribution on AlSi10Mg powder bed was quantified in terms of mass , size and processed images . 
Established vision methodology showed moderate positive relationship with quantified mass of spatter . 
Spatter mass and size distributions could serve as ground truth validation data for future simulation studies . 
Exponential decay in the Stk number with respect to the distance travelled by the spatter particles . 
In Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) , inert gas is pumped into the chamber to eliminate the deleterious by-products , which includes spatter . 
Despite this , traces of spatter on the powder bed have always been observed . 
Earlier research mainly focussed on the formation and characterization of spatter particles that were freshly ejected from the melt pool . 
However , in this study , the quantification of the spatter distribution on the powder bed was performed , following their transport by the inert gas flow which was varied at two gas pump settings ( 60 and 67 % ) . 
Image processing for spatter detection based on contrast was first conducted . 
The sieved out spatter particles were quantified by precision weighing of mass . 
Optical microscopy was then utilised for size determination . 
The majority of spatter particles were originally distributed along the −x direction , as observed from the top down images taken . 
However , increasing the gas flow velocity did not correspond to a lesser mass distribution . 
Computations on the Stk number revealed that at the gas pump setting of 67 % , spatter particles of greater size were deposited earlier on the powder bed , suggesting that increasing the gas flow velocity to a large extent would increase the likelihood of powder bed contamination . 
The forward extrapolation of the exponential Stk number trendlines also elucidated the reason for the limitations on the width of the powder bed in machines designed by SLM Solutions . 
Bulk high strength and thermally stable Al85Nd8Ni5Co2 samples have been prepared by selective laser melting ( SLM ) . 
The alloy shows a composite-like microstructure consisting of submicron-sized stable intermetallic phases dispersed in an Al matrix , which leads to high compressive strength ( 1–0.5 GPa ) at elevated temperatures ( 303–573 K ) . 
These results indicate that SLM is an effective alternative to conventional routes for producing dense , thermally stable and near net shaped components from high strength Al-based alloys . 
In this study , novel biomedical Co29Cr9W3Cu samples were fabricated using selective laser melting ( SLM ) technology . 
In order to better understand the formation of the lattice defects during the melting process , and the tensile deformation mechanism of the SLM-produced Co29Cr9W3Cu samples , the microstructures of the samples before and after tensile deformation were observed using a scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) , a transmission electron microscope ( TEM ) , and an electron back-scattered diffraction ( EBSD ) , respectively . 
The SEM morphology indicated that the non-equilibrium structure of the SLM-produced Co29Cr9W3Cu samples contained cellular and columnar subgrains . 
The TEM observation and EBSD analysis showed that the accumulated residual stress during the SLM process predominated in the overlapping regions between the adjacent scanning tracks , which consequently induced a larger number of the lattice defects , such as dislocations and overlapping stacking faults . 
The analysis of the tensile deformation revealed that the main plastic deformation was caused by the strain-induced martensitic transformation effect in the SLM-produced Co29Cr9W3Cu samples . 
Alumina/aluminum titanate composites were prepared using directed laser deposition . 
Scanning speed has a significant effect on the microstructure and macro features . 
Microstructure and macro defects are responsible for the trend of properties . 
Optimal forming quality was achieved at the medium-speed scanning process window . 
Directed energy deposition ( DED ) has developed rapidly in recent years as a new material-structure integration manufacturing technology for preparing melt-growth ceramics . 
However , the influence of process conditions on the forming quality has not been systematically studied . 
Alumina/aluminum titanate composite ceramics were directly prepared using DED technology with an extensive process window . 
The effects of the scanning speed on the typical defects , microstructure , and mechanical properties of prepared samples were systematically investigated , and the optimized process parameters were determined . 
Results show that the scanning speed has a significant effect on the macroscopic defects , such as cracks and pores , microstructure characteristics , such as grain morphology and size , and mechanical properties , such as flexural strength . 
Slow-speed scanning achieved a longer retention time of the liquid molten pool , which was beneficial to pore suppression . 
Rapid scanning reduced the temperature gradient at the bottom of the molten pool to obtain crack-free samples . 
The directional growth tendency of α-Al2O3 cellular dendrites that were discretely distributed in the Al6Ti2O13 matrix phase weakened , and the secondary dendrites gradually developed by increasing the scanning speed . 
This phenomenon was attributed to the change of the heat-dissipation direction and the solidification rate of solid/liquid interface caused by the scanning speed . 
Moreover , the fracture toughness of the prepared samples gradually increased as the scanning speed increased , while the flexural strength showed a parabolic law behavior . 
The trend of the properties was due to microstructure refinement and macroscopic defects . 
Generally , the optimal forming quality was achieved at a scanning speed of 300-500 mm/min . 
Within this process window , the sample had up to 98 % densification , 1640 Hv hardness , 3.75 MPa m1/2 fracture toughness , and 212 MPa flexural strength . 
In-situ uniaxial tensile tests coupled with X-ray computed tomography ( XCT ) were carried out on a Cu-4.3Sn alloy fabricated by selective laser melting . 
XCT models were constructed to enable step-by-step visualization of pore growth during deformation . 
Evolution of pores ( mean diameter , density , volume fraction and sphericity ) was quantified as a function of plastic strain . 
Results show that macroscopic instability begins once the largest internal pores reach the surface . 
Also , accelerated growth and coalescence of the largest 50 pores leads to rapid localization of strain followed by fracture . 
Pore growth was modeled using the Rice-Tracey ( RT ) and Huang models for different populations of pores and the parameters were optimized . 
The RT and Huang constants were found to depend on the initial mean pore diameter . 
With increasing industrial interest and significance of the selective laser melting the importance for profound process knowledge increases so that new materials can be qualified faster . 
Therefore a 3D numerical model for the selective laser melting process is presented that allows a detailed look into the process dynamics at comparably low calculation effort . 
It combines a finite difference method with a combined level set volume of fluid method for the simulation of the process and starts with a homogenized powder bed in its initial configuration . 
The model uses a comprehensive representation of various physical effects like dynamic laser power absorption , buoyancy effect , Marangoni effect , capillary effect , evaporation , recoil pressure and temperature dependent material properties . 
It is validated for different process parameters using cubic samples of stainless steel 316L and nickel-based superalloy IN738LC . 
The results show the significance of evaporation and its related recoil pressure for a feasible prediction of the melt pool dynamics . 
Furthermore a possible way to reduce the times and costs for material qualification by using the simulation model to predict possible process parameters and therefore to reduce the necessary experimental effort for material qualification to a minimum is shown . 
Selective laser melting is an increasingly attractive technology for the manufacture of complex and low volume/high value metal parts . 
However , the inevitable residual stresses that are generated can lead to defects or build failure . 
Due to the complexity of this process , efficient and accurate prediction of residual stress in large components remains challenging . 
For the development of predictive models of residual stress , knowledge on their generation is needed . 
This study investigates the geometrical effect of scan strategy on residual stress development . 
It was shown that the laser scan strategy becomes less important for scan vector length beyond 3 mm . 
Together , these findings , provide a route towards optimising scan strategies at the meso-scale , and additionally , developing a model abstraction for predicting residual stress based on scan vectors alone . 
Fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) , sometimes called material extrusion ( ME ) offers an alternative option to traditional polymer manufacturing techniques to allow the fabrication of objects without the need of a mold or template . 
However , these parts are limited in the degree to which the welding interface is eliminated post deposition , resulting in a decrease in the interlaminar fracture toughness relative to the bulk material . 
Here reptation theory under nonisothermal conditions is utilized to predict the development of healing over time , from the rheological and thermal properties of Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene ( ABS ) . 
ABS is rheologically complex and acts as a gel and as such considerations had to be made for the relaxation time of the matrix which is important in predicting the degree of interfacial healing . 
The nonsiothermal healing model developed is then successfully compared to experimental interlaminar fracture experiments at variable printing temperatures , allowing future optimization of the process to make stronger parts . 
Modeling of mechanical behavior for the material-jet printed polymers including composites . 
Validation of the material models was conducted . 
A desired strain field can be created by locally tuning the printed material distribution . 
The goal of this work is to validate the material models for parts created with a Material Jetting 3-dimensional printer through the comparison of Finite Element Analysis ( FEA ) simulations and physical tests . 
The strain maps generated by a video extensometer for multi-material samples are compared to the FEA results based on our material models . 
Two base materials ( ABS-like and rubber-like ) and their composites are co-printed in the graded tensile test samples . 
The simulations were conducted utilizing previously fitted material models , a two-parameter Mooney-Rivlin model for the elastic materials ( Tango Black+ , DM95 , and DM60 ) and a bilinear model for the rigid material ( Vero White+ ) . 
The results show that the simulation results based on our material models can predict the deformation behaviors of the multi-material samples during a uniaxial tensile test . 
Our simulation results are able to predict the maximum strain in the matrix material ( TB+ ) within 5 % error . 
Both global deformation pattern and local strain level confirm the validity of the simulated material models . 
Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) of a high strength low alloy steel HY100 is considered in the present investigation . 
The current work describes ( i ) optimization of SLM process parameters for producing fully dense parts in HY100 steel and ( ii ) the effects of post-processing heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties . 
Samples have been fabricated by SLM using different combinations of laser power , laser scan speed , and hatch spacing . 
Fully dense samples were achieved at an energy density of 65 J/mm3 . 
Microstructures of the as-built and heat treated samples were investigated using optical and scanning electron microscopes , X-ray diffraction , and electron backscattered diffraction techniques . 
The as-built parts are unsuitable for direct application due to untempered , hard and brittle martensite microstructure . 
The as-built parts were subjected to post-processing heat treatments ( “ direct temper ” and “ quench and temper ” ) . 
The direct tempered samples exhibited higher yield strength and ultimate strength than the quench and temper ones . 
Noticeable amounts of anisotropy with respect to the build orientation , especially in tensile elongation , were observed in the direct tempered samples due to in-homogenous microstructure . 
Quench and temper treatment of the parts resulted in recrystallized grains with uniform microstructure . 
The current investigation shows that quench and temper at 650 °C is an optimum post processing treatment for HY100 SLM parts as it manifests desired strength with good tensile elongation . 
Surface pore defects are always formed during directed energy deposition processes , which may stem from entrapped gas bubbles . 
Such defects have detrimental effects on the build quality and performance of safety-critical metal parts . 
Despite previous experimental and theoretical studies devoted to this subject , direct observations of the dynamic behavior of gas bubbles and elucidation of how they form surface pore defects have not yet been achieved . 
In this work , the relationships between surface pore defects and the bubbles originating on the melt pool surface were carefully studied using high-speed photography at up to 20,000 frames per second . 
The appearance of surface pores was a result of dynamic competition between bubble explosion and solidification of the surrounding melt , where the final location of the surface pores is determined by the melt convection and the boundary motion of the melt pool . 
In the case of single-track deposition , complex thermocapillary convection drives gas bubble diffusion , and pore defects cluster along the lateral edge . 
In the case of multi-track deposition , surface pore defects were more likely to occur on the last track due to the gravity-driven flow effect that is determined by the track path and overlap . 
Metal-filled polymers containing micro-powders of highly conductive metals can serve as a starting material to fabricate complex metal structures using economic filament extrusion-based 3D printing and molding methods . 
We report our measurements of the thermal conductivity of copper samples prepared using these methods before and after a thermal treatment process . 
Sintering the samples at 980 ℃ leads to an order of magnitude improvement in thermal conductivity when compared with as-printed or as-molded samples . 
Thermal conductivity values of approximately 30 W/mK are achieved using commercially available polymer-copper composite filaments with a copper volume fraction of 0.4 . 
Over-sintering the samples at 1080 ℃ further enhances the thermal conductivity by more than two folds , but it leads to uncontrolled shrinkage of the samples . 
The measured thermal conductivities show a modest decrease with increasing temperatures due to increased electron-phonon scattering rates . 
The experimental data agree well with the thermal conductivity models previously reported for sintered porous metal samples . 
The measured electrical conductivity , Young ’ s modulus and yield strength of the present sintered samples are also reported . 
The Electron Beam Melting ( EBM ) technology enables the manufacturing of new designs and sophisticated geometries . 
The process is particularly well suited for the fabrication of lattice structures . 
A standard methodology is presented in order to predict the mechanical response of lattice structures fabricated by EBM . 
The inner and outer structure of single struts produced by EBM was characterized using X-ray tomography . 
Struts with a 1 mm diameter and different orientations respect to the build direction were analyzed . 
The geometry discrepancies between the designed and the fabricated strut were highlighted . 
Two effects were identified : ( i ) The produced struts are generally thinner than the designed ones , ( ii ) Within the produced struts , loads are not transmitted by the entire geometry . 
The elastic response of the strut was assumed to be represented by a circular cylinder with an equivalent diameter . 
The first one is the diameter of an inscribed cylinder whereas the second one is the result of a numerical simulation based on the 3D image of the strut characterized by X-ray tomography . 
The methodology was then applied to an octet-truss lattice structure . 
The mechanical equivalent diameter obtained by numerical simulation on a 3D image of the strut allows to simulate the “ true ” properties of the lattice structure by taking into account the manufacturing constraints of the EBM process . 
We have investigated the spatial distribution of microstructures of a Co-Cr-Mo alloy rod fabricated by Electron Beam Melting ( EBM ) method along built height . 
The topside of the rod is rich in γ-fcc phase and consists of fine grains with high local distortion density . 
The bottom part has an ε-hcp single phase and consists of relatively coarser grains with low local distortion density . 
The mean grain size increases from 56 μm ( at the top of the rod ) to 159 μm ( at the bottom ) , and is accompanied by a decrease in the γ-fcc phase fraction . 
As a result , the hardness of the samples , as well as the area fraction of precipitates formed in the samples , increases gradually from top to bottom of the rod , while corrosion resistance is uniformly high throughout the rod almost independently of the location . 
The mechanism behind the formation of phase distribution is discussed in terms of thermodynamic phase stability and kinetics of phase transformation accompanying the thermal history during the post-solidification process . 
To increase the productivity of Laser Powder Bed Fusion ( LPBF ) , a hull-bulk strategy can be implemented . 
This approach consists in using a high layer thickness in the core of the part , hence reducing the build time , and a low layer thickness in the skin , to maintain a high accuracy and good surface finish . 
The present study investigated to what extent this strategy affected the surface roughness , relative density , microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4 V parts . 
Ti-6Al-4 V specimens were built using two distinct sets of process parameters , one optimized for a 90 μm-layer thickness in the bulk and the other for a 30 μm-layer thickness in the hull . 
In addition to surface roughness and relative density measurements , a thorough microstructure analysis was done using both optical microscopy and SEM . 
Additionally , EBSD measurements and numerical reconstruction of the parent β grains were performed to evaluate the mesostructure and texture evolution from hull to bulk . 
Microhardness measurements and tensile tests were done to assess the effect of the hull-bulk strategy on the mechanical properties . 
The present study demonstrated the possibility of using the hull-bulk strategy to build high-quality Ti-6Al-4 V parts , without impacting their tensile properties , hence increasing the productivity of the process by a geometry-dependent factor , typically ranging between 25 % and 100 % . 
In Laser powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) , metal powders , sensitive to humidity and oxygen , like AlSi10Mg or Ti-6Al-4 V are used as starting material . 
Titanium-based materials are influenced by oxygen and nitrogen due to the formation of oxides and nitrides , respectively . 
During this research , the oxygen concentration in the build chamber was controlled from 2 ppm to 1000 ppm using an external measurement device . 
Built Ti-6Al-4 V specimens were evaluated regarding their microstructure , hardness , tensile strength , notch toughness , chemical composition and porosity , demonstrating the importance of a stable atmospheric control . 
It could be shown that an increased oxygen concentration in the shielding gas atmosphere leads to an increase of the ultimate tensile strength by 30 MPa and an increased ( 188.3 ppm ) oxygen concentration in the bulk material . 
These results were compared to hot isostatic pressed ( HIPed ) samples to prevent the influence of porosity . 
In addition , the fatigue behavior was investigated , revealing increasingly resistant samples when oxygen levels in the atmosphere are lower . 
A concept of body heat flux has been developed to predict part distortion . 
Powder-liquid-solid material state transition was simulated via user subroutine . 
Large tensile residual stress occurs on the top layer of the part . 
Part distortion was predicted with reasonable accuracy . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) is a promising technology to manufacture functional ( end-use ) metal parts with complex geometry directly from CAD data . 
The process induced high tensile residual stress and part distortion due to the non-uniform heat input during a SLM process would detrimentally affect the part performance . 
However , it is extremely challenging to predict distortion of a practical SLMed part if each single track is taken into account by using the conventional modeling methods The complex multiphysics phenomenon such as fluid flow in the melt pool , phase transformation during cooling , and resulted anisotropic properties further complicate this issue . 
In this study , a temperature-thread multiscale modeling approach has been developed to effectively predict residual stress and part distortion of a twin cantilever . 
An equivalent body heat flux has been proposed from the microscale laser scan model and imported as the “ temperature-thread ” to the subsequent mesoscale layer hatch model . 
The hatched layer is then heated up by the equivalent body heat flux and used as a basic unit to build up the macroscale part in a layer by layer fashion . 
The thermal history and residual stress fields of the twin cantilever during the SLM process were simulated . 
The predicted cantilever distortion agrees with the measured data with a reasonable accuracy . 
Open cellular structures fabricated in Ti6Al4V using the electron beam melting ( EBM ) process have been proposed for tissue scaffolds and low stiffness implants that approximate the properties of bone . 
The properties of these structures , regardless of cell geometry , have often been determined through compressive testing , and very few of these studies have investigated the flexural properties . 
For certain types of implants that are designed to fill very large segmental defects in appendicular bones , such as those used in limb sparing , compression testing does not provide the necessary insight into the complex loading states typical of bending . 
In this study , EBM-fabricated Ti6Al4V prismatic bars , populated with rhombic dodecahedron unit cells of various sizes and relative densities , were subjected to four-point flexure tests . 
While the results generally follow the power scaling models of Gibson and Ashby , the use of these models as a design tool is limited by machine resolution , particularly when producing structures with small pore sizes required for bone ingrowth . 
The laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) process can produce parts with complex internal geometries that can not be easily manufactured using a material removal process . 
However , owing to the different heat transfer efficiencies of a laser melting process , the optimal process parameters are limited to a small range . 
This study used galvanometric scanner technology and a diffractive optical element ( DOE ) to build an experimental multi-spot LPBF system . 
An adjustable multi-spot method was used to modulate the temperature field on the powder bed and enhance the processing quality and throughput . 
The results from the synchronized three-spot method using different scanning strategies improved the layer surface roughness Ra by 3.2 μm . 
Moreover , the scanning time was decreased by 38.1 % of the single-spot method . 
It has been shown that quality of components built using selective laser sintering ( SLS ) are strongly affected by the thermal history of the building process . 
Temperature variations of a few degrees across the powder surface can alter the mechanical properties of components and render them unsuitable for their intended purpose . 
Therefore , to improve the quality of SLS components and ease their adoption into the marketplace , temperature fluctuation issues must be addressed . 
Some success has been demonstrated in the past at reducing temperature non-uniformity by improving the heater system that pre-heats the polymer powder prior to sintering with the laser . 
This paper will cover a complimentary approach of actively controlling laser fluence on the powder surface based on infrared temperature measurements . 
By controlling the amount of energy input by the laser , a high level of control over the final part temperature can be achieved and uniformity can be improved . 
This paper will cover development of the feed-forward control system and will present results showing that for constant cross-section specimens , a 45 % improvement in ultimate flexural strength standard deviation was achieved . 
In the selective laser sintering of polymers , the most widely used powders are based on polyamide 12 ( PA12 ) , which is a semi-crystalline polymer . 
Because the mechanical properties of the printed parts depend largely on the microstructure , knowledge on the crystalline architecture is important . 
We developed a numerical model based on the finite element method to solve the flow , temperature and crystallization kinetics of PA12 powder during sintering using two different geometries . 
Our results show that the temperature plays a crucial role in the crystallization kinetics and that simplified 0D calculations can be used to study the crystallization kinetics if the temperature behavior in time at a certain location is known . 
With our choice of initial and boundary conditions , we found primarily crystals of the α′-phase . 
A model for predicting the thermal response of Inconel® 718 during laser powder-bed fusion processing ( LPBF ) is developed . 
The approach includes the pre-placed powder layer in the analysis by initially assigning powder properties to the top layer of elements before restoring the solid properties as the heat source traverses the layer . 
Different linear heat inputs are examined by varying both laser power and scan speed . 
The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated by comparing the predicted temperatures to in situ experimental thermocouple data gathered during LPBF processing . 
The simulated temperatures accurately capture the measured peak temperatures ( within 11 % error ) and temperature trends . 
The effect of neglecting the pre-placed powder layer in the simulations is also investigated demonstrating that conduction into the powder material should be accounted for in LPBF analyses . 
The simulation neglecting the powder predicts temperatures more than 30 % higher than the simulation including the powder . 
Four stages were designed to evaluate the surface morphologies of Ti6Al4V SLM parts . 
The stages focused laser power , scanning speed , hatch spacing and rescanning effects . 
Processing parameters significantly influenced vertical and top surface properties . 
The microcracks were noticed at the interfaces of adhered particles and melt pool . 
Viscosity and cooling rate are the key factors to regulate the surface morphology . 
The surface morphology of a product plays a crucial role under mechanical loading and chemical environment . 
Surfaces of Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) products often contain high roughness , which varies in different planes as well . 
The authors have explored the surface characteristics of the SLM samples that are influenced by different combinations of laser processing parameters . 
The considered processing parameters were Energy Density ( ED ) and its technological parameters namely laser power , scanning speed and hatch spacing . 
Additionally , a comparison study has been executed by rescanning effects considering melting with low ED and , thereafter , rescanning by the best possible laser processing parameters . 
The results evidently showed that the surface morphologies differ significantly due to different laser processing parameters . 
Eventually , the thermal and physical behavior of materials , such as the viscosity of the melt pool , thermal and physical stability of the melt pool , solidification time , cooling time , shrinkage , capillary effect , surface tension , balling effect , and the amount of melting of a powder particle , influenced the surface properties of the samples , along with unpredictability . 
The results showed an interesting correlation between the processing parameters and the occurrence of microcracks on the vertical walls of the specimens caused by the partially melted adhered powder particles . 
Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS ) specimens fabricated by fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) were post treated by acetone , ethyl acetate and their mixed vapour . 
The effect of different chemical vapour , exposure time and building orientation on the surface roughness , tensile strength , dimension and weight stability of the ABS specimens were investigated before and after treatment . 
The results demonstrated that all chemical vapours were capable of improving the surface coarseness of ABS specimens . 
The tensile strength of specimens treated with the acetone or the mixed vapour decreased with increasing the exposure time . 
The weight of specimens after treatment increased with prolonging the exposure time due to the absorption of the chemical vapours . 
In this work , polyphenylene sulfide ( PPS ) was reinforced with a thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer ( TLCP ) to generate composite filaments for use in Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) . 
Because of non-overlapping processing temperatures , rheology enabled taking the advantage of the dual extrusion technology , which generated nearly continuously reinforced filaments that exhibited a tensile strength and modulus of 155.0 ± 24.2 MPa and 40.4 ± 7.5 GPa , respectively . 
On printing using these filaments , the maximum tensile strength and modulus obtained were 108.5 ± 19.4 MPa and 25.9 ± 1.1 GPa , respectively , higher than the properties reported on using short fiber composites . 
Moreover , the tensile strength was lower , and the tensile modulus was higher in comparison with the reported use of continuous fibers . 
Additionally , the tensile properties in the print direction were higher than those of compression molded samples . 
The nearly continuous reinforcement did not restrict the mobility of the printer , unlike the reported performance of the continuously reinforced carbon fiber thermoplastics in FFF . 
This work aims to investigate the influence of the orientation and microtexture of columnar grains on the fatigue crack growth of a Ti-6.5Al-2Zr-Mo-V titanium alloy fabricated by directed energy deposition . 
In this paper , the fatigue crack growth rate test in three sampling directions in a directed energy deposited Ti-6.5Al-2Zr-Mo-V titanium alloy using compact specimens was carried out . 
The crack length was measured visually , and the fatigue crack growth rate of the stable crack growth stage was obtained . 
During the test , the influence of the microstructure on the crack growth was directly observed . 
In addition , the complete crack front shape was indicated on the fracture surface by the marker load technique , and the crack growth behavior was obtained . 
An optical microscopy , a scanning electron microscopy and a laser confocal microscopy were used to observe and clarify the influence of the columnar grain boundary on the crack growth behavior and the interaction between the crack front and microstructure . 
The results show that the fatigue crack growth rate in the three sampling directions is different in the low ΔK region ; the columnar grain boundary has no significant effect on the fatigue crack growth behavior , but the columnar grain itself has an effect on the fatigue crack growth behavior , which is indicated by the irregularity of the crack front shape in different columnar grains . 
Microhardness testing and electron backscattered diffraction were used to explain the above phenomena based on static and orientation characteristics . 
It was found that the microtexture and orientation of the columnar grains are responsible for differences in the crack growth rates , and the orientation of the columnar grains also determines the extent of the difference . 
Multi-scale microstructure of a laser 3D-printed Ni-based superalloy was examined . 
Elements and precipitates heterogeneously distribute at the cellular scale . 
Cell boundaries are characterized as low angle grain boundaries . 
The heterogeneous microstructure of a laser 3D printed Ni-based superalloy was examined at multiple length scales . 
The crystal grains grow in epitaxy with the substrate under the large temperature gradient and high cooling rate . 
The cell boundaries , decorated with γ/γ′ eutectics , μ-phase precipitates and high density of dislocations , show enrichment of γ′ forming elements and low-angle misorientations . 
Dislocations trapped in the intra-cellular regions are characterized as statistically stored dislocations with no detectable contribution to lattice curvature , and are the results of the interaction between dislocations and γ′ precipitates . 
Unlike conventional powder metallurgy techniques , selective laser melting ( SLM ) is characterised by its fully melting process and very high heating and cooling rates and little has been known about the influence of powder surface state on the SLM process . 
In this study , the influence of low temperature powder drying on the surface chemistry of Al-12Si powder and its subsequent effect on SLM was investigated in detail by means of an in-depth X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy . 
An enhanced densification ( relative density ≥99 % ) was achieved in the dried Al-12Si powder compared to the as-received powder . 
This has been attributed to the modification of powder surface by removing a moisture skin during the drying process , which prevents the formation of deleterious oxide and hydroxide during SLM . 
This study provides important information for achieving high relative density in SLM fabricated metal components from a powder drying aspect . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) processed stainless steel usually exhibits an inhomogeneous microstructure in the as-built condition . 
The effect of powder chemical composition on the microstructural evolution of SLM processed 17-4 PH in the as-built condition was studied . 
A path to achieve a fully martensitic 17-4 PH component in the as-built condition by fine-tuning the alloy composition without any post-built heat treatments was demonstrated . 
The as-built 17-4 PH phase transformation from δ ferrite to austenite ( γ ) and subsequently to martensite ( α ’ ) was governed by the concentrations of ferrite and austenite stabilizing elements as represented by a chromium to nickel equivalent ( Creq/Nieq ) value . 
Electron backscatter diffraction ( EBSD ) analysis revealed that increase in the WRC-1992 equations based Creq/Nieq value to ≥ 2.65 resulted in coarse δ ferrite grains with a < 100 > preferential crystal orientation along the build direction . 
Epitaxial growth of semi-circular and columnar δ ferrite grains accompanied by a marginal volume fraction of retained austenite and transformed martensitic phases was observed . 
Retained austenite and transformed martensitic phases exhibited a fine grain structure preferentially along the coarse ferrite grain boundaries . 
EBSD phase composition analysis along with thermodynamic equilibrium modeling implies that a lower Creq/Nieq value promotes martensite formation resulting in a less retained δ ferrite in the as-built condition . 
The microstructure of as-deposited LAMed 300 M steel is different from that of forgings . 
Heat accumulation affects the as-deposited microstructure of LAMed 300 M steel . 
After heat treatment , the microstructure of LAMed 300 M steel is refined and uniform . 
After heat treatment , the impact toughness of LAMed 300 M steel significantly improved . 
The crack propagation mechanism of LAMed 300 M steel is revealed by EBSD . 
Direct manufacturing techniques , such as directed energy deposition ( DED ) , are able to produce complex components efficiently . 
In this study , microstructure evolution and impact toughness of DED 300M ultra-high strength steel are investigated . 
The results show that the microstructure of the as-deposited DED 300M ultra-high strength steel is mainly composed of martensite and some blocky bainite . 
The micro-segregation of elements is observed within the interdendritic area . 
After heat treatment , the microstructure becomes uniform and consists of martensite and lower bainite . 
The impact toughness of the as-deposited DED 300M ultra-high strength steel is 9 J/cm2 , while it is significantly increased to 25 J/cm2 after heat treatment . 
Furthermore , it is observed that the fracture mode of the as-deposited sample is quasi-cleavage fracture . 
During the process of propagation , the main cracks would go across the martensite packet and deflect in the another one , and secondary cracks also deflected in the high-angle grain boundaries . 
By contrast , the fracture mode of heat-treated DED 300 M steel is ductile fracture . 
CP-Ti was used to produce SLM RAIs for immediate implantation . 
Inclination angle affects Sa by determining the powders melted in stairs . 
Dental implant with a consistent Sa was produced with gradient parameters . 
Vivo experiment showed good osteogenesis with the SLM RAIs in experimental dogs . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) is a promising technology for use in “ immediate implantation ” to quickly fabricate customized dental implants . 
However , the implant surface produced using SLM has a high and inconsistent surface roughness , which greatly affects early cell behaviors and osseointegration . 
In this work , samples were produced with different border process parameters and inclination angles . 
The surface roughness and morphology of the side surfaces were measured and studied . 
The results indicate that a large offset value increases surface roughness due to an insufficient energy input , while a small offset increases surface roughness due to an intensified Marangoni convection . 
Different inclination angles affect surface roughness due to stair effects and the heat-affected zone . 
Based on the above results , a dental implant was fabricated using gradient processing . 
Compared with the implant fabricated with a single parameter process , the implant processed with gradient parameters had a low and consistent surface roughness . 
An energy balance that describes the transfer of energy is proposed for the laser-based directed energy deposition process . 
The partitioning of laser energy was experimentally measured and accurately validated using a special process calorimeter for Ti-6Al-4V and Inconel 625™ alloys . 
The total energy provided by the laser was partitioned as : the energy directly absorbed by the substrate , the energy absorbed by the powder stream and deposited onto the substrate , the energy reflected from the substrate surface , and the energy reflected or absorbed and lost from the powder stream . 
Titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V showed higher overall or bulk absorption than the Inconel 625™ alloy . 
Processing with powder resulted in lower laser energy absorption within the substrate than without powder , due to the “ shadowing ” effect of the powder stream within the beam and loss of energy representing unfused powder . 
During processing at a laser power of approximately 1 kW the total energy absorbed during the deposition process was found to be 42 % for the Ti-6Al-4V alloy and 37 % for the Inconel 625™ alloy . 
Under these conditions 14 % of the total energy was lost by the Ti-6Al-4V unfused powder ; whereas only 11 % was lost by the Inconel 625™ powder . 
Cold gas dynamic spray is a cold spray technique for obtaining solid-state surface coating . 
Several materials such as metal , metal alloys , composite materials , and polymer have been deposited successfully through cold spray onto a substrate material . 
A number of industrial applications for cold spray have been developed worldwide in the field of aerospace , energy , automobile , biotechnology , and military applications . 
In the current study , effects of various processing parameter such as impact velocity , substrate preheating temperature , a combination of different materials and coefficient of friction were used to describe the impact behaviour of ductile materials ( copper , Cu , and aluminium , Al ) after deposition to find a way of addressing high-strain-rate dynamic problems . 
The parameters were also used to verify the deposition process for the modelling of cold gas dynamic spray ( CGDS ) by the Lagrangian approach of finite element analysis . 
The results of the analysis ( simulation ) and that of the published experimental results in the literature correlated well . 
The understanding of the impact behaviour using different parameters was evident by the analysis of temperature and equivalent plastic strain ( PEEQ ) . 
It was discovered that the deposition process and deformation are largely affected by particle material as compared to the substrate . 
A lower restitution coefficient was obtained when different materials of varying properties were combined compared to the combination of the same material . 
Also , the parameters under investigation do not affect the CGDS process individually , as their effects are interrelated . 
A β titanium alloy , Ti-10V-2Fe-3Al , was selectively laser melted under a modulated pulsed laser mode with different processing conditions . 
The as-fabricated samples were examined using a range of characterization techniques and properties evaluated through tensile testing . 
It is shown that with a small powder layer thickness ( 30 μm ) , a low laser power and a short exposure time ( i.e. 
, low energy density ) led to development of fine β columnar grains and widespread cell structures whereas increased laser power and exposure time ( i.e. 
, high energy density ) resulted in pronounced grain growth , increased texture and significantly decreased cell structures . 
Increasing powder layer thickness effectively promoted the columnar-to-equiaxed grain transition ( CET ) , leading to a greatly reduced texture and a hybrid microstructure which consists of small and chunky equiaxed grains together with a small number of large columnar grains . 
Athermal ω precipitates were observed in all the as-fabricated samples . 
In the samples made with high energy densities , α laths which tend to constitute a grid-like structure were observed . 
The samples with the finest columnar grains show both high strengths and good ductility thanks to full plastic deformation through both slipping and twinning . 
The samples with the hybrid grain structure , however , exhibits a highly limited or no ductility due to intergranular fracturing . 
The α-containing samples which also have coarse grains all failed in a cleavage fracture mode and exhibited almost no ductility . 
Transmission electron microscopy study reveals that the α-demarcated grid structure tended to confine plastic deformation within the β matrix and suppress the macroscopic plastic deformation throughout the samples . 
3-D printing shows great potential in laboratories for making customized labware and reaction vessels . 
In addition , affordable fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) -based 3-D printing has successfully produced high-quality and affordable scientific equipment , focusing on tools without strict chemical compatibility limitations . 
As the additives and colorants used in 3-D printing filaments are proprietary , their compatibility with common chemicals is unknown , which has prevented their widespread use in laboratory chemical processing . 
The results provide data on materials unavailable in the literature and the chemical properties of 3-D printable plastics that were , are in line with literature . 
Overall , many 3-D printable plastics are compatible with concentrated solutions . 
Polypropylene emerged as a promising 3-D printable material for semiconductor processing due to its tolerance of strongly oxidizing acids , such as nitric and sulfuric acids . 
In addition , 3-D printed custom tools were demonstrated for a range of wet processing applications . 
The results show that 3-D printed plastics are potential materials for bespoke chemically resistant labware at less than 10 % of the cost of such purchased tools . 
However , further studies are required to ascertain if such materials are fully compatible with clean room processing . 
Large pulsed electron beam irradiation was proposed as the new post-treatment of the selective laser melting process . 
LPEB irradiation can remove the partially melted particles and fill the cracks and void on the SLM-MS . 
There is the significant reduction of the surface roughness and the bcc α-martensite phase on the SLM-MS . 
Corrosion testing revealed that there is a moderate improvement in corrosion resistance after LPEB irradiation . 
The present work aimed to decrease the surface roughness of maraging steel ( MS ) by selective laser melting ( SLM ) using large pulsed electron-beam ( LPEB ) irradiation as a post-treatment . 
The MS samples were fabricated using different combinations of laser power , scanning speed , hatch distance , and build angle . 
The morphological features , surface roughness , phase content , and corrosion resistance of the MS samples in their as-fabricated ( ASF ) state were compared after LPEB irradiation . 
The ASF SLM-MS samples exhibit the presence of partially melted particles that spread over the entire surface and many cracks in both the longitudinal and transverse directions . 
Post-treatment by LPEB irradiation removed the partially melted particles , while reflow of the molten mass filled the cracks and voids and facilitated the formation of a uniform surface with a bright metallic finish . 
Body-centered cubic α-martensite was the predominant phase for the ASF SLM-MS samples , along with a small fraction face-centered cubic γ-austenite phase . 
After LPEB irradiation , the martensite was reverted to the austenite phase . 
The corrosion resistance of the LPEB-irradiated samples was moderately better than that of the ASF SLM-MS samples . 
The uniform surface morphology , removal of partially melted particles , absence of pores and cracks , decrease in Sa , and moderate improvement in corrosion resistance suggests that LPEB irradiation can be used as a post-treatment for SLM-MS samples . 
The laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) process produces complex microstructures and specific defects . 
To build structural components with an acceptable mechanical integrity , optimization of the processing parameters is required . 
In addition , the evolution of defects under service conditions should be investigated . 
In this study , the nickel-based alloy 718 was studied in the as-built metallurgical state . 
Laser processing parameters such as the laser power , scanning speed , and hatch spacing were modified to evaluate their effects on the porosity , microstructure , and mechanical properties at high temperatures . 
The porosity and pore shape were evaluated using relative density measurements and image analysis . 
Moreover , the effects of the microstructure and defects on the tensile properties and damaging processes at 650 °C were investigated in air . 
The results revealed that the loading direction is critical to the mechanical integrity of the alloy , due to the specific orientation of the microstructural interfaces and defects . 
A tensile test was conducted in vacuum at 650 °C and 2.10−4 s−1 , and the results indicated that damage processes were not affected by oxidation when the experiments were carried out in air . 
Microrobotic prototypes for water cleaning are produced combining stereolithography 3D printing and wet metallization . 
Different metallic layers are deposited on 3D printed parts using both electroless and electrolytic deposition to impart required functionalities . 
In particular , by exploiting the flexibility and versatility of electrolytic codeposition , pollutants photodegradation and bacteria killing are for the first time combined on the same device by coating it with a composite nanocoating containing titania nanoparticles in a silver matrix . 
The microstructure of the microrobots thus obtained is fully characterized and they are successfully actuated by applying rotating magnetic fields . 
This paper presents the results of numerical simulations and experimental tests on AlSi10Mg samples , having thin cylindrical channels built in the horizontal direction , using selective laser melting technology . 
The thermal state of the samples with channels of varying diameters is investigated by employing a simplified part-scale transient model that takes into consideration the overmelting effects through the change of the materials properties related with phase transition effects in the melted area of the sample . 
Comparison of simulation results and computing tomography of experimental samples reveal that the final cross section geometry of thin channels can be predicted and evaluated by the proposed model . 
Namely , it is found that the unsupported down-skin area of the channels is processed with formation of protrusions due to presence of the low conductive powder bed under the melted metal layer . 
This powder area overheated during laser action and melted together with desirable solid region of the model . 
Overmelting effects lead to the total closing of the channels with diameter less than 200 μm , partial closing of the channels of diameters 0.2-1 mm , and distortion of the cross section of larger channels . 
Possible approaches of adjusting the geometry of a channel are studied , considering the teardrop and enlarged shapes of the cross sections , which could help obtain a predefined cylindrical shape of the channels . 
A quasi-2D model of Micro-Selective Laser Melting ( μ-SLM ) process using molecular dynamics is developed to investigate the localized melting and solidification of a randomly-distributed Aluminum nano-powder bed . 
One of the biggest challenges in modeling the μ-SLM process is the computational treatment of the formation and growth of crystal nuclei in the meltpool . 
The present work overcomes this challenge using molecular dynamics simulation because of its capability to explicitly model the nucleation and growth of grains inside the meltpool . 
The localized heating and rapid solidification of meltpool is simulated by the direct control of the temperature in the meltpool both spatially and temporally . 
The rapid solidification in the meltpool reveals the cooling rate dependent homogeneous nucleation of equiaxed grains at the center of the meltpool . 
Additionally , the epitaxial grain growth from the adjacent laser tracks , previous layers , and partially melted nano-powders into the solidifying meltpool is observed along the highest heat flow directions . 
The growth of the long columnar grains into the top layer is inhibited if the penetration depth during the remelting of a previous layer is less than the depth of the equiaxed grains . 
Long columnar grains that spread across three layers , equiaxed grains , nano-pores , twin boundaries , and stacking faults are observed in the final solidified nanostructure obtained after ten passes of the laser beam on three layers of Aluminum nano-powder particles . 
Hot isostatic pressing ( HIP ) of the final solidified nanostructure is employed to eliminate the nano-pores , which act as sources of crack initiation during tensile loading . 
This work examines the use of dual-material fused filament fabrication for 3D printing electronic components and circuits with conductive thermoplastic filaments . 
The resistivity of traces printed from conductive thermoplastic filaments made with carbon-black , graphene , and copper as conductive fillers was found to be 12 , 0.78 , and 0.014 Ω cm , respectively , enabling the creation of resistors with values spanning 3 orders of magnitude . 
The carbon black and graphene filaments were brittle and fractured easily , but the copper-based filament could be bent at least 500 times with little change in its resistance . 
Impedance measurements made on the thermoplastic filaments demonstrate that the copper-based filament had an impedance similar to a copper PCB trace at frequencies greater than 1 MHz . 
Dual material 3D printing was used to fabricate a variety of inductors and capacitors with properties that could be predictably tuned by modifying either the geometry of the components , or the materials used to fabricate the components . 
These resistors , capacitors , and inductors were combined to create a fully 3D printed high-pass filter with properties comparable to its conventional counterparts . 
The relatively low impedance of the copper-based filament enabled its use for 3D printing of a receiver coil for wireless power transfer . 
We also demonstrate the ability to embed and connect surface mounted components in 3D printed objects with a low-cost ( $ 1000 in parts ) , open source dual-material 3D printer . 
This work thus demonstrates the potential for FFF 3D printing to create complex , three-dimensional circuits composed of either embedded or fully-printed electronic components . 
The aim of the present study is to utilize fractographic methods employing scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) images to investigate the effects of build direction and orientation on the mechanical response and failure mechanism for Acrylonitrile–Butadiene–Styrene ( ABS ) specimens fabricated by fused deposited modeling ( FDM ) . 
The material characterized here is ABS-M30 manufactured by Stratasys , Inc. Measurements of tensile strength , elongation-at-break and tensile modulus measurements along with the failure surfaces were characterized on a range of specimens at different build direction and raster orientation : ±45° , 0° , 0/90° , and 90° . 
The analysis of mechanical testing of the tensile specimens until failure will contribute to advances in creating stronger and more robust structure for various applications . 
Parameters , such as build direction and raster orientation , can be interdependent and exhibit varying effects on the properties of the ABS specimens . 
The ABS-M30 specimens were found to exhibit anisotropy in the mechanical response when exposed to axial tensile loading . 
The stress-strain data was characterized by a monotonic increase with an abrupt failure signifying brittle fracture . 
In certain combinations of build direction and raster orientation tensile failure was preceded by slight softening . 
The tensile strength and modulus , and elongation-at-break were found to be highly dependent upon the raster orientation and build direction . 
The relationship between the mechanical properties and failure was established by fractographic analysis . 
The fractographic analysis offers insight and provides valuable experimental data for the purpose of building structures in orientations tailored to their exemplified strength . 
Other examples are shown where artifacts of the FDM fabrication process act to enhance tensile strength when configured properly with respect to the load . 
The study also presents a systematic scheme employing analogs to traditional fiber-reinforced polymer composites for the designation of build orientation and raster orientation parameters . 
The dissolution kinetics of Laves phase has been analyzed . 
The mechanical properties of Inconel 718 are closely related to the morphology and size of the Laves phase , which must be quantitatively controlled to change the effect of the Laves phase from deleterious to beneficial . 
In this study , post-heat treatment was used to regulate the morphology and size of the Laves phase in Inconel 718 fabricated using laser directed energy deposition , and the dissolution behavior of the Laves phase during solution heat treatment was investigated . 
The results indicated that the sharp corners and grooves of the Laves phase preferentially dissolved , causing the morphology of the Laves phase to change from a long-striped to granular shape during dissolution . 
The dissolution kinetics of the Laves phase were also investigated using the Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov and Singh–Flemings models . 
The initial stage of dissolution was controlled by both the long-range diffusion of Nb and the interfacial reaction . 
Directed Energy Deposition was used to process 316 L in different atmosphere modes . 
A slightly higher oxide content was detected in samples built using shielding gas . 
The mechanical properties in both conditions were extremely high . 
Samples built in controlled atmosphere had slightly higher yield strength . 
A correlation between tensile properties and oxide content is reported . 
Laser-Directed Energy Deposition was used to produce AISI 316L stainless steel samples . 
The effect of the protective atmosphere on the microstructure and mechanical performance of AISI 316L deposited parts was investigated by building samples using a simple nitrogen shielding gas or using a nitrogen-filled build chamber . 
The effect of the different processing conditions on the microstructure was evaluated by X-ray analysis , optical and scanning electron microscopy . 
Only slight differences in the cellular dendrites morphology of samples built under different protective atmosphere conditions were observed . 
However , the presence of oxides was monitored too : the oxides composition and area fraction were analysed and compared by image analyses , and it was demonstrated that the protective atmosphere mainly affects the oxides dimensions . 
The effect of the oxides and nitrogen pick-up on the mechanical performance of the samples was evaluated by tensile tests . 
The results revealed that the nitrogen-filled build chamber allowed the achievement of slightly higher tensile strength and elongation with respect to the other processing conditions as a consequence of the reduced size of the oxide inclusions . 
Currently , the laser powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) process can not offer a reproducible and predefined quality of the processed parts . 
Recent research on process monitoring focuses strongly on integrated optical measurement technology . 
Besides optical sensors , acoustic sensors also seem promising . 
Previous studies have shown the potential of analyzing structure-borne and air-borne acoustic emissions in laser welding . 
Only a few works evaluate the potential that lies in the L-PBF process.This work shows how the approach to structure-borne acoustic process monitoring can be elaborated by correlating acoustic signals to statistical values indicating part quality . 
Density measurements according to Archimedes ’ principle are used to label the layer-based acoustic data and to measure the quality . 
The data set is then treated as a classification problem while investigating the applicability of existing artificial neural network algorithms , such as the TensorFlow in the Python language , to match acoustic data with density measurements . 
Heat treatment of Scandium and Zirconium modified AlMg alloys processed by Selective Laser Melting leads to precipitation of coherent Al3Sc particles . 
The number density of coherent Al3Sc particles in heat treated condition reaches 5.2 × 1023 m−3 . 
Coherently precipitated Al3Sc particles are < 5 nm in diameter . 
Grain boundary particles stabilize the microstructure against grain growth during heat treatment . 
Sc- Zr-modified Al-Mg alloy , processed by selective laser melting , offers excellent properties in the as processed condition , due to the formation of a desirable microstructure . 
As in conventional processing , such alloys are age hardenable , thereby precipitating a high fraction of finely dispersed coherent Al3 ( Scx Zr1-x ) intermetallics , which serve for the improvement of the mechanical strength . 
Electron backscatter diffraction measurements and transmission electron microscopy were used to determine the effects of heat treatment and HIP on the microstructures of SLM processed specimens . 
In addition , the chemistry and number density of Al3Sc particles was analysed by atom probe tomography . 
The results show that the bi-modal grain size distribution observed in the as-processed condition can be maintained even after a heat treatment , due to a high density of intragranular Al3 ( ScxZr1-x ) precipitates , and various other particles pinning the grain boundaries . 
A HIP post-processing can lead to grain growth in certain coarser grained areas , probably due to a local imbalance between driving and dragging forces , hence higher defect density and fewer pinning precipitates . 
Applying a heat treatment results in an increase of the density of ≤5 nm sized intragranular Al3 ( Scx Zr1-x ) particles by a factor of 4–6 , reaching 3·1023 m−3 to 5·1023 m−3 . 
Shrinkage stress occur perpendicular to boundaries of primary columnar grains . 
This stress forms immobile dislocation networks that hinder dislocation movement . 
Recrystallization during annealing at ≥1373 K eliminates the dislocation network . 
Networks of connected deformation and annealing twins block dislocation movement . 
Dislocation walls were found near grain boundaries . 
To widen the applications of FeCoCrNi high-entropy alloys ( HEAs ) fabricated via selective laser melting , their mechanical properties must be improved , and annealing plays an important role in this regard . 
In this study , the microstructure , residual stress , and mechanical properties of the as-printed specimen and specimens annealed at 773–1573 K for 2 h were compared . 
As the annealing temperature increased , the specimen structure recrystallized from all columnar grains to equiaxial grains containing numerous annealing twins . 
The dislocation network , which formed during the solidification process under considerable shrinkage strain , decomposed into dislocations . 
The residual stress , yield strength , and hardness decreased , while the plasticity and impact toughness increased . 
During the deformation of as-printed and low-temperature-annealed specimens , the dislocation network remained unchanged and provided resistance to the dislocations moving within it , thus strengthening the specimen . 
The tensile strength remained largely unchanged owing to the reduction in the residual stress during low-temperature annealing , as well as the formation of the twinning network and dislocation wall under large deformation upon high-temperature annealing . 
Meanwhile , the ductility greatly increased , thus increasing the potential for industrial application of HEAs . 
First-time fabrication of FCC + BCC dual-phase high-entropy alloys ( DP-HEAs ) by SLM . 
New alloy design strategy for attaining strong , yet ductile DP-HEAs suitable for rapid solidification . 
Deformation nano-twins , stacking faults and strain-activated B2-to-FCC phase transition are discovered in BCC phase . 
The deformation mechanisms of the FCC and B2 phases are uncovered . 
Preparing dual-phase high-entropy alloys ( DP-HEAs ) by selective laser melting ( SLM ) has never been achieved owing to high crack susceptibility induced by rapid solidification . 
Here we design and fabricate new face-centered cubic ( FCC ) and body-centered cubic ( BCC ) DP-HEAs based on BCC AlCrCuFeNi HEA using SLM . 
Results show that the addition of Ni facilitates the columnar-to-near-equiaxed transition and improves the formability of the as-built AlCrCuFeNix ( 2.0 ≤ x ≤ 3.0 ) HEAs . 
Especially , the as-built AlCrCuFeNi3.0 HEA exhibits modulated nano-sized lamellar or cellular dual-phase structures and possesses the best combination of ultimate tensile strength ( ∼ 957 MPa ) and ductility ( ∼ 14.3 % ) . 
Post-deformation research reveals that the FCC phase is deformed through planar dislocation slip with { 111 } < 110 > slip systems , and stacking faults ( SFs ) . 
Strain-activated B2-to-FCC phase transition occurs in the B2 phase . 
The uncovered synergy of various deformation modes and the underlying back stress strengthening induced by heterogeneous microstructures contribute to the high ultimate tensile strength and good ductility of the as-built AlCrCuFeNi3.0 HEA . 
3D printing of flexible conductive nanocomposites were investigated .

Anisotropy in conductivity was observed up to an order of magnitude . 
Soft actuators with built-in touch sensors was successfully printed . 
Soft actuators with built-in piezoresistive sensing was demonstrated . 
With applications in flexible electronics and soft robotics , the ability to fabricate elastic functional materials with complex geometries has become highly desirable . 
In this work , flexible thermoplastic polyurethane/multiwalled carbon nanotube ( TPU-MWCNT ) composites were printed using multi-material fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) to study their feasibility towards built-in sensing capabilities in soft robotics . 
The microstructure , electrical conductivity , capacitive sensing , and piezoresistive sensing of the printed samples were investigated . 
MWCNT content , print orientation , and layer height was found to be the most influential parameters on the electrical properties while the nozzle and bed temperatures showed insignificant impacts . 
Overall , the in-line and through-line conductivities were one order of magnitude higher than the through-layer conductivity . 
A soft pneumatic actuator was then designed and printed out of TPU-MWCNT using the optimized process conditions . 
The built-in capacitive and piezoresistive sensing capabilities of the printed actuators were successfully demonstrated upon gripping contact and actuation at three different pressure levels . 
This work unveils the potential of integrating a variety of feedback sensors in robotic actuators through FFF process . 
In this study , commercially pure titanium ( CP-Ti ) parts were successfully fabricated by selective laser melting ( SLM ) using cost-effective hydride-dehydride ( HDH ) Ti powders for the first time modified by jet milling . 
Jet milling effectively improves the particle-shape sphericity , suppresses the impurity pick-up , and produces localized plastic deformation . 
The oxide layer in the powder surface is determined with the thickness of ∼8 nm and TiO being the predominant phase before and after jet milling . 
The SLM-made ( SLMed ) CP-Ti achieves dominant martensitic α ’ phase with the fracture tensile strength up to 731.5 ± 5.7 MPa and elongation of 20.5 ± 1.1 % , comparable with those using expensive atomized powders . 
Contrary to the conventional metallurgical mechanism for Ti which suffers the cost-performance dilemma , this work presents SLMed CP-Ti with excellent synergy of strength and ductility while using the cost-affordable HDH Ti powders . 
In this work the tensile behaviour of selective laser melted ( SLMed ) aluminium alloy A357 in the as-fabricated and heat-treated states is explained using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , electron backscatter diffraction ( EBSD ) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , and transmission electron backscatter diffraction ( t-EBSD ) . 
The as-built sample has an ultrafine microstructure , with high residual stresses and non-equilibrium solid solute concentration of Si in the supersaturated Al matrix . 
Consequently , the tensile properties of the SLMed Al alloy A357 are comparable or better than traditional cast counterparts . 
The Al grains in the SLMed alloy consist of sub-micron sized Al cells , and both high angle and low angle boundaries are initially occupied by eutectic nano-sized Si particles , which are beneficial for strength but detrimental for ductility . 
With subsequent solution heat treatment , the Si particles on the low angle cell boundaries ( LACBs ) dissolve while those at the high angle grain boundaries ( HAGBs ) coarsen . 
Simultaneously internal stresses decrease , as does solute content in the matrix . 
The evolution of these microstructural features explains the improved tensile ductility ( at its maximum > 23 % ) and reduced tensile strength for the heat treated SLMed aluminium alloy A357 samples . 
Correlations between microstructures and corrosion resistances of SLMed Inconel 718 alloy are studied . 
Platelet-shape δ phases are discovered after solution annealing treatment . 
Corrosion micro-batteries cause the formation of pits or cracks at secondary phase boundaries . 
Corrosion mechanism of SLMed Inconel 718 alloy is revealed . 
The microstructures and corrosion resistances of Inconel 718 alloy prepared by selective laser melting ( SLM ) , SLM following various heat treatments , and conventional rolling are studied . 
Results show that only Nb element is enriched in interdendritic regions while Fe element is abundant in dendritic trunks for the as-built Inconel 718 alloy . 
After solution annealing treatment , incomplete recrystallization is observed and distortion energy is released . 
Increasing the solution annealing temperature from 980 °C to 1020 °C ( ST1∼ST3 ) , the morphologies of δ phases turn from needle-like into short platelet shape , which reduces the anodic current density and improves the corrosion resistance compared to other heat-treated samples in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution . 
Corrosion morphology observation shows that obvious cracking of surface passive film occurs for the SLM , solution annealing plus double aging ( SA ) and rolled samples , while corrosion pits and micro-cracks appear at the δ phase boundaries of solution-annealed ( ST1∼ST3 ) samples . 
The surface passive film is smooth for the rolled sample . 
The corrosion resistance of samples obtained by different processes follows in the order of rolled > ST3 > ST2 > ST1 > SA > SLM . 
The high interface energy and lattice misfit may provide driving forces for the preferential dissolution of γ matrix rather than second phases . 
The inferior corrosion resistance of the as-built Inconel 718 alloy can be significantly improved through solution annealing treatment at 1020 °C . 
The increase of molecular weight of partcake powder could be traced back to a linear chain growth / post condensation reaction with GPC analysis . 
The influence of build time in selective laser sintering on molecular changes of polyamide 12 powder is more significant than the effect of build temperature . 
With increasing molecular weight , the chain mobility is reduced and the crystallization temperature shifts to lower temperatures . 
This broadens the processing window , but higher molecular weights go along with a higher viscosity , which is not favorable for SLS process . 
The material aging in selective laser sintering SLS of polyamide 12 is one challenge , which has to be overcome for implementation of this technique in serial production . 
High temperatures and along going processing times lead to chemical and physical aging effects of the supporting partcake material . 
The investigations in this study aims at the influence of processing time and temperature on molecular changes and thermal properties of polyamide 12 partcake material in selective laser sintering . 
The focus of the investigations lays on the global heat exposure of the of the bulk material und thus on global material changes . 
Gel permeation chromatography analysis was used to determine the molecular weight distribution and changes of polymer structure . 
With increasing build time and build chamber temperature the average molecular weight is rising , whereby the influence of build time is more significant . 
The rise of chain length leads to a reduction of crystallization temperature , which was detected by DSC . 
This work investigated the superelastic response of the low-modulus porous β type Ti-35Nb-2Ta-3Zr scaffolds with different pore dimensions fabricated by laser powder bed fusion . 
The superelastic behavior was enhanced with increasing the pore size and stress-induced phase transformation , which correspondingly led to stress-induced α '' [ 110 ] -type I twin martensitic transformation and ω formation adjacent to β matrix/twins . 
The resultant interstitial compound phase structure facilitated the β → α '' and β → ω transition , which was triggered by interfacial stress/strain concentration and high-density dislocations . 
Substantial high-angle grain boundaries ( HAGBs ) accumulated high-intensity Schimd factor and crystallographic texture after being deformed . 
Moreover , a lower Young ’ s modulus was obtained when the pore size and stress increased . 
A vision-based inspection system based on three digital cameras is proposed for measuring the cladding height in the Direct Energy Deposition ( DED ) process . 
To improve the accuracy of the cladding height measurements , an image processing technique is applied to remove the undesirable zone from the binary image . 
Furthermore , since the unit length in the captured images is different to that in the world coordinate framework , a calibration bar method is designed to transform the pixel value to the real size . 
An image-processing technique is then employed to isolate the laser nozzle and melt pool in the captured images . 
Finally , the cladding height is estimated based on the distance between the tip of the laser nozzle and the centroid of the melt pool . 
The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated by comparing the inspection results for the cladding height of a horseshoe component with the measurements obtained using a 3-D scanner . 
The maximum estimation error is found to be just 4.2 % Overall , the results confirm that the proposed trinocular vision-based system provides a rapid , convenient and accurate means of determining the cladding height in the DED process . 
The aim of this study is to promote the magnetic shielding characteristics of laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) processed NiFeMo alloy . 
This was achieved via controlling the crystallographic texture of the builds to increase the grain population along the easy axis of magnetisation , as well as the use of post-process hydrogen heat treatment ( HT ) and hot isostatic pressing ( HIP ) processes . 
The as-fabricated microstructure typically demonstrates weak magnetic properties due to the alignment of the crystallographic orientation/spin order along the [ 100 ] hard axis of magnetisation , which is parallel to the build direction since it is also the preferred growth direction during solidification in cubic materials . 
The improved ferromagnetism following HIP + HT was due to several combined effects , including stress relief , consolidation of gas pores , recrystallisation , and grain growth . 
The post-processing sequence ( HT + HIP vs. HIP + HT ) appeared to affect the resulting magnetic characteristics . 
Finally , the tensile properties for the builds were characterised to ensure that both functional and mechanical behaviours would achieve the required performance . 
Usually the process gas flow rates and the process gas types are not regarded as the primary process parameters of the laser cladding process . 
Herein it is shown , how the melt pool surface oxidation can be significantly reduced by the change of the carrier gas type , by a reduced carrier gas flow rate and by minor changes in the powder nozzle design . 
A simulation model for the gas flow and the powder particle flow between the powder nozzle and the melt pool surface has been developed , which reveals the volume percentage of different gas types and so the quality of the shield gas atmosphere . 
Additionally , the powder particle distribution and the attenuation of the laser beam by the powder particles can be simulated . 
The simulation results are confirmed by experimental measurements of the powder particle density distribution in the working plane , by measurements of the oxygen volume percentage at the workpiece surface , by high-speed camera images of the melt pool surface and by absorptivity measurements , which show the effect of oxidation on the process . 
TiB precipitates were significantly refined in the EB-PBF-built Ti-6242S-1.0B alloy compared with forged alloys . 
Finer oxides contributed to the formation of more compact oxidation layers in the EB-PBF-built alloy than as-forged alloy . 
Evaporation of B2O3 from coarse TiB particles destabilized the oxidation layer in the as-forged alloy . 
Evaporation of B2O3 from fine TiB particles did not destabilize the oxidation layer in the EB-PBF-built alloy . 
EB-PBF-built Ti-6242S-1.0B alloy was more resistant to oxidation than the as-forged alloy . 
Refined TiB precipitates significantly enhance the oxidation resistance of Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-2Mo-0.1Si-1.0B alloy fabricated by electron beam powder bed fusion ( EB-PBF ) . 
Refined TiB precipitates in the EB-PBF-built alloy enable finer oxide formation than the larger precipitates in the forged alloy , and the resulting oxidation layers are more compact . 
Evaporation of scattered B2O3 generated by the refined TiB precipitates in the EB-PBF-built alloy do not significantly accelerate detachment of the oxidation layer from the substrate . 
However , collective evaporation of B2O3 generated by larger TiB precipitates in the forged alloy accelerate detachment . 
The oxidation layer on the EB-PBF-fabricated alloy was more stable , preventing further oxidation and improving oxidation resistance . 
We report on the development of a miniaturized device for operando X-ray diffraction during laser 3D printing . 
We describe the design considerations , details on the setup and the implementation at two different beamlines of the Swiss Light Source . 
Its capabilities are demonstrated by ex situ printing of complex shapes and operando X-ray diffraction experiments using Ti-6Al-4V powder . 
It is shown that the beamline characteristics have an important influence on the X-ray footprints of the microstructural evolution during 3D printing . 
From the intensity of the diffraction peaks , the evolution of the different phases can be followed during printing . 
Furthermore , the diffuse scattering signal provides information on the precise location of the laser beam on the sample and the scanning head settling time . 
Some AM processes such as directed energy deposition ( DED ) have typical powder usage efficiencies ranging between 40 and 80 % . 
Since , for a given alloy , powder cost is proportional to its purity , choosing a less expensive powder or reusing powders is interesting for economical and environmental reasons . 
The work summarized below studied the effect of oxygen content in Ti6Al4V powders on mechanical properties of AM parts fabricated by DED . 
Three different powders with increasing oxygen content were used to produce specimens and characterize its effect on microstructure and tensile properties before and after heat treatment . 
Only coarsening of the particle size distribution and the presence of fragmented particles was observed for the recycled powder . 
Comparing the chemistry of parts vs that of powder feedstock it was determined that for all the tests , the Al content was slightly lower in the parts and that no significant loss of vanadium was noted when printing with new ( fresh ) powders . 
On the other hand , V loss was significant in parts made with recycled powders , although still leaving them within acceptable chemistry to respect their original grade 5 classification . 
The build quality of laser Powder Bed Fusion ( PBF ) components largely depends on printing issues such as inter-track voids and undesired microstructure . 
In this work , a comprehensive phenomenological model was developed to compute the complex transport phenomena during laser PBF of Ti-6Al-4V . 
The transient temperature and velocity fields during single-track and multi-track laser PBF were computed considering the melting and solidification of the powder feedstocks . 
Critical metallurgical variables including the molten pool characteristics and thermal cycles were obtained . 
The model was validated by comparing the computed results against corresponding experimental data . 
The formation and evolution of inter-track voids in different heat input conditions were studied . 
The first type appeared in irregular elongated shapes and was caused by the incomplete melting of the powder feedstocks . 
Cooling rates were obtained to interpret the metallurgical conditions for the solid-state phase transformations . 
The novel findings from this research are helpful to the understanding of the formation and mitigation of inter-track voids , and the assessment of phase transformations during laser PBF of titanium alloys . 
The fracture toughness ( K1c ) and fatigue crack growth rate ( FCGR ) properties of selective laser melted ( SLM ) specimens produced from grade 5 Ti6Al4V powder metal has been investigated . 
Three specimen orientations relative to the build direction as well as two different post-build heat treatments were considered . 
Specimens and test procedures were designed in accordance with ASTM E399 and ASTM E647 standard . 
The results show that there is a strong influence of post-build processing ( heat treated versus ‘ as built ’ ) as well as specimen orientation on the dynamic behaviour of SLM produced Ti6Al4V . 
The greatest improvement in properties after heat treatment was demonstrated when the fracture plane is perpendicular to the SLM build direction . 
This behaviour is attributed to the higher anticipated influence of tensile residual stress for this orientation . 
The transformation of the initial rapidly solidified microstructure during heat treatment has a smaller beneficial effect on improving mechanical properties . 
3D-printed PLA/Ti scaffolds with tailored porosity and pore size were fabricated via fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) . 
Thermal properties of PLA/Ti filaments were changed by the addition of Ti . 
5–10 vol % of Ti enhanced the mechanical properties of 3D-printed PLA/Ti scaffolds . 
In vitro assays showed good cell responses in PLA/Ti scaffolds . 
3D-printed PLA/Ti scaffolds have potential as bone substitutes for tissue engineering . 
Ideal bone substitutes should ensure good integration with bone tissue and are therefore required to exhibit good mechanical stability and biocompatibility . 
Consequently , the high elastic modulus ( similar to that of bone ) , thermoplasticity , and biocompatibility of poly ( lactic acid ) ( PLA ) make it well suited for the fabrication of such substitutes by fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) -based 3D printing . 
However , the demands of present-day applications require the mechanical and biological properties of PLA to be further improved . 
Herein , we fabricated PLA/Ti composite scaffolds by FFF-based 3D printing and used thermogravimetric analysis to confirm the homogenous dispersion of Ti particles in the PLA matrix at loadings of 5–20 vol % . 
Notably , the thermal stability of these composites and the crystallization temperature/crystallinity degree of PLA therein decreased with increasing Ti content , while the corresponding glass transition temperature and melting temperature concomitantly increased . 
The compressive and tensile strengths of PLA/Ti composites increased with Ti increasing loading until it reached 10 vol % and were within the range of real bone values , while the impact strengths of the above composites significantly exceeded that of pure PLA . 
The incorporation of Ti resulted in enhanced in vitro biocompatibility , promoting the initial attachment , proliferation , and differentiation of pre-osteoblast cells , which allowed us to conclude that the prepared PLA/Ti composite scaffolds with enhanced mechanical and biological properties are promising candidates for bone tissue engineering applications . 
Effect of laser conditions on selectively laser melted maraging steel was studied . 
Volumetric energy density could not always clarify the change in relative density . 
Deposited energy density could clarify the change in relative density . 
This study provides an important insight for selectively laser melted materials . 
In this study , the effects of laser power and scan speed on the relative density , melt pool depth , and Vickers hardness of selectively laser melted ( SLM ) maraging steel were systematically investigated . 
The change in these structural parameters and hardness could not always be clarified by the volumetric energy density , which is widely used in the SLM processes . 
The deposited energy density , wherein the thermal diffusion length is used as a heat-distributed depth , can express the change in these structural parameters and the hardness with one curve . 
To clarify the effect of the laser parameters , the deposited energy should be used instead of the volumetric energy density . 
Thus , this study provides a new insight on the selection of the laser condition for SLM-fabricated materials . 
This work presents a comprehensive study on the influence of three different processing technologies ( Selective Laser Melting , Hot Pressing and conventional casting ) on the microstructure , mechanical and wear behavior of an austenitic 316L Stainless Steel . 
A correlation between the processing technologies , the obtained microstructure and the mechanical and wear behavior was achieved . 
The results showed that the highest mechanical properties and tribological performance were obtained for 316L SS specimens produced by Selective Laser Melting , when compared to Hot Pressing and conventional casting . 
The high wear and mechanical performance of 316L Stainless Steel fabricated by Selective Laser Melting are mainly due to the finer microstructure , induced by the process . 
In this sense , Selective Laser Melting seems a promising method to fabricate customized 316L SS implants with improved mechanical and wear performance . 
This original work proposes to investigate the transposition of crystallography rules to cubic lattice architectured materials to generate new 3D porous structures . 
The application of symmetry operations provides a complete and convenient way to configure the lattice architecture with only two parameters . 
New lattice structures were created by slipping from the conventional Bravais lattice toward non-compact complex structures . 
The resulting stiffness of the porous materials was thoroughly evaluated for all the combinations of architecture parameters . 
This exhaustive study revealed attractive structures having high specific stiffness , up to twice as large as the usual octet-truss for a given relative density . 
It results in a relationship between effective Young modulus and relative density for any lattice structure . 
The collection of the elastic properties for all the cubic structures into 3D maps provides a convenient tool for lattice materials design , for research , and for mechanical engineering . 
The resulting mechanical properties are highly variable according to architecture , and can be easily tailored for specific applications using the simple yet powerful formalism developed in this work . 
A volumetric , mini extruder for pellets or granules of recycled plastic that can be used in a RepRap FDM 3D printer for rapid prototyping is discussed . 
The steer Auger portion is added to increase the pressure inside a helix stator container of n-lobes as a helical rotor is turned . 
A novel , alternative multi-layer Moineau-based pump −easier to build , implement and clean– is also introduced to extrude a quantity of viscous material in vertical direction . 
In laser powder bed fusion ( PBF-LB ) , material is continuously ejected from the melt pool , commonly called spatter , and is distributed throughout the build chamber . 
There is a lack of understanding of the nature of this spatter and the effect it may have on the integrity of the final part and the quality of any recycled powder . 
This work reports a detailed investigation of spatter metallurgy for Inconel 718 . 
It is seen that the spatter created during processing produces powder that is significantly different to the virgin material , with particles up to 6 times larger . 
Oxidation , predominantly in the form of spots or films of Al2O3 and TiO2 was observed on the surface of some of the spatter particles . 
It is established that this oxide formation occurs at the melt pool surface before ejection of the spatter from the melt pool , and also that this issue is generic to PBF-LB process and certain alloys . 
The characteristics of different types of spatter are identified and are linked to spatter generation mechanisms . 
The vaporisation of material during processing produces clusters of nano particles whose composition indicate a preferential vaporisation of Cr from the bulk . 
The results of this study highlight that oxidation and issues presented by spatter particles dissimilar from the virgin material are unavoidable and greater consideration is needed for the generation and effect of spatter on part and powder quality . 
The paper describes a new approach in controlling and tailoring residual stress profile of parts made by Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) . 
SLM parts are well known for the high tensile stresses in the as – built state in the surface or subsurface region . 
These stresses have a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties and especially on the fatigue life . 
Laser Shock Peening ( LSP ) as a surface treatment method was applied on SLM parts and residual stress measurements with the hole – drilling method were performed . 
Two different grades of stainless steel were used : a martensitic 15-5 precipitation hardenable PH1 and an austenitic 316L . 
Different LSP parameters were used , varying laser energy , shot overlap , laser spot size and treatments with and without an ablative medium . 
For both materials the as-built ( AB ) residual stress state was changed to a more beneficial compressive state . 
The value and the depth of the compressive stress was analyzed and showed a clear dependence on the LSP processing parameters . 
The use of LSP during the building phase of SLM as a “ 3D LSP ” method would possibly give the advantage of further increasing the depth and volume of compressive residual stresses , and selectively treating key areas of the part , thereby further increasing fatigue life . 
Template-free 3D printing of electronic devices has the potential to broaden electronics integration to include complex integrated form factors , but success requires precise , adaptive control over materials processing . 
The development of such manufacturing technologies requires exploration of new combinations of ink sets , printing techniques , and automation strategies . 
A closed-loop feedback system that links deposition parameters with characterization was necessary to maintain μm-precision deposition for over 20 h without human involvement . 
This closed-loop control scheme enabled 3D printing of both single- and double-layer high-voltage capacitors with capacitances as large as 314 pF ( at 1 kHz ) and breakdown voltages over 1000 V , which is significant step towards repeatable template-free , 3D printing of electronics for rapid prototyping of multifunctional devices . 
The precise control over low minimum feature dimension , high breakdown voltage , and long print duration enables the exploration of a broader range of printed electronics application than conventional 3D printing techniques . 
Three-dimensional ( 3D ) printing can be a promising tool in tissue engineering applications for generating tissue-specific 3D architecture . 
The 3D printing process , including computer-aided design ( CAD ) , can be combined with the finite element method ( FEM ) to design and fabricate 3D tissue architecture with designated mechanical properties . 
In this study , we generated four types of 3D CAD models to print tissue-engineered scaffolds with different inner geometries ( lattice , wavy , hexagonal , and shifted microstructures ) and analyzed them by FEM to predict their mechanical behaviors . 
For the validity of computational simulations by FEM , we measured the mechanical properties of the 3D printed scaffolds . 
Results showed that the theoretical compressive elastic moduli of the designed constructs were 23.3 , 56.5 , 67.5 , and 1.8 MPa , and the experimental compressive elastic moduli were 23.6 ± 0.6 , 45.1 ± 1.4 , 56.7 ± 1.7 , and 1.6 ± 0.2 MPa for lattice , wavy , hexagonal , and shifted microstructures , respectively , while maintaining the same construct dimension and porosity . 
In addition , van der Waals hyperelastic material model was successfully utilized to predict the nonlinear mechanical behavior of the printed scaffolds with different inner geometries . 
These findings indicated that the CAD-based FEM prediction could be used for designing tissue-specific constructs to mimic the mechanical properties of targeted tissues or organs . 
The optical penetration depth of the laser beam into the powder bed is taken into account in this model . 
The convective heat flux dominate the heat tranfer in the molten pool , and further decides the shape of molten pool . 
Heat accumulation can significantly change the size of the molten pool , but has little effect on the molten pool shape . 
A physical model coupled with heat transfer and fluid flow was developed to investigate the thermofluid field of molten pool and its effects on SLM process of Inconel 718 alloy , in which a heat source considering the porous properties of powder bed and its reflection to laser beam is used . 
The simulation results showed that surface tension caused by temperature gradient on the surface of molten pool drives to Marangoni convection , which makes fluid flow state mainly an outward convection during SLM process . 
Marangoni convection includes convective and conductive heat flux , both of them have effects of on molten pool shape , but the effect of convective heat flux is dominant because its magnitude is one order larger than that of conductive heat flux . 
The convective heat flux accelerates the flow rate of the molten metal , benefits to heat dissipation . 
The convective heat flux makes the molten pool wider , while the conductive heat flux makes comparably the molten pool deeper and wider . 
Furthermore , heat accumulation caused by multiple scanning increases convection and conduction heat flux resulting in the increase of the width and depth of the molten pool , but no change of dominant role of convective heat flux to the shape of the molten pool . 
A staircase Inconel 718 block was fabricated to investigate the effects of the thermal cycles on the microstructure evolution in the selective laser melting ( SLM ) part using optical scope ( OM ) , scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) , and electron backscatter diffraction ( EBSD ) . 
The laser beam scanning strategy was clearly shown in the part under OM , including laser scanning pattern and hatch spacing . 
The Y-plane ( side surface ) was characterized by elongated colonies of cellular dendrites with an average cell spacing of 0.511 ∼ 0.845 μm . 
In addition , Laves phase was observed in the inter-layers and inter-cellular regions . 
Under the continuing effects of the thermal cycles , the fraction of the Laves-phase showed a significant drop with their morphology changing from coarse and interconnected particles to discrete Laves phase . 
This is attributed to the reheating process as Laves phase can be dissolved at a proper heat treatment . 
In terms of the width of the cellular dendrites , the longer the thermal cycle period is , the coarser the elongated grains are . 
With the repeating thermal cycle period elongating , the maximum intensity of the texture , together with the fraction of larger grains and the high misorientation angles , increased . 
Moreover , the area fraction of the porosity was below 0.2 % , with no remarkable effects found from the thermal cycles and the build height . 
Simulations capable of predicting the complex thermal behavior which occurs in a selective laser melting ( SLM ) process would help design and manufacturing engineers build more optimum designs in a reliable manner . 
A multiscale feed forward adaptive refinement and de-refinement ( FFD-AMRD ) finite element framework has been developed in response to this need . 
Support structures fabricated during SLM to overcome residual stress induced part distortion are a key part of the process , and a representation of these support structures in a finite element framework must be considered . 
If support structures could be designed with minimal material usage while still maintaining an ability to withstand the residual stresses generated during the part fabrication , this would significantly impact industrial use of SLM . 
In this work , the effective thermal properties of support structures are represented using thermal homogenization . 
The effective thermal properties of the support structures have been found to be a function of their geometry , anisotropy and constituent independent thermal properties . 
The objective of this work is to derive effective thermal property functions which could be directly incorporated in the FFD-AMRD framework mentioned above to enhance computational speed . 
Polymer Laser Sintering ( LS ) is a well-known Additive Manufacturing process , capable of producing highly complex geometries with little or no cost penalty . 
However , the restricted range of materials currently available for this process has limited its applications . 
Whilst it is common to modify the properties of standard LS polymers with the inclusion of fillers e.g . 
nanoclays , achieving effective dispersions can be difficult . 
The work presented here investigates the use of plasma treatment as a method of enhancing dispersion with an expectation of improving consistency and surface quality of laser sintered nanocomposite parts . 
To enable the preparation of polyamide 12 nanocomposite powder for applications in LS , plasma surface modification using Low Pressure Air Plasma Treatment was carried out on two nanoclays : Cloisite 30B ( C30B ) and Nanomer I.34TCN ( I.34TCN ) . 
Plasma treatment strongly reduced the aggregation of the nanoclay ( C30B and I.34TCN ) particles , and powders displayed higher decomposition temperatures than those without plasma treatment . 
LS parts from neat polyamide 12 , untreated I.34TCN and plasma treated I.34TCN composites were successfully produced with different complex shapes . 
The presence of well dispersed plasma treated nanoclays was observed and found to be essential for an improved surface quality of LS fabricated which was achieved only for plasma treated I.34TCN . 
Likewise , some mechanical properties could be improved above that of PA12 by incorporation of treated I.34TCN . 
For example , the elastic modulus of plasma treated composites was higher than that of polyamide 12 and the untreated composite . 
In the case of the ultimate strain , the plasma treated composite performed better than untreated and results had a reduced variation between samples . 
This illustrates the feasibility of the use of plasma treatments on nanoclays to improve the properties of LS parts , even though further studies will be required to exploit the full potential . 
Accuracy in dental prosthesis plays a significant role . 
Surgical guides are widely used for accurate positioning of dental implants . 
Designing of guides using modern software is useful in achieving precision ; however , translation of these images into actual fabricated parts can be achieved using Three-dimensional ( 3-D ) printing . 
Conventionally , guides were fabricated using vacuum forming technique which leads to several dimensional inaccuracies . 
Computed Tomography ( CT ) images of patients with missing teeth are modeled to design surgical guide using Computer Aided Design ( CAD ) / Computer Aided Manufacturing ( CAM ) software which is then combined with surface scan files in Standard Tessellation Language ( STL ) formats to design the guide . 
In this work , surgical guides have been 3-D printed using different technologies like Material Jetting technology ( MJT ) , Vat photopolymerization ( VP ) and Material extrusion ( ME ) . 
Depth , diameter , Area and Volume of the printed guides have been calculated using vernier caliper and scan measurements . 
These dimensions have then been compared with the dimensions obtained from software modeled images . 
Least error has been found for the guides fabricated using MJT . 
The experimental work in this paper , hence , suggests MJT be the most preferred printing technique due to its superior accuracy for printing dental prosthesis like aligners , implants , and crowns , etc . 
Four distinct TPU grades are analyzed for the use in laser sintering . 
Clear links between material properties and sintering behavior are established . 
Guidelines for future selection of TPU grades for laser sintering are deduced . 
As laser sintering is increasingly being used for the production of actual end-use parts , there is considerable interest in developing materials that would enable new applications for this technique . 
Considering their properties and current applications , elastomeric polymers such as thermoplastic polyurethanes ( TPU ) have a very high potential in this regard . 
This study investigates the material properties that are involved in TPU sintering through the analysis of four distinct TPU grades . 
Examined parameters include powder flow , rheology of the melt and shrinkage and hardening behavior . 
It is found that , even though the particle morphology is not optimum , smooth and dense powder layers can be deposited for the investigated powders . 
Low melt viscosity and low shrinkage upon hardening further enable these materials to be easily processed into functional parts . 
Remaining issues , however , are part porosity and material degradation . 
The findings in this study provide clear links between material properties and behavior during laser sintering , and result in guidelines for future selection of TPU grades . 
Support structures are critical to the successful printing of the overhang structures in selective laser melting . 
The heat transfer performance of support structures has significant influence on the temperature distribution and cooling rate within the overhang structures which in turn determine the microstructure and residual stress . 
In the present study , functionally graded support structures have been proposed and their thermal performance has been numerically investigated , with the consideration of different materials , cooling times and gradedness values . 
It has been found that functionally graded support structures can maintain a higher temperature level than the conventional uniform support structure at the bottom of overhang , which is equivalent to an extra pre-heating effect . 
The temperature fluctuation and cooling rate at the bottom of overhang can also be reduced by adopting the functionally graded support structures . 
Topology-optimized structure has ultrahigh normalized fatigue life of 0.65 at 106 cycles and low density . 
Topology-optimized structure increases fatigue life by reducing stress concentration . 
Twinning formed in porous CP-Ti samples enhances plasticity and fatigue properties . 
The fatigue properties are critical considerations for porous structures , and most of the existing porous materials have unsatisfactory performances due to a lack of structural optimization . 
This work shows that a topology-optimized structure fabricated by selective laser melting using commercial-purity titanium ( CP-Ti ) exhibits excellent fatigue properties with an ultra-high normalized fatigue life of ∼0.65 at 106 cycles and at a low density of 1.3 g/cm3 . 
The main factors affecting fatigue , i.e. 
, material properties and a porous structure were studied . 
Both the factors can affect the fatigue crack initiation time , thereby affecting the fatigue life . 
Because of twinning that occurred during the fatigue process , the porous CP-Ti samples exhibit a high plasticity . 
In addition , the fatigue crack propagation rate is significantly reduced because of the high plasticity of the CP-Ti material and the occurrence of fatigue crack deflection . 
Microstructure evolution in the molten pool of SLM-processed parts was disclosed . 
Variation of microhardness with local zone within the molten pool were measured . 
Thermal behavior within the molten pool was quantitatively analyzed . 
Relationship among microstructure , properties and thermal behavior was discussed . 
This work presented a comprehensive study of microstructural evolution , microhardness and quantitative thermodynamic analysis within the molten pool during Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) of Inconel 718 parts . 
Microstructures and corresponding microhardness of different zones within the molten pool experienced the following evolution : fine cellular dendrites or equiaxed grains on the top surface ( 387HV ) ; columnar dendrites with single direction of grain growth at the bottom ( 337HV ) ; columnar dendrites with multiple directions of grain growth at the edge of the molten pool ( 340HV-350HV ) ; microstructures between cellular and columnar grains around the center of the molten pool ( 363HV ) . 
The impact of Gaussian-distributed laser energy and relatively weak thermal conductivity and convection of Inconel 718 contributed to the variation of temperature gradient at different zones within the molten pool . 
The formation of different kinds of microstructures in the molten pool was controlled by the temperature gradient ( which determined the direction of grain growth ) and the cooling rate ( which determined the size of grain growth ) . 
The variation of microhardness within the molten pool was ascribed to the number of grain boundaries and the stress characteristics of different kinds of microstructures under mechanical load . 
The zones with fine cellular grains had elevated mechanical performance due to the superior capability to endure the load . 
This work hopefully provides scientific and theoretical support for SLM-processed Inconel 718 parts with favorable properties . 
With a view to developing a highly biocompatible and highly reliable material for artificial hip joints , cellular lattice structures with high strength and low Young ’ s modulus ( E ) were designed using computational shape optimization . 
These structures were fabricated from a biomedical Co-Cr-Mo alloy via electron beam melting . 
As a starting point for shape optimization , inverse body-centered-cubic ( iBCC ) -based structures with different porosities and aspects were fabricated . 
The strength tended to increase with increasing E. Then , the structures were re-designed using shape optimization based on the traction method , targeting a simultaneous increase in yield strength with retention of the low E. The shapes were optimized through minimization of the maximum local von Mises stress and control of E to 3/2 or 2/3 of the original value , while maintaining constant porosity . 
The re-designed cellular structures were fabricated and subjected to mechanical testing . 
The E values of the porous structures were comparable to the design values , but the strength of the cellular lattice with E = 2/3 ( design value ) was lower than expected . 
This discrepancy was attributed to inhomogeneities in the microstructures and their impact on the lattice mechanical properties . 
Thus , shape optimization considering crystal orientation is a significant challenge for future research , but this approach has considerable potential . 
A 3D finite element modelling of the SLM process at the track scale is considered . 
Heat transfer and fluid flow are simulated for different material and process conditions . 
Scan speed , laser interaction and Marangoni effect have a clear impact on track shape . 
The present study is based on a formerly developed 3D finite element modelling of the selective laser melting process ( SLM ) at the track scale . 
This numerical model is used to assess the impact of two phenomena on the shape of the elementary track resulting from SLM processing : laser interaction on one hand , and Marangoni effect on the other hand . 
As regards laser interaction , it is modelled by a Beer-Lambert type heat source , in which lateral scattering and material absorption are considered through two characteristic parameters . 
The impact of these parameters is shown in terms of width and depth of melted zone . 
The Marangoni effect caused by tangential gradients of surface tension is modelled to simulate the fluid dynamics in the melt pool . 
The resulting convection flow is demonstrated with surface tension values either increasing or decreasing with temperature . 
The influence of energy distribution , surface tension effects , as well as laser scanning speed on temperature distribution and melt pool geometry is investigated . 
The stability and regularity of the solidified track are a direct output of the simulations , and their variations with material and process conditions are discussed . 
A three-dimensional finite element model is developed to allow for the prediction of temperature , residual stress , and distortion in multi-layer Laser Powder-Bed Fusion builds . 
Undesirable residual stress and distortion caused by thermal gradients are a common source of failure in AM builds . 
A non-linear thermoelastoplastic model is combined with an element coarsening strategy in order to simulate the thermal and mechanical response of a significant volume of deposited material ( 38 layers and 91 mm3 ) . 
It is found that newly deposited layers experience the greatest amount of tensile stress , while layers beneath are forced into compressive stress . 
The residual stress evolution drives the mechanical response of the workpiece . 
The model is validated by comparing the predicted in situ and post process distortion to experimental measurements taken on the same geometry . 
The model accurately predicts the distortion of the workpiece ( 5 % error ) . 
This paper presents the first report on the development of weak-textured microstructures and resulting reduced in-plane anisotropy of mechanical properties in commercially pure titanium ( CP-Ti ) fabricated by electron beam melting ( EBM ) . 
The as-built specimens exhibited fine grain structures with weakened crystallographic textures . 
The β → α′ martensitic transformation after solidification was responsible for the weak textures as well as the relatively high strength . 
The results suggest that it is possible to use EBM to produce isotropic CP-Ti components , which can not be obtained by conventional processes . 
In laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) the surface layer temperature is continually changing throughout the build process . 
Variations in part geometry , scanned cross-section and number of parts all influence the thermal field within a build . 
Process parameters do not take these variations into account and this can result in increased porosity and differences in local microstructure and mechanical properties , undermining confidence in the structural integrity of a part . 
In this paper a wide-field in situ infra-red imaging system is developed and calibrated to enable measurement of both solid and powder surface temperatures across the full powder bed . 
The influence of inter-layer cooling time is investigated using a build scenario with cylindrical components of differing heights . 
In situ surface temperature data are acquired throughout the build process and are compared to results from porosity , microstructure and mechanical property investigations . 
Changes in surface temperature of up to 200 °C are attributed to variation in inter-layer cooling time and this is found to correlate with density and grain structure changes in the part . 
This work shows that these changes are significant and must be accounted for to improve the consistency and structural integrity of LPBF components . 
A three-dimensional model was developed for studying thermal behavior during selective laser melting ( SLM ) of commercially pure titanium ( CP Ti ) powder . 
The effects of scan speed and laser power on SLM thermal behavior were investigated . 
The results showed that the average temperature of the powder bed gradually increased during the SLM process , caused by a heat accumulation effect . 
The maximum molten pool temperature ( 2248 °C ) and liquid lifetime ( 1.47 ms ) were obtained for a successful SLM process for a laser power of 150 W and a laser scan speed of 100 mm/s . 
The temperature gradient in the molten pool increased slightly ( from 1.03 × 104 to 1.07 × 104 °C/mm in the direction perpendicular to the scanning path ; from 1.21 × 104 to 1.28 × 104 °C/mm in the thickness direction ) when the scan speed was increased from 50 to 200 mm/s , but increased significantly ( from 1.29 × 104 to 8.24 × 104 °C/mm in the direction perpendicular to the scanning path ; from 1.53 × 104 to 9.84 × 104 °C/mm in the thickness direction ) when the laser power was increased from 100 to 200 W. The width and depth of the molten pool decreased ( width from 137.1 to 93.8 μm , depth from 64.2 to 38.5 μm ) when the scan speed was increased from 50 to 200 mm/s , but increased ( width from 71.2 to 141.4 μm , depth from 32.7 to 67.3 μm ) when the laser power was increased from 100 to 200 W. Experimental SLM of CP Ti powder was carried out under different laser processing conditions and the microstructure of SLM-produced parts was investigated to demonstrate the reliability of the physical model and simulation results . 
Rational design of experiment is employed to optimize the contour parameters to improve surface finish of inclined surfaces . 
A significant variance in surface roughness is found among samples made at opposite corners on the build platform . 
The recoating process sorts powder by size , smaller particles settle within a short distance from start position of recoater . 
Large particles ejected from melt pool can not be completely removed by inert gas flow and affect subsequent SLM process . 
At a given position , inclined surface build up and away from the centre of the build platform has higher surface roughness . 
A rational design of experiments was employed to evaluate the correlation between scan parameters and the resulting surface roughness of Selective Laser Melted Ti-6Al-4V components . 
There is a statistically significant difference in surface roughness values from specimens built with identical laser exposure parameters but located at different positions on the build platform . 
We hypothesise that this is a consequence of changing powder particle size distributions across the powder bed resulting from the combined actions of the recoater arm and gas flow . 
We further hypothesise that orientation of a part and the projected shape of the incident laser beam play a part in surface roughness variation at any given location . 
We found that during the powder re-coating process , fine particles tend to settle within a short distance from the re-coater starting position , accompanied by higher variability of local powder size distribution . 
Spatter material was found to be distributed across the powder bed by the gas flow . 
However , once at any given location the surface roughness of inclined surfaces is affected by the orientation of the surface to the centre of the build platform at which the laser beam originates . 
Each of these factors affects the surface roughness and has implications for the order in which parts are built in Selective Laser Melting . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) is one of the most commonly used metallic component 3D printing techniques . 
In a previous investigation of multiple materials SLM reported by The University of Manchester , high porosities and cracks were found in the regions where the powder was deposited via an ultrasonic powder dispenser . 
The low powder packing density was identified as a critical reason for this . 
In this paper , we report a new method to compress the ultrasonically deposited powder layer in order to increase the powder packing density . 
The effects of powder deposition velocity , powder track overlap distance and powder compression force on the deposited powder characteristics were investigated . 
The microstructure , tensile strengths , and porosity of the laser-fused samples were analyzed . 
The results indicated that powder compression could reduce porosity and component distortion and increase the mechanical strength of the printed parts . 
Heterogeneous materials used in biomedical , structural and electronics applications contain a high fraction of solids ( > 60 vol. 
% ) and exhibit extremely high viscosities ( μ > 1000 Pa s ) , which hinders their 3D printing using existing technologies . 
This study shows that inducing high-amplitude ultrasonic vibrations within a nozzle imparts sufficient inertial forces to these materials to drastically reduce effective wall friction and flow stresses , enabling their 3D printing with moderate back pressures ( < 1 MPa ) at high rates and with precise flow control . 
This effect is utilized to demonstrate the printing of a commercial polymer clay , an aluminum-polymer composite and a stiffened fondant with viscosities up to 14,000 Pa·s with minimal residual porosity at rates comparable to thermoplastic extrusion . 
This new method can significantly extend the type of materials that can be printed to produce functional parts without relying on special shear/thermal thinning formulations or solvents to lower viscosity of the plasticizing component . 
The high yield strength of the printed material also allows freeform 3D fabrication with minimal need for supports . 
A self-healing and recyclable polyurethane based on dynamic halogenated bisphenol carbamate bonds was developed . 
The dynamic crosslinked polyurethane powders was developed for selective laser sintering for the first time . 
The introduction of dynamic bonds enhances interface interaction and Z-direction mechanical strength of printed products . 
Selective laser sintering ( SLS ) is one of the mainstream 3D printing technologies . 
A major challenge for SLS technology is the lack of novel polymer powder materials with improved Z-direction strength . 
Herein , a dynamic polymer was utilized to solve the challenge of SLS . 
The obtained dynamic polyurethane exhibited excellent mechanical strength and self-healing efficiency , in addition to SLS processing ability . 
A small molecule model study confirmed the dynamic reversible characteristics of the chlorinated bisphenol carbamate , which dissociates into isocyanate and hydroxyl at 120 °C and reforms at 80 °C , as confirmed by NMR and FT-IR . 
SLS 3D printing using the self-made healable PBP-PU powders was successfully realized . 
The interface interaction between the adjacent SLS layers can be significantly improved via dynamic chemical bond linking instead of traditional physical entanglement , which leads to an improved Z-direction mechanical strength . 
The SLS processed PBP-PU sample exhibits an X-axis tensile strengths of ∼23 MPa and an elongation at break of ∼600 % . 
The Z-axis tensile strength is ∼88 % of X-axis ’ s , much higher than that of control TPU sample ( ∼56 % ) . 
High porosity and interconnected pore size are crucial factors for bone scaffolds . 
However , since porosity is inversely related to strength , the microstructure must be optimized to achieve bone scaffolds suitable for load-bearing applications . 
The powder bed 3D printing method can fabricate the highly porous parts possessing the desired properties using micron-sized ceramic powders ( > 30 μm ) and polymeric ink , however , low sinterability and , consequently , low strength is still a problem . 
In this study , nano-scale powders are granulated and printed by a special 3D printing method called ‘ solvent jetting on granulated feedstock containing binder ’ to achieve an interconnected macropore structure with high strength . 
The advantages of this method , aside from the above mentioned , include obtaining controllable porosity , high strut density , wide neck formation , and small grain size ; all of which are beneficial to mechanical strength . 
Using this method , a purely ceramic sample with 30 % porosity and compressive strength of 113.1 MPa was obtained . 
Furthermore , a bone scaffold prototype with total porosity of nearly 50 % and mechanical strength of 30.2 MPa was fabricated . 
These procedures and results are described and compared to another solvent jetting method which uses micron-sized powders . 
The use of porous cellular structures in bone tissue engineering can provide mechanical and biological environments closer to the host bone . 
However , poor internal architectural designs may lead to catastrophic failure . 
In this work , 192 open-porous cellular structures were fabricated using 3D printing ( 3DP ) techniques . 
It was found that the pillar octahedral shape has not only greater stiffness and strength under compression , shear and torsion but increased rate of pre-osteoblastic cell proliferation . 
We believe bone implants can be fabricated using 3DP techniques and their mechanical and biological performance can be tailored by modifying the internal architectures . 
Vat photopolymerization is used for printing very precise and accurate parts from photopolymer resins . 
Conventional 3D-printers based on vat photopolymerization are curing resins with low viscosity at or slightly above room temperature . 
The newly developed Hot Lithography provides vat photopolymerization where the resin is heated and cured at elevated temperatures . 
This study presents the influence of printing temperature ( 23 °C and 70 °C ) on the properties of a printed dimethacrylate resin . 
Specimens were printed in XYZ and ZXY orientation . 
The resulting tensile properties were tested , dynamic mechanical analysis was carried out and the double-bond conversion was analyzed . 
Therefore , the exposure time was reduced from 50 s to 30 s to reach similar curing depth . 
Higher printing temperature provided higher double-bond conversion , tensile strength and modulus of the green parts . 
However , printing temperature did not affect the properties after post-curing in XYZ orientation . 
Post-cured tensile specimens in ZXY orientation had higher tensile strength when printed at 23 °C , because higher over-polymerization led to a smoother surface of the specimens . 
Overall , higher printing temperatures lowered the viscosity of the resin , reduced the printing time and provided better mechanical properties of green parts while post-cured properties were mostly not affected . 
In laser powder bed fusion , melt pool dynamics and stability are driven by the temperature field in the melt pool . 
If the temperature field is unfavourable defects are likely to form . 
The localised and rapid heating and cooling in the process presents a challenge for the experimental methods used to measure temperature . 
As a result , understanding of these process fundamentals is limited . 
In this paper a method is developed that uses coaxial imaging with high-speed cameras to give both the spatial and temporal resolution necessary to resolve the surface temperature of the melt pool . 
A two wavelength imaging setup is used to account for changes in emissivity . 
Temperature fields are captured at 100 kHz with a resolution of 20 μm during the processing of a simple Ti6Al4V component . 
Thermal gradients in the range 5–20 K/μm and cooling rates in range 1–40 K/μs are measured . 
The results presented give new insight into the effect of parameters , geometry and scan path on the melt pool temperature and cooling rates . 
The method developed here provides a new tool to assist in optimising scan strategies and parameters , identifying the causes of defect prone locations and controlling cooling rates for local microstructure development . 
In laser directed energy deposition ( L-DED ) processes , by applying a converged powder stream , relatively high laser power and larger laser spot , the powder utilisation efficiency and processing speed can be increased . 
In this paper , a three-dimensional numerical model is established to study the mass transport and heat transfer in the melt pools in high deposition rate ( HDR ) L-DED of 316L stainless steel . 
The Volume of Fluid ( VOF ) method is employed to track the melt pool free surfaces , and enthalpy-porosity method is used to model the solid-liquid phase change . 
A discrete powder source model is developed by considering the non-uniform powder feed rate distribution . 
Different from conventional L-DED processes , the impact of higher mass addition on the melt pool fluid flow and temperature distribution is significant . 
With the extracted temperature distribution and geometry at the solidification front , the solidification conditions are also calculated , as well as the primary dendrite arm spacing ( PDAS ) of the solidified tracks . 
Due to the high laser energy input , the temperature gradient is lower , and coarser microstructures are formed compared with conventional L-DED . 
A single-photon absorption 3D stereolithographic methodology is presented . 
Meso-scale architectures can be achieved with 5 μm resolution along ( x , y , z ) . 
Process parameters ( e.g . 
exposure , slicing ) adaptable to each region of the 3D design . 
3D printing of highly complex porous architectures featuring overhanging units . 
The realization of 2D and 3D meso-scale architectures is an area of research involving a wide range of disciplines ranging from materials science , microelectronics , phononics , microfluidics to biomedicine requiring millimeter to centimeter-sized objects embedding micrometric features . 
In the recent years , several technologies have been employed to provide optimal features in terms of object size flexibility , printing resolution , large materials library and fabrication speed . 
In this work , we report a fully customizable single-photon absorption 3D fabrication methodology based on direct laser fabrication . 
To validate this approach and highlight the versatility of the setup , we have fabricated a comprehensive ensemble of 2D and 3D designs with potential applications in biomimetics , 3D scaffolding and microfluidics . 
The high degree of tunability of the reported fabrication system allows tailoring the laser power , slicing and fabrication speed for each single area of the design . 
These unique features enable a rapid prototyping of millimeter to centimeter-sized objects involving 3D architectures with true freestanding subunits and micrometric feature reproducibility . 
This study focuses on the microstructure evolution induced by eutectic WC-W2C inoculants during the selective laser melting ( SLM ) of IN718 . 
The as-built microstructure observed using an electron microscope indicates that grain nucleation occurred on the surface of inoculants and that the diffusion layer between inoculants and IN718 composed of a mixture of IN718 and inoculants . 
After the post heat treatment of the as-built SLM specimens , more grains nucleated around the inoculants , and Nb-rich precipitates were formed along the grain boundaries . 
With an increase in the post heat-treatment temperature , the microstructure evolution became more pronounced . 
To elucidate the underlying mechanism , both theoretical and experimental analyses were performed . 
In summary , eutectic WC-W2C inoculants could provide heterogeneous nucleation sites for grain formation owing to the low wetting angle and the semi-coherent interface with the matrix . 
Theoretical analysis suggests that the difference in the thermal expansion coefficient between inoculants and IN718 did not provide a significant amount of residual stress . 
Thus , it can be concluded that heterogeneous nucleation is the primary mechanism by which inoculants can influence the microstructure in the present study . 
This paper presents an integrated physics-based and statistical modeling approach to predict temperature field and meltpool geometry in multi-track processing of laser powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) of nickel 625 alloy . 
Multi-track laser processing of powder material using L-PBF process has been studied using 2-D finite element simulations to calculate temperature fields along the scan and hatch directions for three consecutive tracks for a moving laser heat source to understand the heating and melting process . 
Based on the predicted temperature fields , width , depth and shape of the meltpool is determined . 
Designed experiments on L-PBF of nickel alloy 625 powder material are conducted to measure the relative density and meltpool geometry . 
Experimental work is reported on the measured density of built coupons and meltpool size . 
Statistically-based predictive models using response surface regression for relative density , meltpool geometry , peak temperature , and time above melting point are developed and multi-objective optimization studies are conducted by using genetic algorithm and swarm intelligence . 
A fragile and non-thixotropic biocompatible low molecular weight gel is printed in 3D structures by a solvent exchange process . 
The 3D printing process is based on the continuous extrusion of a solution of a small amphiphile molecule , N-heptyl-d-galactonamide , in dimethylsulfoxide , that forms a gel in contact with water . 
The diffusion of water in the dimethylsulfoxide / N-heptyl-d-galactonamide solution triggers the self-assembly of the molecule into supramolecular fibers and the setting of the ink . 
The conditions for getting a well-defined pattern and the dimensions of the constructs have been determined . 
The resulting constructs can be easily dissolved , orienting its application as a sacrificial ink or a temporary support . 
This method opens the way to the injection and the 3D printing of other fragile and non-thixotropic supramolecular hydrogels . 
Biofabrication is the process of transforming materials into systems that reproduce biological structure and function . 
Previous attempts to create biomimetic systems have often used single materials shaped into limited configurations that do not mimic the heterogeneous structure and properties of many biological tissues . 
The printer was used to fabricate a range of composite materials containing varying blends of a tough alginate/poly ( acrylamide ) ionic covalent entanglement hydrogel and an acrylated urethane based UV-curable adhesive material . 
The hard adhesive material acted as particulate reinforcement within the matrix of composites printed with a large hydrogel volume fraction . 
The composite materials were characterized mechanically and their performance could be modeled with standard composite theory . 
The platform of a 3D printer allowed these composite materials to be fabricated directly with a smooth and continuous gradient of modulus between the soft hydrogel and harder acrylated urethane material , which may be useful in the development of bio-inspired structures such as artificial tendons . 
This work investigated the utility of three piezoelectric inkjet printers as energetic material deposition systems , focusing on the ability of each system to achieve the seamless integration of energetic material into small-scale electronic devices . 
Aluminum copper ( II ) oxide nanothermite was deposited using the three deposition systems . 
The printers were evaluated based on their robustness to energetic ink solids loading , drop formation reliability , drop quality degradation over time , and the energetic performance of the deposited material . 
These metrics correlate to the feasibility of a deposition system to successfully achieve high sample throughput while maintaining the energetic performance of the printed material . 
After initial system testing , the PipeJet P9 500 μm pipe was used to demonstrate the successful deposition of nanothermite in varying geometric patterns with micrometer precision . 
Popular 3D printing techniques such as fused deposition modelling ( FDM ) and stereolithography ( SLA ) have certain limitations and challenges . 
Although printing multi-material functional parts combining smart and conventional materials is a promising area , existing printers are not ideally suited to this , with FDM printers typically requiring high operating temperatures and SLA using a tank containing one single material . 
Common 3D printers also require the deposition of additional “ support ” material to hold the shape of an object when printing overhang structures . 
The concept of adding additional rotational axes to the system to eliminate this problem has shown promising results , but such systems still lack the capability to print complex structures without supports . 
To overcome these limitations there is a need to develop a new 3D printing techniques that combine the strengths of existing methods . 
A photopolymer extrusion 3D printing technique , which combines the strengths of FDM and UV assisted 3D printing technology is demonstrated in this paper . 
By using photopolymer extrusion in combination with two additional rotational axes , the printer developed in this work not only allows the traditional layer upon layer printing , but is also capable of free form printing . 
Fumed silica is used as a filler in order to control the material viscosity for proper extrusion and curing . 
Mechanical tests were conducted on objects printed using different concentrations of filler in the photopolymer to understand its effect and determine the range of suitable filler concentration . 
Multilayer HSS alloys have been produced by laser cladding and characterized in terms of their microstructural evolution , hardness , stress state and tensile properties . 
Massive martensitic transformation during cladding of HSS alloys , resulted in the compressive state of clads and suppressed the cracking . 
Re-heating during laser cladding of thick multilayer coatings of an Fe-Cr-Mo-W-V alloy had a detrimental effect on the hardness of intermediate layers . 
Addition of Co in LC1 at the expense of Fe ( Fe−x-Cr-Mo-W-V-Cox ) significantly increased the overall coating hardness by strengthen the matrix . 
Tensile testing results showed a strong adherence of thick multilayer coatings with the substrate . 
Two high speed steel ( HSS ) alloys were laser cladded on 42CrMo4 steel cylindrical substrate by using a 4 kW Nd : YAG laser source . 
After optimization of the laser material processing parameters for single layers , multilayered clads were produced . 
Microstructural characterization of the laser deposits constitutes studies of the carbides and matrix , which was done by using Scanning Electron Microscopy ( SEM ) , Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy ( EDS ) , Electron Backscattered Diffraction ( EBSD ) and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy ( HRTEM ) .The strengthening mechanism of LC1 ( Fe-Cr-Mo-W-V ) was comprised of a martensitic matrix and retained austenite along with networks of VC and Mo2C eutectic carbides . 
Cr enriched fine carbides ( Cr7C3 and Cr23C6 ) were embedded within the matrix . 
During laser cladding of the multilayer deposits , cladding of subsequent layers had a detrimental effect on the hardness of previously cladded layers , which was due to tempering of existing lath martensite . 
To overcome the hardness drop , a new alloy LC2 ( Febal−x-Cr-Mo-W-V-Cox ) was blended by addition of 3–5 % of Co in LC1 . 
The addition of Co resulted in an overall increase in hardness and a reduction in the hardness drop during sequential layer cladding ; the latter was due to the presence of Co in the solid solution with Fe.HRTEM was performed to characterize the nanometer-sized precipitates evolved during the re-heating . 
These carbides were either enriched with V and W or formed from a complex combination of V , Mo , W and Cr with lattice spacings of 0.15 nm to 0.26 nm . 
An urgent need in the laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) process is to efficiently remove emissions from or around the moving melt pool since the powder bed contamination by spatter can potentially damage fabricated part quality . 
The objective of this study is to propose new designs of the gas flow system in the build chamber to enhance the removability of spatter . 
Specifically , a Computational Fluid Dynamics ( CFD ) model for the LPBF gas flow system has been developed to simulate the complicated flow behavior inside the build chamber . 
The movement of spatter has been calculated by the Discrete Phase Model ( DPM ) . 
The fully coupled CFD-DPM fluid-particle interaction method has been applied to capture the influence of gas flow on solid particles accurately . 
Additionally , an analytical expression is utilized to obtain the threshold velocity of inert gas flow upon the powder bed . 
The spatter distribution in a generic gas chamber design was studied . 
It was found that the Coanda effect , a gas flow downward tendency toward the substrate , can have a significant impact on the spatter removal process . 
With the proposed new designs , the Coanda effect is minimized , and most of the spatters can be removed from the build region without blowing up powder bed particles . 
Polymer extrusion three dimensional ( 3D ) printing , such as fused deposition modeling ( FDM ) , has recently garnered attention due to its inherent process flexibility and rapid prototyping capability . 
Specifically , the addition of electrical components and interconnects into a 3D printing build sequence has received heavy interest for space applications . 
However , the addition of these components , along with the thermal load associated with space-based applications , may prove problematic for typical thermally insulating 3D printed polymer structures . 
The work presented here addresses thermally conductive polymer matrix composites ( specifically , graphite , carbon fiber , and silver in an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene polymer matrix ) to identify the effect of composite geometry and print direction on thermal anisotropic properties . 
The work also examines the effect of these composites on print quality , mechanical tensile properties , fracture plane analysis , micrograph imaging , and cube satellite thermal analysis . 
The thermal conductivity of 3D printed material systems in this work may enable the production of thermally stable 3D printed structures , supports , and devices . 
Key results of this work include anisotropic thermal conductivity for 3D printed structures related to print direction and filler morphology meaning that thermal conductivity can be controlled through a combination of print raster direction and material design . 
When the materials analyzed in this work are incorporated with other active cooling systems , space-based 3D printed applications can then be designed to incorporate increasing thermal loads , opening a new door to producing space-ready 3D printed structures . 
Inverse process embedded 3D printing multi internal surfaces hydrogel and application in anatomical organ model . 
Inverse process-based printing strategies can speed up 3D printing and increase efficiency . 
Prepolymer has high transparency , and has shear thinning behavior and yield stress characteristics . 
The most current 3D printing method involves the combination of additional processes , such as casting and demolding , to produce an organ model . 
This method requires professionals to invest a considerable amount of time in editing the model and post-processing activities . 
In this work , embedded three-dimensional printing ( EMB3D ) is performed in a transparent and photocrosslinkable support medium . 
Based on a photo-curable hydrogel precursor with yield stress behavior , a new EMB3D printing strategy is developed , which could be considered as an inverse process . 
During printing , a closed shell is formed with a release ink using a capillary needle . 
After printing , the support medium is photocrosslinked to a solid part , and the object is peeled off along with the closed shell . 
The stated approach makes it possible to produce transparent and elastic solid objects with multi-internal surfaces . 
Moreover , it can be applied in providing a soft , dissectible , accurate , and highly interactive model for medical doctors to facilitate surgical processes . 
A geometry-based model for predicting lack-of-fusion porosity is presented . 
The model relies on melt pool dimension , hatch spacing and layer thickness . 
Porosity ( or density ) predicted with the model agrees well with reported literature data . 
A geometry-based simulation is used to predict porosity caused by insufficient overlap of melt pools ( lack of fusion ) in powder bed fusion . 
The inputs into the simulation are hatch spacing , layer thickness , and melt-pool cross-sectional area . 
Melt-pool areas used in the simulations can be obtained from experiments , or estimated with the analytical Rosenthal equation . 
The necessary material constants , including absorptivity for laser-based melting , have been collated for alloy steels , aluminum alloys and titanium alloys . 
Comparison with several data sets from the literature shows that the simulations correctly predict process conditions at which lack-of-fusion porosity becomes apparent , as well as the rate at which porosity increases with changes in process conditions such as beam speed , layer thickness and hatch spacing . 
To fabricate highly complex structures , sacrificial support material is usually needed . 
However , traditional petroleum-based support materials are un-sustainable , non-recyclable , and difficult to be completely removed from the target structure after 3D processing . 
Instead , cellulose nanocrystals ( CNC ) gel could serves as an interesting 3D printing support material due to its sustainability , renewability , and potential recyclability . 
Since CNCs are highly dispersible in water as nanoparticles and are also not UV sensitive , it has less absorption or bondability with other UV curable polymer matrices . 
This allows them to be completely washed out by water , which offers a green and efficient method to remove the CNC support material during post processing . 
In addition , with increasing needs for more intricate structures , combining different 3D printing strategies into a hybrid 3D printing platform can be highly beneficial . 
In this work , a multi-materials-multi-methods ( M4 ) printer with dual direct-ink-write ( DIW ) and DIW-inkjet printing capability was used to fabricate various complex structures while using CNC as support material . 
After 3D printing , water was used to remove the CNC support structure . 
Even in a highly confined environment , such as the inside of a balloon structure , CNC support material was still easily removed . 
The potential of using sustainable CNC support material and M4 hybrid 3D printing strategies to fabricate different complex structures was demonstrated . 
Since CNC gel is derived from forestry products and is entirely water based , the 3D printing process was also made more environmentally friendly , sustainable , and potentially recyclable . 
Composite coatings of titanium reinforced separately with hydroxyapatite ( HAp ) and bioglass ( BG ) were deposited on titanium substrate using Laser Engineered Net Shaping ( LENS™ ) . 
The microstructure , phase constituents , in vitro electrochemical , tribological and biological properties of these composite coatings deposited using different laser powers was studied . 
The composite coatings showed several reaction products such as Ca2P2O7 , CaTiO3 , Na2Ca2Si3O9 due to high temperature interaction of HAp and BG with Ti . 
The average top surface hardness of the Ti substrate was 148 ± 5 HV and that of the composite coatings was between 720 and 740 HV . 
As a result , the composite coatings exhibited significant increase in the in vitro wear resistance . 
The incorporation of HAp and BG in Ti increased the corrosion current , possibly due to the presence of residual stresses , but shifted the corrosion potential towards noble direction due bioactive reinforcements . 
In vitro proliferation of mouse embryonic fibroblast cells ( NIH3T3 ) was found to be more on composite coatings than on titanium substrate demonstrating their superior cell-materials interactions . 
One-photon or two photon absorption by dye molecules in photopolymers enable direct 2D & 3D lithography of micro/nano structures with high spatial resolution and can be used effectively in fabricating artificially structured nanomaterials . 
Complex 2D patterns and 3D meshes were fabricated with sub-micron resolution , in commercially available liquid photopolymer to show the impact/versatility of this technique . 
Pure Al with high laser reflectivity is essentially incompatible with laser powder bed fusion . 
The retention of a large number of unmelted particles leads to inferior geometrical quality and mechanical properties of printed pure Al parts . 
In the present study , we propose decorating Al with a small amount of high laser absorbing Co nanoparticles on the surface of Al powders to reduce laser reflectivity and improve printability . 
The near homogenous dispersion of Co slightly modified the surface chemical composition and roughened the powder surface . 
This approach completely melted the particles and eliminated the internal pores , thereby favorably tuning the geometrical dimensions . 
Additionally , the introduction of Co provided solid solution strengthening and precipitation hardening via dispersion of second-phase Al9Co2 with a coherent interfacial relationship with the Al matrix . 
The tensile properties of printed Al parts were comparable to commercial medium-strength Al alloys at an optimal Co-content of 0.5 wt. 
% . 
Addition of Nb and Mo improved the UTS and elongation of L-PBF 420 stainless steel . 
Nanoscale NbC precipitated in the presence of Nb and Mo . 
Tempering of martensites and NbC correlated with improved mechanical properties . 
Mechanical and corrosion properties of L-PBF specimens were superior to wrought 420 stainless steel . 
Niobium ( Nb ) and molybdenum ( Mo ) are conventionally added to stainless steels to improve their mechanical and corrosion properties . 
However , the effects of Nb and Mo addition on the processing and properties in laser-powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) have not been well investigated , especially in the context of 420 stainless steel . 
In this study , 420 stainless steel pre-alloyed with Nb ( 1.2 wt. 
% ) and Mo ( 0.57 wt. 
% ) was processed by L-PBF and characterized in terms of its physical , mechanical and corrosion properties as well as microstructure . 
The addition of Nb and Mo did not significantly affect the densification of 420 stainless steel when printed over an energy range of 28–75 J/mm3 and a maximum density of 99.3 ± 0.02 % theoretical at 63 J/mm3 was achieved . 
In mechanical tests , L-PBF 420 stainless steel specimens exhibited higher mechanical properties in the presence of Nb and Mo . 
After heat treatment , the UTS of 420 stainless steel with Nb and Mo improved to 1750 ± 30 MPa and elongation to 9.0 ± 0.2 % , much higher than previously reported properties achieved in L-PBF and exceeding wrought 420 stainless steel . 
The tempering of martensite phases as well as the presence of nanoscale NbC were found to correlate with improved mechanical properties . 
In electrochemical tests , 420 stainless steel exhibited slightly better corrosion properties with the addition of Nb and Mo . 
Bagasse CNF inks are produced for 3D printing by direct-ink-writing technology . 
The CNF were found not to have a cytotoxic potential . 
Alginate and Ca2+ caused significant structural changes to the 3D printed grid constructs . 
Ca2+ crosslinked constructs offer potential for personalized wound dressing devices . 
Sugarcane bagasse , an abundant residue , is usually burned as an energy source . 
However , provided that appropriate and sustainable pulping and fractionation processes are applied , bagasse can be utilized as a main source of cellulose nanofibrils ( CNF ) . 
We explored in this study the production of CNF inks for 3D printing by direct-ink-writing technology . 
The CNF were tested against L929 fibroblasts cell line and we confirmed that the CNF from soda bagasse fibers were found not to have a cytotoxic potential . 
Additionally , we demonstrated that the alginate and Ca2+ caused significant dimensional changes to the 3D printed constructs . 
The CNF-alginate grids exhibited a lateral expansion after printing and then shrank due to the cross-linking with the Ca2+ . 
The release of Ca2+ from the CNF and CNF-alginate constructs was quantified thus providing more insight about the CNF as carrier for Ca2+ . 
This , combined with 3D printing , offers potential for personalized wound dressing devices , i.e . 
Herein , we developed a direct-write printing process capable of producing versatile biomimetic patterns with aligned neurites using multiple cell types . 
After two weeks of differentiation , aligned neurites were induced by the contractile force of the printed cells . 
Finally , we demonstrated the usefulness of the printing process by fabricating a Y-shaped branch and six-layered pattern . 
The six-layered pattern mimicking cerebral cortex tissue was produced by precise printing of two different colored cells . 
These results indicate that versatile biomimetic neural constructs composed of multiple cell types can be produced by our new direct-write printing process . 
Electrets have been increasingly investigated for their high piezoelectric sensitivity for sensing and energy harvesting applications , but fabricating complex 3D structures for optimum performance has remained challenging . 
3D printing capabilities have likewise become a mature manufacturing technology widely used for end-user customization and rapid prototyping , but limitations on materials and geometries have complicated the incorporation of electroactive structures . 
In this paper , the first completely 3D printed porous piezoelectret is demonstrated . 
These samples were structured using standard infill patterns commonly used in 3D printing , allowing easy incorporation with current 3D printing technology . 
Pores generated by fused-filament fabrication ( FFF ) are characterized , charged , and the resultant piezoelectret activity measured . 
Analytical electromechanical models are used to understand and compare the measured charge density and piezoelectric coefficients . 
The piezoelectric coefficient is found to increase strongly with decreasing infill percentages . 
An average piezoelectric d33 coefficient of 87 pC N−1 is achieved for 5 % infill samples and is found to be stable for a period of at least 2 weeks , competitive with many other state-of-the-art single-pore piezoelectretic materials . 
These results provide a first step in using 3D printing techniques to optimize and integrate piezoelectrets into parts , allowing a useful new electroactive functionality for additive manufacturing . 
Three-dimensionally ( 3D ) printed flexible piezoresistive composite sensors have provided valuable solutions for the personalized therapeutic development due to their promising capability in biomonitoring applications . 
Silicone rubber ( SR ) matrix is an important candidate to enable flexibility to the 3D printed devices . 
However , 3D printing of silicone inks blended with conductive fillers is limited due to the high viscosity , long curing time , and high percolation threshold . 
In the present study , a novel high-speed material jetting ( MJ ) 3D printing of high-viscosity conductive inks based on the mixture of a UV crosslinkable silicone rubber and milled carbon fibers ( MCF ) is demonstrated . 
The MCF content was optimized for printability , UV curability , and electrical conductivity . 
The sensors ( with 30 wt . 
% MCF content ) show high flexibility and foldability as well as a high resistance sensitivity to sever bending tests . 
The stretchability of 3D printed sensors was further improved by sandwiching the MCF/SR sensing layer between the SR layers . 
The electromechanical evaluation of the sandwiched MCF/SR sensors ( S-MCF/SR ) confirmed the high piezoresistive sensitivity of sensors ( gauge factor in order of ∼400 ) . 
Finally , the 3D printed sensors were employed for monitoring human joint motions to demonstrate the potential application in monitoring biosignals . 
Polymer bonding of gas-atomized lightweight permanent magnet MnAlC particles . 
Optimized particle size leads to flexible filament with high filling factor ( 80 wt % ) . 
Extrusion of continuous permanent magnet MnAlC filaments ( length over 10 m ) . 
No deterioration of permanent magnet properties of MnAlC particles along processing . 
3D-printed permanent magnet objects avoiding the use of critical raw materials . 
Additive manufacturing is an attractive technology for many high-tech sectors such as energy , automotive and aerospace because of the freedom in designing and high performance of the fabricated objects . 
In the field of permanent magnets there is an increasing interest for applying this technology . 
However , key points need to be faced for obtaining products with non-deteriorated magnetic properties . 
Herein , we report on the preparation of MnAlC-based flexible filament with permanent magnet properties and a high filling factor of 80 wt % resulting from an optimum fine-to-coarse particle ratio ( 25/75 ) , which has been successfully used for 3D-printing magnetic objects . 
Particles of MnAlC –rare earth-free permanent magnet– have been produced in nearly spherical shape with mean sizes of 16 and 30 μm by gas atomization . 
This has allowed for the fabrication of a permanent magnet composite , MnAlC/ABS , with a large concentration of MnAlC particles . 
The methodology here used has made possible the preparation of composite , filament and 3D-printed objects with no degradation of the permanent magnet properties . 
The reported results open a new route to advance in the application of 3D-printing to fabricate permanent magnet elements with a high filling factor for technological applications . 
We introduce an algorithm to generate tool paths using G2/G3-codes . 
The algorithms reduce time and cost while they enhance the quality of printed objects . 
Extrusion-based printing frequently requires a hollowing step to remove material from inside of artifacts and subsequently reduce the amount of material , printing time , product weight , energy consumption , and ultimately , the cost . 
In addition to reducing stress concentration through their inherently smooth boundaries , these spheroids require no additional support structure , when properly designed . 
Here , spheroids are arranged by the Voronoi diagram of 3D ellipsoids and the tool path , including circular printing motions , is produced using the Voronoi diagram of circular 2D disks . 
The proposed algorithms are implemented as the HollowTron webserver and are freely available from Voronoi Diagram Research Center . 
3D printing allows rapid fabrication of complex objects from digital designs . 
One 3D-printing process , direct laser writing , polymerises a light-sensitive material by steering a focused laser beam through the shape of the object to be created . 
The highest-resolution direct laser writing systems use a femtosecond laser , steered using mechanised stages or galvanometer-controlled mirrors , to effect two-photon polymerisation . 
Here we report a new high-resolution direct laser writing system that employs a resonant mirror scanner to achieve a significant increase in printing speed over current methods while maintaining resolution on the order of a micron . 
This printer is based on a software modification to a commercially available resonant-scanning two-photon microscope . 
We demonstrate the complete process chain from hardware configuration and control software to the printing of objects of approximately 400 × 400 × 350 μm , and validate performance with objective benchmarks . 
Released under an open-source license , this work makes micron-scale 3D printing available at little or no cost to the large community of two-photon microscope users , and paves the way toward widespread availability of precision-printed devices . 
The introduction of three-dimensional ( 3D ) printing in the pharmaceutical arena has caused a major shift towards the advancement of modern medicines , including drug products with different configurations and complex geometries . 
Otherwise challenging to create via conventional pharmaceutical techniques , 3D printing technologies have been explored for the fabrication of multi-drug loaded dosage forms to reduce pill burden and improve patient adherence . 
In this study , stereolithography ( SLA ) , a vat polymerisation technique , was used to manufacture a multi-layer 3D printed oral dosage form ( polyprintlet ) incorporating four antihypertensive drugs including irbesartan , atenolol , hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine . 
Although successful in its fabrication , for the first time , we report an unexpected chemical reaction between a photopolymer and drug . 
Fourier Transform Infrared ( FTIR ) spectroscopy and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy confirmed the occurrence of a Michael addition reaction between the diacrylate group of the photoreactive monomer and the primary amine group of amlodipine . 
The study herein demonstrates the importance of careful selection of photocurable resins for the manufacture of drug-loaded oral dosage forms via SLA 3D printing technology . 
Photopolymerization-based 3D printing has emerged as a promising technique to fabricate 3D structures . 
However , during the printing process , polymerized materials such as hydrogels often become highly light-scattering , thus perturbing incident light distribution and thereby deteriorating the final print resolution . 
To overcome this scattering-induced resolution deterioration , we developed a novel method termed flashing photopolymerization ( FPP ) . 
Our FPP approach is informed by the fundamental kinetics of photopolymerization reactions , where light exposure is delivered in millisecond-scale ‘ flashes ’ , as opposed to continuous light exposure . 
During the period of flash exposure , the prepolymer material negligibly scatters light . 
The material then polymerizes and opacifies in absence of light , therefore the exposure pattern is not perturbed by scattering . 
Compared to the conventional use of a continuous wave ( CW ) light source , the FPP fabrication resolution is improved . 
FPP also shows little dependency on the exposure , thus minimizing trial-and-error type optimization . 
Using FPP , we demonstrate its use in generating high-fidelity 3D printed constructs . 
Material based actuation with metallic fibers , for example shape memory alloys ( SMA ) is gaining popularity to replace the conventional bulky actuators used for shape morphing in aerospace sectors . 
However , Joule heating arising from electrical actuation of SMA affects the interfacial bonding between the SMA and the composite matrix and thus reduces the life span of the structure . 
Insulating the SMA from the composite matrix will tremendously increase the service life of these reconfigurable structures . 
Three-dimensional ( 3D ) printing of functional elements during the fabrication phase of the composite structures permits the flexibility to form complex shaped reconfigurable lightweight aerospace components . 
Here , we present a novel technique to embed polymer encapsulated functional elements into structural composites . 
We use the direct-write ( DW ) technique to coat SMA with a polymer solution while simultaneously printing them onto carbon fiber prepreg . 
We develop high performance polymeric inks - polyetherimide and polycarbonate - compatible with the DW technique , the coating , as well as the composite . 
In addition to SMA , the technique can also be easily extended to embed various kinds of other functional fibers into composites , in any shape or form . 
Additionally , we also demonstrate the application of this technique to integrate SMA with polymeric structures towards actuators for robotics grippers or surgical tools . 
The emergence of smart technologies is spurring the development of a wider range of applications for stretchable and conformable sensors , as the design flexibility offered by additive manufacturing may enable the production of sensors that are superior to those produced by conventional manufacturing techniques . 
In this work , a multi-material 3D printing system with three extrusion heads was developed to fabricate a stretchable , soft pressure sensor built using an ionic liquid ( IL ) –based pressure-sensitive layer that was sandwiched between carbon nanotube ( CNT ) –based stretchable electrodes and encapsulated within stretchable top and bottom insulating layers . 
The sensor materials were modified in order to achieve 3D printable characteristics . 
The capability of the system was tested by printing structures made from three materials and a multilayer sensor via an extrusion-based direct-print process . 
Multi-material 3D printing of the sensor was successfully realized , as the sensing material retained its functionality once the printing process was complete . 
Silicone-based materials are commonly used in medical applications such as pre-surgery models or implants , leading to interesting biomimetic mechanical properties . 
Emergence of 3D printing and particularly liquid deposition modelling ( LDM ) has shown that specific rheological behaviors , particularly yield stress characters , were required to achieve efficient LDM . 
Unfortunately , standard silicone formulations seldom present such behaviors and are then proved to have low applicability in LDM-based 3D printing.In the present study , polyethylene glycol of different lengths were added as yield stress agents in a bi-component silicone and were demonstrated to operate a drastic improvement of the material rheological behaviors , without significant impact on the final mechanical properties of the material . 
An interesting relationship was demonstrated between dynamic yield stress values and reachable 3D geometries ( the higher σys , the more complex the 3D printed shape can be ) but the study also revealed that it is not the only key factor to ensure the printability of viscoelastic materials when highly complex geometries are seek ; tack and melt strength have also to be investigated . 
To improve the formability and properties of calcia ( CaO ) based ceramic core , the binder-jet 3D-printing was performed to fabricate porous CaO/caicium zirconate ( CaZrO3 ) ceramic core composites with two nanozirconia addition methods . 
The effects of the nanozirconia addition method and additive amount on the properties of the 3D-printed CaO/CaZrO3 bodies were investigated . 
The dimensional accuracy , surface roughness , relative density , bending strength , and hydration resistance of CaO/CaZrO3 bodies printed with a nanozirconia suspension binder for deposition in the CaO powder layer were better than those of CaO/CaZrO3 bodies printed in the traditional manner of directly mixing nanozirconia in the CaO powder . 
Application of the nanozirconia suspension uniformly capped nanozirconia particles on the surfaces of the CaO particles and filled the pores of the CaO powder layer , which afforded denser and more uniform green bodies . 
After sintering at 1500 °C , the ZrO2 formed thicker and denser CaZrO3 layers with the CaO over the CaO grain surfaces , which improved the strength and hydration resistance of the sintered CaO/CaZrO3 ceramic core bodies , and certainly reduced their collapsibility . 
A 3D numerical model is developed to study the flow mechanism with rotation nozzle at the corner under various conditions during the extrusion and deposition process ; Material rheological properties have little effects on material distribution ratio at corners , while process parameters affect material distribution ratio significantly ; Increasing corner radius and relative nozzle travel speed while decreasing nozzle aspect ratio are beneficial to suppressing uneven mass distribution at corners ; When conducting corner printing with rotational rectangular nozzle , a greater amount of material is deposited inside the filament and hence tearing and skewing will occur on the surface of the printed filament . 
With the aim of maintaining the surface finish and mechanical properties of the printed filament , a 3D numerical model is developed to study the flow mechanism at a corner under various conditions during the extrusion and deposition processes with rotational nozzle . 
After experimental validation , the numerical model is employed to study the material flow mechanism under various conditions . 
The results indicate that the rheological properties have little effect on the mass distribution ratio . 
However , a high relative nozzle travel speed , larger corner radii and lower nozzle aspect ratio is a promising route in obtaining a uniform material distribution ratio . 
The interlinking of process parameters affects the material distribution ratio significantly as well . 
Furthermore , the importance of the factors that affect the mass distribution was determined quantitatively . 
Fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) is a 3D printing technique which allows layer-by-layer build-up of a part by the deposition of thermoplastic material through a nozzle . 
The technique allows for complex shapes to be made with a degree of design freedom unachievable with traditional manufacturing methods . 
However , the mechanical properties of the thermoplastic materials used are low compared to common engineering materials . 
In this work , composite 3D printing feedstocks for FFF are investigated , wherein carbon fibres are embedded into a thermoplastic matrix to increase strength and stiffness . 
First , the key processing parameters for FFF are reviewed , showing how fibres alter the printing dynamics by changing the viscosity and the thermal profile of the printed material . 
The state-of-the-art in composite 3D printing is presented , showing a distinction between short fibre feedstocks versus continuous fibre feedstocks . 
An experimental study was performed to benchmark these two methods . 
It is found that printing of continuous carbon fibres using the MarkOne printer gives significant increases in performance over unreinforced thermoplastics , with mechanical properties in the same order of magnitude of typical unidirectional epoxy matrix composites . 
The method , however , is limited in design freedom as the brittle continuous carbon fibres can not be deposited freely through small steering radii and sharp angles . 
Filaments with embedded short carbon microfibres ( ∼100 μm ) show better print capabilities and are suitable for use with standard printing methods , but only offer a slight increase in mechanical properties over the pure thermoplastic properties . 
It is hypothesized that increasing the fibre length in short fibre filament is expected to lead to increased mechanical properties , potentially approaching those of continuous fibre composites , whilst keeping the high degree of design freedom of the FFF process . 
Water-soluble glass patterned by 3D printing is a versatile tool for tissue engineering and microfluidics . 
Glasses can be patterned layer-by-layer as in conventional fused deposition modeling but also along 3D , “ freeform ” paths . 
In the latter approach , extruding heated material through a nozzle translating in 3D space allows for fabrication of sparse , freestanding networks of cylindrical filaments . 
These freeform structures are suitable for sacrificial molding with a variety of media , leaving complex microchannel networks . 
However , 3D printing carbohydrate glass in this way presents several unique challenges : 1 ) the material must resist degradation and crystallization during printing , 2 ) the glass must be hot enough to flow freely during extrusion and fuse to the printed construct , while cooling rapidly to retain its shape upon exiting the nozzle , 3 ) the extruder needs to apply high pressure , with rapid stop and start times and 4 ) the net force that acts on the filament during extrusion must be minimized so that the filament shape is predictable , i.e. 
, coincides with the path taken by the nozzle . 
First , we review the properties of commercially available carbohydrate glasses and provide a guide for processing isomalt , our material of choice , to achieve the best printing performance . 
A pressure-controlled , piston-driven extruder is then described which allows for rapid responses and precise control over the material flow rate . 
We then analyze the heat transfer within the filament and the forces that contribute to the filament ’ s final shape . 
We find that the dominant force is due to the radial flow of the molten glass as it exits the nozzle . 
This analysis is validated on a purpose-built isomalt 3D printer , which we utilize to characterize relationships between extrusion pressure , translation speed , filament diameter , and viscous force . 
The insights of the physics of the printing process enable fabrication of intricate freeform prints as well as layer-by-layer designs . 
The practical and theoretical considerations should facilitate adoption of additive manufacturing of carbohydrate glasses with applications to a wide variety of fields , including tissue engineering and microfluidics . 
Multi-material 3D printing with several mechanically distinct materials at once has expanded the potential applications for additive manufacturing technology . 
Fewer material options exist , however , for additive systems that employ vat photopolymerization ( such as stereolithography , SLA , and digital light projection , DLP , 3D printers ) , which are more commonly used for advanced engineering prototypes and manufacturing . 
Those material selections that do exist are limited in their capacity for fusion due to disparate chemical and physical properties , limiting the potential mechanical range for multi-material printed composites . 
Here , we present an ethylene glycol phenyl ether acrylate ( EGPEA ) -based formulation for a polymer resin yielding a range of elastic moduli between 0.6 MPa and 31 MPa simply by altering the ratio of monomer and crosslinker feedstocks in the formulation . 
This simple chemistry is also well suited to form seamless adhesions between mechanically dissimilar formulations , making it a promising candidate for multi-material DLP 3D printing . 
Preliminary tests with these polymer formulations indicate that variability due to molecular differences between hard and soft formulations is less than 3 % of the prescribed model dimensions , comparable to existing commercial DLP and SLA resins , with unique advantages of a wide range of elastomer stiffness and seamless fusion for 3D printing of structurally detailed and mechanically heterogeneous composites . 
We introduce a novel divide-and-conquer approach for 3D printing , which provides automatic decomposition and configuration of an input object into print-ready components . 
Our method improves 3D printing by reducing material consumption , decreasing printing time , and improving fidelity of printed models . 
Then the configuration phase provides a robust algorithm to pack the components for an efficient print job . 
Our results show that the framework can reduce print time by up to 65 % ( fused deposition modeling , or FDM ) and 36 % ( stereolithography , or SLA ) on average and diminish material consumption by up to 35 % ( FDM ) and 10 % ( SLA ) on consumer printers , while also providing more accurate objects . 
Conventional 3D printing approaches are restricted to building up material in a layer-by-layer format , which is more appropriately considered “ 2.5-D ” printing . 
The layered structure inherently results in significant mechanical anisotropy in printed parts , causing the tensile strength in the build direction ( z-axis ) to be only a fraction of the in-plane strength – a decrease of 50–75 % is common . 
In this study , a novel “ z-pinning ” approach is described that allows continuous material to be deposited across multiple layers within the volume of the part . 
The z-pinning process is demonstrated using a Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) printer for polylactic acid ( PLA ) and carbon fiber reinforced PLA . 
For both materials , z-pinning increased the tensile strength and toughness in the z-direction by more than a factor of 3.5 . 
Direct comparisons to tensile strength in the x-axis showed a significant decrease in mechanical anisotropy as the volume of the pin was increased relative to the void in the rectilinear grid structure . 
In fact , the PLA sample with the largest pin volume demonstrated mechanically isotropic properties within the statistical uncertainty of the tests . 
Tensile test results were also analyzed relative to the functional area resisting deformation for each sample . 
Digital light processing 3D printing method was used to fabricate conductive parts . 
MWCNTs were used with photocurable resin to form conductive ink for 3D printing . 
Complicated 3D conductive structures were demonstrated . 
These structures can be used as capacitive sensors and shape memory composites . 
3D printing has gained significant research interest recently for directly manufacturing 3D components and structures for use in a variety of applications . 
In this paper , a digital light processing ( DLP® ) based 3D printing technique was explored to manufacture electrically conductive objects of polymer nanocomposites . 
Here , the ink was made of a mixture of photocurable resin with multi-walled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs ) . 
The concentrations of MWCNT as well as the printing parameters were investigated to yield optimal conductivity and printing quality . 
We found that 0.3 wt % loading of MWCNT in the resin matrix can provide the maximum electrical conductivity of 0.027S/m under the resin viscosity limit that allows high printing quality . 
With electric conductivity , the printed MWCNT nanocomposites can be used as smart materials and structures with strain sensitivity and shape memory effect . 
We demonstrate that the printed conductive complex structures as hollow capacitive sensor , electrically activated shape memory composites , stretchable circuits , showing the versatility of DLP® 3D printing for conductive complex structures . 
In addition , mechanical tests showed that the addition of MWCNT could slightly increase the modulus and ultimate tensile stress while decreasing slightly the ultimate stretch , indicating that the new functionality is not obtained at the price of sacrificing mechanical properties . 
3D printing technology has revolutionized the field of machinery , aerospace , and electronics . 
To address the shortcomings of previous studies on improving the poor mechanical properties of the resin used in 3D printers , this study presents a technology for fabricating short fibres or a continuous fibre-composite material using stereolithography 3D printing . 
Glass powder and fibreglass fabric were used as the discontinuous and continuous fibre reinforcement of light-cured resin material . 
The tensile strength and Young ’ s modulus showed a marked increase : these were 7.2 and 11.5 times higher than those of the resin specimen , respectively . 
The 3D printing of fiber-reinforced soft composites ( FrSCs ) is a hybrid process that combines conventional inkjet-based 3D printing with the directed deposition of electrospun polymer fiber mats . 
This paper investigates the spreading characteristics of droplets when deposited on fibrous substrates , under conditions relevant to 3D printing of aligned FrSCs . 
High-speed imaging is used to study the characteristic time-scales and the spreading behavior of the droplets . 
The single droplet impingement studies on stationary substrates reveal that the presence of fibers promotes droplet spreading along the length of the fibers . 
Occasional surface energy variations in the fiber mats in the form of voids and fiber bundles are also seen to affect the droplet shape and the characteristic spreading times . 
In the case of a moving substrate , the droplets are seen to spread the most during in-line printing , i.e. 
, when the direction of the printing velocity coincides with the direction of fiber alignment . 
They spread the least during orthogonal printing , i.e. 
, when the direction of the printing velocity is perpendicular to the direction of fiber alignment . 
The findings of the high-speed imaging studies have been confirmed by 3D printing comparable artifacts using UV curable inks . 
These studies indicate that for a given fiber mat and UV curable ink combination , the choice of the in-line or orthogonal printing strategy has implications for the overall printing time , fiber content , edge resolution and surface quality of the 3D printed FrSC part . 
Multi-material extrusion in 3D printing is gaining attention due to a wide range of possibilities that it provides , specially driven by the commercial availability of a large variety of non-conventional filament materials . 
With this in mind , this paper addresses the mechanical performance of multi-material printed objects , specially focused on the interface zone generated between the different materials at their geometrical boundaries . 
Tensile test specimens were designed and printed in three types : ( A ) a single-material specimen printed by a single extrusion head ; ( B ) a single-material but multi-section specimen printed in a zebra-crossing structure by two extrusion heads ; and ( C ) a multi-material specimen printed with two materials in a zebra-crossing pattern . 
The materials considered were PLA , TPU and PET . 
The comparison of the mechanical performance between Type-A and -B specimens demonstrated the negative influence of the presence of a geometrical boundary interface between the same material . 
The methodology proposed to assess the quality of the pairs of materials selected is innovative , and enabled to depict the importance of the boundary design in multi-material printing techniques . 
The aim of the present work was to develop a pilot scale process to produce drug-loaded filaments for 3D printing of oral solid dose forms by fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) . 
Using hot melt extrusion , a viable operating space and understanding of processing limits were established using a hydrophilic polymer ( hydroxypropyl methylcellulose ( HPMC ) – Affinisol™ LV15 ) . 
From the process development work , challenges in achieving a pilot scale process for filament production for pharmaceutical applications have been highlighted . 
3D printing trials across the range of compositions demonstrated limitations concerning the ability to print successfully across all compositions . 
Results from characterisation techniques including thermal and mechanical testing when applied to the formulated filaments indicated that these techniques are a useful predictive measure for assessing the ability to print a given formulation via filament methods . 
However , fabrication methods using three-dimensional ( 3D ) bioprinters are limited by the simple nozzle-based extrusion or uncontrollability of photo-reactive systems . 
Hence , most studies on inducing topographical cues were focused on two-dimensional ( 2D ) surface structures and based on imprinting and soft-lithography processes . 
Although 2D patterned surfaces provide outstanding insight into optimal patterned architectures by facilitating the analysis of various myoblast responses , it can be difficult to achieve complex 3D structures with microscale topographical cues . 
For this reason , we propose a new strategy for obtaining topographical cues in 3D printed synthetic biopolymers for regenerating muscle tissue . 
A uniaxially aligned pattern was obtained on the struts of the matrix composed of poly ( ε-caprolactone ) ( PCL ) or poly ( lactic-co-glycolic acid ) ( PLGA ) , by taking advantage of the immiscible rheological properties and flow-induced force in the dispersed pluronic F-127 phase ( sacrificial material ) and matrix materials . 
Stereolithography is a 3D printing technique in which a liquid monomer is photopolymerized to produce a solid object . 
Photoinitiators can absorb UV or ( less often ) visible light , producing radicals for direct decomposition or hydrogen abstraction . 
In fact , vegetable oils contain unsaturations , and thus , they can be exploited as monomers . 
In particular , linseed oil , tung oil or edible oils ( soybean , sunflower or corn ) could be good candidates as raw materials . 
Unfortunately , the photoinduced radical polymerization of these oils either does not occur or is too slow for 3D printing applications . 
For this reason , the oils were modified as epoxides . 
Epoxides are monomers that are more reactive than natural oils , and they can be polymerized via a cationic mechanism . 
The aim of this work was to exploit visible light generated by a common digital projector ( like those used in classrooms ) as a light source .

2 step process developed to screen 3-D prints for mechanical functionality . 
3D printing functional parts with known mechanical properties is challenging using variable open source 3D printers . 
This study investigates the mechanical properties of 3D printed parts using a commercial open-source 3D printer for a wide range of materials . 
The samples are tested for tensile strength following ASTM D638 . 
The results are presented and conclusions are drawn about the mechanical properties of various fused filament fabrication materials . 
The study demonstrates that the tensile strength of a 3D printed specimen depends largely on the mass of the specimen , for all materials . 
Thus , to solve the challenge of unknown print quality on mechanical properties of a 3D printed part a two step process is proposed , which has a reasonably high expectation that a part will have tensile strengths described in this study for a given material . 
This mass is compared to the theoretical value using densities for the material and the volume of the object . 
This two step process provides a means to assist low-cost open-source 3D printers expand the range of object production to functional parts . 
Novel blend feedstocks developed using recycled plastic materials . 
Blend composition and processing conditions optimized for morphology/interfacial adhesion . 
Blend perform on par with commercial HIPS filaments . 
Recycled polymer blends are valid feedstocks for AM and could be used for manufacturing in remote environments . 
Consumer-grade plastics can be considered a low-cost and sustainable feedstock for fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) additive manufacturing processes . 
Such materials are excellent candidates for distributed manufacturing , in which parts are printed from local materials at the point of need . 
Most plastic waste streams contain a mixture of polymers , such as water bottles and caps comprised of polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ) and polypropylene ( PP ) , and complete separation is rarely implemented . 
In this work , blends of waste PET , PP and polystyrene ( PS ) were processed into filaments for 3D printing . 
The effect of blend composition and styrene ethylene butylene styrene ( SEBS ) compatibilizer on the resulting mechanical and thermal properties were probed . 
Recycled PET had the highest tensile strength at 35 ± 8 MPa . 
Blends of PP/PET compatibilized with SEBS and maleic anhydride functionalized SEBS had tensile strengths of 23 ± 1 MPa and 24 ± 1 MPa , respectively . 
The non-compatibilized PP/PS blend had a tensile strength of 22 ± 1 MPa . 
PP/PS blends exhibited reduced tensile strength to ca . 
Elongation to failure was generally improved for the blended materials compared to neat recycled PET and PS .

Porous tricalcium phosphate ( TCP ) scaffolds are becoming more and more important for treating musculoskeletal diseases . 
With the maturation of 3D printing ( 3DP ) technology in the past two decades , porous TCP scaffolds can also be easily prepared with complex design and high dimensional accuracy . 
However , the mechanical and biological properties of porous TCP scaffolds prepared by 3D printing still need improvements . 
In this study , novel 3D printed TCP and MgO/ZnO-TCP scaffolds were prepared by an binder-jet 3D printer . 
Scaffolds had a dense core and porous surface feature with a designed pore size of 500 μm and a designed porosity of 18 % . 
After printing , scaffolds were sintered in a muffle furnace at 1250 °C . 
The presence of MgO and ZnO increased the surface area of TCP from 1.18 ± 0.01 m2/g to 2.65 ± 0.02 m2/g , the bulk density from 37.89 ± 0.83 % to 50.82 ± 1.10 % , and the compressive strength from 17.94 ± 1.65 MPa to 27.46 ± 2.63 MPa . 
Enhanced osteoblast proliferation was shown in doped 3D printed TCP scaffolds compared to the pure 3DP TCP . 
In addition , the use of 3D printing as well as dense core and porous surface design enhanced the surface roughness and osteoblast proliferation of TCP scaffolds . 
This novel 3D printed MgO/ZnO-TCP scaffold shows enhanced mechanical and biological properties , which is promising for orthopedic and dental applications . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) , which is also referred to as 3D printing , is a class of manufacturing techniques that fabricate three dimensional ( 3D ) objects by accumulating materials . 
Constrained surface based stereolithography is one of the most widely used AM techniques . 
In the process , a thin layer of liquid photosensitive resin is constrained between a constrained surface and the platform or part . 
The light penetrates the transparent constrained surface and cures that layer of liquid polymer . 
Then the platform is moved up to separate the newly cured layer to let new liquid resin fill into the gap and get cured . 
The separation of newly cured layer from the constrained surface is a grand challenge that limits the printable size and printing speed in this manufacturing technique . 
Numerous experimental works have been performed to understand how to reduce the separation force in the process . 
In this paper we study a new design of constrained surface with radial groove texture that significantly influences the effectiveness of reduction of the separation force and hence the manufacturing capability via theoretical modeling . 
The proposed model is validated with numerical simulations demonstrating an excellent agreement . 
We demonstrate the possibility of drastic reduction of the separation force ( up to 112 % ) via surface texturing of the permeable window for continuous 3D printing . 
A novel large-scale 3D printer is introduced . 
A full scaffolding solution allows any 3D geometry to be printed . 
Part geometry errors are detected and corrected using geometric feedback . 
Although additive manufacturing ( AM ) is now a well-established industry , very few large-scale AM systems have been developed . 
Here , a large-scale 3D printer is introduced , which uses a six-degree-of-freedom cable-suspended robot for positioning , with polyurethane foam as the object material and shaving foam as the support material . 
Cable-positioning systems provide large ranges of motion and cables can be compactly wound on spools , making them less expensive , much lighter , more transportable , and more easily reconfigurable , compared to the gantry-type positioning systems traditionally used in 3D printing . 
The 3D foam printer performance is demonstrated through the construction of a 2.16-m-high statue of Sir Wilfrid Laurier , the seventh Prime Minister of Canada , at an accuracy of approximately 1 cm , which requires 38 h of printing time . 
The system advantages and drawbacks are then discussed , and novel features such as unique support techniques and geometric feedback are highlighted . 
PA/ABS blend optimized formulation improved bead-bead adhesion in 3-D printing . 
Anisotropy ratio ( z property/x property ) indicator of bead-bead adhesion . 
Small-scale printing can provide test case for large-scale printed material properties . 
SMA was an effective compatiblizer for PA/ABS blends at printed interface . 
For additive manufacturing interfacial adhesion ( bead-bead ) remains an important issue affecting uniformity of mechanical properties . 
The present work examined the role a compatibilizer would play when used in fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) printing . 
Both small and large-scale 3-D component properties were examined . 
The mechanical property anisotropy ratio , an indication of bead-bead adhesive strength ( defined as a property measured along the z axis versus the x axis ) is representative of adhesive strength . 
Large-scale ( big area additive manufacturing , BAAM ) tests ( flexural properties ) showed 62 % improvement in the anisotropy ratio for modulus , 77 % improvement in the anisotropy ratio of the strength , 56 % improvement in the anisotropy ratio of elongation at break , and 55 % improvement of the anisotropy ratio of the Charpy impact strength over the control PA values . 
Thus , use of compatibilized polymer blends can provide customized materials without the need for new chemistry . 
Addition of maleic anhydride-compatibilized ABS improved PA blend bead-bead adhesion .

3D-printed objects can be remotely actuated via magnetic fields . 
Magnetic hydrogels have a myriad of promising applications including soft electronics , flexible robotics , biomedical devices , and wastewater treatment . 
However , their potential is limited by conventional fabrication methods which impede creating convoluted geometries . 
3D printing may replace traditional fabrication techniques as it has an ability to fabricate complex shapes using a wide variety of materials . 
A new 3D printing ink , a bionanocomposite based on alginate , methylcellulose and magnetic nanoparticles ( MNPs ) was used to print pre-designed high-quality 3D structures . 
Three-dimensional hydrogel constructs had good mechanical stability and exhibited responsiveness to an applied magnetic field . 
Inclusion of the MNPs within the hydrogel and its precursor ( ink ) influenced their rheological properties - and mechanical stability . 
MNPs were found to play dual roles : ( 1 ) as a nanofiller that interacts with polymer backbone and alters its physicochemical properties , and ( 2 ) as a function provider that renders a bionanocomposite magnetic . 
The magnetic ink allows for the fabrication of multi-material structures such as hydrogels with a magnetic nanoparticle gradient . 
3D-printed objects can be remotely actuated via magnetic fields . 
Reactive magnesium oxide cement ( RMC ) is gaining increasing attention as a sustainable construction material due to its significantly low carbon footprint during the production as well as the operational phase compared to the conventional Portland cement . 
Whereas several studies have demonstrated the potential of RMC as a suitable and environment-friendly construction material , this study reports that RMC can be shaped into complex structures via three-dimensional ( 3D ) printing technology . 
By adding suitable additives and only 3 wt . 
% of caustic magnesium oxide to the commercially available RMC , appropriate rheology and buildability were achieved that enabled smooth 3D printing of complex structures with precise shape retention . 
Moreover , the 3D printed RMC exhibited higher densification and nearly twofold the compressive strength as compared to its cast counterpart . 
Therefore , this work demonstrates the potential of RMC as a 3D printable construction material for sustainable and modern architecture . 
Achievement of optimized lateral and vertical resolution is a key factor to obtaining three-dimensional ( 3D ) structural details fabricated through digital light processing ( DLP ) -based 3D printing technologies which exploit digitalized ultraviolet ( UV ) or near-UV light to trigger localized photopolymerization forming solid patterns from liquid polymer resins . 
Many efforts have been made to optimize printing resolution through improving the optical systems . 
However , researchers have paid comparatively little attention to understand the influences of polymer formulation on the printing resolution and surface quality . 
Here , we report an investigation on the effects of in-house formulated ( meth ) acrylate-based photopolymer constituent types and concentrations on the resolution and quality of structures printed on a bottom-exposure DLP-based 3D printing system . 
We examined a wide variety of resin formulations to determine optimal formulations that yield best printing resolution and surface quality over a reasonably broad range of mechanical properties . 
We demonstrated the controlled fabrication of sub-pixel conical and aspherical smooth features , whereby the shape and dimensions could be prescribed with the resin formulation and process parameters . 
Such features hold promising implications in micro-optic and microfluidic fabrication using the DLP-based 3D printing technique . 
Use of this solution minimized the ‘ stair-stepping ’ effect in components printed in a layer-by-layer manner . 
Taken together , the present findings provide a basis for optimized photopolymer resin formulations that retain maximum vertical and lateral resolutions and minimal surface roughness and layering artifacts for a versatile range of mechanical and rheological properties suited to novel applications in 3D printing of smooth free-form solids , micro-optics , and direct fabrication of microfluidic platforms with functional surfaces . 
The optimization of slurry compositions and processing parameters has significant potential for layered extrusion forming , a novel slurry-based additive manufacturing method . 
The optimal slurry composition was composed of 50vol. 
% Al2O3 loading , 1.5wt. 
% acetic acid as dispersant and 2wt. 
% methylcellulose solution as binder . 
The processing parameters including layer height , print speed and nozzle diameter significantly influenced the fabrication quality . 
The orthogonal experiment showed that the print speed of 15mm/s , nozzle diameter of 0.40mm and layer height set as 70 % of nozzle diameter was the optimized processing conditions . 
The lattice structure constructed under the optimized conditions exhibited uniform and well-shaped morphology before and after sintering . 
The solid-infilled ceramic specimen prepared via optimized parameters exhibited uniform structure and the surface roughness was 0.75μm , which greatly improved the surface quality . 
Current 3D printing capabilities onboard the International Space Station ( ISS ) are classified as experimental payloads . 
As payloads the products of these printers are returned to the ground for testing and analysis . 
However , it has long been thought that 3D printing must one day become a tool of space operations much like the electrical diagnostic equipment , and the soldering iron . 
This paper explores a case study in the use of one of the payload 3D printers to manufacture a device to be used by the crew as part of nominal ISS Operations . 
The path from concept development through onboard printing and crew inspection will be described . 
The lessons learned from this process are reviewed as constructive feedback on how existing processes can be expanded to enable this capability in the future . 
This experience will be carried forward into the development of a new process which will open the door for future use of 3D printing onboard the ISS . 
Continuous fiber–reinforced thermosetting polymer composites ( CFRTPCs ) were prepared via three–dimensional ( 3D ) printing . 
Typical process parameters were systematically investigated over a wide range . 
3D printed CFRTPC samples exhibited maximum flexural strength and modulus of 952.89 MPa and 74.05 GPa , respectively . 
Mechanical performance of the optimized process has increased nearly an order of magnitude than the previous reports . 
Advanced composite structures can be 3D printed for potential applications in the future research . 
Continuous fiber-reinforced thermosetting polymer composites ( CFRTPCs ) were prepared via three-dimensional ( 3D ) printing in this study . 
The entire process was divided into impregnation , printing , and curing stages . 
The impregnation stage ensured a tightly bonded interface and uniform distribution of fibers and resin . 
The printing stage solved the great conveying resistance and poor adhesion caused by the addition of continuous fibers . 
The curing stage aimed to preserve the shapes of the pre-formed samples and completed the polymerization and crosslinking reactions . 
An investigation into the experimental design focused on optimizing the parameters of the manufacturing process , wherein printing speed , printing space , printing thickness , curing pressure , and curing temperature were selected as target variables . 
Finally , 3D printed CFRTPC samples with 58 wt. 
% fiber content exhibited maximum flexural strength and modulus of 952.89 MPa and 74.05 GPa , respectively . 
Moreover , complex CFRTPC components were fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility and generality of the proposed technique . 
These results may broaden the potential use of 3D printed CFRTPCs in aerospace , defense , and automotive applications . 
A hybrid multi-objective optimization approach is proposed to optimize the printed line quality . 
The inherent contradiction is analyzed by a statistical response surface methodology . 
The robust 3D optimal Pareto front is identified based on statistical uncertainty and a genetic algorithm . 
Aerosol jet printing ( AJP ) is an emerging 3-dimensional ( 3D ) printing technology to fabricate customized and conformal microelectronic components on various flexible substrates . 
Although the AJP technology has the capability of depositing fine features , the inherent contradiction between the printed line thickness and line edge roughness has a great impact on the printed line quality . 
The proposed approach consists of a central composite design ( CCD ) , a response surface methodology , a desirability function approach and a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III ( NSGA-III ) . 
In the proposed approach , the response surface methodology is combined with the CCD to investigate and quantify the correlations between the printed line features and the key process parameters . 
And the conflicting relationship between the printed line edge roughness and line thickness is identified by the CCD derived response surface models ( RSMs ) . 
The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid multi-objective optimization approach is beneficial to minimize the conflict between the printed line features , hence the lines can be produced with low line edge roughness and sufficient line thickness . 
Different from a traditional trial-and-error method in AJP , the proposed printing quality optimization approach is developed based on the principles of statistical modeling , analysis of variance and global optimization . 
Therefore , the proposed printing quality optimization approach is more efficient and systematic . 
Moreover , the data-driven based characteristic makes the proposed approach applicable to other multi-objective optimization researches in additive manufacturing technologies . 
We explore elastic wave focusing and enhanced energy harvesting by means of a 3D-printed Gradient-Index Phononic Crystal Lens ( GRIN-PCL ) bonded on a metallic host structure . 
The lens layer is fabricated by 3D printing a rectangular array of cylindrical nylon stubs with varying heights . 
The stub heights are designed to obtain a hyperbolic secant distribution of the refractive index to achieve the required phase velocity variation in space , hence the gradient-index lens behavior . 
Finite element simulations are performed on composite unit cells with various stub heights to obtain the lowest antisymmetric mode Lamb wave band diagrams , yielding a correlation between the stub height and refractive index . 
The elastic wave focusing performance of lenses with different design parameters ( gradient coefficient and aperture size ) is simulated numerically under plane wave excitation . 
It is observed that the focal points of the wider aperture lens designs have better consistency with the analytical beam trajectory results . 
Experiments are conducted using a PA2200 nylon lens bonded to an aluminum plate to demonstrate wave focusing and enhanced energy harvesting within the 3D-printed GRIN-PCL domain . 
The results show that 3D printing can provide a simple and practical method for implementing phononic crystal concepts with minimal modification of the host structure . 
The spatial orientation of an object on a 3D printing plate is a significant contributor to its printing time . 
Thus , the speed of the 3D printing processes can generally be increased by using time-efficient object orientations . 
This paper presents a novel method for speeding-up printing processes that employs maximally efficient orientations . 
This method finds an orientation for the object that minimizes the number of disconnected components and the distance between the disconnected components that remain , thereby minimizing the time needed for the printer head to traverse empty areas . 
The method also considers the height of the printed object , its trapped volume , and the number of connected components in each layer . 
Our novel algorithm considers all four criteria , each weighted according to printer-specific and experimentally-obtained parameters . 
Preliminary trials demonstrate that this methodology can decrease printing times on fused deposition printers to 45 % of that of current state of the art algorithms . 
Waveguides are important optical elements for sensing , illumination , artistic displays , integrated optical circuits , as well as teaching aids for demonstrating important optical phenomena . 
However , despite the high demand , most optical materials are difficult to fabricate into desired shapes using state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies . 
This paper presents a novel method for 3D printing customizable optics with a soft and stretchable ( over 100 % elastic strains ) thermoplastic polymer . 
To showcase the versatility of this approach , several applications were demonstrated , including unique artistic illumination , caustic patterns , beam splitter and combiner on both planar and 3D conformal surfaces , and optical encoder . 
The simplicity of the fabrication process , low-cost , excellent optical properties , and flexibility provide an attractive pathway for fabricating integrated optical devices and new opportunities for controlling light .

However , a lack of materials suitable for inkjet printing poses one of the key challenges that impedes industry from fully adopting this technology . 
Consequently , many industry sectors are required to spend significant time and resources on formulating new materials for an AM process , instead of focusing on product development . 
To achieve the spatially controlled deposition of a printed voxel in a predictable and repeatable fashion , a combination of the physical properties of the ‘ ink ’ material , print head design , and processing parameters is associated . 
Use of a liquid handler containing multi-pipette heads , to rapidly prepare inkjet formulations in a micro-array format , and subsequently measure the viscosity and surface tension for each in a high-throughput manner is reported . 
The throughput is 96 formulations per 13.1 working hours , including sample preparation and subsequent printability determination . 
The HTS technique was validated by comparison with conventional viscosity and surface tension measurements , as well as the observation of droplet ejection during inkjet printing processes . 
Using this approach , a library of 96 acrylate/methacrylate materials was screened to identify the printability of each formulation at different processing temperatures . 
The methodology and the material database established using this HTS technique will allow academic and industrial users to rapidly select the most ideal formulation to deliver printability and a predicted processing window for a chosen application . 
Controlling cooling airflow is feasible in FFF process for enhancing performance . 
Cooling airflow has opposite influence on geometric quality and mechanical strength . 
Void and crystallinity of printed PLA model are influenced by the airflow cooling . 
The dimensional quality and mechanical properties of a fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) -printed 3D model are influenced by several process parameters . 
A forced-air cooling system that moves along with the print head was designed and installed on a commercial 3D FFF printer to control the cooling of the printed model . 
The quality of the printed polylactide ( PLA ) model , including the dimensions and mechanical properties , was investigated for different cooling air velocities . 
It was found that the cooling air velocity had different influences on the dimensional quality and mechanical strength of the printed model . 
More specifically , higher cooling speeds generated better geometric accuracy but lower mechanical strength . 
With the highest and lowest cooling air speeds of 5 m/s and 0 m/s , respectively , the tensile strengths of the printed models differed by 4-fold . 
In order to determine a suitable cooling air velocity setting for each specific printing material , a design model was proposed . 
The determined printing parameters were employed in the fabrication of a Rubik ’ s cube , as an example . 
The assembled cube demonstrated satisfactory performance both in the dimensional quality and in the mechanical function . 
Therefore , the cooling air velocity can be employed as an additional control parameter in 3D printing for a specified model . 
Material extrusion additive manufacturing is widely used for porous scaffolds in which polymer filaments are extruded in the form of log-pile structures . 
These structures are typically designed with the assumption that filaments have a continuous cylindrical profile . 
However , as a filament is extruded , it interacts with previously printed filaments ( e.g . 
on lower 3D printed layers ) and its geometry varies from the cylindrical form . 
No models currently exist that can predict this critical variation , which impacts filament geometry , pore size and mechanical properties . 
Therefore , expensive time-consuming trial-and-error approaches to scaffold design are currently necessary . 
Multiphysics models for material extrusion are extremely computationally-demanding and not feasible for the size-scales involved in scaffold structures.This paper presents a new computationally-efficient method , called the VOLume COnserving model for 3D printing ( VOLCO ) . 
The VOLCO model simulates material extrusion during manufacturing and generates a voxelised 3D-geometry-model of the predicted microarchitecture . 
The extrusion-deposition process is simulated in 3D as a filament that elongates in the direction that the print-head travels . 
For each simulation step in the model , a set volume of new material is simulated at the end of the filament . 
When previously 3D printed filaments obstruct the deposition of this new material , it is deposited into the nearest neighbouring voxels according to a minimum distance criterion . 
This leads to filament spreading and widening.Experimental validation demonstrates the ability of VOLCO to simulate the geometry of 3D printed filaments . 
In addition , finite element analysis ( FEA ) simulations utilising 3D-geometry-models generated by VOLCO demonstrate its value and applicability for predicting mechanical properties . 
The presented method enables structures to be validated and optimised prior to manufacture . 
Potential future adaptations of the model and integration into 3D printing software are discussed . 
A new stitching algorithm that self-adapts to the object geometry is introduced . 
For slender objects , printing time can be reduced by 25 % with the new algorithm . 
An inevitable trade-off between resolution and total size exists when 3D printing objects . 
While it is capable of reaching a sub-micron feature size , it needs to combine a high precision movement mechanism with a lower precision one when writing centimetric size objects . 
As is demonstrated on a winding microfluidic channel , this can lead to substantial manufacturing time gains of up to 25 % . 
In this paper , a non-conventional way of additive manufacturing , curved-layered printing , has been applied to large-scale construction process . 
Despite the number of research works on Curved Layered Fused Deposition Modelling ( CLFDM ) over the last decade , few practical applications have been reported . 
The method was evaluated with the 3D Concrete Printing process developed at Loughborough University . 
The evaluation of the method including the results of simulation and printing revealed three principal benefits compared with existing flat-layered printing paths , which are particularly beneficial to large-scale AM techniques : ( i ) better surface quality , ( ii ) shorter printing time and ( iii ) higher surface strengths . 
Despite the enormous potential of additive manufacturing in fabricating three-dimensional battery electrodes , the structures realized through this technology are mainly limited to the interdigitated geometries due to the nature of the manufacturing process . 
This work reports a major advance in 3D batteries , where highly complex and controlled 3D electrode architectures with a lattice structure and a hierarchical porosity are realized by 3D printing . 
Microlattice electrodes with porous solid truss members ( Ag ) are fabricated by Aerosol Jet 3D printing that leads to an unprecedented improvement in the battery performance such as 400 % increase in specific capacity , 100 % increase in areal capacity , and a high electrode volume utilization when compared to a thin solid Ag block electrode . 
Further , the microlattice electrodes retain their morphologies after 40 electrochemical cycles , demonstrating their mechanical robustness . 
These results indicate that the 3D microlattice structure with a hierarchical porosity enhances the electrolyte transport through the electrode volume , increases the available surface area for electrochemical reaction , and relieves the intercalation-induced stress ; leading to an extremely robust high capacity battery system . 
Results presented in this work can lead to new avenues for improving the performance of a wide range of electrochemical energy storage systems . 
Pores are common defects in the process of directed laser deposition ( DLD ) which not only greatly reduce the fracture toughness of ceramic materials , but also lead to the failure of shaped parts . 
In this paper , the formation mechanism of pores was analyzed and the effects of laser power , feeding rate , scanning speed and ultrasonic power on pores were investigated . 
Transmission electron microscope , scanning electron microscopy observation and X-ray diffraction analysis were carried out for sample microstructure and phase composition respectively . 
The relative density of samples was measured by the progressive focused ion beam and the porosity was calculated by image processing software Image . 
The results show that the pores are divided into gas holes and shrinkage cavities . 
The appearance of circular gas holes with smooth inner walls are caused by the feeding method by gas forced blowing , the gas mixed with powder itself , and the gas in the molten pool formed by gasification of low-melting impurities and alumina/zirconia during laser processing . 
The gas holes are evenly distributed in the cross-section of the thin-walled specimen parallel to the scanning speed . 
As the temperature changes drastically , the material around the melt solidifies first , the melt will be attached to the solidified material to shrink , so that the melt can not be filled as a solid and finally the shrinkage cavities are formed . 
Generally the shrinkage cavities are irregular and the pore wall is relatively rough , mainly concentrated on the top of thin-walled samples . 
The laser power has the greatest influence on the pores , which has the greatest effect on the porosity but little effect on the shrinkage cavities . 
When the ultrasonic power is 180 W , the porosity reaches a minimum of 0.1±0.05 % and the relative density is 99.9±0.1 % . 
Traditional three-dimensional ( 3D ) bioprinting techniques of reactive materials usually include a mixing step of reactive agents prior to deposition , leading to potential changes in the rheological and biocompatibility properties of the resulting ink . 
During intersecting jets printing , reactive materials are dispensed separately , colliding and mixing with each other in air before landing on a previously deposited layer . 
While this enables reactive material printing using a printing-then-mixing approach , the resulting excess fluid may compromise the printing quality and accuracy . 
This study aims to improve the performance of intersecting jets–based reactive material printing by introducing a stainless-steel wire mesh and fibrous tissue paper–based liquid-absorbing system , which functions as a method to remove the excess resultant liquid from the printing zone . 
By selecting a proper wire mesh , the proposed liquid-absorbing system can absorb up to 65–90 % of the excess liquid ( water herein ) resulting from printing aqueous reactive sodium alginate and calcium chloride inks , which are selected as model materials in this study . 
By controlling the tilt angles of intersecting jets , the incident angle of post-collision droplets is desirable to be less than 14° to avoid droplet bouncing on the top of a previously deposited layer during 3D bioprinting . 
Using the liquid-absorbing system , different 3D structures have been successfully printed using intersecting jets printing . 
For tubular alginate constructs printed in air from sodium alginate and calcium chloride inks , a 2.5 height-diameter ratio can be achieved . 
The proposed printing technology does not influence the post-printing cell viability while printing 3T3 cells , demonstrating its promising potential for bioprinting applications . 
Methodology and challenges of 3D printing repairs outlined . 
Repeatable geopolymer temperature sensor presented . 
Adhesion strength between printed patch and concrete substrate 0.6 MPa . 
This paper addresses this issue by outlining , for the first time a 3D printable temperature sensing repair for concrete . 
The multifunctional material used in this study is a geopolymer : a durable alternative to ordinary Portland cement repairs , which can be electrically interrogated to act as a sensor . 
In this paper , we outline the material and 3D printing process development , and demonstrate 3D printed repair patches with a temperature sensing precision of 0.1 °C , a long-term sensing repeatability of 0.3 °C , a compressive strength of 24 MPa , and an adhesion strength to concrete of 0.6 MPa . 
The work demonstrates the feasibility of using additive manufacturing as a new means of applying repairs to concrete substrates , and provides one clear pathway to removing some of the barriers to the field deployment of multifunctional materials in a civil engineering context . 
The process shown here could enhance the design versatility of self-sensing repairs , unlock remote deployment , and de-cost and de-risk actions that prolong the lifespan and performance of existing concrete structures . 
Brittle polymers suffer from the lack of stretchability , which limits their application when large deformation is required . 
To address this limitation , we investigate the stretchability of a set of cellular materials with conventional and novel cell architectures through 3D printing , experimental testing , and computational simulation . 
The presence of sharp corners restricts the stretchability of the honeycomb and arrowhead cellular architectures . 
A new class of accordion-like cellular architecture with sinusoidal struts is designed to enhance the planar stretchability of cellular solids . 
These accordion-like sinusoidal architectures exhibit an enhancement in the stretchability of the cellular materials even for those samples fabricated from brittle polymers . 
The manufacturability of the proposed architectures is demonstrated utilizing SLA and FDM additive manufacturing techniques . 
We customize the 3D printing settings to fabricate specimens with tailored architectures for experimental testing . 
Comparing the stress-strain curves obtained by experimental testing on the 3D printed samples with numerical simulation confirms that the failure strains for sinusoidal architectures can be as high as 20 times that of conventional honeycombs without compromising the energy absorption efficiency of the cellular materials . 
The stress-strain curves for 3D printed samples fabricated from flexible polymers are presented to show that energy dissipation in a hysteresis loop also can be enhanced by exploiting the accordion-like sinusoidal architectural designs . 
The sinusoidal struts in accordion-like cellular architectures offer a design route to extend the material property chart to achieve ultrahigh stretchability in lightweight 3D printable brittle and flexible polymers for applications that require combined stretchability , lightweighting , and energy absorption such as soft robotics , stretchable electronics , and wearable protection shields . 
In additive construction , ambitious goals to fabricate a concrete building in less than 24 h are attempted . 
This analysis included a study of the variation in comprehensive layer print times , expected trends and forecasting for what is expected in future prints of similar types . 
Furthermore , the study included a determination and comparison of print time , elapsed time and construction time , as well as a look at the effect of environmental conditions on the delay events . 
Upon finishing , the analysis concluded that the 3D printed building was completed in 14-hours of print time , 31.2-hours elapsed time , or a total of 5 days of construction time . 
Anisotropy of mechanical properties and support material removing are the two main problems when fabricating 3D lattice structures by integrated printing via additive manufacturing ( AM ) technology . 
Aiming at these two problems , a snap-fit method is introduced into PolyJet technology to fabricate polymer lattice structures with four typical configurations , namely BCC , BCC-Z , FCC and octet . 
Uniaxial compression tests indicate that both the strengths and energy absorptions of the four kinds of snap-fitted lattices are increased by over 100 % compared to the integrated counterparts . 
The effect of strut thickness on compressive responses of the snap-fitted and integrated lattices is investigated . 
With the decrease of strut thickness , the advantage in the strength of the snap-fitted lattices becomes more obvious compared to the integrated counterparts . 
Ideal maximum strength models based on yield , elastic buckling and inelastic buckling are developed and are able to predict the compressive peak strengths of the snap-fitted PolyJet lattices . 
This study opens up an avenue for the fabrication of large scale 3D printed lattice structures with optimal mechanical properties and without support material removing problem . 
This paper aims to study the mechanical properties of mixed isotropic carbon fiber 3D printed composites and further investigates the influence of hot press on the [ 0°/45°/90° ] 2 fiber angles composite with varying temperature , pressure and time . 
Tensile tests , autoclave treatment and microstructural observation were utilized to characterize the composites . 
Results revealed that the [ 0°/45°/90° ] 2 performed the highest tensile strength of 79 MPa and modulus of 3.51 GPa , compared to [ 30°/45°/60° ] 2 and [ 15°/45°/75° ] 2 . 
This is due to the fibers along the tensile axis angle that bears maximum load in longitudinal direction . 
At 200 °C temperature , the hot pressed composites presented the highest tensile strength of 98 MPa and modulus of 3.93 GPa than non-hot pressed . 
Increased temperature caused better interface wettability between fibers and matrix . 
At 200 kPa pressure , the hot pressed composites showed the highest tensile strength of 100 MPa and modulus of 4.06 GPa than non-hot pressed . 
Further increased pressure resulted in lower tensile strength and modulus , as the material became stiffer pushing more matrix material to side leaving numerous fibers unbounded by the matrix . 
For 30 min withholding time , the hot pressed composites indicated the highest tensile strength of 106 MPa and modulus of 4.27 GPa than non-hot pressed . 
Increased time caused strongest interface bonding by removing the air gaps induced during printing between fibers and matrix . 
Results revealed that hot press significantly improved the mechanical properties of carbon fiber 3D printed composites . 
To realize the full potential of 3D Printing technology in the design of materials and structures , it is indispensable to characterize and predict the mechanical response of 3D Printing materials to external stimuli . 
This study is focused on hyperelastic strain measurements and constitutive parameters identification of 3D printed soft polymers undergoing uniaxial deformation . 
A simple method using an optical camera in conjunction with an image processing tool is proposed to accurately measure the average strain experienced by rubbery polymers during a tensile test . 
The potential of the method is demonstrated through tensile tests of 3D printed soft polymer by accurately determining the stress–strain response and the Poisson 's ratio without using extensometers . 
Influence of printing direction on the anisotropic behavior of 3D printed polymer is investigated by applying the proposed test method to specimens printed in two different directions . 
The Neo-Hookean constitutive parameters of the soft polymer are determined from the experimentally obtained stress–strain data . 
Moreover , finite element analysis ( FEA ) of the soft polymer is performed to show that the constitutive parameters determined can predict the mechanical response of the tested polymer accurately if used in commercial FEA packages . 
The additive manufacturing of structural composites is a disruptive technology currently limited by its moderate mechanical properties . 
Continuous fibre reinforcements have recently been developed to create high performance composites and open up encouraging prospects . 
In addition , to apply these materials to engineering applications , it is of high importance to evaluate the effect of environmental conditions on their mechanical performances , particularly when moisture-sensitive polymer is used ( PolyAmide PA for instance ) which is currently lacking in the literature.This present article aims to investigate in more detail the relationship between the process , the mechanical behaviour and the induced properties of continuous carbon and glass fibres reinforced with a polyamide matrix manufactured using a commercial 3D printer . 
In addition , their hygromechanical behaviour linked to moisture effect is investigated through sorption , hygroexpansion and mechanical properties characterization on a wide range of relative humidity ( 10–98 % Relative Humidity RH ) .The printing process induces an original microstructure with multiscale singularities ( intra/inter beads porosity and filament loop ) . 
Longitudinal tensile performance shows that the reinforcing mechanism is typical of composite laminates for glass and carbon . 
However , the rather poor transverse properties are not well fitted by the Rule Of Mixture ( ROM ) , thus underlining the specificity of the printing-induced microstructure and an anisotropic behaviour in the material.Non-negligible ( 5–6 % ) moisture uptake is observed at 98 % RH , as well as orthotropic hygroscopic expansion of PA/carbon and PA/glass composites . 
The consequences of various moisture contents on mechanical properties are studied , showing a reduction of PA/carbon stiffness and strength of 25 and 18 % in the longitudinal direction and 45 and 70 % in the transverse direction . 
For PA/glass composites , we obtain a reduction in strength of 25 % in the longitudinal direction , along with a 80 % reduction of stiffness and 45 % in strength in the transverse direction . 
Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) is one of the most popular 3D printing processes that can be used to manufacture flexible parts . 
In this work , we investigate the impact of stacking sequence , slit size , and thickness on the tensile properties of 3D printed flexible kirigami specimens . 
In addition , we demonstrate how the transition phenomenon and out-of-plane deformation can significantly improve percent elongation at their breaking point . 
Considering the deformed shape during testing , specimens with a combination of layers printed along and transverse to their length showed the highest tensile break strength and the percent break elongation ( 2.43 MPa and 183 % , respectively ) . 
It is also determined that the occurrence of the transition phenomenon depends on the specimen ’ s thickness , and was observed for the 1 mm and 1.5 mm thick samples . 
The heating of a polymer in a liquefier of a material extrusion 3D printer is numerically studied . 
The polymer is taken as a generalized Newtonian fluid with a dynamical viscosity function of shear rate and temperature . 
The system of equations is solved using a finite element method . 
The boundary conditions are adapted by comparison with the previous work of Peng et al . 
[ 5 ] showing that the thermal contact between the polymer and the liquefier is very well established . 
The limiting printing conditions are studied by determining the length over which the polymer temperature is below the glass transition temperature . 
This provides a simple relation for the inlet velocity as a function of the working parameters and the polymer properties . 
The use of 3D printing technologies enhanced with component placement and electrical interconnect deposition enables electronic systems with freedom in fabrication and complex embedded circuitry . 
However , with more electrical functionality being integrated , new material requirements become increasingly important . 
This paper introduces a novel approach for processing adhesives with an extrusion-based UV-assisted 3D dispensing process . 
A specimen study revealed promising results for three out of six adhesives ( denoted as A , D , E ) , for which an extensive anisotropy evaluation was performed : The relationship between the layered construction strategy and the material properties of the printed parts was characterized by micrograph analysis , tensile testing along with fracture analysis and laser flash analysis . 
An exemplary study for one adhesive via tensile testing showed no significant difference between three printing orientations . 
However , different construction strategies influenced the degree of anisotropy . 
In addition , the evaluation of thermal anisotropy revealed a link between the thermal conductivity and the rate of the UV-curing for A and D. For material E , no significant difference was measured . 
The work presented in this article shows that dual-curing adhesives , in particular epoxy systems , are promising choices for additive manufacturing : It was possible to print fine geometries with good material properties and low anisotropy . 
The findings serve to derive first design rules and provide a basis for further studies . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) , more commonly referred to as 3D printing , is revolutionizing the manufacturing industry . 
With any new technology comes new rules and guidelines for the optimal use of said technology . 
Big Area Additive Manufacturing ( BAAM ) , developed by Cincinnati Incorporated and Oak Ridge National Laboratory ’ s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility , requires a host of new design parameters compared to small-scale 3D printing to create large-scale parts . 
However , BAAM also creates new possibilities in material testing and various applications in the manufacturing industry . 
Most of the design constraints of small-scale polymer 3D printers still apply to BAAM . 
Beyond those constraints , new rules and limitations exist because BAAM ’ s large-scale system significantly changes the thermal properties associated with small-scale AM . 
This work details both physical and software-related design considerations for additive manufacturing . 
After reading this guide , one will have a better understanding of slicing software ’ s capabilities and limitations , different physical characteristics of design and how to apply them appropriately for AM , and how to take the inherent nature of AM into consideration during the design process . 
Additive manufacturing is considered a promising technology for many applications , such as in the construction industry . 
However , the size of a design is constrained by the chamber volume of the 3D printer , and large-scale additive manufacturing technology with flexible equipment is still unproven . 
This paper proposes a large-scale 3D printing system composed of multiple robots working in collaboration . 
For this flexible and extensible 3D printing system , the influences of the multi-robot layout on the maximum reachable area and the geometry adaptability are discussed . 
Furthermore , a printer task optimized scheduling algorithm based on efficiency egalitarianism is proposed in this paper , and a robot interference avoidance strategy is designed by dividing the printing layer into several safe areas and interference areas . 
Poly ( lactic acid ) ( PLA ) and PLA grafted cellulose nanofibers ( PLA-g-CNFs ) mixture were extruded into filaments , and subsequently 3D printed into composites . 
As-3D printed composites were then thermally annealed at a temperature above PLA glass transition temperature ( Tg ) . 
Dynamic mechanical analysis , including temperature ramp , frequency sweep , and creep for annealed composites , confirmed the enhanced responses to various viscoelastic factors . 
Such enhancements were ascribed to the presence of PLA crystalline regions containing both ɑ and ɑʹ phases , which were induced and developed through the annealing treatment . 
After 3-point bending test at 70 °C , unannealed composites were partially damaged , while annealed composites preserved the originally well-integrated layer structures . 
Experimental creep and recovery data essentially fitted to the Burger ’ s model and Weibull ’ s distribution function , respectively . 
The calculated parameters ( e.g. 
, moduli ) from numerical fitting curves demonstrated the synergetic effect of PLA-g-CNFs and annealing treatment on the enahncement of flexural properties for 3D printed PLA composites . 
Patient-specific tissue-mimicking phantoms have a wide range of biomedical applications including validation of computational models and imaging techniques , medical device testing , surgery planning , medical education , doctor-patient interaction , etc . 
Although 3D printing technologies have demonstrated great potential in fabricating patient-specific phantoms , current 3D printed phantoms are usually only geometrically accurate . 
Mechanical properties of soft tissues can merely be mimicked at small strain situations , such as ultrasonic induced vibration . 
Under large deformation , the soft tissues and the 3D printed phantoms behave differently . 
The essential barrier is the inherent difference in the stress-strain curves of soft tissues and 3D printable polymers . 
This study investigated the feasibility of mimicking the strain-stiffening behavior of soft tissues using dual-material 3D printed metamaterials with micro-structured reinforcement embedded in soft polymeric matrix . 
Three types of metamaterials were designed and tested : sinusoidal wave , double helix , and interlocking chains . 
Even though the two base materials were strain-softening polymers , both finite element analysis and uniaxial tension tests indicated that two of those dual-material designs were able to exhibit strain-stiffening effects as a metamaterial . 
The effects of the design parameters on the mechanical behavior of the metamaterials were also demonstrated . 
The results suggested that the fabrication of patient-specific tissue-mimicking phantoms with both geometrical and mechanical accuracies is possible with dual-material 3D printed metamaterials . 
Direct ink writing with acoustophoresis is used to write tailored composite filaments . 
Nozzle rotational asymmetry and printer calibration influence direction dependence . 
Yield stress fluid support geometry influences direction dependence . 
Direct ink writing enables deposition of multiphase filaments with designed microstructures . 
Using acoustophoresis , we establish a narrow distribution of microparticles at the center of a direct-write nozzle . 
The distribution shifts and widens after deposition depending on the printing direction . 
We use particle image velocimetry and digital image analysis to identify flows transverse to the printing direction and characterize particle distributions in the printed filament . 
Sources of direction-dependent effects include square nozzles , co-deposition of support material , a rotationally asymmetric microstructure established in the nozzle , and speed inaccuracies that occur in 3-axis gantries . 
We propose an analytical model for predicting print direction-dependent flows and particle distributions as a function of anisotropy of the particle distribution in the nozzle , a disturbed zone near the nozzle , fluid reshaping of the print bead , uniform rotation of the print bead , calibration of the ink and support nozzle positions , and 3D printer motor error . 
Using the model , we propose strategies for controlling direction dependent microstructures in direct ink writing . 
The analytical model can be easily adapted to similar direct-write applications to diagnose sources of direction dependent microstructures . 
Freeform 3D printing combined with sacrificial molding promises to lead advances in production of highly complex tubular systems for biomedical applications . 
Here we leverage a purpose-built isomalt 3D printer to generate complex channel geometries in hydrogels which would be inaccessible with other techniques . 
To control the dissolution of the scaffold , we propose an enabling technology consisting of an automated nebulizer coating system which applies octadecane to isomalt scaffolds . 
Octadecane , a saturated hydrocarbon , protects the rigid mold from dissolution and provides ample time for gels to set around the sacrificial structure . 
With a simplified model of the nebulizer system , the robotic motion was optimized for uniform coating . 
Using a combination of stimulated Raman scattering ( SRS ) microscopy and X-ray computed tomography , the coating was characterized to assess surface roughness and consistency . 
Colorimetric measurements of dissolution rates allowed optimization of sprayer parameters , yielding a decrease in dissolution rates by at least 4 orders of magnitude . 
Spontaneous Raman scattering microspectroscopy and white light microscopy indicate cleared channels are free of octadecane following gentle flushing . 
The capabilities of the workflow are highlighted with several complex channel architectures including helices , blind channels , and multiple independent channels within polyacrylamide hydrogels of varying stiffnesses . 
This study is an investigation on the size dependence of strength of a 3D printed acrylic polymer . 
3D printed beams are used in three-point bend fracture experiments . 
Three print modes of the PolyJet process are used to manufacture beams of dimensions commonly considered in 3D printed structures ( 1–5 mm ) . 
It is found that for that range of dimensions , the fracture response is in the nonlinear size-strength domain and specimens neither follow the limiting linear elastic fracture mechanics nor the strength criterion . 
Consequently , strength and toughness are size dependent . 
Moreover , a strong interaction between specimen dimensions and print layer thickness was found . 
A size threshold exists below which there appears to be an interaction between specimen dimensions and print layer thickness , and for specimens of dimension below that threshold exhibit a declining strength with size . 
From the present experiments , the size threshold is estimated to be 50 times the print layer thickness . 
The finding of a maximum strength relative to geometric dimensions should be accounted for in designing with 3D printed materials . 
In conventional additive manufacturing , most processes for creating the layers of a part are performed on a horizontal plane . 
In contrast , a conformal additive manufacturing process has been suggested in order to build a real 3D structure on a freeform surface using a direct-print process based on material extrusion . 
A new algorithm was developed that is able to use the standard 3D printing file format that includes both a 3D model to be printed and a 3D model of a freeform substrate along with the desired printing parameters as input , and it returns G-code instructions for the 3D printing process as output . 
A slicing surface was generated to slice the 3D model by offsetting the surface of a freeform substrate model by a discrete amount ( i.e. 
, layer thickness ) for each layer . 
The perimeters of each layer ( including the internal features ) were extracted based on the intersections between the slicing surface and the 3D model , and infill toolpaths were created by projecting 2D patterns reflecting the features to be printed with a desired fill factor ( in the x–y plane ) onto the slicing surface to create 3D patterns . 
Several 3D models were sliced and printed on a freeform surface to validate the developed algorithm . 
A laser enhanced direct print additive manufacturing process is proposed for 3D printing optical interconnects An optical interconnect is directly printed on a circuit board for the first time using this process Transmitted optical power of the 3D printed optical fiber interconnects is 63 % of that of a commercial fiber in these preliminary prototypes Processing conditions are established using fluid flow and heat transfer modeling Integrated photonics have many compelling advantages for computing and communication applications , including in high-speed and extremely wide bandwidth operations . 
Current systems are typically hybrid assemblies of packaged photonic devices where printed circuit boards often serve to route electrical signals and power , and in some cases , have runs of optical fibers . 
We present a flexible , low cost assembly method of optical interconnects for photonic systems that could enable higher transmission rates , lower power requirements , improved signal integrity and timing , less heat generation , and improved security of communication signals . 
The new process is based on laser enhanced direct print additive manufacturing ( LE-DPAM ) that combines fused deposition modeling ( FDM ) of plastic , micro-dispensing of rubber-like materials , and picosecond laser subtraction . 
The process is demonstrated by fabricating few-mode and multi-mode optical fibers in a controlled manner such that compact , 3-dimensional optical interconnects can be printed along non-lineal paths . 
We have produced working optical interconnects with fiber core diameters from 70-μm to as small as 12-μm . 
Our results demonstrate surface roughness of less than 100 nm , and optical transmitted power of 63 % that of a commercial fiber , for proof of concept devices . 
The LE-DPAM approach could lead to large scale integrated photonic computing devices that would replace our current generation of servers , computers , and phones . 
In this paper , we investigated the process variable effects on the damage and deformational behavior of fused deposition modeling ( FDM ) three-dimensional ( 3D ) -printed specimens by performing tensile tests and inverse identification analyses . 
A characterization of the effects of different parametric variations of 3D-printed specimens on fracture properties are a matter of considerable significance that are often overlooked . 
By combining the infill density and the layer thickness options that are available in the 3D printer machine , six groups with different structural configurations can be obtained . 
The data and images obtained from experiments are employed to investigate the failure mechanism of 3D-printed specimens and demonstrate the relationship that exists between structural variations and fracture mechanical properties . 
On the basis of experimental results , a Gurson-type porous plasticity model was used within a 3D continuum finite element model to characterize the process–damage parameter relationship through an inverse identification process . 
A PDMS contacting layer with nano-scaled pillars and an oxygen-permeable membrane were bonded together as the composite functional release film of rapid stereolithography . 
Optical simulations demonstrated that the nano-texture would not influence the curing effect of the resin . 
Nowadays , along with the demand for new technologies and new materials , a revolution in 3D printing technology is emerging . 
In recent years , stereolithography 3D printing has been widely used in both academia and industry , due to its fast forming speed , high precision , and low-cost advantages . 
The continuous liquid interface production technology has made the printing speed even faster . 
However , the process of resin refilling constrains the printing speed and the printing capabilities of such technologies , since only hollow structures can be fabricated . 
In this study , a nano-textured hydrophobic PDMS contacting layer and an oxygen-permeable membrane were bonded together as the functional release film . 
The oxygen inhibition layer was successfully maintained by the molecular oxygen permeated through the composite release film , achieving rapid stereolithography , and key factors that affecting resin refilling are selectively studied by the orthogonal experiment . 
Additionally , optical simulations also demonstrated that the nano-texture would not influence the curing effect of the resin . 
This work proposed a promising strategy for rapid stereolithography of 3D models containing larger cross-sectional areas . 
A nano-textured PDMS contacting layer and an oxygen-permeable membrane were bonded together as the printing substrate , providing high oxygen permeability to form an oxygen inhibition layer . 
The introduction of the nano-texture on PDMS not only increased the refilling speed of the resin by two times and reduced the printing time by nearly 25 % , and the printing reliability of larger cross-sectional areas was remarkably improved.Download : Download high-res image ( 272 Fracture , the breakdown of materials as cracks advance , is one of the most intriguing materials phenomena ; it can happen even to very tough biological tissues including tendons , skin , bone and teeth , materials whose critical physiological functions can be compromised by structural irregularities . 
It has been suggested that creating composites by mixing heterogeneous constituents of contrasting material properties can yield designs that can better adapt to stress concentration , leading to synthetic materials with higher toughness than their constituents . 
Here , an optimization algorithm is used to assess material fracture resistance in the presence of a crack . 
The analysis is further extended through experiments that involve the use of additive manufacturing . 
Optimal solutions are composed solely of soft and stiff material elements , and are compared to various benchmarks . 
Multi-material three-dimensional-printing ( 3D-printing ) is used to create material samples . 
Experimental results and mechanical testing show that an algorithmic design coupled with 3D-printing technology can generate morphologies of composites more than 20 times tougher than the stiffest base material , and more than twice as strong as the strongest base material . 
Direct comparison of strain fields around cracks shows excellent agreement between simulation and experiment . 
The results suggest that the systematic use of microstructure optimization to generate enhanced fracture resistance constitutes a new materials design paradigm . 
Three-dimensional ( 3D ) printed highly conductive graphene-based nanocomposites have led to a paradigm shift in the development of flexible electronics as well as customized therapeutic devices . 
This article addresses the deployment and characterization of a piezoelectric-pneumatic material-jetting ( PPMJ ) additive manufacturing process to print graphene-based nanocomposites with 3D structures . 
Here , development of a graphene-silicone ink , so-called MJ-3DG , with a high content of graphene ( 70 wt % ) and its adoption for the PPMJ process to 3D print a highly conductive graphene-silicone structure is demonstrated . 
The robust 3D printed structure from MJ-3DG ink with the surface roughness around 2.99 ( µm ) has the resistivity as low as 0.41 ( Ω.cm ) . 
This low resistivity is fairly comparable with the previously reported extrusion-based 3D-printed graphene structures that are the highest among all the carbon-based 3D-printed structures reported to date . 
Furthermore , in contrast to the extrusion-based systems , the high process speed ( up to 500 mm/s ) and the drop-on-demand nature of PPMJ provide internal design flexibility for 3D printed structures and make the development of smart graphene-based electronic and biomonitoring devices possible . 
Owing to the lack of optimization , the dimensional accuracy of low-cost 3D printers is quite limited . 
In order to enhance the performances of a Prusa i3 3D printer , an optimization challenge was assigned to the students of the Specializing Master in Industrial Automation of the Politecnico di Torino . 
The enhancements were applied to four printers by manufacturing new self-replicated parts by means of the same 3D printers . 
The benchmarking involved the fabrication of replicas of an innovative reference artifact by means of the modified printers . 
A coordinate measuring machine ( CMM ) was then used to inspect the dimensions of the replicas . 
Measures were used to compare the performances of the four optimized printers in terms of dimensional accuracy using ISO IT grades . 
The form errors of the geometrical features of the replicas were also evaluated according to the GD & T system . 
The benchmarking results show that the most effective modifications to the original printer were those related to the improvement of the structure stiffness and chatter reduction . 
Extrusion-based 3D printing of photo-curable hydrogel materials can be used for the generation of complex objects layer by layer without the need for molds . 
Photo-curing often is the final step of the 3D printing process , fixing the shape of the generated object . 
However , the fabricated objects have to support themselves before curing , limiting the size of the objects . 
In this contribution , intermediate curing after completing each individual layer with poly ( ethylene glycol ) diacrylate as a radically curing hydrogel system was investigated compared with single curing of the whole structure after complete layered deposition , and its effect on the mechanical properties and achievable object size was assessed . 
Defect-free hydrogel samples for mechanical testing were obtained with an optimized washing/swelling protocol . 
It was found that hydrogel objects cured after completion without intermediate curing steps had the highest fracture stresses and compression at break with 32.5 N cm−2 and 44 % , respectively . 
With increasing intermediate curing time , both the fracture stress and the compression at break decreased down to 7.8 N cm−2 and 26 % , respectively , for 5 s intermediate curing . 
Long intermediate curing times between the layers lead to preferred crack formation parallel to the layers due to decreased chemical bonding . 
However , the formation of higher hydrogel objects than enabled by the yield stress of the hydrogel was only possible with intermediate curing due to the better self-support of partially cured objects . 
The effect of printing speed on quality of parts fabricated via Binder Jetting process is experimentally evaluated . 
The dimensional accuracy of printed samples reduces linearly with increasing printing speed due to the enhanced spreading of droplets under more significant inertia forces . 
Saturation level of printed features is also linearly influenced by the printing speed , which can be attributed to increase of dimensional inaccuracy . 
Binder Jetting Process is an Additive Manufacturing technique ( AM ) in which a liquid binder is employed for establishing the initial strength and fabricating the geometry of components . 
In this process , the delivery of the binding agent is accomplished through a drop-on-demand ( DOD ) printhead by deposition of picoliter-sized droplets of the liquid binder . 
The velocity of the droplets impinging the powder bed surface might have significant effect on droplet spreading and absorption dynamics , which can be manifested in quality and integrity of the fabricated parts . 
In the present study , the effect of the printing speed on dimensional accuracy and equilibrium saturation level of printed samples is experimentally investigated and the observed trends are discussed in detail . 
Big Area Additive Manufacturing ( BAAM ) is a large format additive manufacturing ( AM ) process . 
However , at this scale , lack of high print resolution and extruder flowrate control lead to potentially significant geometric deviations in the printed part . 
Multi-resolution printing , extrusion diversion , and feedforward extruder control are examined herein . 
These methods were all found to be effective in mitigating phenomena detrimental to geometric part quality on the BAAM process . 
A space frame lattice and shell finite element model was created to predict the linearly elastic response of test coupons made with a modified polyetherimide ( PEI ) material . 
This approach was employed because it provides an efficient procedure to design and optimize 3D printed parts . 
The modeled coupons were 3D printed by extrusion of molten thermoplastic polymer . 
The finite element model was verified by comparing the predicted values of elastic modulus , shear modulus , and Poisson ’ s ratio in two material directions with the corresponding values obtained from quasi-static mechanical experiments . 
The values obtained for the moduli and the Poisson ’ s ratios from the finite element model matched closely with those obtained from the experiments . 
Material extrusion additive manufacturing ( MEAM ) , also known as three-dimensional ( 3D ) printing , is a popular additive manufacturing technique suitable for producing 3D shapes using thermoplastic materials . 
The majority of companies that design and test 3D printing machines work with thermoplastic acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS ) and polylactic acid ( PLA ) filaments . 
It is , however , crucial to utilize different types of filaments for a broader range of applications with different mechanical property requirements . 
MEAM techniques may be used for the production of SMP-based parts , allowing for smart structures to be created in a wide variety of geometries . 
In this work , a commercial 3D-printer was used to produce 3D printed polyurethane-based SMP specimens . 
Mechanical and thermomechanical testing was conducted to study the effects of testing temperatures and annealing heat treatments on the tensile and shape memory properties of the samples . 
3D printing was shown to be a suitable technique for producing SMP parts capable of retaining good shape memory characteristics . 
Different annealing heat treatments and test temperatures were found to have considerable effects on the SMP specimen properties . 
In particular , annealing the specimens at 85 °C for 2 h helped to improve the rate of shape recovery and the consistency of mechanical test results . 
A systematic approach on the numerical simulation of electrified jet printing is studied . 
The Volume of Fluid ( VOF ) method which suits for modeling multiphase flows with a continuous interface is used . 
The surface tension force is calculated with the Continuum Surface Force ( CSF ) method and the electric forces are added to the momentum equation by taking the divergence of the Maxwell stress tensor . 
Employing these dimensionless numbers , the number of effective parameters is reduced , and a relative comparison of the importance of competing forces on the process becomes possible . 
In this study , an elastoplastic constitutive model is developed to implement a quantitative description of the mechanical behavior of materials fabricated by stereolithography ( SLA ) . 
Considering the characteristics of the SLA printing process and the influence of the printing angle and layer thickness , the transversely isotropic elastic model and the Hill anisotropic yield model are used to describe the mechanical behavior of SLA-printed materials . 
In the analysis of the elasticity and strength of SLA-printed materials , equations to predict the elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength are derived . 
Uniaxial tensile tests are carried out to obtain the elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength of the standard SLA-printed materials under different printing angles and layer thicknesses . 
The parameters of the constitutive model are employed in ABAQUS to simulate the mechanical behavior of a cellular structure and compare it with the experimental results . 
The results demonstrate that the elastoplastic constitutive model developed in this study can effectively describe the mechanical behavior of SLA-printed materials . 
Transparent materials for fused filament fabrication printers are widely available and may be useful for constructing 3D printed devices with applications in UV/VIS spectroscopy . 
In this study , colourless polylactic acid , HD Glass and T-Glase were evaluated as construction materials for biochemical sensors , which contain immobilised enzymes , for analysis by UV/VIS spectrophotometry . 
Experiments were conducted on both the native 3D print and after coating with XTC-3D® , a transparent epoxy resin used to improve optical transparency of 3D prints . 
Individual enzymes were immobilised within the 3D prints by coupling the enzymes to tosyl-activated magnetic beads and attracted to the print surface by magnets embedded in the 3D print . 
A transparent 3D printed device was demonstrated using enzymatic assays of lactose and glucose . 
Further studies showed that enzyme assays performed in these 3D printed devices are reproducible , accurate and of comparable sensitivity to the same assays performed in polystyrene cuvettes . 
Additive manufacturing is now considered as a new paradigm that is foreseen to improve progress in many fields . 
The field of tissue engineering has been facing the need for tissue vascularization when producing thick tissues . 
The use of sugar glass as a fugitive ink to produce vascular networks through rapid casting may offer the key to vascularization of thick tissues produced by tissue engineering . 
Here , a 3D printer head capable of producing complex structures out of sugar glass is presented . 
This printer head uses a motorized heated syringe fitted with a custom made nozzle . 
The printer head was adapted to be mounted on a commercially available 3D printer . 
A mathematical model was derived to predict the diameter of the filaments based on the printer head feed rate and extrusion rate . 
Using a 1 mm diameter nozzle , the printer accurately produced filaments ranging from 0.3 mm to 3.2 mm in diameter . 
One of the main advantages of this manufacturing method is the self-supporting behaviour of sugar glass that allows the production of long , horizontal , curved , as well as overhanging filaments needed to produce complex vascular networks . 
Finally , to establish a proof of concept , polydimethylsiloxane was used as the gel matrix during the rapid casting to produce various “ vascularized ” constructs that were successfully perfused , which suggests that this new fabrication method can be used in a number of tissue engineering applications , including the vascularization of thick tissues . 
3D printable zwitterionic nanoclay hydrogel with self-supporting abilities . 
Printing speed had a considerable effect on the material ’ s tensile properties . 
Increased aging time of the pre-gels significantly reduced strain at failure . 
Excellent recovery of compressed hydrogels when left for 24 h at room temperature . 
A UV-curable nanoclay-zwitterionic hydrogel is synthesised and evaluated though rheological and mechanical testing . 
Compression and tensile samples are printed and compared to cast samples . 
The pre-gel aging time showed that an increased time resulted in a lower strain at failure for both cast and extruded samples . 
Furthermore , the compressed samples display self-healing abilities at room temperature and almost completely returns to its original state before compression occurred . 
Net-shape 98 % dense objects have been fabricated from a rapidly solidified ferrous powder using binder jet 3D printing and molten bronze infiltration . 
X-ray diffraction , scanning electron microscopy , and differential thermal analysis were used to characterize the structural evolution of the powder feedstock during an infiltration heating cycle . 
Microindentation and bend tests were performed on the infiltrated material to evaluate its mechanical properties . 
It was found that infiltration improved the strength of the sintered preforms by eliminating the stress concentration points at interparticle necks . 
We have printed microscale 3-dimensional tissue scaffolds using cellulose acetate ( CA ) for the first time and produced a range of pore sizes ranging from 99 to 608 μm that are potentially favorable for tissue engineering . 
In the process we have elucidated some of the formulation-fabrication-morphology relationships which enabled advancements in ink development , optimization of fabrication parameters , and morphological control . 
We believe this study will increase the knowledge base for additive manufacturing of CA and enable further research into the use of 3D-printed CA for tissue engineering applications . 
Also , our findings on printing optimization may provide some practical principles and methodologies that are applicable for the ink development using other biomaterials . 
Anisotropy in dielectric properties can have deleterious effects in structures intended for use in high-field environments . 
We show that dielectric anisotropy is introduced into parts fabricated using additive manufacturing techniques based on the orientation in which the part is printed . 
Dielectric strength testing data , based on the ASTM D149 standard , are presented for samples fabricated using the polymer jetting ( PolyJet ) , stereolithography ( SLA ) , fused deposition modeling ( FDM ) , and selective laser sintering ( SLS ) additive manufacturing techniques . 
Each printing technique was found to introduce anisotropic dielectric properties within the sample coupons that were a function of the original orientation in which the part was printed , and the direction of structural susceptibility was found to be print-method dependent . 
Differences in dielectric strength for coupons printed in different orientations were found to exceed 70 % for some combinations of printing technique and polymer . 
Overall , test coupons printed with stereolithography ( SLA ) were found to exhibit the lowest degree of dielectric strength anisotropy between print orientations .

Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) technologies are widely used in various fields of industry and research . 
Continual research has enabled AM technologies to be considered as a feasible substitute for certain applications in the construction industry , particularly given the advances in the use of glass fibre reinforced mortar . 
An investigation of the resulting mechanical properties of various mortar mixes extruded using a robotic arm is presented . 
The nozzle paths were projected via ‘ spline ’ interpolation to obtain the desired trajectory and deposition velocity in the reference frame of the manipulator . 
In this study , the mixes consist of ordinary Portland cement , fine sand , chopped glass fibres ( 6 mm ) and chemical admixtures , which are used to print prismatic- and cubic-shaped specimens . 
Mechanical strength tests were performed on the printed specimens to evaluate the behaviour of the materials in the presence and absence of glass fibre . 
Robot end-effector velocity tests were performed to examine the printability and extrudability of the mortar mixes . 
The results show that printed specimens with glass fibre have enhanced compressive strength compared with specimens without glass fibre . 
Blends of raco-PP and amorphous PP show best 3D printing performances . 
Tailored polypropylene features enhanced interlayer bonding quality and reduced warpage . 
3D printed frog with PP as test sample demonstrates outstanding part performance . 
This paper reports on the optimization of polypropylene ( PP ) feedstock material towards extrusion-based additive manufacturing . 
To achieve this , two commercially available grades of polypropylene/ethylene random copolymers ( raco PP ) were modified , aiming to reduce warp deformation caused by shrinkage and at the same time reduce the anisotropic property by improving the interlayer bonding quality of 3D printed parts processed by fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) . 
A β-nucleating agent , several amorphous polypropylenes ( aPP ) and one linear low-density polyethylene ( LLDPE ) were selected as additive or blending component with the goal to reduce shrinkage . 
The polypropylene feedstock material optimization was conducted by a combination of a lab-scale filament rod processing method and utilizing printed square tubes to optimize printing performance . 
The achieved results demonstrate that the crystallization behavior and E-modulus of polypropylene play significant roles for warp deformation in extrusion-based 3D printed parts . 
The investigated polymer blend of raco PP and LLDPE shows no significant contribution to reduce warpage and impairs also the interlayer bonding . 
With two aPP grades warp deformation could be drastically reduced . 
In addition , the interlayer bonding quality is remarkably enhanced in these blends in spite of slight decreases in stiffness and strength . 
In conclusion , the optimized PP feedstock material features less warp deformation , high stiffness , and most importantly , outstanding interlayer bonding qualities . 
This paper investigates the effect of interlayer cooling on the mechanical properties of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS ) structures that are 3D printed using fusion based material extrusion . 
Two different types of samples were prepared , one designed to measure the compressive strength of the structural material , and the other designed to measure the shear strength of the structural material . 
As the wait time in between layers was increased , the effective yield strength was decreased for both types of samples . 
Temperature data was collected from the top layer of the structures after each successive layer deposition . 
This data revealed significant cooling over the wait times being considered . 
These trends prove that additional care needs to be taken when selecting the print settings for structural components that are manufactured using fused filament fabrication . 
This study shows that printing processes that require additional time ( i.e . 
larger parts , finer geometries , etc . ) 
will inherently lead to a reduction in the mechanical strength of the printed structure . 
To improve printing fidelity , reducing the slice thickness to eliminate the staircase effect is of great importance for digital light processing ( DLP ) technology . 
However , using a thinner slice printing model leads to a longer total printing time in the conventional DLP approach , which significantly reduces printing efficiency . 
In this work , a tunable pre-curing DLP approach was developed where the relationship between the forming layer thickness and ultraviolet ( UV ) exposure time is theoretically analyzed , and the curing process of photo-curable solutions is divided into two sub-processes : pre-curing and further curing . 
In the pre-curing process , the photo-curable solution is initially pre-cured and kept at the pre-gelled state due to continuous UV exposure during subsequent DLP printing . 
Then , the pre-cured photo-curable solution is quickly cured to form a designed thickness in each printing cycle . 
Also , the UV absorbing agent is added to the photo-curable hydrogel solutions to regulate the pre-curing process . 
Using a 10 μm slice for DLP printing , the total printing time of the tunable pre-curing DLP is approximately 5.6 % of the conventional DLP , and the staircase effect on the surface is significantly eliminated using 10 μm slice tunable pre-curing DLP approach , which leads to a better printing fidelity . 
Moreover , the reduction of UV exposure time and slice thickness is beneficial for cell viability during DLP bioprinting of thick bulk structures , which is demonstrated by the printing of PC12 cell-laden gelatin methacrylate ( GelMA ) bioinks . 
Using the tunable pre-curing DLP approach , the PC12 cells achieved higher cell viability ( 90.2 ± 6.1 % ) and better cell morphology than the conventional DLP approach ( 54.5 ± 4.8 % ) . 
The tunable pre-curing DLP approach provides a promising alternative to extend the application of DLP printing greatly . 
This paper proposes an electromagnetic based planar pressure sensor using a substrate integrated waveguide ( SIW ) . 
The proposed pressure sensor is inspired by a rectangular SIW cavity and is additively manufactured using 3D printed dielectric material with inkjet printed conductive pattern . 
We inserted meshed material at the SIW centre , to facilitate soft pressing , and simplify producing frequency shifts due to capacitive coupling perturbation from different pressure levels . 
This paper investigates the bending behaviors of a bi-material structure ( BMS ) using both experimental and numerical methods The BMS is a composite material built by a 3D-printed , open-cellular brittle plaster structure filled with a silicone elastomer . 
The composition and configuration of the two materials determine the overall mechanical properties . 
Four-point bending test results show a non-linear elastic property , enhanced strength and toughness of BMS samples compared to either material phase alone . 
Such behavior is believed to be a result of delayed microcrack propagation in the brittle phase and a hardening effect of elastomer . 
In the numerical study , finite element analysis ( FEA ) is employed to verify these hypotheses . 
The FEA incorporates a brittle cracking material model for the plaster and a hyperelastic model for the silicone . 
The brittle cracking model enables the estimation of element degradation as a result of crack development and thus eliminates the need for the extremely refined mesh . 
Simulation result confirms the non-linear elastic transition and crack-induced material degradation and visualizes the silicone strengthening mechanism that can avoid rapid structural rupture . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) is rapidly becoming one of the most popular manufacturing techniques for short run part production and rapid prototyping . 
AM encompasses a range of technologies , including powder bed fusion ( PBF ) process . 
The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and benchmark the mechanical performance of polyamide 12 ( PA12 ) parts , fabricated using a production scale powder bed fusion printing process ( HP Multi Jet Fusion printing process ) . 
This system has a build volume is 380 × 254 × 350 mm . 
The printed polymer parts were examined to determine their hydrophobicity , morphology , porosity and roughness . 
Chemical and thermal properties of the PA12 parts were also evaluated using attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy ( ATR FT-IR ) , x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) and differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) . 
The study highlights the influence of build orientation on the tensile ( ISO 527-1:2012 ) and flexural ( ISO 178:2010 ) properties . 
In terms of tensile strength , the parts exhibited isotropic behaviour with a maximum tensile strength of 49 MPa . 
In terms of flexural testing , the build orientations had a significant effect on the strength of the printed part . 
The Z orientation exhibited a 40 % higher flexural strength , when compared to that of the X orientation . 
The maximum flexural strength observed was 70 MPa . 
The results of this rapid , production scale AM study are compared with previous studies that detail the mechanical performance of PA12 , fabricated using PBF processes , such as selective laser sintering . 
Fab labs , which offer small-scale distributed digital fabrication , are forming a Green Fab Lab Network , which embraces concepts of an open source symbiotic economy and circular economy patterns . 
With the use of industrial 3D printers capable of fused particle fabrication/ fused granular fabrication ( FPF/FGF ) printing directly from waste plastic streams , green fab labs could act as defacto recycling centers for converting waste plastics into valuable products for their communities . 
Thus , in this study the Gigabot X , an open source industrial 3D printer , which has been shown to be amenable to a wide array of recyclables for FPF/FGF 3D printing , is used to evaluate this economic potential . 
An economic life cycle analysis of the technology is completed comprised of three cases studies using FPF for large sporting equipment products . 
Sensitivities are run on the electricity costs for operation , materials costs from various feed stocks and the capacity factors of the 3D printers . 
The results showed that FPF/FGF 3D printing is capable of energy efficient production of a wide range of large high-value sporting goods products . 
For the case study products analyzed even the lowest capacity factor ( starting only one print per week ) represented a profit when comparing to high-end value products . 
For some products the profit potential and return on investment was substantial ( e.g . 
The results clearly show that open source industrial FPF/FGF 3D printers have significant economic potential when used as a distributed recycling/manufacturing system using recyclable feed stocks in the green fab lab context . 
It is well-known that the effective mechanical properties of cellular structures can be tuned by varying its relative density . 
With the advancement of 3D printing , variable-density cellular structures can be fabricated with high precision using this emerging manufacturing technology . 
Taking advantage of this unique ability to fabricate variable-density cellular structure , an efficient homogenization-based topology optimization method for natural frequency optimization is presented in this work . 
The method is demonstrated using a cantilevered plate with a honeycomb structure and is validated by detailed finite element analysis and experiment . 
It is shown that the optimal design can be fabricated by 3D printing and shows significant enhancement in natural frequency and reduction in weight . 
Among additive manufacturing ( AM ) technologies , binder jetting ( BJ ) produces workpieces that could be used in a great variety of applications , such as decorative parts , prototypes , foundry molds , bone implants , and others . 
This technique includes the powder deposition to form the layers , binder application , and post-processing to enhance mechanical properties . 
Fibers can be mixed with traditional raw material powder in order to produce composite parts that are stronger . 
Sisal fibers are considered to be a promising reinforcement in composites because of their low cost , high strength , and lack of risk to human health . 
In Brazil , sisal fibers are abundant and there has been no previous study on the application of this fiber in binder jetting . 
This article proposes the production of gypsum–sisal fiber parts using BJ and the analysis of the effects of some manufacturing parameters , such as the presence of fiber , printing orientation , and post-processing . 
A material characterization is performed on raw materials and printed parts in the form of thermogravimetric analysis ( TGA ) , X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) . 
A complete 24 factorial design for analysis of variance was performed to evaluate the mechanical strength and porosity of the manufactured parts . 
It was observed that the fibers had a positive influence on the mechanical strength of the infiltrated parts , but a loss of strength was verified on the green parts . 
The reason for a loss of mechanical strength correlated with the increase in porosity caused by the fiber during the printing process ; however , this increased porosity contributed to a more efficient infiltration post-processing . 
We experimentally and numerically investigate elastic wave propagation in a class of lightweight architected materials composed of hollow spheres and binders . 
Elastic wave transmission tests demonstrate the existence of vibration mitigation capability in the proposed architected foams , which is validated against the numerically predicted phononic band gap . 
We further describe that the phononic band gap properties can be significantly altered through changing hollow sphere thickness and binder size in the architected foams . 
At the threshold stiffness contrast of 50 , the proposed architected foam requires only a volume fraction of 10.8 % while exhibiting an omnidirectional band gap size exceeding 130 % . 
The proposed design paradigm and physical mechanisms are robust and applicable to architected foams with other topologies , thus providing new opportunities to design phononic metamaterials for low-frequency vibration control . 
Additive manufacturing of polymer derived ceramics with fused filament fabrication . 
Producing ceramics with hollow struts by surface coating with preceramic polymers . 
Creating a multi-level porous system with stable geometry . 
All 3-D printing materials produced ceramics skins of less than 100 microns . 
A promising method for obtaining ceramic components with additive manufacturing ( AM ) is to use a two-step process of first printing the artifact in polymer and then converting it to ceramic using pyrolysis to form polymer derived ceramics ( PDCs ) . 
AM of ceramic components using PDCs has been demonstrated with a number of high-cost techniques , but data is lacking for fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) -based 3-D printing . 
This study investigates the potential of lower-cost , more widespread and accessible FFF-based 3-D printing of PDCs . 
Low-cost FFF machines have a resolution limit set by the nozzle width , which is inferior to the resolutions obtained with expensive stereolithography or selective laser sintering AM systems . 
However , to match the performance a partial PDC conversion is used here , where only the outer surface of the printed polymer frame is converted to ceramic . 
Here the FFF-based 3-D printed sample is coated with a preceramic polymer and then it is converted into the corresponding PDC sample with a high temperature pyrolysis process . 
A screening experiment is performed on commercial filaments to obtain ceramic 3-D prints by surface coating both hard thermoplastics : poly lactic acid ( PLA ) , polycarbonate ( PC ) , nylon alloys , polypropylene ( PP ) , polyethylene terephthalate glycol ( PETG ) , polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ) , and co-polyesters ; and flexible materials including : flexible PLA , thermoplastic elastomer and thermoplastic polyurethane filaments . 
Mass and volume changes were quantified for the soaking and pyrolysis steps to form a hollow ceramic skin . 
All 3-D printing materials extruded at 250 microns successfully produced hollow ceramics skins of less than 100 microns . 
The novel results developed here can be used to choose FFF-based polymers to use for PDC processing on a wide range of applications such as heat exchangers , heat sinks , scaffoldings for bone tissue growth , chemical/ gas filters and custom scientific hardware . 
Additive manufacturing via 3-D printing technologies have become a frontier in materials research , including its application in the development and recycling of permanent magnets . 
This work addresses the opportunity to integrate magnetic field sources into 3-D printing process in order to enable printing , alignment of anisotropic permanent magnets or magnetizing of magnetic filler materials , without requiring further processing . 
A non-axisymmetric electromagnet-type field source architecture was designed , modelled , constructed , installed to a fused filament commercial 3-D printer , and tested . 
The testing was performed by applying magnetic field while printing composite anisotropic Nd-Fe-B + Sm-Fe-N powders bonded in Nylon12 ( 65 vol. 
% ) and recycled Sm-Co powder bonded in PLA ( 15 vol. 
% ) . 
Magnetic characterization indicated that the degree-of-alignment of the magnet powders increased both with alignment field strength ( controlled by the electric current applied to the magnetizing system ) and the printing temperature . 
Both coercivity and remanence were found to be strongly dependent on the degree-of-alignment , except for printing performed below but near the Curie temperature of Nd-Fe-B ( 310 ° C ) . 
The variations in coercivity were consistent with previous observations in bonded magnet materials . 
This work verifies that integration of magnetic field sources into 3-D printing processes will result in magnetic alignment of particles while ensuring that other advantages of 3-D printing are retained . 
Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) is the most popular additive manufacturing method because of its numerous capabilities and relatively low cost . 
This comes with a trade off as FFF printed parts are typically weak in the layer deposition direction due to insufficient interlayer bonding . 
This research adopts the method of cold plasma treatment and investigates the potential enhancement of interlayer bonding by altering the printed surface prior to the deposition of the next layer . 
Polylactic acid ( PLA ) is used as the printing material , due to its ubiquity in industry . 
The bonding strength is measured by the shear bond strength test . 
The results show that bond strength improved over 100 % with 30 s of treatment and over 50 % with 300 s of treatment . 
This indicates that wettability may not be the dominant mechanism for enhanced bonding after treatment . 
Using 3D printed , patient-specific medical phantoms has become increasingly popular for use in biomedical applications including medical device testing , medical education , and surgical planning , etc . 
To overcome the inherent differences in mechanical properties between biological tissues and printable polymers , metamaterials are being introduced to mimic the mechanical response of the biological tissues . 
However , the existing trial-and-error approaches for finding the geometric parameters of the metamaterial result in time-consuming trials , which can not meet the urgent needs for medical applications . 
We addressed this issue by proposing an optimization-based statistical approach with an easy-to-evaluate surrogate model to guide the design process and reduce the design time . 
In this paper , several validation tests were reported , including a biomedical application of mimicking the mechanical response of human articular cartilage . 
The proposed approach achieves excellent accuracy both visually and quantitatively . 
This data-driven approach demonstrates efficacy and flexibility in building the surrogate model even when no obvious physical trends can be extracted . 
With the proposed statistical approach , we can efficiently design the metamaterial and 3D-print mechanically accurate phantoms for sophisticated engineering applications . 
Cartilage regeneration is challenging because of the poor intrinsic self-repair capacity of avascular tissue . 
Three-dimensional ( 3D ) bioprinting has gained significant attention in the field of tissue engineering and is a promising technology to overcome current difficulties in cartilage regeneration . 
Although bioink is an essential component of bioprinting technology , several challenges remain in satisfying different requirements for ideal bioink , including biocompatibility and printability based on specific biological requirements . 
Gelatin and hyaluronic acid ( HA ) have been shown to be ideal biomimetic hydrogel sources for cartilage regeneration . 
However , controlling their structure , mechanical properties , biocompatibility , and degradation rate for cartilage repair remains a challenge . 
Here , we show a photocurable bioink created by hybridization of gelatin methacryloyl ( GelMA ) and glycidyl-methacrylated HA ( GMHA ) for material extrusion 3D bioprinting in cartilage regeneration . 
GelMA and GMHA were mixed in various ratios , and the mixture of 7 % GelMA and 5 % GMHA bioink ( G7H5 ) demonstrated the most reliable mechanical properties , rheological properties , and printability . 
This bioink also provided an excellent microenvironment for chondrogenesis of tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( TMSCs ) in vitro and in vivo . 
In summary , this study presents the ideal formulation of GelMA/GMHA hybrid bioink to generate a well-suited photocurable bioink for cartilage regeneration of TMSCs using a material extrusion bioprinter , and could be applied to cartilage tissue engineering . 
Fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) is one of the most popular additive manufacturing processes . 
However , structural applications of FFF are still limited by unwanted variations in mechanical strength and structural dimensions of printed parts . 
The samples were prepared by a low-cost open-source FFF 3D printer , and full three-dimensional ( 3D ) geometrical characterizations were performed on them using X-ray micro computed tomography ( micro-CT ) . 
The results showed significant geometry variation depending on different printing conditions , including print speed , layer height , and nozzle temperature . 
Based on the results , we demonstrated the effects of reducing layer height and increasing nozzle temperature as well as compensating material extrusion rate to improve geometric precision with minimum 0.8 % deviation . 
Moreover , uniaxial tensile and Mode III tear tests results showed that there are linear relations between bonding zone geometry and bonding strength . 
In addition , from the 3D geometry of the resulting printed part , we could estimate the Young ’ s modulus in the extrudate stacking direction using finite element method , which showed good agreement with the measured value . 
Our experimental data may also serve as benchmark data for future multi-physics simulation models . 
The process simulation tool Additive3D has been developed in Abaqus© 2017 to model the Extrusion Deposition Additive Manufacturing ( EDAM ) process for fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites . 
This additive manufacturing ( AM ) method encompasses material deposition processes where geometries are constructed layer by layer and the resulting layer properties are highly anisotropic.The goal is to predict final deformed shapes and residual stresses of printed geometries due to the printing process and the material anisotropy . 
The resulting design tool allows to assess the outcomes of the printing process based on the part geometry , the printing material and the position control parameters.Material properties were characterized , and validation experiments , without additional calibration , show an excellent agreement between modeled and measured part deformation states with relative deviations below 7 % . 
Due to the physics-based nature of the developed simulation tools , the simulations can be extended to account for different part scales , printing materials and printing histories . 
Binder jet printing is one additive manufacturing technique utilized in today ’ s industry that uses an adhesive to bind powders together selectively in a bed . 
Post-printing processes are necessary for binder jet printed parts to increase key properties in materials such as density , but the full effects of this post-processing are not yet well understood . 
This study aims to enhance the understanding of how the process of sintering can affect the density evolution of a Ti-6Al-4 V binder jet printed part . 
Results show that the density is lower at the edges of the part and higher in regions of significant topological curvature , likely due to variations originating from the printing process that are propagated . 
These printing process effects can be due to binder- or powder-related occurrences , which are described in relation to the obtained results . 
Binder effects include high-velocity impact , particle disruption , and excessive spreading . 
Powder effects include printhead and recoater speed , satellite particles , and changing pressure throughout the powder bed . 
These factors affected the coordination number of particles in the green part , and caused sintering to progress more slowly in certain areas . 
In large area pellet extrusion additive manufacturing , the temperature of the substrate just before the deposition of a new subsequent layer affects the overall structure of the part . 
Warping and cracking occur if the substrate temperature is below a material-specific threshold , and deformation and deposition adhesion failure occur if the substrate temperature is above a different threshold . 
Currently , Big Area Additive Manufacturing ( BAAM ) machine users mitigate this problem by trial and error , which is costly and may result in decreased mechanical properties , monetary losses and time inefficiencies . 
Through thermal imaging , the range of temperatures present during the printing of a 20 wt . 
% carbon fiber reinforced acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS-20CF ) single-bead vertical wall via the BAAM machine was measured . 
Compression tests were performed to understand the material behavior at those temperatures . 
Optical imaging was performed to identify a relationship between porosity in the printed bead and plateau regions in the compression curves at temperatures of 170 °C and below . 
From the thermal imaging and compressive testing , it was concluded that if the substrate temperature is above 200 °C , it will not be able to withstand the load exerted by the deposition of a new layer without experiencing deformation . 
This behavior was attributed to the experimentally obtained low compressive strength of ABS-20CF observed at temperatures above 200 °C . 
Taking advantage of an extended design and manufacturing space for composites , the technology of fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) of continuous fibre-reinforced thermoplastics shows great potential for the production of the next generation of lightweight structural parts . 
This process still has room for development . 
Moreover , knowledge of the mechanical behaviour of the resulting 3D printed composites is still limited . 
In this work , the intra- and inter-laminar behaviours of carbon fibre/polyamide printed laminates were extensively characterised to determine ply elastic and strength properties , as well as interface strength and fracture characteristics . 
Moreover , the effects of eventual production defects on these properties were analysed , putting in evidence some of the present shortcomings of the FFF process . 
Such defects include non-homogeneous fibre distribution , large amounts of intra- and interlaminar voids , and weak interlayer bonding , which are likely to be due to insufficient thermo-mechanical consolidation of the material during the FFF process , and have significant influence on the matrix-dominated mechanical properties . 
As a result , the transverse and interlaminar properties were found to be lower than those obtained through hot compression moulding of carbon fibre/polyamide laminates . 
Besides highlighting possible process improvements , the mechanical characterisation carried out in this work promises a significant contribution to the abilities of designing and simulating general 3D printed composite parts . 
The most common method for Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) of polymers is melt extrusion , which normally requires several pre-processing steps to compound and extrude filament feedstock , resulting in an overall long melt residency time . 
Consequently a typical melt extrusion-based AM process is time/cost consuming , and limited in the availability of materials that can be processed . 
Polyvinyl alcohol ( PVOH ) is one of the heat-sensitive polymers demonstrating a thermal decomposition temperature overlapping its processing window . 
This study proposed to use a pellet-fed material extrusion technique to directly process PVOH granules without the necessity of using any pre-processing steps . 
The approach essentially combined compounding , extrusion and AM , allowing multi-material printing with minimum exposure to heat during the process . 
The processing parameters were determined via thermal and rheological characterisation of PVOH . 
Effects of processing temperature and time on the thermal decomposition of PVOH were demonstrated , which further affected the tensile properties and solubility . 
The pellet-fed material extrusion technology demonstrated good 3D printability , multi-material printing capability , and great versatility in processing polymer melts . 
In this paper , we investigate the print orientation effects on the macrostructure , the mechanical and thermal properties , and the strain field behavior of ULTEM® 9085 using a Stratasys Fused deposition modeling ( FDM ) 400 Printer . 
The tensile strength , failure strain , Poisson ’ s ratio , coefficient of thermal expansion and modulus were all shown to vary significantly depending on the build orientation of identical dogbones . 
FDM parts ranged in strength from 46 to 85 % of strengths attainable from comparable injection-molded parts . 
The coefficient of variation ( CV ) increased from 2 to 13 % as the primary layer orientation deviated from the primary load direction . 
CAT scan and SEM were employed to relate the corresponding macrostructure to the mechanical response of the material along the parts ’ 3-primary directions , using digital image correlation ( DIC ) . 
The fracture surfaces of these parts further suggest that 3D FDM materials behave more like laminated composite structures than isotropic cast resins and therefore design allowables should reflect actual part build configurations . 
One of the main benefits of material extrusion additive manufacturing , also known as fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) or 3D printing , is the flexibility in terms of printing materials . 
Locally reinforced components can be easily produced by selectively combining reinforced with unfilled tough thermoplastics . 
However , such multi-material composites usually lack sufficient weld strength in order to be able to withstand operation loads . 
The present study attempts to close this gap by characterising the cohesion between the strands of two materials with different stiffness , namely neat PLA and short carbon fibre reinforced PLA ( CF-PLA ) , produced by FFF using advanced fracture mechanical techniques . 
The full set of engineering constants of both materials were obtained under the assumption of transverse isotropy from tensile tests in combination with digital image correlation . 
Both tests were in good correlation with each other and revealed that the interlayer PLA/CF-PLA bonding was at least as tough as the interlayer CF-PLA/CF-PLA bonding . 
In this work , systematic studies were carried out on SLS ( selective laser sintering ) printed samples , with two different geometries , standard test samples dumb-bells ( dog bones ) and tubes ( Ø 30 mm and 150 mm long ) , consisting of two different materials , viz . 
PA12 ( polyamide ) with and without the addition of carbon fibres ( CFs ) . 
These samples were tested according to their respective ISO standards . 
The standard test samples exhibited relatively small differences with regards to printing directions when PA12 was used alone . 
Their tensile strengths ( σm ) were approx . 
75 % –80 % of the injection-moulded sample . 
The addition of carbon fibres significantly enhanced the tensile strengths , namely 50 % greater for the vertically printed test sample and more than 100 % greater for the horizontally printed samples , compared to the respective objects consisting of PA12 alone . 
The strong difference in printing directions can be attributed to the orientation of the carbon fibres . 
Mechanical tests on the SLS printed tubes confirmed the trends that were found in the standard test samples . 
Porosity and pore structure inside the SLS printed tubes were studied by combining optical microscopy and X-ray microtomography with image analysis . 
It was found that porosity was a general phenomenon inside the SLS printed samples . 
Nevertheless , there were significant differences in porosity , which probably depended on the properties of the materials used , both with and without carbon fibres , thus causing significant differences in light absorption and heat conductivity . 
The printed samples made of PA12 alone possessed quite a high level of porosity ( 4.7 % ) , of which the size of the biggest pore was hundreds of microns . 
The twenty biggest pores with an average size of 75*104 μ m3 accounted for 43 % of the total porosity . 
However , the porosity of the printed samples made from PA12 + CF was only 0.68 % , with the biggest pore being only tens of microns . 
The corresponding average pore size of the 20 biggest pores was 72*103 μ m3 , which was one order of magnitude smaller than the printed samples made from PA12 alone . 
Pores inside the SLS printed samples were probably responsible for a spread in the mechanical properties measured , e.g . 
tensile strengths , tensile ( Young ’ s ) modulus , strain at break , etc . 
The ratios of their standard deviations to their corresponding mean values in the standard test samples could probably be used as an indicator of porosity , i.e . 
An integrated wearable 3-D printable microfluidic pump was developed , which uses a novel actuation process . 
Fused deposition manufacture 3-D printing was used as a means to accurately produce this device . 
This resulted in the fabrication of high precision integrated parts made from poly-lactic-acid bioplastic . 
By integrating an electro-magnetically actuated closed diffuser nozzle pump configuration a micro-fabricated microfluidic pump has been produced . 
Biofluids have been driven through the device by actuating a composite polydimethylsiloxane diaphragm actuated polymeric microstructure diaphragm membrane using electromagnetic force . 
This composite diaphragm was made by suspending 10 μm iron particles in the polydimethylsiloxane at concentrations of 30 % , 40 % and 50 % . 
It is shown that this device acts as an effective electromagnetic force actuated a pump . 
The integration of 3D printed devices to form a micropump is proven through practical testing which demonstrate a controllable flow rate was generated . 
The Bladder Assisted Composite Manufacturing ( BACM ) technique allows fabrication of complex hollow composite geometries . 
However , traditional bladder manufacturing methods require multiple steps and a master geometry which increases the cost and the manufacturing time . 
Hence , additively manufactured bladders are presented as an alternative solution to bladders manufactured through traditional methods . 
The use of printed bladders is demonstrated by consolidating and curing a composite part made out of an aerospace grade composite prepreg material , IM7/8552 . 
Bladders are additively manufactured using the Fused Deposition Modeling ( FDM ) technique with Thermoplastic Polyurethane ( TPU ) . 
Based on the results of a thermomechanical investigation of the TPU , a two-step curing cycle for manufacturing a composite part with IM7/8552 prepreg was designed . 
The part consolidation achieved with this method was characterized by measuring void content and comparing it to the void content in a sample cured in a standard autoclave process . 
The low void content achieved with the BACM method demonstrated the potential of this technology for providing bladders for short production runs or prototyping . 
As more manufacturing processes and research institutions adopt customized manufacturing as a key element in their design strategies and finished products , the resulting mechanical properties of parts produced through additive manufacturing ( AM ) must be characterized and understood . 
In polymer extrusion ( PE ) , the most recently extruded polymer filament must bond to the previously extruded filament via polymer diffusion to form a “ weld ” . 
The strength of the weld limits the performance of the manufactured part and is controlled through processing conditions . 
Understanding the role of processing conditions , specifically extruder velocity and extruder temperature , on the overall strength of the weld will allow optimization of PE-AM parts . 
Here , the fracture toughness of a single weld is determined through a facile “ trouser tear ” Mode III fracture experiment . 
The actual weld thickness is observed directly by optical microscopy ( OM ) characterization of cross sections of PE-AM samples . 
Representative data of weld strength as a function of printing parameters on a commercial 3D printer demonstrates the robustness of the method . 
Digital light processing technology ( DLP ) is an effective additive manufacturing method to fabricate ceramic components with high precision and complicated structure . 
Here , a novel strategy to prepare chopped carbon fibers ( Cf ) /SiC ceramic composites through stereolithography Cf combined with liquid silicon infiltration is presented . 
The 3D-architectured bodies possessed high printing stableness and accuracy with the forming deviation of less than 5 % . 
Moreover , the tightly bonded adjacent layers can contribute to the synergistic effect from curing adhesion of photosensitive resin and crisscrossed pinning of chopped carbon fibers . 
As-prepared components after liquid silicon infiltration were dense and exhibited maximum flexural strength of 262.6 MPa . 
This strategy demonstrates a promising prospect and tantalizing possibility to fabricate SiC ceramic composites with complex shapes and structures . 
Successful 3D printing of metatsable high entropy alloy Fe40Mn20Co20Cr15Si5 ( CS-HEA ) is acheived . 
CS-HEA demonstrated Excellent printability due to very low defect denisty . 
High entropy alloys ( HEAs ) have attracted scientific interest due to their good mechanical properties and failure resistance , whereas additive manufacturing ( AM ) has emerged as a powerful yet flexible processing route for advanced materials . 
However , limitations inherent in both these fields include HEAs display inferior mechanical properties in as cast condition ; and AM demands expansion of printable alloys . 
dominated microstructure after laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing has been evaluated . 
As-printed CS-HEA showed higher strength due to high work hardenability , whereas substantial uniform ductility is associated with a combination of transformation and twinning induced plasticity during deformation . 
Additionally , very low volume percent of voids ( ∼0.1 % ) along with high strength-ductility shows excellent printability of the CS-HEA using laser-based additive manufacturing . 
Izod impact test specimens were fabricated via a desktop grade material extrusion 3D printer process using ABS in four build orientations . 
The 3D printed impact test specimens were examined in order to compare the effect of stress concentrator fabrication on impact test data where two methods were used to fabricate the stress concentrating notch : ( 1 ) printing the stress concentrator ; and ( 2 ) machining the stress concentrator where the dimensions of the notch matched those specified in the ASTM standard D256-10 . 
In both test cases , sensitivity to build orientation was also observed . 
The sample sets with printed stress concentrators were found to be statistically similar to their counterparts with milled stress concentrators . 
The experiment was repeated again on a commercial grade material extrusion 3D printer using ABS , PC , PC-ABS , and Ultem 9085 and differences in impact test results were observed most notably when Ultem 9085 was tested . 
Scanning electron microscopy was utilized to perform fractograpy on impact test specimens to explore the effect of stress concentrator fabrication on the fracture surface morphology of the failed specimens . 
The work here demonstrates the need for materials testing standards that are specific to additive manufacturing technologies ; as well as concluding that all-printed impact test specimens may offer the best representation of the impact characteristics of 3D printed structures . 
In recent years 3D printing has gained popularity amongst industry professionals and hobbyists alike , with many new types of Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) apparatus types becoming available on the market . 
A massively overlooked component of FFF is the requirement for a simple method to calculate the geometries of polymer depositions extruded during the FFF process . 
Manufacturers have so far achieved adequate methods to calculate tool-paths through so called slicer software packages which calculate the required velocities of extrusion from prior knowledge and data . 
Presented here is a method for obtaining a series of equations for predicting height , width and cross-sectional area values for given processing parameters within the FFF process for initial laydown on to a glass surface . 
This work investigates the evolution of the tensile and structural properties of fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) , formed polymers under gamma irradiation . 
Commercial off-the-shelf print filaments of Poly ( lactic acid ) ( PLA ) , Thermoplastic polyurethane ( TPU ) , Chlorinated polyethylene elastomer ( CPE ) , Nylon , Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS ) and Polycarbonate ( PC ) were exposed to gamma-ray doses of up to 5.3 MGy . 
The suitability of FFF-formed components made from these materials for use in radiation environments is evaluated by considering their structural properties . 
We identify clear trends in the structural properties of all the materials tested and correlate them with changes in the chemical structure . 
We find that Nylon shows the best performance under these conditions , with no change in ultimate tensile strength and an increase in stiffness . 
However , some of our findings suggest that the effect of additives to this type of filament may result in potentially undesirable adhesive properties . 
The organic polymer PLA was notably more radiation-sensitive than the other materials tested , showing 50 % decrease in Young ’ s Modulus and ultimate tensile strength at order of magnitude lower radiation dose . 
A mechanism is proposed whereby FFF-processed components would have substantially different radiation tolerances than bulk material . 
In this article , we report the synthesis of a series of multi-branched benzylidene ( BI ) ketone-based photo-initiators for two-photon polymerisation based 3D printing/additive manufacturing . 
The successful fabrication of complex 3D structures at high writing speeds ( up to 100 mm/s ) indicated that the four-branched initiator 4-BI could potentially increase the fabrication efficiency and hence become a promising initiator for two-photon polymerisation . 
A path planning methodology is proposed for FFF based on stress orientations . 
Specimens created with the stress-based path exhibit better mechanical properties . 
Anisotropy of tool-paths leads to stress redistribution of stress components . 
Different tool-paths are broken with variable fracture processes and surfaces . 
Tool-path planning has a considerable impact on the quality of components printed by fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) . 
This research proposes a path generation strategy based on the orientations of the maximum principal stresses . 
According to stress calculations from finite element analysis ( FEA ) of the components , tool-paths , which are programmed as parallel to the maximum principal stress directions , are constructed with the depth-first search ( DFS ) method and a connection criterion . 
The Dijkstra algorithm is engaged to reduce the nozzle jump distance and shorten the production time . 
Stretching tests of different specimens printed with the developed path generation algorithms demonstrate that the model with the stress-based path has better mechanical performance . 
The digital image correlation ( DIC ) method and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) are employed to observe the fracture processes and fracture surfaces , respectively . 
Corresponding results of DIC and SEM reveal that different path filling forms exhibit variable failure patterns because of filament anisotropy . 
The filling fraction is calculated and indicates that the deposition quality of the advanced path is not compromised . 
This work provides a synthesis methodology for improving the mechanical performance of 3D printing products . 
In the context of the large format additive manufacturing in ambient conditions , extrusion materials need to be thermally stable , thus short fiber-reinforced composites have been developed to tailor the thermal behavior . 
However , lack of public knowledge in material properties and dataset lead to improper processing ; yielding degradation of materials during trial & error operations which not only increase cost but also reduce the quality of printed parts . 
This research investigated neat and composite ABS filled with short carbon fiber ( ABS/CF ) and glass fiber ( ABS/GF ) using thermophysical and thermomechanical characterization techniques to generate dataset and knowledge that can be used to process materials without degrading the properties as well as achieving the quality parts in future . 
Thermogravimetric analysis was performed to study the degradation behavior . 
Differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) analyzed the glass transition temperature ( Tg ) and specific heat to understand the heat dissipation of neat and composite materials . 
While the Tg measured in DSC was not significantly different , the dynamic mechanical analysis showed that Tg in ABS/CF was increased due to the impeded polymer chain mobility . 
The thermomechanical analysis described the deformation behavior before and after the transition temperature which suggested that ABS/CF has the highest thermal stability to retain the shape at elevated temperature followed by ABS/GF and neat ABS . 
The findings of this article can be used during the modeling of pellet-fed large format AM and developing empirical process parameters . 
The use of additive manufacturing ( AM ) is rapidly expanding in many industries mostly because of the flexibility to manufacture complex geometries . 
Recently , a family of technologies that produce fiber reinforced components has been introduced , widening the options available to designers . 
AM fiber reinforced composites are characterized by the fact that process related parameters such as the amount of reinforcement fiber , or printing architecture , significantly affect the tensile properties of final parts . 
To find optimal structures using new AM technologies , guidelines for the design of 3D printed composite parts are needed . 
This paper presents an evaluation of the effects that different geometric parameters have on the tensile properties of 3D printed composites manufactured by fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) out of continuous and chopped carbon fiber reinforcement . 
Parameters such as infill density and infill patterns of chopped composite material , as well as fiber volume fraction and printing architecture of continuous fiber reinforcement ( CFR ) composites are varied . 
The effect of the location of the initial deposit point of reinforcement fibers on the tensile properties of the test specimens is studied . 
Also , the effect that the fiber deposition pattern has on tensile performance is quantified . 
Considering the geometric parameters that were studied , a variation of the Rule of Mixtures ( ROM ) that provides a way to estimate the elastic modulus of a 3D printed composite is proposed . 
Findings may be used by designers to define the best construction parameters for 3D printed composite parts . 
The application space for three-dimensional ( 3D ) printing , such as fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) , has grown significantly through the use of high-performance composite materials . 
While the mechanical , thermal , optical , and electrical properties of additive manufacturing ( AM ) polymer composites are being actively studied , the magnetic properties of AM parts have seen much less attention . 
Prior research has shown that the structural print settings for FFF influence the magnetic properties of the printed part ( Bollig et al. 
, 2017 ) . 
However , the structural hierarchy present in the FFF process complicates a simple analysis of how these magnetic differences arise . 
Here , a magnetic filament consisting of polylactic acid ( PLA ) polymer and 40 wt. 
% iron was used to print a variety of samples to investigate how the macroscopic sample shape and the mesoscopic infill orientation and infill percentage affects the magnetic properties . 
The array of samples systematically covered different aspect ratios ( length : width ) , edge contours ( rectangular vs. ellipsoidal ) , two infill orientations ( long axis alignment vs. short axis alignment ) , and varying infill percentages . 
The key results show that the highest magnetic susceptibility was seen for magnetic fields applied parallel to the infill orientation . 
The macroscopic geometry increased the magnetic susceptibility parallel to the long axis of the sample . 
Lastly , certain factors , such as edge contours and infill percentage , only affected the magnetic susceptibility when the magnetic field was applied transverse to the infill orientation , but had no effect when field was applied along the infill direction . 
Elucidating how the part shape , infill orientation , and infill percentage affects the magnetic properties of AM parts will help the community better understand how an FFF process can be utilized to make optimal magnetic components , such as transformer cores , electric motors , and electromagnetic interference shielding . 
The interface between layers has bulk-material strength . 
Filament-scale grooves reduce load-bearing capacity at the interface . 
Toughness and strain-at-fracture are higher in the direction of extruded filaments . 
Aspect ratio has an important effect on load-bearing capacity . 
Strain-localisation is a predominant cause of fracture , based on simulation . 
This study demonstrates that the interface between layers in 3D-printed polylactide has strength of the bulk filament . 
Specially designed 3D-printed tensile specimens were developed to test mechanical properties in the direction of the extruded filament ( F specimens ) , representing bulk material properties , and normal to the interface between 3D-printed layers ( Z specimens ) . 
A wide range of cross-sectional aspect ratios for extruded-filament geometries were considered by printing with five different LHs and five different EFWs . 
Both F and Z specimens demonstrated bulk material strength . 
In contrast , strain-at-fracture , specific load-bearing capacity , and toughness were found to be lower in Z specimens due to the presence of filament-scale geometric features ( grooves between extruded filaments ) . 
The different trends for strength as compared to other mechanical properties were evaluated with finite-element analysis . 
It was found that anisotropy was caused by the extruded-filament geometry and localised strain ( as opposed to assumed incomplete bonding of the polymer across the interlayer interface ) . 
Additionally , effects of variation in print speed and layer time were studied and found to have no influence on interlayer bond strength . 
The relevance of the results to other materials , toolpath design , industrial applications , and future research is discussed . 
Multi-photon polymerization , like the so-called direct laser writing ( DLW ) technique allows for flexible additive manufacturing of three-dimensional ultra-precise structures on the micro- and nanoscale . 
A possible application for DLW is the manufacturing of measurement standards for calibration procedures of optical measurement instruments . 
This requires flexible and high precision manufacturing of individualized geometries with high quality surfaces . 
However , many of the process parameters in DLW have to be selected based on experience and previous knowledge.In this article , the influence of DLW process parameters on the micro-geometry and surface roughness produced are systematically studied , and optimized in terms of printing speed and manufacturing accuracy . 
Resulting microstructures are being evaluated with different measurement techniques , i.e. 
, a stylus instrument , SEM and AFM . 
Based on optimized process parameters , a new measurement standard for the novel interferometric measurement instrument Ellipso-Height-Topometer is manufactured and examined as a case study . 
As a result , it can be shown , that DLW is able to manufacture ultra-precise micro geometries in a very flexible and very fast way and satisfies the tolerances for manufacturing of the designed measurement standard . 
The spreading of molten polymer between the moving printing head and the substrate in extrusion additive manufacturing is studied . 
Finite element computation and an analytical model have been used . 
The hypotheses of the analytical model are qualitatively justified by the results of the numerical computation . 
The analytical calculation is a powerful tool to rapidly evaluate the relationships between processing parameters ( extrusion rate , printing head velocity , gap between the printing head and the substrate ) and some characteristics of the deposition ( dimensions of the deposited filament , pressure at the printing head nozzle , separating force between substrate and printing head ) . 
An isothermal hypothesis is discussed . 
The viscous non-Newtonian behavior is accounted for through an approximate shear thinning power law model . 
A printing processing window is defined following several requirements : a continuous deposit , without spreading in front of the printing head , maximum and minimum spreading pressures , an upper-limit for the separating force between head and substrate . 
A heated build environment in Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) additive manufacturing ( AM ) is used to promote layer bonding in printed parts and reduce the difference in temperature between the extrusion and environment decreasing the shrinkage , residual stresses , and part deformation . 
A build environment capable of maintaining a high-temperature ( > 200 °C ) is often required to enable high-quality FFF printing of high-glass-transition , high-performance polymers such as nylon , PPSF , and ULTEM . 
Industrial-scale AM systems are capable of printing such polymers , as they offer a controlled , high-temperature printing environment ; however , the machine cost often exceeds > $ 100,000 . 
Many of these printers use bed heating rather than controlled environment heating , which can lead to inhomogeneous heat transfer and inconsistent properties . 
The key barrier to offering high-temperature environments for desktop-scale FFF systems in a cost-effective manner is that the electrical components must be compatible with , protected from , or removed from environments exceeding 100 °C.To enable desktop-scale FFF printing of high-performance polymers at a low cost and high quality , the authors present a novel inverted FFF system design that provides a build environment of up to 400 °C . 
The inverted configuration effectively isolates the system electronics from the heated build environment , which allows for the use of inexpensive components . 
In this paper , the authors verify the inverted design concept analytically via a computational fluid dynamics model . 
The concept is then experimentally validated via a comparison of the strength of PPSF components printed on the inverted desktop-scale FFF system . 
Additively manufactured parts made with polymer extrusion techniques can be 50–75 % weaker in the z-direction ( across layers ) than in the x- and y-directions . 
This is particularly a challenge when printing large-scale parts , such as with the Big Area Additive Manufacturing ( BAAM ) system , because layer times can exceed several minutes . 
The current work presents a method for controlling the temperature of the substrate material on the BAAM just prior to deposition using infrared heating lamps . 
Long layer times were also simulated by actively cooling the material following deposition of each layer . 
The effect of substrate temperature on the z-direction mechanical properties of 20 % carbon fiber reinforced acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS ) was measured for an initial temperature ranging from 50 °C to 150 °C and a preheated temperature ranging from 150 °C to 220 °C . 
Infrared preheating proved to be very effective when applied to substrates that had cooled considerably , almost doubling the tensile strength and increasing the fracture toughness by a factor of 7x . 
Poly-l-lactic acid ( PLLA ) is a bioresorbable polymer used in a variety of biomedical applications . 
Many 3D printers employ the fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) approach with the ubiquitous low-cost poly-lactic acid ( PLA ) fiber . 
However , use of the FFF approach to fabricate scaffolds with medical grade PLLA polymer remains largely unexplored . 
In this study , high molecular weight PL-32 pellets were extruded into ∼1.7 mm diameter PLLA fiber . 
Melt rheometric data of the PLLA polymer was analyzed and demonstrated pseudo-plastic behavior with a flow index of n = 0.465 ( < 1 ) . 
Differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) was conducted using samples from the extruded fiber to obtain thermal properties . 
DSC of the 3D printed struts was also analyzed to assess changes in thermal properties due to FFF . 
The DSC and rheometric analysis results were subsequently used to define appropriate FFF process parameters . 
Constant porosity scaffolds were FFF 3D printed with 4 distinct laydown patterns ; 0/90° rectilinear ( control ) , 45/135° rectilinear , Archimedean chords , and honeycomb using the in-house developed custom multi-modality 3D bioprinter ( CMMB ) . 
The effect of laydown pattern on scaffold bulk erosion ( weight loss ) was studied by immersion in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) over a 6-month period and measured monthly . 
Cross-sectional scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) images of the 6-month degraded scaffolds showed noticeable structural deterioration . 
The study demonstrates successful processing of PLLA fiber from PL-32 pellets and FFF-based 3D printing of bioresorbable scaffolds with pre-defined laydown patterns using medical grade PLLA polymer which could prove beneficial in biomedical applications .

The hybrid composite structure ( rGO/SiCN ) shows high strength and electrical conductivity . 
Steady graphene oxide ( GO ) scaffolds created by direct ink writing are used to develop a silicon carbonitride ( SiCN ) -graphene oxide hybrid material through a preceramic polymer route . 
For achieving mechanically stable GO scaffolds , the drying method is critical as the ink contains about 5 wt. 
% of GO , 10 wt. 
% of polyelectrolytes and 85 wt. 
% of water . 
The liquid preceramic polymer ( polysilazane type ) quickly infiltrates the 3D scaffolds , under vacuum conditions , entirely covering the GO network creating a replica of the original scaffold . 
The hybrid cellular structure -once thermally treated for GO reduction and ceramic conversion- consists of a network of reduced GO ( ∼10 wt. 
% ) embedded in an amorphous SiCN matrix following the designed architecture . 
The 3D hybrid structures show notable electrical conductivity ( 890 S m−1 at room temperature ) , thermal stability and considerable strength , about 20 times higher than the single GO scaffold .

Detailed insight into FFF and DIW processing parameters . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) may offer a flexible , cost-effective approach to address conventional manufacturing limitations , such as time-consuming , high work-in-progress , multi-step assembly . 
In principle AM can also allow more novel geometric or even bespoke designs of structural and functional products . 
However , in terms of energy storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors , the benefits of AM have not yet been explored to any significant extent . 
In this paper , a hybrid-AM system , combining low-cost fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) and direct ink writing ( DIW ) techniques , has been designed to fabricate supercapacitors ( electro-chemical double layer capacitors , EDLCs ) in a single , automated operation . 
The inherent flexibility of the AM process provided an opportunity to address restrictions in geometric form factor associated with conventional planar supercapacitor manufacturing approaches . 
Functioning , ring-shaped EDLC devices were manufactured in a single , multi-material operation comprising symmetric activated carbon electrodes in a 1Μ potassium hydroxide ( KOH ) electrolyte hydrogel . 
The work aims to accelerate progress towards monolithic integration of energy storage devices in product manufacture , offering an alternative fabrication process for applications with irregular volume/shape and mass-customization requirements . 
A novel method to quantify the pore size distribution and porosity was proposed . 
New method exhibits high precision , information and repeatability but low cost . 
Electron beam melting ( EBM ) is a representative powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing technology , which is suitable for producing near-net-shape metallic components with complex geometries and near-full densities . 
However , various types of pores are usually present in the additively manufactured components . 
These pores may affect mechanical properties , particularly the fatigue properties . 
Therefore , inspection of size , quantity and distribution of pores is critical for the process control and assessment of additively manufactured components . 
Here , we propose a method to quantify the pore size distribution and porosity of additively manufactured components by utilizing scanning optical microscopy . 
The advantages and limitations of the developed method are discussed based on the comparison study between Archimedes method , conventional optical microscopy and x-ray computed tomography . 
This provides a new metrology for measurement of not only pores but also micro-cracks , which are the common defects in additively manufactured components .

In this paper , the porous SMPU was fabricated by combining extrusion , fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) and salt leaching . 
The filament for FFF was produced by extruding the mixture of SMPU , NaCl , and Tungsten at the desired composition . 
The 3D printed and salt leached porous SMPU was observed to have the porosity in the range of 32.7–36 % and pore sizes of < 250 μm with anthe interconnected network . 
The feasibility of combining fused filament fabrication and salt leaching technique was established for fabricating the radiopaque porous SMPU having the required characteristics for embolization , which can be explored by the Interventional Radiologist . 
Limitations for the current clinical treatment strategies for breast reconstruction have prompted researchers and bioengineers to develop unique techniques based on tissue engineering and regenerative medicine ( TE & RM ) principles . 
Recently , scaffold-guided soft TE has emerged as a promising approach due to its potential to modulate the process of tissue regeneration . 
Herein , we utilized additive biomanufacturing ( ABM ) to develop an original design-based concept for scaffolds which can be applied in TE-based breast reconstruction procedures . 
The scaffold design addresses biomechanical and biological requirements for medium to large-volume regeneration with the potential of customization . 
The model is composed of two independent structural components . 
The external structure provides biomechanical stability to minimize load transduction to the newly formed tissue while the internal structure provides a large pore and fully interconnected pore architecture to facilitate tissue regeneration . 
A methodology was established to design , optimize and 3D print the external structure with customized biomechanical properties . 
The internal structure was also designed and printed with a gradient of pore size and a channel structure to facilitate lipoaspirated fat delivery and entrapment . 
A fused filament fabrication-based printing strategy was employed to print two structures as a monolithic breast implant . 
Numerical simulations of material deposition at corners in material extrusion AM . 
Toolpath smoothing and over-extrusion affect the corner rounding and swelling . 
An optimal amount of toolpath smoothing improves the quality of the corner . 
A uniform track width is obtained with a proportional extrusion rate . 
The material deposition along a toolpath with a sharp corner is simulated with a computational fluid dynamics model . 
We investigate the effects of smoothing the toolpath and material over-extrusion on the corner rounding and the corner swelling , for 90° and 30° turns . 
The toolpath motion is controlled with trapezoidal velocity profiles constrained by a maximal acceleration . 
The toolpath smoothing of the corner is parametrized by a blending acceleration factor . 
Analytical solutions for the deviation of the smoothed toolpath from the trajectory of the sharp corner , as well as the additional printing time required by the deceleration and acceleration phases in the vicinity of the turn are provided . 
Moreover , several scenarios with different blending acceleration factors are simulated , for the cases of a constant extrusion rate and an extrusion rate proportional to the printing head speed . 
The constant extrusion rate causes material over-extrusion during the deceleration and acceleration phases of the printing head . 
However , the toolpath smoothing reduces the corner swelling . 
A uniform road width is obtained with the proportional extrusion rate . 
Proper support geometry design is critical for additive manufacturing ( AM ) techniques to be successful , particularly for material deposition AM techniques , such as fused deposition modeling ( FDM ) . 
Many methods have been proposed for support geometry generation , mostly geared toward FDM and most often with the objective of minimizing support-material use and part-construction time . 
Here , two new support geometry algorithms are proposed , which are particularly suitable for weak support materials : the shell technique , whereby the primary support material would collapse under its own weight and thus a second support material is used to create a containment shell ; the film technique , whereby a second support material is deposited as a thin film between the part and the primary support material . 
The proposed techniques also facilitate support material removal , a laborious manual step for many AM processes . 
Both techniques are demonstrated through the construction of parts using an experimental large-scale 3D foam printer . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) is a promising approach for fabricating structures to serve as bone substitutes , or as biomaterial components in biphasic implants for repair of osteochondral defects . 
In this study , the three dimensional printing ( 3DP ) AM process was investigated to determine the effect of powder layer orientation on mechanical and structural properties of fabricated parts . 
Five types of standard cylindrical parts were manufactured via AM with 0° , 30° , 45° , 60° and 90° stacking layer orientations relative to the vertical z-axis of the print bed , using amorphous calcium polyphosphate ( CPP ) powder of irregular particle shape , average aspect ratio ≈1.70 and particle size between 75 and 150 μm . 
It was concluded that layer orientation had an effect on porosity and compressive strength , based on induced powder particle orientation in the green part during powder layering . 
The resulting bulk porosity values ranged between 30.0 ± 2.4 % and 38.2 ± 2.7 % , while the compressive strength ranged between 13.50 ± 1.95 MPa and 45.13 ± 6.82 MPa . 
The orientation with the highest compressive strength was 90° , while orientations with the weakest compressive strength were 0° and 45° . 
The stacking layer orientation which results in the highest strength performance along a preferred loading orientation can be implemented to further optimize mechanical strength of constructs along the maximum loading direction . 
Recent efforts in the bone and tissue engineering field have been made to create resorbable bone scaffolds that mimic the structure and function of natural bone . 
While enhancing mechanical strength through increased ceramics loading has been shown for sintered parts , few studies have reported that the crosslinked polymer provides strength for the composite parts without post processing . 
The objective of this study is to assess the effect of amylose content on the mechanical and physical properties of starch-hydroxyapatite ( HA ) composite scaffolds for bone and tissue engineering applications . 
Starch-HA composite scaffolds utilizing corn , potato , and cassava sources of gelatinized starch were fabricated through the utilization of a self-designed and built solid freeform fabricator ( SFF ) . 
It was hypothesized that the mechanical strength of the starch-HA scaffolds would increase with increasing amylose content based on the botanical source and weight percentage added . 
Overall , compressive strengths of scaffolds were achieved up to 12.49 ± 0.22 MPa , through the implementation of 5.46 wt % corn starch with a total amylose content of 1.37 % . 
The authors propose a reinforcement mechanism through a matrix of gelled starch particles and interlocking of hydroxyl-rich amylose with hydroxyapatite through hydrogen bonding . 
XRD , FTIR , and FESEM were utilized to further characterize these scaffold structures , ultimately elucidating amylose as a biologically relevant reinforcement phase of resorbable bone scaffolds . 
Significant efforts have been made to treat bone disorders through the development of composite scaffolds utilizing calcium phosphate ( CaP ) using additive manufacturing techniques . 
However , the incorporation of natural polymers with CaP during 3D printing is difficult and remains a formidable challenge in bone and tissue engineering applications . 
The objective of this study is to understand the use of a natural polymer binder system in ceramic composite scaffolds using a ceramic slurry-based solid freeform fabricator ( SFF ) . 
This was achieved through the utilization of naturally sourced gelatinized starch with hydroxyapatite ( HA ) ceramic in order to obtain high mechanical strength and enhanced biological properties of the green part without the need for cross-linking or post processing . 
The parametric effects of solids loading , polycaprolactone ( PCL ) polymer addition , and designed porosity on starch-HA composite scaffolds were measured via mechanical strength , microstructure , and in vitro biocompatibility utilizing human osteoblast cells . 
It was hypothesized that starch incorporation would improve the mechanical strength of the scaffolds and increase proliferation of osteoblast cells in vitro . 
Starch loading was shown to improve mechanical strength from 4.07 ± 0.66 MPa to 10.35 ± 1.10 MPa , more closely resembling the mechanical strength of cancellous bone . 
Based on these results , a reinforcing mechanism of gelatinized starch based on interparticle and apatite crystal interlocking is proposed . 
Morphological characterization utilizing FESEM and MTT cell viability assay showed enhanced osteoblast cell proliferation in the presence of starch and PCL .

For thermally driven AM methods , such as material extrusion AM ( MatEx ) , temperature governs bonding . 
Experimental measurements of temperature are limited in their ability to probe many points in space and time during a process without disturbing the temperature profiles being measured . 
These limitations may be overcome with computational methods ; however , computing power considerations confined simulations to one or two dimensions until recently . 
Additionally , most existing models have had only limited ability to modify geometry or process parameters . 
In this work , an adaptable FEA model capable of simulating heat transfer in 3D and at sufficiently small time scales to capture the rapid cooling in AM is presented . 
Cooling trends from simulation are shown to be in agreement with experimental data . 
Temperature profiles are collapsed to equivalent time at a reference temperature and predict little variation in bonding along the z-axis of a part or with changes in print speed . 
A previously unreported peak in cooling rates for print speeds between 10 and 30 mm/s is shown . 
Uniformity in equivalent time at Tg suggests weld strength will not vary with print speed ; however , high cooling rates for common print speeds may lead to greater residual stresses and reduced mechanical properties . 
Demonstrates PBF printing of high-performance polymer , PPS , on standard printer . 
Evaluates the universality of print parameter selection methods for non-polyamides . 
XY plane printed dogbones show failure at 61.8 ± 4.0 MPa and 3.27 ± 0.22 % . 
In this paper , the authors present evidence of printing poly ( phenylene sulfide ) ( PPS ) , a high-performance polymer , via powder bed fusion ( PBF ) using a bed temperature of 230 °C , which is significantly below both its observed melting temperature ( Tm ˜ 285 °C ) and its observed onset temperature of crystallization ( Tc ˜ 255 °C ) . 
This contradicts existing material screening guidelines for PBF , which suggest maintaining bed temperature above the observed onset of crystallization . 
Existing methods for theoretically determining processing bounds were used to predict a range of energy densities at which PPS can be printed . 
One combination of process parameter values was selected based on machine constraints imposed by typical PBF machines not designed to print high-temperature polymers and used to fabricate multilayer , complex parts . 
The presented process parameters result in final part density upwards of 1.18 g/cm3 and ultimate tensile strength and elongation of 62 MPa and 3.3 % , respectively . 
Hypotheses on the generalizability of low-temperature PBF printing of high-performance polymers , and steps towards updating materials and process parameter selection guidelines for PBF , are also presented . 
We demonstrate a novel Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) nozzle design to enable measurements of in-situ conditions inside FFF nozzles , which is critical to ensuring that the polymer extrudate is flowing at appropriate temperature and flow rate during the part build process . 
Testing was performed with ABS filament using a modified Monoprice Maker Select 3D printer . 
In-situ measurements using the printer ’ s default temperature control settings showed an 11 °C decrease in temperature and significant fluctuation in pressure during printing as well as fluctuations while idle of ± 2 °C and ±14 kPa . 
These deviations were eliminated at lower flow rates with a properly calibrated proportional–integral–derivative ( PID ) system . 
At the highest tested flow rates , decreases in melt temperature as high as 6.5 °C were observed , even with a properly calibrated PID , providing critical insight into the significance of flow rate and PID calibration on actual polymer melt temperature inside the FFF nozzle . 
Pressure readings ranging from 140 to 6900 kPa were measured over a range of filament feed rates and corresponding extrusion flow rates . 
In-situ pressure measurements were higher than theoretical predictions using a power-law fluid model , suggesting that the assumptions used for theoretical calculations may not be completely capturing the dynamics in the FFF liquefier . 
Our nozzle prototype succeeded in measuring the internal conditions of FFF nozzles , thereby providing a number of important insights into the printing process which are vital for monitoring and improving FFF printed parts .

Firstly , an alternative method of filament positioning in material extrusion is proposed , referred to as the ‘ offset method ’ , which aims to reduce the volume of empty cavities between deposited material . 
Then the shear properties , density properties , and cross-sectional void surface area are compared to structures printed using the aligned printing method . 
Experimental results on solid printed ( no infill ) samples , through four different- sized nozzles , have shown the newly proposed method produces a 6.5 % increase in density and a 7.2 % improvement in maximum in-plane shear stress per millimetre increase in nozzle size , compared with the aligned method of FFF . 
The offset method was found to produce a material with increased interlayer contact , compared to the aligned method , which results in a higher fictitious shear stress modulus . 
The effect of the increased interlayer contact on the fictitious shear modulus and real shear stress was investigated using a FEM analysis of the unit cells . 
In short , using the same feedstock material , the offset method produces a stiffer material with a higher fictitious shear strength than the aligned method of FFF printing . 
This study focuses on the characterization of additive manufacturing technology based on composite filament fabrication ( CFF ) . 
CFF utilizes a similar method of layer by layer printing as fused filament fabrication but is also capable of reinforcing parts with layers of various continuous fibers into a polymer matrix . 
Due to the orthotropic characteristics of additive manufacturing based on fused filament fabrication , 3D printed parts may present different mechanical behavior under different orientations of stress . 
Furthermore , technologies such as CFF allow a range of configurations to fabricate and reinforce the parts . 
In this study , mechanical characterization of polyamide 6 ( PA6 ) reinforced with carbon fiber was conducted by design of experiment as a statistical method , to investigate the effect of reinforcement pattern , reinforcement distribution , print orientation and percentage of fiber on compressive and flexural mechanical properties . 
CFF technology 3D print stronger parts than conventional additive manufacturing technologies . 
Maximized compressive response was achieved with a 0.2444 Carbon Fiber volume ratio , concentric and equidistant reinforcement configuration , resulting in a compressive modulus of 2.102 GPa and a stress at proportional limit of 53.3 MPa . 
Maximized flexural response was achieved with 0.4893 Carbon Fiber volume ratio , concentric reinforcement and perpendicular to the applied force , resulting in a flexural modulus of 14.17 GPa and a proportional limit of 231.1 MPa . 
This study presents development of a test method for characterization of interlayer , mode-I fracture toughness of fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) materials using a modified double cantilever beam ( DCB ) test . 
This test consists of DCB specimen fabricated from using unidirectional FFF layers , an 8 μm Kapton starter crack inserted in the midplane during the printing process , and reinforcing glass/epoxy doublers to prevent DCB arm failure during loading . 
DCB specimens are manufactured with a commercially available 3D printer using unreinforced Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene ( ABS ) and chopped carbon-fiber-reinforced ABS ( CF-ABS ) filaments . 
To examine the effect of the FFF printing process on fracture toughness , additional ABS and CF-ABS specimens are hot-press molded using the filament material , and tested with the single end notch bend ( SENB ) specimen configuration . 
The fracture toughness data from DCB and SENB tests reveal that the FFF process significantly lowers the mode-I fracture toughness of ABS and CF-ABS . 
For both materials , in situ thermal imaging and post-mortem fractography shows , respectively , rapid cool-down of the rasters during filament deposition and presence of voids between adjacent raster roads ; both of which serve to reduce fracture toughness . 
For CF-ABS specimens , fracture toughness is further reduced by inclusion of poorly wetted chopped carbon fibers . 
Although this study did not attempt to optimize the fracture performance of FFF specimens , the results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is suitable for design and optimization of FFF processes for improved interlayer fracture performance . 
Polyimides are a group of high performance thermal stable dielectric materials used in diverse applications . 
In this article , we synthesized and developed a high-performance polyimide precursor ink for a Material Jetting ( MJ ) process . 
The proposed ink formulation was shown to form a uniform and dense polyimide film through reactive MJ utilising real-time thermo-imidisation process . 
By means of selectively depositing 4 μm thick patches at the cross-over points of two circuit patterns , a traditional double-sided printed circuit board ( PCB ) can be printed on one side , providing the user with higher design freedom to achieve a more compact high performance PCB structure .

This paper presents an end-to-end design process for compliance minimization-based topological optimization of cellular structures through to the realization of a final printed product . 
Homogenization is used to derive properties representative of these structures through direct numerical simulation of unit cell models . 
The resulting homogenized properties are then used assuming uniform distribution of the cellular structure to compute the macroscale structure . 
Results are presented that illustrate the fine-scale stresses developed in the macroscale optimized part as well as the effect that fine-scale structure has on the optimized topology . 
Quite fine cellular structures are shown to be possible using this method . 
Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) is the most widely available Additive Manufacturing technology . 
Offering the possibility of producing complex geometries in a compressed product development cycle and in a plethora of materials , it comes as no surprise that FFF is attractive to multiple industries , including the automotive and aerospace segments . 
However , the high anisotropy of parts developed through this technique implies that failure prediction is extremely difficult -a requirement that must be satisfied to guarantee the safety of the final user . 
This work applies a criterion that incorporates stress interactions to define a 3D failure envelope that could prove an invaluable tool in formalizing the embrace of FFF in industry . 
Tensile , compressive and torsion tests were executed on coupons developed in a traditional FFF printer , as well as a customized , 6-axis robotic printer necessary to produce specimens in out of ordinary orientations . 
These tests were used to calculate the parameters of the mathematical function that describe the failure envelope . 
Mechanical tests clearly showed significant difference between tensile , compressive and shear strengths . 
The calculated envelope shows strong interactions between axial loads , and a considerable interaction between shear stresses and loads applied in directions parallel and perpendicular to the beads . 
A new class of high-performance resins are available for additive manufacturing with the introduction of Digital Light Synthesis ( DLS ) technology . 
In combination with Continuous Liquid Interface Production ( CLIP ) , DLS uses ultraviolet light and oxygen to continuously grow objects from a pool of resin instead of printing them layer-by-layer , subsequently increasing the printing speed and the mechanical performance . 
For many DLS resin systems , a secondary thermal curing step is required in order to reach the final material properties after printing . 
This step is a major limiting factor in the production time of the DLS process , as materials may require several hours of thermal post curing . 
The aim of this study is to optimize this secondary curing cycle for the epoxy-based resin EPX 82 by reducing the thermal curing time while avoiding a negative influence on the final mechanical properties . 
Differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) was used with different heating rates and a chemical reaction model was developed . 
The Di Benedetto relationship was used to include diffusion control for high degrees of cure . 
Powder Bed Fusion ( PBF ) is a range of advanced manufacturing technologies that can fabricate three-dimensional assets directly from CAD data , on a successive layer-by-layer strategy by using thermal energy , typically from a laser source , to irradiate and fuse particles within a powder bed.The aim of this paper was to investigate the application of this advanced manufacturing technique to process ceramic multicomponent materials into 3D layered structures . 
The materials used matched those found on the Lunar and Martian surfaces . 
The indigenous extra-terrestrial Lunar and Martian materials could potentially be used for manufacturing physical assets onsite ( i.e. 
, off-world ) on future planetary exploration missions and could cover a range of potential applications including : infrastructure , radiation shielding , thermal storage , etc.Two different simulants of the mineralogical and basic properties of Lunar and Martian indigenous materials were used for the purpose of this study and processed with commercially available laser additive manufacturing equipment . 
The results of the laser processing were investigated and quantified through mechanical hardness testing , optical and scanning electron microscopy , X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy , thermo-gravimetric analysis , spectrometry , and finally X-ray diffraction.The research resulted in the identification of a range of process parameters that resulted in the successful manufacture of three-dimensional components from Lunar and Martian ceramic multicomponent simulant materials . 
The feasibility of using thermal based additive manufacturing with multi-component ceramic materials has therefore been established , which represents a potential solution to off-world bulk structure manufacture for future human space exploration . 
This study investigates the moisture absorption characteristics of the ULTEM® 9085 filament and how the uptake concentration affects the quality of material extrusion manufactured 3-D parts . 
The rate of transport was modeled by Fickian diffusion and diffusion coefficients were obtained for various exposure conditions . 
Moduli , strain to failure and ultimate strength were evaluated in the XY ( flat horizontal ) and ZX ( vertical ) direction relative to the build plate orientation . 
Image analyses of cross-sections as well as their corresponding fracture surfaces were evaluated for consolidation , porosity distribution and failure behavior . 
Mechanical test data showed a significant decrease in tensile strength ( > 60 % ) and failure strain ( > 50 % ) over the range of filament moisture levels investigated . 
A decrease in failure strain of 41 % was observed with moisture levels as low as 0.16 % . 
This degradation was especially sensitive in parts printed in the vertical direction , which resulted in an ultimate failure strain of only 1 % . 
The changes in mechanical performance are believed to be due to a combination of entrapped volatiles resulting in increased porosity at higher moisture levels as well as moisture induced pseudo-crosslinking at lower concentrations . 
Optical micrographs showed that specimens with 0.16 % moisture or greater were filled with observable porosity and increased surface roughness . 
The rheological behavior of extruded material indicated plasticization as evidenced by melt flow index measurements and changes in the flow characteristics of moisture-exposed extrudate . 
DMA data show a distinct decrease in Tg with increased moisture content , which is consistent with plasticization . 
The absorption characteristics at room temperature lab conditions indicate that the material will reach an unacceptable level within one hour of room-temperature exposure . 
This investigation emphasized the need for awareness of the moisture sensitivities of ULTEM® 9085 when manufacturing high-quality material extrusion processed structures . 
Stereolithography ( SL ) is an additive manufacturing technique that uses light to cure liquid resins into thin layers and fabricate 3-dimensional objects layer by layer . 
SL is of high interest for small-volume manufacturing and rapid prototyping because of its ability to relatively quickly create objects with intricate 100 μm or smaller features . 
However , widespread adoption of SL faces a number of obstacles including unsuitable thermomechanical properties , anisotropic properties , and limited resolution and fidelity . 
In this work , we incorporate a reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer ( RAFT ) agent into a glassy acrylate formulation to modify mechanical properties and improve resolution of objects printed using digital light processing ( DLP ) SL . 
Incorporating a small amount of a trithiocarbonate RAFT agent into the formulation leads to increased elongation and toughness accompanied by a small decrease in tensile modulus . 
To determine anisotropic properties of DLP SL , samples were printed in “ horizontal ” or “ vertical ” directions , where the long axis of the sample was printed in the x-axis or z-axis , respectively . 
RAFT samples printed in a vertical orientation exhibit a higher modulus than non-RAFT controls prior to post-cure in addition to a similar modulus with increased toughness upon UV post-cure due to the living/controlled nature of RAFT polymerization . 
Furthermore , incorporating a RAFT agent into the formulation allows significantly higher fidelity printing of a broad range of positive and negative features as small as 100 μm . 
The RAFT formulation allows objects to be printed with significantly better fidelity than non-RAFT formulations , even when a radical scavenger is incorporated to mimic reaction rates observed from the RAFT formulation . 
Additionally , the RAFT agent significantly increases the critical energy parameter determined from the SL working curve , indicating an increase in gel point conversion . 
This work demonstrates the benefits of using controlled/living polymerization in a highly cross-linked acrylate system to improve toughness , modify anisotropic properties , and print high-fidelity features with enhanced properties in 3D printed materials . 
Support structures and materials are indispensable components in many Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) systems in order to fabricate complex 3D structures . 
For inkjet-based AM techniques ( known as Material Jetting ) , there is a paucity of studies on specific inks for fabricating such support structures . 
This limits the potential of fabricating complex 3D objects containing overhanging structures . 
In this paper , we investigate the use of Tripropylene Glycol Diacrylated ( TPGDA ) to prepare a thermally stable ink with reliable printability to produce removable support structures in an experimental Material Jetting system . 
The addition of TGME to the TPGDA was found to considerably reduce the modulus of the photocured structure from 575 MPa down to 27 MPa by forming micro-pores in the cured structure . 
The cured support structure was shown to be easily removed following the fabrication process . 
During TG-IR tests the T5 % temperature of the support structure was above 150 °C whilst the majority of decomposition happened around 400 °C . 
Specimens containing overhanging structures ( gate-like structure , propeller structure ) were successfully manufactured to highlight the viability of the ink as a support material . 
The potential of topology optimization to amplify the benefits of additive manufacturing ( AM ) , by fully exploiting the vast design space that AM allows , is widely recognized . 
However , existing topology optimization approaches do not consider AM-specific limitations during the design process , resulting in designs that are not self-supporting . 
This leads to additional effort and costs in post-processing and use of sacrificial support structures . 
To overcome this difficulty , this paper presents a topology optimization formulation that includes a simplified AM fabrication model implemented as a layerwise filtering procedure . 
Unprintable geometries are effectively excluded from the design space , resulting in fully self-supporting optimized designs . 
The procedure is demonstrated on numerical examples involving compliance minimization , eigenfrequency maximization and compliant mechanism design . 
Despite the applied restrictions , in suitable orientations fully printable AM-restrained designs matched the performance of reference designs obtained by conventional topology optimization . 
To enable the advancement of large-scale additive manufacturing processes , it is necessary to establish and standardize methodologies to characterize the mechanical properties of printed test coupons . 
Due to the large size of the print beads , conventional test standards are inadequate . 
The focus of this study was to determine the feasibility of using Digital image correlation ( DIC ) technology as a key enabler for robust data collection of strain measurements of large 3D printed parts . ) 
glass filled ABS test coupons for adequate contrast . 
Through this technique , Poisson 's ratio and elastic modulus were measured and stress strain curves were generated . 
The data produced by DIC correlated well with failure analysis performed on spent test coupons . 
Additionally , fracture surface analysis of the specimens revealed poor adhesion among the ABS matrix and glass fibers . 
This matrix/fiber debonding demonstrated the need for improved printing parameters to maximize tensile strength . 
Finally , critical length analysis of the fibers revealed them to be dimensionally inadequate . 
In this work , acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS ) was reinforced with a thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer ( TLCP ) for use in Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) . 
As ABS and the selected TLCP do not exhibit overlapping processing temperatures , the composite filaments were generated using a dual extrusion technology which allows processing of such matrix-TLCP combinations . 
The 40.0 wt. 
% TLCP/ABS filaments exhibited a tensile strength and modulus of 169.2 ± 4.0 MPa and 39.9 ± 3.7 GPa , respectively , due to a nearly continuous reinforcement of the filament . 
The postprocessing of the filaments in FFF was carried out below the melting temperature of the TLCP , which allowed the printer to take sharp turns despite having nearly continuous reinforcement . 
On printing with the 40.0 wt. 
% TLCP/ABS filaments , the tensile strength and modulus in the print direction were 74.9 ± 2.4 MPa and 16.5 ± 0.8 GPa , respectively . 
The compression molded specimens exhibited a tensile strength and modulus of 79.6 ± 4.4 MPa and 12.3 ± 1.2 GPa , respectively , whereas the injection molded specimens exhibited 51.3 ± 3.0 MPa and 4.5 ± 0.1 GPa , respectively . 
Moisture absorption degrades the mechanical properties of polymeric parts that are 3D-printed by fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) . 
This limitation is particularly significant for short fiber-reinforced polymers because the mechanical enhancement obtained by the fiber reinforcement can be compromised by the plasticizing effect introduced by water absorption . 
Therefore , the present work investigates the effects of two different coatings , a UV cured acrylate resin and an acrylic varnish , on the moisture absorption of FFF 3D-printed samples consisting of polyamide reinforced by short carbon fibers . 
The coating effects were evaluated by conducting tensile tests to compare the Young ’ s modulus , yield stress , and ultimate stress of the coated and uncoated specimens . 
The results demonstrated a significant reduction of CI and OP with both the acrylic and UV resin coatings , as well as considerable enhancements of these samples ’ mechanical properties . 
Stress-strain curves evidenced a strain reduction after water immersion , which can be ascribed to a greater stability against different moisture conditions . 
These findings indicate the significant potential of the proposed coating processes to extend the use of FFF 3D-printed composite materials to a broader range of applications . 
In this paper , the effects of part build directions or raster orientations have been studied on the strain-life fatigue parameters of a wide range of 3D printed plastic materials . 
These materials have been manufactured through Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) , also known under its trademarked name Fused Deposition Modeling ( FDM ) . 
To do so , precise analyses of fatigue data with the Ramberg-Osgood form of stress-strain curves were utilized through a strain-based approach to fatigue . 
Materials considered in this study were Ultem 9085 , Polycarbonate ( PC ) , and Polylactic Acid ( PLA ) . 
Additive manufactured plastic parts that are FDM-processed exhibited large anisotropy of strain-life fatigue parameters . 
Hence , the upper and lower bounds for fatigue life prediction were introduced based on the strongest and weakest part build directions or raster orientations of 3D printed materials . 
For all materials studied in the present paper , fill densities , which seem to have significant impact on fatigue strength of 3D printed parts , have been selected based on the maximum fatigue strength of each part . 
Results showed that , in some build orientations , the transition fatigue life does not exist . 
In other orientations , in which the plastic strain components are high enough , transition fatigue lives vary roughly between 20–400 cycles . 
This means that if the part design in very low cycle fatigue regime is of interest , plastic strains and more complicated plasticity analysis are needed . 
Results show that the load ratio has no major impact on the fatigue parameters of 3D printed PC parts . 
In addition , changing in the loading type from tensile fatigue to rotating bending fatigue can significantly impact the fatigue strength coefficient of 3D printed PLA specimens however , it does not noticeably alter the fatigue strength exponents . 
Material extrusion additive manufacturing utilizes a thermoplastic polymer in the form of a solid filament as a built material . 
The polymer melts inside the hot-end channel and flows under the pressure generated by the filament feeding force . 
The flow of polymer through the hot-end is not fully understood yet , as it involves many complex phenomena , such as phase transition , shear rate and temperature dependent viscosity , as well as viscoelastic effects . 
In this paper , we investigate experimentally the filament feeding force , as a function of the feeding rate , for different materials ( PLA and ABS ) , liquefier temperatures , nozzle diameters , and lengths of the liquefier . 
Increasing the liquefier length and liquefier temperature are found to extend the linear extrusion regime . 
A model solely based on heat transfer considerations is proposed to estimate the maximum feeding rate before the extrusion becomes unstable . 
The modelling results agree well with the measurements . 
The model can be used to select the hot-end design as well as appropriate printing parameters . 
This paper details a novel study and manufacturing approach of fiber alignment in flexible hybrid carbon fiber composites using Material extrusion . 
Varying carbon fiber volume fractions from 0 to 4 vol % was melt blended with a masterbatch of TPU + 10 wt % MWCNT followed by extrusion . 
The final extrudate was then filament wound onto a spool and two different filament layout orientations , 0° and 45° , were printed to compare their mechanical properties to validate the effect of fiber alignment during the printing process for these flexible fiber composites . 
The 0° printed composites exhibited up to 34 % improvement in stiffness as compared to the 45° composite . 
To validate this fiber orientation , the flexible composite was textured using fiber-debonding and pullout phenomenon and the surfaces were visually and quantifiably characterized using SEM images and surface roughness respectively . 
To further elucidate the fiber alignment as indicated by the surface roughness , a water contact angle hydrophobicity test was conducted to prove that the 0° printed composite showed higher contact angle as compared with the 45° orientation , confirming greater entrapment due to fiber alignment at the surface . 
These composites are expected to find future potential in high strength and surface texturing applications . 
Conventional material extrusion additive manufacturing is capable of building complex structures . 
Overhanging features require the use of support structures . 
Printing the support structure requires additional time and material . 
Conventional processes need time to remove support material and may lead to degraded surface finish . 
The use of support structures can be avoided by dynamically reorienting the build-platform . 
This paper presents a novel approach to build accurate thin shell parts using supportless extrusion-based additive manufacturing . 
We describe the layer slicing algorithm , the tool-path planning algorithm , and the neural network-based compensated trajectory generation scheme to use a 3 degree of freedom build-platform and a 3 degree of freedom extrusion tool to build accurate thin shell parts using two manipulators . 
Such thin shell parts can not be built without supports by previous supportless AM processes . 
We illustrate the usefulness of our algorithms by building several thin shell parts . 
Material extrusion ( MEX ) is a well established production method in additive manufacturing . 
However , internal residual strains are accumulated during the layer-by-layer fabrication process . 
They bring about shape distortions and a degradation of mechanical properties . 
In this paper , an in-situ distributed measurement of residual strains in MEX fabricated thermoplastic specimens is achieved for the first time . 
This innovative measuring system consists of an Optical Backscatter Reflectometry ( OBR ) interrogation unit connected to a distributed fiber optic strain sensor which is embedded during the MEX process . 
The characteristic residual strain distribution inside 3D printed components is revealed and numerically validated . 
The main mechanisms of residual strain creation and the sensing principles of in-situ OBR are described . 
A minimum measuring range of 4 mm and a spatial resolution of 0.15 mm were experimentally demonstrated . 
The potential of in-situ OBR technology for detecting invisible manufacturing defects was shown by a trial experiment . 
To aid in the transition of 3D printed parts from prototypes to functional products it is necessary to investigate the mechanical anisotropy induced by the Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) process . 
Since the mechanical properties of an FFF part are most greatly affected by the bead orientation and printed density , or solidity ratio , techniques to precisely control these variables are required . 
An open source Python program , SciSlice , was developed to create the desired tool paths/layer orientations and convert them into machine commands ( e.g . 
G-Code ) . 
SciSlice was then used to develop tool paths which either directly printed tensile specimens or printed sheets from which specimens could be water-jet cut . 
The effects of proper bed leveling and feed wheel adjustment are noted and a careful analysis of both bead orientation and solidity ratio are presented . 
Finally , it is shown that with proper bead orientation , low layer heights , and a maximum solidity ratio , tensile strengths within 3 % of injection molded parts are achievable . 
In this paper the authors present a novel design tool for realizing dielectric structures with spatially varying electromagnetic properties via additive manufacturing ( AM ) . 
To create tool paths ideal for AM processes , space-filling curves were utilized . 
Using fused deposition modeling ( FDM ) , spatially varying structures were printed that produced a spatially varying relative permittivity . 
Furthermore , the authors verified that this design tool can be applied to practical structures by designing , printing and testing a gradient index flat lens . 
Strain-rate dependence is anisotropic in Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing . 
Strain-rate dependence in ME-AM is different from compression molded products . 
Ree-Eyring flow rule can adequately describe the yield kinetics of ME-AM components . 
Compression molded samples show brittle stress-strain behavior . 
Several ME-AM samples show semi-ductile stress-strain behavior . 
The strain-rate dependence of the yield stress for Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing ( ME-AM ) polylactide samples was investigated . 
Apparent densities of the ME-AM processed tensile test specimens were measured and taken into account in order to study the effects of the ME-AM processing step on the material behavior . 
Three different printing parameters were changed to investigate their influence on mechanical properties , i.e . 
infill velocity , infill orientation angle , and bed temperature . 
Additionally , compression molded test samples were manufactured in order to determine bulk properties , which have been compared to the ME-AM sample sets . 
Anisotropy was detected in the strain-rate dependence of the yield stresses . 
The Ree-Eyring modification of the Eyring flow rule is able to accurately describe the strain-rate dependence of the yield stresses , taking two molecular deformation processes into account to describe the yield kinetics . 
The results from this paper further show a change from a brittle behavior in case of compression molded samples to a semi-ductile behavior for some of the ME-AM sample sets . 
This change is attributed to the processing phase and stresses the importance that the temperature profile ( initial fast cooling combined with successive heating cycles ) and the strain profile during ME-AM processing have on the resulting mechanical properties . 
Both these profiles are significantly different from the thermo-mechanical history that material elements experience during conventional processing methods , e.g . 
injection or compression molding . 
This paper can be seen as initial work that can help to further develop predictive numerical tools for Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing , as well as for the design of structural components . 
This study investigates the suitability of direct write ( DW ) technology for the fabrication of high-resolution wear sensors . 
The sintered lines exhibited an electrical resistivity of 5.29 × 10−8 Ω m ( about three times bulk silver resistivity reported in the literature ) with a standard deviation of 3.68 × 10-9 Ω m ( ca . 
7 % variation ) . 
To determine the conditions needed to consistently create fine conductive lines , we simulated the volumetric flow rate and analyzed the effects on line geometry of several printing parameters including valve opening , dispensing gap , and substrate translation speed . 
Our results indicate decreasing the valve opening , decreasing the dispensing gap , and/or increasing the translation speed of the substrate reduces the resultant printing flow rate and cross-sectional area of DW lines . 
Comprehensive mechanical tests are carried out on two new PolyJet elastomers . 
The stress-strain response of PolyJet elastomers is highly sensitive to strain rate . 
A visco-hyperelastic material model captures the strain rate sensitivity of the elastomers . 
The elastomers fully recover after 20 s after repeated cyclic loading . 
Anisotropy in the elastomers is dependent on strain and strain rate . 
Material jetting , particularly PolyJet technology , is an additive manufacturing ( AM ) process which has introduced novel flexible elastomers used in bio-inspired soft robots , compliant structures and dampers . 
Finite Element Analysis ( FEA ) is a key tool for the development of such applications , which requires comprehensive material characterisation utilising advanced material models . 
However , in contrast to conventional rubbers , PolyJet elastomers have been less explored leading to a few material models with various limitations in fidelity . 
Therefore , one aim of this study was to characterise the mechanical response of the latest PolyJet elastomers , Agilus30 ( A30 ) and Tango+ ( T+ ) , under large strain tension-compression and time-dependent high-frequency/relaxation loadings . 
Another aim was to calibrate a visco-hyperelastic material model to accurately predict these responses . 
Tensile , compressive , cyclic , dynamic mechanical analysis ( DMA ) and stress relaxation tests were carried out on pristine A30 and T+ samples . 
Quasi-static tension-compression tests were used to calibrate a 3-term Ogden hyperelastic model . 
Stress relaxation and DMA results were combined to determine the constants of a 5-term Prony series across a large window of relaxation time ( 10 μs–100 s ) . 
A numerical time-stepping scheme was employed to predict the visco-hyperelastic response of the 3D-printed elastomers at large strains and different strain rates . 
In addition , the anisotropy in the elastomers , which stemmed from build orientation , was explored . 
Highly nonlinear stress-strain relationships were observed in both elastomers , with a strong dependency on strain rate . 
Relaxation tests revealed that A30 and T+ elastomers relax to 50 % and 70 % of their peak stress values respectively in less than 20 s. The effect of orientation on the loading response was most pronounced with prints along the Z-direction , particularly at large strains and lower strain rates . 
Moreover , the visco-hyperelastic material model accurately predicted the large strain and time-dependent behaviour of both elastomers . 
Our findings will allow for the development of more accurate computational models of 3D-printed elastomers , which can be utilised for computer-aided design in novel applications requiring flexible or rate-sensitive AM materials . 
Measures thermal conductivity of additively manufactured components . 
Demonstrates significant direction-dependence of thermal conductivity . 
Demonstrates significant effect of process parameters . 
Results may be helpful in design of 3D-printed heat transfer components . 
Additive manufacturing , or 3D printing , is an exciting manufacturing technique based on layer-by-layer build-up as opposed to the subtractive approach in most traditional machining processes . 
Specifically , in polymer-based additive manufacturing processes , filaments of a polymer are dispensed from a rastering extruder to define each layer . 
Due to the directional nature of this process , it is of interest to determine whether thermal transport properties of the built part are direction dependent . 
Such an understanding is critical for accurate design of components that serve a thermal function . 
This paper reports measurement of thermal conductivity of additively manufactured polymer samples in the filament rastering direction and in the build direction . 
Samples are designed and built in order to force heat flow only in one direction during thermal property measurement . 
Experimental data indicate significant anisotropy in thermal conductivity , with the value in the build direction being much lower than in the raster direction . 
Both thermal conductivities are found to depend strongly on the air gap between adjacent filaments . 
A theoretical thermal conduction model is found to be in good agreement with experimental data . 
Cross section images of samples confirm the strong effect of the gap on the microstructure , and hence on thermal properties . 
Results from this paper provide a key insight into the anisotropic nature of thermal conduction in additively manufactured components , and establish the presence of significant inter-layer thermal contact resistance . 
These results may be helpful in the fundamental understanding of heat transfer in 3D-printed components , as well as in accurate design and fabrication of heat transfer components through 3D printing . 
A computational fluid dynamics model is used to predict the mesostructure formed by the successive deposition of parallel strands in material extrusion additive manufacturing . 
The numerical model simulates the extrusion of the material onto the substrate . 
The simulated mesostructures are compared to optical micrographs of the mesostructures of 3D-printed samples , and the predictions agree well with the experiments . 
In addition , the influence of the layer thickness , the strand-to-strand distance , and the deposition configuration ( with aligned or skewed layers ) on the formation of the mesostructure is investigated . 
The simulations provide detailed information about the porosity , the inter- and intra-layer bond line densities , and the surface roughness of the mesostructures , which potentially can be used in a model-based slicing software . 
Lithography-based Additive Manufacturing Technologies ( L-AMT ) exploit the curing of photosensitive materials upon light exposure . 
We developed a hybrid exposure concept . 
This system is able to overcome the challenge of providing good surface qualities and excellent feature resolution as well as a throughput similar to dynamic mask-based L-AMT systems by combining two light sources . 
A Digital Light Processing ( DLP® ) Light Engine ( LE ) with a building area of 144 x 90 mm² offers a pixelsize of 56 μm . 
In order to further improve the achievable resolution , a continuous laser-exposed contour line ( spot size 20 μm ) on the outside of the projected envelope can be written with an additional scanning laser-system . 
The matching of the DLP® projection mask and the laser-contour is crucial for accurate printing . 
Therefore a calibration tool was developed , which facilitates the alignment of the two light sources . 
A dichroic coated mirror enables a perpendicular alignment of the DLP® light beam and the laser beam . 
In this paper , we formulate the generation of support structures for additive manufacturing as a topology optimization problem . 
Compared with usual geometric considerations based support structure design , this formulation affords mechanistic meaning to the computed support structures . 
Moreover , our study reveals that the topology optimization formulation generally leads to self-supporting designs without extraneous self-supporting constraints . 
The resulting support structures have been 3D printed , demonstrating that the computed designs can successfully be used as supports . 
To better understand the impact of complex structure on mechanical properties in additively manufactured ceramics , truss structures were 3D printed in preceramic polymer and mechanically evaluated in the pyrolyzed SiOC state . 
Specimens were printed using digital light processing with a siloxane polymer resin blend . 
Four different designs were printed : two bending-dominant Kelvin cell structures , a stretching-dominant octet structure , and a mixture of the two with geometries chosen for equivalent stiffness . 
Mechanical characterization was done at multiple length scales : uniaxial compression to evaluate the entire truss structure , and three-point flexure to assess individual beam elements . 
After pyrolysis , it was found that truss designs exhibited different shrinkages at the beam element scale despite being composed of the same preceramic polymer and exhibiting isotropic shrinkage at the macro-truss scale . 
This manner of nonuniform shrinkage has rarely , if ever been reported , as it is standard practice in additive manufacturing to report only bulk linear shrinkage . 
In uniaxial compression , Kelvin structures with thicker beams exhibited the highest strength of 10 MPa , and octet structures exhibited the lowest strength of 3.8 MPa . 
In beam element flexure however , the octet beams had the highest strength , 1.9 GPa , four times stronger than the Kelvin beam elements and 500 times stronger than the octet bulk structure . 
Achieving better control in fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) relies on a molecular understanding of how thermoplastic printing materials behave during the printing process . 
For semi-crystalline polymers , the ultimate crystal morphology and how it develops during cooling is crucial to determining part properties . 
Here crystallisation kinetics are added to a previously-developed model , which contains a molecularly-aware constitutive equation to describe polymer stretch and orientation during typical non-isothermal FFF flow , and conditions under which flow-enhanced nucleation occurs due to residual stretch are revealed . 
Flow-enhanced nucleation leads to accelerated crystallisation times at the surface of a deposited filament , whilst the bulk of the filament is governed by slower quiescent kinetics . 
The predicted time to 10 % crystallinity , t10 , is in quantitative agreement with in-situ Raman spectroscopy measurements of polycaprolactone ( PCL ) . 
The model highlights important features not captured by a single measurement of t10 . 
In particular , the crystal morphology varies cross-sectionally , with smaller spherulites forming in an outer skin layer , explaining features observed in full transient crystallisation measurements . 
Finally , exploitation of flow-enhanced crystallisation is proposed as a mechanism to increase weld strength at the interface between deposited filaments . 
In nature , mesoscopic or microscopic cellular structures like trabecular bone , wood , shell , and sea urchin , can have high load-carrying capacity . 
These cellular structures with diverse shapes , forms and designs can be mainly classified into open and closed cell cellular structures . 
It is difficult to replicate these natural complex lattice structures with traditional manufacturing , but additive manufacturing ( AM ) technology development has allowed engineers and scientists to mimic these natural structures . 
Fabricating close cell lattice structures is still considered difficult due to the support structure within the lattices . 
This paper evaluates a novel way of fabricating a close cell lattice structure with a material extrusion process . 
The design eliminates the need for support structures and the subsequent post-processing required to remove them . 
A shell-shaped close cell lattice structure bio-mimicking a sea urchin shape was introduced for the load-bearing structure application . 
The mechanical properties of the proposed structure , including stiffness , deformation behavior and energy absorption , were compared with those of benchmarked honeycomb and open cell sea urchin ( SU ) lattice structures of the same density . 
SU lattice structures and honeycomb periodic lattice structures with varied sizes but the same morphology and fixed density were designed and printed in polylactic acid material ( PLA ) . 
Their physical characteristics , deformation behavior , and compressive properties were investigated experimentally and via finite element analysis . 
The effect of the unit cell size on mechanical properties was studied and discussed , and the rankings of better performances were drawn . 
A possible application of the closed cell is for fabricating the load bearing structure ; it can also be encapsulated within a fluid to impart strength and damping characteristics . 
An anisotropic cohesive zone model with XFEM is developed to capture fracture in additively manufactured polymer materials . 
The XFEM is able to model crack propagations in 3D printed materials without knowing a priori the crack path . 
Parametric studies show that the competition between inter-layer failure and max principal stress failure largely affects the kinked cracks . 
The fracture of additively manufactured polymer materials with various layer orientations is studied using the extended finite element method ( XFEM ) in an anisotropic cohesive zone model ( CZM ) . 
The single edge notched bending ( SENB ) specimens made of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene ( ABS ) materials through fused filament fabrications with various crack tip/layer orientations are considered . 
The XFEM coupled with anisotropic CZM is employed to model the brittle fracture ( fracture between layers ) , ductile fracture ( fracture through layers ) , as well as kinked fracture behaviors of ABS specimens printed with vertical , horizontal , and oblique layer orientations , respectively . 
Both elastic and elastoplastic fracture models , coupled with linear or exponential traction-separation laws , are developed for the inter-layer and cross-layer fracture , respectively . 
For mixed inter-/cross- layer fracture , an anisotropic cohesive zone model is developed to predict the kinked crack propagations . 
Two crack initiation and evolution criteria are defined to include both crack propagation between layers ( weak plane failure ) and crack penetration through layers ( maximum principal stress failure ) that jointly determine the zig-zag crack growth paths . 
The anisotropic cohesive zone model with XFEM developed in this study is able to capture different fracture behaviors of additively manufactured ABS samples with different layer orientations . 
A conformal , compliant and multi-layer tactile sensor was built layer by layer using a hybrid manufacturing process including conformal Direct-Print ( DP ) technology and layer by layer soft molding process with a developed piezoresistive polymer/nanocomposite . 
A multi-layer conformal skin structure of the sensor was created using the soft molding process along with a highly flexible rubber material . 
Two layers of sensing elements were designed , where the sensing elements in the lower sensing layer were orthogonally placed against those in the upper sensing layer so that the sensing elements in two layers could cross each other with an insulating layer between them . 
A conformal printing algorithm was developed to advance the capability of DP technology . 
Thus , all the sensing elements were printed uniformly within the conformal skin structure . 
Several experiments on position detection were performed to evaluate the performance of the fabricated conformal sensor . 
The results showed that the sensor can detect locations of external forces applied on the sensor surface due to the multiple layers of sensing elements . 
It is concluded that the suggested manufacturing methods and developed materials are promising tools to develop conformal , compliant tactile sensors . 
Microstereolithography ( MSL ) has been employed to create 3D microstructures for a wide range of applications . 
Despite the many advantages of using this process , there are still several drawbacks such as the need to use a large amount of a material compared to the volume of the microstructure to be built , oxygen inhibition , and difficulty in processing highly viscous photopolymers . 
To minimize the amount of material required , the use of a liquid bridge has been suggested as a modification to the existing microstereolithography process . 
A liquid bridge can be easily found in nature after a rainfall . 
Basically , a bridge can be formed between two solid bodies , where surface tension can sustain a liquid bridge against a gravitational force , which tends to destroy it . 
With this natural phenomenon , a photopolymer can be intentionally formed between two substrates : a transparent substrate with a low surface energy can be used as a top substrate , while another substrate with a higher surface energy can be used to hold the fabricated structure together . 
This process , called liquid bridge microstereolithography ( LBMSL ) , is advantageous since it uses a relatively small amount of a material , removes oxygen inhibition due to the constraint of the material surface , and offers the possibility of utilizing a highly viscous material . 
In this study , a mathematical model was taken to simulate a liquid bridge with a certain volume and height . 
Adhesion tests were accomplished to ensure the fabricated layer detaches from the top substrate while the fabricated structure remains attached to the bottom structure . 
Finally , various 3D microstructures were fabricated by LBMSL ; these fabricated microstructures provide compelling evidence that LBMSL is advantageous over the existing process for MSL . 
The paper presents a method to optimize build orientation and topological layout simultaneously in density-based topology optimization for additive manufacturing . 
Support structures are required in additive manufacturing of parts of complex shape . 
To eliminate or reduce support structures during the additive processes , we constrain the lower bound of the overhang angle of the optimized design . 
In this method , the build orientation and the density field used to represent the part are simultaneously optimized to satisfy the overhang angle constraints for part self-support . 
The first directional gradient based global constraint controls the overhang angle of the solid/void interface inside the design domain to eliminate the internal supports . 
The second density-based global constraint controls the angle of the design domain boundary to reduce the external supports . 
Numerical examples on both 2D and 3D linear elastic problems are presented to demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed formulations in the build orientation optimization and in the overhang angle control . 
As the application space for large-scale 3D printed components continues to grow , it is necessary to identify appropriate processing conditions for high-performance thermoplastics on large format Additive Manufacturing ( LFAM ) systems . 
This study compares the rheological behavior of a high-performance thermoplastic , polyphenylsulfone ( PPSU ) , with that of a commonly used low-temperature polymer , acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS ) , to identify suitable processing conditions for large format AM systems . 
The linear viscoelastic properties ( complex viscosity , storage modulus , loss modulus , and tan delta ) of these materials are evaluated as a function of temperature , angular frequency , and carbon fiber content . 
The addition of 20–35 % by weight of carbon fiber increased the shear thinning effect of both thermoplastics , showing a potential variation of 2–3 x over the range of expected LFAM extrusion shear rates ( 10–100 s−1 ) . 
Sustainable and environmentally friendly process for spherical poly ( L-lactide ) ( PLLA ) particles for Additive Manufacturing . 
PLLA microspheres produced by liquid-liquid phase separation and precipitation using triacetin as solvent . 
Particle characterization with respect to processability in powder bed fusion ( PBF ) of polymers . 
Narrowly distributed , spherical PLLA powders show excellent flowability . 
Manufacturing and mechanical characterization of 3D printed tensile test bars and complex porous gyroid specimens . 
In this work , the development and processing behavior of poly ( L-lactide ) ( PLLA ) particles for powder bed fusion ( PBF ) of polymers obtained via a green and sustainable process route are thoroughly studied . 
Liquid-liquid phase separation and precipitation from triacetin , a non-toxic solvent , are applied for the production of highly spherical PLLA particles of excellent flowability . 
Starting from the measured cloud-point diagram of the PLLA-triacetin system , appropriate temperature profiles for the precipitation process are derived . 
The effect of process parameters on the product properties is addressed in detail ; the PLLA particles are characterized regarding their size distribution and morphology . 
Furthermore , material properties including thermal behavior ( c.f . 
processing window for powder bed fusion ( PBF ) ) and powder flowability are assessed . 
The spherical PLLA particles of narrow size distribution display a wide sintering window of 59 K and an excellent flowability due to the intrinsic surface roughness of the particles . 
Thus , tensile test bars and complex porous gyroid specimens were successfully manufactured via PBF without the need for any additional surface functionalization of the particles with flow agents . 
The high potential of the newly developed PLLA powders produced via an environmentally friendly approach omitting the use of halogenated or toxic solvents , as well as flowing aids , is demonstrated by mechanical testing of the printed specimens . 
Composite textiles have found widespread use and advantages in various industries and applications . 
The constant demand for high-quality products and services requires companies to minimize their manufacturing costs and delivery time in order to compete with general and niche marketplaces . 
Creation of molding and tooling options for advanced composites encompasses a large portion of fabrication time , making it a costly process and a restraining factor . 
This research discusses a preliminary investigation into the use and control of soluble polymer compounds and additive manufacturing to fabricate sacrificial molds . 
These molds suffer from dimensional errors due to several factors , which have also been characterized . 
The basic soluble mold of a composite is 3D printed to meet the desired dimensions and geometry of holistic structures or spliced components . 
The time taken to dissolve the mold depends on the rate of agitation of the solvent . 
This process is steered towards enabling the implantation of optoelectronic devices within the composite to provide a sensing capability for structural health monitoring . 
The shape deviation of the 3D printed mold is also studied and compared to its original dimensions to optimize the dimensional quality to produce dimensionally accurate parts of up to 0.02 % error . 
In order to use selective laser sintering to manufacture structural parts for automotive and aerospace applications , the failure conditions of such a component must be understood and predicted . 
A 3D failure criterion for anisotropic materials that incorporates stress interactions is implemented to predict failure of selective laser sintered parts manufactured using polyamide 12 powder . 
Special test specimens that capture tensile , compressive and shear strengths , as single or combined loads , were designed , manufactured and tested . 
Results show that significant differences exist between tensile and compressive strengths , and that failure of additive manufactured parts is strongly influenced by the interaction between stresses . 
The test data shows an excellent fit with a tensor based failure criterion that includes interaction strength tensor components , thus being able to capture the strength behavior of SLS printed components under complex loading conditions . 
Vat photopolymerization ( VP ) of silicone can produce better finish and higher resolution than the conventional extrusion-based method . 
One challenge in the current bottom-up VP processes is the separation that forms between the cured part and vat at each layer . 
Oxygen-inhibition is commonly adopted as a solution ( i.e . 
LOPP is achieved by a low-absorbance wavelength and a gradient light beam . 
The first experiment measured the effect of beam power ; the second experiment measured the effect of scanning speed . 
The curing speed of 385 nm at the same power level was 10 times slower than 375 nm , but could be scaled up non-linearly by the beam power . 
A tripled light power of 385 nm can accelerate the process by a factor of 7 and be comparable to that of 375 nm . 
Thus , this study confirms the feasibility of an optically created dead zone and also uncovers the necessity of high-power light source for this application . 
Fused deposition modelling ( FDM ) is a well-known additive manufacturing technique , which can transfer digital three-dimensional ( 3D ) models into functional components directly . 
Despite many advantages FDM can offer , poor surface accuracy of fabricated objects has always been a big issue that attracts increasing attention . 
To study the influence on the surface profiles imposed by various process parameters effectively as well as quantitatively , the mathematical model of the surface profile need to be developed . 
In this work , a new surface profile model is developed to characterize the surface profile of FDM fabricated parts . 
The process parameters are classified into two groups ( i.e . 
pre-process parameters and fabrication process parameters ) to investigate the impacts on surface characterization . 
Corresponding experiments are conducted using an FDM machine to make comparison with the predicted values and to validate the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed surface models . 
Both the experimental results and theoretical values indicate that the surface accuracy of the top surface is mainly determined by the ratio between molten paste flowrate and the nozzle feedrate under specified layer thickness and path spacing . 
On the other hand , the surface quality of the side surface is primarily affected by the layer thickness and the stratification angle of the surface . 
At the same time , some optimization approaches for the surface improvement are presented : appropriate ratio between paste flowrate and fabrication speed are required for desirable top surface and thinner layer thickness can , to some extent , alleviate the staircase effect out of the slicing procedure and the stratification angle of the side surface should be confined to a range to avoid large geometric errors . 
In this study , an in situ bioprinting-based methodological workflow is advanced to directly fabricate a custom engineered skin graft onto a skin burn phantom . 
To illustrate this modular approach , a burn phantom is first created by mold casting gelatin-alginate hydrogel material to simulate a burn wound bed with arbitrary 2D shape and uniform depth . 
The cast hydrogel phantom is then placed on the printer platform to host the to-be-printed skin graft . 
This is followed by implementing a contour calibration process based on fiducial markers to yield the real dimension and pose of the burn phantom . 
A new directed toolpath generation algorithm is detailed to generate a burn-specific toolpath for the microextrusion-based bioprinting process . 
Based on this method , the bioprinted cell-laden gelatin-alginate hydrogel filaments are precisely arranged in a meshed pattern that is bound by the burn phantom contour . 
Internal geometries defined by the filament and pore dimensional characteristics of the printed construct design can be controlled to promote cell viability , proliferation , and nutrient delivery . 
Printed cell-laden multi-layered constructs are evaluated for single filament and pore dimensional precision , alignment of filaments between layers , and positional accuracy of the filaments within the extracted contour . 
Finally , a 24-hour time course incubation study reveals that the printed constructs preserve their structural properties while cells proliferate and maintain their spatial positioning . 
X-ray interferometry provides a dark-field image , essentially a small-angle X-ray scattering image , of the voids and print defects in an additively manufactured polymer object . 
The samples studied included Stanford Bunnies , fabricated from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS ) and polylactic acid ( PLA ) , and a quadratic test object fabricated from PLA . 
The dark-field projection images show orientation-dependent X-ray scattering which is due to anisotropic voids and gaps at the filament-to-filament interface in these fused deposition modeling additive manufacturing objects . 
SEM corroborates the existence of gaps between filaments.The absorption and dark-field volumes are used to correlate printhead trajectory with print defect density . 
There is a slight increase in X-ray scattering , hence print defect density , at regions with high curvature.Two X-ray interferometry techniques were used : stepped-grating and single-shot . 
As currently developed , stepped-grating has the larger field-of-view—examination of an entire test object—whilst single-shot has the potential for real-time , in situ measurement of the printing process within 1 mm of the printhead . 
Efficient generation of freeform TPMS porous scaffolds . 
Hierarchical scaffold construction based on fractal sheet TPMSs . 
Porosity distribution manipulation according to CT images . 
The external geometry design and manipulation of internal porosity distribution according to the actual application demands are the main challenges of scaffold generation ; moreover , computational efficiency is a key factor that should be considered . 
This paper proposes efficient generation strategies for constructing internal porous architectures by using triply periodic minimal surfaces ( TPMSs ) and external freeform shapes through T-spline surfaces . 
After discretizing the geometries as slicing contours , TPMSs can be efficiently extracted using the intersection-interpolation method in 2D space , and then be offset as infill areas of sheet solids . 
Based on the proposed fractal sheet TPMSs , hierarchical scaffolds are further generated using the refined constrained Delaunay triangulation method to construct multiscale pores . 
The porosity features can be conveniently controlled in 2D space according to the actual computed tomography images . 
Eventually , the resulting infill areas can be directly fabricated as scaffolds by additive manufacturing technology . 
Several experimental instances validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed strategies . 
Additive manufacturing allows design freedom and reduces the cost to manufacture a complex form . 
Prefabrication can be more time-efficient than additive manufacturing . 
Schedule shortening is not the main advantage of Additive manufacturing in construction . 
A breakeven point should be determined to choose the manufacturing method that suits best the need . 
The objective of this paper is to present a reflection on the use of Additive manufacturing in construction . 
In this research examples from manufacturing industries are presented . 
Some Advantages of additive manufacturing in industry were identified . 
Relevant cases used to promote AM for construction are : building rate improvement and schedules shortening . 
Firstly , a comparison between construction and manufacturing industry was presented . 
Secondly , Design and Building rate for construction were studied using data from a French construction company . 
Finally a comparison was made between conventional processes and Additive manufacturing . 
Conventional processes included prefabrication and casting on site . 
Results showed that pre-casting may be faster than AM in some cases . 
Time saving is not necessary the best advantage from applying additive manufacturing to construction . 
Leveraging the technology 's unique ability to selectively place multiple materials throughout a part volume , the authors demonstrate a new approach for the fabrication of a new physical security feature for additively manufactured parts . 
Specifically , the authors create photopolymer suspensions featuring quantum dots – a nanoparticle that absorbs ultraviolet light and emits light in the visible spectrum – that are then embedded into objects created by PolyJet material jetting . 
While the quantum dots appear ordered at the macroscale , their stochastic arrangement at the microscale ( via the inkjetted droplet ) provide the randomness necessary to serve as the key element of a Physical Unclonable Function , essentially transforming the 3D printed object itself as an anti-counterfeiting system . 
In this work the authors explore the effects of quantum dot loading on optical signatures of the nanoparticles in the photopolymer matrix . 
Quantum dot loadings as low as 5 × 10−3 wt. 
% can be detected inside the object with a fluorescent microscope , while this same concentration is invisible to the naked eye . 
By adjusting the magnification of the fluorescent microscope , we demonstrate the feasibility of a new paradigm for three-dimensional security patterns . 
The adaptation of inkjet technology for additive manufacturing ( AM ) enabled the highest standards of print speed and print resolution in the industry . 
However , inkjet printheads impose strict limitations on ink properties . 
Ink compositions ex volatility , rehydration , surface tension , chemical stability , abrasiveness , and electrical properties that deviate from printhead specifications shorten its service life . 
Frequent and complex maintenance procedures are necessary , but replacement is the only solution to declining print quality , accruing heavy maintenance costs . 
This is especially limiting for AM as part quality and properties are closely dependent on ink composition . 
We propose an ink deposition system designed for robustness by implementing modular and dedicated components . 
The system deposits ink in a continuous jet . 
We find optimal process parameters and evaluate system performance in comparison to inkjet and material extrusion ( ME ) . 
The system produces line widths between 0.3-0.5mm , indicating print resolution capabilities are comparable to commercial ME systems . 
Sandwich structures are extensively used in aviation industries to reduce the overall weight of the system . 
Although the mechanical behavior of these structures has been widely studied , the performance of core shape in vibration response has been minimally explored . 
This study focuses on understanding the various influences of sandwich structures considering the following parameters : ( i ) nature of core shape , ( ii ) number of infill shapes , and ( iii ) orientation of cores , which affect the dynamic behavior of sandwich structures . 
Nine sandwich structures comprising three different core shapes , hexagon , triangle , and square shapes , in three different orientations , namely 0° , 45° , and 90° , were considered for the present study . 
These structures in the beginning were put by modal analysis using finite element method ( FEM ) . 
All the nine structures were printed using the fused deposition method to validate the FEM findings , while the DEWE soft data acquisition system was used to estimate the modal parameters ( i ) natural frequency and ( ii ) damping ratio . 
This study demonstrates that although the square core orientated at 0° exhibited superior stiffness in bending loads , the hexagonal core orientated at 0° displayed an admirable combination of both stiffness and damping properties . 
Additive manufacturing shows an intrinsic compatibility with building in extra-terrestrial colonization . 
The use of raw materials found in situ can drastically reduce the complexity of the material supply chain . 
Laser Powder Bed Fusion ( LPBF ) is a flexible option for producing components starting from powder feedstock . 
This work addresses the processability of lunar highlands regolith simulant NU-LHT-2 M by Laser Powder Bed Fusion on an open prototypal system . 
The investigation into the influence of process parameters and different base plate materials ( carbon steel , self-supporting deposition and refractory clay ) was enabled by the in-house developed LPBF machine . 
The process feasibility window for multi-layer deposition was determined on the refractory clay base plate which ensured stable deposition . 
Finally , process parameters were studied to produce multi-layer cubical samples which were further analysed for their mechanical properties . 
Specimens presented compressive yield stress values in excess of 31.4 MPa and micro hardness values in excess of 680 HV , showing the potential of the technology for the deposition of lunar regolith components . 
Carbon fiber reinforced polymer ( CFRP ) composite is known for its high stiffness-to-weight ratio and hence is of great interest in several engineering fields such as aerospace , automotive , defense , etc . 
However , such a composite is not suitable for energy dissipation as failure occurs with very little or no plastic deformation . 
Herein , we present an extendable multi-material projection microstereolithography process capable of producing carbon-fiber-reinforced cellular materials that achieve simultaneously high specific stiffness and damping coefficient . 
Inspired by the upper bounds of stiffness-loss coefficient in a two-phase composite , we designed and additively manufactured CFRP microlattices with soft phases architected into selected stiff-phase struts . 
Our results , confirmed by experimental and analytical calculations , revealed that the damping performance can be significantly enhanced by the addition of only a small fraction of the soft phase . 
The presented design and additive manufacturing strategy allow for optimizing mutually exclusive properties . 
As a result , these CFRP microlattices achieved high specific stiffness comparable to commercial CFRP , technical ceramics , and composites , while being dissipative like elastomers . 
This paper presents an experimental approach to investigate the effects of variation in the process parameter settings , found commonly in most fused deposition modelling printers , on the geometrical properties of the printed parts . 
A benchmark component was designed to include simple geometric features which allows for measurement for both dimensional accuracy and geometric characteristics . 
Taguchi ’ s design of experiment statistical approach was used to establish the relationship between varying process parameter settings on the geometrical properties of the benchmark component . 
The critical process parameters affecting both the dimensional accuracy and geometric characteristics are identified and the theoretical optimum print settings were found . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) is a key enabler for architectured lattice materials , because of the geometric complexity of parts that can be produced . 
Recent advancements in AM have enabled rapid production speeds , high spatial resolution , and a variety of engineering polymers . 
An open question remains whether production grade AM can accurately and repeatably produce lattice parts . 
This study presents design , production , and mechanical property testing of hexagonal lattice parts manufactured using continuous liquid interface production ( CLIP ) based AM . 
We printed and tested 84 parts , in three polymer materials having relative density ranging from 0.06 to 0.23 . 
Lattice wall structures were reliably printed when truss aspect ratio was in the range 5 to 20 and wall thicknesses were 0.35 or 0.5 mm . 
The printed lattice parts , each comprising hundreds of slender walls , were measured using high resolution optical scanning . 
The images were analyzed to evaluate the difference between the printed parts and their designs , and the effect of geometric deviations on the mechanical behavior . 
The measured elastic moduli of the printed parts are close to the values expected from the materials specifications . 
The measured strength of the printed parts deviates by 7 % from the behavior predicted from the scanned geometry . 
The failure mode of the printed structures depends upon the material and part geometry . 
To our knowledge , this is the largest study on the accuracy and performance of AM lattice parts , and the first study of its type for lattice parts made using CLIP . 
Over the past two decades , additive manufacturing has opened a new window of opportunities in fabricating complex porous matrix structures such as cellular solids . 
Several factors including design , material and process parameters can selectively be varied to tailor the porous properties of products based on the intended application . 
This article addresses the effect of variable throughout layer thickness configuration in the binder-jet additive manufacturing of titanium structures for orthopedic applications . 
Two layer thicknesses of 80 and 150 μm are selectively controlled inside of each titanium sample with four different configurations . 
Several studies were performed , including shrinkage analysis , porosity measurements , and mechanical compression tests to quantify the effect of layer thickness on part quality and mechanical properties . 
The results of the porosity measurement revealed that there is about 5 % variation among the samples with different layer thickness configuration . 
Bulk porosity values obtained from micro computed tomography ( μCT ) scan data placed the bulk porosity of the samples combining more than one layer thickness , in between of the results for control specimens , which were manufactured by applying a single layer thickness throughout the samples . 
Mechanical properties did not show any significant variation , which is attributed to the low range of the porosity deviation ( less than 5 % ) . 
The highest Young ’ s modulus of 3.50 ± 0.4 GPa and yield stress of 175 ± 25 MPa were obtained from analysis of the data achieved from the compression test . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) techniques provide significant advantages over conventional subtractive manufacturing techniques in terms of the wide range of part geometry that can be obtained . 
Powder delivery is a process that occurs thousands of times during the AM build process , consequently assessment of delivery quality would be advantageous in the process in order to provide feedback for process control . 
This paper presents an in-situ quantitative inspection technique for assessing the whole of the powder bed post raking , by using fringe projection profilometry . 
In order to increase accuracy and traceability of the inspection technique , an accepted fringe projection method , is enhanced using a novel surface fitting algorithm employed to reduce the influence of phase error and random noise during calibration . 
A simulation was conducted to verify the accuracy of the proposed system calibration . 
The proposed in-situ inspection technique has been applied in an Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion ( PBF-EB ) machine , also known as Electron Beam Melting ( EBM ) . 
Some examples of melting edge swelling and excessive powder delivery due to rake damage during a real part build are used to demonstrate the system capability on the actual EBM machine . 
Experimental results demonstrate that powder defects can be efficiently inspected and the results used as feedback information in a build process . 
The Big Area Additive Manufacturing ( BAAM ) system can print structures on the order of several meters at high extrusion rates , thereby having the potential to significantly impact automotive , aerospace and energy sectors . 
The functional use of such parts , however , may be limited by mechanical anisotropy , in which the strength of printed parts across successive layers in the build direction ( z-direction ) can be significantly lower than the corresponding in-plane strength ( x-y directions ) . 
This has been primarily attributed to poor bonding between printed layers since the lower layers cool below the glass transition temperature ( Tg ) before the next layer is deposited . 
Therefore , the potential of using infrared heating is considered for increasing the surface temperature of the printed layer just prior to deposition of new material to improve the interlayer strength of the components . 
This study found significant improvements in bond strength for the deposition of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS ) reinforced with 20 % chopped carbon fiber when the surface temperature of the substrate material was increased from below Tg to close to or above Tg using infrared heating . 
The use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) for monitoring , studying and performing output quality measurements of the acrylate-based polymeric patterns manufactured using stereolithography ( SL ) was introduced in this work . 
The effects of build parameters and humid environment on sample homogeneity , distribution of crosslink density , stability and defect formation were examined . 
The spatial resolution of the method was found to be sufficient to identify patterns according to the build parameters used and to detect specific hatch-predicted crosslink density variations . 
Qualitative information obtained using MRI visualisation was supplemented by quantitative measurements of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR ) relaxation times and 1H NMR spectra . 
NMR spectroscopy confirmed the identity of the chemical composition among the patterns and showed that the crosslink density variation observed via spatially resolved T2-profiles stems from the difference of the build parameters . 
Different types of defects in the samples were observed and classified ; some defects originated from local matrix continuity failures ( partially cured resin trapping within the polymer or bubbles formation ) , while other defects were found in the form of bulk layering . 
MRI visualisation coupled with relaxometry and 1H spectroscopy of patterns during their interaction with humidity allowed tracking water distribution inside the sample and observing effects of swelling , fracturing and chemical decomposition . 
As a result , the approach presented in this work improves the output quality control and current testing techniques , provides insight how physical properties of the 3D parts are affected by different technical parameters , and eventually can help the use of SL technologies for a variety of applications . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) is evolving from rapid prototyping to production of structural components . 
The widespread application of AM demands a high level of mechanical performance from these components , and it is therefore essential to improve feedstock material in order to meet these mechanical expectations . 
However , compared to traditional manufacturing techniques , the mechanical properties of AM materials and their resulting components are not well understood . 
In this study , we investigated the processability , microstructure , and mechanical performance of twin-screw compounded short carbon fiber reinforced polyphenylene sulfide ( PPS ) pellets as a feedstock material for big area AM ( BAAM ) . 
The performance of the AM components was compared to that of traditional processing methods , namely injection molding ( IM ) and extrusion-compression molding ( ECM ) . 
It was found that the AM composites exhibited 118 % lower tensile strength and 55 % lower tensile modulus when compared to traditional injection molding composite specimens ; however , AM composites exhibited comparable properties to ECM composites . 
This response was attributed to highly aligned fibers in IM and AM samples . 
However , the AM composites contained porosity ( 15.5 % volume ) , which reduced their mechanical properties in comparison to ECM composites . 
The IM process showed the maximum amount of fiber attrition with minimum porosity ( 0.007 % volume ) , while the ECM process exhibited the least fiber attrition with 4.3 % volume porosity . 
Composite manufacturing processes adapted for assisted-additive manufacturing ( AM ) have recently been proposed . 
Extrusion-based AM utilizes shear-driven alignment in producing printed structures where polymers and fibers naturally align parallel to the material flow . 
Convergent flow geometries become the dominant processing route for thermoplastic-melts and thermoset polymer extrusions . 
For rotational fibers , the phenomenon known as Jeffrey orbits poses issues during extrusion through a convergent channel , resulting in a randomized fiber architecture . 
Methods of minimizing Jeffrey orbits include the application of an additional external force such as a magnetic field to arrest or counteract the rotation . 
This work explores a combination of magnetic forces in conjunction with adjusted channel geometries using theory and experimental observations . 
The findings suggest the ability to alter fiber orientation in flow in a 300 cP viscosity matrix by modifying the extrusion channel geometry . 
Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) has largely relieved the design freedom of functional parts . 
Topology optimization has been widely used to design lightweight structures fabricated by AM . 
In this paper , a general design method is proposed to design solid lattice hybrid structures . 
An optimization algorithm is used in this method that can generate a functionally graded heterogeneous lattice structure connecting the solid part . 
The manufacturability can be improved due to the lattice structure supporting the overhangs . 
A hybrid element model is used to simulate the mechanical performance and optimize the material distribution of the lattice structure . 
To validate the design theory and the advantage of the hybrid structure , a three-point bending beam is designed by the proposed method and the existing methods . 
Both the simulation result and the experimental result show that the hybrid structure has a higher stiffness , yield strength , and critical buckling load than the pure solid structure and the pure lattice structure . 
Advancements in distributed recycling technologies now allow for on-demand reconstitution of traditionally neglected MRE pouch waste into useful appliances via material extrusion additive manufacturing . 
In this work , we demonstrate recycling of MRE pouch materials through a combined compounding , filament extrusion , and fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) additive manufacturing protocol . 
Mechanical properties and barrier properties of additively manufactured structures were evaluated through tensile testing and water vapor transmission testing , respectively , and found to be comparable to the native pouch materials . 
Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Thermogravimetric Analysis of the extruded filament and printed materials were contrasted with native pouch materials , showing minimal effects of the manufacturing process on critical thermal transitions in the polymer . 
To reduce the lead time , polymer fuel tanks could be toollessly produced using additive manufacturing ( AM ) technologies . 
Detailed knowledge of the performance of AM polymers is essential for the design and development of such components . 
In instrumented static ( 0.01 mm/s ) and dynamic ( 2.5 m/s ) three-point bending and puncture tests , the impact behaviors of polyamide and methacrylate-based photopolymer test specimens were compared . 
The polyamide test specimens were produced by laser sintering and multijet fusion , and the photopolymer test specimens were produced by a hot lithography process . 
Fractography was performed using stereo light and scanning electron microscopy to investigate the fracture surface morphology . 
The test results were used to analyze the relationships among the surface roughness , shear modulus , and glass transition temperature . 
The AM polymers revealed comparable force–displacement behaviors in a static three-point bending test , but their impact behaviors differed greatly . 
The obtained results highlight that the impact performance of AM polymers is an essential design variable for fluid-containing parts . 
This investigation focuses on geometric parameters of nozzles used in Fused Filament Fabrication . 
They are mainly responsible for the extrusion force . 
Typical nozzles are made of brass and feature a decrease in diameter from an entry channel to a capillary with a conical section in between . 
Commercially available and custom nozzles with various of these parameters were investigated on a test stand using Polylactic Acid ( PLA ) filament . 
All nozzles exhibit a common behavior . 
The extrusion force rises linearly with increasing filament feed velocity . 
Here , unmolten plastic reaches the nozzle . 
This characteristic is dependent on extrusion temperature and geometric parameters of the nozzles . 
Different capillary lengths were used to determine the entry pressure loss at different filament feed velocities . 
The material and coating of the nozzles had no significant influence on extrusion force . 
A higher thermal mass , two conical sections or two entry channels have a positive effect on extrusion forces and maximum filament feed velocities , thus maximal build rate . 
Multi-material additive manufacturing enables high-performance heterogeneous design at the mesoscale , through which bulk parts can be engineered to adapt to complex loading conditions . 
The optimization of multi-material parts relies on accurate forward prediction , which is challenging to achieve owing to the complex processing conditions in additive manufacturing and the resultant uncertainties in material properties . 
To address these limitations , here we present a new model calibration and model selection framework based on the high dimensional , local-scale deformation data . 
By matching the pixel-level deformation data from digital image correlation experiments and constitutive modeling , the presented framework enables more accurate prediction and significant reduction of the prediction uncertainties , as compared to the single material calibration approach that is widely used in additive manufacturing . 
In turn , this enables quantitative comparison of the candidate models , so the most accurate and computationally efficient constitutive model can be selected for forward prediction in heterogeneous material design . 
The advantages of the framework are demonstrated using a multi-polymer system manufactured by dual-extrusion additive manufacturing , which consists of two constituent materials with dramatically different deformation behaviors . 
Despite the potential benefits of photopolymerization-based additive manufacturing , photochemical reactions in free-radical polymerization rarely proceed to completion , leading to the accumulation of residual monomer in polymer networks . 
In the absence of residual methyl methacrylate , other potentially toxic acrylic esters were observed thus emphasizing the need to thoroughly scrutinize additively manufactured dental devices prior to their use . 
In the long term , standards for medical devices in dentistry could be revised to reflect the current trends in biomaterials and precursors they are generated from . 
The tensile strength and strain properties as well as failure modes in silicone dumbbell specimens fabricated by extrusion-based additive manufacturing are investigated . 
Effects of process parameters , specifically the infill direction ( 0° , ±45° , and 90° relative to the tensile direction ) and adjacent line spacing on the void formation and ultimate tensile strength are studied and compared to the baseline of stamped silicone specimens . 
The additive manufactured specimens with ±45° and 90° infill direction and either the minimal or small void extrusion configuration had the strongest ultimate tensile strength ( average ranged from 1.44 to 1.51 MPa ) . 
This strength is close to that of the sheet stamped specimens which have an average ultimate tensile strength of 1.63 MPa . 
As the void size became larger and more elongated in shape , the average ultimate tensile strength significantly reduced to 1.15 and 0.90 MPa for specimens with ±45° and 90° infill direction , respectively . 
Counterintuitively , specimens with 0° infill direction were consistently the worst performing due to the tangency voids and poor edge surface finish resulting from the toolpath . 
We show that , to maximize ultimate tensile strength of silicone parts made by extrusion-based additive manufacturing , it is important to select process parameters which minimize the elongated voids , infill tangency voids , and surface edges . 
If these conditions can be achieved , the infill direction does not play a significant role in tensile strength of the tensile specimen . 
As part of a larger study on the laser sintering ( LS ) of nano-composite structures for biomedical applications , a wet mixing method was used to coat Polyamide 12 ( PA12 ) particles with nano-hydroxyapatite ( nHA ) . 
The addition of nHA significantly affected powder processability due to laser absorption and heat transfer effects which led to part warping . 
Nano-composites containing 0.5–1.5 wt % nHA were successfully produced and tensile testing showed that 0.5 wt % nHA provided the greatest reinforcement with a 20 % and 15 % increase in modulus and strength respectively . 
However , the elongation at break had significantly declined which was likely due to the formation of nHA aggregates at the sintering borders following the processing of the coated powders despite being initially well dispersed on the particle surface . 
An intelligent optimization system is proposed to establish quantitative relationships between process parameters and multiple optimization objectives , including mechanical properties , productivity , energy efficiency , etc . 
Contour maps of operation window , productivity and energy efficiency can be developed to predict optimal parameters by considering the constraints of mechanical properties and material degradation . 
Using a facile data-driven approach , the relationships between process parameters and optimization objectives can be utilized in the process optimization and material selection . 
Powder bed fusion ( PBF ) represents a class of additive manufacturing processes with the unique advantage of being able to fabricate functional products with complex three-dimensional geometries . 
PBF has been broadly applied in highly value-added industries , including the biomedical device and aerospace industries . 
However , it is challenging to construct a comprehensive knowledgebase to guide material selection and process optimization decisions to satisfy the product standards of various industries based on a poor understanding of process-structure-property/performance relationships for each type of thermoplastic . 
In this paper , an intelligent optimization system is proposed to establish quantitative relationships between process parameters and multiple optimization objectives , including mechanical properties , productivity , energy efficiency , and degree of material degradation . 
Polyurethane is considered as a representative thermoplastic because it is sensitive to thermal-induced degradation and has a relatively narrow process window . 
Material and powder properties as functions of temperature are investigated using systematic material screening . 
Numerical models are created to analyze the interactions between laser beams and polymeric powders by considering the effects of chamber thermal conditions , laser parameters , temperature-dependent properties , and phase transitions of polymers , as well as laser beam characteristics . 
The theoretically predicted features of melting pools are validated experimentally and then utilized to develop quantitative relationships between process parameters and multiple optimization objectives . 
The established relationships can guide process parameter optimization and material selection decisions for polymer PBF . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) is emerging as a promising technology to fabricate cost-effective , customized functional parts . 
Designing such functional , i.e. 
, load bearing , parts can be challenging and time consuming where the goal is to balance performance and material usage . 
Topology optimization ( TO ) is a powerful design method which can complement AM by automating the design process . 
However , for TO to be a useful methodology , the underlying mathematical model must be carefully constructed . 
Specifically , it is well established that parts fabricated through some AM technologies , such as fused deposition modeling ( FDM ) , exhibit behavioral anisotropicity . 
This induced anisotropy can have a negative impact on functionality of the part , and must be considered . 
In the present work , a strength-based topology optimization method for structures with anisotropic materials is presented . 
More specifically , we propose a new topological sensitivity formulation based on strength ratio of non-homogeneous failure criteria , such as Tsai-Wu . 
The rapid transition of the Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) process from small scale prototype models to large scale polymer deposition has been driven , in part , by the addition of short carbon fibers to the polymer feedstock . 
The addition of short carbon fibers improves both the mechanical and thermal properties of the printed beads . 
The improvements to the anisotropic mechanical and thermal properties of the polymer feedstock are dependent on the spatially varying orientation of short carbon fibers which is itself a function of the velocity gradients in the flow field throughout the nozzle and in the extrudate during deposition flow . 
This paper presents a computational approach for simulating the deposition flow that occurs in the Large Area Additive Manufacturing ( LAAM ) process and the effects on the final short fiber orientation state in the deposited polymer bead and the resulting bead mechanical and thermal properties . 
The finite element method is used to evaluate Stokes flow for a two-dimensional planar flow field within a Strangpresse Model 19 LAAM polymer deposition nozzle . 
A shape optimization method is employed to compute the shape of the polymer melt flow free surface below the nozzle exit as the bead is deposited on a moving print platform . 
Three nozzle configurations are considered in this study . 
Fiber orientation tensors are calculated throughout the fluid domain using the Folgar-Tucker fiber interaction model . 
The effective bulk mechanical properties , specifically the longitudinal and transverse moduli , and the coefficient of thermal expansion , are also calculated for the deposited bead based on the spatially varying fiber orientation tensors . 
Fiber orientation is found to be highly aligned along the deposition direction of the resulting bead and the computed properties through the thickness of the bead are found to be affected by nozzle height during deposition . 
Significant improvements to the throughput of additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes are essential to their cost-effectiveness and competitiveness with traditional processing routes . 
Moreover , high-throughput AM processes , in combination with the geometric versatility of AM , will enable entirely new workflows for product design and customization . 
We present the design and validation of a desktop-scale extrusion AM system that achieves a much greater build rate than benchmarked commercial systems . 
This system , which we call ‘ FastFFF ’ , is motivated by our recent analysis of the rate-limiting mechanisms to conventional fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) technology . 
The FastFFF system mutually overcomes these limits , using a nut-feed extruder , laser-heated polymer liquefier , and servo-driven parallel gantry system to achieve high extrusion force , rapid filament heating , and fast gantry motion , respectively . 
The extrusion and heating mechanisms are contained in a compact printhead that receives a threaded filament and augments conduction heat transfer with a fiber-coupled diode laser . 
The prototype system achieves a volumetric build rate of 127 cm3/hr , which is approximately 7-fold greater than commercial desktop FFF systems , at comparable resolution ; the maximum extrusion rate of the printhead is ∼14-fold greater ( 282 cm3/hr ) than our benchmarks . 
The performance limits of the printhead and motion systems are characterized , and the tradeoffs between build rate and resolution are assessed and discussed . 
High-speed desktop AM raises the possibility of new use cases and business models for AM , where handheld parts are built in minutes rather than hours . 
Adaptation of this technology to print high-temperature thermoplastics and composite materials , which require high extrusion forces , is also of interest . 
The driver for this research is the development of multi-material additive manufacturing processes that provide the potential for multi-functional parts to be manufactured in a single operation . 
In order to exploit the potential benefits of this emergent technology , new design , analysis and optimization methods are needed . 
This paper presents a method that enables in the optimization of a multifunctional part by coupling both the system and structural design aspects . 
This is achieved by incorporating the effects of a system , comprised of a number of connected functional components , on the structural response of a part within a structural topology optimization procedure . 
The potential of the proposed method is demonstrated by performing a coupled optimization on a cantilever plate with integrated components and circuitry . 
Biocompatible and biodegradable poly ( lactic acid ) ( PLA ) and hydroxyapatite ( HAP ) are widely used for bone repair . 
In this study , microspheres consisting of poly ( lactic acid ) ( PLA ) and nano-hydroxyapatite ( nano-HAP ) were synthesized by emulsion solvent evaporation and were then used to fabricate layered parts using laser powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) . 
The effect of various parameters of the emulsion solvent evaporation technique on the size and morphology of the resulting PLA/nano-HAP microspheres was examined . 
We also evaluated how L-PBF parameters affected the physicochemical and biological properties of the fabricated parts . 
Nano-HAP was uniformly incorporated into PLA microspheres . 
Incorporation of HAP particles triggered pore formation on the microsphere surface . 
Layered parts fabricated by L-PBF using these composite microspheres as a material source showed good biocompatibility and osteogenesis . 
A 10 wt % of nano-HAP content in the layered part could effectively facilitate osteogenic differentiation of rat mesenchymal stem cells ( rMSCs ) . 
Thus , L-PBF is a promising technology that can be used for manufacturing bone-repair implants consisting of PLA/nano-HAP composites materials . 
In additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes , part and process attributes are often optimized with build orientation/tool-path direction . 
Both of them may alter the layer topology and tool-path pattern which implicitly affect the part and process attributes . 
However , optimizing either build orientation or tool-path direction independently undermines the hierarchical relationship in the AM process plan and may produce a sub-optimal solution . 
In this paper , an integrated framework is proposed to quantify their combined effect on the part and process attributes by analyzing the generated geometry . 
The proposed methodology is designed on the basis of the layer geometries to ensure manufacturability and minimize fabrication complexity in AM processes . 
Both build orientation and tool-path/deposition direction are concurrently optimized using a Genetic Algorithm ( GA ) . 
Multi Jet Fusion process . 
Modelling the capillarity effect in Multi Jet Fusion technology . 
Multi Jet Fusion is a powder-based Additive Manufacturing technology patented by Hewlett-Packard Inc . 
It is characterised by the use of lamps instead of lasers to heat and melt polymers and by fusing and detailing agents that are jetted on the polymeric particles to modify and to control their heat absorption and thus selectively melt them . 
The high production rate and excellent mechanical properties of the manufactured parts , even in comparison with Laser Sintering , together with the overall product quality make this technology effective for a production of small series of end-parts rather than functional prototypes.In the present paper , the so-called capillarity effect is investigated . 
A benchmark geometry was designed to be affected by the capillarity effect and then manufactured by the MJF process . 
Values of the contact angle and of the characteristic length of the capillary , which are necessary to implement the analytical model , were obtained by experimental measurements made on the benchmark geometry.As a result the capillarity effect showed a dependence on the border edge orientation . 
The comparison between calculated shapes of the plane affected by the capillarity effect through the analytical model was in accordance with the experimental measurements thus allowing a reliable prediction to be made . 
Experiment to identify influence factors of nozzle clogging . 
Identification of reasons causing clogging of sphere-filled polycarbonate . 
Model for the occurrence of nozzle clogging . 
Mathematical viscosity model to approximate printability of materials . 
Fused filament fabrication with reinforced or filled polymers provides improved material properties compared to ordinary feedstock . 
A current limitation of these materials is the occurrence of nozzle clogging at higher filler contents . 
In this work , an experiment is designed to identify the factors causing nozzle clogging . 
Glass sphere-filled polycarbonate is investigated by varying nozzle and filler diameters , the resin viscosity , the filler content , and the extrusion pressure . 
Based on these results , a model for the clogging of sphere-filled polymers is proposed . 
Last , a mathematical model is derived , which approximates the printability of filled polymers without the preparation of composites . 
This model is based on the nozzle geometry , the filler type and content , the resin viscosity , and the printer ’ s maximum extrusion force . 
In this study , we propose a tool-path generation approach for material extrusion-based additive manufacturing ( AM ) that considers the machining efficiency and fabrication precision , which are inherent drawbacks of general AM techniques compared with conventional manufacturing methods . 
These three modules interact to affect the efficiency and precision of AM significantly . 
In order to find an optimal inclination , we first analyze the impacts on the fabrication efficiency and manufacturing accuracy with different inclinations . 
A comparatively accurate building time model is developed subsequently to obtain the optimal tool-path inclination , but without compromising the machining precision , based on the analysis of a geometrical accuracy model . 
The proposed approach employs different inclinations in distinct layers according to specific manufacturing scenarios and technological requirements . 
Fused deposition modeling ( FDM ) is shown to be a future-oriented technology . 
In this study , short-term creep deformation of PC-ABS parts created by FDM under different fabrication conditions was investigated using a recently innovative class of experimental design − definitive screening design ( DSD ) − along with graphical analysis . 
Short-term creep experiments were conducted at prescribed combinations of FDM operating conditions , namely layer thickness , air gap , raster angle , build orientation , road width and number of contours , as per DSD matrix . 
The results have shown that layer thickness , number of contours , raster angle and build orientation have a major effect on the creep rate of the parts . 
However , road width and air gap have least impact on the creep rate of FDM processed prototypes . 
We present the design and characterisation of a high-speed sintering additive manufacturing benchmarking artefact following a design-for-metrology approach . 
In an important improvement over conventional approaches , the specifications and operating principles of the instruments that would be used to measure the manufactured artefact were taken into account during its design process . 
With the design-for-metrology methodology , we aim to improve and facilitate measurements on parts produced using additive manufacturing . 
The benchmarking artefact has a number of geometrical features , including sphericity , cylindricity , coaxiality and minimum feature size , all of which are measured using contact , optical and X-ray computed tomography coordinate measuring systems . 
The results highlight the differences between the measuring methods , and the need to establish a specification standards and guidance for the dimensional assessment of additive manufacturing parts . 
Low molecular weight gelators can facilitate direct writing of epoxy resin . 
Low viscosity ink preparation . 
Processing-enabled manipulation of matrix morphology . 
Cured epoxy resin kinetically traps low molecular weight gelator . 
Direct writing a thermosetting resin typically requires a rheological modifier or peripheral reaction rate-modulating equipment to enable shape fidelity during parts fabrication . 
These low molecular weight gelators ( LMWG ) are thermally activated to produce sufficient yield stress for self-supporting , reactive , physical gels . 
Physical gelation occurs by assembly of the LMWG into supramolecular morphologies that vary by mode of processing . 
Flow of the form-stable epoxy resin is induced by yielding of the physical gel structure . 
When the physical gel is cured at temperatures below the melt transition of the organic gelator , the network structure likely kinetically traps the organic gelator in a metastable state . 
Recrystallization of the kinetically trapped organic gelator is impeded when the network is post-cured above the melt transition temperature of the organic gelator . 
The use of low molecular weight agents that physically gel by thermal activation , generates low viscosity solution processability and suggests that this platform may be suitable for high solids loading applications amenable to direct writing . 
The effect on fatigue resistance of additively manufactured ( AM ) AlSi10Mg specimens fabricated by selective laser melting ( SLM ) following surface treatment by shot-peening was investigated . 
Specimen surface was shot-peened with either steel or ceramic balls . 
Nano-indentation measurements revealed that shot-peening caused surface hardening , with the hardness profile from the surface to the interior of the bulk disappearing 50 μm below the surface . 
Surfaces polished before shot-peening or following removal of about 25–30 μm from the surface after shot-peening by either mechanical or electrolytic polishing showed improved fatigue resistance and fatigue limit . 
The fracture area of AM-SLM AlSi10Mg specimens before and after shot-peening displayed a ductile fracture with relatively deep dimples . 
In contrast to AM specimens , the final fracture area of die-cast samples exhibited a brittle fracture surface , containing numerous cleavage facets and micro-cracks . 
The extrusion-based additive manufacturing ( AM ) of moisture-cured silicone elastomer with minimal voids and high strength , elongation , and fatigue life is presented . 
Due to the soft nature and extended cure time of moisture-cured silicone , AM is technically challenging . 
This compression is exploited to prevent void formation in silicone AM . 
This research aims to explore process parameters for voidless silicone AM of solid and thin-wall structures for pneumatic actuators . 
Experiments were performed to study effects of flowrate , layer height , and distance between adjacent silicone lines on the solid and thin-wall vertical layer deformation and void generation . 
The results were then applied in AM of two thin-walled hollow silicone pneumatic parts : the sphere-like balloons and finger pneumatic actuators . 
The sphere-like balloons exhibited diametric expansion between 152 and 207 % with burst stress between 1.46 and 2.55 MPa ( which is comparable to the base material properties ) while the pneumatic finger actuators were able to fully articulate over 30,000 cycles before failure . 
Fiber trajectory of composite structures is optimized for Additive manufacturing . 
The stiffness and strength were simultaneously improved by the proposed method . 
A methodology of fiber trajectory optimization is proposed for Additive Manufacturing of composites . 
The present method aligns fiber with a physically-determined load path to simultaneously increase the stiffness and strength of the composite structures . 
In the case of open-hole panel , the deformation and the failure index were decreased by 8 % and 55 % compared to those obtained by the unidirectional structure . 
In the case of PAF , the decrease in failure index was 76 % , but the reduction of deformation was not significant ( 6 % ) . 
The present method also identified the structural members that did not contribute to strength and rigidity , which in turn realized the appropriate weight savings and increased the specific strength and specific stiffness . 
Microstructures with spatially-varying properties such as trabecular bone are widely seen in nature . 
These functionally graded materials possess smoothly changing microstructural topologies that enable excellent micro and macroscale performance . 
The fabrication of such microstructural materials is now enabled by additive manufacturing ( AM ) . 
A challenging aspect in the computational design of such materials is ensuring compatibility between adjacent microstructures . 
Existing works address this problem by ensuring geometric connectivity between adjacent microstructural unit cells . 
In this paper , we aim to find the optimal connectivity between topology optimized microstructures . 
Recognizing the fact that the optimality of connectivity can be evaluated by the resulting physical properties of the assemblies , we propose to consider the assembly of adjacent cells together with the optimization of individual cells . 
In particular , our method simultaneously optimizes the physical properties of the individual cells as well as those of neighbouring pairs , to ensure material connectivity and smoothly varying physical properties . 
We demonstrate the application of our method in the design of functionally graded materials for implant design ( including an implant prototype made by AM ) , and in the multiscale optimization of structures . 
An analytical model was created to illustrate the powder stream distribution under the four-jet nozzles in direct energy deposition ( DED ) . 
Weight measurement method was used to validate the powder flow distributions at different positions under the nozzle . 
Analyzed the effects of the input variables on the powder stream distribution . 
Estimated the powder deposition efficiency ( PDE ) based on the simulation results . 
As an important factor during direct energy deposition ( DED ) additive manufacturing process , powder stream distribution will not only affect the deposition rate , but also the powder-gas and power-powder interactions , and thus the consequent quality and property of the fabricated part . 
This paper created an analytical model to illustrate the powder stream distribution under the four-jet nozzles in the DED . 
To validate the proposed model , weight measurement method was used to track the powder stream distributions at different positions under the nozzle . 
Additionally , the effects of the input variables , including powder flow rate , gas flow rate and particle size , on the powder stream distribution were also analyzed . 
The results suggest a relatively good agreement between the modelling and experimental measurements . 
At the end , the powder deposition efficiency ( PDE ) was estimated based on the simulation results . 
The influence of build orientation , layer thickness , strain rate and size effect on the Young ’ s modulus , ultimate tensile strength and fracture strains in vat photopolymerization based additively manufactured specimens is investigated . 
Mechanical testing and subsequent scanning electron microscopy tests on additively manufactured specimens are conducted . 
Anisotropy in mechanical behavior is only observed in specimens fabricated in different planes . 
An increase in layer thickness and decrease in strain rate resulted in lower strength , stiffness and higher fracture strains . 
No significant size effect on strength and failure strains is observed . 
Cure kinetics is found to have significant influence on mechanical properties of additively manufactured specimens . 
Warping and delamination in material extrusion additive manufacturing ( MatEx ) parts are well documented and irreversible thermal strain ( ITε ) has also recently been reported . 
As parts are built up as a collection of roads , they are analogous to fiber reinforced composites . 
However , the lack of bonding between the matrix , air , and the reinforcing phase , polymer roads , necessitates the development of a micromechanical model for these parts . 
In this work , a micromechanical model for MatEx parts is developed to describe bulk part behavior that incorporates void fraction , road morphology , and bonding between and within layers . 
Combining stress accumulation within roads with the micromechanical model successfully predicted ITε and provided a rationale for ITε dependence on both layer thickness and raster angle . 
Additionally , the micromechanical model developed can be used to explain bonding limitations in MatEx based on road and bond geometry . 
Material anisotropy model formulation for the full three dimensional space . 
Efficient optimization of lattice structures with respect to material anisotropy . 
Effects of the material anisotropy on lightweight lattice structures . 
Finding the optimized build orientation with respect to the material anisotropy . 
Large increase in accuracy , hence , safety compared to conventional approaches . 
The build orientation is one the most influential factors on material properties in additively manufactured parts . 
Advanced applications , such as lattice structures optimized for lightweight , often rely on small safety margins and are , hence , particularly affected , but research has not gone far beyond the pure empirical characterization . 
The focus of this paper is to investigate in detail the influence of anisotropy induced through fabrication on the mechanical performance and build orientation of whole structures when subject to optimization . 
First , a material property model for both compression and tension states is formulated . 
Then , the Generalized Optimality Criteria method is extended for fixed topology lattice structures with respect to constraints in displacement , stress , and Euler buckling . 
The two latter are formulated as local constraints that are handled in combination with Fully-Stressed Design recursion . 
The results reveal significant safety threads likely leading to premature failure when using properties from one-directional tests , as is so far the case , rather than the full anisotropy model developed herein . 
If used inversely , the algorithm yields the optimal orientation of a structure on the build platform , allowing further weight reduction while maintaining the mechanical properties . 
Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) facilitates the formation of complex , stochastic or non-stochastic , metallic cellular structures . 
There is a high level of interest in these structures recently , particularly due to their high strength to weight ratios and osteoconductive properties . 
While the ability to in-situ monitor the SLM process is of key importance for future quality control methods.In this work lattice structures were fabricated , using the single exposure scanning strategy , on a Renishaw 500M SLM machine . 
The build process was also monitored using a co-axial in-situ process monitoring system.It was found that by increasing the energy input , through increasing the laser power and/or exposure time , the lattice strut diameters , within the 1.5 mm diamond unit cells , increased from 119 to 293 μm , resulting in the major pore diameter decreasing from 1106 to 932 μm . 
The effect of systematically altering the laser beam spot size on the cellular structures was also evaluated . 
It was observed that by doubling the laser beam spot size , that there was a 17 % reduction in strut diameter and a 22 % reduction in mechanical strength of the structures . 
It was also observed that at constant energy input levels , the lattice structures created using a focused laser exhibited an 81 % lower mechanical strength than the structures created using a de-focused laser . 
Thus , demonstrating that the mode of energy input is critical to achieving the desired strength in these structures.Based on the outputs from the in-situ monitoring system , a broadly linear correlation was obtained between the laser input energy , the associated process monitoring data generated and the mechanical strength of the lattice structures . 
Elevated heat-treatment temperatures increased mechanical properties . 
Long heat-treatment times decreased ductility and Young ’ s modulus . 
All elevated temperature heat-treatments yielded similar percent crystallinity . 
Increasing print and heat-treatment temperature increased inter-road bonding . 
Post-processing heat-treatments increased mechanical properties of printed parts . 
Material extrusion additive manufacturing ( MEAM ) and other additive manufacturing methods provide part design options that would be difficult or impossible to realize with conventional manufacturing methods . 
However , the mechanical properties of parts produced with MEAM are lower than bulk material properties because of the interfaces between roads and layers inherent to the additive build technique of MEAM . 
The effects of material dependent MEAM process parameters on the interlayer bonding and percent crystallinity of MEAM parts fabricated with polyphenylene sulfide ( PPS ) were examined in this study using a design of experiments technique known as the Taguchi method . 
The MEAM parameters studied were print temperature , heat-treatment time , and heat-treatment temperature . 
Heat-treatment temperature was shown to be the most influential parameter on all the studied properties . 
Utilizing heat-treatments on MEAM parts increased the ultimate tensile strength ( UTS ) from 52 % of the PPS film UTS to 80 % . 
The study showed that utilizing post-processing heat-treatments on MEAM parts could improve the interlayer bonding in these parts . 
Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene ( UHMWPE ) is a semi-crystalline polymer that has remarkable properties of high mechanical properties , excellent wear resistance , low friction and chemical resistance , and it is found in many applications such sporting goods , medical artificial joints , bullet proof jackets and armours , ropes and fishing lines [ 1 ] . 
UHMWPE parts can not be produced easily by many conventional processes because of its very high melt viscosity resulting from its very long chains [ 2 ] . 
Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) is moving from being an industrial rapid prototyping process to becoming a mainstream manufacturing process in a wide range of applications . 
Laser sintering of polymers is one of the AM techniques that is most promising process owing to its ability to produce parts with complex geometries , accurate dimensions , and good mechanical strength [ 3 ] . 
This paper reports attempts to laser-sinter UHMWPE and assesses the effects of laser energy density on the flexural properties of the sintered parts . 
The properties of the UHMWPE sintered parts were evaluated by performing flexural three point bending tests and were compared in terms of flexural strength , flexural modulus and ductility ( deflection ) . 
Part dimensions and relative density were evaluated in order to optimise the laser sintering parameters . 
Thermal analysis of samples was made by differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) for the virgin powder . 
Results show that flexural strength , modulus and ductility are influenced by laser energy density and flexural strength and modulus of 1.37 MPa and 32.12 MPa respectively are still achievable at a lower laser energy density of 0.016 J/mm2 ( Laser power of 6 W ) . 
Part dimensions and bulk density are also influenced by laser energy density . 
γ-Fe phase increase with the increasing SS316L content . 
The increase of SS316L content improves general and pitting corrosion resistance . 
Graded material with SS316L content ≥50 wt. 
% still has relatively high microhardness . 
Graded material with SS316L content ≥50 wt. 
% has lower pitting susceptibility . 
Composition-graded materials could be designed to rapidly establish the structure-property with high-throughput methods . 
In this study , stainless steel 316L ( SS316L ) - 431 ( SS431 ) graded material with the SS316L content ranging from 0 to 100 wt. 
% was fabricated by directed energy deposition additive manufacturing . 
Composition , phase constitution , microstructure and corrosion behavior of the graded material were characterized by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy ( LIBS ) , micro-beam X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) and high-throughput local electrochemical techniques respectively . 
Accordingly , the dominant microstructure varies from equiaxed dendrites to a mixture of dendritic and cellular structures . 
As the content of SS316L increases , the reduced carbides at grain boundaries and the increasing compactness of passive film improve the general and pitting corrosion resistance of the material . 
Such a high-throughput screening process allows one to reliably select the constituents with the presence of SS316L over 50 wt. 
% as a potential component under the requirement of high corrosion resistance and wear resistance . 
Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) is an additive manufacturing ( AM ) method that relies on the thermal extrusion of a thermoplastic feedstock from a mobile deposition head . 
Conventional FFF constructs components from stacks of individual extruded layers using tool paths with fixed z-values in each individual layer . 
Consequently , the manufactured components often contain inherent weaknesses in the z-axis due to the relatively weak thermal fusion bonding that occurs between individual layers , as well as poor surface finish in shallow sloped contours . 
This study demonstrates the use of Curved Layer FFF ( CLFFF ) tool paths in tandem with a commercially available parallel , or delta , style FFF system to allow the deposition head to follow the topology of the component . 
By incorporating a delta robot and CLFFF tool paths in this way , improvements in the surface finish of the manufactured parts has been observed , and time costs associated with Cartesian robot based CLFFF manufacturing have been notably reduced . 
Furthermore , employing a delta robot provides additional flexibility to CLFFF manufacturing and increases the feasibility of its application for advanced manufacturing . 
The study has also demonstrated a viable approach to multi-material FFF by decoupling support structure and part manufacture into regions of CLFFF and static z tool pathing in an appropriate fashion . 
Reducing the relative quality of lattice materials is a key factor in expanding their scope of application . 
Experimental samples of Ti6Al4V , including both VPOS and a body-centered cubic ( BCC ) octahedral model , are prepared by selective laser melting ( SLM ) . 
The influence of pose ( θ ) on the relative density of the lattice structures is evaluated analytically . 
The mechanical response and specific energy absorption ( SEA ) of these structures under compression are investigated . 
Compared with the experimental BCC data , the relative density of the VPOS samples is reduced , and their SEA values are improved . 
The mechanical properties of the VPOSs in the z and y directions are optimized when θ=43° . 
When θ = 10° , the z-direction SEA is maximum ( ∼2.4 times the BCC value ) . 
Among the various Ti6Al4V octahedral lattice structures , the structure with θ = 43° exhibits the best mechanical properties at unit density . 
This study demonstrates that the performance of lattice structures can be improved to different degrees by varying the unit cell pose . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) has gone through major developments in the past decade , enabling the rapid manufacture of complex geometries from traditional engineering materials . 
This study aims to facilitate the development and additive manufacturing of a new generation of fast and simple digital components with integrated magnetic shape memory ( MSM ) alloy sections that can be actuated by an external magnetic field . 
Here , we employ a systematic design of experiments ( DoE ) approach for investigating laser powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) of a Ni-Mn-Ga based MSM alloy . 
The effects of the applied process parameters on the chemical composition and relative density are determined , and detailed investigations are conducted on the microstructural properties of the as-deposited material obtained using optimized parameters . 
The results show that although the L-PBF of Ni-Mn-Ga is characterized by an ever-present loss of Mn , deposition of Ni-Mn-Ga with a high relative density of 98.3 % and a minimal loss of Mn at ∼1.1 at. 
% is feasible . 
However , combined measurements by the low-field ac magnetic susceptibility method ( LFMS ) and DSC revealed that the phase transformation of the as-deposited material from martensite to austenite , and vice versa , was broad and occurred in a paramagnetic state . 
Inspection by SEM revealed a layered microstructure with a stripe-like surface relief that originated from the presence of martensitic twins within the sample . 
Overall , L-PBF shows high potential for the production of functional Ni-Mn-Ga based MSM alloys . 
Fabricated Schwarz P unit cell-based scaffolds underwent geometrical transformations in the form of shrinkage . 
Computational effective modulus of the original Schwarz P unit cell under-estimated the experimental modulus by 86.05 % . 
Computational effective modulus of the reconstructed unit cell over-estimated the experimental modulus by 6.94 % . 
Micromechanical analysis was able to accommodate geometrical transformations of the Schwarz P unit cell . 
Schwarz P unit cell-based tissue scaffolds comprised of poly ( D , L-lactide-co- ε -caprolactone ) ( PLCL ) fabricated via the additive manufacturing technique , two-photon polymerisation ( 2PP ) were found to undergo geometrical transformations from the original input design . 
A Schwarz P unit cell surface geometry CAD model was reconstructed to take into account the geometrical transformations through CAD modeling techniques using measurements obtained from an image-based averaging technique before its implementation for micromechanical analysis . 
Effective modulus results obtained from computational mechanical characterization via micromechanical analysis of the reconstructed unit cell assigned with the same material model making up the fabricated scaffolds demonstrated excellent agreement with a small margin of error at 6.94 % from the experimental mean modulus ( 0.69 ± 0.29 MPa ) . 
The inter-relationships between different dimensional parameters making up the Schwarz P architecture and resulting effective modulus are also assessed and discussed . 
With the ability to accommodate the geometrical transformations , maintain efficiency in terms of time and computational resources , micromechanical analysis has the potential to be implemented in tissue scaffolds with a periodic microstructure as well as other structures outside the field of tissue engineering in general . 
Nanoparticle-enhanced Al 7075 can be used to make crack-free welds , overlays , and multi-layer parts via arc welding . 
Hardness of deposited nanoparticle-enhanced Al 7075 weld material return to that of parent alloy after T73 heat treatment . 
Post-weld T73 heat treatment of nanoparticle-enhanced Al 7075 results in tensile properties indiscernible from parent alloy . 
Aluminum alloy 7075 ( Al 7075 ) with a T73 heat treatment is commonly used in aerospace applications due to exceptional specific strength properties . 
Challenges with manufacturing the material from the melt has previously limited the processing of Al 7075 via welding , casting , and additive manufacturing . 
Recent research has shown the capabilities of nanoparticle additives to control the solidification behavior of high-strength aluminum alloys , showcasing the first Al 7075 components processed via casting , welding , and AM . 
In this work , the properties of nanoparticle-enhanced aluminum 7075 are investigated on welded parts , overlays and through wire-based additive manufacturing . 
The hardness and tensile strength of the deposited materials were measured in the as-welded and T73 heat-treated conditions showing that the properties of Al 7075 T73 can be recovered in welded and layer-deposited parts . 
The work shows that Al 7075 now has the potential to be conventionally welded or additively manufactured from wire into high-strength , crack-free parts . 
The dissimilar resistance spot welding of additively manufactured steel to conventional automotive steel has attracted significant attention from automotive manufacturer . 
However , the mechanical properties of dissimilar spot welds could be affected by the printed properties of additively manufactured steels , limiting the further application of 3D printing process in auto-body assembly line . 
This paper proposed an approach to improve the mechanical properties of spot-welded joints of additive manufactured steels by the design of binder jetting printed steels with the addition of nanoparticles . 
Cu-Sn nanoparticles have been injected to the stainless steel via binder jetting process , aiming to fill the voids between steel particles and reduce the microstructure heterogeneity in the spot welds . 
The microstructure evolution , sintering behavior of nanoparticles and mechanical properties of resistance spot welded stainless steel were characterized and analyzed . 
The sintering behavior of Cu-Sn nanoparticles during welding process attributes to the formation of transition zone with homogenous microstructure , resulting to the improvement of hardness property and lap-shear strength of spot-welded joints . 
Compared to the spot welds of selective laser melting printed stainless steels , the resistance spot welded stainless steel via binder jetting process shows better mechanical properties with 48 % increase of energy absorption and 19 % increase of peak load . 
Additively manufactured plates are successfully joined using FSW for the first time . 
Weld microstructure consists of ( α + β ) phase and very fine equiaxed α grain with a refined β phase at the grain boundary . 
The tensile strength of the FSW is nearly equal to the base material at a relatively higher tool rotation speed . 
Significant tool wear is observed at lower tool rotation speeds , resulting in lower weld strength . 
Additive manufacturing of titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4 V has significantly increased over the past few years , primarily due to its broad application over the conventional manufacturing process for complex and near net shape production . 
We study the feasibility of friction stir welding of Ti-6Al-4 V plates made by electron beam melting , performing both microstructural and mechanical analysis . 
Microstructures for all the welds reveal lamellar ( α + β ) phase and very fine equiaxed α grain with the prior β phase at grain boundaries in the stirred zone . 
Microhardness at different depths of the joint is measured and the strength of the joint is determined using a tensile test . 
The results obtained prove the feasibility of the process and provide the necessary processing conditions . 
The Additive manufacturing technologies familiarize many innovative and monetary gains when compared to conservative subtractive manufacturing methods in rapid prototyping ( RP ) and small production capacity . 
In other exceedingly industrialized fields including aerospace , automobile , and bio-medical industries , additive manufacturing has turned out to be a subject of high interest . 
Nowadays , Additive manufacturing ( AM ) of Titanium alloys has grown into an imperative field of study . 
The foremost prominence of Titanium alloys is excellent strength to weight ratio , high weathering resistance , and admirable characteristics involving high tensile strength and toughness with comparatively low electrical and thermal conductivity . 
The manufacturing of Titanium through AM technology is marginally expensive and durable as it enables to create freedom in design community to fabricate user defined and complex structures which is hard to produce through other conventional manufacturing methods . 
The Ti-6Al-4V alloy is popularly known as the “ work horse ” of titanium is comprehensively used in aerospace and biomedical industries . 
At present , several studies have focused on hybrid manufacturing and enhancing the mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V with additive manufacturing techniques . 
In this research work , a short review on additive manufacturing of Ti-6Al-4V alloys has been investigated to define its mechanical and metallurgical properties in both as-built and heat treated conditions . 
Using tungsten inert gas welding , a simple technique to additively construct single-channel multilayer Ti alloy ( Ti-6Al-4V ) was developed . 
In the manufacturing process , the flow rate of nitrogen is used to control the microstructure and composition of each individual layer . 
The use of nitrogen leads to the formation of TiN particles , whose amount increases with the flow rate of nitrogen . 
There is no significant difference in the elastic moduli among individual layers . 
Increasing the flow rate of nitrogen results in an increase in the compression strength of the individual layers and a decrease in the ductility of individual layers . 
The Vickers hardness increases gradually from 300 to 400 HV for the base metal to ∼1000 HV for the top layer of the Ti alloy , and the compressive strength of the Ti alloy reaches 1.92 GPa at a 1.5 L/min nitrogen flow rate . 
The technique developed in this work provides a feasible route to additively construct single-channel multilayer structures with spatial distributions of the composition and microstructures . 
Direct observation of pore formation dynamics during LPBF additive manufacturing . 
Revealed three new pore formation mechanisms . 
Reconfirmed three previously studied pore formation mechanisms Laser powder bed fusion ( LPBF ) is a 3D printing technology that can print parts with complex geometries that are unachievable by conventional manufacturing technologies . 
However , pores formed during the printing process impair the mechanical performance of the printed parts , severely hindering their widespread application . 
Here , we report six pore formation mechanisms that were observed during the LPBF process . 
Our results reconfirm three pore formation mechanisms - keyhole induced pores , pore formation from feedstock powder and pore formation along the melting boundary during laser melting from vaporization of a volatile substance or an expansion of a tiny trapped gas . 
We also observe three new pore formation mechanisms : ( 1 ) pore trapped by surface fluctuation , ( 2 ) pore formation due to depression zone fluctuation when the depression zone is shallow and ( 3 ) pore formation from a crack . 
The results presented here provide direct evidence and insight into pore formation mechanisms during the LPBF process , which may guide the development of pore elimination/mitigation approaches . 
Since certain laser processing conditions studied here are similar to the situations in high energy density laser welding , the results presented here also have implications for laser welding . 
The processes of ultrasonic spot welding and ultrasonic additive manufacturing are modelled by approximating the weld interface as rough metallic surfaces in sliding contact . 
It is assumed that bonding is due to athermal plastic deformation of surface asperities and the associated growth of metallic junctions along the weld interface . 
To link the process variables and the extent of junction growth , an expression for the real contact area at the weld interface is combined with process-specific frictional heating models developed here . 
The resulting framework is validated by comparing its predictions of the weld strength with data from the ultrasonic welding literature . 
The close agreement between the framework 's predictions and the experimental data demonstrates that the surface asperities soften due to frictional heating , while acoustic softening effects are insignificant . 
The junction growth model is used to identify parameter sets for ultrasonic spot welding and ultrasonic additive manufacturing that maximize the weld strength while simultaneously minimizing the thermal excursion at the weld interface . 
It is found that in ultrasonic spot welding , certain processing conditions can cause interfacial melting , although melting is not required to form strong bonds . 
It is also shown that in ultrasonic additive manufacturing , the deposition rate is highest when the positions of the peak temperature and complete interfacial bonding coincide underneath the sonotrode . 
If the position of complete interfacial bonding leads the position of the peak temperature , there is excessive heating of the build , and the sonotrode velocity can be increased without degrading bond quality . 
Although Additive Manufacturing implementation is rapidly growing , industrial sectors are demanding an increase of manufactured part size which most extended processes , such as Selective Laser Melting ( SLM ) or Laser Metal Deposition ( LMD ) , are not able to offer . 
In this sense , Wire-Arc Additive Manufacturing ( WAAM ) offers high deposition rates and quality without size limits , becoming the best alternative for additive manufacturing of medium-large size parts with high mechanical requirements such as structural parts in the aeronautical industry.WAAM technology adds material in form of wire using an arc welding process in order to melt both the wire and the substrate . 
There are three welding processes that are mainly used in WAAM : Plasma Arc Welding ( PAW ) , Gas Tungsten Arc Welding ( GTAW or TIG ) and Gas Metal Arc Welding ( GMAW or MIG ) . 
This paper studies these processes regarding on their capabilities for additive manufacturing and compares the mechanical properties obtained by the different welding technologies applied in WAAM . 
Obtained results show the applicability of the technology as an alternative of traditional metallic preforms manufacturing processes , such as casting or forging . 
A weak coupling modeling method is developed for arc welding based additive manufacturing . 
This weak coupling modeling method is capable of simulating the complex heat and mass transfer effectively and efficiently . 
In arc welding based additive manufacturing , the surface topographies of deposited layer are more complex than conventional welding , therefore , the distribution of the electromagnetic force in molten pool , arc pressure , plasma shear stress and heat flux on molten pool surface are not the same as the conventional welding . 
A three-dimensional weak coupling modeling method of the arc and metal transport is developed to simulate the arc , molten pool dynamic and droplet impingement in arc welding based additive manufacturing . 
In the arc model , the molten pool is simplified to be solid state on the basis of experimentally observed results . 
The arc is simulated firstly , and then the electromagnetic force , arc pressure , plasma shear stress and heat flux are extracted and transmitted to metal transport model . 
The volume of fluid ( VOF ) method is employed to track free surface of molten pool and droplet , and the continuum surface force ( CSF ) method is applied to transform all the surface forces on free surface as localized body forces . 
This weak coupling model has better accuracy than empirical model and decreases computational consumption . 
The molten pool morphology and cross-sectional profile of simulated results accord well with experimental results in both single-bead deposition and overlapping deposition , which indicates that this weak coupling modeling method is capable of simulating the complex heat and mass transfer phenomena in arc welding based additive manufacturing . 
Laser additive manufacturing is an advanced , very perspective technology with potentially wide industrial applications , one of them being an improvement of durability of forms and dies . 
The aim is to improve surface properties like wear resistance using special layers of powder sintered or remelted by laser beam . 
At present , dies are manufactured by machining with following bulk heat treatment , which is an expensive process . 
Concerning repairs of dies , they are usually performed manually , using arc or plasma welding with numerous difficulties and disadvantages in comparison with promising and advanced laser overlaying . 
The paper contains results of a comprehensive evaluation of several types of hard overlayed powder of H13 tool steel on a S355 structural steel using laser beam . 
Properties like macro- and microstructure , mechanical properties like hardness and its course in the layers , high-cycle fatigue resistance in bending and fatigue damage mechanisms were investigated with the emphasis on fatigue crack initiation process evaluated using scanning electron microscopy . 
The results indicated that surface additive laser welded layers of a high quality can be reached . 
On the other hand , some drop of fatigue resistance and endurance limit was observed , affected by surface defects – small welding imperfections Ti-6Al-4V and AlSi5 wires were used for wire and arc additive manufacturing using the direct current cold metal transfer welding . 
Ti alloy was deposited first , and then Al alloy was deposited on the Ti layer . 
A small amount of Ti alloy was melted when the first layer of Al alloy was deposited due to the low heat input . 
A component composed of Ti/Al dissimilar alloys can be produced . 
The interface layer between the Ti and Al alloys included a continuous layer and a discontinuous layer . 
The continuous layer was composed of Ti7Al5Si12 , and the discontinuous layer consisted of Ti ( Al1-xSix ) 3 . 
Element Si was rich in the continuous layer . 
The hardness and modulus of the interface layer were between those of Al and Ti alloys . 
The average tensile strength of the component was 79 MPa . 
The fracture located at the interface layer . 
A finite element model is developed to calculate the heat propagation of a circular thin-walled component fabricated in gas metal arc welding based additive manufacturing . 
The heat evolution , thermal cycle feature , and temperature gradient in molten pool and deposited layers are revealed . 
The temperature simulations at some locations are in agreement with measured values from thermocouples . 
As the deposition process proceeds , the high-temperature regions of the substrate and molten pool increase . 
The temperature gradient in the molten pool decreases with the increasing deposition height . 
The heat dissipation condition in the molten pool of current layer tightly depends on the deposition direction of fore layer . 
At the deposition ending moment , the heat conduction in the axial direction is the predominant heat dissipation orientation , whereas the circumferential orientation becomes the main heat dissipation direction in the top layers . 
An automated arc-welding-based additive manufacturing system was reported . 
Integrated additive and subtractive manufacturing methodology was developed . 
Deposition paths and welding parameters were automatically generated . 
User interface using only CAD models as inputs was developed . 
Arc welding has been widely explored for additive manufacturing of large metal components over the last three decades due to its lower capital cost , an unlimited build envelope , and higher deposition rates . 
Although significant improvements have been made , an arc welding process has yet to be incorporated in a commercially available additive manufacturing system . 
The next step in exploiting “ true ” arc-welding-based additive manufacturing is to develop the automation software required to produce CAD-to-part capability . 
This study focuses on developing a fully automated system using robotic gas metal arc welding to additively manufacture metal components . 
The system contains several modules , including bead modelling , slicing , deposition path planning , weld setting , and post-process machining . 
Among these modules , bead modelling provides the essential database for process control , and an innovative path planning strategy fulfils the requirements of the automated system . 
Finally , a thin-walled aluminium structure has been fabricated automatically using only a CAD model as the informational input to the system . 
This exercise demonstrates that the developed system is a significant contribution towards the ultimate goal of producing a practical and highly automated arc-welding-based additive manufacturing system for industrial application . 
Laser additive manufacturing titanium alloy 40 mm thick plate can obtain full penetration joint by EBW . 
In fusion zone , due to acicular α′ formation , the microhardness is higher than base metal and heat affected zone . 
All tensile samples fail in base metal . 
The L-joint shows higher strength but lower ductility than T-joint . 
Individually fabrication parts by laser additive manufacturing ( LAM ) and then jointing them together through electron beam welding ( EBW ) is a viable way for manufacturing large components with reduction of internal stress . 
For investigating the microstructure and mechanical property of EBW joint along longitudinal and transverse direction in LAMed component , two LAMed Ti–6.5Al–3.5Mo–1.5Zr–0.3Si plates were successfully welded without defects . 
Results show that the microstructure of base metal ( BM ) is a typical basket-weave morphology that exhibits lamellar α within β matrix . 
In heat affected zone ( HAZ ) , the part of primary α transforms to β with the some very fine lamellar αs precipitates out . 
Due to the fast solidification rate , a large number of acicular α′ forms in fusion zone ( FZ ) , leading to the highest microhardness . 
All tensile samples fail in BM region with the fracture type of intergranular dimpled fracture . 
Compared with the T-joint , the L-joint shows higher ultimate tensile strength and yield strength , but lower elongation and reduction of area due to the morphology of columnar grains and the strong texture of β < 010 > parallel to the deposition direction . 
In Laser-based Manufacturing , the configuration of process parameters aims to maintain quality measures within specific boundaries and it is obtained through experimentation . 
The idea developed and presented in this paper concerns the prediction of the performance of adaptive control policies , based on process modeling . 
Two examples of Laser-based Manufacturing are deployed in order to verify the response of adaptive control algorithms through empirical design , Laser welding and Laser-based Additive Manufacturing processes . 
The penetration depth has been utilized as the quality criterion of the adaptive control loop for both processes . 
The solidification phase has also been examined . 
Dissolved oxygen in weld zone leads to distinct microstructures from base metal after annealing . 
The repaired specimens have lower plasticity and slightly higher strength than base metal . 
Columnar grain boundary α phases in weld zone are the earliest microcracks nucleation sites . 
Gas tungsten arc welding was used to repair the laser additive manufactured Ti-5Al-5Mo-5V-1Cr-1Fe ( Ti-55511 ) alloy with a subsequent triplex annealing treatment . 
The tensile properties of heat treated specimens containing of different proportions of weld zone were designed to evaluate the influence of weld zone on tensile properties of the alloy . 
Microstructures , microhardness and tensile tests were performed to study the mechanical properties and fracture behaviors of the specimens . 
Results show that dissolved oxygen in the weld zone has a strong influence on increasing the number of α phase nucleation sites that can lead to different αp morphologies in the base metal and weld zone . 
These different αp can lead to distinct microstructures after triplex annealing treatment but with similar α volume fractions . 
Besides , plasticity deterioration of the repaired tensile specimens is mainly attributed to the formation of columnar grain boundary α phases in the weld zone which are considered to be the earliest nucleation sites of microcracks and confirmed by in situ tensile test . 
With the increase of WZ proportions in the cross section of tensile specimens , the plasticity of the alloy gradually decreases . 
Ultrasonic additive manufacturing ( UAM ) is a solid-state additive manufacturing technique employing principles of ultrasonic welding coupled with mechanized tape layering to fabricate fully functional parts . 
However , parts fabricated using UAM often exhibit a reduction in strength levels when loaded normal to the welding interfaces ( Z-direction ) . 
In this work , the effect of post-weld heat treatments ( PWHT ) on Al-6061 builds fabricated using the UAM process was explored aiming to improve the mechanical strength of the UAM builds . 
Tensile testing with digital image correlation ( DIC ) coupled with metallography along with multi-scale structure characterization ( SEM-EBSD ) was used to investigate and rationalize the mechanical performance of the UAM builds . 
It was established that PWHTs may improve the Z-strength level by the factor of ~3÷3.5 ( from ~46 to 177 MPa ) . 
The improvements in the strength level were primarily aided by material aging and grain growth across the bond interface . 
Ultrasonic additive manufacturing ( UAM ) is a solid-state additive manufacturing process that uses fundamental principles of ultrasonic welding and sequential layering of tapes to fabricate complex three-dimensional ( 3-D ) components . 
One of the factors limiting the use of this technology is the poor tensile strength along the z-axis . 
Recent work has demonstrated the improvement of the z-axis properties after post-processing treatments . 
The abnormally high stability of the grains at the interface during post-weld heat treatments is , however , not yet well understood . 
In this work we use multiscale characterization to understand the stability of the grains during post-weld heat treatments . 
Aluminum alloy ( 6061 ) builds , fabricated using ultrasonic additive manufacturing , were post-weld heat treated at 180 , 330 and 580 °C . 
The grains close to the tape interfaces are stable during post-weld heat treatments at high temperatures ( i.e. 
, 580 °C ) . 
This is in contrast to rapid grain growth that takes place in the bulk . 
Transmission electron microscopy and atom-probe tomography display a significant enrichment of oxygen and magnesium near the stable interfaces . 
Based on the detailed characterization , two mechanisms are proposed and evaluated : nonequilibrium nano-dispersed oxides impeding the grain growth due to grain boundary pinning , or grain boundary segregation of magnesium and oxygen reducing the grain boundary energy . 
Additive manufacturing will be an option to develop prototypes or mechanical parts that will be made faster and cheaper than other techniques such as laser cladding or electron beam . 
The main objective of this research was to study the optimal initial conditions of the proposed additive manufacturing system in order to obtain metal prototypes . 
This optimal conditions have been presented taking into account the measurements of geometrical conditions and surface finishing . 
The proposed additive manufacturing system consist on an integration of a Fronius TPS 4000 CMT R welding machine with a BF30 Vario Optimun CNC milling machine . 
Once the material was selected , the optimal conditions to make the first layer have been obtained . 
Previous simple geometries , such as prismatic and cylindrical parts have been manufactured . 
Efficient way of depositing thin-walled overhang features , without supports , based on inclined slicing and weld-deposition . 
Uses higher order kinematics to the work piece for fabricating complex thin-walled fully dense functional metallic parts . 
Geometrical modelling of the weld-bead to predict the layer thickness of a given layer for bead-on-bead deposition . 
In-house MATLAB code to slice the CAD model and generate the tool path for inclined deposition of a given layer . 
Fabrication of complex thin-walled parts using GMAW based weld-deposition for illustration of above mentioned concepts . 
Gas Metal Arc Welding ( GMAW ) based weld-deposition process is one of the deposition-based Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) processes with the ability to produce fully dense complex functional metallic objects . 
Due to its high deposition rates , high material and power efficiency , lower investment costs , simpler setup and work environment requirements it is slowly becoming a viable metallic AM method . 
Amongst various geometrical features that can be realized in weld-deposition based AM , the thin-walled features ( i.e. 
, features with one single deposition pass ) are the toughest as the process has to overcome the bead-over-bead complexity . 
Based on geometric modelling and experimentation , this paper presents an efficient technique for producing the thin-walled metallic structures , including objects with undercut features . 
This is possible by adding extra degrees of freedom or by using higher order kinematics to the work piece and/or to the deposition head by suitably aligning the overhanging feature in-line to the deposition direction . 
An in-house MATLAB code was developed to slice the CAD model and generate the tool path for inclined deposition of a given layer of a thin-walled model . 
A geometrical model proposed to predict the layer thickness of a given layer during such bead-on-bead deposition showed good correlation with experimental data . 
Some illustrative complex thin-walled components successfully fabricated using this model have also been presented . 
Additive layer manufacturing ( ALM ) , using gas tungsten arc welding ( GTAW ) as heat source , is a promising technology in producing Inconel 625 components due to significant cost savings , high deposition rate and convenience of processing . 
With the purpose of revealing how microstructure and mechanical properties are affected by the location within the manufactured wall component , the present study has been carried out . 
The manufactured Inconel 625 consists of cellular grains without secondary dendrites in the near-substrate region , columnar dendrites structure oriented upwards in the layer bands , followed by the transition from directional dendrites to equiaxed grain in the top region . 
With the increase in deposited height , segregation behavior of alloying elements Nb and Mo constantly strengthens with maximal evolution in the top region . 
The primary dendrite arm spacing has a well coherence with the content of Laves phase . 
The microhardness and tensile strength show obvious variation in different regions . 
The microhardness and tensile strength of near-substrate region are superior to that of layer bands and top region . 
The results are further explained in detail through the weld pool behavior and temperature field measurement . 
This paper describes results of seam welding of relatively high temperature melting materials , AISI 304 , C-Mn steels , Ni-based alloys , CP Cu , CP Ni , Ti6Al4V and relatively low temperature melting material , AA6061 . 
It describes the seam welding of multi-layered similar and dissimilar metallic sheets . 
The method described and involved advancing a rotating non-consumable rod ( CP Mo or AISI 304 ) toward the upper sheet of a metallic stack clamped under pressure . 
As soon as the distal end of the rod touched the top portion of the upper metallic sheet , an axial force was applied . 
After an initial dwell time , the metallic stack moved horizontally relative to the stationery non-consumable rod by a desired length , thereby forming a metallurgical bond between the metallic sheets . 
Multi-track and multi-metal seam welds of high temperature metallic sheets , AISI 304 , C-Mn steel , Nickel-based alloys , Cp Cu , Ti6Al4V and low temperature metallic sheets , AA6061 were obtained . 
Optical and scanning electron microscopy examination and 180 degree U-bend test indicated that defect free seam welds could be obtained with this method . 
Tensile- shear testing showed that the seam welds of AISI 304 , C-Mn steel , Nickel-based alloy were stronger than the starting base metal counterparts while AA6061 was weaker due to softening . 
The metallurgical bonding at the interface between the metallic sheets was attributed to localized stick and slip at the interface , dynamic recrystallization and diffusion . 
The method developed can be used as a means of welding , cladding and additive manufacturing . 
In this paper the joinability of titanium Additive Manufactured ( AM ) parts is explored . 
Keyhole welding , using a pulsed laser beam , of conventionally produced parts is compared to AM parts . 
Metal AM parts are notorious for having remaining porosities and other non-isotropic properties due to the layered manufacturing process . 
This study shows that due to these deficiencies more energy per unit weld length is required to obtain a similar keyhole geometry for titanium AM parts . 
It is also demonstrated that , with adjusted laser process parameters , good quality welds for aerospace applications in terms of pressure resistance and leak tightness are achievable . 
Part size in additive manufacturing is limited by the size of building area of AM equipment . 
Occasionally , larger constructions that AM machines are able to produce , are needed , and this creates demand for welding AM parts together . 
However there is very little information on welding of additive manufactured stainless steels . 
The aim of this study was to investigate the weldability aspects of AM material . 
In this study , comparison of the bead on plate welds between AM parts and sheet metal parts is done.Used material was 316L stainless steel , AM and sheet metal , and parts were welded with laser welding . 
Weld quality was evaluated visually from macroscopic images . 
Results show that there are certain differences in the welds in AM parts compared to the welds in sheet metal parts . 
Differences were found in penetration depths and in type of welding defects . 
Nevertheless , this study presents that laser welding is suitable process for welding AM parts . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) of high γ′ strengthened Nickel-base superalloys , such as IN738LC , is of high interest for applications in hot section components for gas turbines . 
The creep property acts as the critical indicator of component performance under load at elevated temperature . 
In order to evaluate the short-term creep behavior , slow strain rate tensile ( SSRT ) tests were performed . 
IN738LC bars were built by laser powder-bed-fusion ( L-PBF ) and then subjected to hot isostatic pressing ( HIP ) followed by the standard two-step heat treatment . 
The samples were subjected to SSRT testing at 850 °C under strain rates of 1 × 10−5/s , 1 × 10−6/s , and 1 × 10−7/s . 
In this research , the underlying creep deformation mechanism of AM processed IN738LC is investigated using the serial sectioning technique , electron backscatter diffraction ( EBSD ) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . 
On the creep mechanism of AM polycrystalline IN738LC , grain boundary sliding is predominant . 
However , due to the interlock feature of grain boundaries in AM processed IN738LC , the grain structure retains its integrity after deformation . 
The dislocation motion acts as the major accommodation process of grain boundary sliding . 
Dislocations bypass the γ′ precipitates by Orowan looping and wavy slip . 
The rearrangement of screw dislocations is responsible for the formation of subgrains within the grain interior . 
This research elucidates the short-creep behavior of AM processed IN738LC . 
It also shed new light on the creep deformation mechanism of additive manufactured γ′ strengthened polycrystalline Nickel-base superalloys . 
Due to the cost advantage , weld-based Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) is suitable for directly fabricating large metallic parts . 
One of challenges for weld-based Additive M anufacturing is to build overhanging structure or tilt structure at a large slant angle , because liquid metal on the boundary would flow down by gravity due to lack of sufficient support . 
In the present work , electromagnetically confined weld-based Additive Manufacturing is develop ed to solve this problem . 
In the process , liquid metal is confined and semi-levitated by the Lorentz force exerted by magnetic field and thus the flow of liquid metal is restricted . 
Experiments and numerical simulations are performed to investigate the effect mechanism of electromagnetic confinement . 
Experimental results verify that the flow-down or collapse of liquid metal is impeded by electromagnetic confinement . 
With specific welding parameters , the maximum tilt angle of successful building increases from 50° to 60° when imposing electromagnetic confinement . 
New technologies can be justified with the advent of the additive manufacturing , excels by its flexibility in manufacturing parts of various geometries , good accuracy and material waste reduction savings . 
This circumstance requires the application of techniques to determine the reliability of the results in the deposition of layers in order to have a good accuracy . 
This work aims to present a new technology applied to additive manufacturing , focusing on accuracy in the deposition of layers , lower cost and user friendliness man-machine . 
New method was proposed in order to obtain advantages regarding the use of Plasma welding process . 
An apparatus for generating plasma was used to obtain the arc . 
Correlated magnitudes helped in determining Efficient Model of Deposition for use in offsetting the geometric and thermal errors . 
Computer simulations were applied to the new concept of deposition and the efficiency of the presented system was performed , but no experimental results are provided herein . 
Ultrasonic additive manufacturing ( UAM ) is a solid-state hybrid manufacturing technique . 
In this work characterization using electron back scatter diffraction was performed on aluminum–titanium dissimilar metal welds made using a 9 kW ultrasonic additive manufacturing system . 
The results showed that the aluminum texture at the interface after ultrasonic additive manufacturing is similar to aluminum texture observed during accumulative roll bonding of aluminum alloys . 
It is finally concluded that the underlying mechanism of bond formation in ultrasonic additive manufacturing primarily relies on severe shear deformation at the interface . 
The wire arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) 2Cr13 thin-wall part was deposited using robotic cold metal transfer ( CMT ) technology , and the location-related thermal history , densification , phase identification , microstructure , and mechanical properties of the part were explored . 
The results show that pre-heating effect from previously built layers can be effectively used to reduce residual stresses ; cooling rate firstly decreased rapidly and then kept stable in the 15th–25th layers . 
The peaks of the α-Fe phase of the AM part drifted slightly toward a relatively smaller Bragg 's angle as a result of solute atoms incorporation when compared with that of the base metal . 
As-deposited microstructure consisted of martensite and ferrite , along with ( Fe , Cr ) 23C6 phase precipitated at α-Fe grain boundaries . 
Martensite content increased gradually from the 5th layer to the 25th layers , indicating that metastable martensite partly decomposed into stable ferrite due to the carbon atoms diffusion . 
The hardness and UTS changed slightly in the 05th–15th layers and then increased quickly from the 20th layer to the 25th layers at the expense of ductility ; the fracture process transformed from ductile ( 01st–10th layers ) to mixed-mode ( 15th–20th layers ) , and finally to brittle fracture ( 25th layer ) . 
The findings above suggest that , despite the emergency of few pores and slightly inadequate ductility , this robotic CMT technology is a feasible method to obtain desired microstructures and enhanced mechanical properties for the WAAM 2Cr13 part in comparison with its as-solutioned counterpart . 
An innovative and low cost additive layer manufacturing ( ALM ) process is used to produce γ-TiAl based alloy wall components . 
Gas tungsten arc welding ( GTAW ) provides the heat source for this new approach , combined with in-situ alloying through separate feeding of commercially pure Ti and Al wires into the weld pool . 
This paper investigates the morphology , microstructure and mechanical properties of the additively manufactured TiAl material , and how these are affected by the location within the manufactured component . 
The typical additively layer manufactured morphology exhibits epitaxial growth of columnar grains and several layer bands . 
The fabricated γ-TiAl based alloy consists of comparatively large α2 grains in the near-substrate region , fully lamellar colonies with various sizes and interdendritic γ structure in the intermediate layer bands , followed by fine dendrites and interdendritic γ phases in the top region . 
Microhardness measurements and tensile testing results indicated relatively homogeneous mechanical characteristics throughout the deposited material . 
The exception to this homogeneity occurs in the near-substrate region immediately adjacent to the pure Ti substrate used in these experiments , where the alloying process is not as well controlled as in the higher regions . 
The tensile properties are also different for the vertical ( build ) direction and horizontal ( travel ) direction because of the differing microstructure in each direction . 
The microstructure variation and strengthening mechanisms resulting from the new manufacturing approach are analysed in detail . 
The results demonstrate the potential to produce full density titanium aluminide components directly using the new additive layer manufacturing method . 
Amorphous polymer melt is extruded and deposited filament-by-filament . 
Non-isothermal inter-diffusion from an anisotropic configuration is modelled . 
Weld thickness ( ∼Rg ) is sufficient to achieve bulk mechanical strength at weld . 
Reduced weld strength is attributed to a partially entangled structure . 
Although 3D printing has the potential to transform manufacturing processes , the strength of printed parts often does not rival that of traditionally-manufactured parts . 
The fused-filament fabrication method involves melting a thermoplastic , followed by layer-by-layer extrusion of the molten viscoelastic material to fabricate a three-dimensional object . 
The strength of the welds between layers is controlled by interdiffusion and entanglement of the melt across the interface . 
However , diffusion slows down as the printed layer cools towards the glass transition temperature . 
Diffusion is also affected by high shear rates in the nozzle , which significantly deform and disentangle the polymer microstructure prior to welding . 
In this paper , we model non-isothermal polymer relaxation , entanglement recovery , and diffusion processes that occur post-extrusion to investigate the effects that typical printing conditions and amorphous ( non-crystalline ) polymer rheology have on the ultimate weld structure . 
Although we find the weld thickness to be of the order of the polymer size , the structure of the weld is anisotropic and relatively disentangled ; reduced mechanical strength at the weld is attributed to this lower degree of entanglement . 
The microstructures of Al alloy 6061 subjected to very-high-power ultrasonic additive manufacturing were systematically examined to understand the underlying ultrasonic welding mechanism . 
The microstructure of the weld interface between the metal tapes consisted of fine , equiaxed grains resulting from recrystallization , which is driven by simple shear deformation along the ultrasonically vibrating direction of the tape surface . 
Void formation at the weld interface is attributed to surface asperities resulting from pressure induced by the sonotrode at the initial tape deposition . 
Transmission electron microscopy revealed that Al–Al metallic bonding without surface oxide layers was mainly achieved , although some oxide clusters were locally observed at the original interface . 
The results suggest that the oxide layers were broken up and then locally clustered on the interface by ultrasonic vibration . 
A theoretical analysis of the metal transfer behaviour and bead shape formation using positional GMAW are provided . 
The effects of various process parameters on the stability of positional deposition are investigated . 
The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified by three complex samples using a positional GMAW-WAAM process . 
Robotic wire arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) technology has been widely employed to fabricate medium to large scale metallic components . 
It has the advantages of high deposition rates and low cost . 
Ideally , the deposition process is carried out in a flat position . 
The build direction is vertically upward and perpendicular to a horizontal worktable . 
However , it would be difficult to directly deposit complex parts with near horizontal ‘ overhangs ’ , and temporary supports may be required . 
Thus , it is necessary to find an alternative approach for the deposition of ‘ overhangs ’ without extra support in order to simplify the deposition set-up . 
This paper proposed a fabrication method of producing metallic parts with overhanging structures using the multi-directional wire arc additive manufacturing . 
Firstly , based on the metal droplet kinetics and weld bead geometry , two different Gas Metal Arc Welding ( GMAW ) metal transfer modes , namely short circuit transfer and free flight transfer , were evaluated for the multi-directional wire arc additive manufacturing . 
Subsequently , the effects of process parameters , including wire feed speed ( WFS ) , torch travel speed ( TS ) , nozzle to work distance ( NTWD ) and torch angle , on the stability of positional deposition were investigated . 
Finally , the effectiveness of the proposed strategy was verified by fabricating three complex samples with overhangs .

Comparison between laser welding and laser-based additive manufacturing parameters is established . 
Major process parameters during laser-based additive manufacturing and their influence are discussed . 
Remedies for avoid several problems found during additive manufacturing are proposed . 
As metallic additive manufacturing grew in sophistication , users have requested greater control over the systems , namely the ability to fully change the process parameters . 
The goal of this manuscript is to review the effects of major process parameters on build quality ( porosity , residual stress , and composition changes ) and materials properties ( microstructure and microsegregation ) , and to serve as a guide on how these parameters may be modified to achieve specific design goals for a given part . 
The focus of this paper is on laser powder bed fusion , but elements can be applied to electron beam powder bed fusion or direct energy deposition techniques . 
Stellite-6 FSW tools were developed on H13 steel by additive manufacturing ( AM ) . 
Tool performance was evaluated in friction stir welding/ processing of CuCrZr . 
No tool wear or plastic deformation was observed on Stellite-6 tool . 
This performed better than H13 as-received , heat treated and laser remelted tools . 
Tool wear and failure mechanism investigated in conventional and AM tools . 
In the recent time friction stir welding ( FSW ) , a solid state welding process has rapidly gained attention for joining high melting point materials like Cu , Fe , Ti and their alloys apart from Al alloys due to its several advantages over fusion welding techniques . 
AISI H13 , a versatile chromium–molybdenum hot work hardened steel , has been the most commonly used as a tool material for aluminium alloys . 
However , low tool life due to plastic deformation and wear at elevated temperatures is limiting its application in welding of high melting point materials . 
In the present work the performances of as-received , heat treated , laser remelted and Stellite 6 hardfaced H13 steel tools in friction stir processing ( FSP ) of CuCrZr have been investigated . 
Stellite 6 hardfaced FSW tools are developed by additive manufacturing ( AM ) process on H13 steel as a base material . 
In all these cases except the Stellite 6 hardfaced tool , the shoulder and pin are found to deform plastically with significant wear of shoulder along with the diffusion of CuCrZr into tool from tool pin-shoulder interface . 
However , tools developed by AM process are found to remain intact without any significant deformation or wear . 
GMAW ( Gas Metal Arc Welding ) of titanium is not currently used in industry due to the high levels of spatter generation , the wandering of the welding arc and the consequent waviness of the weld bead . 
This paper reports on the use of laser welding in conduction mode to stabilize the CMT ( Cold Metal Transfer ) , a low heat input GMAW process . 
The stabilization and reshaping of Ti-6Al-4 V weld beads was verified for laser hybrid GMAW bead on plate deposition . 
The laser beam was defocused , used in conduction mode , and was positioned concentric with the welding wire and the welding arc ( CMT ) .Finally , the results obtained for bead-on-plate welding were applied to an additively manufactured structure , in which a laser-hybrid stabilized sample was built and then evaluated against CMT-only sample . 
This work reveals that laser can be used to stabilize the welding process , improve the weld-bead shape of single and multiple layer depositions and increase the deposition rate of additive manufacture of Ti-6Al-4 V from1.7 kg/h to 2.0 kg/h . 
Additive Manufacturing is an established process group that includes various technologies . 
In contrast to subtractive methods , complex components can be produced by applying layers of construction materials . 
In accordance with the standard VDI Guideline 3405 , additive manufacturing technologies can be differentiated into wire- and powder-based technologies . 
The basis for these experimental investigations is a Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing ( WAAM ) process with a high build-up rate ( Cold Metal Transfer - CMT ) to produce a rectangular thin-walled component made of G4Si1 ( 1.5130 ) . 
In order to analyze the influence of a subsequent forming process on the microstructural properties and the forming behavior of the components , compression tests were carried out . 
Therefore , cylindrical specimens were made out of the additively manufactured components by machining . 
To be able to take a possible anisotropy in the workpiece caused by the multi-layer welding into account , the samples were taken both along and across the welding direction . 
To evaluate the inhomogeneous component properties , cast specimens with a representative microstructure were produced by inductive melting of the filler material and subsequent a solidification with an appropriate cooling rate . 
In addition to the cold forming of the additively manufactured components , the investigation also includes hot forming and the influence of a corresponding heat treatment . 
The experimental examination was completed by the analysis of the microstructure of each material state.The aim of the research work was to prove the homogenization and optimization of the mechanical properties of additive manufactured components due to a subsequent forming process . 
Highlight An experimental work to investigate the formation of the humping phenomena in the positional deposition using WAAM . 
Mechanism of humping formation is analysed to explain humping occurrence for positional deposition . 
The impacts of welding parameters and positions on humping formation are investigated through a series of tests . 
A series of guidelines are summarised to assist the path planning and process parameter selection processes in multi-directional WAAM . 
Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing ( WAAM ) is a promising technology for fabricating medium to large scale metallic parts with excellent productivity and flexibility . 
Due to the positional capability of some welding processes , WAAM is able to deposit parts with overhanging features in an arbitrary direction without additional support structures . 
There has been significant research on the humping phenomenon in the downhand welding , but it is doubtful whether the existing theories of humping formation can be applied in the positional deposition during WAAM process . 
This study has therefore provided an experimental work to investigate the formation of the humping phenomena in the positional deposition during additive manufacturing with the gas metal arc welding . 
Firstly , the mechanism of humping formation was analysed to explain humping occurrence for positional deposition . 
Then , the mechanism was validated through experiments with different welding parameters and positions . 
Finally , a series of guidelines are summarised to assist the path planning and process parameter selection processes in multi-directional WAAM . 
Automated weld deposition coupled with the real-time robotic NDT is discussed . 
An intentionally embedded defect , a tungsten rod , is introduced for verification . 
A partially-filled groove sample is also manufactured and ultrasonically tested . 
For performance verification of the in-process inspection system , an intentionally embedded defect , a tungsten rod , is introduced into the multi-pass weld . 
A partially-filled groove ( staircase ) sample is also manufactured and ultrasonically tested to calibrate the real-time inspection implemented on all seven layers of the weld which are deposited progressively . 
The tungsten rod is successfully detected in the real-time NDE of the deposited position . 
Non-weldable Ni-based superalloy Alloy713ELC could be fabricated by electron beam melting . 
Process condition could be efficiently optimized by using support vector machine . 
Additive manufactured Alloy713ELC showed columnar grain along building direction . 
Additive manufactured Alloy713ELC showed good ductility along building direction . 
Additive manufactured Alloy713ELC showed good creep properties along building direction . 
An efficient optimization method based on a support vector machine ( SVM ) is used to optimize multiple process parameters of selective electron beam melting ( SEBM ) for a non-weldable nickel-base superalloy Alloy713ELC . 
The global optimum condition and the near optimum conditions are extracted to fabricate SEBM samples . 
All the SVM optimized conditions lead to near net shaped samples with even top surfaces . 
The sample fabricated under the global optimum condition for sample dimension of 10 mm exhibits pore-less cross-sections , columnar grains with fine γ′ precipitates and fine substructure , a small amount of grain boundary crack and excellent room temperature tensile properties . 
The samples fabricated under the global optimum condition and a near optimum condition with increased beam current for sample dimension of 15 mm exhibit excellent creep properties under 980 °C . 
In both the two situations for sample dimensions of 10 mm and 15 mm , SEBM samples with mechanical properties superior to conventional cast alloys can be achieved by testing only 1–3 SVM optimized conditions . 
We demonstrate the current method is effective for optimizing SEBM process , especially when multiple parameters need to be considered simultaneously . 
Besides , this method can rapidly provide not only a batch of conditions leading to samples with good top surfaces but also the optimum conditions leading to good building quality and superior mechanical properties . 
In gas tungsten arc welding ( GTAW ) based additive manufacturing ( AM ) , omni-directional deposition with side feeding is common when depositing complex parts , which is different from the gas metal arc welding ( GMAW ) . 
While side feeding may lead to unstable deposition process and deposition deviation . 
In this paper , a wire melting simulation model was established to analyse the behaviour of the wire in the arc column . 
An index of weld bead offset tolerance capacity is proposed to quantitatively analyse the sensitivity of the weld bead offset to the wire feed speed . 
Single-layer experiments were conducted to analyse the relationships between the deposition parameters and the weld melting/bead offset . 
A multi-layer sample with an actual usable area ratio of 95.11 % was deposited by using the proposed model and the optimized deposition parameters . 
The experimental results show that the control of the weld melting offset is the key factor in realizing the stability and accuracy of omni-directional GTAW-based AM . 
Advancement in manufacturing technology , prototyping , machining etc . 
are concerned with material optimization , process optimization , financial optimization and sustainable development . 
The current review on characterization , applications and process study of various additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes deals with the systematic use of resources in product development . 
The comprehensive description on additive manufacturing techniques , its applications and needs are illustrated . 
The attempt is to diagnose the research gap in the process study and to forecast the new methodology and applications in the all the field like automobile , aerospace , biomedical etc . 
through AM . 
The tool making for friction stir welding purpose , complex geometries , etc . 
were fabricated without increasing the overall cost through AM techniques . 
The applications of AM techniques in composite based materials are also characterized . 
The comparative analysis between subtractive and additive manufacturing are highlighted and future scope is tried to identify . 
Internal defects in additive manufactured Mo are analyzed . 
3D Computed Tomography is used to analyze the 3D information . 
Volume and sphericity distribution of defects are studied . 
Formation mechanisms of different internal defects are proposed . 
Relationship between defects and process parameters is disclosed . 
Molybdenum ( Mo ) is an important high-temperature structural material but has poor processability . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) leads to a new possibility of fabricating Mo structural parts . 
However , a large number of internal defects appear during welding and AM processes in Mo and its alloys , which is far from well understood and has greatly limited their application . 
In this paper , the formation and evolution mechanisms of internal defects in Mo are systematically studied , based on the state-of-the-art high-resolution computed tomography . 
This study demonstrates three main types of defects in Mo : ( 1 ) small spherical pores ; ( 2 ) inverted pear-shaped pores ; and ( 3 ) cavities . 
The first type is similar to the observation in welded Mo , while the last two types are not reported before , which are associated with the heat cycling process during AM . 
The formation mechanism of different types of internal defects is proposed based on the experimental observations . 
Material extrusion ( MatEx ) additive manufacturing ranges in size from the desktop scale fused filament fabrication ( FFF ) to the room scale big area additive manufacturing ( BAAM ) . 
The principles of how FFF and BAAM operate are similar – polymer feedstocks are heated until molten and then extruded to form three-dimensional parts through layer-by-layer additive manufacturing . 
This study compares heat transfer in FFF and BAAM using finite element thermal modeling . 
Parameterization is performed across material properties , layer number , and print speed at the desktop and room scale for MatEx . 
BAAM stays hotter than FFF for a longer period of time , which facilitates interlayer diffusion and weld formation , but can also lead to slumping or sagging . 
Changes in thermal diffusivity affect FFF more than BAAM , with FFF exhibiting a local maximum in weld time at the thermal diffusivity of ABS . 
For BAAM , the temperature and thermal history of the center of an extruded bead differs greatly from the surface of the bead , which has important implications for process monitoring , property prediction , and part performance . 
Wire arc additive manufacturing , WAAM , is a popular wire-feed additive manufacturing technology that creates components through the deposition of material layer-by-layer . 
WAAM has become a promising alternative to conventional machining due to its high deposition rate , environmental friendliness and cost competitiveness . 
In this research work , a comparison is made between two different WAAM technologies , GMAW ( gas metal arc welding ) and PAW ( plasma arc welding ) . 
Comparative between processes is centered in the main variations while manufacturing Mn4Ni2CrMo steel walls concerning geometry and process parameters maintaining the same deposition ratio as well as the mechanical and metallographic properties obtained in the walls with both processes , in which the applied energy is significantly different . 
This study shows that acceptable mechanical characteristics are obtained in both processes compared to the corresponding forging standard for the tested material , values are 23 % higher for UTS and 56 % for elongation in vertical direction in the PAW process compared to GMAW ( no differences in UTS and elongation results for horizontal direction and in Charpy for both directions ) and without significant directional effects of the additive manufacturing technology used . 
Based on cold metal transfer welding , wire and arc additive manufacturing is used to manufacture 9Cr ferritic/martensitic nuclear grade steel component for the first time . 
The microstructure mainly consists of untempered martensite laths showing columnar laths and equiaxed laths . 
Positions at different heights along the deposition direction have no significant influence on micro hardness and tensile properties . 
Tensile properties in the horizontal and vertical directions show anisotropy . 
Fracture surfaces mainly exhibit typical mixed mode fracture . 
Wire and arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) technology was successfully applied to manufacture the 9Cr ferritic/martensitic nuclear grade steel for the first time . 
With the purpose of revealing how microstructure and mechanical properties are affected by the different locations within the manufactured wall , cold metal transfer ( CMT ) welding was used as heat source , the microstructure and mechanical properties of the additively manufactured 9Cr ferritic/martensitic wall in the different locations have been investigated . 
The results show that the differences in the mechanical properties were related to the anisotropy in microstructure . 
The microstructure mainly consisted of untempered martensite laths showing columnar laths and equiaxed laths . 
As the height of the deposited wall increased , the microstructures exhibited differences . 
Positions at different heights had no significant influence on micro hardness and room-temperature tensile testing results . 
However , the tensile properties including the ultimate tensile strength , 0.2 % offset yield strength and elongation exhibited anisotropy for the perpendicular to and parallel to the deposition direction . 
The defects and tensile fracture behavior were also analyzed carefully . 
The findings suggest that , despite the emergency of a few shortcomings , the WAAM technology is a feasible method to obtain 9Cr ferritic/martensitic nuclear grade steel parts . 
Wire arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) is a metal additive manufacturing process based on gas metal arc welding and it is known to be economically convenient for large metal parts with low complexity . 
The main issue WAAM is the sensibility to heat accumulation , i.e. 
, a progressive increase in the internal energy of the workpiece due to the high heat input of the deposition process , that is responsible of excessive remelting of the lower layers and the related change in bead geometry . 
A promising technique to mitigate such issue is to use an air jet impinging on the deposited material to increase the rate of convective heat transfer . 
Different samples are manufactured using AWS ER70S-6 as filler material , using as cooling approaches free convection and air jet impingement , with different interlayer idle times . 
The measurement of substrate temperatures has been used to validate the process simulation , used for obtaining the temperature field of the whole part . 
The results indicate that air jet impingement has a significant impact on the process , limiting the progressive increase in the interlayer temperature as compared to free convection cooling . 
From the results arise that the optimal idle time is 30 s , as a compromise between productivity and reduction of heat accumulation , independently from the cooling strategy . 
Friction stir additive manufacturing ( FSAM ) was performed successfully using 2 mm thick sheets of 2195-T8 aluminum-lithium alloy . 
The influence of the tool pin shape and process parameters on the interfacial bonding features among the additive manufactured layers was discussed , and the effects of interfacial defects on the performances of the additive build were analyzed based on microstructures , hardness profiles , and mechanical property evaluations . 
It is shown that the shape of the tool pin is one of the key factors in influencing the bonding interface between two manufactured layers . 
The cylindrical pin and the conical pin with three flats are not suitable for the FSAM process since very poor material mixing features are produced along the bonding interface . 
Although the material mixing degree of bonding interface is obviously improved at the advancing side ( AS ) interface of the nugget zone ( NZ ) by using the convex featured pin or the pin with three concave arc grooves , the material mixing degree at the retreating side ( RS ) interface of the NZ is always insufficient . 
Meanwhile , the weak-bonding defects along the bonding interfaces could be formed , which are originated from the hooking defects on the RS . 
The weak-bonding defects are related to the oxides and impurities existing at the original bonding interfaces as well as the insufficient stirring action of the tool pin . 
The welding rotation speeds of 800 , 900 and 1000 rpm for giving welding speed of 100 mm/min were used in the additive manufacturing processes of 2195-T8 aluminum-lithium alloy , in which the optimum microstructure is obtained with the rotation speed of 800 rpm . 
The soften degree for the multilayered build is obvious , and the hardness profiles across the different bonding interfaces are always uneven . 
Meanwhile , compared with the AS interface , the fluctuation of the hardness value at the RS interface is greater . 
The mechanical properties of the multilayered build are inhomogeneous , and the maximum tensile strength of the multilayered build is only reached the 56.6 % of the base metal . 
The mechanical properties are closely associated with the soften tendency of the material and the degree of the amelioration of weak-bonding defect along the bonding interface . 
The influence of the addition of filler powder on the microstructure and properties of laser-welded Ti2AlNb joints was comparatively investigated using scanning electron microscopy , transmission electron microscopy , electron back scattered diffraction , and tensile tests . 
The heat affected zone ( HAZ ) of laser-additive-welded joints was divided into B2 , B2 + α2 , and B2 + α2 + O — three regions with increasing distance from the fusion line . 
The HAZ of laser-welded joints could only be divided into two regions , viz. 
, B2 + α2 and B2 + α2 + O . 
The microstructure of the fusion zone was composed of a single B2 phase for both laser welding and laser-additive welding . 
Columnar grains were observed in the fusion zone of laser-welded joints , while the B2 grains in the fusion zone of laser-additive-welded joints were basically equiaxed . 
A misorientation angle distribution analysis showed that the fraction of high-angle grain boundaries of laser-additive-welded joints was higher than that of laser-welded joints . 
The addition of filler powder promoted heterogeneous nucleation during solidification in laser-additive welding . 
Following tensile tests at room temperature , failure tended to occur in the fusion zone of the laser-welded joints and in the HAZ of the laser-additive-welded joints . 
The laser-additive-welded joints exhibited better tensile properties because of the higher Mo content as well as the equiaxed microstructure of the fusion zone . 
A flat specimen and a curved specimen with a thickness of 50 mm were excavated from a large circular wire+arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) mockup . 
The biaxial internal residual stress distributions in the specimens were measured using the two-cut contour method . 
The stress distributions in the large circular WAAM mockup were deduced , and the effects of specimen shape and dimension on the remnant stress distributions in the specimens were discussed . 
The investigated results show that the stress in the circular WAAM mockup has a similar distribution as that in thick multipass joints at the weld centerline , the stress in the curved specimen extracted from a large circular WAAM mockup can reflect the stress distribution trend in the mockup . 
For specimens excavated from a large circular mockup , the specimen shape has no significant effect on the through-thickness axial stress distribution , while it has a significant effect on the hoop stress distribution . 
Carbon fiber reinforced plastic ( CFRP ) is an extremely beneficial composite material in the aerospace and automobile industries owing to its high-strength-to-weight ratio , high stiffness , lightweight , and corrosion resistance . 
A thin layer material such as Titanium ( Ti ) is often used along with CFRP laminates to address these issues . 
These techniques have several limitations including weight addition , stress cracking , delamination , and limited operating temperatures . 
These limitations can be readily addressed by the use of solid-state welding techniques based on ultrasonic energy . 
One such technique is the Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing ( UAM ) process , which is capable of fabricating 3D structures of CFRP/Ti laminar composites . 
Preliminary experimental studies proved the feasibility of using the UAM process to join CFRP/Ti stacks . 
Further development of this process needs a detailed investigation of the process parameters . 
This study aims to study the effect of critical process parameters including the ultrasonic energy and pre-surface roughness on the shear strength of the fabricated CFRP/Ti stacks using the UAM process . 
The study found that both ultrasonic energy and surface roughness have a positive impact on the resulting shear strengths of the UAM fabricated structures . 
Magnetic Arc Oscillation was applied during the construction of single-pass multi-layer walls of low carbon steel and Ti6Al4V by the Gas Tungsten Arc Welding-based Wire and Arc Additive Manufacturing process , and the influence on the geometry and the process stability was evaluated . 
The geometric features were assessed using transverse section macrographs and the effects of different patterns and frequencies of oscillation on the arc characteristics , metal transfer and weld pool behavior during the layer deposition were investigated using high speed and welding cameras . 
Furthermore , the distribution of material along the wall length becomes more homogeneous . 
An explanation of the effects of Magnetic Arc Oscillation on the wall geometry based on forces that act on the molten metal during layer deposition was made . 
Because of the swinging movement of the welding arc , the heat is distributed over a larger area , and the power density decreases . 
Thus , fewer previous layers are remelted , and the volume and the weight of the weld pool reduce . 
The weld pool temperature drops , and the surface tension force and the viscous friction increase . 
The distribution of arc pressure also becomes less concentrated , and the arc force on the molten metal decreases . 
Additionally , a magnetic force appears on the molten metal , which contributes to a change in the direction of the resultant force on the weld pool . 
The article presents new findings on arc stability in twin-wire robotic arc welding corresponding to the torch orientation and electrodes ' position . 
The two mutually influencing co-existing arcs affect the stability of counterpart arc , and thereby alter the weld bead properties . 
The investigation divulges that electrode positions and torch orientation significantly impact arc stability which in turn impacts the heat input and weld bead geometry . 
The arc penetration in tandem orientation is augmented by the secondary arc that operates in the same weld pool . 
While the transverse orientation improves the arc stability and facilitates a wider weld bead with reasonable weld penetration suitable for applications such as wire additive manufacturing and cladding . 
An approach for predicting arc stability as a function of process parameters is a significant contribution from this investigation . 
The insight into the arching phenomenon in twin-wire gas metal arc welding due to the investigation is expected to help the machine builders to design an appropriate controller that minimizes arc interference . 
This study presents investigations on the additive manufacturing of hot work steel with the energy-reduced gas metal arc welding ( GMAW ) process , which is a cold metal transfer ( CMT ) process . 
The paper analyses the influence of arc energy and the thermal field on the resulting mechanical properties and microstructure of the material . 
The investigations were carried out with hot work tool steel X37CrMoV 5-1 , which is used for the manufacturing of plastic moulds , hot extrusion dies , and forging dies . 
The results show that this steel can be used to generate 3D metal components or structures with high reproducibility , near-net-shaped geometry , absence of cracks , and a deposition rate of up to 3.6 kg/h . 
The variation of the wire feed speed and the welding speed enables the production of weld beads of width up to 9.4 mm . 
The mechanical properties of the generated structures can be adapted by the dominant thermal field , which in turn is influenced by the bypass temperature and the electric arc energy . 
If the bypass temperature is above the martensite start temperature ( Ms ) , there is a homogeneous hardness level along the height of the additively manufactured structure height as long as the energy produced by the welding arc is enough to keep the temperature of all layers above Ms. Wire-arc additive manufacturing has become an alternative way to produce industrial parts . 
In this work 15 kg walls are built with an effective building rate of 4.85 kg/h using an ER100 wire providing good tensile properties and toughness under welding conditions . 
The thermal evolution of the walls during manufacturing is measured by thermocouples and an IR camera : it depends on process parameters , deposit strategy and the size of the part . 
The walls are then characterised as deposit and after heat treatment through hardness , tensile and Charpy-V notch tests . 
The results show a fine microstructure with unexpected retained austenite and coarse allotriomorphic ferrite in the as deposited walls . 
The final hardness values vary from about 220 to 280 HV2 ; the yield stress and tensile strength are 520 and 790 MPa , respectively , and a toughness of about 50 J is obtained at room temperature . 
The heat treatment transforms the retained austenite , leading to an improvement of the yield stress to 600 MPa . 
Ultrasonic additive manufacturing is a promising approach for making net-shaped multi-material laminates from material combinations difficult to process with fusion-based additive manufacturing techniques . 
The properties of these multi-material laminates depend sensitively on the interface between the constituents , which can be decorated with pores as well as thin intermetallic layers . 
Here , we develop process models for junction growth and interdiffusion during ultrasonic additive manufacturing of dissimilar metals . 
These process models are validated against published experimental data , then used to generate process diagrams which reveal that high normal loads and high sonotrode velocities can reduce intermetallic growth while maintaining strong interlayer bonding . 
Ultrasonic additive manufacturing ( UAM ) is a solid-state manufacturing technology for producing near-net shape metallic parts combining additive ultrasonic metal welding and subtractive machining . 
Even though UAM has been demonstrated to produce robust metal builds in Al–Al , Al–Ti , Al-steel , Cu–Cu , Al–Cu , and other material systems , UAM welding of high strength steels has proven challenging . 
This study investigates process and post-processing methods to improve UAM steel weld quality and demonstrates the UAM fabrication of stainless steel 410 ( SS 410 ) builds which possess , after post-processing , mechanical properties comparable with bulk material . 
Unlike UAM fabrication of softer metals , this study shows that increasing the baseplate temperature from 38∘C ( 100∘F ) to 204∘C ( 400∘F ) improves interfacial strength and structural homogeneity of the UAM steel samples . 
Further improvement in strength is achieved through post-processing . 
The hot isostatic pressing ( HIP ) post treatment improves the shear strength of UAM samples to 344 MPa from 154 MPa for as-welded samples . 
Microstructural analyses with SEM and EBSD show no evidence of body centered cubic ( BCC ) ferrite to face centered cubic ( FCC ) austenite transformation taking place during UAM welding of SS 410 . 
The weld quality improvement of UAM steel at higher baseplate temperatures is believed to be caused by the reduction of the yield strength of SS 410 at elevated temperature . 
HIP treatment is shown to increase the overall hardness of UAM SS 410 from 204 ± 7 HV to 240 ± 16 HV due to the formation of local pockets of martensite . 
Nanohardness tests show that the top of layer n is harder than the bottom of layer n+1 due to grain boundary strengthening . 
The locked in residual stresses in a monopile structure have a great impact on its fatigue life . 
The new emerged technology of additive manufacturing ( AM ) , which is widely used in other industries such as aerospace and automotive , has the potential to significantly improve a lifespan of the structure by managing the residual stress fields and microstructure in the future monopiles , and moreover reduce the manufacturing cost . 
In order to achieve this goal , new materials that are used for additive manufacturing parts fabrication and their behaviour in the harsh marine environment and under operational loading conditions need to be understood . 
Also purely welding fabrication technique employed during AM process is likely to significantly affect crack growth behaviour in air as well as in seawater . 
This paper presents a review of additive manufacturing technology and suitable techniques for offshore structures . 
Existing literature that reports current data on fracture toughness and fatigue crack growth tests conducted on AM parts is summarised and analysed , highlighting different steel grades and applications , with the view to illustrating the requirements for the new optimised functionally graded structures in offshore wind structures by means of AM technique . 
In this paper , the results of two different wire based additive-layer-manufacturing systems are compared : in one system Ti-6Al4V is deposited by a Nd : YAG laser beam , in the other by an arc beam ( tungsten inert gas process ) . 
Mechanical properties of the deposits and of plate material are presented and evaluated with respect to aerospace material specifications . 
The mechanical tests including static tension and high cycle fatigue were performed in as-built , stress-relieved and annealed conditions.Generally , the mechanical properties of the components are competitive to cast and even wrought material properties and can attain properties suitable for space or aerospace applications . 
Realizing improved strength in composite metallic materials remains a challenge using conventional welding and joining systems due to the generation and development of brittle intermetallic compounds caused by complex thermal profiles during solidification . 
Here , wire arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) process was used to fabricate a steel-nickel structural component , whose average tensile strength of 634 MPa significantly exceeded that of feedstock materials ( steel , 537 MPa and nickel , 455 MPa ) , which has not been reported previously . 
The as-fabricated sample exhibited hierarchically structural heterogeneity due to the interweaving deposition strategy . 
The improved mechanical response during tensile testing was due to the inter-locking microstructure forming a strong bond at the interface and solid solutions strengthening from the intermixing of the Fe and Ni increased the interface strength , beyond the sum of parts . 
The research offers a new route for producing high-quality steel-nickel dissimilar structures and widens the design opportunities of monolithic components , with site-specific properties , for specific structural or functional applications . 
Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing ( WAAM ) is a fusion- and wire-based additive manufacturing technology which has gained industrial interest for the production of medium-to-large components with high material deposition rates . 
However , in-depth studies on performance indicators that incorporate economic and environmental sustainability still have to be carried out . 
The first aim of the paper has been to quantify the performance metrics of WAAM-based manufacturing approaches , while varying the size and the deposited material of the component . 
Wire-arc additive manufacturing is an additive manufacturing technology which allows for high deposition rates and is well suited for manufacturing larger parts in a short time compared to other additive manufacturing technologies . 
The technology has already received considerable industrial take-up for various materials and applications . 
The aim of this work is to investigate the alloy EN AW 6016 as wire stock for WAAM . 
To establish this , aluminum wire was produced by wire drawing . 
Using this wire , specimens were produced on base plate material using a variety of process parameters . 
These parts were then used to evaluate the mechanical properties . 
Further properties such as porosity and hardness were investigated using light optical microscopy . 
Based on the results , the potential of the alloy for WAAM of lightweight parts is discussed . 
Cu-Al alloy was in-situ fabricated by twin wire arc additive manufacturing . 
Addition of about 2 % silicon to the copper-aluminum alloy helps to increase the hardness by 0.5–1 times . 
With the aluminum content increases , the yield strength increases 150 MPa . 
CuAl2 with the different crystal structures were synthetized . 
Present work investigated the use of Cold Metal Transfer ( CMT ) welding for additive manufacturing of copper‑aluminum alloys with addition of silicon in small amount . 
The additive manufacturing was successfully demonstrated through two samples with the 4.34 % ( sample-1 ) and 6.58 % ( sample-2 ) aluminum content , which is not much different with the content of the design . 
The analyses of performance of samples reveal that both samples have good strength and ductility . 
It is also found addition of silicon in small amount ( 2.1 % –2.4 % ) effectively improves hardness , tensile strength and 0.2 % offset Yield Strength in comparison to pure copper‑aluminum alloy . 
The results of X-ray diffraction ( XRD ) , showed that sample-2 possessed CuAl2 with different crystal structure whereas sample-1 did not . 
It is found that an increase in aluminum caused both tensile strength and 0.2 % offset Yield Strength to increase , however , increase in yield strength was very significant ( 155 MPa i.e . 
In this study , the 0.2Pct offset Yield Strength of sample-1 is 150 MPa more than that of sample-2 . 
Embedding with additive manufacturing ( AM ) is a process of incorporating functional components , such as sensors and actuators , in the printed structure by inserting them into a specially designed cavity . 
The print process has to be interrupted after the cavity is printed to insert the component . 
This allows for multifunctional structures to be created directly from the build plate . 
However , previous research has shown that this process interruption causes failure at the paused layer due to the cooling between the layers . 
The presence of the designed cavity further impacts the strength of the part due to a reduction in the effective cross-section in contact between the paused and the resumed layers . 
This research presents a methodology to predict the weld strength between the layers of an embedded material extrusion structure by obtaining the thermal history at the layer interface as a result of process interruption . 
An infrared camera and an embedded thermocouple are used to obtain the thermal history of the depositing fresh layer and of the layer interface , respectively . 
The impact of toolpath design on the thermal history of the layer interface is considered by dividing the cross-section area into zones with similar thermal history . 
Polymer weld theory is utilized to predict the strength at these different zones , where material properties are obtained through rheology measurements . 
These strength values for the zones are then used to predict the load at failure for different specimens by treating them as composites . 
Findings confirm that this approach can be used to more accurately predict tensile loads at failure for embedded structures , with errors ranging from 1 % to 20 % depending on the toolpath geometry . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) is the umbrella term that covers a variety of techniques that build up structures layer-by-layer as opposed to machining and other subtracting methods . 
It keeps evolving as an important technology in prototyping and the development of new devices . 
However , using AM on a larger scale is still challenging , as traditional methods require the AM machines to be larger than the manufactured structure . 
The focus in this paper is the feasibility of large-scale AM of metallic materials by arc welding . 
A series of experiments with robotic arc welding using an ABB IRB2400/10 robot are presented and discussed . 
These experiment will help map some of the challenges that need to be addressed in future work . 
Hydrodynamic flow is used for surface finishing of additive manufactured channels . 
The surface finish quality ( Ra and Rz ) of additive manufactured channels improves by > 90 % . 
The surface integrity of the channels also improves after surface finishing . 
A surface roughness ratio of ≈1.0 is achieved in the additive manufactured channel . 
The surface finishing of internal channels for components built using additive manufacturing is a challenge . 
The resulting surface finish uniformity of additive manufactured internal channels ( such as fuel transfer lines and cooling passages ) is an issue . 
Therefore , we propose a novel surface finishing technique using controlled hydrodynamic multiphase flow with abrasion phenomenon to overcome the challenges in the surface finishing of additive manufactured internal channels . 
In this study , we performed the internal surface finishing on AlSi10Mg components manufactured by direct metal laser sintering . 
We investigated the surface finish potential of the proposed hydrodynamic cavitation abrasive finishing ( HCAF ) by varying the process parameters , namely , the hydrodynamic upstream and downstream fluid pressures , fluid temperature , abrasive concentration , and processing time . 
The HCAF process resulted in greater than 90 % ( Ra and Rz ) surface finish improvements with an acceptable thickness loss from the internal channels . 
We precisely mapped the surface morphology transformation at the demarcated zones over the processing time and explained the material removal mechanism . 
In addition , we analyzed and discussed the surface integrity of the channels in terms of the microstructure , surface hardness , and residual stress . 
Furthermore , we performed large-area surface topography measurements . 
Then , we analyzed the resulting areal surface texture parameters to determine the uniformity and flatness of the surface after internal surface finishing . 
Finally , we discussed the significance of using the proposed HCAF process for complex additive manufactured internal channels . 
Additive manufacturing can produce very complex and highly integrated parts that can not be manufactured by traditional methods . 
The aim of this study was to find out the laser weldability of the printed AlSi10Mg material without filler material . 
The laser used in these welding experiments was Yb : YAG disk laser . 
The laser wavelength was 1030 nm and the maximum output power on the workpiece surface was 4 kW . 
AlSi10Mg is a widely used material in parts that are produced utilizing the SLM technique . 
The material has very good corrosion resistance properties , good electrical conductivity and excellent thermal conductivity . 
AlSi10Mg has proven to be much easier to print than steel materials , so it is a popular material also in prototype production . 
Based on welding tests , laser welding without filler material is suitable for AlSi10Mg material and the static strength of the weld is reasonably good compared to the base material . 
However , AlSi10Mg can be found to be challenging due to its composition . 
Additive manufacturing has experienced a remarkably growth over the last few years , making possible not only to make prototypes , but also to produce final products , so nowadays most of recent works are focused in metal additive manufacturing . 
The main objective of this work is to show the first experiences in the development of a cost effective metal additive manufacturing system on the basis of gas metal arc welding ( GMAW ) . 
The proposed system , wire and arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) , integrates a cold metal transfer ( CMT ) welding equipment patented by Fronius® , and a CNC milling machine Optimus with three axis and it presents the advantages to reduce the heat accumulation originated using a conventional GMAW equipment and the possibility to implement surface finish operations by milling . 
Additive processes show a smaller amount of wasted material . 
For material removal ratios over 55 % additive processes show less demand of energy . 
For material removal ratios over 75 % additive processes show less processing time . 
This paper aims to analyze and compare the electrical energy and material efficiency of machining , additive and hybrid manufacturing . 
The analysis of the manufacturing processes is based on machine tool data from a sample process . 
To get a generalized statement about the energy consumption of the investigated processes the electrical energy demand was extrapolated as a function of the material removal ratio . 
The results indicate that hybrid manufacturing becomes beneficial from an environmental point of view compared to milling , when the material removal ratio exceeds 55 % . 
The electrical break-even point for selective laser melting is approximated to 82 % material removal ratio from data extrapolation . 
Subsequently , opportunities for electrical energy and material efficiency improvements are presented for these technologies to gain an understanding of how each can contribute to a more sustainable manufacturing landscape . 
The chemical composition of the deposited metal could be estimated . 
The chemical composition could be changed gradually using proposed process . 
Wire and arc-based additive manufacturing ( AM ) is an additive manufacturing technique applying arc welding technology , where the metal melted by the arc discharge is accumulated and deposited . 
High-performance products with an excellent mechanical or chemical properties can be obtained using more than two materials through wire and arc-based AM . 
However , thermal stress and residual stress can form around the interface between two materials . 
Therefore , the objective of this study is to control the chemical composition of the deposited metal so that it changes gradually near the interface . 
Intermediate layers , with controlled chemical compositions , were inserted between the materials boundary . 
To regulate the chemical composition of the deposited metal , a filler wire was added into the molten pool during the deposition process . 
Results revealed that the chemical composition changed gradually near the interface using the proposed method . 
Selective laser melting ( SLM ) is gaining increasing relevance in industry . 
Residual deformations and internal stresses caused by the repeated layerwise melting of the metal powder and transient cooling of the solidified layers still presents a significant challenge to the profitability and quality of the process . 
Excessive distortions or cracking may lead to expensive rejects . 
In practice , critical additively manufactured parts are either iteratively pre-compensated or redesigned based on production experience . 
To satisfy the need for improved understanding of this complex manufacturing process , CAE software providers have recently developed solutions to simulate the SLM process . 
ANSYS Additive Print and ANSYS Additive Suite.ANSYS Additive Print ( AAP ) , a user-oriented software , and ANSYS Additive Suite ( AAS ) , a software requiring advanced experience with Finite Element Methods ( FEM ) , are investigated and validated with regard to residual deformations . 
For the evaluation of the two programs , calibration and validation geometries were printed by SLM in Ti–6Al–4V and residual deformations have been measured by 3D scanning . 
The results have been used for the calibration of isotropic and anisotropic strain scaling factors in AAP , and for sensitivity analyses on the effect of basic model parameters in AAS . 
The actual validation of the programs is performed on the basis of different sample geometries with varying wall thickness and deformation characteristic.While both simulation approaches , AAP and AAS , are capable of predicting the qualitative characteristics of the residual deformations sufficiently well , accurate quantitative results are difficult to obtain . 
AAP is more accessible and yields accurate results within the calibrated regime . 
Extrapolation to other geometries introduces uncertainties , however . 
Numerical efforts and modelling uncertainties as well as requirements for an extensive set of material parameters reduce its practicality , however . 
More appropriate calibration geometries , continuing extension of a more reliable material database , improved user guidelines and increased numerical efficiency are key in the future establishment of the process simulation approaches in the industrial practice . 
The loss of elemental Mg was non-negligible during WAAM . 
With the loss rate of elemental Mg increasing , the tensile strength and hardness of WAAM component decreased . 
In WAAM component of Al-Mg alloy , the lattice parameters decreased with the Mg loss rate increasing . 
Elemental Mg is easily evaporated or burnt during welding or wire + arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) , and results in a fluctuation of the composition and mechanical performances . 
Elemental Mg loss during the WAAM of Al–Mg alloy was investigated and the effect of Mg loss on the mechanical properties was discussed based on results from the chemical composition measurement and mechanical properties test . 
The elemental Mg distribution in the WAAM component was uniform , but obvious element enrichment occurred near the fusion zone of the substrate . 
With an increase in the loss rate of elemental Mg , the tensile strength and average hardness of the WAAM component decreased , whereas the elongation increased . 
During the WAAM of the Al–Mg alloy , with an increase in the Mg loss rate , the lattice parameters decreased because the solid solubility decreased in the Al matrix during the WAAM . 
Ring rolling is a flexible forming process used to produce seamless rings with various dimensions and cross sections . 
For smaller rings of up to 500 mm diameter , mechanical ring rolling machines can be used . 
A special design is a 4-mandrel-table rolling mill , which achieves high productivity due to the fact that the precursor rings are continuously conveyed through the roll gap by rotation of the table . 
The mechanical machines are usually integrated into a process chain that involves shearing of blocks , forging of blanks and ring rolling as the final process step . 
Especially profiled cross sections may require multiple forming steps to reach the final ring geometry . 
To increase the flexibility of the process , it seems viable to use highly productive additive manufacturing processes such as wire-arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) to produce pre-forms for the ring rolling process . 
WAAM is based on arc welding and allows for processing various materials with high deposition rates . 
In this case , a more complex cross section can be manufactured , so that a single ring rolling stage may be sufficient . 
However , no previous research on ring rolling of additively manufactured pre-form is known . 
The present contribution aims at analyzing the hot forming behavior of pre-forms made by WAAM during ring rolling . 
The microstructure evolution and the achieved mechanical properties will be evaluated . 
The goal of this project is to determine the efficiency of 3D printed welding jigs in pre-series body shops . 
The design of these jigs and how they function compared to conventional jig systems is analyzed . 
Additive manufactured parts possess the advantage of easier production of complex parts which would serve the purpose of designing custom jigs for different intricate detailed parts with odd orientations . 
While machining custom jigs can be costly , 3D printing these jigs provides precision as well as reduces costs and setup time since they are designed for their specific application . 
Large components can be made by laser welding EBM-built plates to wrought counterparts . 
Influence of the welding angles between EBM build direction and weld bead was studied . 
Microhardness of each zone is determined by the local microstructure . 
Tensile properties depend on the EBM base metal due to the internal defects . 
The mechanism of stress during uniaxial tension is discussed based on columnar grains and the internal defects . 
Electron beam melting ( EBM ) is an established powder-bed additive manufacturing process for small-to-medium-sized components of Ti-6Al-4V . 
For further employing EBM on fabricating large-scale components , an effort has been made by joining EBM-built Ti-6Al-4V plates to wrought counterparts using laser welding , and the welding angles between EBM build direction and weld bead have been chosen as 0° , 30° and 45° . 
The influence of the welding angles on the microstructure , microhardness of base metals , fusion zone , and heat-affected zones , as well as the macro tensile test have been characterized . 
The microhardness of each zone is determined by the local microstructure , and the macro tensile properties largely depend on the EBM base metal due to the internal defects generated during the EBM process . 
The effect of welding angles on tensile strengths is not significant , while the elongation drops from 9.4 % to 5.8 % as the welding angle increases from 0° to 45° . 
The mechanism of stress during uniaxial tension on EBM base metal is discussed based on the stress state of columnar grains and the internal defects . 
Wire-arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) has received substantial attention in recent years due to the very high build rates . 
When bulky structures are generated using standard layer-by-layer tool paths , the build rate in the outer contour of the part may lag behind the build rate in the interior . 
In WAAM , the profile of a single weld bead resembles a parabola . 
In order to keep the build rate constant at each point of the layer , optimal overlapping distances can be determined . 
This paper presents novel multi-bead overlapping models for tool path generation . 
Mathematical models are established to minimize valleys between adjacent weld beads by accounting for the overlapping volume . 
The proposed models are validated by manufacturing solid blocks from mild steel with the recommended overlapping distances . 
Macrographs are recorded to analyze the boundary profiles . 
High-integrity ceramic-metal composites combine electrical , thermal , and corrosion resistance with excellent mechanical robustness . 
Ultrasonic additive manufacturing ( UAM ) is a low temperature process that enables dissimilar material welds without inducing brittle phases . 
In this study , multiple layers of Yttria-stabilized zirconia ( YSZ ) films are jointed between layers of Al 6061-H18 matrix using a 9 kW UAM system . 
UAM is advantageous over existing metal-ceramic composite fabrication techniques by continuously joining ceramics to metals at a speed of 2 m/min while requiring a moderate temperature that is 55 % of the melting point of aluminum . 
The welding interface , which is found to include a 10 nm thick diffusion zone , is investigated using optical microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray ( EDX ) spectroscopy . 
The shear strengths of the as-welded and heat-treated composites are 72 MPa and 103 MPa , respectively . 
The shear deformation and failure mechanism of the YSZ-Al composites are investigated via finite element modeling . 
Additive manufacturing based method was used to join Polypropylene to Al-Mg alloy . 
Obtained joint was a combination of welding and mechanical lock among constituents . 
Additive filling pattern and printing temperature affected mechanical behavior . 
Introduced method was a fast and versatile technique for joining metal to polymer . 
Fused Deposition Modeling with Polypropylene filament was employed to make a lap joint between Polypropylene and pre-punched Al-Mg alloy sheets , in the form of bonds between the polymeric substrate and the additive part and mechanical lock between the additive part and aluminum base sheet . 
Effects of the joint interface area ( hole diameter of 5–13 mm ) and preheating of the substrates ( room temperature , 50 and 90℃ ) were investigated on the mechanical properties of the joints . 
Peak load in the tensile-shear and cross-tension tests increased with enhancement of the joint interface area ( up to ˜280 N and ˜160 N , respectively ) . 
Preheating of the substrates increased the joint strength via improvement in the bonds between the polymer sheet and the additive part and increase in the adhesion force between the printed layers . 
Tungsten is receiving increasing interest as a plasma facing material in the ITER fusion reactor , collimators , and other structural , high temperature applications . 
Concurrently , there is a demand for manufacturing techniques capable of processing tungsten into the desired geometries . 
Additive manufacturing is a promising technique able to produce complex parts , but the structural integrity is compromised by microcracking . 
This work combines thermomechanical simulations with in situ high-speed video of microcracking in single laser-melted tracks , visualizing the ductile-to-brittle transition . 
Microcracking is shown to occur in a narrow temperature interval between 450 K – 650 K , and to be strain rate dependent . 
The size of the crack-affected area around the scan track is determined by the maximum Von Mises residual stress , whereas crack network morphology depends on the local orientation of the principal stress . 
The fundamental understanding provided by this work contributes to future efforts in crack free , additively manufactured tungsten . 
Due to rapid , localized heating and cooling , distortions accumulate in additive manufactured laser metal deposition ( LMD ) components , leading to a loss of dimensional accuracy or even cracking . 
Numerical welding simulations allow the prediction of these deviations and their optimization before conducting experiments . 
To assess the viability of the simulation tool for the use in a predictive manner , comprehensive validations with experimental results on the newly-built part need to be conducted.In this contribution , a predictive , mechanical simulation of a thin-walled , curved LMD geometry is shown for a 30-layer sample of 1.4404 stainless steel . 
The part distortions are determined experimentally via an in-situ digital image correlation measurement using the GOM Aramis system and compared with the simulation results . 
With this benchmark , the performance of a numerical welding simulation in additive manufacturing is discussed in terms of result accuracy and usability . 
Welding of dissimilar metals is challenging , particularly between crystalline metals and metallic glasses ( MGs ) . 
In this study , Zr65.7Cu15.6Ni11.7Al3.7Ti3.3 ( wt % ) MG structures were built on 304 stainless steel ( SS ) substrates by laser-foil-printing ( LFP ) additive manufacturing technology in which MG foils were laser welded layer-by-layer onto the SS substrate with a transition route , i.e. 
, SS → V → Ti → Zr → MG . 
The direct welding of MG on SS would lead to the formation of various brittle intermetallics and the consequent peeling off of the welded MG foils from the SS substrate , which could be resolved via the use of V/Ti/Zr intermediate layers . 
The chemical composition , formed phases , and micro-hardness were characterized in the dissimilar joints by energy dispersive spectroscopy , X-ray diffraction , and micro-indentation . 
Since the intermediate materials were highly compatible with the base metals or the adjacent intermediate metals , undesirable intermetallics were not detected in the dissimilar joint . 
The bonding tensile strength between the SS substrate and the MG part with intermediate layers was measured about 477 MPa . 
The manufacturing of components from the titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4 V is of great significance for many industrial sectors . 
The production of high-performance Ti-6Al-4 V components typically requires multiple hot forging steps and leads to parts with tolerances that need extensive machining to create the final shape . 
For many applications , net-shape technologies such as additive manufacturing ( AM ) could enable a higher material yield . 
Thus , the advantages of AM and forging operations could be exploited by combining both processes to new hybrid process chains . 
The present study investigates the use of Wire-Arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) for hybrid manufacturing of Ti-6Al-4 V aerospace components . 
Two process routes are investigated that combine forming and AM processes . 
In the first process route , a WAAM process is used to generate a pre-shaped semi-finished part . 
The semi-finished part will then be forged using a single forming tool to obtain the final part contour . 
The second process route utilizes a conventionally forged pre-form , onto which features of the final workpiece are added using WAAM . 
The results confirm that hybrid technologies combining WAAM and forging are very promising for Ti-6Al-4 V part production . 
A jet engine blade produced by WAAM and subsequent forging shows microstructures typically produced in conventional processing of Ti-6Al-4 V alloy and exhibits tensile properties , which exceed the specification level of cast and forged Ti-6Al-4 V material . 
Features created by WAAM on forged pre-forms are shown to reach the mechanical properties required to combine both technologies . 
The combination of WAAM and forging may hence be used to develop new manufacturing chains that allow for higher material yield and flexibility than conventional forging . 
This paper explores the application of the ‘ mortise-and-tenon ’ concept for joining hollow section aluminium profiles to composite strips or sheets . 
Wire arc additive manufacturing is combined with joining by forming to fabricate the tenons and to obtain the mechanical interlocking with the mortises available in the strips ( or sheets ) . 
The workability limits are established by means of an analytical model that combines plastic deformation , instability and fracture . 
Experimental and finite element modelling are utilized to develop the overall joining process and to validate the round ‘ mortise-and-tenon ’ design resulting from the analytical model . 
The proposed joining process also circumvents the need to design extra fixing and interlocking features in low cost hollow section aluminium profiles for easy assembling . 
There exist several variants of Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) applicable for metals and alloys . 
The two main groups are Directed Energy Deposition ( DED ) and Powder Bed Fusion ( PBF ) . 
AM has advantages and disadvantages when compared to more traditional manufacturing methods . 
The best candidate products are those with complex shape and small series and particularly individualized product . 
Repair welding is often individualized as defects may occur at various instances in a component . 
This method was used before it became categorized as AM and in most cases , it is a DED process . 
PBF processes are more useful for smaller items and can give a finer surface . 
Both DED and PBF products require subsequent surface finishing for high performance components and sometimes there is also a need for post heat treatment . 
Modelling of AM as well as eventual post-processes can be of use in order to improve product quality , reducing costs and material waste . 
The paper describes the use of the finite element method to simulate these processes with focus on superalloys . 
Additive Manufacturing has recently emerged as an important industrial process that is capable of manufacturing parts with complex geometry . 
One of the drawbacks of metal additive manufacturing processes is the thermo-mechanical distortion of the parts during and after build due to heat effects . 
Inherent strain is widely adopted by researchers as the basis to predict part distortions during Metal Powder Bed Fusion Additive Manufacturing ( PBFAM ) process and is highly dependent on the laser hatch pattern sintering on each layer during the printing process . 
There is a clear need to predict inherent strains for a given arbitrary hatch pattern for a part model so that hatch patterns can be optimized for achieving part quality . 
In this paper , we propose a neural network based method to predict inherent strain for any given hatch pattern that is adopted during the part build . 
The authors assumed that the temperature profile inside the heat affected zone within each layer is the same if the part model is reasonably large . 
To start with , inherent strains of two hatch pattern pools with different hatch angles were obtained by thermo-mechanical simulation with temperature profiles obtained through translation and rotation of a single layer of simulation . 
A feedforward backpropagation neural network was created and trained with data obtained from an initial hatch pattern pool for predicting inherent strains . 
The data from a second hatch pattern pool was then utilized to validate the network and test the efficacy of the prediction of the trained neural network . 
The results show that the trained neural network is capable of predicting the inherent strain of any arbitrary hatch pattern within an acceptable error . 
Since the trained neural network can predict inherent strain quickly for any given hatch pattern , this could provide the basis for hatch pattern optimization of any part model to increase part build accuracy and achieve part GD & T callouts . 
An innovative manufacturing process among the metal 3D printing techniques for stainless steel material is first introduced in Structural Engineering field . 
For structural design purposes , the main issues in the realization of Wire-and-Arc Additive Manufactured stainless steel concern inherent geometrical imperfections to be properly characterized and the main material properties , influenced by the orientation of the elements . 
The first results of a wide experimental campaign devoted to assess the geometrical and mechanical characterization of Wire-and-Arc Additive Manufactured stainless steel elements evidence the need of proper evaluation of an effective geometry to derive the main mechanical parameters , which differ from the traditionally manufactured stainless steel material . 
Additive Manufacturing has recently gained great importance to produce metallic structural elements for civil engineering applications . 
While a lot of research effort has been focused on different technologies ( such as Powder Bed Fusion ) , there is still quite limited knowledge concerning the structural response of Wire-and-Arc Additive Manufactured ( WAAM ) metallic elements , as very few experimental campaigns aimed at assessing their geometrical and mechanical properties have been carried out . 
The paper presents selected results of a wide experimental campaign focused on the assessment of the main geometrical and mechanical properties of Wire-and-Arc Additive Manufactured ( WAAM ) stainless steel material , carried out at the Topography and Structural Engineering Labs of University of Bologna . 
In detail , the focus is on the characterization of the surface irregularities by means of various measuring techniques and on the evaluation of the main material mechanical properties , including tensile and compressive strengths , Young 's modulus and post elastic behavior . 
Tests results have been interpreted through statistical tools in order to derive mean values and gather information about the variability of both geometrical and mechanical parameters . 
In this work , rapid prototyping and physical modelling are used to evaluate four different extruder and deposition concepts for the Hybrid Metal Extrusion & Bonding ( HYB ) additive manufacturing ( AM ) process for aluminium alloys . 
The HYB-AM process is a branch of the HYB joining technology and is currently utilizing an extruder design that was initially developed for welding purposes . 
However , due to the different operating conditions of an AM process compared to a welding process , it is of interest to compare the current extruder to that of other alternatives to identify the optimal design . 
Plastic models of the different extruders have been produced by rapid prototyping and attached to a CNC-machine . 
To test the performance of each design , plasticine has been processed through the extruders and deposited on the machine bed . 
Key learnings from each cycle of designing , building and testing have been used as inputs for the next iteration , to finally end up with a design and the associated requirements upon which the further development process will be based .

Numerical simulation and experimental method were both used to investigate the thermal behavior , surface tension driven flow , driving mechanism and solidification characteristics . 
The temperature related driving force was qualitatively analyzed , and surface tension and surface shear stress were quantitatively studied . 
Numerical method and dimensional analysis were also carried out to understand the importance of different driving forces , respectively . 
The metallurgical model was sequentially coupled to the thermal-fluid model to calculate four solidification parameters . 
Temperature gradient was observed to be much larger at the front of the melt pool due to the effect of thermal conductivity , and decreased from center to the periphery . 
Both the surface tension and surface tension driven flow were found smaller in the central area . 
The maximum shear stress may reach 2500 N/m2 and pushed an intense outward convection . 
The solidification parameters were used to predict the solidified morphology , and the prediction was well validated by experimental results . 
The obtained basic conclusions in this work demonstrated that this study of thermal-fluid-metallurgical behavior could provide an improved understanding of the surface tension driven flow and solidification behavior inside the melt pool of welding and additive manufacturing process . 
The microstructure evolution and tensile properties of laser-additive welded Ti2AlNb joints under different heat treatments were investigated in this paper . 
The heat treatment was conducted in the B2 + O ( HT1 ) and B2 + α2 + O ( HT2 ) phase field to obtain different microstructural characteristics . 
For HT1 , due to the B2 → O transformation , the microstructure of heat affected zone was B2 + α2 + O , B2 + residual α2 + O , and B2 + O as the distance from the base metal increased . 
As for HT2 , the microstructure of heat affected zone was composed of B2 + α2 + rim-O + primary O + acicular O in the region close to the base metal , B2 + intergranular α2 + transformed O + primary O + acicular O in the region close to the fusion zone . 
The fusion zone was composed of B2 + O laths after HT1 , and B2 + intergranular α2 + transformed O + primary O + acicular O after HT2 . 
The joints composed of B2 + O phase exhibited higher tensile strength compared with the as-welded joints due to the strengthening effects of O phase . 
The intergranular α2 phase formed during HT2 was detrimental for the tensile strength . 
The joints exhibited no plastic deformation at room temperature after both heat treatments on account of the lack of independent slip systems in the O phase . 
The ductility of the heat-treated joints at 650 °C was better than that at room temperature because more slip systems were activated in the O phase . 
Compared with the joints heat-treated in HT1 , the joints after HT2 exhibited better ductility at 650 °C resulting from the coarse primary O laths and lower volume fraction of O phase . 
Corrosion resistance of carbon steel cladding is better than high speed steel . 
Wear resistance of specific carbon steel cladding is close to high speed steel . 
Submerged arc welding is available technology to improve wear and corrosion resistance of carbon steel . 
High-speed steel ( HSS ) , traditionally used in the hot rolling industry , suffers from the problem of wear and corrosion . 
For modifying the surface property of metal materials , submerged arc welding , among the industrial additive manufacturing technologies , is employed . 
In this study , we aim at improving the resistance of carbon steel cladding against corrosion and wear . 
To reduce cost , the HSS matrix is replaced by carbon steel . 
Electrochemical corrosion and high-temperature dry sliding wear experiments are implemented to study the corrosion and tribological behavior of HSS and surface-modified claddings . 
The wear and corrosion behaviors are characterized by potentiodynamic polarization , electrochemical impedance spectroscopy , wear rate , coefficient of friction , and worn surface morphology . 
The experimental results indicate that the corrosion current density ( Icorr ) of carbon steel claddings , ranging from 11.023 × 10−3 to 3.372 × 10−3 mA∙cm−2 , is lower than that of the HSS alloy ( 19.247 × 10−3 mA∙cm−2 ) . 
The passive film resistance of prepared carbon steel cladding-3 ( 1870 Ω∙cm2 ) is in fact larger than the resistance of HSS ( 1075 Ω∙cm2 ) . 
The corrosion resistance of surface-modified carbon steel claddings is better than that of the HSS . 
The wear rates of carbon steel cladding-2 ( 1.99 × 10−7 mm3·N−1·mm−1 ) and carbon steel cladding-3 ( 2.49 × 10−7 mm3·N−1·mm−1 ) approximate the wear rate of HSS ( 1.59 × 10−7 mm3·N−1·mm−1 ) . 
Moreover , the wear width of prepared carbon steel cladding-3 ( 550 μm ) is slightly larger than that of HSS ( 500 μm ) . 
The wear resistance of carbon steel cladding-3 approximates that of HSS . 
With the increase in the deposition height , the heat dissipation changes from three-dimensional on the substrate to one-dimensional on the depositing layer . 
The residual distortion can be effectively reduced by changing the depositing direction . 
The distortion of the reverse directions can be reduced by 25 % . 
The stress concentration at the end of the arc point and the stress produced by the reverse depositing model are more uniform than those produced by the same depositing model . 
The complex residual stress and distortion experienced in wire arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) can have a serious impact on production . 
In this paper , a series of ten-layer depositing walls were deposited by WAAM using the same depositing direction and reverse depositing direction to study the effect of different heat conditions on the residual stress and distortion of the deposition wall . 
The temperature field , distortion , and residual stress under different paths were obtained by performing experiments . 
Meanwhile , to calculate the variations in the temperature , stress , and distortion under different depositing paths , a model of wire arc additive manufacturing was established by using a numerical model . 
The stress distribution in the reverse directions is more uniform than that in the same directions . 
By comparison with the results from an experimental and numerical analysis , the same depositing directions have a large temperature gradient and produce greater plastic distortion during solidification . 
A concept of layer by layer constrained optimisation of multi-axis additive manufacturing trajectory for parts of revolution is presented . 
For a constrained device configuration , the use of non-optimised trajectories can lead to manufacturing failure due to an axis overtravel or singularity state ; problem which can be avoided thanks to the proposed methodology . 
The methodology has been validated by manufacturing parts of revolution on a multi-axis additive manufacturing device using a coaxial PLA deposition system . 
Parts manufactured with an optimised trajectory provide better geometrical accuracy and less results dispersion than parts manufactured without optimisation . 
This work focuses on additive manufacturing by Directed Energy Deposition ( DED ) using a 6-axis robot . 
To achieve this goal , a new layer-by-layer method coupled with a trajectory constrained optimization is presented . 
The layer-by-layer generation of optimized trajectories is validated experimentally on a 6-axis robot using a PLA extrusion system . 
Experimental results show that the layer-by-layer trajectory optimization strategy applied to parts of revolution provides better geometrical accuracy while improving the efficiency of the manufacturing device compared to non-optimized solutions . 
In the cold metal transfer additive manufacturing process of Ti-6Al-4V thin wall structure , ultrasonic peening treatment ( UPT ) in three directions is proposed to refine the large columnar prior-β grains and secondary α grains , and to improve anisotropy in tensile properties . 
The experimental results showed that UPT in three directions applied to each weld right after arc extinguishing has a minor influence on the surface appearance , which shows no apparent plastic deformation , but has a great improvement in grain refinement . 
The changes in microstructure and dislocations of thin wall structure treated by UPT in three directions were observed . 
By comparing with those without UPT , the main causes for refinement of columnar prior-β and secondary α grains was explored , namely mechanical effects of ultrasonic at the temperature range of α ’ dissolution temperature Tdiss – liquidus temperature Tl . 
Specimens with UPT have better properties , higher loads with the same indentation displacement in nano-indentation tests , an increase in ultimate tensile strength and a reduction in anisotropic percentage in tensile tests . 
2Cr13 thin-wall part with defect-free was additively manufactured by robot-assisted CMT technology . 
Martensite coarsened gradually from FZ to CZ while only ultra-fine acicular martensite in the top layer . 
A random crystallographic orientation in the middle region while a slightly fiber texture in the top layer Mechanical properties were evolved periodically due to the periodic microstructural evolution . 
Based on cold metal transfer ( CMT ) welding , wire-arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) technology was adopted to manufacture 2Cr13 part . 
The spatial periodicity of the microstructural evolution and the anti-indentation properties was explored . 
The results show that the as-deposited part was featured by periodic martensite laths within the block-shaped ferrite matrix in the inner layers , followed by epitaxial ferrite grains containing ultra-fine acicular martensite in the top layer only . 
A slightly decreased Fe intensity was caused by local elemental segregation during the re-melting process ; the homogeneity of Fe and Cr was attributed to similar cooling conditions in the top layer . 
Elongated ferrite grains exhibited a slight fiber texture in the top layer and a random crystallographic orientation in the middle region . 
The anti-indentation properties evolved periodically due to the periodic microstructural characteristics . 
The obtained experimental results confirmed higher anti-indentation properties of the as-deposited part following comparison with the as-annealed base metal , while the elastic moduli of samples were not significantly different . 
Titanium alloys have high strength to low weight ratio , good creep resistance and high temperature strength properties . 
Based on these properties , Ti alloys are used as a ‘ workhorse ’ material in the aerospace industry such as engine blades , landing gear assemblies , large structural parts , airframe and drums etc . 
Traditional fabrication methods of Ti alloy are expensive and inferior in their mechanical properties . 
Due to continuous development in science and technology , many researchers have been attracted towards Wire Feed Additive Manufacturing ( WFAM ) for the fabrication of titanium and its alloys . 
WFAM has set a new trend by accomplishing the production demand of components from medium to large scale with moderate complexity . 
This additive manufacturing technology generally employes for high material utilization and higher deposition . 
This state of art highlights the remarkable achievements of WFAM processes followed by their effect of process parameters , microstructural changes , residual stresses and mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V alloy . 
Accurate on-line weld defects detection is still challenging for robotic welding manufacturing due to the complexity of weld defects . 
This paper studied deep learning–based on-line defects detection for aluminum alloy in robotic arc welding using Convolutional Neural Networks ( CNN ) and weld images . 
Firstly , an image acquisition system was developed to simultaneously collect weld images , which can provide more information of the real-time weld images from different angles including top front , top back and back seam . 
Then , a new CNN classification model with 11 layers based on weld image was designed to identify weld penetration defects . 
In order to improve the robustness and generalization ability of the CNN model , weld images from different welding current and feeding speed were captured for the CNN model . 
Based on the actual industry challenges such as the instability of welding arc , the complexity of the welding environment and the random changing of plate gap condition , two kinds of data augmentation including noise adding and image rotation were used to boost the CNN dataset while parameters optimization was carried out . 
Instead of decreasing the interference from arc light as in traditional way , the CNN model has taken full use of those arc lights by combining them in a various way to form the complementary features . 
Test results shows that the CNN model has better performance than our previous work with the mean classification accuracy of 99.38 % . 
This paper can provide some guidance for on-line detection of manufacturing quality in metal additive manufacturing ( AM ) and laser welding . 
A high temperature gas-to-gas manifold-microchannel heat exchanger was fabricated . 
The heat exchanger core was 3D printed using Inconel 718 through DMLS . 
The heat exchanger was tested at 600 °C with inlet pressure of 450 kPa . 
The experimental results validated the numerical model . 
25 % higher heat transfer density compared to conventional plate fin heat exchangers . 
This work presents an additively manufactured manifold-microchannel heat exchanger made of Inconel 718 and experimentally tested for high temperature aerospace applications . 
The heat exchanger core with a size of 66 mm × 74 mm × 27 mm was fabricated as a single piece through the direct metal laser sintering process . 
Successful welding of additively manufactured headers with the heat exchanger core and conventionally manufactured flanges was demonstrated through the fabrication of the unit . 
The heat exchanger was tested using nitrogen ( N2 ) on the hot-side and air on the cold-side as the working fluids . 
A maximum heat duty of 2.78 kW and a maximum overall heat transfer coefficient of 1000 W/m2K were achieved during the experiments . 
The decent agreement between the experimental and the numerical results demonstrates the validity of the numerical analysis model used for heat transfer and pressure drop prediction of the additively manufactured manifold-microchannel heat exchanger . 
Compared to conventional plate fin heat exchangers , nearly 25 % improvement in heat transfer density— the ratio between heat duty and mass ( Q/m ) —was noted at a coefficient of performance ( COP ) of 62 . 
A 3D heat and fluid flow model is developed for the multilayer deposition of wire and arc additive manufacture . 
Utilizing a modified double ellipsoidal heat source model which shows better adaptability to free surface deformation . 
Predicting the morphology of molten pool and deposited bead in WAAM process using CFD model for the first time . 
Conduction is the dominant method of heat dissipation compared to convection and radiation to the air during deposition . 
A three-dimensional numerical model has been developed to investigate the fluid flow and heat transfer behaviors in multilayer deposition of plasma arc welding ( PAW ) based wire and arc additive manufacture ( WAAM ) . 
The volume of fluid ( VOF ) and porosity enthalpy methods are employed to track the molten pool free surface and solidification front , respectively . 
A modified double ellipsoidal heat source model is utilized to ensure constant arc heat input in calculation in the case that molten pool surface dynamically changes . 
Transient simulations were conducted for the 1st , 2nd and 21st layer depositions . 
The shape and size of deposited bead and weld pool were predicted and compared with experimental results . 
The results show that for each layer of deposition the Marangoni force plays the most important role in affecting fluid flow , conduction is the dominant method of heat dissipation compared to convection and radiation to the air . 
As the layer number increases , the length and width of molten pool and the width of deposited bead increase , whilst the layer height decreases . 
In high layer deposition , where side support is absent , the depth of the molten pool at the rear part is almost flat in the Y direction . 
The profile of the deposited bead is mainly determined by static pressure caused by gravity and surface tension pressure , therefore the bead profile is nearly circular . 
The simulated profiles and size dimensions of deposited bead and molten pool were validated with experimental weld appearance , cross-sectional images and process camera images . 
Wire-based directed energy deposition additive manufacturing techniques ( AM ) permit the rapid production of large-scale structural components which are not currently possible using the more common powder bed fusion ( PBF ) AM methods . 
However , due to larger melt pool widths and higher energy inputs than PBF methods , local thermal history effects produce significant location-dependent microstructure , porosity , and mechanical behavior that necessitates thorough quantification of this emergent technology . 
Wire + Arc Additive Manufacturing ( WAAM ) was used to produce austenitic stainless-steel single bead walls in order to statistically quantify the variation of critical material properties within the build . 
Individual grain geometric properties evaluated using electron back scatter diffraction at different points in the build were well fit by a three-parameter Weibull cumulative distribution function , yet sufficiently different from averaged values . 
X-ray diffraction for each location disclosed a strong wire texture in the build direction , leading to anisotropic elastic moduli values that were well described by directionally-dependent modulus predictions obtained from diffraction peak analysis . 
Location-dependent mechanical behavior was examined and accurately captured by an elasto-viscoplastic model based on the Fast-Fourier Transforms ( EvpFFT ) using the local microstructure orientation data as input . 
Overall , a high-quality build was realized , with minimal porosity of less than 0.32 % , and median yield and tensile strength values of approximately 320.4 ± 8.0 MPa and 531.6 ± 8.2 MPa , respectively . 
Additively manufactured components made of metallic material are subject to special consideration for many R & D departments , since the process control is not yet sufficiently reliable and therefore an extensive quality assurance is necessary . 
For this reason , few structural components for aviation have been established so far . 
In this paper , a feasibility study for the use of laser metal deposition ( LMD ) for the additive manufacturing of a fuselage made of aluminum is carried out . 
The redistribution of alloying elements and the crystallographic characterizations in wire and arc additive manufactured ( WAAM ) super duplex stainless steel ( SDSS ) was investigated from the wire to the final as-deposited structure . 
The results showed that elemental partitioning between austenite and ferrite was suppressed in the last layer and the solidified droplet . 
The high Ni content but low Cr and N contents in the initial state of the intragranular austenite ( IGA ) confirmed the predominance of the chromium nitrides acted as the nucleation sites . 
Gathering of nitrogen was found more distinct in the coarsening IGA , Widmanstätten austenite ( WA ) than the grain boundary austenite ( GBA ) . 
The columnar epitaxial ferrite presented a strong < 001 > texture in the deposition direction , while the < 001 > and < 101 > orientations was found in the austenite . 
Random orientations of the intragranular secondary austenite was revealed . 
The Rotated Cube texture of the austenite grains were consumed by the “ recrystallization ” textures ( Brass , Rotated Brass , Cu , R , E , and F ) caused by the austenite reformation . 
The low-angle interphase boundaries between austenite and ferrite were predominated in the as-deposited wall , and , at which , the K–S orientation took the crucial part . 
A Taylor factor analysis revealed that through fabrication via additive process , the austenite became oriented “ harder ” and contributed most to good mechanical properties . 
The textured microstructure contributed about a 2.6 % higher engineering strain in the Z direction and a 27.8 MPa higher yield strength in the X direction . 
As-deposited Wire + Arc Additively Manufactured ( WAAM ) Inconel ( IN ) 718 contains Laves phase in the microstructure . 
A modified post-deposition heat treatment successfully dissolved Laves phase without precipitating δ phase . 
Changes to the grain structure through heat treatments reduced anisotropy in elevated temperature tensile properties . 
Elevated temperature tensile properties of WAAM IN 718 meet minimum specifications for cast but not for wrought material . 
Wire + Arc Additive Manufacturing ( WAAM ) can be used to create large free-form components out of specialist materials such as nickel-base superalloys . 
Inconel ( IN ) 718 is well suited for the WAAM process due to its excellent weldability . 
However , during deposition , WAAM IN718 is susceptible to micro-segregation , leading to undesirable Laves phase formation in the interdendritic regions . 
Further , the WAAM process encourages columnar grain growth and the development of a strong fibre texture , leading to anisotropy in grain structure . 
This unfavourable microstructure can be addressed through specialised post-deposition homogenisation heat treatments . 
A new modified heat treatment was found to be effective in dissolving Laves phase , whereas a standard treatment precipitated δ phase . 
Tensile test results revealed that Laves and δ phases lead to low ductility when present in a precipitation-hardened matrix . 
The modified heat treatment also reduced the anisotropy in grain structure , leading to almost isotropic elevated temperature tensile properties , which meet minimum specifications for conventional cast but not for wrought material . 
Specialised post-deposition heat treatments , which address the unique microstructure of WAAM IN718 , are crucial to achieving optimal mechanical properties . 
Powder bed fusion process is one of the basic technique associated with additive manufacturing . 
It follows the basic principle of manufacturing the product layer by layer and their fusion . 
A heat source focuses its heat over a powder base material and heats the selected cross section area . 
Sources like laser beam , electron beam and infrared beam are used as heating tool . 
The process of heating allows the powder to take the shape of the intended object . 
Powder bed fusion process is compatible to every engineering material such as metals , ceramics polymers , composites etc . 
this technique is widely used in many industrial sectors such as aerospace , energy sector , transportation etc . 
A comprehensive overview on powder bed fusion process is presented in this review paper . 
Other popular techniques like selective laser melting ( SLM ) , selective laser sintering ( SLS ) , and electron beam melting ( EBM ) are also reviewed . 
Wire and arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) , using cold metal transfer ( CMT ) as heat source , exhibits a great potential for additive manufacturing of magnesium alloys due to low heat input . 
With the purpose of revealing the relationship between the microstructure and mechanical properties of WAAMed AZ31 material , the present study has been carried out . 
The average primary dendrite arm spacing increases from 17 μm at the bottom to 39 μm at the top of the deposit , and the volume fraction of the interdendritic eutectic decreases from 52.1 % to 39.3 % . 
The microstructure of each layer except the top layer consists of vertical columnar dendrites and direction-changed columnar dendrites in sequence . 
The top layer appears equiaxed dendrites due to columnar to equiaxed transition ( CET ) . 
The tensile properties present obvious anisotropic characteristics because of the epitaxial columnar dendritic growth along the building direction . 
The tensile properties also show obvious variation from the bottom to the top of the deposit because of the differing microstructures in different regions . 
The results are further analyzed in detail through the microstructure evolution resulted from the new manufacturing method . 
Using Electrical Discharge Machining in combination with forming is an option to manufacture a U-shaped First Wall without welding . 
Additive Manufacturing ( e.g . 
Selective Laser Melting and Metal Powder Application ) provides promising options for nuclear fusion applications . 
Selective Laser Melting is suitable to manufacture high complex and thin walled segments with internal channel structures . 
Metal Powder Application provides cost effective options to build First Wall relevant components . 
Different manufacturing routes are investigated at the KIT INR for the realization of First Walls ( FW ) for nuclear fusion components , such as the ITER Test Blanket Module ( TBM ) and DEMO Breeding Blankets ( BB ) for the Helium Cooled Pebble Bed ( HCPB ) Breeding concept . 
One conventional manufacturing route mainly basing of Electrical Discharge Machining ( EDM ) and forming was demonstrated successfully . 
Therefore , options also to apply Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) as alternative were investigated . 
This paper compares the HCPB reference concept for FW fabrication to innovative concepts basing on AM . 
The solid-state friction stir welding ( FSW ) process was used to join Al–Si12 parts fabricated via the selective laser melting ( SLM ) technique . 
The effect of the welding process on microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of the samples is investigated in present work . 
Microstructural studies demonstrate that FSW is capable of changing Si phase morphologies ( i.e . 
shape and size ) resulting in various mechanical properties . 
The stir zone of the welded joint shows significantly lower micro-hardness in comparison to the as-built SLM samples . 
Correspondingly , the friction stir welding process results in significant reduction of tensile strength , while ductility is strongly improved . 
The fully-reversed strain-controlled low-cycle fatigue ( LCF ) tests imply that at low strain amplitudes the FSW and SLM samples show almost the same fatigue life , while at the high strain amplitudes the SLM samples show superior LCF performance . 
Fracture analysis of fatigued samples reveals that the near-surface pores lead to the crack initiation in both SLM and FSW cases . 
Various methods have been reported to join carbon fiber reinforced polymer ( CFRP ) composites with aluminum alloy ( AA ) , with strengths ranging from 13 MPa to 112 MPa . 
This paper presents a new method for joining carbon fiber reinforced composites and metals using ultrasonic additive manufacturing ( UAM ) . 
Although UAM is a metal 3D printing process , it is applied here to produce continuous CF-AA transition joints that can have uniform thickness across the CF and AA constituents . 
Joint strength is achieved by mechanical interlocking of CF loops within the AA matrix ; tensile tests demonstrate that UAM CFRP-AA joints reach strengths of 129.5 MPa . 
The dry CF fabric extending from these joints can be laid up and cured into a CFRP part , whereas the AA can be welded to metal structures using traditional metal welding techniques – hence their designation as “ transition joints. 
” This approach enables the incorporation of CFRP parts into vehicle structures without requiring modifications to existing metal welding infrastructure . 
Two failure modes , CF tow failure and AA failure , have been identified . 
It is shown that the joint failure mode can be designed for maximum strength or maximum energy dissipation by adjusting the ratio of embedded CF to AA matrix . 
Welded joints of SLM and CR stainless steels were produced by laser welding . 
A comparison of keyhole and heat conduction laser welding was performed . 
The influence of pre-heat treatment on the strength and weldability was revealed . 
The hardness of welding seams produced by head conduction is 500 HV , by keyhole – 280 HV . 
The welded joints strength is comparable to the SLM metal strength ( 1450 MPa ) . 
The details produced by additive manufacturing have limitations in sizes , if you produce large details then there are large residual stresses . 
It is also economically advantageous to produce complexly configured details by additive manufacturing and then weld them to rolled or wrought cheaper details . 
The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of pre-heat treatment on laser beam weldability of Selective Laser Welding ( SLM ) stainless steel to Cold Rolled ( CR ) stainless steel . 
The results of metallographic studies and mechanical tests of produced welds are presented . 
The results showed that the pre-heat treatment of SLM workpieces affects the welded joint strength . 
The laser welding mode , keyhole or conduction , affected the microstructure and microhardness of the welds . 
With the recent rise in the demand for additive manufacturing ( AM ) , the need for reliable simulation tools to support experimental efforts grows steadily . 
Computational welding mechanics approaches can simulate the AM processes but are generally not validated for AM-specific effects originating from multiple heating and cooling cycles . 
To increase confidence in the outcomes and to use numerical simulation reliably , the result quality needs to be validated against experiments for in-situ and post-process cases . 
In this article , a validation is demonstrated for a structural thermomechanical simulation model on an arbitrarily curved Directed Energy Deposition ( DED ) part : at first , the validity of the heat input is ensured and subsequently , the model ’ s predictive quality for in-situ deformation and the bulging behaviour is investigated . 
For the in-situ deformations , 3D-Digital Image Correlation measurements are conducted that quantify periodic expansion and shrinkage as they occur . 
The results show a strong dependency of the local stiffness of the surrounding geometry . 
The numerical simulation model is set up in accordance with the experiment and can reproduce the measured 3-dimensional in-situ displacements . 
Furthermore , the deformations due to removal from the substrate are quantified via 3D-scanning , exhibiting considerable distortions due to stress relaxation . 
Finally , the prediction of the deformed shape is discussed in regards to bulging simulation : to improve the accuracy of the calculated final shape , a novel extension of the model relying on the modified stiffness of inactive upper layers is proposed and the experimentally observed bulging could be reproduced in the finite element model . 
High-performance components from titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V are used in many industries , particularly in aerospace , but also in the automotive and medical market . 
Traditionally , such components are produced by hot forging and subsequent post processing . 
The multi-stage forging process requires several expensive dies and leads to components with a high material oversize . 
Therefore , costly machining operations with machining removal up to more than 90 % are necessary to produce the final geometry . 
New technologies , such as additive manufacturing ( AM ) , could support traditional process chains and could enable a more resource-efficient production . 
However , in additive manufacturing production cycles are still long and manufacturing costs are very high , especially for larger parts . 
Thus , the production by AM is often limited to low quantities and smaller components . 
To overcome the above-mentioned disadvantages the present study proposes a hybrid manufacturing route , combining the advantages of forging and AM . 
The new manufacturing route could reduce the number of processing steps and forging dies , and additionally could provide efficient near-net-shape production . 
These features , such as ribs or other structural or functional geometries , will be added by additive manufacturing . 
The present study investigates the use of powder laser metal deposition ( p-LMD ) and wire-arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) for hybrid manufacturing of Ti-6Al-4V aerospace forgings . 
BackgroundAdditive manufacturing ( AM ) is a rapidly expanding new technology involving challenges to occupational health . 
Here , metal exposure in an AM facility with large-scale metallic component production was investigated during two consecutive years with preventive actions in between.MethodsGravimetric analyzes measured airborne particle concentrations , and filters were analyzed for metal content . 
Particles from recycled powder were characterized . 
Airborne particle concentrations ( < 300 nm ) showed transient peaks in the AM facility but were lower than those of the welding facility . 
Particle characterization of recycled powder showed fragmentation and condensates enriched in volatile metals . 
Biomonitoring showed a nonsignificant increase in the level of metals in urine in AM operators . 
Dermal cobalt and a trend for increasing urine metals during Workweek Year 1 , but not in Year 2 , indicated reduced exposure after preventive actions.ConclusionGravimetric analyses showed low total and inhalable dust exposure in AM operators . 
However , transient emission of smaller particles constitutes exposure risks . 
Preventive actions implemented by the company reduced the workers ' metal exposure despite unchanged emissions of particles , indicating a need for careful design and regulation of the AM environments . 
HDPE polymer HX is fabricated using layer-by-layer line welding of plastic sheets . 
The polymer HX shows superior air-side performance over plane plate fin surface . 
In addition to their low cost and weight , polymer heat exchangers offer good anticorrosion and antifouling properties . 
In this work , a cost effective air-water polymer heat exchanger made of thin polymer sheets using layer-by-layer line welding with a laser through an additive manufacturing process was fabricated and experimentally tested . 
The flow channels were made of 150 μm-thick high density polyethylene sheets , which were 15.5 cm wide and 29 cm long . 
The experimental results show that the overall heat transfer coefficient of 35–120 W/m2 K is achievable for an air-water fluid combination for air-side flow rate of 3–24 L/s and water-side flow rate of 12.5 mL/s . 
In addition , by fabricating a very thin wall heat exchanger ( 150 μm ) , the wall thermal resistance , which usually becomes the limiting factor on polymer heat exchangers , was calculated to account for only 3 % of the total thermal resistance . 
A comparison of the air-side heat transfer coefficient of the present polymer heat exchanger with some of the commercially available plain plate fin heat exchanger surfaces suggests that its performance in general is superior to that of common plain plate fin surfaces . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) offers the possibility of locally reinforcing sheet metal or sheet metal products by adding patches that are metallurgically bonded to the substrate . 
Due to the high design freedom of AM , patches can be easily adapted to loads in geometry and thickness . 
However , the heat input and the high cooling rates during AM processes have a strong influence on the microstructure in the patch as well as in the substrate , which will affect forming properties . 
The aim of this work is to investigate the influence of patches produced by laser material deposition ( LMD ) on formability of micro-alloyed sheet metals . 
After determining a suitable process window for metallurgically bonded patches without cracks and pores , investigations were carried out on the microstructure and mechanical properties of reinforced samples . 
This work includes metallographic examinations using optical microscopy , hardness measurements and tensile tests . 
The formability of sheets with local reinforcement was investigated by stretching and Nakajima tests . 
The heat input creates a heat affected zone ( HAZ ) directly next to the patches with a reduced strength , caused by recrystallization that may lead to failure in the forming process and thus limits the forming capacity of locally reinforced sheet metals . 
A subsequent laser heat treatment can homogenize the properties in the HAZ . 
Ti-6Al-4V samples produced by electron beam melting ( EBM ) are welded using solid-state friction welding ( FW ) process . 
The microstructure of the weld sample shows the presence of fine equiaxed α grains with irregular β phase . 
Microstructural investigations reveal a pronounced change in the shape and size of the α phase in the weld metal as-compared to the base material along with the disappearance of columnar prior β grains . 
Such variations in the microstructure significantly change the mechanical properties of the FW material . 
The hardness in the weld zone increases and a decrease of hardness is observed along the heat affected zone ( HAZ ) with respect to the base metal as expected . 
Similarly , the room temperature tensile tests show an improvement of ductility in the welded EBM samples . 
However , the yield and the ultimate strength show a marginal drop in the welded samples compared to the as-prepared EBM specimens . 
The present work demonstrates that solid-state FW process not only permits successful joining of additively manufactured materials , but also helps in improving their ductility . 
Laser zone with refined grains and more uniform element distribution forms by laser-arc hybrid additive manufacturing . 
Outstanding micro-hardness and tensile strength can be obtained by laser-arc hybrid additive manufacturing . 
Finer grains and significant decreasing of element segregation in laser zone can help to strengthen mechanical properties . 
4043 AlSi alloy samples are fabricated by laser-arc hybrid additive manufacturing and wire arc additive manufacturing . 
To investigate the influence of laser energy on the fabricated sample , the microstructure evaluation and mechanical properties are studied . 
After the input of laser energy , there are laser zones with finer grains and reduced Si segregation . 
As a result , the Si phases at grain boundaries in laser zone are smaller than that in other zones . 
And it is found that semi-coherent interface between Al and Si phases with crystal orientation relations , [ 110 ] Al∥ [ 110 ] Si and ( 111 ) Al∥ ( 220 ) Si , indicating the Si phase tends to grow along ( 111 ) Al plane . 
The results of mechanical properties show that the micro-hardness in laser zone is 54.3 HV0.05 , with the increment of 19.08 % compared to that in heat-affected zone . 
And the tensile strength , yield strength and elongation after the input of laser energy are 163.39 ± 1.68 MPa , 75.60 ± 4.91 MPa and 17.38 ± 5.44 % , which are 7.56 % , 8.45 % and 3.45 % higher than that without laser . 
The improved mechanical properties are due to the finer gains , reduced Si segregation and the crack deflection in LAHAM samples . 
The structure and properties of welded and additively manufactured alloys are affected by the microstructural evolution in the fusion zone ( FZ ) and heat affected zone ( HAZ ) . 
The motion of the liquid pool and the interdependence of grain growth in both the solid and liquid regions are important in the evolution of the final grain structure . 
Previous investigations of microstructure evolution have been limited to either the HAZ or the FZ and in many cases in idealized isothermal systems . 
Here we report the evolution of grain structure and topology in three dimensions in both the FZ and the HAZ considering the motion of the liquid pool . 
Temporal and spatial distributions of temperature obtained from a well-tested heat transfer and liquid metal flow calculation are combined with Monte Carlo and topology calculations in a computationally efficient manner . 
The computed results are tested against independent experimental data for arc welding of an aluminum alloy . 
The average size of the columnar grains in the FZ and the equiaxed grains in the HAZ are shown to decrease with increasing scanning speed . 
For a given weld , the size and aspect ratio of the columnar grains in the longitudinal and horizontal planes are shown to decrease with distance from the weld interface . 
It is further shown that the grain size distributions and topological class distributions in the HAZ are largely unaffected by the temporal and spatial variations of the temperature created by different welding parameters . 
In laser welding and other processes , such as cladding and additive manufacturing , the weld bead geometry ( depth of penetration and weld width ) can be controlled with different parameters . 
A common practice is to develop process parameters for a particular application based on an engineering approach using the system parameters i.e . 
laser power and travel speed . 
This study is focused on understanding of the phenomena controlling the weld profile in conduction welding for a wide range of beam diameters from 0.07 mm to 5.50 mm . 
It has been shown that the weld bead geometry can be controlled by the spatial and temporal distribution of laser energy on the surface of workpiece , such as power density , interaction time and energy density . 
This means that similar depths of penetration can be achieved with various optical set-ups . 
It has been also found that it is more difficult to achieve pure conduction welds with small beam diameters , which are typically used in powder bed additive manufacturing , due to high conduction losses and low vaporisation threshold . 
Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing ( UAM ) is a hybrid manufacturing process that involves the layer-by-layer ultrasonic welding of metal foils in the solid state with periodic CNC machining to achieve the desired 3D shape . 
UAM enables the fabrication of metal smart structures , because it allows the embedding of various components into the metal matrix , due to the high degree of plastic metal flow and the relatively low temperatures encountered during the layer bonding process . 
To further the embedding capabilities of UAM , in this paper we examine the ultrasonic welding of aluminium foils with features machined prior to bonding . 
These pre-machined features can be stacked layer-by-layer to create pockets for the accommodation of fragile components , such as electronic circuitry , prior to encapsulation . 
This manufacturing approach transforms UAM into a “ form-then-bond ” process . 
By studying the deformation of aluminium foils during UAM , a statistical model was developed that allowed the prediction of the final location , dimensions and tolerances of pre-machined features for a set of UAM process parameters . 
The predictive power of the model was demonstrated by designing a cavity to accommodate an electronic component ( i.e . 
a surface mount resistor ) prior to its encapsulation within the metal matrix . 
We also further emphasised the importance of the tensioning force in the UAM process . 
The current work paves the way for the creation of a novel system for the fabrication of three-dimensional electronic circuits embedded into an additively manufactured complex metal composite . 
Additive manufacturing of metals is an innovative near-net-shaped manufacturing technology used for producing final solid objects by depositing successive layers of material melted in powder or wire form using a focused heat source directed from an electron beam , laser beam , or plasma or electric arc . 
Wire arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) techniques , although have lesser precision as compared to laser or electron beam techniques but have the advantage of lower cost and lesser time required . 
In this research , gas metal arc welding ( GMAW ) process has been used using AWS ER70S-6 electrode wire to create a multi-layer single pass structure after controlling the parameters including current , voltage and travel speed so that uniform height is attained throughout the weld bead . 
The resulting material may have different directional mechanical properties because of factors including different penetration properties and bonding strength and also preheating and post-heating effects of successive layers . 
This study focuses on the impact toughness of the resulting material . 
Charpy impact test is carried out on the samples taken in both along the direction of deposition and in the direction perpendicular to it to analyze the impact toughness in different directions . 
To further investigate the behavior of the structure , Brinell hardness , metallography and fractography have been performed . 
The results show that material has high impact toughness with very ductile behavior . 
High-efficiency elastocaloric refrigeration requires high-performance elastocaloric materials with both large surface areas to promote heat exchange rate and large elastocaloric effects to increase the amount of heat transfer . 
Ni-Ti shape memory alloys ( SMAs ) are the most promising elastocaloric materials but they are difficult to process by conventional methods due to their poor manufacturability . 
Here , we successfully developed Ni-Ti SMAs with large elastocaloric effects by additive manufacturing which has the capability to fabricate complex geometries with large surface areas . 
The phase transformation temperatures of these additively manufactured Ni-Ti SMAs , fabricated by selective laser melting ( SLM ) , can be tuned by varying the SLM processing parameters and/or post heat treatments and thus tunable large elastocaloric effects were achieved at different temperatures , which can be used for different applications . 
Owing to its large transformation entropy change and high yield strength as a result of precipitation hardening , the aged SLM fabricated alloy exhibits a remarkably large elastocaloric effect with an adiabatic temperature change as high as 23.2 K , which is among the highest values reported for all Ni-Ti SMAs fabricated by both conventional methods and additive manufacturing . 
Furthermore , by virtue of the high yield strength and low stress hysteresis of the aged alloy , this large elastocaloric effect shows good stability during cycling . 
The achievement of such large elastocaloric effects in alloys fabricated by near-net-shape additive manufacturing may accelerate the implementation of high-efficiency elastocaloric refrigeration . 
This study is instructive for the development of advanced high-performance solid-state refrigeration materials by additive manufacturing . 
Due to the practicability of economically generating large-scale metal components with relatively high deposition rates , consequential progress has been made in the perspective of the Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing ( WAAM ) process . 
This article reviews the looming research on WAAM techniques and the commonly used metallic feedstock materials . 
The frequent defects that are produced in components during the WAAM process using different alloys are characterized including deformity , porosity , and cracking . 
Methods for enhancing the fabrication quality of the additively manufactured components are also discussed , with the consideration of the requirements of the distinct alloys . 
The implementation of the standardized Conventional Heat Treatment procedure to mitigate the defects in the WAAM process and in capturing the future possibilities that are efficient has been discussed . 
The unification of materials and manufacturing process to produce defect-free and structurally-sound deposited parts remains a crucial effort in the future . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) , through directed energy deposition , supports planned composition changes between locations within a single component , allowing for functionally graded materials ( FGMs ) to be developed and fabricated . 
The formation of deleterious phases along a particular composition path can cause significant cracking during the AM build process that makes the composition path unviable to produce these FGMs , but it is challenging to predict which phases will be present in as-built additively manufactured parts by analyzing only equilibrium phase relations . 
Solute segregation during solidification can lead to the formation of non-equilibrium phases that are stable at compositions far from the nominal composition of the melt , leading to crack formation . 
We used this tool to compare the non-equilibrium phases predicted to form during the AM build process using the Scheil-Gulliver model with experimentally measured phases at several locations with different composition in a Ti-6Al-4V to Invar-36 FGM and a commercially pure Ti to Invar-36 FGM . 
We showed that the phases predicted to form by the Scheil-Gulliver model agree better with the experimental results than the predictions made by assuming equilibrium solidification , proving that the Scheil-Gulliver model can be applied to FGMs . 
Further , we demonstrated the use of our Scheil-Gulliver simulation tool as a method of designing FGMs through screening potential FGM pathways by calculating the solidification phase fractions along the experimental gradient path in composition space . 
Ultrasonic additive manufacturing ( UAM ) is a solid-state manufacturing technique employing principles of ultrasonic welding coupled with mechanized tape layering to fabricate fully functional parts . 
However , UAM-fabricated parts often exhibit a reduction in strength when loaded normal to the welding interfaces ( Z-direction ) . 
Here , the effect of hot isostatic pressing ( HIP ) on UAM builds of aluminum alloy was explored . 
Tensile testing and microstructure characterization were conducted ; it was established that HIP eliminated the brittle Z-direction fracture and improved the strength and ductility of the Z-direction specimens . 
HIP eliminated voids and produced recrystallized structure ; however , welding interfaces survived the HIP treatment .

Effects of different stereo matching algorithms on reconstruction accuracy are conducted . 
Molten pool appearance in wire and arc additive manufacturing is reconstructed . 
Robust measurement of layer geometry can help better understand the complex deposition process and provide feedback control to increase process stability of wire and arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) . 
In this study , a virtual binocular vision sensing system is designed to measure the layer width and torch height from top layer simultaneously . 
Considering that stereo matching is the most crucial step for 3-D reconstruction in stereovision sensing , various matching algorithms , i.e . 
The matching algorithms are tested based on the standard datasets , indicating that the highest matching accuracy comes from the GCI matching algorithm . 
Then , a standard cylinder is taken as an example to verify the effectiveness of the sensing system and algorithms . 
Finally , layer geometries in WAAM with various process parameters are determined . 
The width and height errors of layer geometry with the GCI matching algorithm are less than 3.2 % . 
This study will lay a solid foundation for subsequent feedback control for layer geometry in WAAM . 
High-strain-rate deformation in ultrasonic additive manufacturing was analyzed by performing microstructural characterization via electron microscopy . 
The micro-asperities on the top tape surface , which were formed by contact with the sonotrode surface , underwent cyclic deformation in the shear direction at high strain rates during welding with an additional tape . 
This caused plastic flow and crushing of the micro-asperities , and a flattened interface was formed between the upper and lower tapes . 
Further , surface oxide films were fractured and dispersed by ultrasonic vibration , and metallurgical welding was achieved .

A sample of 304L stainless steel manufactured by Laser Engineered Net Shaping ( LENS ) was characterized in 3D using TriBeam tomography . 
The crystallographic , structural , and chemical properties of the as-deposited microstructure have been studied in detail . 
3D characterization reveals complex grain morphologies and large orientation gradients , in excess of 10∘ , that are not easily interpreted from 2D cross-sections alone . 
Misorientations were calculated via a methodology that locates the initial location and orientation of grains that grow during the build process . 
For larger grains , misorientation increased along the direction of solidification . 
For grains with complex morphologies , K-means clustering in orientation space is demonstrated as a useful approach for determining the initial growth orientation . 
The accumulation of misorientation is linked to the solutal and thermal solidification path , offering potential design pathways for novel alloys more suited for additive manufacturing . 
In this study , Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing ( WAAM ) based Directed Energy Deposition ( DED ) process is used to build two parts , tube and wall from 2209 Duplex Stainless Steel . 
Duplex stainless steel is extremely effective against stress corrosion cracking due to existence of an equal portion of austenite and ferrite phases . 
The challenge is monitoring of the process parameters and cooling rate to promote ferrite phase formation . 
To this end , three-dimensional transient thermal models of the additive manufactured ( AM ) parts are presented and the simulated thermal cycles are verified with the experimental results . 
The correlation between the calculated cooling rates and the phases formation in the WAAM parts is studied and revealed . 
The results highlight that slow cooling rate of the built layers at elevated temperatures promote austenite formation significantly in a ferrite matrix . 
Furthermore , the experimental mechanical examinations will illustrate the quality of the WAAM-made parts and compare their mechanical properties with their wrought counter-parts . 
Beam-based processes are popularly used for metal additive manufacturing , but there are significant gaps between their capabilities and the demand from industry and society . 
Examples include solidification issues , anisotropic mechanical properties , and restrictions on powder attributes . 
Non-beam-based additive processes are promising to bridge these gaps . 
In this viewpoint article , we introduce and discuss additive friction stir deposition , which is a fast , scalable , solid-state process that results in refined microstructures and has flexible options for feed materials . 
With comparisons to other additive processes , we discuss its benefits and limitations along with the pathways to widespread implementation of metal additive manufacturing . 
Metal additive manufacturing is nowadays a well-established technology for cutting edge applications in the automotive , aerospace , defense and medical sectors . 
Since additive metal deposition is basically a welding method , which creates parts by successively adding layers of material , there is a chance for defects like pores , cracks , inclusions and lack of fusion to develop . 
As a matter of fact , interlayer and intralayer defects are often observed in additive manufactured components . 
However , if one considers the typical end applications along with the high costs involved in metal additive manufactured components , a “ zero defect ” target is close to mandatory for this technology . 
Planning an inclusion of the integrity assessment right into the additive manufacturing process would allow for quick corrective actions to be performed before the component is completed . 
Some effort has been spent in the quest of an efficient in-process flaw inspection , however , no conventional nondestructive testing ( NDT ) approach has been fully satisfying yet . 
This work suggests an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness of flying laser scanning thermography , when detecting flaws on an Additively Manufactured acetabular cup prosthesis made in titanium alloy , where some defects have been artificially created . 
The rough surface scanned is what ’ s typically left by the additive manufacturing process , and has been left so in order to prove the efficacy of the NDT inspection in real conditions .

130 mm thick welds were manufactured in a nuclear steel using gas-tungsten arc , submerged-arc and electron beam welding . 
Residual stresses were measured using the contour method and incremental deep-hole drilling , before and after PWHT . 
Results show that the effectiveness of PWHT is best assessed on large weld mock-ups . 
In this study we aim to determine how the choice of welding process might impact on the through-life performance of critical nuclear components such as the reactor pressure vessel , steam generators and pressuriser in a pressurised water reactor .

Wire and arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) is a competitive technology for fabricating metallic parts with complex structure and geometry . 
The basis of planning the deposition paths is the beads overlapping model ( BOM ) . 
The existing overlapping models consider only the geometric area of adjacent beads , but ignore the spreading of the melted weld beads . 
The objective of the research was to develop an enhanced BOM ( E.BOM ) for WAAM , which takes the spreading of the weld beads into consideration . 
A deposited bead spreads to the already deposited neighboring bead and as a consequence , its center point deviates from the center point of the fed ( to be melted ) wire . 
Experiments were designed to explore the relationships between the geometries of the beads , and the offset distance between the center of a weld bead and the center of the fed wire . 
An artificial neural network was used to predict the offset distance of a certain weld bead based on the results of the experiments . 
In addition , a reasoning algorithm was implemented to calculate the optimal distance between the centers of adjacent deposition paths in order to achieve a planned center distance between adjacent beads . 
The E.BOM has been tested by validation experiments . 
On the one hand , it improves the surface flatness of layers of MLMB parts produced by WAAM . 
Wire + Arc Additive Manufacture is a suitable technique to manufacture large-scale unalloyed tungsten components The orientation of the wire feeding influences the occurrence of defects as lack of fusion , pores and micro-cracks The orientation of the wire feeding influences the microstructure of the tungsten deposits Front wire feeding allowed to produce fully-dense crack-free unalloyed tungsten deposits The manufacturing of refractory-metals components presents some limitations induced by the materials ' characteristic low-temperature brittleness and high susceptibility to oxidation . 
Powder metallurgy is typically the manufacturing process of choice . 
Recently , Wire + Arc Additive Manufacture has proven capable to produce fully-dense large-scale metal parts at relatively low cost , by using high-quality wire as feedstock . 
In this study , this technique has been used for the production of large-scale tungsten linear structures . 
The orientation of the wire feeding has been studied and optimised to obtain defect-free tungsten deposits . 
In particular , front wire feeding eliminated the occurrence of pores and micro-cracks , when compared to side wire feeding . 
The microstructure , the occurrence of defects and their relationship with the deposition process have also been discussed . 
Despite the repetitive thermal cycles and the inherent brittleness of the material , the as-deposited structures were free from internal cracks and the layer dimensions were stable during the entire deposition process . 
This enabled the production of a relatively large-scale component , with the dimension of 210 × 75 × 12 mm . 
This study has demonstrated that Wire + Arc Additive Manufacture can be used to produce large-scale parts in unalloyed tungsten by complete fusion , presenting a potential alternative to the powder metallurgy manufacturing route . 
An innovative additive manufacturing ( AM ) system using low power pulsed laser assisted MIG arc welding ( L-M ) was proposed to manufacture metal products . 
With the purpose of revealing how width and height dimension of the manufactured thin-wall component are affected by the laser power , the present study has been carried out . 
The width decreased with the increasing of the laser power within a certain range of laser power , and the height increased proportionally under the equal deposition rate . 
The width and height fluctuation reduced while adding the low power laser , both the standard deviation decreased by more than 50％ when the laser power was 400 W. The coefficient of materials utilization was up to 91.12 % , and increased by more than 15 % while using L-M based AM to fabricate thin-wall parts with a proper laser power . 
In comparison with the common GMAW-based AM method , the L-M based AM method shows feasibility to manufacture a narrower thin-wall component with better surface quality and higher stability , and also with higher deposition efficiency . 
Wire and Arc Additive Manufacturing ( WAAM ) is a metal 3D printing technique based on robotic welding . 
This technique yields potential in decreasing material consumption due to its high material efficiency and freedom of shape . 
Empirical measurements of WAAM , using a deposition rate of 1 kg/h , were performed on site of MX3D . 
The measured power consumption per kg stainless steel is 2.72 kW , of which 1.74 is consumed by the welder , 0.44 by the robotic arm , and 0.54 by the ventilation . 
The material loss was 1.1 % . 
A 98 % argon 2 % CO2 welding gas was used with a flow of 12 l/min.A cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Assessment ( LCA ) was performed . 
To give this assessment context , green sand casting and CNC milling were additionally assessed , through literature and databases . 
The purpose of this study is to develop insight into the environmental impact of WAAM . 
Results indicate that , in terms of total ReCiPe endpoints , the environmental impact of producing a kg of stainless steel 308 l product using WAAM is comparable to green sand casting . 
It equals CNC milling with a material utilization fraction of 0.75 . 
Stainless steel is the main cause of environmental damage in all three techniques , emphasizing the importance of WAAM 's mass reduction potential . 
When environmentally comparing the three techniques for fulfilling a certain function , optimized designs should be introduced for each manufacturing technique .

Method of tensile triangles was applied to weld shape design . 
Method of tensile triangles and low transformation temperature weld metal were combined for weld joint design . 
Effect of interpass temperature on residual stress in welded joint was investigated . 
Stress concentration and residual stress have a significant influence on fatigue life of welded joints . 
In order to reduce the stress concentration of welded joints , a mathematical design method of tensile triangles ( MTT ) based on bionics was applied to weld shape design . 
Accordingly , the stress concentration of various weld beads in the corner boxing welded joint and the fillet welded T-joint was dissected using our in-house FEM software JWRIAN . 
It was found that there existed a large stress concentration in the conventional welded joints , whereas those welded joints with elongated weld bead were accompanied by a lower stress concentration , especially for elongated weld bead with MTT design . 
Furthermore , among the weld shapes of the corner boxing fillet welded joint , the rectangle shape of weld bead had the minimum stress concentration factor ( 1.05 ) . 
For the fillet welded T-joint with MTT design , the stress concentration of weld toe decreased dramatically with the increase of the index of designed shape , but there was a minor difference of stress concentration at weld root between the weld beads with MTT design . 
In addition , application of low transformation temperature ( LTT ) weld metal utilizing martensitic transformation to the fillet welded T-joints can produce compressive residual stress at weld toe .

The boxes were crushed laterally until failure using a spherical actuator . 
The considered material and finite element models were proved well suited for the prediction of the structural response of the additively manufactured components in the studied scenario . 
Wire and arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) is an efficient technique for fabricating large and complex components that are applied in the manufacturing industry . 
In this study , anisotropic mechanical properties of a low-carbon high-strength steel component fabricated by WAAM were investigated via mechanical testing , and the transversal and longitudinal deformation behavior of the component were studied using the digital image correlation ( DIC ) method . 
Additionally , the features of microstructure , texture , and fracture mode of the inter-layer area and deposited area were also investigated to reveal the mechanism of anisotropy . 
The results showed the mechanical properties of longitudinal specimens were inferior to that of the transversal specimens . 
Several strain concentration zones in the longitudinal specimen were relevant to the inter-layer characteristics observed from the fracture surface and macrostructure , which was confirmed by the strain evolution recorded by DIC . 
The inter-layer areas were proved to be the weak link in the deposited component by scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) and electron backscatter diffraction ( EBSD ) analysis results , including various phase composition , phase morphology , misorientation angle , grain size , Schmid factor , and texture . 
Finally , based on the fractography analysis , anisotropy resulted from inter-layer zones is also confirmed via the comparison of transversal and longitudinal fracture morphology . 
In the present work , a novel direct energy deposition method for metal additive manufacturing is developed employing laminar plasma as the heat source . 
With a combination of modified process parameters , a high-performance 308L stainless steel component with four hollow straight walls is prepared . 
The behavior of phase formation , microstructure , density and mechanical properties of the samples with different heights were investigated . 
Transformation from columnar to equiaxed dendrites can be observed as the height of wall increases from the substrate to about 30 mm . 
The average density of the sample reaches 98.3 % . 
Anisotropic property is observed in the bottom and middle regions , while the top region is isotropic . 
Laser welding–brazing of Ti/Al butt joints was performed with coaxial Al–10Si–Mg powders feeding . 
The experimental results indicated that a sound Ti/Al butt joint could be obtained by an additive layer approach . 
The influence of the laser melting deposition layers on the weld appearance , interfacial microstructure and tensile properties were investigated . 
The morphology and thickness distributions of the interfacial intermetallic compounds ( IMC ) at the brazing interface along the thickness direction of the joint varied with the number of deposition layers . 
Continuous serrated IMC was obtained in joints produced by seven deposition layers , and the IMC layer was distributed homogenously along the thickness direction . 
The microstructure of the IMC layer was composed of a nanosized granular Ti7Al5Si12 phase and serrated Ti ( Al , Si ) 3 phase . 
The maximum tensile joint strength reached 240 MPa , 80 % of that of the aluminum base metal , and the lower tensile strength of the other joints was caused by insufficient IMC layer or a porosity defect . 
The bypass-coupled wire arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) process was studied , and the arc characteristics and droplet transfer behavior during the deposition process were examined . 
The effects of the bypass current , wire feeding speed , wire feeding height , and wire feeding angle on the droplet transfer mode were investigated via a single variable experiment . 
There are two primary modes of droplet transfer during the deposition process : free droplet transfer and bridging transfer . 
When the transfer process is in the bridging transfer mode , a smooth deposition wall is obtained . 
As the wire feeding speed increases , the transfer mode of the droplet gradually changes from the free transfer mode to the bridging transfer mode . 
The larger the distance between the wire tip and the surface of the base metal , the higher the wire feed speed required to achieve bridging transfer . 
There is a linear relationship between the droplet diameter and the cubic root of the wire feeding speed . 
Finally , the droplet transfer behavior is discussed using droplet force analysis .

A melt pool tracking algorithm is also described for improved calculation efficiency . 
The adaptive algorithm was verified against an analytical solution and Riemann sum integration approach . 
The adaptive integration technique is demonstrated for a highly transient scan pattern at long length and time scales . 
Solidification dynamics are important for determining final microstructure in additively manufactured parts . 
Recently , researchers have adopted semi-analytical approaches for predicting heat conduction effects at length and time scales not accessible to complex multi-physics numerical models . 
The present work focuses on improving a semi-analytical heat conduction model for additive manufacturing by designing an adaptive integration technique . 
The proposed scheme considers material properties , process conditions , and the inherent physical behavior of the transient heat conduction around both stationary and moving heat sources . 
The full algorithm is then implemented and compared against a simple Riemann sum integration scheme for a variety of cases that highlight process and material variations relevant to additive manufacturing . 
The new scheme is shown to have significant improvements in computational efficiency , solution accuracy , and usability .

The hardness level was around 75 kg/mm2 and 70–75 kg/mm2 in the hoorisontal and vertical plane , respectively . 
Reasonable isotropic yield and tensile strength of 145 and 293MPa were achieved , respectively . 
The present study addresses wire arc additive manufacturing of AA5183 aluminium alloy using conventional gas metal arc welding deposition on 20 mm thick AA6082-T6 plate as support material . 
Microscopic examination demonstrates that the process is feasible , but can be further optimized to reduce gas porosity and hot cracking . 
Hardness measurements confirmed relative high hardness , i.e. 
, around 75 kg/mm2 in the horizontal plane , and between 70 and 75 kg/mm2 in the vertical plane down to the AA6082 support plate with 100 kg/mm2 . 
Mechanical testing resulted in yield and tensile strength of 145 and 293 MPa , respectively , with lowest value in the through thickness ( Z ) direction . 
The ductility was high for orientations parallel ( X ) with and perpendicular ( Y ) to the layer deposition direction . 
The thickness of intermetallic compounds ( IMCs ) is one of the main factors affecting the weld quality . 
In addition , the IMC thickness will affect the product functionality , e.g. 
, the thermal or electrical conductivity of the IMC layer can be the limiting factor in the related applications . 
Modeling and prediction of the IMC thickness in the friction stir welding ( FSW ) process is an important role that has not been elaborated in the literature . 
That model is suitable for the pure ( intrinsic ) diffusion process and does not consider the main unique characteristic of FSW , i.e. 
, the stirring and subsequent linear velocity of particles ( that has an impact on the diffusion process ) . 
To address this research gap , first , we develop a new model for the IMC thickness that takes the velocity of particles into account . 
Second , we provide an analysis on the velocity of particles in FSW based on vortex dynamics . 
Third , we analyze the proposed IMC thickness model with experimental data from the literature , discuss the added values of our model , and finally examine a case study . 
Understanding various manufacturing processes can further lead to the improvement of the existing processes and the development of novel processes . 
Inconel 718 thin wall was fabricated by PPAAM . 
Both CET and DCT can be found in the as-built sample . 
Temperature gradient and SDA remelting contribute to grain structure transformation . 
The morphology of Nb-rich phases is sensitive to the grain structure and cooling rate . 
Abundant γ′/γ″ phases precipitate during HT and enhance mechanical properties . 
Inconel 718 thin wall has been fabricated by pulsed plasma arc additive manufacturing ( PPAAM ) technology , which is more convenient and cost-saving in comparison with other high energy beam additive manufacturing technologies . 
During PPAAM , heat input was reduced layer by layer to decrease the heat accumulation . 
The as-fabricated sample exhibited diverse grain morphologies at different locations . 
Columnar dendrites , cellular dendrites , cells and equiaxial dendrites accompanying many Laves phases , MC particles in the interdendritic regions can be observed . 
The largest primary dendritic arm spacing ( ∼41.7 μm ) and Nb-rich phases area fraction ( 3.68 % ) were found in the middle region of the as-fabricated sample . 
After standard heat treatment , Laves phases dissolved into the matrix so that a number of γ′ and γ″ phases were formed . 
Besides , some rod-like δ phases could also be found near grain boundaries . 
The mechanisms of microstructural evolution and phases precipitation were analyzed in detail . 
The test values of the as-fabricated sample demonstrated a slightly higher tensile strength and dramatically outstanding ductility compared with cast Inconel 718 alloy . 
Applying standard heat treatment could remarkably enhance the tensile strength but decrease the ductility and make them comparable with wrought Inconel 718 alloy due to the precipitation of strengthening phases . 
Maraging steel microlattice was printed by SLM , crushed , and simulated using FEM . 
SEM and micro-CT was performed on as-built samples to verify structural integrity . 
Two modeling techniques are presented based on as-built and as-designed geometries . 
FESEM was performed on the crushed lattice for failure analysis . 
Good agreement is found between the experiment and the simulations . 
Additive metal manufacturing techniques , in particular laser-based powder bed fusion methods , are revolutionary in their capabilities to fabricating new classes of lightweight and complex materials called metallic microlattices . 
In this paper , a microlattice structure was designed for energy absorption purposes and further additively manufactured using maraging steel ( Maraging300 ) powder through Laser-powder bed fusion ( L-PBF ) technique . 
In addition , several cylindrical bars and cubes in horizontal and vertical directions were manufactured to perform uniaxial tensile and compression tests on bulk L-PBF Maraging300 . 
The manufactured microlattices were characterized using different electron microscopy techniques including scanning electron microscopy and micro-CT analysis to ensure that the desired structural integrity was achieved . 
In addition , the microlattice was then crushed using a universal mechanical testing machine to evaluate its performance experimentally under quasi-static uniaxial compressive loading conditions . 
Along with the crush , a nonlinear finite element model with predictive capabilities was then developed using commercial package ( LS-DYNA ) for axial crush of the microlattice to compare its expected performance . 
Two finite element models are developed using the as-built geometry from the printed lattice , and the as-designed geometry . 
The effect of model parameters is discussed and very good agreement between the experimental results and the finite element prediction was observed . 
Finally statistical analysis of the model and failure analysis of the crushed lattice is presented . 
Hybrid Metal Extrusion and Bonding Additive Manufacturing ( HYB-AM ) is a new solid-state process for the production of 3D metal structures . 
In HYB-AM , the wire feedstock is continuously processed through an extruder and deposited in a stringer-by-stringer manner to form layers and eventually a near net-shape component . 
In this work , the layer bonding of AA6082 samples produced by this process has been investigated by means of tensile testing , hardness measurements and microscope analyses . 
Furthermore , a novel method for the fabrication of miniature tensile specimens for assessing the bond strength across the layers is presented and applied . 
The test results reveal that the ultimate tensile strength is approaching that of the substrate material of the same alloy , yet with a somewhat lower elongation prior to fracture . 
Microscope analyses show that the bonded interfaces are fully dense ; however , the fracture surfaces reveal regions of kissing-bonds and lack of bonding . 
Still , these preliminary investigations indicate that the HYB-AM process , upon further optimization , has the potential of processing high quality aluminum alloy components . 
Ferritic/martensitic ( FM ) steels are being targeted for use in a range of advanced reactor concepts as cladding and structural components . 
FM steels for nuclear reactor applications have historically been produced using traditional methods ( e.g. 
, casting and forging ) , but recently , additive manufacturing processes have become of interest for making FM-based components . 
Here , the laser-blown-powder additive manufacturing process was used to fabricate an FM steel , HT9 , followed by microstructural and mechanical performance evaluations to determine the viability of future use of additive manufacturing for FM-based component fabrication . 
Results showed that the as-built condition formed a layered structure with alternating layers of δ-ferrite and martensite , which resulted in anisotropic engineering and true-stress , true-strain mechanical performance . 
Post-build normalizing and tempering treatments alerted the prior austenite grain size and precipitate distributions , and drove the mechanical performance to near-isotropic properties that mimic wrought-processed properties . 
A new method to forming bulk metallic glass employed ultrasonic additive manufacturing is proposed . 
The bulk Ni-based metallic glass can be formed layer-by-layer with ultrasonic vibration energy . 
The internal hardness and modulus of the bulk metallic glass are higher with ultrasonic additive manufacturing . 
It is difficult to produce bulk blanks directly from metallic glass , which limits its application . 
Ni-based metallic-glass thin strips that can be manufactured easily were used to manufacture bulk metallic glass additively by ultrasonic bonding . 
The effects of ultrasonic vibration energy on the quality of the additive manufacturing of bulk Ni-based metallic glass were studied . 
The experimental results showed that a fully amorphous structure of bulk Ni-based metallic glass can be obtained with an appropriate ultrasonic vibration energy . 
The thermal properties were almost unchanged , and the hardness and elastic modulus of the Ni-based metallic glass were improved compared with the original material . 
Additive manufacturing of bulk metallic glass by ultrasonic bonding can broaden the application field of metallic glass . 
A key challenge for successful exploitation of additive manufacturing ( AM ) across a broad range of industries is the development of fundamental understanding of the relationships between process control and mechanical performance of manufactured components . 
In particular , laser beam powder bed fusion ( PBF-LB ) is identified as a key process for manufacture of metallic AM components . 
Ti-6Al-4V alloy is an important metal alloy for numerous high-performance applications , including the biomedical and aerospace industries . 
This paper presents initial developments on a model for microstructure prediction in PBF-LB manufacturing of Ti-6Al-4V , primarily focused on solid-state phase transformation and dislocation density evolution . 
The motivation is to quantify microstructure variables which control mechanical behavior , including tensile strength and ductility . 
A finite element ( FE ) based model of the process is adopted for thermal history prediction . 
Phase transformation kinetics for transient non-isothermal conditions are adopted and implemented within a stand-alone code , based on the FE-predicted thermal histories of sample material points . 
The evolution and spatial variations of phase fractions , α lath width and dislocation density are presented , to provide an assessment of the resulting microstructure-sensitivity of mechanical properties . 
Friction stir processing ( FSP ) is combined with additive manufacturing ( AM ) with selective laser melting to locally enhance the material properties of a metallic part . 
A groove inside aluminium 1060 alloy sheet is filled with an aluminium 7075 alloy powder by AM . 
While the overall hardness of the stir zone ( SZ ) increases significantly , the heterogeneous microstructure results in a unique uneven hardness distribution in the SZ . 
Tensile tests confirm the effectiveness of the suggested technique . 
In laser-foil-printing additive manufacturing , 3D metallic glass structures can be built by laser welding of amorphous foils , layer by layer , upon a crystalline metal substrate . 
In this paper , weldability studies for laser welding of Zr52.5Ti5Al10Ni14.6Cu17.9 amorphous foils onto a Ti-6Al-4V ( Ti 6-4 ) or Zr 702 substrate are conducted . 
After laser welding , the weldments are analyzed using X-ray diffractometer , optical microscope , scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy and micro-hardness tester . 
The results show that Zr 702 is a suitable substrate for Zr-based metallic glass structure since crack-free weld joints can be obtained owing to the formation of ductile α-Zr , while Ti 6-4 is not an appropriate substrate since it has high cracking susceptibility due to the formation of a large amount of hard and brittle intermetallics near the foil-substrate interface . 
It was found that the mixing between melted substrate and foil is not uniform but exhibits a distinct “ swirl ” pattern . 
The swirl structure is more pronounced in Ti 6-4 than in Zr 702 substrate which may contribute to its high cracking susceptibility . 
The aforementioned mixing leads to partial crystallization of the first amorphous layer ; however , fully amorphous is achieved in the additional welding layers . 
The deposition process of wire and arc additive manufacturing ( WAAM ) is usually planned based on a bead geometry model ( BGM ) , which represents the relationship between bead geometries ( e.g . 
width , height ) and required deposition parameters . 
However , the actual deposition situation may deviate from the one in which the BGM is built , such as varied heat dissipation conditions , resulting in morphological changes of deposited beads and geometrical errors in the formed parts . 
In this paper , a novel control mechanism for enhancing the fabrication accuracy of WAAM based on fuzzy-logic inference is proposed . 
It considers the geometrical errors measured on already deposited layers and deposition context to adjust deposition parameters of beads in the subsequent layer , forming an interlayer closed-loop control ( ICLC ) mechanism . 
This paper not only presents the theoretical fundamentals of the ICLC mechanism but also reports the technical details about utilizing this mechanism to control the forming height of multi-layer multi-bead ( MLMB ) components . 
A fuzzy-logic inference machine was applied as the core component for calculating speed change of bead deposition based on height error and previously applied change . 
In terms of validation , the effectiveness of the proposed control mechanism and the implemented controller was investigated through both simulative studies and real-life experiments . 
The fabricated cuboid blocks showed good accuracy in height with a maximum error of 0.20 mm . 
The experimental results implied that the proposed ICLC approach facilitates deposition continuity of WAAM , and thus enables process automation for robotic manufacturing . 
A hybrid additive manufacturing technology for fabricating functionally graded materials ( FGMs ) is proposed in this paper . 
The new process represents a combination of two existing additive manufacturing processes , selective laser melting ( SLM ) and cold spraying ( CS ) . 
The targeted experiment of Al and Al + Al2O3 deposited onto SLM Ti6Al4V via CS reveals that the hybrid additive manufacturing process can produce thick , dense and machinable FGMs composed of non-weldable metals without intermetallic phase formation at the multi-materials interface . 
The SLM Ti6Al4V part exhibited fully acicular martensitic microstructure in contrast with α + β microstructure in the Ti6Al4V feedstock , while the grain structure of the CS Al part had no significant change as compared with the Al feedstock . 
Due to the phase transformation of the SLM part and work hardening of the CS part , the overall hardness of the FMGs was higher than that of the feedstock . 
The emerging trend of manufacturing is keenly focused on increasing the productivity . 
Many alternatives to enhance the productivity of a manufacturing industry involves reformation of production cycle , increasing the life of cutting tool , reducing the design complexity , etc . 
However , the increasing nature of size reduction and complexion in design seeks alternate method of manufacturing . 
The additive manufacturing is an emerging methodology used for meeting the needs of growing demand . 
It is a process of manufacturing parts by depositing materials which is contrary to that of conventional . 
This work presents a complete investigational survey on various additive manufacturing techniques , integration of digital pre-processing procedures , and product-based process designing . 
The process of creating models with reduced development and manufacturing time is discussed in an absolute manner . 
Several application-based materials are described in details along with few properties at the end of rapid manufacturing . 
Additive manufacturing ( AM ) processes such as Wire-Arc Additive Manufacturing ( WAAM ) are highly flexible and particularly suited for manufacturing complex geometries in small batch-sizes . 
In the case of large batch-sizes , the low production rate of WAAM is a bottleneck , and therefore forming processes with higher production rates are more suitable . 
However , forming processes such as closed die forging require dedicated tooling and hence lack the flexibility needed to produce product variants . 
The current study proposes to combine additive manufacturing with forging to form hybrid components with high complexity and acceptable production rates . 
However , the main challenge in achieving a combination of these manufacturing technologies is the design of the process chain , ensuring that the final properties meet the specifications of the part . 
In this regard , the process sequence of forming followed by WAAM is investigated . 
The base material EN AW-6082 was formed to a preform by forging , followed by the deposition of different aluminum alloys by WAAM . 
The evolution of mechanical properties such as hardness and microstructure was analyzed . 
Based on the experimental observations , strategies to improve the performance of the hybrid components are presented . 
In order to achieve a polytropic expansion through a reciprocating machine , an extremely compact heat exchanger is designed . 
It is a Mini Channel Heat Exchanger ( MCHE ) , cross-flow configuration , aluminium made . 
So , the additive manufacturing DMLS technique was used to make the exchanger . 
Then a simplified design calculation is used to roughly predict its performance . 
Finally , the experimental test rig and the experimental data are shown . 
The rapid prototyping has been developed from the 1980s to produce models and prototypes until the technologies evolution today . 
Nowadays , these technologies have other names such as 3D printing or additive manufacturing , and so forth , but they all have the same origins from rapid prototyping . 
The design and manufacturing process stood the same until new requirements such as a better integration on production line , a largest series of manufacturing or the reduce weight of products due to heavy costs of machines and materials . 
The ability to produce complex geometries allows proposing of design and manufacturing solutions in the industrial field in order to be ever more effective . 
The additive manufacturing ( AM ) technology develops rapidly with news solutions and markets which sometimes need to demonstrate their reliability . 
The community needs to survey some evolutions such as the new exchange format , the faster 3D printing systems , the advanced numerical simulation or the emergence of new use . 
We propose to review the different AM technologies and the new trends to get a global overview through the engineering and manufacturing process . 
This article describes the engineering and manufacturing cycle with the 3D model management and the most recent technologies from the evolution of additive manufacturing . 
Finally , the use of AM resulted in new trends that are exposed below with the description of some new economic activities . 
The first method to create a three-dimensional object layer by layer using computer-aided design ( CAD ) was rapid prototyping , developed in the 1980s to produce models and prototype parts . 
The main advantage of the Additive Manufacturing ( AM ) is its ability to create almost any possible shape and this capacity is run by the layer-by-layer manufacturing . 
AM technology is most commonly used for modelling , prototyping , tooling through an exclusive machine or 3D printer . 
AM is largely used for manufacturing short-term prototypes but it is also used for small-scale series production and tooling applications ( Rapid Tooling ) . 
This technology was created to help and support the engineers in their conceptualisation . 
Among the major advances that this process presented to product development are the time and cost reduction , human interaction , and consequently the product cycle development . 
Those shapes could indeed be very difficult to manufacture with other processes ( e.g . 
milling , moulding ) . 
The complex geometries or the curved surfaces needed have to be maintained with a support material . 
The feedback has a great influence on the quality or effectiveness of the manufactured model . 
From one technology to another , the manufacture direction , the model orientation and the material behaviour are important to get an accurate model and an efficient production . 
Nowadays , these technologies have other names such as 3D printing , and so forth , but they all have the same origins from rapid prototyping . 
The demand of AM machines is increasingly growing since the 1990s . 
Due to the evolution of rapid prototyping technologies , it has become possible to obtain parts representative of a mass production within a very short time . 
AM perfectly fits into the numerical design and manufacturing chain . 
AM is very complementary with the reverse engineering to reproduce or repair a model . 
Many rapid prototyping technologies have appeared on the market based on the same layers manufacturing approach . 
AM or 3D printing have strongly been developed and currently propose several solutions . 
Use of AM leads to new practices in different domains which push the manufacturer to adapt . 
The evolution of AM technologies also leads to news solutions driven by very strong demand . 
Use and evolution change gradually the product life cycle in order to reducing the manufacturing cost and time while increasing reliability . 
We propose to realise a technologic review of manufacturing processes followed by their illustrative scheme . 
We have chosen to classify the AM by manufacturing technologies to explain them . 
First of all , we will describe the design process before the technologies description while involving some industrial and academic trends . 
The stages involved to the product design and the rapid prototyping show that the cycle development is specific . 
These rapid prototyping processes generally consist of a substance , such as fluids , waxes , powders or laminates , which serve as basis for model construction as well as sophisticated computer-automated equipment to control the processing techniques such as deposition , sintering , lasing , etc . 
There exist two possibilities to start an AM cycle , begin with a virtual model or a physical model . 
The virtual model created by a CAD software can be either a surface or a solid model . 
On the other hand , 3D data from the physical model is not at all straightforward and it requires data acquisition through a method known as a reverse engineering . 
The process begins with a 3D model in CAD software before converting it in STL format file . 
This format is treated by specific software , own to the AM technology , which cuts the piece in slices to get a new file containing the information for each layer . 
The specific software generates the hold to maintain the complex geometries automatically with sometimes the possibility to choose some parameters . 
We can decompose the engineering and manufacturing cycle by Part design in CAD or reverse engineering by 3D scanning . 
Skills optimisation in CAE to adapt the part to the manufacturing technology chosen . 
Conversion of part geometry in exchange format ( STL ) . 
Exchange file implementation into the specific software of the AM machine . 
Configuration and orientation of the set ( parts and supports ) . 
Slicing of the part by the specific software . 
Computation and layers manufacturing . 
Post-processing . 
This new file is often proprietary of the machine manufacturer . 
Rapid manufacturing machine implement the last file to realise the layer-by-layer manufacturing . 
The operator has to prepare the machine with its raw material ( powder , resin cartridge ( s ) , polymer spool ( s ) , etc ) and the manufacturing source ( laser , printing head ( s ) , binder cartridge ( s ) , etc ) . 
For the manufacturing , the support material maintains the external and internal surfaces to keep a steady geometry with a structure using scaffolding . 
In most cases , the support material is cleaned during the finishing ( ex . 
MJM Technology ) or recycled during the post-processing ( e.g . 
SLS , SLM , CJD/3DP Technologies ) . 
This step depends on the complex geometry fabricated and if there is need an additional hold resulting in a loss of material . 
Some technologies allow extracting of the main material , thanks to holes inside closed geometry . 
The post-processing step sometimes includes a hardening or infiltration of the main material to obtain the final piece . 
Several manufacturing constraints require a feedback while involving rules to get a precisely and compliant model . 
Rapid prototyping techniques are classified in two categories : subtractive , and additive . 
Subtractive technologies work by removing raw material out of a workpiece until the desired shape is obtained . 
They include cutting ( laser-cutting or water-jet cutting ) and machining ( lathing and milling ) . 
Conversely , the additive technologies work by adding of the raw material . 
Modelling is a very important step in AM because it shapes the product but it also must take in account some knowledge since the experiments and equipment are costly . 
Various potential empirical modelling techniques coexist so that the choice of an appropriate modelling technique for a given AM process can be made . 
To develop models based on only given data , several well-known statistical methods such as regression analysis or response surface methodology can be applied . 
The formulation of the physics-based models requires in-depth understanding of the process and is not an easy task in presence of partial information about the process . 
Few research studies have been conducted to improve the prediction ability of the GP ( Genetic Programming ) and the MGGP ( Multi-Gene Genetic Programming ) models by hybridising them with the other potential computational intelligence methods such as artificial neural network ( ANN ) , fuzzy logic , M5 ’ regression trees and support vector regression . 
MGGP is the most popular variant of GP used recently . 
Those approaches provide a model in the form of a mathematical equation reflecting the relationship between the mechanical behaviours and the given input parameters . 
The performance of ANN is found to be better than those of GP and regression , showing the effectiveness of ANN in predicting the performance characteristics of prototype . 
The STL ( STereoLithography or Standard Tessellation Language ) file format was created by 3D Systems in 1987 and became a standard for the additive manufacturing . 
The STL file creation process mainly converts the continuous geometry in the CAD file into a header , small triangles or coordinates triplet list of x , y and z coordinates and the normal vector to the triangles . 
Each facet is uniquely identified by a normal vector and three vertices . 
The facets define the surfaces of a 3D object . 
Each facet is part of the boundary between the interior and the exterior of the object and each triangle facet must share two vertices with each of its adjacent triangles . 
The surface creation can generate errors because of holes or intersecting triangles and it is sometimes necessary to repair the STL model . 
The slicing process also introduces inaccuracy to the file because here the algorithm replaces the continuous contour with discrete stair steps . 
Edges are added after the slicing process . 
Today , the computation data and the mesh generation is no longer an obstacle to process models . 
The computer power used is sufficient to get a refined STL file with many triangles . 
More the 3D model refined is high , the clearer the details are and the bigger the file size is . 
According to the 2014 Wohlers Report , consumers of 3D printers are classified as those that cost less than $ 5000 . 
The Cornell University and the University of Bath have designed the first open-source 3D printers which are widely recognised in the area : Fab @ home and RepRap . 
The entered range 3D printers are predominantly based on Fused Deposition Modeling ( FDM ) technology , but more recently machines derived from stereolithography have entered the market due to expiring patents . 
It is typically to demonstrate that low-cost machines have a low performance . 
For example , the FDM consumer technology suffers from anisotropic mechanical properties as well as a limited selection of thermoplastic materials . 
A FDM professional printer costs between $ 10,000 and $ 300,000 . 
Typical laser and electron beam-based systems can cost anywhere between $ 500,000 and $ 1 M. While these machines are typically high in performance , they come at a high cost . 
The commercial 3D printers that use more advanced techniques to print objects are usually equipped with proprietary software which slice the 3D model and command the machine . 
Companies that sell professional 3D printers include 3D Systems , Stratasys , Solido LTD , Voxeljet and ExOne . 
Both Hewlett Packard and Xerox ‘ are investing in 3D printing research and technology development . 
Each AM technologies have manufacturing constraints linked by printing technology , used material and expected functions ( aesthetic , mechanical , use , etc ) . 
Areas of interest which have used 3D printing to create objects include aeronautics , architecture , automotive industries , art , dentistry , fashion , food , jewellery , medicine , pharmaceuticals , robotics and toys . 
Automotive manufacturers exploited the technology because of the ability to help new products get quickly to the market and in a predictable manner . 
Aerospace companies are interested in these technologies because of the ability to realise highly complex and high-performance products . 
Integrating mechanical functionality , eliminating assembly features and making it possible to create internal functionality ( like cooling channels ) , internal honeycomb style structures , new topological optimisation structure etc . 
combine to create lightweight structures . 
Medical industries are particularly interested in AM technology because of the ease in which 3D medical imaging data can be converted into solid objects . 
Thus , each AM technology have advantages and disadvantages for own applications and we propose to review them . 
Authors have chosen to classify the technologies according to hardening system or melting system which are characterised by a laser , a flashing source , an extrusion or a jetting . 
SLA – Stereolithography is the first of the technologies developed originally and simultaneously in France and in the USA to tackle rapid prototyping bottlenecks , as well as faster and better design needs ( CAD induced ) . 
In 1986 , 3D Systems was founded by Chuck Hull to commercialise this process . 
Photolithographic systems build shapes using light to selectively solidify photosensitive resins . 
The laser lithography approach is currently one of the most used AM technologies . 
Models are defined by scanning a laser beam over a photopolymer surface . 
For a few years , researchers have developed techniques to apply SLA to directly make ceramics . 
Ceramic powder ( silica and alumina ) is dispersed in a fluid UV curable monomer to prepare a ceramic–UV curable monomer suspension . 
The building process is the same as conventional SLA and the monomer solution is cured forming a ceramic–polymer composite layer . 
The prototypes have higher stiffness than a standard workpiece and their temperature resistance over 200 °C . 
A higher resolution machine has been developed and called microstereolithography and it can print a layer with thickness of less than 10 μm . 
The microstereolithography shares the same principle with its macro scale counterpart , but in different dimensions . 
In microstereolithography , an UV laser beam is focused to 1–2 μm to solidify a thin layer of 1–10 μm in thickness . 
Submicron resolution of the x–y–z translation stages and the fine UV beam spot enable precise fabrication of real 3D complex microstructures . 
SLM – Selective Laser Melting – the system starts by applying a thin layer of the powder material spread by a roller on the building platform . 
A powerful laser beam then fuses the powder at exactly the points defined by the computer-generated component design data . 
The platform is then lowered and another layer of powder is applied . 
Once again the material is fused so as to bond with the layer below at the predefined points . 
During the process , successive layers of metal powder are fully melted and consolidated on top of each other . 
Today , the 3D printer manufacturers propose machines with powerful double or multi laser technology with layers from 75 to 150 μm in thickness . 
The material types that can be processed include steel , stainless steel , cobalt chrome , titanium and aluminium . 
Electron Beam Melting is a powder process which distinguishes by its superior accuracy and high-power electron beam ( up to 3000 W while maintaining a scan speed ) that generates the energy needed for high melting capacity and high productivity . 
Selective Laser Sintering ( SLS ) – use a high-power laser to fuse small particles ( polyamide , steel , titanium , alloys , ceramic powders , etc ) . 
As the SLM , the powder bed is lowered by one layer thickness , a new layer of powder is applied on top , and the process is repeated until the model is completed . 
But what sets sintering apart from melting is that the sintering processes do not fully melt the powder , but heat it to the point that the powder can fuse together on a molecular level . 
The latest SLS machines offer laser powers from 30 W to 200 W in a CO² chamber controlled ( in range ProX and sPro ) . 
The porosity of the material can be controlled . 
This porosity requests a post-treatment by infiltration to harden the final model like the bronze use to the steel . 
The SLS prototypes have a greater dimensional accuracy than the PolyJet and 3DP models . 
Direct Metal Laser Sintering ( DMLS ) – is similar to SLS with some differences . 
The technology is a powder bed fusion process by melting the metal powder locally using the focused laser beam . 
A product is manufactured layer by layer along the Z axis and the powder is deposited via a scraper moving in the XY plane . 
The DMLS process from EOS© is well established for the net shape fabrication of prototype and short series tooling for plastic injection moulding . 
The first generation of EOS machine includes a 200-W laser source when the second generation ( EOSINT M280 ) was launched with a 400-W fibre laser . 
The trend shows an increase in laser power and also an increase in work chamber . 
DMLS often refers to the process that is applied to metal alloys for the manufacturing direct parts in the industry including aerospace , dental , medical and other industry that have small to medium size , highly complex parts and the tooling industry to make direct tooling inserts . 
Today , recent developments in the powders coupled with the durability of the materials are extending its reach to the direct manufacturing of functional prototypes for powder metallurgical and cast components . 
Support structures are required for most geometry because the powder alone is not sufficient to hold in place the liquid phase created when the laser is scanning the powder . 
The rapid manufacturing of parts by the DMLS process requires the use of a powder , which is composed of two types of particles . 
One type has a low melting point , and the other a high melting point . 
The high-melting point particles generate a solid matrix , while the particles with the low melting point bind the matrix after being melted by the laser energy input . 
In order to reduce lead time and increase in build speed , a new technology has emerged derivative from SLA . 
On the same principle proposed by Pomerantz a photomask system ( masking technology ) to produce 3D models , the DLP – Digital Light Processing , also known as FTI – Film Transfer Imaging , use the UV photopolymerised materials . 
A film is coated in resin which is then cured by a UV flash of light from a projector for each slice of product . 
Unlike the 3D laser printer , the DLP projector projects the entire layer , and not only of lines or points . 
This method allows building much quicker than other methods of rapid prototyping by substituting scanning time of a laser . 
With SLA , the part descends downward into the resin , whereas it is pulled upward out of the resin in a DLP printer . 
SLA process is gentler on the forming implant than the DLP process because , in DLP , the part must attach much more firmly to the build platform to prevent damage when newly formed layers are peeled from the basement plate after each exposure . 
The building platform can be angled upward and the light source down in some masking machines ( e.g . 
Phidias technologies with Prodways 3D printer ) . 
The DLP technology is known for its high resolution , typically able to reach a layer thickness of down to 30 μm . 
A new innovation in mask-image-projection based on the stereolithography process has been developed to produce objects with digital materials . 
The proposed approach is based on projecting mask images with a new two-channel system design which reduces the separation force between a cured layer and the resin vat . 
The fabrication results demonstrate that the developed dual-material process can successfully produce 3D objects with spatial control over placement of both material and structure . 
Close to DLP principle , the Continuous Liquid Interface Production ( CLIP ) production is a new type of AM that uses photopolymerisation working in continuous , thanks to a projector and the ability to control oxygen levels throughout an oxygen-permeable membrane . 
This latter process is 30 times faster than the SLS or the MJM . 
Extrusion technologies- Fused Deposition Modeling ( FDM ) is a layer AM process that uses a thermoplastic filament by fused depositing . 
FDM is trademarked by Stratasys Inc in the late 1980s and the equivalent term is Fused Filament Fabrication ( FFF ) . 
The filament is extruded through a nozzle to print one cross section of an object , then moving up vertically to repeat the process for a new layer . 
The most used materials in FDM are ABS , PLA and PC ( Polycarbonate ) but you can find out new blends containing wood and stone as well as filaments with rubbery characteristics . 
Compared to ABS , PLA responds differently to moisture , to ageing UV with a discoloration and to withdrawal of material . 
To predict the mechanical behaviour of FDM parts , it is critical to understand the material properties of the raw FDM process material , and the effect that FDM build parameters have on anisotropic material properties . 
The support material is often made of another material and is detachable or soluble from the actual part at the end of the manufacturing process ( except for the low-cost solutions , which use the same raw material ) . 
The disadvantages are that the resolution on the z axis is low compared to other AM process ( 0.25 mm ) , so if a smooth surface is needed a finishing process is required and it is a slow process sometimes taking days to build large complex parts . 
FDM technology is the most popular of desktop 3D printers and the less expensive professional printers . 
Directed Energy Deposition ( DED ) – covers a range of terminology : Laser Engineered Net Shaping ( LENS ) , directed light fabrication ( IFF – Ion Fusion Formation ) , Direct Metal Deposition ( DMD ) , 3D laser cladding . 
It is a more complex printing process commonly used to repair or add additional material to existing components . 
LENS is used to melt the surface of the target point while a stream of powdered metal is delivered onto the small targeted point . 
IFF melts a metal wire or powder with a plasma welding torch to form an object . 
This is a near-net-shape manufacturing process that uses a very hot ionised gas to deposit a metal in small amounts . 
DMD melts metal wire by electron beam as feedstock used to form an object within a vacuum chamber . 
The objects created in DED can be larger , even up to several feet long . 
Dough Deposition Modeling ( DDM ) – groups the marginal processes which file different doughs ( Figure 6 ) . 
Some technologies based on FDM printers use a syringe to deposit a dough material like silicone , food dough , chocolate , etc . 
A syringe-based extrusion tool which uses a linear stepper motor to control the syringe plunger position . 
The medical research uses the deposition of biomaterial and cells to realise a tissue structure . 
It presents a novel method for the deposition of biopolymers in high-resolution structures , using a pressure-activated microsyringe . 
Other works show applications to extrude a bio-based material to reconstitute a model and preserve the ecological environment . 
Experimentation uses a piston and 3D printer head adapted on a CNC machine to deposit a pulpwood based on wood flour to create a reconstituted wood product . 
Jet technologies - MJM – Multi Jet Modeling – deposits droplets of photopolymer materials with multi jets on a building platform in ultra-thin layers until the part is completed . 
Two different photopolymer materials are used for building , one for the actual model and another gel like material for supporting . 
The photopolymer layers are cured by UV lamps and a gel-like polymer supports the complexity of geometry in wrapping it . 
The soluble gel-like ( support material ) is then removed by a water jet . 
The PolyJet technique reproduced details more accurately with a very good surface finish and smoothness . 
The accuracy of a PolyJet machine can reach thickness from 50 to 25 μm , besides the parts have a higher resolution . 
Also known as Thermojet , some systems can produce wax models in jetting tiny droplets of melted liquid material which cool and harden on impact to form the solid object . 
3DP – three-dimensional printing , also known as CJP – Colour Jet Printing , combines powders and binders . 
3DP has been developed by the MIT . 
Each layer is created by spreading a thin powder layer with a roller and the powder is selectively linked by inkjet printing of a binder . 
The build tray goes down to create the next layer . 
This process has been used to fabricate numerous metal , ceramic , silica and polymeric components of any geometry for a wide array of applications . 
Other powders have been tested to realise green products in wood . 
3DP can print in multicolour directly into the part during the build process from a colour cartridge . 
The final model is extracted from the powder bed to realise infiltration with liquid glue . 
The infiltrate improves the colour definition and the mechanical behaviours . 
3DP can provide architects a useful tool to quickly create a realistic model . 
Prometal is a 3D printing process to build rapid tools and dies . 
This is a powder-based process in which stainless steel is used . 
The printing process occurs when a liquid binder is spurt out in jets to steel powder . 
A final treatment is required to solidify the part like sintering , infiltration and finishing processes . 
Liquid Metal Jetting ( LMJ ) involves the jetting of molten metal in a process similar to inkjet printing , whereby individual molten droplets are ejected and connected to each other . 
This process is not commercially available yet . 
LOM – Laminated Objet Manufacturing – is a rapid prototyping process where a part is sequentially built from layers of paper . 
The process consists of the thermal adhesive bonding and laser patterning of uniformly-thick paper layers . 
The system includes an x-y plotter device positioned above a work table vertically movable . 
The x-y plotter device includes a forming tool to create a layer from a sheet of material positioned on the work table . 
The layers are bonded to each other with heat-sensitive adhesives provided on one side thereof . 
A bonding tool or fuser is mounted to translate across the work table and apply a lamination force and heat to each of the layers . 
The layers are superimposed to give the final object and the layer resolution is defined by the thickness of the paper sheet . 
3D printers can print in full colours ( Mcor Technologies ) . 
Stratoconception is a rapid prototyping process with layers of sheets . 
It consists in the decomposition of a model by calculating a set of elementary layers called ‘ strata ’ and by placing reinforcing pieces and inserts in strata . 
The elementary layer are displayed and manufactured by rapid milling or laser-cutting . 
The strata are assembled with inserts to rebuild the final object . 
This process is useful thanks to milling of a low-cost sheet in raw material ( wood , MDF , PVC , aluminium , etc ) . 
When you find out the AM technologies and you can use some of them , experts know that several manufacturing constraints and mechanical behaviours bring complications . 
For example , the powder technology leads to extract the final product outside of a power bed before cleaning it and often to applying a post-treatment . 
Moreover , the manufacturing orientation of the model influences the quality of geometry because of material gradient and the manufacturing direction . 
The part orientation can deeply modify the planarity , the circularity and the surface accuracy . 
You have the same constraints with other technologies as the 3DP or DED . 
The internal structure of product due to the material orientation , the manufacturing technology and its manufacturing by layers generates use constraints which need to be integrated . 
We can quote in a non-exhaustive list the anisotropy for the part made by FDM , the crack propagation for powdered parts and the ageing UV for the models in photopolymers . 
You can find out the accuracy of some AM machines from manufacturer sources on the Table 1 . 
From a 3D printer to another , designer does not answer to the same need and accuracy is often decisive to get a reliable product or a functional mechanism . 
Furthermore , the post-treatment , post-machining or post-finishing are often required to get a finished product . 
The recycling and the raw material cost have to be taken into account too . 
To sum up , a set of stages are to define in upstream to assess the AM technology implications . 
The incrementation of experience greatly improves the engineering and manufacturing process . 
The expiring patents open the market for others manufacturers proposing of new machines . 
Since February 2014 , a major patent related to SLS expired ( Apparatus for producing parts by selective sintering n.d. ) . 
New technologies resulting from expiring patents appear with the solutions proposed by the companies DWS Systems ( Italy ) or Formlabs ( USA ) . 
3D printing applied to medical has appeared for some years through different applications . 
The organ transplantation sector has difficulties and the organ printing by jet based on 3d tissue engineering offers a possible solution . 
Some research define organ printing as a rapid prototyping computer-aided 3D printing technology based on using layer-by-layer deposition of cell and/or cell aggregates into a 3D gel with sequential maturation of the printed construct into perfused and vascularised living tissue or organ . 
The success of an implantation depends on compatible materials . 
We can find a variety of biomaterials such as curable synthetic polymers , synthetic gels and naturally derived hydrogels . 
Prosthetic is the first biomedical area which has used the 3D printing and it presents several successes . 
We can quote a patient ’ s skull anatomy reproduced via 3D printing for pre-surgical use in manual implant design and production and the enhancement of the fixation stability of the custom made total hip prostheses and restore the original biomechanical characteristics of the joint . 
Several applications combine some degradable or allogeneic scaffolding with cellular bioprinting to create customised biologic prosthetics that have the great potential to serve as transplantable replacement tissue . 
New articles showed that the medical 3D Printing market might reach 983.2 million $ by the year 2020 . 
Projects for home construction through 3D printing are emerging such as the Shanghai WinSun Decoration Engineering Company . 
This company can print the basic components separately before assembling them on site . 
These concrete houses are built in one day by 3D printing and their construction costs about 3800 $ . 
The 3D printer developed by the Chinese group is much larger than a conventional system and uses the same DDM technology . 
The building industry introduced a vocabulary such as rapid construction or rapid building . 
The use of the STL format limits the exchange of trades data . 
If the STL format allows exporting from a surfacing model towards the specific software , the designer needs to insert rules in upstream work in CAD . 
The emergence of more enriched new exchange format appears such as the Additive Manufacturing file Format ( AMF ) with important parameters ( < material > , < composite > , < metadata > , etc . ) 
or the STL 2.0 . 
Alternative file format exports are also required to support depiction of complex organic geometry , whilst allowing multiple-material and mono/multicolour capabilities ; the development of STL 2.0 or Additive Manufacturing file Format ( AMF ) is promising , particularly for the composition of complex geometries and multiple-material . 
The article shows that we need to transfer more trades data to the additive manufacturing machine through an enriched exchange format . 
The standard ISO/ASTM 52915:2013 Standard specification for additive manufacturing file format ( AMF ) Version 1.15 describes a framework for an interchange format to address the current and future needs of additive manufacturing technology . 
The manufacturing units and the small size of AM build tray complicate the production line . 
Industrials seek to reduce the lead time and increase in build speed but a lot of additive manufacturing technologies are not adapted . 
The interoperability is little studied by 3D printer manufacturers . 
Reflecting the strategy of some companies like ExOne or Voxeljet , the professional 3D printers can be combined to the production line and offer the largest printers on the world market for 3D printing of sand and metal materials . 
Announced as a new industrial revolution , the additive manufacturing technologies will make the difference when it will be interoperable with the set of manufacturing process . 
Development orientations show that the new 3D printers will be more integrated inside the production line with the automation and the connectivity with the digital chain . 
A recent example is the emergence of hybrid system combining the 3D printing by laser deposition of metals ( DMD ) and the CNC machining through the LASERTEC AdditiveManufacturing6 solution proposed by DMG MORI© which accelerates the realisation of the finished product . 
In order to reduce the time and cost of moulds fabrication , additive manufacturing is used to develop and manufacture systems of rapid tooling . 
Powder-based sintering processes are now able to produce metal moulds that can withstand a few thousand cycles of injection moulding . 
AM technologies propose to manufacture of sand moulds for the casting . 
A method to produce a lost mould for casting is used with the thermojet technology by wax . 
We saw that some powder technologies could realise sand moulds for casting ( Voxeljet , ExOne ) . 
Other approaches ally the additive manufacturing technology and the topological optimisation to realise a rapid tooling and to use less material while keeping its properties . 
The layers manufacturing is able to improve a product or a tooling by inserting new methods as cooling channels or sensors . 
For example , an injection mould manufactured by a Stratoconception and after assembly of strata , cooling channels are provided in the various inter-stratum planes for allowing a fluid to pass through the part . 
You must perceive that this type of method can improve the behaviour of a moulded part by adjusting the location of the cooling channels to a specific geometry . 
Another challenge is to reduce weight and decrease the material used while keeping the product functions ( mechanical , use… ) . 
Moreover , the main and support material can be expensive in the AM technology . 
Topology optimisation is a mathematical approach that optimises material layout within a given design space , for a given set of loads and boundary conditions so that the resulting layout meets a prescribed set of performance targets . 
Using topology optimization , engineers can find the best concept design that meets the design requirements . 
Any complex geometry is feasible in additive manufacturing , the topological optimisation implementation of a model leads to a new internal structure while maintaining conditions ( mechanical , design shape , functions , etc ) . 
Topologically , optimised parts have been created with internal geometry , using a narrow-waited structure that avoids the need for building supports . 
Additive manufacturing technology standards are intended to endorse the knowledge of the industry , help stimulate research and encourage the implementation of technology . 
The standards define terminology , measure the performance of different production processes , ensure the quality of the end products , and specify procedures for the calibration of additive manufacturing machines . 
Several major standards were created very recently by the International Organisation for Standardisation ( ISO ) ; we can mention the main ones : ISO 17296-2:2015 : Overview of process categories and feedstock . 
It describes the process fundamentals of AM with the existing processes and the different types of materials used . 
ISO 17296-3:2014 : Main characteristics and corresponding test methods : It covers the principal requirements applied to testing with the main quality characteristics of parts , the appropriate test procedures , and the recommendations . 
ISO/ASTM DIS 2019 : Standard Practice – Guide for Design for AM : It is being developed since 2015 and will bring together good practices in design for getting a reliable product . 
You can also find other standards specifying the terminology in AM or the requirements for purchased AM parts . 
In recent decades additive manufacturing has evolved from a prototyping to a production technology . 
It is used to produce end-use-parts for medical , aerospace , automotive and other industrial applications from small series up to 100,000 of commercially successful products . 
Metal additive manufacturing processes are relatively slow , require complex preparation and post-processing treatment while using expensive machinery , resulting in high production costs per product . 
Design for Additive Manufacturing aims at optimizing the product design to deal with the complexity of the production processes , while also defining decisive benefits of the AM based product in the usage stages of its life cycle . 
Recent investigations have shown that the lack of knowledge on DfAM tools and techniques are seen as one of the barriers for the further implementation of AM . 
This paper presents a framework for DfAM methods and tools , subdivided into three distinct stages of product development : AM process selection , product redesign for functionality enhancement , and product optimization for the AM process chosen . 
It will illustrate the applicability of the design framework using examples from both research and industry . 
Additive manufacturing was first developed in the late 1980 with increasing quality and market penetration ever since . 
Starting as prototyping technology it has developed into a technology that allows for mass production of end use parts . 
In 2018 BMW has reported on 3D printing of its one millionth component in series production . 
Major AM markets that include aerospace , automotive , consumer products , medical , and general industries report simular success stories . 
According to a study by Deloitte AM is implemented within industry to increase the perceived value in any of three area 's : profit , risk and time . 
Next to that the tactical path along which these industries have incorporated AM implementation can be characterized by product and/or supply chain change . 
Four different paths have been identified : Path 1 describes companies that do not seek radical modification of their products and supply chain , but look at AM to improve their value proposition to the customer . 
Typical examples of the use of AM for path 1 are printed prototypes and tools and fixtures . 
Path 2 looks at AM as a means to define new business cases in which the production of end user products can be realized beneficially . 
Examples include for example the production of spare parts and production on problematic production locations like space , war zones and the oil & gas industry . 
Path 3 describes strategies being enabled by AM based new product performance . 
Examples are the fuel nozzle by GE , embedded electronics and lightweight structures . 
Path 4 describes companies that base their new business models on changes in both the supply chains and the products . 
An example for this path is the 3D scanning and printing of custom shoes in retail stores . 
All tactical development paths described above deal with product design within an AM-based supply chain . 
It is required both for the realization of AM-based enhanced product performance as well as when printing more standard product designs ; these designs also have to be optimized for specific AM process opportunities and constraints so they are produced reliably , on time and cost efficiently . 
Design for Additive Manufacturing describes methodologies used to optimize the product design with the goal of improving performance in all lifecycle stages . 
The lack of knowledge on DfAM has been identified as one of the barriers that holds back further adoption of AM in industry . 
This can be attributed to the attention given to AM as a production technology , which only blossomed over the last decade . 
Attention to design for AM trailed behind and only grew in importance when interest in commercial production of end user goods increased . 
The CIRP community has published papers related to AM processes , AM materials , specific AM application areas and AM geometrical aspects . 
The CIRP keynote paper by Thompson focused on DfAM and disclosed the width and complexity of the DfAM theme , and addressed many of the themes that should be considered as part of product development for AM . 
These topics ranged from design strategies and artefact design up to economic and strategic considerations on the implementation of AM within industrial product development processes . 
The paper focussed on design considerations that should be addressed when deciding on the transition from classical production processes to additive manufacturing . 
This keynote paper focuses on the state of the art on methods and tools related to the design of geometry or functional AM artefacts within an industrial setting . 
A general introduction to AM processes and process steps will be presented 2 . 
Section 3 will present a framework for the selection and application of DfAM methods and tools . 
In Sections 4the DfAM framework will be discussed in more detail ; lightweighting , internal topology , surface topolgy , material complexity and part integration . 
When required , methods and examples of application will focus on AM based production of metal parts in an industrial setting . 
The applicability of the design framework is however not limited to the examples given but can , at a generic level , be apllied to the majority of the known AM processes . 
2 Additive manufacturing AM is defined by the ISO/ASTM joint standard 52900:2018 as the process of joining materials to make parts from 3D model data , usually layer upon layer , as opposed to subtractive manufacturing and formative manufacturing methodologies . 
Note that this definition is very general and can be applied to a wide range of technologies . 
Hybrid technologies that for example use additive plus subtractive processes within a single machine may therefore not be considered as AM machines in the strict definition of the term . 
For the near future it is foreseen that fully automated manufacturing lines , combining AM in tight and repetitive sequences alongside other fully automated production and handling processes , will become the standard for the modern factory . 
2.1 AM processes According to ISO/ASTM there are currently seven AM process categories that result in a 3D CAD model being formed into a solid , integrated part : Binder jetting : droplet printing of a liquid used to bind powder particles together ; Directed energy deposition : material is simultaneously fed into a moving focused energy region ; Material extrusion : material is fed through a nozzle in a liquid state after which solidifies ; Material jetting : material is jetted in liquid droplet form after which it solidifies ; Powder bed fusion : powder material is selectively heated so that the particles partially or fully melt to form a solid matrix ; Sheet lamination : sheets of material are bonded together either before or after the part outline is separated from the sheets ; Vat photopolymerisation : a platform is dropped through or raised above a vat of liquid resin where light is used to selectively solidify it . 
Most of these categories have so far resulted mainly in machines that are designed for one-off prototypes or for production that heavily employs manual work . 
Whilst the AM technology itself is largely automated , the design process , machine setup and finishing stages may require a significant amount of knowledge and skills to perform . 
All the above processes were initially developed to create parts from different polymeric materials , with the exception of sheet lamination . 
Some of these technologies have now been developed to a level where they have been incorporated into large batch production . 
Some of these batches can be considered to be part of a continuous production line . 
The most well-known of these would be AM machines used in production of teeth aligners and hearing aids . 
These examples show that when the additional complexity of form and/or the individual part cost allows it , AM can be used for final part production of parts . 
The impact of AM on process chain towards final production is however most heavily felt when producing metal parts . 
All of the above process categories have a means in which to arrive at a metal part . 
The first approach is by mixing metal particles with the material joining mechanism . 
For example , metal particles can be added to photopolymers in vat photopolymerisation or mixed with polymer powder in powder bed fusion or with filament in material extrusion . 
In general this will end in a blended part that exhibits some of the properties of the metal like improved surface hardness or heat deflection . 
The second approach is where the parts above are used in a secondary furnace cycle to burn off the polymer and cause the metal particles to sinter together . 
This process therefore requires an additional programmable furnace to achieve this effect . 
In addition to the process categories mentioned in the previous paragraph , binder jetting is also widely used in this manner . 
It should be noted in particular that part shrinkage will occur using this approach . 
This shrinkage can be minimised if an infiltrant is used to fill in voids prior to densification . 
For example 420 stainless steel parts can be infiltrated with bronze at 1100 . 
Many technologies have been refined to a level where geometric tolerances are highly predictable and achieving up to 97 % final density values . 
Conventional polymer AM materials can often be used in casting processes to achieve metal parts . 
Some of the original processes were developed around waxes as a means to integrate with conventional investment casting . 
It was found later that other , stronger polymers could be used in this way provided the casting shells were strengthened and the burnout conditions were modified . 
Four of the above process categories can directly produce metal parts ; powder bed fusion , directed energy deposition , material jetting , and sheet lamination . 
It is interesting to note that sheet lamination is largely a hybrid process . 
In sheet lamination there can be a large amount of material , often much more than is used for the part itself , that is separated from the part in a subtractive manner during the AM process . 
These sheets can be metal and bonded together using ultrasonic bonding . 
This is a low temperature welding process for joining dissimular metals and can for example allow embedding of electronics in the structure without damaging it . 
It is a niche AM route towards metal parts . 
By far the most widely used AM approach for metal parts is powder bed fusion . 
This is largely because of the basic simplicity of the process combined with the fact that a range metals is readily available and suitable for mainstream applications . 
A beam of energy is used to selectively melt the powders to form the solid part . 
Electron beam melting is available but most systems use laser energy , normally in a sealed chamber , in an inert gas environment or a vacuum . 
This sealed chamber may be at an elevated temperature but still considerably below the melting point of the metal . 
Since this means very large thermal gradients , it is normal to connect the parts to a solid substrate in a similar way to processes that require support structures . 
These supports have a different purpose in that they anchor the part to prevent internal stress warpage during build . 
Directed energy deposition is a process that almost entirely focuses on metal parts . 
A high energy source is used to melt metals that are delivered in either powder or wire form . 
The energy focal point is also where the material is delivered and so there is a periodic melting followed by rapid solidification . 
Similar issues to powder bed fusion exist regarding residual stresses with the additional complexity of a significantly varying thermal environment . 
Since there is no surrounding powder to help stabilise the heat transfer , the directed energy deposition process will have differing cooling profiles dependent on the mass of surrounding material at the energy delivery point . 
Material jetting for the production of metal parts is hampered by the high temperatures needed to get the metals in the proper liquid state . 
As a result this technology , when used to directly fabricate metal parts , is still in the development stage . 
2.2 AM process steps The process of creating an additively manufactured product can be subdevided into seven steps . 
1 Model design . 
3D CAD software can be used to create a solid or surface model or scan data is used to create the 3D geometry ; 2 STL file creation . 
The 3D model is converted into a file format that is understood by AM machines . 
The STL file format is widely used and approximates the 3D model by a surface that is constructed using triangles . 
Other file formats exist that are better suited to advanced AM features like multi material parts ; 3 Build preperation . 
The STL file is transferred to the build preparation software , where the location and orientation of the part in the build envelope are defined . 
The software slices the geometry into individual layers . 
For each layer the geometric data of that layer , in combination with the machine parameters , like laser power , layer thickness and scan patterns , is translated into build instructions for the AM machine ; 4 The build process . 
After the build process the part is removed from the build plate/envelope and excess material is removed . 
Additional post-processing steps might be needed to improve the functional characteristics of the part . 
6 Quality and inspection . 
Often quality and inspection methods are applied that are based on other production technologies like casting and forging . 
But the complexity of the geometry can induce unique inspection problems like inaccesable surfaces or the absence of measuring datum planes ; 7 Application . 
For most industrial parts produced by additive manufacturing the expected benefits in the use phase are the reason for designing parts to be created by additive manufacturing . 
2.3 AM design stages As mentioned in Thompson , the AM design process has to take into account a lot of aspects related to several key performance indicators . 
Globally , as defined in the standard ISO/ASTM 52910:2018 the AM design steps can be structured into three global stages . 
The first stage relates to go/no-go evaluations concerning the part , tool or product to be considered . 
Manufacturability issues will have to be checked at this stage even before defining any geometry . 
Before that , however , crucial decisions must be made with respect to functional decomposition and functional integration . 
One later decision will be to define the complete manufacturing for each feature as well as the scheduling of the individual manufacturing operations , with possible use of different manufacturing technologies . 
The material and its characteristics will also have to be defined for each voxel of the part . 
The definition of the material characteristics must be fixed as well as the definition of transitions between different materials in different regions of the objects . 
These possibilities are limited to AM technologies that allow assembly of different materials or grading material characteristics in a given part . 
The third stage corresponds to the final check and optimization of process characteristics with respect to the best possible properties of the manufactured objects . 
For example , the number of parts produced is dependent on the choice of orientation of the part and consequently on the support structures that are minimized with respect to an optimum part geometry . 
These three global design stages serve to minimize the technical and economic risks before going to manufacturing . 
Design does not therefore just rely on a simple set of design guidelines . 
A global and systemic vision of the complete value chain has to be considered with respect to global indicators like in particular lead time , cost and quality , in order to evaluate feasibility , suitability and stability of AM-based value chain performances . 
3 A DfAM framework Design for manufacturing and assembly has been around for many years and deals with the design of products while focussing on both the manufacturing and assembly process . 
The goal of DfMA is to include manufacturing and assembly knowledge early in the design proces to increase chances of success and shorten the development cycle . 
Many variants exist , focussed for example on specific production technologies like injection molding or casting . 
DfAM focusses on AM processes but differs from other DfX processes . 
It deals with many different AM process variants and needs to take the whole process chain into account to be successful while research has shown that the number of interacting aspects that define successful production is large . 
Finally , AM is a new group of processes that provides other opportunities and constraints to traditional forming and subtractive processes which implies non-traditional approaches to product design are required . 
Many papers exist on individual aspects of the design process while for a succesful design process all relevant aspects should be taken into account . 
The framework defines a structured method to link design challenges to specific design goals and focusses on the 3 stages presented 2.3 . 
Examples used will focus on AM-based manufacturing of metal products although the framework is generic in nature and can also be applied for other material/process combinations . 
3.1 AM suitability Additive manufacturing is a relatively new group of production processes , of which integration in industry is just starting to gain momentum . 
This momentum might be attributed to the claims of a future where AM will realize low cost efficient production of any shape in any material . 
Current industrial additive manufacturing practice shows that this bright future is yet to be . 
Timely identification of the match between design task , product requirements and AM capabilities is needed . 
proposes to base this evaluation on the following criteria : Do available AM materials match the product application ? 
Does the product design fit the build envelope of AM hardware ? 
Can the product functionality improve when applying the following product design modifications or product opportunities ? 
- Part customization - Lightweighting - Use of internal channels or structures - Functional integration - The use of designed surface structures - The use of multi-material or gradient material parts . 
This is to evaluate the balance between the expected economic benefits of product design opportunities against , in most cases , the increased manufacturing costs . 
The dominant objectives established in that last paper are improved part performance , manufacturing and reduction of lead time . 
3.2 AM material , process and machine selection If AM potential has been established then AM resources should be identified , as these affect downstream design choices . 
This includes the decision between direct AM-based production , indirect AM-based production or hybrid approaches . 
Also post-processing steps , needed to reach the required product characteristics , could be identified in this stage . 
For reasons of process chain selection , hybrid production processes can be subdivided based on the method used to generate the bulk of the geometry . 
From an industrial perspective some hybrid technologies use conventional technologies to create the bulk of the part and use AM as a subsequent production method to add detailing features . 
This sequencing of processes can have economic benefits or can result in parts that exceed the standard build chamber dimensions . 
An AM process that produces the bulk of the part using AM technologies and integrates subtractive technologies during the build process can be seen as the second group of hybrid processes . 
For metal parts this sub-group typically consists of DED-based metal additive manufacturing technologies and with milling to post-process functional , internal or hard to reach surfaces . 
Based on interdependencies and sequencing of process steps , alternative processing chains can be generated and evaluated . 
Based on the design requirements and selections already made , Bikas proposes to use screening and selection for AM processes based on criteria related to machine , material , process and part constraints . 
The Senvol database links AM processes to available materials and build envelops of industrial AM machines . 
Also the screening and ranking method proposed by Ashby can be applied for AM material and process selection . 
3.3 Initial cost estimation The decision to apply additive manufacturing for functional parts involves balancing the cost of additive manufacturing against the expected benefits during the design , production and use phase . 
Although the cost/benefits analysis during the early design stage is important , information required for detailed cost estimation is often missing . 
Knowledge on the expected product volume , production technology and required post-processing steps can give insight into the expected costs . 
For the early cost estimation of the production of the part , the costs are often expressed as cost per cm3 of the printed part . 
Most cost estimations found in literature only take the process related post-processing steps into consideration and additional costs must be taken into account when the functionality of the printed part has to be improved also . 
Most cost estimation calculations are based on the assumption of in-house production and an idealized representation of the AM process investigated . 
It is assumed that one AM machine is used for one product the whole life time of the machine , resulting in a high machine load . 
For example , Baumers presents a cost breakdown for metal powder bed based production of a stainless steel 304L product with wire erosion support removal and de-powdering as post processing steps . 
Based on that analysis four major cost aspects were identified : Indirect cost , material costs , labor costs , and risk associated costs . 
Risk related costs include build failures and accounts for 26 % of the AM unit cost . 
In the production of laser based powder bed fusion system was compared to an electron beam variant . 
The AM deposition rates are relatively slow and are identified as the major driver for the manufacturing costs . 
An alternative cost estimation study was presented by Baldinger and focusses on buy scenarios for AM parts . 
The cost estimations are based on reviews of the cost price for obtaining an AM part through commercial service providers and focused on both plastic and metallic parts . 
This research compared twenty-one AM service providers worldwide and found that the main cost drivers for this scenario are total volume of the order , packing density in the build envelope and the number of parts ordered . 
It seems that two strategies are applied by the companies ; group A and B . 
Companies in group A use cost estimation strategies where part cost is almost independent of the number of parts ordered . 
These companies focus on optimizing the utilization of the build volume and have a slightly longer lead time . 
Companies in group B estimate cost for each order separately , have a large difference in cost per cm3 for order sizes one and one-hundred , but have a slightly shorter lead time . 
2 Post-processing can add considerably to the cost of AM parts . 
In many cost models only the costs of the post-processing steps directly related to the AM process are considered . 
For example , Lindeman calculated the post-processing costs for metal parts produced by L-PBF to be between 4 and 14 % . 
Simpson gives a more generic overview of post-processing cost for metal AM . 
3.4 Build job considerations Build jobs are usually considered during the phase of process planning . 
Process planning is one of the most important activities in manufacturing planning and is a pivotal link between design and manufacturing . 
Compared to traditional processing , the context changes for Additive Manufacturing , but it is still within the manufacturing scope . 
Although AM machines are highly integrated and automatic , before enabling the building process for a machine , there are also some preparation tasks that should be done after receiving a design model and its related production requirements . 
In this chain , optimization of the number of parts and their relative positioning in 2D or in 3D , is required when building multiple parts . 
Support generation could be achieved before or after the nesting stage . 
Layer building can then be normally achieved by slicing the 3D set of nested or packed parts with their support structures . 
In some cases this stage is very different because the orientation of the part during the process changes . 
In such cases , the generation of the material deposition trajectory has to be achieved by taking into account non-planar layers . 
Alternative operations of adding and subtracting material and functions are sometimes considered to improve manufacturing efficiency , as an alternative solution to conventional methods like welding and machining . 
This approach , usually named hybrid manufacturing , needs specific AM process planning solutions in order to process from feature decomposition to a complete part recomposition , taking into account sequencing aspects and material excess regions for machining depending on expected dimensional and surface qualities . 
However , orientation and placement have to be validated with respect to global thermal conditions of manufacturing . 
As material and geometry are obtained at the same time , it is mandatory to validate the material quality induced by the input of energy during the material transformation and the consequences on the metallurgical properties of the part . 
Consequently , potential deformations are also calculated and some modifications of strategy are also possible in order to compromise between production performance parameters and part material properties . 
Some simulation tools exist starting from the nested or packed global model integrating support structures . 
For some specific applications , process planning for AM may also generate assembly instructions . 
This occurs when a part 's size exceeds the build volume of a machine and it can be decomposed into several small sections to be made separately . 
3.5 AM process constraints Like with all technologies , there are many constraints to AM . 
This section will focus on four primary constraints that are common to all AM process categories and particularly relevant to the AM of metals : Speed of build , materials , build envelope , and accuracy . 
Although AM used to be called Rapid Prototyping , one is now quite accustomed to having prototypes built quickly , but this is difficult to scale up . 
Furthermore , there is increasing demand for AM to be used in mainstream production , which requires much faster throughput . 
AM has the benefits of geometric freedom , no minimum batch constraint and rapid change between batches , which meets many of the demands of modern manufacturing industry . 
The hunt is therefore on for faster AM technology . 
Many metal AM systems use lasers due to the demand for large amounts of focussed energy . 
The ideal situation would be to provide the required energy over an entire layer simultaneously but so far this has not been demonstrated to be possible . 
A compromise is the supply of multiple laser beams controlled simultaneously . 
Different lasers can be used to process different regions with finer spots being used for more detailed parts and wider beams to process bulk regions . 
Careful attention must be given to beam control so that they do n't affect each other , including the vapour trails from the molten metal regions . 
A contrasting approach to increasing throughput for batch production of metal parts is the use of binder jetting methods or material extrusion with metal-filled binder materials . 
Such methods can achieve faster AM throughput and can be more easily scaled to create larger parts . 
The downsides relate to increases in post-processing times during heat treatment and during machine finishing , if required . 
These requirements are also driving the development of open-architecture , robot-based metal AM systems , like Wire Arc AM and Laser Metal Deposition . 
There is a huge and increasing number of metals and other materials used to make products . 
Most of these metals are carefully chosen to suit product requirements in strength , chemical resistance , thermal properties , processability , cost , etc . 
In comparison , there are a very few materials available in AM . 
All AM processes are suited to a subset of materials , the requirements for which can be very specific , like the need for photo-curable resins . 
Many materials can be formed by AM using thermal energy , but the amounts of energy vary considerably . 
It is not easy to melt metals in an AM process chamber specifically built for polymers for example . 
In addition , raw materials often need to be presented with well-defined morphology , like in filament or carefully-graded powder distributions . 
However , even within a smaller range of materials the processing requirements can still be difficult to specify . 
Metals within L-PBF systems for example will absorb laser energy in different proportions . 
The physics around phase change behaviour and effects in the molten state can all be quite different , significantly affecting the final material microstructure . 
Furthermore , much of this is significantly different from other manufacturing processes like casting and forging . 
All these need to be carefully studied before AM materials can be released to the market . 
As , AM becomes more widespread , one can expect more materials to become available but it is widely accepted that range of materials needs to be increased . 
Having said that , current AM materials like Ti-6Al-4V , 316 stainless steel and CoCr alloys , etc . 
Many products are made from metals because of the needs for strength and accuracy . 
In AM , part strength is often acceptable but part accuracy is very often not . 
Metal parts are often mated with others and so the joining surfaces must align with each other . 
Most metal AM processes create parts with poor surface finish , usually no better than 15 Rz and very often considerably worse . 
Machine finishing is therefore a common requirement as a post-process . 
Thermally induced distortion due to large temperature gradients during builds and corresponding residual stresses is also a common phenomenon for metal AM . 
Features may therefore be imprecisely located and it may be better to provide a machining allowance in the initial AM part design . 
The introduction of hybrid machines that combine AM with subtractive and other manufacturing processes that operate in a sequential manner aim to overcome issues around part accuracy . 
This is particularly useful where the requirement is internal to the part geometry and difficult to achieve as a post-process . 
3.6 AM post-processing constraints For much of the time that AM technology has been under development , post-processing has been something that you would rather not do and eliminate if possible . 
AM is now considered as something that can shorten process chains , not eliminate them entirely . 
Sometimes it may be appropriate to include a design feature in the post-process rather than in the AM build itself . 
Post-processing tasks can be broadly divided in terms of those that can require significant manual intervention and those that can be carried out in a largely automated fashion . 
Of course this depends on the available technology to achieve these tasks as well as the level of investment , quality issues , volume of production , etc . 
Post-processing can also be considered in terms of those that need to be carried out due to the characteristics of the AM process used and those that are more aimed at enhancement of the AM parts . 
Like with the previous classification , there are overlaps or grey areas , around where exactly surface finish fits for example . 
This can also form part of the decision making in the process design The AM technology specific processes mainly refer to the chosen build process and are aimed at providing a consistent quality of output suited to the general application . 
Many processes use support structures which have to be removed somehow , often requiring further finishing of regions where the supports connected with the part . 
Build strategies often revolve around minimising the amount of supports or avoiding key surfaces for aesthetic or accuracy reasons . 
For many machines , flat and curved surfaces can appear different due to the stair-stepping phenomena . 
Abrasive or chemical finishing can be used to make these surfaces appear more uniform . 
A further post-processing task can revolve around excess material that may be adhering to the part surfaces . 
This may be a surrounding material that protects these surfaces or they may be residual material due to inconsistencies in the process , similar to flash in moulding operations . 
Although specific to powder-based AM technology , pore-filling and densification can also be application specific in terms of the material chosen to create a fully dense part . 
Densification can also be in the form of a furnace cycle , perhaps using hot isostatic pressing . 
Since some processes can be slightly heterogeneous in nature , accounting for shrinkage may require careful preparation and difficult to precisely control . 
Metal AM parts in particular are commonly used as fully functional parts . 
Choice of metal as a part material often relates to part strength and while precision can represent a problem . 
Finish machining of key surfaces is often required , much in the same way as we would treat a casting . 
In these specific regions it may be appropriate to grow some of these surfaces in the design phase to provide sufficient machining allowance to ensure high quality , accurate results . 
It can be argued that there will be fewer of these surfaces to finish since it is common thinking that AM allows for part consolidation due to the ability to create internalised features . 
Although it is quite possible to print features like holes and screw-threads using AM , the precision demands on such features can be very stringent and beyond the capacity of the AM technology used . 
It may be possible to save material by printing a hole but the time taken to finish a partially-made hole may be the same , or even longer , than to drill a complete hole in a blank space . 
This may be even more relevant if the hole contained a screw thread . 
Again , it can be argued that this adds complexity to the process decision-making , but it is pertinent when relating to heavily industrial applications . 
Coatings can go from simple paint jobs to improve aesthetics and seal against corrosive atmospheres through to providing significant functional properties , including bioactive features . 
These tasks may require significantly specialised facilities to those used in other production steps and as such may be outsourced . 
This could also be the case with other forms of chemical and heat treatment . 
Many AM parts can include complex internal or difficult to reach features . 
Should these features require finishing , it may be somewhat difficult to achieve a stable quality , even when using automated techniques . 
Some methods are under development to address these issues but more effort could be made and in fact most methods for surface finishing are highly manual in nature . 
3.7 AM quality , inspection and certification Many AM applications can be found in highly regulated industries , like aerospace and medicine . 
This is even the case within the medical industry where one might expect such parts to be customised to suit a patient 's needs and anatomy . 
Quality control , inspection and certification would therefore be conducted in a similar fashion to conventionally manufactured parts . 
Validation in these cases is as much about ensuring consistency in the manufacturing process and traceability of the supply chain as it is about the functionality of the part . 
The US Federal Food and Drug Administration is widely regarded as a key standards organisation around the world and many other countries base their own medical standards on the FDA . 
In 2017 the FDA published guidelines related to technical use of AM in medical devices . 
These guidelines cover aspects related to AM-based design of medical devices as well as how they are manufactured and validated . 
Certification of medical devices is required if there is a medium to high risk potential to the user . 
All implantable devices would be Class II or Class III , whilst AM produced foot orthotics are class I , requiring no premarket notification to prove they have been clinically tested certification ) . 
The medical device manufacturer Stryker released their Spine Tritanium PL Cage around 2016 . 
AM is used to create a complex porous geometry of titanium that aims to promote bone ingrowth in a lumbar spine fusion process . 
It is possible that introduction of this device may have been premature as it is believed that more experimental work is needed to establish the boundaries for fatigue in AM lattice structures . 
It should be noted that similar porous and irregular lattice structures have been used in 100,000s of successful acetabular hip implant cases . 
This issue of possible failure will be even more important should the device have a customisable geometry . 
The FDA refers to these as Customised or Humanitarian-use devices . 
These must also be limited in number and subject to significant medical board scrutiny . 
Medical authorities are currently at a significant cross-road as to how to provide custom implants for more widespread use . 
Aerospace certification , through the Federal Aviation Authority , also appears to be at a similar cross-road . 
However , it is noted that many parts already in use could be repaired when damaged using AM techniques , most specifically using Directed Energy Deposition . 
Many safety critical parts , like turbine blades , could be repaired in this way . 
Emphasis must therefore be on the AM process to ensure that functionality is maintained to a suitable standard . 
For example Air New Zealand are saving significant repair costs by making their own replacement seat tray-tables using materials like the flame-retardant ULTEM 9085 polymer material from Stratasys . 
This is just part of a much wider push to demonstrate a sustainable industry for AM in aerospace . 
Many of the above issues for medical and aerospace are reflected in a more general form within the standards under development by ISO Technical Committee 261 in conjunction with the ASTM F42 Group . 
Numerous techniques , like the printing of test coupons alongside critical components , machine calibration and material storage , etc . 
This has led to significant improvements in process monitoring within industrial scale AM machines . 
Many polymer-based systems have camera monitoring that allow determining the build status and remote intervention if problems can be seen . 
Many metal L-PBF systems also have optional laser power and melt-pool sensing to determine the state of part with the possibility of detecting a failure before it damages the machine . 
4 Tools and methods for designing lightweight parts Lightweight design always has been a hot topic in structural engineering . 
AM processes can produce highly complex structures , constructed using both internally and externally very complex surfaces . 
More importantly , there is no clear relationship between the complexity of the part and the associated production cost , providing more freedom to explore the design space to its full extent . 
As a result , not only conventional lightweighting design tools are used for AM , but also some new methods have emerged to fully grasp the benefits of AM . 
In relation to lightweight design for AM , four groups of methods and tools can be identified : topology optimization , generative design , lattice structure filling , and bio-inspired design . 
4.1 Topology optimization Topology optimization was originally used for mechanical design problems to answer a layout optimization question : how to put the right material in the right place of a pre-defined design space ? 
The objective was to obtain the expected mechanical properties at minimum material use . 
The method uses numerical analysis and design solution update steps in an iterative way , mostly guided by gradient computation or non-gradient discrete approaches . 
Traditionally , TO is driven by an objective function , minimizing or maximizing while being subjected to a set of predefined constraints , such as mass , deformation , vibration frequency , etc . 
Usually , continuous design variables are used to solve the TO problem in a discretized way . 
During this optimization iteration process , segments of the predefined initial design space are step by step removed so as to arrive at the minimal part volume/mass . 
Initial methods developed remove materials bit by bit using a strain energy distribution and a preset threshold value . 
More advanced methods use genetic algorithms that both add and remove materials . 
porous structures and lattice structures , but with relaxed mathematical constraints . 
As stated in , even current pure TO studies still face problems , such as efficiency , general applicability , ease of use , etc . 
Many of them only use relatively simple boundary conditions with limited constraints , e.g . 
When introducing extra AM related constraints such as support structures/overhangs , minimum printable features , anisotropic material properties , heat-transfer , thermal strain/stress into TO , this would result in more complex constraints or boundary conditions . 
This again would result in more difficulties for the TO process to find the solutionwith an effective and fast converging simulation process . 
Attracted by the great potential of AM , researchers investigated TO with AM constraints , focussing on generating an optimal topologically lightweight material layout , to be printed without any manufacturing problems . 
Therefore , recent researches on TO for DfAM are geared towards print-ready designs bridging challenges in design and printing . 
One is to represent AM constraints with mathematical models and embed them into the TO iteration process . 
The other is to use TO to generate one or a set of finite reference design solutions and apply design rules or experience to adapt these solutions manually or automatically to the AM constraints . 
This last category thus applies AM constraints in the post-processing stage of a given TO result . 
For ease of practice , most of the earliest works directly tried to use existing traditional TO , or other similar structure optimization methods , for lightweight design in DfAM , without considering any AM constraints . 
The main reason for this was the assumption that AM can overcome manufacturing problems of TO generated structure as these structures would encounter in conventional manufacturing processes . 
Although the 2D or 3D TO produced structures could be printed by polymer AM processes , the direct application of the existing non-tailored TO may have difficulty using metallic AM . 
This is more complicated due to the multi-physical phenomena which can not be handled by relatively simple macro mechanic and geometric based calculations . 
A large number of researchers began to associate specific AM constraints with their TO process , either as a TO process driver or a TO post-processor . 
However , their efforts are mainly focusing at 2D problems with consideration of only one simple or limited subset of AM constraints , e.g . 
support volume or overhang area . 
For example Leary , describes a variant where traditional TO is conducted and a boundary decomposition algorithm is applied to detect and decompose the internal or external boundary areas needing support structures . 
Then , the detected and decomposed relatively large cavities are filled with a set of smaller generated boundaries so as to avoid the appearance of overhang as shown in 7 . 
In that example even though a sophisticated decomposition algorithm was designed and the use of support structure in printing was mostly avoided , the result is still far from optimal . 
2D results sometimes are quite useless in practice since the broadened design freedom exists in 3D , not 2D . 
Taking the TO example in 7 , we can easily rotate the 2D result around the X-axis in the 3D and then we will find that there is no need of support structures . 
This means all the optimization steps are useless if we simply change the build orientation . 
The dilemma may be caused by two factors : the TO researcher has a lack of knowledge on the AM processes or the direct embedding of AM constraints with mathematical models in the 2D or 3D TO processes is quite tough . 
Readers may find more representative research on 2D TO for AM lightweight design in . 
To extend beyond 2D , researchers adopted the decomposition method as proposed in and tried to extend it to 3D TO for AM . 
However , like the 2D cases presented above , reducing support structures is based on the compromise of adding more volume in the structure itself , which will decrease the global optimality . 
In addition , it is still not a real 3D TO for AM design since the decomposition and overhang angle control with volume filling still uses 2D operations . 
`For these investigations discussed above , the 2D TO process is relatively easy to realize when only considering overhang or support structure AM constraint . 
However , complexity in AM is generally manifested in 3D . 
Hence , a lot of recent research is directed towards the development of tailored 3D TO methods for AM design . 
As is the case with the 2D variants , these 3D TO practices mainly focus on how to minimize overhang area or support volumes , as these constraints are relatively easy to integrate in the TO process . 
In , intensive discussions and experimental computations were conducted for the support volume constrained 3D TO for AM design . 
Level set based Pareto is adopted to control and alter the shape boundary where support structure may be required . 
It is hard to find a unique optimal solution , as each solution is a compromise between the constraints added . 
A set of Pareto solutions are provided , as seen in 9 . 
As stated in , the elimination of support volume may be possible but will hardly work for real 3D TO problems in AM design . 
Even though it is hard to totally avoid the use of support structures , researchers in still tried to obtain optimal 3D TO structures without supports for several relative simple demonstration cases . 
To avoid the use of supports this study includes a simplified AM fabrication model , implemented as a layerwise filtering procedure into a topology optimization formulation . 
In this way , unprintable geometries are excluded from the design space , resulting in fully self-supporting optimized designs . 
Similar ideas can be found in where support constraint is applied . 
However , this as a compromise between the structural performance and global volume . 
The author of also understands that it would be hard to avoid the use of support structure , and proposed to optimize the 3D structure with necessary support structure in parallel so as to obtain a better compromise . 
In this study , two separate density fields were proposed to describe the component and support structure layouts respectively . 
A simple critical overhang angle was imposed into the TO process as a constraint . 
The examples presented in 10 and 11 show that more volume used for supports , which can be seen as waste material , results in more material saved for the main structure . 
Actually , optimizing the functionality of supports for 3D structures to be printed by metallic AM processes would be a more important goal than optimizing material savings , since the support structures in metallic AM processes have a profound impact on the final printing quality . 
For example , the build orientation has a direct impact on the TO process since it determines the TO solution space . 
In , the combined optimization of part topology , support structure and build orientation is investigated . 
The research into these complex interrelationships are limited to 2D simple cases , where the impact of build orientation to TO and support optimization is clear . 
This implies that more work should be done in this direction for real 3D industrial cases . 
If we take the slicing and toolpath planning as additional considerations into the 3D TO process , the complexity would be increased even further . 
Finally , there are researchers working on level set TO methods to include AM material deposition path/toolpath as constraints to control sharp angles , deposition gaps , minimum inner hole size and minimum strut size in the topology formation process . 
If the manufacturability of an AM TO solution could not be guaranteed , any kind of optimal design may bring no application value . 
In , manufacturability of the AM components and the cooling rate are considered as constraints and a shape based TO method is proposed . 
The manufacturability is checked for each layer . 
More recently , a new constraint function of the domain which controls the negative impact of porosity on elastic structures in the framework of shape and topology optimization is defined as a special shape derivative and proposed to embed into a level set TO process for AM lightweight design . 
Even these methods can obtain a manufacturable TO layout , the boundaryproblems brought by a density based TO method still pose challenges for AM processes . 
Therefore , level set based methods or boundary decomposition with spline interpolation are usually used to do post-processing of the TO results . 
From the discussion of existing research presented above , there are still a lot of difficulties for the development of tailored TO methods and tools for AM lightweight design . 
The work discussed is all based on a single material showing isotropic properties . 
However , with digital controlled deposition , theoretically AM can print different materials with different gradients for multi-functional structures . 
For example , jetting-based AM processes can print smart structures with multiple polymers . 
Hence , TO methods and tools to help designers to allocate different material to different regions with optimal quantities for an expected multi-functional structure become critical . 
In , a multivariate SIMP method is proposed to optimize an application dependent multi-material layout . 
The inclusion of multiple materials in the topology optimization process has the potential to eliminate the narrow , weak , hinge-like sections that are often present in single-material compliant mechanisms . 
The demonstration example is the realization of a 3-phase , multi-material 2D compliant mechanism . 
One can foresee that if some work in the future can help realize multi-material topology optimization for 3D metal structures , then the complexity capability of AM can be further explored not only for lightweight design but also for a combined multi-function design . 
Currently , metallic FDM process with metallurgical solidification as a post-process can theoretically realize the joining of multiple metals . 
There has been extensive exploration of TO for AM in diverse application examples either via standard TO tools or AM oriented tools . 
Reports have presented industrial design cases to show the great potential of TO tools for AM lightweight design . 
EADS presented a component for Airbus . 
However , there are no details about how to embed the AM constraints in the design process of the example . 
In the second example , a minimum AM feature size is embedded into the density based TO process and allows to define arbitrary objective functions for multi-physic fields , which is crucial for gradient-based , and thus all topology optimization . 
An example on the comparison study of designing a heat sink between traditional parametric optimization and AM oriented TO is presented in 15 . 
Apart from density-based methods or level set methods , evolutionary TO methods were also investigated for AM design . 
In , a recently developed topology optimization method called Iso-XFEM is used . 
This method is capable of generating high resolution topology optimized solutions using isolines/isosurfaces of a structural performance criterion . 
XFEM is similar to the BESO method , but removes or adds materials within elements . 
However , there is no description how the TO process is tailored for AM . 
It is not difficult to image that embedding AM constraints into an evolutionary TO process would be more difficult than that of density or level set based methods since the process uses discrete optimization . 
In addition , evolutionary based methods still have more difficulties in selection of stopping criteria or convergence analysis . 
As shown and discussed above , though some commercial tools are ready for use , very little AM constraints are considered . 
The current TO methods and commercialized tools still stay very close to the traditional TO tools . 
In addition , including both academic and industrial examples , those studies commonly lack experimental verification and there is no explicit agreement by the scientific community on their aspect ratio , which sets barriers for comparison and TO performance benchmarking . 
Therefore , there is still slot of work to be done for developing standard testing and experimental benchmarking examples . 
4.2 Generative design For the TO methods discussed above , people are trying to develop a fully automatic way to define a unique optimal lightweight structure design . 
However , it is difficult to converge to the optimal solution , especially when multiple objectives are set . 
Hence , a compromise should be made to sample the solution space when the theoretical global optimal could not be located . 
This introduces another design method for AM , generative design . 
GD is a set of methods that apply a generative system , rule-based or algorithm-based , to explore the design space and generate candidate solutions for designers . 
It is usually practiced for architectural design . 
In structure design , we usually use the second method , applying evolutionary algorithms to sample and generate design solutions that are close to predefined objectives and criteria . 
in , it is easy to adapt to evolutionary generative design for AM . 
Based on traditional TO methods , discretized version of the density based SIMP method , commercial software providers announced new functions of generative design for AM in their structure design tools and presented a couple of industrial design cases with numerical results . 
For example , 16 gives one design example with a set of filtered candidate solutions . 
Similarly , as TO , GD is not new , but introducing AM constraints in traditional GD is still difficult . 
To solve this problem , recently , researchers developed a new evolutionary generative design method for AM lightweight design to mimic termite behavior for volume construction . 
The proposed methodology uses multi-agent algorithms that simultaneously design , structurally optimize and appraise the manufacturability of parts produced by additive manufacturing . 
Voxels are used to carry the design rules and manufacturing constraints for reasoning and combination during the geometry evolution process . 
However , this method considers support structures as the only AM constraint and has difficulty to include more . 
For generative design for AM , there is still a lot of work to do to include more AM constraints and develop more efficient decision making tools to help designers define optimization criteria and candidate solution ranking schemes . 
Some commercial tools are now available however . 
On the other hand , when doing structure design via generative design methods , the global optimum and computational cost should be given attention . 
Recently , researchers began to combine TO with generative models , e.g. 
, generative adversarial networks , and proposed a new concept , deep generative design , which owns the learning capability from the iteration process and existing design data . 
These concepts hold the potential to better integrate existing AM processing knowledge into the generative design procedure to populate and explore more qualified AM design solutions . 
Certainly , generative design is not only used for topology optimization but also can be applied to form synthesis , lattice and surface structure optimization and trabecular structures as a way to explore more design freedom using AM . 
4.3 Lattice structure filling Directly removing or adding material in the design space to search for the global optimal material topology solution is common to TO and generative design methods and , as stated above , there are many difficulties . 
As a compromise , generative design can include human knowledge to interactively select the candidate solutions so as to reduce the problem complexity . 
Therefore , this is an indirect lightweight design method for AM , which is also called lattice configuration , 18 . 
To obtain lattice structures , generally we have two approaches : 1 . 
Homogenization and 2 . 
Density based mapping . 
The former homogenizes the lattice structure as representative volume elements , like solid material . 
The lattice structures are similar to the micro porous for the traditional solid structure in homogenized volumes . 
In this way , special properties should be assigned to the representative volumes and then we can apply traditional TO or other structure optimization methods to operate the special volumes . 
Representative researches that apply this method can be found in and 19 illustrates the general workflow . 
The second approach maps the density values obtained from non-penalized TO results onto the explicit predefined lattice structures with optional adaptation to improve the approximation accuracy of mechanical response . 
Based on this approach , uniform or graded lattice structures can be obtained . 
Example studies can be found in . 
20 shows an example where different predefined lattice structures are used to map the solid volume TO contours . 
Although the two appraoches are not hard to understand , the operation and optimization of lattice structures is quite complicated , especially for large size structure design . 
The first problem is the representation/digitalization of lattice structures . 
Usually , solid representation or surface representation can be used for individual lattice units . 
But when filled into solid hulls , the number of lattice units is very big , which makes the CAD file difficult to operate , including sweeping , meshing/mapping and tessellation . 
Secondly , when doing numerical simulation , the computation cost is much higher since many more finite element units are required . 
Thirdly , when filling lattice structures into solid hulls , one needs to use uniform lattice in trimming or non-uniform lattice with conformal interface , which depends on specific design cases . 
Some researchers stated that conformal lattice structures have better structural performance than that of uniformed . 
However , the operation of conformal lattice is more complicated and more difficult to control the manufacturability since they are not , like uniform lattices usually are , derived from benchmarking results . 
After that , the computation cost is a big issue , not only for the representation , but also for simulation and manufacturing . 
That is why some researchers proposed to use kernel or symbolic representations for lattice units . 
Finally , the most important challenge is how to obtain the global optimum when using lattice structures . 
The approximation process further reduces the original design space and introduces more errors . 
Predefined and benchmarked limited lattice structures with fixed parameters are just a subset of the design variants . 
Actually , even for predefined lattice units , there are more parameters that can be modified and adjusted to specific design cases . 
Currently , many optimization studies for lattice structures are only limited to density , represented by strut diameter , and very little work focuses on parameter optimization and computation benchmarking for large lattice structure design cases . 
Therefore , to be practical , current methods and tools from academic codes or commercial software tools all adopt knowledge based methods with TO methods for lattice filling . 
Usually , a lattice library is built to store predefined lattice units , benchmarked with numerical simulation or manufacturability analysis , and then a limited set of control options , concerning the lattice unit size , strut diameter , layout orientation , etc. 
, are available for the filling operation . 
This is the main workflow of current tools . 
As said before , although relatively small or medium sized lattice structures can be obtained , one not only sacrifices the stiffness but also it may be more difficult to search for the original global optimal lightweight design solution . 
If one only considers the lightweight effect in the design , lattice filling may not be the optimal choice . 
However , lattice structures can bring other benefits , e.g . 
energy absorption and heat conduction that solid structures may not have . 
This would be an important factor to encourage research and practice in the lattice domain . 
5 Tools and methods for optimizing surface structure As discussed above , the global optimal for structure design is usually hard to obtain . 
Similar to lattice structures , which are made artificially , natural porous structures become a set of special elements to deal with specific design requirements . 
Examples include among others lightweight infill , porous scaffolds , energy absorbers , micro-reactors , heat conductors , or self-adaptating structures . 
These structures/functionalities have been known for some time , but due to the ability of AM to produce these complex structures , they now become part of the solution principles that can be applied by the product designer . 
Hence , the mimicking and post-processing of natural inspired or randomly generated complex topologies become a new design practice , which is called bio-inspired or biomimetic design . 
Its goal is to generate either lightweight structures with unexpected mechanical properties , similar to the lightweight design methods mentioned in the last section , or multi-functional surface structures as addressed here . 
This type of design is more difficult than that of relatively regular or conformal periodic lattice structures . 
Hence , the design and simulation focuses more on the form and shape of the surfaces while the mechanical properties and AM constraints are hard to consider due to their extreme complexity . 
Generally , two design approaches , direct/indirect reproduction of natural topologies via reverse engineering and generic bio-inspiration using design rules or guidelines , are conducted in this domain . 
Driven by the wide application in the medical domain , scaffolds and implants usually require similar internal surface topologies to the natural structures they are mimicing . 
cell spreading , strength distribution . 
The main methods to generate irregular porous structures with complex internal surface topologies are either filling or hollowing materials from an initial design via specific algorithms . 
A representative filling method is Triply Periodic Minimal Surface , which is an implicit surface with intricate structures . 
Researchers add different operation algorithms to do the filling with these surface units so as to approximate the original CAD model 's skin . 
For the hollowing process , sub-volumes are generated via a set of specific algorithms within the original 3D CAD model and used to do Boolean operations . 
A shape function is applied in to design a pore model and then a subtractive Boolean operation is conducted between the pore and the original solid CAD models to obtain the final scaffold model . 
The process is illustrated in 23 . 
Similarly , a Voronoi tessellation method is adopted in to do the material hollowing . 
Apart from the internal surface structure generation , external surface structure design also attracts attention since using AM to print complex shapes for art or customized shapes has become popular . 
In artistic design , T-splines and Voronoi tessellation or predefined pattern bases are commonly used for defining complex surface topologies . 
In , a generative design method is applied to populate complex surface topologies via the use of predefined patterns . 
A recursive grammar is set for the generation of solid boundary surface models , suitable for a variety of design domains . 
Freeform 3D surface topologies can be formed by a set of 2-manifold polygonal sub meshes as shown in 24 . 
However , the optimization for artistic design is not so obvious . 
To develop special surface structures for personalized casts/braces , a new topology optimization method is proposed in . 
The novel TO method is based on thin plate elements on the two-dimensional manifold surfaces instead of 3D solid elements so as to reduce the computation cost for shape optimization . 
To decrease the threshold of customization of surface structure for the public when using AM , in , an interactive CAD design tool is proposed . 
This tool uses predefined reference unit models with the inputs of user 's stylings to automatically generate customized hollowed surface topologies for fashion . 
Similar to other existing 3D porous structure design methods , this tool is mainly based on Voronoi tessellation and curve fitting methods . 
26 shows the surface topology generation process . 
The main advantage of this tool is that its predefined reference models can be benchmarked and tested to ensure manufacturability , which will avoid problems during AM . 
Similar to structure topology optimization , surface structure design and optimization face more difficulties in the modelling , simulation and embracing of AM constraints . 
This requires more work on the data structure , simulation driven analysis and optimization . 
A lightweight and convenient analysis platform should be developed to efficiently acquire the calculation results for valid surface structure design and optimization . 
Currently , there is very little research invesigating the design guidelines of surface structure in AM . 
Most of the design pratices are limited at non-metallic AM processes . 
However , there is an ugent need in the medical application domain where special functional surface structures are critical . 
27 presents a dental component where a bio-insipred surface structure with a special treatment function is printed using L-PBF . 
Reverse engineering is used to generate the surface structure . 
However , the modelling and function validation of such surface structure has not yet been studied . 
Hence , design methods and modelling tools should be developed to support the medical fabrication application for metal AM processes . 
6 Manual optimization of internal part topology One of the enablers within AM is the ability to optimize the internal part topology . 
In the previous sections automated topology optimization procedures for internal and surface part geometry were discussed . 
In many cases these automated methods are not required or applicable and other ways of defining the internal part topology are used . 
With subtractive methods , structuring the product internal surfaces is hard or limited to very basic geometric features and production steps . 
Many of the commercially successful AM applications relate to internal transport of media through the AM product . 
In relation to the additive manufacturing challenges , three subsets of AM features for internal transport of media can be identified ; macro channel geometry , mini/micro channels and printed permeability . 
For macro channel geometry , down-facing surfaces of the channel may experience stability problems during printing . 
For mini/micro channels , the feature size may be close to the limitations of the printing device which may result in walls failing to print , channels being blocked and cumbersome removal of excess print material . 
Finally , AM permeable structures are created by ensuring process-induced porosity . 
Here the main challenge is finding stable process settings that allow for both the production of permeable and solid structures . 
6.1 Internal geometry at macro level In classical part production , channels for the transportation of viscous media are manufactured using conventional subtractive production methods like drilling , thus resulting in straight channels with round cross section and sharp corners . 
With the use of AM the location and shape of these channels can be optimized . 
In L-PBF and at macro level , the top surfaces of the round holes have the tendency to sag or collapse , and the cross section of the channel has to be optimized . 
Thomas investigated the quality of produced channels and found that round holes up to a diameter of 7mm could be printed with minimal problems . 
Above that , sagging of the overhanging surface is noticed , as well as possible curl , leading to recoater collisions . 
Other channel designs have been proposed . 
With the use of AM , cooling channels in injection molding inserts can be made conformal to the mold 's product surface and located in areas critical to the quality of the die 's function . 
Conformal cooling channels have been used to reduce cycle time and product warpage . 
Kitayama compared the effect of conformal cooling channels and conventional cooling channels for injection molding . 
Results showed an improvement of the cycle time of 53 % and a reduction of product warpage by 46 % compared to conventional cooling channels . 
Although conformal cooling for IM is widely researched and benefits have been proven , actual application in industry lags behind . 
It is considered beneficial only for complex plastic geometries , that are difficult to cool quickly and uniformly and for very high production volumes . 
H researched using conformal cooling channels in hot metal extrusion and also found significant production efficiency improvements . 
Current research into manifold design has two main themes ; mass reduction and flow optimization . 
Conventional methods create straight cooling channels , where connections result in pressure loss , increase the temperature and noise , which influences the reliability and lifetime of the system . 
Ma investigated multiple geometry adjustments which can be made when using AM . 
AM enables the design of fluent corners , smooth transitions between cooling channel diameters and the removal of unwanted drilling cavities , resulting in decrease in pressure loss by up to a factor of 3 . 
6.2 Mini and Micro internal geometry in AM For mini and micro levels of geometry , used for transport of fluidic media , the minimal feature size of the AM technology chosen is often the limiting factor . 
Thomas investigated some of these limits , for example as shown in 31 . 
Printing of free standing walls and pilars is also a limiting factor as both the achievable minimal cross sectional area and maximal aspect ratio are limited . 
In sectors like heating , ventilation , and air conditioning , automotive , aero and electro-cooling , heat exchangers play a vital role in the energy efficiency . 
The heat transfer performance is dependent on the surface area to volume ratio . 
Using mini and micro channels , this ratio can be increased , thus increasing the performance/mass ratio of the heat exchanger . 
Arie investigated the performance of Ti64 air-water manifold-microchannel heat exchangers . 
Key to the intended efficiency increase was the production of thin fins with high aspect ratio 's . 
Non AM-based production alternatives were considered slow , costly , not able to meet the aspect ratios or not possible to produce in the desired material . 
Compared to classical designs the manifold micro-channel show respectively 30performance increase in gravimetric heat transfer density . 
It was argued that inaccuracy of the production process reduced the manifold performance as some of the channels were blocked and the ideal fin thickness of 150 could not be realized . 
Mei put the use of AM to a case study where they produced a highly integrated catalytic burner for auxiliary power units based on PEM-fuel cells . 
This resulted in a volume reduction of 70 % from 41L to 11L and a weight reduction of 60 % from 30 kg to 12 kg . 
6.3 Printed permeability Calignano investigated the relation between material and process properties to fabricate both stochastic and non-stochastic porous structures . 
Parts were created using three different scanning strategies scanning lines , and rotating scanning patterns for each new layer ) and by modifying the hatch distance hd . 
It was found that hatch distances in excess of 0.20 mm were needed to be able to create distinct walls . 
Below that , wall formation was hampered by agglomeration of powder particles . 
The rotating scanning strategy using hd of 0.5 mm resulted in stochastic , foam-like structures , both with open and closed pores and porosity values of 43Collins investigated the use and production of a permeable membrane heatsink produced by AM . 
In order to find the process settings that will result in permeable walls , test cubes were printed with fins on top with a height of 1 mm and wall thicknesses varying from 150 to 500 The core of the cubes was used to determine bulk porosity . 
All fins below 300 failed to print while 300 fins were successfully printed only for process settings resulting in low bulk porosity . 
The 400 and 500 fins printed successfully for all process settings used . 
7 Functional material complexity The design process can also consider that to solve some technological problems or to optimise some local properties , some processes allow building up multi-material objects or objects with material gradients . 
In some cases there has been significant progress although it increases the complexity of simulation and of process planning of AM-based value chains . 
In addition , there are no standard functionalities in the commercial software that could support such definitions , which must be managed manually or directly defined on the legacy software associated to specific processes . 
One basic functionality relates to material gradient of polymers and elastomer parts manufactured with voxel-based technologies . 
The design process criticaly addresses the local characteristics of the material for each voxel of the object . 
Another feature that is mostly used for metallic parts is lattice structure that could help in designing internal structures used to support the parts but also to minimize weight with respect to given functionalities . 
In highly developed sectors for metal fabrication , in particular aeronautic and medical applications , AM processes use many metals like stainless steel , titanium , aluminum , cobalt chrome and nickel alloys . 
An important feature of metal is its microstructure . 
For a given metal , there can be a variety of microstructural features that affect its mechanical properties . 
The size of grains , micro-segregation of alloying elements , phases within the metal and size of dendrites relates to the tensile strength and ductility . 
During the AM process , the microstructure is formed in-situ and would depend obviously on the process parameters and material used . 
The microstructure of metals determines the mechanical properties of the part such as yield strength , ductility and hardness . 
Varying the process parameters like the energy sources and fill patterns can lead to differences in grain structure . 
Such issues are both a very important potential advantage but also an additional complexity when considering the AM design process . 
Functionally Graded Materials are defined as a class of advanced materials characterised by spatial variation in material composition across the volume , contributing to corresponding changes in material properties in line with the functional requirements . 
The multi-functional status of a component is tailored through the material allocation at microstructure to meet an intended performance requirement . 
Microstructural gradation contributes to a smooth transition between properties of the material . 
Another approach is based on Young 's modulus variation for the determination of the mechanical propertiesgradients , and consequently material microstructure or composition variations . 
Another interesting proposition comes from who proposes an interpretation of the material with intermediary density as a lattice cellular structure that could be composed by several materials . 
Homogeneous FGM composition creates porosity or density gradients by modulating the spatial microstructure or morphology of lattice structures across the volume of material through a voxel approach . 
This method can be called densification FGMThe directionality , magnitude and density concentration of the material substance in a monolithic anisotropic composite structure contributes to functional deviations such as stiffness and elasticity . 
The gradual transition from a solid exterior to a porous core leads to an excellent strength-to-weight ratio . 
Even if new standards are partly addressing such models , the development of mathematical representations useful for both design and simulation is still in progress . 
FGM can also address the aspect of multi-materiality through an approach of dynamically composed gradients or complex morphology . 
The geometric and material arrangement of the phases controls the overall functions and properties of the FGM component . 
Multi-material FGM seeks to improve the interfacial bond between dissimilar or incompatible materials . 
Distinct boundaries can be removed through a heterogeneous compositional transition from a dispersed to an interconnected second phase structure , graded layers with discrete compositional parameters or smooth concentration gradients . 
Once again , material models are too complicated to be used for simulation . 
Demonstration and validation during the design phase of expected characteristics is still to be expected in a general manner . 
But this is an interesting issue to be expected because , by fusing one material to another three-dimensionally using a dynamic gradient , the printed component can have the optimum properties of both materials . 
It can be transitional in weight , yet retaining its toughness , wear resistance , impact resistance or its physical , chemical , biochemical or mechanical properties . 
Multi-material FGM can also provide location-specific properties tailored at small sections or strategic locations around pre-determined parts . 
Some AM technologies are providing such opportunities . 
Construction of such parts could be of interest to solve design issues in order to avoid multi-part assemblies or complex joints for example . 
Simulation models are still to be implemented and validated mostly because the design of heterogeneous compositional gradients are very complex . 
They can be divided into four types : a transition between two materials , three materials or above , switched composition between different locations or a combination of density and compositional gradation . 
The key design parameters of FGM include the dimension of the gradient vector , the geometric shape and the repartition of the equipotential surfaces . 
The features and functionality of the component are further determined by the direction of the gradient within the material composition . 
The design and types of the volumetric gradient can be classified according to 1D , 2D and 3D , and distribution of materials uniformly or through special patterns . 
Defining the optimum material distribution function requires extensive knowledge of material data that includes the chemical composition , its characteristics and the manufacturing constraints . 
At present , there are no design guidelines on material compatibility , mixing range for materials with variable and non-uniform properties and a framework for optimal property distribution such as choice of spatial , gradient distribution and the arrangement of transition phases is also lacking . 
When generating graded components of high to low strength , the changing material properties brought about by modifications to the microstructure have to be carefully measured and quantified . 
Tamas-Williams suggested two useful approaches to model the response of functionally graded components using the exponential law idealisation and material elements Finite Element Method analysis can also be used to show and suggest an optimised set of elements under pre-determined circumstances to provide a better understanding of how the material properties will behave . 
In order to generalise the use of FGM , it is crucial to understand the resulting differences between the predicted and real components . 
By knowing the required mix of properties , the required arrangement of phases , and compatibility of materials design rules and methods have to be established to avoid undesirable results . 
Knowledge of the relationship can be gained through shared databases as a catalogue of material performance information . 
Richards first proposed a computational approach of using CPPN encodings and a scalable algorithm using NEAT to embed functional morphologies and macro-properties of physical features using multi-material FGM through voxel-based descriptions by a function of its Cartesian coordinates . 
Some progresses are still expected but FGM or multi-material parts in general are being seriously considered as solutions for design evolution of products in the future . 
This is already used for polymers and elastomers and this is in progress for metallic products . 
8 Assembly and part integration considerations It is well recognized that it is possible to exploit the potential of additive manufacturing at product level . 
As one may infer by the existing standards , AM technologies already play a significant role not only for single parts but also at product level . 
Therefore , the classical Design for Assembly approaches have to be reconsidered in order to take advantage of these AM opportunities . 
An n-part product may be classified as static , movable , or compliant assembly and it may have components of the same or different materials . 
AM technologies enable the possibility to produce not only a single part of an assembly , but directly the assembled product . 
This review shows many possible joints directly fabricated either using polymers or metals . 
Furthermore a deep discussion of polymer-based non-assembly mechanisms may be found in , proving that the polymer-based AM technologies are close to maturity for this kind of application . 
35 shows a metallic compliant joint for a snake-like surgical robot , produced by PBF . 
In 36 , the detail design of a rotational joint and a snap-fit feature are shown for a nanosatellite metallic cubic structure fabricated by L-PBF . 
But what about the design rules to fully exploit the AM technologies in assembly manufacturing ? 
In the following , a brief analysis of the design rules and in particular of the part consolidation steps in designing a product will be considered . 
8.1 Assembly design rules As deeply discussed in , when dealing with assemblies and AM technologies , one main issue still to be adequately addressed is the geometrical product specification . 
In fact , no specific ISO-GPS or ASME-GD & T standard dedicated to AM processes exists , leaving design as a cumbersome process of defining geometrical requirements of assembly features or of single parts using a language dedicated to conventionally manufactured products . 
Referring to an assembly with fixed connection type , general rules to design fasteners/connectors , in particular snap-fit features , are presented with respect to polymer-based AM processes in , and to metal-based ones in . 
These general rules address issues on fastener/connector shape , wall thickness , gap width , staircase effect on sloped surfaces , and on the influence of anisotropy on the assembly product mechanical behavior . 
Dealing with non-assembly mechanisms , design rules are discussed mainly referring to polymer-based AM processes like extrusion-based , material jetting , and vat photopolymerization processes . 
The design rules refer to the minimization and the removal of the supports used during the non-assembly product fabrication , the effect of build orientation on the smoothness of the mechanism , and the selection of the clearance between assembled parts . 
Considering the latter issue , in a benchmark is proposed to assess the lowest clearance limits for non-assembly mechanisms . 
8.2 Part consolidation Part consolidation is the first and most relevant step in design for assembly . 
But this is not the case when exploiting AM processes since they enable non-assembly mechanisms , multi-material printing , and easier functional integration . 
A significant example of AM part consolidation is the one reported in . 
The original portable hydraulic manifold was used for in-situ testing of aircraft components , a 17-part assembly , and was completely redesigned as a single-part product , with 60 % less weight , the same footprint , a 53 % shorter height , and with a more reliable and robust design with respect to the original one , deeply exploiting a metal powder bed fusion technology . 
Nevertheless , the main outcome of the reported experience is the proposed redesign approach for part consolidation using metal AM . 
The proposed approach is general , well structured , and detailed enough to be immedialtely applicable at industrial level , but it needs further testing on different case studies to prove the benefits . 
An interesting framework to part consolidation and functional integration exploiting AM technologies is presented and validated in . 
In a further development of their approach , the authors have recently addressed the relevant problem of detecting the possible candidates for part consolidation , as reported in . 
Potentially , when dealing with part consolidation , the designer may consider the need of part decomposition . 
The need to increase the number of parts in a product fabricated by AM may be due to many reasons : printability , productivity , functionality , artistry , and interchangeability . 
Printability is actually the main reason being related to the limited working envelope of AM machines . 
In the part decomposition problem in AM is addressed , but it is the first and unique example of research on this topic . 
9 Conclusion and future challenges DfAM is about design for the whole AM product life cycle . 
This paper has presented a framework of tools and methods for DfAM and has shown the strong interaction between these life cycle stages and AM product design . 
The state of the art was presented on many of these design tools and their applicability was illustrated using many of the latest examples from research and industry . 
9.1 AM suitability exploration A growing number of companies are exploring the commercial use of AM within their supply chain . 
For that , better methods and tools are needed to help the designer obtain an overview that identifies the match between functional and economical demands of the intended product and all stages of AM in product development . 
Methods for early cost estimation are lacking , while current figures for production cost per cm3 are not based on established calculation methods and lack experimental and industrial verification . 
Late life cycle stages of postprocessing , inspection and certification have a significant impact on production cost and general applicability of AM , but these stages are underrepresented in current DfAM approaches . 
Finally , more education on Additive Manufacturing is needed , as the majority of product designers and engineers are still trained to think subtractive . 
9.2 Product design for AM goals Topology optimization enables strategies that go beyond lightweight design to include minimizing support usage and thermal deformation , optimizing local heat input , and with that the local material properties , porosity and strength . 
TO methods need further enhancement to tackle optimization as a 3D problem while taking all later product development stages into account . 
Generative design strategies have the benefit that they generate many possible design solutions , but as is the case with TO , few production and inspection constraints are currently integrated . 
Lattice structures show explicit benefits , especially in application fields involving energy absorption and heat conduction . 
They are however computationally intensive , which limits the optimization possibilities for large lattices to a limited set of parameters . 
When looking at the part interior , specially designed porosity is seen as a promising new feature for internal transport of gasses and fluids . 
Both the optimal process settings as well as models for their application need further research to be applicable in everyday product design . 
To fully exploit the benefits of functional material complexity , further research must be conducted on rules and CAD representations of FGM related design intent . 
However , the development of design tools and methods is still a matter of basic research and far from industrial application . 
The future of additive manufacturing is also looking towards 4D applications where those challenges will be even more relevant . 
For the final optimization of geometry so that it combines AM benefits with efficient production and inspection , a lot of research has been conducted . 
At an individual process level design knowledge is available and constantly being extended or refined . 
Further research is needed to enable improved integration in upstream product design steps like TO and generative design . 
Integrating processing and manufacturing with design in AM is feasible since the full digital chain is there . 
In current AM practice only a few zones in a product are defined where process settings can be defined , for example for the top and bottom facing surfaces and the bulk of the product in L-PBF . 
If machine learning and closed loop control can be used to define the optimal settings for each deposition area , the need for support structures as well as the effects of thermal stresses and deformations are expected to reduce/diminish . 
This will have large impact on the AM products and the way they are designed . 
A combination of computational and knowledge-based methods would be an optimal solution for DfAM in the future to define qualified AM design solutions . 
Data analytic methods could be used to explore and discover knowledge from existing validated designs or dig out implicit knowledge from large industrial practice and experimental data sets . 
A collaborative cloud-based DfAM platform would be more sustainable for the world if people could share their designs and design knowledge as well as other AM processing related data sets . 
This would enable and advance wide KBE in DfAM , save a lot of cost and time and improve quality over the trial and error practice in current DfAM . 
This will result in new application areas , new process constraints and new AM features The main goal of this review is to provide a detailed and comprehensive description of the published work from the past decade regarding AM of ceramic materials with possible applications in dentistry . 
The main printable materials and most common technologies are also addressed , underlining their advantages and main drawbacks . 
Methods Online databases were consulted on this topic . 
Results Ceramic materials are broadly used in dentistry to restore/replace damaged or missing teeth , due to their biocompatibility , chemical stability and mechanical and aesthetic properties . 
Due to their brittleness nature , a very tight control of the manufacturing process is needed to obtain dental pieces with adequate mechanical properties . 
Additive manufacturing is an emerging technology that constitutes an interesting and viable manufacturing alternative to the conventional subtractive methods . 
AM enables the production of customized complex 3D parts in a more sustainable and less expensive way . 
AM of ceramics can be achieved with an extensive variety of methods . 
Although very promising , AM of ceramic dental materials remains understudied and further work is required to make it a widespread technology in dentistry . 
In dentistry , as in many other fields , the production of dental pieces is increasingly becoming automated . 
Computer aided design and/or computer aided manufacturing have become progressively widespread within the medical and dental fields . 
These tools are generally used in the manufacture of dental pieces in machining centers , where extra material is removed from a block to obtain the piece with the desired shape . 
This technique is known as subtractive manufacturing . 
Nowadays , a new type of technology is emerging , additive manufacturing , also referred to as 3D printing , that allow building up pieces by adding materials layer-by-layer , based on a computerized 3D model . 
This type of technology has suffered great developments in a wide range of areas , allowing to produce pieces of all classes of materials , including materials of biological origin . 
AM focus has been moving from prototype fabrication to rapid manufacturing of small or medium quantities of end-use products . 
Among the main areas of AM application stands out : - Aerospace : AM technology is particularly suitable to obtain a limited number of pieces that are usually required for aerospace applications , with complex geometries and made of advanced materials which are difficult , costly and time-consuming to manufacture . 
- Automotive : AM technology is an important tool in this industry , since it can reduce the development cycle , manufacturing and product costs of automotive components . 
It allows producing small quantities of structural and functional parts and thus , is particularly interesting for racing vehicles , where light-weight alloys and composites are used to obtain highly complex structures . 
- Energy : AM technology allows the fast development and fabrication of prototypes to reduce the cost and lead-time of research and development of new solutions that reduce the fossil energy dependency . 
It increases the design possibilities to improve energy efficiency and/or power density , in alternatives that use renewable and clean energies . 
- Biomedical : Recent developments in the biomaterials field , biologic sciences and biomedicine have potentiated the use of AM techniques . 
Customization is a critical factor in this area and AM allows the production of a wide range of products with specific properties and shapes that meet the patient needs . 
For example , it is possible to produce diagnostic platforms , orthopedic and dental implants , drug delivery systems , medical devices , tissue scaffolds and artificial organs . 
Biofabrication through AM emerged in the recent years as a new alternative to fabricate tissues . 
Here , living cells are deposited layer-by-layer in combination with different biomaterials to obtain complex living structures . 
In the dentistry field , the use of AM to produce endurable dental structures is expected to bring advantages over conventional manufacturing methods , as reported on other fields . 
In particular , it shall : - Allow the production of customized near-net-shape dental pieces with intricate details . 
Product complexity shall not add cost to production beyond the design stage , because once the design is set , costs are independent of the shape . 
- Allow reduction of dental parts production time and consequently of time-to-market . 
Traditional subtractive technologies involve several time-consuming steps , while AM allows a faster direct production starting simply from a 3D scan of the oral cavity . 
- Limit human error relevance in the procedures . 
Minor human intervention is required in AM due to the lower number of manufacturing steps . 
- Decrease the environmental impact , ensuring a higher manufacturing sustainability . 
Being an additive technique , it reduces material waste and energy consumption and eliminates the use of conventional manufacturing tools . 
Globally , AM allows moving from mass production to mass customization , with significant efficiency increase and production costs decrease . 
The expected dissemination of this technology applied to dental prosthesis shall result in equipmentcost decrease . 
Thus , the reduction of final product price is predictable , increasing the accessibility of dental care to the poorest sectors of the population . 
Due to the recent expiration of the main 3D printing patents , the access to printers became easier and less expensive . 
Digital dentistry is reported to be one of the fastest growing sectors of the AM technologies . 
There are several possible applications of AM techniques in dentistry , e.g . 
crowns , bridges , dentures , models , surgical guides , implants and orthodontics materials . 
Several challenges emerge when this technique is considered to produce endurable dental devices . 
For example , the reliability of the process , surface finishing of the samples and materials density are among the major concerns . 
Concerning dental materials that can be used in AM , polymers are the most studied and used ones , followed by metals . 
AM of ceramic dental materials is still underdeveloped , mainly due to the difficulties to produce pieces with suitable surface finishing , mechanical properties and dimensional accuracy . 
The available literature regarding AM of ceramic materials represents less than 5 % of the total AM published related work . 
The studies are even fewer in what concerns ceramic materials for dental applications . 
This paper presents a recent overview of published work concerning AM of ceramic materials for dental applications . 
A summary of potentially printable dental biomaterials and brief descriptions of the most common digital manufacturing technologies are also provided , highlighting the main features , advantages and drawbacks , to better understand the potential and restrictions of each technology . 
The used keywords strings were : 3D printing AND Dental ; Additive manufacturing AND Dental . 
Additive manufacturing of bioceramics for dental applicationsbut included in the remaining sections to complement this review and provide any additional remarks . 
3 Ceramic dental materials Bioceramics are broadly used in the dental field . 
These materials have some attractive features/attributes which are similar to natural dentition properties , e.g . 
compressive strength , thermal conductivity , radiopacity , colour stability , aesthetics . 
However , these materials are brittle , hard and sometimes difficult to process . 
Bioceramics can be divided in 4 categories , depending on their main system composition : glass-based systems ; glass-based systems with fillers , usually crystalline ; crystalline-based systems with glass fillers ; polycrystalline solids . 
Glass-based systems consist of materials that are made mostly of silicon dioxide and can comprise different amounts of alumina . 
Feldspars are composed of aluminosilicates , found in nature , containing different quantities of potassium and sodium . 
Feldspars can be modified in several ways in order to produce the glass used in the dental area . 
Additionally , synthetic forms of alumina silicate glasses may as well be manufactured for dental ceramics . 
The glass composition is almost the same as the pure glass category , being that the difference resides in the amount of different types of crystals that can either be added or grown in the glassy matrix . 
Nowadays , the primary crystal types are leucite , lithium dissilicate or fluoroapatite . 
Intended as an alternative to traditional metal ceramics , crystalline-based systems with glass fillers were developed . 
They are composed of glass-infiltrated , partially sintered alumina . 
Polycrystaline solids are made by directly sintering crystals together , forming a dense , air-free , glass-free , polycrystalline structure . 
In the next sections , a brief description is presented regarding the main properties of the most frequently used bioceramics in dental applications . 
3.1 Zirconia Zirconia ceramics were introduced in dentistry in the early nineties , as endosseous implants in dental prosthetic surgery . 
This material is known to have exceptional mechanical properties and ease of machining in the pre-sintering stage through CAD/CAM . 
Zirconia is biocompatible with the tissues in the oral cavity and has been reported to be osteoconductive , which means that this ceramic facilitates bone formation when in contact with it . 
Regarding mechanical properties , zirconia ceramics are considered to have high strength , hardness , wear resistance , resistance to corrosion , modulus of elasticity similar to steel , coefficient of thermal expansion similar to iron , and the highest fracture toughness among the most used ceramics . 
Zirconia-based ceramics can be stabilized in tetragonal or cubic phases depending on the used dopant , its concentration and temperature during the thermal treatments . 
For dental applications , zirconia is commonly stabilized with 3 mol % yttria . 
The excellent mechanical properties of stabilized tetragonal zirconia are related with the stress-induced from tetragonal to monoclinical transformation , which is accompanied by a 4.5 % volume increase . 
This behaviour leads to the development of compression zone , shielding the propagating crack tip which inhibits further crack propagation , successfully enhancing toughness . 
Nevertheless , there are some disadvantageous aspects of zirconia ceramics . 
3.2 Alumina Alumina , also called aluminum oxide , was first introduced in the 1970s . 
However , the initial applications presented a fracture rate of the order of 13 % . 
This observed failure was related to a higher porosity . 
With further developments , a decade later , a second improved generation of alumina ceramics was presented , characterized by higher density and smaller grains . 
This led to a decrease of the fracture rate to less than 5 % . 
Nowadays , there is available a third generation of alumina ceramic components , with properties such as high purity , high density and finer microstructure . 
Alumina is used in dental applications for fabrication of endodontic posts , orthodontic brackets , dental implants , crowns and bridges and in ceramic abutments . 
High purity alumina has usually a purity of 99.99 % and has been developed as an alternative to surgical metal alloys for dental applications . 
According to US Food and Drug Administration , only the high-purity Al2O3 can be used for medical grade ceramics . 
Impurities such as SiO2 , metal silicates and alkali metal oxides that form glassy grain boundary phases must be minimized to less than 0.1 wt % , since the in vivo degradation of such glassy phases leads to the appearance of stress concentration sites where cracks can be initiated , leading to the catastrophic failure of the component . 
It is possible to enhance alumina toughness and fracture strength by controlling the grain size and the porosity . 
This can be achieved using adequate sintering cycles , and adding some additives , zirconium oxide and chromium oxide ) . 
3.3 Leucite Leucite is a potassium alumina-silicate . 
This material displays a tetragonal structure at room temperature . 
At 625 it suffers a displacive phase transformation from tetragonal to cubic , together with a volume expansion of 1.2 % . 
Leucite has been widely used as a constituent of dental ceramics to modify the coefficient of thermal expansion , which is very important when the ceramic is to be fused or baked onto metal . 
Usually leucite-based materials are used for veneering ceramics in metal-ceramic restorations , also referred to as feldspathic porcelains . 
Leucite is attained by incongruent melting of feldspar at temperatures between 1150 and 1530 . 
Despite the mechanical properties of feldspathic porcelains being the weakest within ceramic dental materials , their global performance is perceived as quite successful . 
3.4 Lithium dissilicate Lithium silicate-based glass-ceramics were recently introduced as machinable materials to respond to the demanded increased strength , toughness and wear resistance , required for the fabrication of dental pieces . 
This ceramic material is used in the fabrication of single and multiunit dental restorations , mainly dental crowns , bridges , and veneers , due to its excellent mechanical and optical properties . 
In general , lithium disilicate presents a microstructure constituted by interlocking needle-like crystals embedded in a glass matrix . 
As a result of this morphology , cracks are forced to propagate around each individual lithium disilicate crystal . 
This type of microstructure increases both strength and toughness relatively to other commonly used glass-ceramics : they have a strength twice as higher as that of the first generation of leucite-reinforced ceramics . 
3.5 Mica Mica minerals are a group of sheet silicate minerals , or layer type silicates , that consist of varying complex formulae of Si , K , Na , Ca , F , O , Fe and Al . 
The mechanical properties are dictated by the specific crystal structure formed by the cleavage planes situated along the layers . 
Crack propagation is more likely to occur along the cleavage planes . 
Mica-based glass-ceramics are relevant for dental materials due to their good machinability , high strength and resistivity to thermal expansion as well as biocompatibility . 
3.6 Others ceramic dental materials Besides the examples mentioned above , there are other ceramic materials used in the dentistry field . 
For over 30 years , calcium phosphate-based formulations are recognized by their good osteoconductivity and biocompatibility in reconstructive surgeries . 
Tricalcium phosphate presents three polymorphs . 
These include : monoclinic , and hexagonal and rhombohedral form . 
Hydroxyapatite 62 ) is the main component of enamel , and is responsible for the bright white appearance and elimination of the diffuse reflectivity of light by closing the small pores of the enamel surface . 
HA can be used as filler in the repair of craniofacial defects or small holes and depressions on enamel surface , as grafting material and as coating in implant dentistry . 
Bioactive glasses are silicate-based materials that can form a strong chemical bond with the tissues . 
They present great interest in regeneration and healing of bone tissue . 
Their ability to support osteoblast cells , to bond to both soft and hard tissue and their capability of stimulating angiogenesis in the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor make them an attractive alternative relatively to other scaffold materials . 
Finally , dental impression materials still play a significant role in dentistry . 
Gypsum products are among the most frequently used materials by dental professionals , since its properties are easily modified by physical and chemical means . 
Gypsum may be used as impression material , mold material for processing complete dentures , as binders for silica in gold alloy casting investment , soldering investment , and investment for low-melting-point nickel-chromium alloys . 
3.7 Composites A composite material is defined as a combination of two or more materials . 
The resulting combination renders unique properties with characteristics different from the individual components . 
In dentistry , ceramic composites may comprise combinations such as ceramic-metal , ceramic-polymer , or ceramic-ceramic Examples of current dental ceramic-ceramic composites include aluminacomposites , commercially available as structural ceramics for dental devices . 
These materials , contain either alumina-toughened zirconia or zirconia-toughened alumina , depending on the percentage of the main component . 
These composites combine the transformation toughening capabilities of zirconia along with the lower susceptibility to low temperature degradation in biological fluids . 
More recently , with the development of nanotechnology , the bionanocomposites have emerged . 
These materials are expected to mimic native tissue structure , withstand high biting force and harsh oral cavity environment , e.g . 
sudden change of temperature or osmotic pressure and invasion of various pathogens . 
Possible applications for bionanocomposites in the dental field include dental tissue regeneration or its substitution . 
4 Digital manufacturing CAD/CAM production of fixed prosthetic restorations such as inlays , onlays , veneers , crowns , and fixed partial dentures is a relatively well established technology used by dental health professionals for over 20 years . 
All CAD/CAM systems involve three steps . 
The first one corresponds to the data acquisition , through various scanning technologies that allow to transform the site/product geometry into digital data to be processed by the computer . 
This is followed by manipulation and processing of the data set using a CAD software . 
Finally , the processed data are used for manufacturing of structures in the desired material through CAM . 
In dentistry , there are three different production concepts available , depending on the location of the steps of the CAD/CAM processes : - chairside production , - laboratory production , - centralized fabrication in a production center . 
The production can be carried out through several different technologies , that can be divided into two manufacturing processes : subtractive and additive manufacturing . 
4.1 Subtractive manufacturing There are several subtractive manufacturing techniques . 
The most used in dental ceramics processing is based on milling of pre-sintered or fully sintered blocks , through a computer numeric controlled machine . 
The CAM software automatically translates the CAD model into tool path for the CNC machine . 
This involves computation of the commands series that dictate the CNC milling , including sequencing , milling tools , and tool motion direction and magnitude . 
The accuracy of tool positioning has been reported to be within 10 . 
The 3-axis milling systems are the most commonly used in dental milling systems . 
In such systems , the milling burs move in three axes according to a defined path . 
SM is extensively used in dentistry for the production of dental pieces such as crowns and bridges . 
SM technology allows the processing of materials , which would otherwise be difficult to manipulate . 
This way , the exhaustive artisanal production techniques are decreased or even eliminated , thus allowing the dental technician to enhance the creative component of his manual manufacturing process . 
SM is a well-established technology which has the advantage of using intrinsically homogeneous materials which are unaffected by operating conditions . 
Furthermore , it requires low post-processing and the costs regarding the involved equipment are relatively reduced . 
However , this is a wasteful process because the piece is milled from an intact block with a significant loss of material amount . 
Factors such as the objectscomplexity , the dimension of the tooling equipment and the properties of the material can affect and limit the accuracy of this process . 
4.2 Additive manufacturing Additive manufacturing , also referred to as solid freeform fabrication , rapid prototyping or 3D printing , involves processing methodologies that are capable of producing structures by depositing materials layer-by-layer resorting to a computer generated design file . 
The workpiece is virtually sliced into several two-dimensional layers . 
Then , an AM machine generates the tool-path along the x and y directions . 
Each material layer is deposited one on top of the other , consecutively , forming a three-dimensional part . 
Ceramics present a higher melting point , higher susceptibility to thermal shook and lower sintrerability than the other group of materials . 
Thus , it is quite difficult to obtained fully consolidated parts , without defects , using AM methods that produced directly sintered bodies . 
In most of the cases , AM is used to obtain preliminary 3D structures in green that are built from mixture powders with organic or inorganic binder materials and need to be submitted to further steps of debinding and sintering . 
Some authors refer to these methods as indirect , contrarily to direct methods where the ceramic powder is sintered during the manufacturing procedure . 
The debinding step depends on the organic components and became diffusion limited by increasing the thickness of the part , leading to higher debinding times The debinding temperature need to be carefully chosen . 
If is to high the removal rate of the volatile products resulting from the binder decomposition is too high , the pressure may increase and lead to crack formation and/or delamination . 
A possible solution to overcome the internal stresses generated during debinding may be the use of plasticizing agents . 
The defects can also be avoided through the introduction of open spaces in the structure . 
That can be achieved by adding compounds able to evaporate/decompose at lower temperature than the debinding process temperature 2 . 
There are several applications for AM in dentistry . 
One of the earliest is medical modelling , for surgery guide , where anatomical modelsare created . 
The models can also be used as supports for the fabrication of restorations , for example , to help in the addition of veneered materials . 
In digital orthodontics , there are systems available that digitally realign the patientteeth to make a series of 3D printed models for the manufacture of aligners . 
3D printing technology can also be used to produce novel titanium dental implants with a porous or rough surface and different types of restorations/components in metallic or polymeric materials . 
In the next sections , the main AM technologies available , referred in 1 , are described , namely indirect methods , such as binder jetting , material extrusion and jetting and Vat polymerization/stereolitography , and direct methods , which include direct energy deposition and powder bed fusion . 
4.2.1 Binder jetting Binder jetting uses two materials , a powder-based material and a binder . 
Usually in the liquid form , the organic binder acts as an adhesive between ceramic powder particles . 
A print head deposits alternated layers of the building material and the binding material , moving horizontally along the x and y axes of the machine . 
After each layer , the build platform is lowered and the process repeated over the previous layer . 
BJ presents several advantages , such as the ability to use a range of materials as well as a large number of combinations powder/binder , being generally a fast printing process . 
The drawbacks of this technology are mainly related to the high porosity and consequent low mechanical properties of the printed pieces . 
This is due to factors such as the high friction within the powder particles , their random agglomeration and the absence of an external force to compress the powder and improve packaging . 
The flowability and spreadability of powders are especially important for BJ . 
Using powders with large particle sizes can enhance the flowability , however it may jeopardize the sinterability and densification behaviour after printing . 
Contrarily , very fine particle size may lead to considerable agglomeration and reduced flowability . 
Since after sintering , the pieces density rarely exceeds 50 % of the theoretical value , this technology seems not to be suitable for structural parts . 
In order to overcome this issue , the printed piece may be infiltered under vacuum with a glass material that penetrates in the pores by capillary effect . 
4.2.2 Material extrusion and jetting Generally , in the material extrusion process the material is heated and extruded through a nozzle . 
The nozzle can move horizontally , and the build platform can move vertically to enable the addition of each subsequent layer . 
This process , also known as fused deposition modeling , is the most widespread and inexpensive process within 3D printing technology . 
However , there are some drawbacks such as not being as fast as other AM processes and presenting an accuracy limited by the nozzle radius , which reduces the final product quality . 
In order to increase the final quality it is necessary to control factors such as extrusion speed and ensure constant pressure and flow . 
Another form of AM using material extrusion is material jetting process , where the material is deposited in the form of droplets , instead of filament , to form a 2D pattern . 
The printed layer is cured using ultraviolet radiation , immediately after the deposition . 
The process is repeated until the complete 3D part is formed . 
5 shows an example of an occlusal surface of a dental crown produced by this technique from a ceramic suspension of yttria partially stabilized zirconia . 
It is possible to observe surface waviness associated with layer-by-layer deposition . 
Material extrusion techniques also include robocasting . 
In this process , a filament of a paste is extruded through a nozzle while it moves over a platform , building the object layer-by-layer . 
The paste exits the nozzle with a given shape , without being necessary waiting for its solidification or drying to build the next layer . 
Freeze-form Extrusion Fabrication is another example of extrusion-based AM technology . 
Contrarily to most of the other extrusion freeform fabrication methods , in FEF , the organic binder content is only 2vol % and the solids loading of the paste can be higher than 50 vol % . 
During FEF the piece is built by keeping the surrounding environment of the building platform below the freezing temperature of water . 
This solidifies the paste after the deposition on each layer during the fabrication process . 
FEF enables the production of relatively large parts , when compared with traditional robocasting . 
In extrusion techniques , the mechanical properties can be improved by controlling the crystallographic texture of the materials . 
This may be achieved by mixing a small number of large particles of anisotropic shape with fine particles . 
During extrusion , the anisotropic particles align in the shear direction . 
In a later sintering step , the aligned particles grow absorbing the fine particles , leading to highly textured and dense ceramics . 
4.2.3 Vat polymerization/stereolitography Vat polymerization/stereolitography was created by Chuck Hull in 1986 and was the AM technology pioneer . 
SLA was the first AM to be applied in medicine , which was used to produce surgical models for alloplastic implant surgery in 1994 . 
In vat polymerization printing , a specific type of light is used to build parts one layer at a time , in a vat containing light-cured photopolymer resin mixed with ceramic powder . 
The light travels each layer through the surface of the liquid resin . 
Then , the building platform descends allowing that another layer of resin spreads over the surface , and thus repeating the process . 
This technology enables a rapid fabrication and allows to create complex shapes with high level of accuracy and good finish . 
The curing depth is a critical parameter that determines the accuracy of the formability . 
6 shows a zirconia implant printed trough this method . 
When compared to conventional polymer-based SLA , using ceramics can affect the line width and the curing depth . 
Also , since conventional SLA equipment uses dispersions with viscosities lower than 5 Pa.s , the particle size and the solids volume fraction of the ceramics preparations must be adjusted to meet the requirements of both formability and sinterability . 
To obtain ceramics with a high density , it is essential a fine particle size and a high solids volume fraction . 
Overall , SLA presents excellent surface finishing , but is still considered to be relatively expensive and present a lengthily post-processing time for unprocessed resin removal and additional curing . 
For ceramics , a final thermal cycle allows to remove the organic resin and sintering the material , increasing its density . 
4.2.4 Direct energy deposition techniques Direct energy deposition is a more complex additive printing process , commonly used to repair or add additional material to existing components . 
A typical DED machine consists of a nozzle mounted on a multi axis arm , which deposits melted material onto the specified surface , where it solidifies . 
The material is heated and melted using a laser , electron beam or plasma arc . 
The piece is lowered by a distance equivalent to the layer thickness . 
Although this process typically uses metal , it can also use polymers and ceramics , either provided in wire or powder form . 
For ceramic materials , it allows achieving almost 100 % density and avoids shrinkage or distortion , eliminating the need of debinding or sintering steps . 
Wilkes and Wissenbach were pioneer in studying the applicability of this method to manufacture ceramic components for medical applications . 
4.2.5 Powder bed fusion Powder-based printing technologies include selective laser sintering , direct metal laser sintering , selective laser melting and electron beam melting . 
All these technologies use heat to fuse the powdered materials . 
The differences rely on the energy source and powder materials . 
For instance , SLS , DMLS , and SLM all use lasers , while EBM uses electron beam as energy source In the sintering processes , the powders are not completely melted . 
This leads to porous internal structures and rough surfaces . 
In the melting processes , the powders are well fused , creating parts with enhanced mechanical properties and higher densities . 
The process begins with the spreading of a layer of material over the build platform , typically 0.1 mm thick . 
The energy source fuses the first layer or first cross section of the model . 
The build platform is then lowered and a new layer of powder is spread across the previous using a roller . 
7 shows a dental piece made of alumina-zirconia composite obtained by this process . 
The manufacturing time for powder bed fusion based techniques is lower than for other AM techniques . 
In fact , as it happens with direct energy deposition , since these techniques do not involve the use of binders for the production of intermediate green pieces , it is not required any debinding process . 
However , due to the high heating and cooling rates , thermal shock may occur , which may lead to cracking . 
This may be avoided by pre-heating the powder . 
5 Additive manufacturing of bioceramics for dental applications Ceramic materials where only recently considered in AM processing due to their intrinsic properties . 
The high melting points of ceramics make them difficult to melt under normal heating methods . 
Although it is possible to melt some ceramics , this process can cause new phase formation . 
On the other hand , several factors associated to the processing of the ceramic materials and to the characteristics of the raw materials used may affect the porosity of the final piece . 
An increase of porosity impairs the mechanical properties of the final product . 
However , it can be favourable for cellular growth or implant fixation , required for specific applications . 
This section will report published work where different bioceramics , such as zirconia , alumina , calcium phosphates and ceramic composites , with possible applications in dentistry , are processed using various AM technologies . 
5.1 Additive manufacturing of zirconia The information concerning the AM of zirconia-based compositions , with possible applications in dentistry is present in 2 . 
Ebert demonstrated the possibility to build dense three-dimensional components of the size of a crown , with its characteristic occlusal surface topography , through material extrusion technology , using zirconia ceramic suspensions . 
The printed and sintered samples were not completely free of process-related defects , mainly due to clogged nozzles during printing . 
However , it was possible to obtain specimens with relative density of 96.9 % , with mechanical properties comparable to those of conventionally produced 3Y-TZP via cold isostatic pressing . 
Moin , established that it is feasible to use high-end digital light processing technology to fabricate a root analogue implant with a certain amount of precision . 
However , the results showed a printed RAI with a 6.67 % larger surface area . 
A large number of factors are recognized to influence the precision of this printing technique , namely the resolution of the digital mirroring device and the composition of the ceramic/ photopolymer mixture . 
The authors claim that the precise control over spatially grade composition , microstructure design/distribution and shape are potential advantages over milling of unsintered ceramics . 
Osman also used a SLA method to efficiently print customized zirconia dental implants with sufficient dimensional accuracy . 
The study evaluated among other aspects , the dimensional accuracy , surface topography and mechanical properties . 
The authors report that the dimensional accuracy of the printed implant was high and the achieved mechanical properties showed flexural strength close to those of conventionally produced ceramics . 
SLA was again used by Xing , to produce ZrO2 complex shaped ceramic components with high dimensional accuracy and proper properties . 
The surface roughness of the unpolished ZrO2 showed an anisotropic behavior with values ranging from 0.41 to 1.07 on the measuring direction . 
This phenomenon could be eliminated through polishing , reducing Ra to a nanometer scale . 
The sintered ceramics had isotropic mechanical properties close to milled zirconia due to the homogeneity of the grain size . 
In the work of Scheithauer , the droplet formation behavior of zirconia suspensions for thermoplastic 3D printing was investigated . 
The precise deposition of small adjacent droplets of molten thermoplastic suspensions containing ceramic particles allowed to obtain filament-like structures by coalescence of adjacent droplets . 
The researchers introduced the droplet fusion factor in order to calculate the necessary distance between two droplets to produce those filaments . 
The results showed that filament-like structures with a smooth surface and a nearly homogeneous cross section could be produced for suspensions with a dff of 44 % or higher . 
In a previous work , the same research group used the same process to print zirconia samples . 
They were able to produce ceramic parts with high density and homogeneous microstructures . 
On one hand the heating rates required for thermal debinding are very low and it must be carried out in a powder bed , increasing the time and complexity of the process . 
In another work of the same group , the authors combined AM and functionally graded materials to create zirconia-based customizable smart materials . 
By using T3DP technology , it was possible to selectively deposit two different materials beside each other , offering the prospect of combining suspensions with different contents of a pore forming agents to obtained components with dense and porous areas inside . 
The presence of zones with different porosities reduces the elastic modulus , diminishing the stress shielding , which should be benefic for dental implants . 
More , the presence of open pores shall favor the osteointegration . 
The work of Shao , showed the possibility of successfully printing ZrO2 ceramic parts by a new extrusion-based process , 3D Gel-Printing . 
The authors were able to produce printed and sintered cuboid samples with a regular appearance . 
Parameters such as surface roughness , relative density , hardness and transverse rupture strength of printed and sintered samples were compared with those obtained in other 3D printing processes . 
It was found that 3DGP led to samples with higher density , hardness and surface finishing than those obtained by syringe extrusion , and that presented higher transverse rupture strength than others produced by gel casting . 
More , no defects or deformation was observed from outside of the printed samples . 
The authors refer the importance of aspects such as printing conditions , rheological behavior of the slurry as well as the solid loading on the final properties of the printed/sintered samples . 
Faes combined the advantages of AM extrusion and UV curing into a single 3D printing technique , to obtain pieces with an high shape stability and green strength . 
This novel syringe-based AM process , based on the use of a photopolymerizable dispersion , leads to economic benefits since it reduces the raw material consumption . 
High shrinkage was observed during sintering , leading to cracking . 
This must be due to a low load of ceramic particles in the dispersion . 
It is suggested to increase the amount of ceramic particles , keeping the rheological behavior , which can be achieved through the introduction of steric repulsive forces in the dispersion , for example using other resins . 
5.2 Additive manufacturing of alumina 3 gathers the main findings of published work regarding the AM of alumina-based formulations with possible applications in the dental field . 
Work carried out by Scheithauer , showed the possibility of printing dense alumina pieces using 3D printing of high-filled suspensions with thermoplastic binder systems . 
The authors achieved samples with high densities , homogeneous microstructures and very good bonding between the printed layers . 
This study also highlights the importance of the rheological properties of the slurries , i.e . 
low viscosity allows an easy flow through the needle to form small droplets , which can improve the printing resolution . 
It is concluded that thermoplastic 3D printing presents several advantages over other suspension-based technologies , namely the fact that the green layer solidifying occur by simple cooling , the versatility of ceramic materials that can be used and the applicability in limited areas . 
It is recognized the potential of the technique to print multimaterial and multifunctional components , as well as to obtain pieces with material and/or property gradients in different dimensions . 
However , the authors claim that heating rates for thermal debinding must be very low and that the process must be performed in a powder bed . 
Dehurtevent , presented a study which provides promising results for manufacturing dense 3D alumina crown frameworks by SLA . 
The authors established a comparison between the physical and mechanical properties of SLA-manufactured alumina ceramics of different compositions and viscosity to those of subtractive-manufactured ceramics . 
Their results showed an acceptability window for viscosity of the slurries that allows producing SLA manufactured alumina pieces . 
Additionally , the authors were able to achieve a composition that originated a reliable material with the anisotropic shrinkage , high density , flexural strength , and Weibull characteristics suitable for SLA manufacturing . 
Nevertheless , it was observed that although an oversize of 35 % allow manufacturing complex morphologies , differential shrinkage led to deformation of the final structure . 
In the work of Maleksaeedi , a powder-bed inkjet 3D-printing and vacuum infiltration process was used for producing alumina parts with high density and improved mechanical properties . 
The authors utilized vacuum infiltration process to enhance the packing of the green parts after printing , by impregnating the 3D-printed parts with highly solid loaded slurries . 
Their results showed that the vacuum infiltration process was able to significantly increase the density , reduce the porosity and increase the strength of the 3D-printed alumina components . 
Moreover , the bending strength was improved up to 15 times of the original strength . 
5.3 Additive manufacturing of other ceramics The potential of AM has been explored in several dental applications with other ceramic materials . 
4 summarizes information regarding various calcium phosphates compositions and other bioceramics , as well as gypsum , mainly for bone regeneration . 
Lopez , produced bioactive tricalcium phosphate scaffolds using a material extrusion technology , robocasting . 
The printed scaffolds were able to restore critical mandibular segmental defects to levels similar to native bone after a 8 week period implant in an adult rabbit mandibular defect model . 
Histological and scanning electron microscopy analysis showed directional bony ingrowth into the scaffold interstices , tracking healing pathway origins to defect walls and marrow spaces . 
More , it was observed new bone growth and scaffold resorption at bone/scaffold interfaces . 
Another work using robocasting technology is the one carried out by Slots in which porous TCP implants were developed using storable and reusable inks composed of fatty acid/TCP . 
The total fabrication time including ink preparation , printing and sintering was less than 5 h for 8 cm2 of implant . 
The printed implants were able to retain their shape after sintering and were chemically unchanged by the printing and sintering process . 
Mesenchymal stem cells were able to grow on the implants , secrete collagen and alkaline phosphate and mineralize the implant . 
Additionally , they possessed clinically relevant mechanical strength and presented osteoconductive properties . 
The process demonstrated to be sufficiently simple and effective to enable rapid , on-demand , in-hospital production of patient-specific ceramic implants for treatment of bone trauma . 
In the study conducted by Fahimipour , a biomimetic porous TCP/alginate/gelatin scaffold containing PLGA ) microspheres for slow release of VEGF was processed through extrusion technology . 
The printable ink was selected according to the gel point of different formulations of TCP/alginate/gelatin . 
The process faced some difficulties , for example in what concerns the needle blocking during extrusion if the gel point is above room temperature . 
Nevertheless , it was possible to achieve satisfactory mechanical and biological features supporting cell viability necessary for bone tissue regeneration.Tamimi , prepared customized 3D-printed monetite onlays by binder jetting . 
The onlays were design to facilitate the diffusion of cells and nutrients from high bone metabolic to low bone metabolic areas . 
The research showed that bone metabolic activity in onlays is anatomy-dependant and correlates with the ability of bone augmentation . 
The authors were able to achieve osseointegration of dental implants in bone augmented with the printed monetite onlays . 
Klammert also used binder jetting technology to produce several specific craniofacial implants of TCP . 
The printed parts were able to comply with geometric requirements and provide an adequate accuracy of fit , even though the authors did not use a commercial CAD solution . 
Fieldint and colleagues face several challenges to adapt and optimize the processing parameters to produce scaffolds using a 3D binder jetting printer and commercially available binders . 
The authors report that the addition of dopants to the ceramic powder decreased the to phase transformation of TCP sintered at 1250 Additionally , the density increased leading to a 250 % increase in compressive strength , when compared to pure TCP scaffolds . 
Shao prepared by extrusion , four groups of bioceramic scaffolds for treatment of bone defects : Mg-substituted wollastonite-based ; TCP-based ; wollastonite-based ; and bredigite-based . 
Additionally , CSi-Mg10 printed parts revealed the largest pore dimension but the lowest porosity , mainly due to the considerable shrinkage of the scaffolds during sintering . 
Asadi-Eydivand , prepared gypsum-based scaffolds also for the treatment of bone defects . 
They investigated the effect of thermic treatment on the structural , mechanical , and physical properties of samples produced by extrusion/jetting . 
For the lowest temperature , the samples showed adequate mechanical properties , but high cytotoxicity . 
In contrast , temperatures in the range of 500 led to lower cytotoxic scaffolds but insufficient mechanical strength . 
For temperatures higher than 1000 higher compressive strength and greater viability were observed . 
However , above 1200 decomposition of calcium sulfate occurs , leading to mass loss . 
5.4 Additive manufacturing of ceramic composites 5 gathers the information about AM of ceramic-based composites possible applications in dentistry . 
In the work carried out by Goyos-Ball porous robocasted structures made of 10 mol % ceria-stabilized zirconia and alumina composite were produced . 
The authors found that round lattice structures have compression strength similar to cortical bone , are not cytotoxic and induce osseous differentiation . 
More , the printed parts showed good aesthetics , chemical stability and negligible corrosion and wear . 
Due to the high structural integrity , the printed parts could be used as scaffolds for load bearing applications during the osteointegration process . 
Rahim established a comparison between composites prepared by extrusion and by injection moulding . 
The samples were composed of polyamide 12 , incorporated with bioceramic fillers , from 10 to 40 % content . 
The results of their work showed that the addition of fillers improved or maintained the strength and stiffness of the parts , while reducing toughness and flexibility . 
Melting behaviour of polyamide 12 did not depend on the processing techniques , but was affected by the addition of fillers and by the cooling rate . 
Incorporation of fillers improved the thermal stability . 
It was found that fuse deposition modelling allows producing medical implants with acceptable mechanical performances for non-load bearing applications . 
Jan manufactured ceramic objects by powder bed fusion , using selective laser melting technology . 
The authors were able to produce parts with good mechanical properties , with approximately 100 % density , without needing sintering processes or post-processing , which constitutes an advantage . 
The study reports some process challenges that need to be overcome , for instance , the thermally induced stresses , caused by the deposition of the new cold powder layers on top of the preheated ceramic , and the surface roughness values . 
6 Challenges Additive manufacturing is recognized as a promising technology with advantages not only in the production of customized healthcare products to improve population health and quality of life , but also by its possibility of decreasing environmental impact , enhancing the manufacturing sustainability . 
However , the inherent challenges of 3D printing should not be overlooked . 
Aspects such as surface quality , dimensional accuracy and the mechanical properties need improvement to allow producing effective high-quality products . 
Concerning surface quality , it depends on the AM used technique , processing conditions and raw material characteristics , which affect the thickness of each printed layer . 
Powder bed AM leads to lower surface quality than the other AM techniques , due to the presence of large and partially melted powder particles in the printed piecessurfaces . 
Relatively to the thickness of the printed layers , extrusion techniques typically lead to high layer thicknesses due to the large diameter of the deposition nozzle . 
Powder bed fusion and vat polymerization origin lower layer thicknesses due to the ability to precisely focus the energy beam radius . 
Material jetting techniques are the ones that produce the finest layer thickness due to the small jetted droplets . 
Dimensional accuracy is critical in the production of dental pieces , because these must fit tightly the needs of each patient . 
A variety of issues affects dimensional accuracy . 
The work of Lee summarizes the dimensional accuracy in different manufacturing processes . 
spreading compaction/densification of the powder within the layers , evaporation of material by laser/heat and shrinkage during solidification . 
Mechanical properties are influenced by the presence of defects : surface quality and porosity are critical factors . 
Different solutions have been proposed to reduce porosity . 
For example , choosing ceramic powders with an adequate granulometric distribution , adding dopants or a viscous liquid-forming phase , infiltrating the sintered body with vitreous materials and applying cold/hot isostatic pressure to the green body . 
Shrinkage is also a concern in AM processes since it affects significantly the pieces dimensions and may lead to cracking . 
The printing strategy needs to be optimized to prevent the impact of this phenomenon . 
Possible solutions to minimize this issue are : - Increasing the amount of ceramic particles in the pastes , while keeping the rheological behavior unchanged , which may be achieved adding steric dispersants - Adding to the mixture particles that can expand due to phase transformation or reaction during sintering - Decreasing the sintering temperature , without compromising density - Considering it in the CAD design of the parts . 
In most of the mentioned studies along this work , the ceramic materials are composed of mixtures of a sacrificial polymeric binder with ceramic particles for the production of the green product . 
This means that additional post-processing steps , such as sintering , are required to remove the binder and achieve a fully dense ceramic component . 
This is true for the majority of the AM technologies with few exceptions such as direct selective laser sintering and selective laser melting techniques , where the ceramic particles are directly sintered or melted , respectively . 
Dental ceramic pieces made by direct ink deposition still present low mechanical properties , compared to other conventional means to produce molded parts . 
Limitations of this layering technique include poor bonding adhesion between layers and the occurrence of porosity . 
The protocols should be as simple as possible , leading to slurries/inks with appropriate composition , flow consistency and behavior and specific viscoelastic properties . 
They should contain a high solid volume fraction not only to minimize shrinkage during drying and therefore resist the involved stresses , but also to increase the density of the final product . 
Another important challenge is bacteriological safety of the final products intended to be in close contact with tissues/organs . 
These structures must be able to endure strict sterilization protocols without losing their intrinsic properties . 
7 Final considerations Ceramic materials play an important role as dental materials . 
Their high chemical and mechanical resistance , as well as their aesthetic properties , make them an excellent option to replace damaged dental tissues . 
Conventional manufacturing methods to produce ceramic dental pieces are generally based on subtractive techniques . 
These lead to significant material and tool waste and present limitations in the production of parts with complex geometry . 
The rising demand for custom-tailored and patient specific dental products renders dentistry to be one of the rapidly expanding segments of additive manufacturing technologies . 
These technologies have been successfully used in many production sectors and present many advantages for processing dental structures , compared with subtracting technologies . 
These include less production steps with consequent impact in the total manufacturing time , lower consumables and raw materials consumption , and adequacy to produce very small and complex dental parts . 
It thus opens possibility to mass production of customized dental products , with evident benefit to the patients and/or healthcare systems . 
However , there are still concerns about application of AM to ceramics due to their intrinsically poor mechanical properties , the accuracy of the obtained pieces , their density and surface finishing . 
This comprehensive review shows that , dental bioceramics can be processed through AM by different techniques , e.g . 
material extrusion/jetting , vat polymerization , binder jetting , and powder bed fusion . 
The first technology is the most widely used . 
The studies confirmed that almost any shape could be produced , with different degrees of complexity . 
specific mechanical properties , different degrees of porosity and/or density , biodegradability , osteointegration and cytotoxicity . 
Despite the great potential for dental industry , the application of AM to ceramic dental materials is still under study . 
In resume , further developments of AM technology are expected to give a significant contribution to bring production costs down , improve manufactured materials properties and render the production processes more efficient and competitive . 
An interesting approach , when printing 3D complex dental ceramic structures , could be to combine the best attributes of AM technologies with conventional surface finishing methods . 
One of the critical issues in orthopaedic regenerative medicine is the design of bone scaffolds and implants that replicate the biomechanical properties of the host bones . 
Porous metals have found themselves to be suitable candidates for repairing or replacing the damaged bones since their stiffness and porosity can be adjusted on demands . 
Another advantage of porous metals lies in their open space for the in-growth of bone tissue , hence accelerating the osseointegration process . 
The fabrication of porous metals has been extensively explored over decades , however only limited controls over the internal architecture can be achieved by the conventional processes . 
Recent advances in additive manufacturing have provided unprecedented opportunities for producing complex structures to meet the increasing demands for implants with customized mechanical performance . 
At the same time , topology optimization techniques have been developed to enable the internal architecture of porous metals to be designed to achieve specified mechanical properties at will . 
Thus implants designed via the topology optimization approach and produced by additive manufacturing are of great interest . 
This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of topological design and manufacturing processes of various types of porous metals , in particular for titanium alloys , biodegradable metals and shape memory alloys . 
Bone is a complex tissue that continually undergoes dynamic biological remodelling , i.e. 
, the coupled process whereby osteoclasts resorb mature bone tissue followed by osteoblasts that generate new bone to maintain healthy homeostasis of bone . 
This unique feature of bone underpins its ability to remodel itself to repair damage . 
However , when a bone defect exceeds a critical non-healable size , external intervention is required to supplement self-healing if the defect is to be bridged . 
Despite recent advances in biomaterials and tissue engineering , repair of such a critical-sized bone defect still remains a challenge . 
The optimal choice is to use autograft . 
However , harvesting autograft tissue creates the morbidity associated with a second surgical site . 
The insufficiencies of application of autograft and allograft tissue have led to greater research efforts to identify biomimetic materials and structures that are suitable for skeletal repair without the inherent problems . 
Metals and alloys have a long history of application as bone implants . 
Among them , the use of stainless steels , cobalt based alloys , and titanium and its alloys are well established due to their good biocompatibility , satisfactory mechanical strength and superior corrosion resistance . 
However , implants made of these materials are usually much stiffer than natural bones , leading to stress shielding - a major source for bone resorption and eventual failure of such implants . 
Cortical bone has elastic moduli ranging from 3 to 30 GPa , while trabecular or cancellous bone has significantly lower elastic moduli of 0.02GPa . 
Most current implant materials have much higher moduli than those of bones , e.g. 
, Ti6Al4V has a modulus of around 110 GPa and CoCrMo alloys have a modulus of around 210 GPa . 
Therefore , to avoid stress shielding at the bone-implant interface , the equivalent Young 's modulus and yield stress have to be adjusted when using these bulk materials . 
An effective method is to introduce adjustable porosity or relative density as proposed by Gibson and Ashby for isotropic materials . 
Traditional methods for fabricating open-cell porous metals include liquid state processing , solid state processing , electro-deposition and vapour deposition . 
Although the shape and size of the pores can be adjusted by changing the parameters of these manufacturing processes , only a randomly organized porous structure can be achievable . 
However , additive manufacturing technologies can fabricate porous metals with predefined external shape and internal architecture . 
Metal-based additive manufacturing techniques , such as selective laser melting and electron beam melting , are computer controlled fabrication process based on layer-wise manufacturing principles . 
SLM and EBM are increasingly used for the fabrication of porous metals with complex architecture . 
Instead of using electron beam as the energy source in EBM , the SLM technology uses laser beam with adjustable wavelength . 
Therefore , EBM can only process conductive metals whereas SLM can process polymer or ceramics as well as metal . 
Furthermore , due to more diffuse energy , EBM process has larger minimum feature size , median powder particle size , layer thickness , resolution and surface finish . 
The robust application of MAM technologies requires extensive material , process and design knowledge , specific to each MAM technology . 
MAM system behaviour is subject to significant stochastic error and experimental uncertainties , requiring that are necessary to simplify the problem . 
Sources of error include : complex and transient heat transfer phenomena , geometric effects with poorly defined powder thermal properties . 
MAM prediction error can lead to excess melt pool temperature , resulting in undesirable microstructure , residual stress , local porosity , and surface roughness . 
Understanding the effects of design decisions on temperature related process defects is critically important to the process control . 
Comprehensive reviews of AM technologies can be found elsewhere . 
Recent successes in orthopaedic regenerative medicine have promised an exciting future of AM technology . 
The world 's first additively manufactured mandible was implanted in a patient by Dr. Jules Poukens and his team in 2012 in Belgium . 
A full lower jaw implant was coated with hydroxyapatite and implanted in an 83 year old lady . 
Skull reconstructions with AM parts have been performed successfully by using digital design and AM . 
Mertens successfully reconstructed a class III defect using AM manufactured titanium implants , which provided both midfacial support and a graft fixture . 
Jardini in Brazil designed and AM fabricated a customized implant for the surgical reconstruction of a large cranial defect . 
Typical design and application approaches of porous metallic implants normally include the design of scaffold , AM and post-processing as illustrated in 1 . 
This review aims to identify the current status and the future directions of design-oriented AM technology in producing porous metallic structures for bone tissue repair , with a particular emphasis on topological design of internal architecture of porous metals for bone implants . 
2 Structure and properties of bone 2.1 Structure of bone Bone is a natural composite containing both organic components and inorganic crystalline mineral , as illustrated in 2 . 
The structure of bone is similar to reinforced concrete that is used in the building industry . 
The function of HA crystals and collagen molecules are like the steel rod and cement to concrete : one part provides flexibility and the other provides strength and toughness . 
Type-I collagen is a triple helix of nm in diameter and nm in length . 
It is the primary organic components of bone . 
Other non-collagenous proteins include glycoproteins and bone specific proteoglycans . 
Hydroxyapatite is the inorganic component of bone and is plate-shaped of 50 25 nm in size and 1.5nm thick . 
The HA crystals are oriented in a periodic array in the fibrils , preferentially with their c axis parallel to the collagen fibrils . 
% of the dry bone . 
Bone has a hierarchical structure . 
The hierarchical levels of bone include macroscale , microscale , sub-microscale , nanoscale , and sub-nanoscale . 
The macroscale level represents the overall shape of the bone . 
Bone can be classified as compact bone , and trabecular bone . 
Compact bone is almost solid , with only spaces for osteocytes , canaliculi , blood vessels , and erosion cavities etc . 
There are large spaces in trabecular bone . 
The pores in trabecular bone are filled with bone marrow , and the porosity varies between 50 and 90 % . 
The building block of compact bone is the osteons , which are of the size ranging from 10 to 500 whereas the trabecular bone is made of a porous network of trabeculae . 
At the micron- and nano-scales , aggregated type-I collagen and HA form the collagen fibril . 
The reinforced collagen fibre is a universal building element for both compact and trabecular bones . 
2.2 Mechanical properties of bone Mechanical properties of bone vary significantly with age , anatomical site and bone quality . 
Among the various biomechanical properties of bone , elastic modulus has attracted the most research interest because of its critical importance for characterizing various bone pathologies and guiding artificial implant design . 
The elastic modulus and strength of bone are anisotropic . 
Compact bone is both stronger and stiffer when loaded longitudinally along the diaphyseal axis than the radial transverse directions . 
Trabecular bone is an anisotropic and porous composite . 
Like many biological materials , trabecular bone displays time-dependent behaviour as well as damage susceptibility during cyclic loading . 
The mechanical properties of trabecular bone depend on not only the porosity , but also the architectural arrangement of the individual trabeculae . 
The physical and mechanical properties of human bone are summarized in 1 . 
2.3 Requirements for the design of orthopaedic implants A successful porous metallic implant would restore the function of bone and promote regeneration of bone tissue at the damaged site . 
An ideal bone scaffold should possess the following characteristics : biocompatibility ; suitable surface for cell attachment , proliferation and differentiation ; highly porous with an interconnected pore network for cell ingrowth and transport of nutrients and metabolic waste ; mechanical properties to match the requirements of the surrounding tissues to reduce or eliminate stress shielding , and to meet anatomic loading requirements to avoid mechanical failure . 
Porous metals are implanted to repair bone defects of critical size and , in most cases , serve as load-bearing devices . 
Bone is usually anisotropic with different stiffness and strength in different directions , but normally there are no extremely weak directions . 
Therefore , suitable porous metals will approximate the stiffness of surrounding bones , making them effective for load transfer and alleviating the stress shielding effect . 
The key characteristics to design porous metallic implants include the careful selection of porosity , pore size , and pore interconnectivity , aiming to achieve satisfactory clinical outcomes . 
These structural features have a profound effect on mechanical properties and biological performance of the metallic implants . 
Bone regeneration in porous implants in vivo involves recruitment and penetration of cells from the surrounding bone tissue and vascularization . 
Higher porosity may facilitate these processes and benefit the bone ingrowth . 
For instance , more bone ingrowth was found in porous titanium coatings of higher porosity after the implants were placed into a canine model for 8 weeks . 
Similarly , bone ingrowth was shown to be deeper and greater in porous polymer scaffolds of higher porosity . 
The influence of pore size on the bone ingrowth is still controversial in literature . 
The optimal pore size for mineralized bone ingrowth is claimed to be 100in the research by Itala . 
They implanted triangle-shaped titanium implants of different plate thickness with pore size ranging from 50 to 125 into rabbit femur and found that there was no clear lower limit of pore size for consistent bone ingrowth . 
Recently Braem assessed the feasibility of early bone ingrowth into a predominantly microporous Ti coating in the compact bone of rabbit tibiae and found that new bone formed in micropores of less than 10 Large pores are believed to favour vascularization . 
Bai suggested an upper limit of pore size for vascularization , 400 beyond which no significant difference was observed with increasing pore size . 
Kuboki found that , when the pore size ranged from 300 to 400 the implantation of porous hydroxyapatite scaffolds into rats showed higher alkaline phosphates activity , osteocalcin content and bone ingrowth . 
However , Naoya implanted 300 600 and 900 AM manufactured porous Ti scaffolds into rabbit tibia and they found 600 and 900 scaffolds demonstrated significantly higher bone ingrowth than 300 scaffolds . 
In addition to vascularization , specific surface area of scaffolds is another essential factor with respect to fixation ability . 
Scaffolds with smaller pores are considered to have larger surface area and therefore more space for bone tissue ingrowth . 
Another important feature of bone implants is the permeability of the porous metal since the transportation of cells , nutrients and growth factors require the flow of blood through the porous scaffolds . 
In simple terms , permeability is characterised by using gradient pressure to push liquid through porous material . 
Zhang stated that permeability may influence vascular invasion and the supply of nutrients required to sustain cell growth and may also provide an outlet for the removal of cell debris , thereby increasing its osteoconductive potential . 
High permeability of titanium implants enhances the osseointegration process . 
Further research on the effect of permeability of porous metallic implants is in demand . 
In summary , porosity , pore size and pore interconnectivity are key factors that will significantly influence the mechanical properties and biological performance of scaffolds such as bone ingrowth and transportation of cells and nutrients . 
For example , increasing the porosity may enhance the biological processes , but it can decrease the stiffness and strength drastically . 
Therefore , finding the optimal topologies for scaffolds is of critical importance . 
However , conventional CAD-based design techniques are inefficient and usually fail to obtain the optimal scaffold design because a prohibitively large number of trials would be required in order to achieve a balanced performance , e.g. 
, desirable stiffness and good permeability . 
On the contrary , topology optimization techniques are capable of quickly finding the optimal topologies which satisfy multiple objectives and constraints simultaneously to provide site-specific biological performance . 
3 Topological design of porous metallic structures for orthopaedic implants 3.1 Porous metallic implants and topology optimization techniques As mentioned previously , bone is a 3D inhomogeneous structure with elaborate features from macro-to nano-scales . 
While it is impossible , and perhaps unnecessary , to recreate all details of natural bone in the porous metallic implant , ideally the implant should have similar hierarchical configurations on multiple scales . 
It is essential that the implant should possess properties similar to the host bone and the ambient tissue . 
This calls for a well-established design methodology integrating structural stiffness with fluid permeability to allow the implant to have both adequate rigidity to resist the physical loading and sufficient permeability to transfer cells , nutrients , etc . 
Fully solid metals , e.g . 
Such a stiffness mismatch is regarded as one of the most significant problems in implant design as the resulting stress shielding would often lead to implantation failures . 
Recently , porous metals were used in orthopaedic surgeries to replace damaged bones . 
Porous scaffolds are geometrically similar to natural hard tissues which are composed of constituting materials penetrated by interconnected pores . 
Porous metals can be designed to duplicate the properties of bones if their structures could be designed digitally and fabricated using advanced manufacturing technology . 
Conventional porous scaffolds typically consist of a vast number of randomly shaped pores in different sizes and therefore it is almost impossible to quantitatively analyse their properties . 
To obtain a simplified model , researchers usually assume that scaffolds are constructed of periodically-repeating unit cells along all directions and the architecture of the micro unit cells can distinctly define the macro properties of the scaffolds . 
Typical traditional design strategies of periodic bone scaffolds include Computer Aided Design , image-based design and implicit surfaces , as illustrated in 3 . 
CAD-based design are obtained by using various CAD tools . 
Computer-aided system for tissue scaffolds is a further development based on these scaffold libraries , aiming to efficiently automate the entire design process for desired topologies . 
Bio-inspired design is an alternative to improve the mechanical performance of bone scaffolds and enrich the scaffold library . 
Other CAD-based approaches may also be used in designing scaffolds . 
Image-based design , as proposed by Hollister , is based on Computed Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Image data for reconstruction of a defect . 
It uses Boolean combination of defect image and architecture image to create 3D scaffold image . 
Implicit surface modelling uses single mathematical equations to freely introduce pore shapes such as triply periodic minimal surfaces , which is highly flexible in designing scaffolds . 
CAD-based randomization approach starts from cell elements to fill a specific volume in computer software , where standard cell elements are usually packaged while new cell elements can also be created . 
This method can effectively imitate real bones by the randomization process , thus promoting the bone attachment and bone cell in-growth , as well as increasing the damage tolerance . 
While the aforementioned methods enable scaffolds to obtain desirable stiffness and permeability , these approaches demand a vast number of attempts to achieve anticipated properties . 
One of the main challenges in the application of porous scaffolds to orthopaedic implants is the adaptation of their mechanical and biomedical properties to those of natural bones . 
The implanted scaffolds are placed in a complex environment and their performance is affected by many factors . 
Some of them such as high permeability and good stiffness are competing with each other since a larger pore size is obtained usually at the cost of a lower mechanical strength . 
Hence , to increase the mass transfer , while retaining a strong supporting framework , there is a need to maintain a delicate trade-off between the porosity of the fabricated scaffold and its strength . 
Topology optimization a mathematical method capable of rearranging the materials to attain desired properties while satisfying prescribed constraints can complement the trial-and-error approach and provide a powerful tool to design complex scaffolds with features on multiple scales . 
It is a branch of computational mechanics and was originally developed in structural engineering . 
It has been widely used for designing structures and materials for desirable mechanical performance and physical properties . 
Through two decades of development , this method has gone far beyond the traditional structural engineering context . 
Typically , there are two ways to define a structure in topology optimization . 
The first is a point-by-point description in which a void or a solid phase in a local element is represented by an elemental density . 
The Evolutionary Structural Optimization and the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization methods use this type of description and have gained considerable success in solving a wide range of engineering optimization problems . 
In the field of computational material design , the topology optimization approach is termed as an homogenizationmethod because the homogenization method is used to calculate the effective properties of a unit cell and the material distribution is rearranged through topology optimization to enable the material to attain target properties . 
The seminal work of inverse homogenization was conducted by Sigmund in the 1990s for the design of materials with prescribed elastic properties . 
Thereafter , great achievements were obtained in the design of exceptional material properties including negative thermal expansion coefficient and negative refraction index . 
Later , this method was extended to the design of scaffold materials with their stiffness matrices matching those of anisotropic native bones . 
By using the SIMP based structural optimization , Guest and Prevost developed a topology optimization technique to find a scaffold with pores in the shape of a Schwartz primitive structure , resulting in the maximum permeability . 
They also combined bulk modulus and permeability in a single objective function and tailored these two competing properties in a multi-physics optimization problem . 
Using a similar density-based optimization method , scaffolds with elastic tensors similar to those of natural bones were designed ; and the performance of these scaffolds in subsequent tissue ingrowth was investigated . 
It is found that bone remodeling is at its best when the scaffold elastic tensor matches or is slightly higher than the elastic properties of the host bone . 
The last row in 3 shows the porous structures with the maximum bulk and shear moduli , respectively , at a given porosity . 
These unit cells were obtained using the Bi-directional Evolutionary Structural Optimization method , which shows faster convergence and unambiguous material definition . 
The BESO method , which allows the material to be added and removed simultaneously during the optimization process , is an extension of the original evolutionary ESO method proposed by Xie and Steven . 
As shown in 3 on topology optimization , various unit cells with maximal bulk modulus , maximal shear modulus , prescribed stiffness ratios in three directions , and functionally graded structures can be obtained through the BESO method . 
The second class of topology optimization methods , represented by the level-set algorithm , focus on tracking phase boundaries . 
The level-set method provides an effective technique to represent smooth boundaries and to control topology changes . 
A variational level-set technique for periodic material design problems governed by Navierand Maxwell 's equations was developed to attain material with maximal permeability . 
Level-set topology optimization enables the no-slip boundary condition of fluids in Stokes flow to be naturally satisfied . 
Periodic structures of scaffolds with the maximal effective diffusivity aimed at providing an ideal environment for nutrient transportation were studied by a level-set based optimization method . 
There have been tremendous advances in recent years in the area of using topology optimization techniques to design multi-functional materials with periodic structures , as shown in a comprehensive review by Cadman . 
Several of these developments are directly related to the design of scaffolds . 
Both stiffness and diffusive transport properties were considered by Hollister and Challis . 
Using topology optimization , Hollister and co-workers also created an interbody fusion cage for improved arthrodesis . 
The outcomes of their research were used in clinic to support bone regeneration for craniofacial reconstruction . 
3.2 Constraints in structural design for additive manufacturing Although AM can theoretically produce structures in any shape , the quality of the structures may vary significantly depending on the design and fabrication parameters . 
Therefore , it is necessary to consider the processability of the designed parts during the topological design process , including the constraints and limitations of AM technologies . 
However , there is still limited research on creating design guidelines to achieve this goal . 
Kranz experimentally investigated the restrictions of Laser Additive Manufacturing of Ti6Al4V and presented a comprehensive structured catalogue . 
In their research , restrictions and recommendations were presented based on experimental measurements of different characteristics such as cavities , walls , bores , gap , hollow cylinder , overhangs and support structures . 
They also found that the quality of AM parts was highly dependent on the materials , machines and process parameters . 
Therefore , similar guidelines could be achieved through similar methodology on different material systems . 
Among many parameters , frequently discussed one includes overhanging structures , which may lead to some undesirable defects . 
In an AM process , the overhanging structure is not supported by solidified section or bottom substrate when it is being built . 
Therefore , the overhanging structure is strongly influenced by the orientation of building - ) . 
Therefore , the critical fabrication angle is of great importance since it determines the form of overhanging structure , hence the processability . 
4 shows the sketch of a circular pore with overhanging arc AB , which can be processable if the fabrication angle were larger than the critical value c. Otherwise , supporting structures have to be used , which are normally avoided to prevent damage of parts in post-processing . 
A better choice in design is to adopt structures with special geometrical arrangement such as an octahedral lattice , whose lateral schematic is shown in 4 . 
When the downward sloping surface CD has a larger fabrication angle than the critical angle c , no supporting structures are required . 
There were also attempts to design structures so that they could be fabricated using AM without support . 
This approach is interesting and useful , but may not be generally applicable to scaffold designs . 
Other researchers examined the suitability of using SIMP and BESO topology optimization algorithms to design structures for AM . 
4 Current status of AM and topology optimization in producing porous metallic structures AM technologies are superior to conventional fabrication techniques for producing porous metallic implants with complex and customized structures , as shown in 5 . 
In addition to the geometric flexibility , composites with two or more phases can be manufactured . 
These advantages enable AM to become a promising tool for the production of biomedical implant devices , controlled drug delivery systems , and engineered tissues . 
Examples include artificial joints and load-bearing implants produced by AM using biocompatible materials such as hydroxyapatite , Ti , Ta and Coalloys and customized prostheses such as intervertebral spacers . 
There has been growing research interest in using topology optimization to design bone scaffolds and orthopaedic implants , however significant challenges still remain before these concepts could be used in clinical practice . 
An important issue that may not be neglected when applying topology optimization to scaffold design is to consider the differences in physical , chemical and mechanical properties of base materials produced by AM and conventional fabrication techniques . 
The material property in AM process may greatly affect the final topological shape of scaffold , which may differ from the original CAD model obtained from topology optimization . 
Moreover , good understanding of the change in mechanical properties in AM process may assist more accurate optimal design in topology optimization procedure . 
This section will review the status of research on AM fabrication of three main families of alloys and the application of topology optimization . 
4.1 Biocompatible Ti alloys Metals in biological systems may experience corrosion and release ions , which may result in many adverse physiological effects . 
Therefore , the biocompatibility of any implant must be quantified to decrease the patient 's risk and the failure of the implantation . 
The cytotoxicity of typical surgical implant alloys and pure metals have been broadly studied in the past decades . 
It is now commonly accepted that vanadium may cause sterile abscess and aluminium may cause scar tissue , whereas titanium , zirconium , niobium and tantalum exhibit excellent biocompatibility . 
Another important motivation behind the design of biocompatible Ti alloys is the opportunity to decrease the modulus of Ti alloys by adding elements . 
As mentioned above , the elements should be biocompatible . 
Various Ti alloys composed of low modulus biocompatible elements were developed . 
These alloys exhibited lower modulus than the commonly used Ti6Al4V . 
One example is Ti13Nb13Zr , which showed improved bone biocompatibility and a modulus of 79 GPa . 
Other Ti alloys which exhibited lower modulus included Ti29Nb13Ta4.6Zr and Ti35Nb5Ta7Zr . 
In recent years , AM produced porous Ti alloy scaffolds were widely reported with Ti6Al4V in dominance , such as the Ti6Al4V implants in sheep cervical spine in 5 . 
Ryan combined the multi-stage AM technology with the powder metallurgy process to produce porous Ti alloy scaffolds using wax templates generated by CAD . 
The pore size of their designs ranged from 200 to 400 and the porosity reached 66.8 % . 
This method could achieve controlled porous structure and ensure high resolution in manufacturing . 
The resulting microstructure and surface roughness were similar to parts manufactured by conventional methods . 
This method could also be extended to the fabrication of other metallic structures which are difficult to be directly made by AM . 
Murr manufactured different porous Ti6Al4V implants using AM based on micro-CT scan and CAD models built by Materialise software . 
They studied the influence of geometric features of unit cells on the mechanical properties of the porous structures and found that when the porosity changed from 59 % to 88 % , the elastic modulus decreased from 3.03 to 0.58 GPa , which proved that the elastic modulus of porous metals could be readily adjusted through the porosity . 
Similarly Pattanyak studied porous Ti implants based on micro-CT scan on human cancellous bones , which focused on structures with complicated internal structures for bone ingrowth applications . 
The implants were manufactured via SLM using Ti powder of less than 45 in size . 
They found that the compressive strength decreased from 120 to 35 MPa when the porosity changed from 55 % to 75 % . 
Hollander produced a variety of Ti6Al4V implants , ranging from porous cylinder to solid human vertebra model with irregular shapes . 
Porous Ti6Al4V structures were shown to be effective in supporting cell growth and new bone tissue growth , and cell based study suggested that Ti6Al4V possesses high cyto-biocompatibility . 
In vitro studies were performed with porous Ti6Al4V structures . 
Cell spreading and proliferation were observed across the entire surface and inside the porous structure . 
Porous Ti6Al4V scaffolds were found performing well in animal models since induced new bone growth and osseointegration were achieved on both bare and surface-coated porous Ti6Al4V structures . 
Although porous Ti6Al4V had been widely studied , the potential release of toxic ions led researchers towards looking for safer alternative alloys . 
Therefore , Ti alloys such as Ti24Nb4Zr8Sn , Ti7.5Mo and Ti40Nb were designed and fabricated by AM , which exhibited comparable mechanical properties to their counterparts by conventional manufacturing approaches . 
There was significant research interest in using topology optimization for the design of porous Ti alloy scaffolds . 
While early works mainly focused on the theoretical consideration of the structural design of the unit cells , recent efforts put more emphasis on integrating topology optimization with AM , e.g . 
Refs.. 4.2 Shape memory alloys Shape Memory Alloys are capable of regaining their original shape after severe deformations when stimulated by external environments . 
Due to this unique property , SMAs have found their way in orthopaedic implant applications . 
Typical SMAs include NiTi or nitinol which normally contains approximately 50 at % Ni and 50 at % Ti . 
The shape memory effect in NiTi comes from the austenite/martensite phase transformation since martensite is a low temperature stable phase with the absence of stress whereas austenite is a high temperature stable phase . 
Currently , more than 90 % of all commercial SMAs are based on NiTi and its ternary alloys - NiTiCu and NiTiNb . 
Solid NiTi has a modulus of 48 GPa , which is much lower than other Ti alloys . 
Furthermore , NiTi allows for relatively large reversible deformation of up to 8 % . 
NiTi has higher stiffness than bone under tendon , and is able to deform over a large strain range at an almost constant stress . 
Due to these characteristics , NiTi has been widely used in medical devices , such as surgical tools , stents , orthodontic wires , plates and staples for bone fractures . 
Main attractive features of SMAs are : capability to recover the original shape after large deformation , capability to recover the original shape from a stable deformed shape when heated and a high damping capacity . 
For biomedical applications , the presence of Ni in NiTi has been a continuous concern since Ni is one of the highest sensitivities in metallic allergy tests . 
Therefore , attempts were made either to develop surface modification techniques or to use substitution elements to mitigate this effect without sacrificing the biocompatibility . 
For example , TiNb and the related TiNbX system were developed which exhibited elastic strains as high as 4.2 % . 
Common methods for making porous NiTi structures are based on powder metallurgy and self-propagating high temperature synthesis of a mixture of elemental powders or pre-alloyed NiTi powder with space holding materials . 
After removing space holding materials at relatively low temperature , the structures are further sintered at high temperature . 
Due to high reactivity of Ti and Ni , the sintering of porous structures is normally done in high vacuum . 
However , these methods have difficulties in precisely controlling the porous structures of NiTi , i.e. 
, pore size and pore shape . 
To overcome this problem , AM technologies such as SLM have been used to produce NiTi implants . 
It was shown that AM produced NiTi parts exhibited similar mechanical properties as those fabricated by conventional methods such as casting . 
In contrary to the substantial research on Ti alloys , no reports on the application of topology optimization in the design of SMA scaffolds involving AM fabrication can be found in the literature up to date . 
4.3 Biodegradable metals Biodegradable materials , including both polymer-based and metal-based ones , are used for some medical implants which will gradually degrade in human body over a period of time . 
In some clinical cases , biomaterials are only needed temporarily in the body and are expected to support the healing process and to disappear after the healing process is completed . 
5 shows a biodegradable Mg stent after expansion . 
Compared to polymer-based materials , biodegradable metals have higher stiffness and strength , and are more suitable for load bearing conditions . 
As the degradable alloys are expected to degrade inside human body , the main compositions of the alloys should be metallic elements that can be metabolized , and demonstrate appropriate degradation rates in the human body . 
Due to its unique characteristics , Mg alloys were used to manufacture cardiovascular stents and bone screws . 
The degradable magnesium alloy bone screws were found clinically equivalent to the conventional Ti screws ; and no foreign body reaction , osteolysis , or systemic inflammatory reaction were observed for the Mg alloy screws . 
A key parameter that needs to be considered in designing a biodegradable metallic implant is its degradation rate in human body . 
Pure Mg is known to have a fast degradation in high chloride physiological environment but it may produce hydrogen gas at a high rate from corrosion , which can not be dealt with by the host tissue . 
Fe-based biodegradable materials are known to exhibit a slow degradation rate . 
Animal tests showed that large portions of the pure Fe stent remained intact in the blood vessels 12 months post-surgery . 
Alloying is a typical method to adjust the degradation rate of a metal . 
For instance , by adding elements such as Y , Sr , Zn , Zr and Ca , Mg alloys were shown to have much lower degradation rates in comparison with pure Mg . 
Such alloys also exhibited high strength , which is desirable for load-bearing applications . 
In addition to alloying , amorphous structures like metallic glass alloys MgZnCa showed low degradation rate and high strength . 
However , metallic glass alloys are generally difficult to manufacture , which would add the cost to the application of this type of material . 
Porous Mg alloy implants were investigated as temporary bone replacements in an animal model . 
They were shown to be able to enhance bone remodelling and appropriate host response . 
However , porous Mg alloys degrade too rapidly in vivo , which may leave subcutaneous gas cavities . 
Since an open porous implant has large surface area , only alloys with slow degradation rate should be considered for making the porous structure , e.g . 
Mg-4 wt. 
% Y . 
The element yttrium helps promote grain refinement , thus resulting in a slow degradation and sufficient cyto-compatibility . 
Nguyen manufactured porous Mg alloys using SLM and suggested that the dimension , surface morphology and the oxygen pick-up of the laser-melted Mg were strongly dependent on the laser processing parameters . 
Due to the high evaporation rate at elevated temperatures , few attempts were made to fabricate Mg scaffolds directly using AM . 
Instead , a technique combining 3D printing and gravity casting was shown to be effective in producing topologically-ordered porous Mg structures , where a porous NaCl mould was created using SLM and then Mg alloy was cast into the mould . 
After removing the NaCl , porous Mg structure with porosity of 41 % and pore size of 1 mm was obtained . 
The compressive strength of the porous Mg was reported to be 13 MPa , which is comparable to porous Mg produced by powder metallurgy . 
A review on porous biodegradable metals for hard tissue scaffolds can be found in Ref.. A theoretical study of topological design of polymeric scaffolds considering the effect of biodegradation was conducted by Chen . 
No reports on the application of topology optimization in the design of biodegradable metallic scaffolds involving AM fabrication have appeared in the literature so far . 
5 Heat-treatment and surface modification of porous metallic structures produced by AM 5.1 Heat-treatment The mechanical properties of AM produced materials depend heavily on the processing parameters , including building layer thickness , scan speed , energy density and focal offset distance . 
Usually AM produced materials have relatively high yield stress and ultimate tensile strength , but a relatively low ductility . 
In order to improve the mechanical properties of AM produced porous biomaterials so that they can mimic the human tissues and fulfil the desired functions , post-treatment is of critical importance . 
It is known that the microstructures of as-built materials by AM are very different from those by traditional casting or forging approaches . 
AM is a layer-wise build-up process with high cooling rates that lead to significant internal thermal stresses in the structure . 
During the building process , the scanning by either a laser or an electron beam may cause the instabilities of the melt pool , resulting in increased porosity and high surface roughness . 
The post-treatment process also enables the reduction of thermal stresses in AM produced structures . 
For Ti6Al4V , post heat-treatment is typically performed within the + region , which can control the morphology and size of the without significantly influencing the prior-grain size . 
A proper heat-treatment process may substantially improve the mechanical properties of AM produced materials . 
Thone observed significant improvement in ductility and fatigue strength after heat-treatment of SLM produced Ti6Al4V . 
They revealed that the tensile strength of heat-treated Ti6Al4V slightly decreased from 1080 MPa to 945 MPa but the elongation at failure increased significantly from 1.6 % to 11.6 % , along with remarkably prolonged fatigue life of parts from 28,900 to 290,000 cycles . 
The improvements in the mechanical properties after post heat-treatment are mainly due to the elimination of thermal stresses and the changes of microstructures . 
On the other hand , an adequate selection of AM processing variables can facilitate in-situ heat treatment . 
The microstructure of Ti6Al4V made by SLM is often dominated by martensite due to rapid cooling , which can be decomposed to lamellar + structure during SLM process by tuning the processing variables . 
After the optimization of processing conditions , Xu produced Ti6Al4V with comparable or better mechanical properties than forged Ti6Al4V . 
5.2 Surface modification Surface modification plays an important role in enhancing the biological performance of AM produced porous biomaterials , particularly bioactivity and biocompatibility . 
Ti alloys are normally covered by one layer of 3nm thick native oxide , namely TiO2 , which provides excellent chemical inertness , corrosion resistance and biocompatibility . 
In the human body , Ti alloy implants may experience non-specific protein adsorption and interrogation of neutrophils and macrophages , which may attract fibroblasts to an encapsulation process . 
To ensure an effective biological bond between Ti alloy implants and surrounding bones , surface modification is essential to improve the conductivity of bones or the bioactivity of titanium . 
The surface morphology of Ti alloy implants depends on the history of material processing . 
For AM produced porous Ti alloys , powders tend to become small liquid spheres when heated up by laser or electron beams . 
Such a effect is a complex metallurgical process that leads to a rough surface and residual powder particles . 
These loosely connected powder particles can be removed through blasting or other post-processing methods before implantation . 
Surface modification or activation of Ti surface can be achieved by various techniques such as plasma spray , physical or chemical vapour deposition , ion implantation , electrochemical oxidation , acidic or alkali etching , solheat-treatment , and surface machining or grinding . 
For porous metallic structures , there are two main approaches , based on surface coating and surface corrosion . 
A popular coating-based method is solprocess , which is a simple yet versatile method for creating oxide coatings at relatively low temperatures . 
For implants with a complex topology , dip coating is normally used . 
The solprocess may deposit thin inorganic coatings . 
The chemical composition and microstructures of the coating can be better controlled by the solprocess than by other methods . 
Brie used solto form a bioceramic coating on porous Ti6Al7Nb implants . 
The coating uniformly covered the external and internal surfaces of the implants ; and the coated porous structures exhibited improved biocompatibility . 
Other methods include electrolytic deposition and plasma spray . 
ED can produce CaP coatings having a thickness of a few microns to several hundred microns , which can be controlled by applying appropriate current density and processing time . 
This may also assist to control the surface morphology of CaP coatings from needle-like to plate-like structures . 
Coating through ED can produce uniformly and fully covered surface , which makes it suitable for functionalizing porous structures . 
Chai found that the bioactivity of the CaP coated Ti6Al4V scaffold to ) was significantly improved and it was possible to produce osteoinductive for the repair of bone defects . 
Corrosion-based surface treatment involves interfacial chemical reactions of structures in corrosive solution . 
Such chemical processes include alkali treatment , acid etching and anodization treatments . 
5 to show the surface morphology of scaffold before and after HCl etching treatment . 
The chemical reaction may produce a thin oxide layer on the surface of the metal , usually resulting in improved bioactivity . 
The thickness of the active layer can be controlled from tens of nanometer to hundreds of microns by adjusting processing variables . 
Alkali treatment was initially introduced by Kim to improve the bioactivity of Ti implants owing to a biologically active bone-like apatite layer on Ti surface . 
Anodization is a mature electrochemical process capable of producing protective layers on the metal surface with adjustable surface microstructure and crystal structure . 
Special care should be taken with regard to the possible negative effect on mechanical properties after corrosion-based surface treatment . 
It was reported that alkali treatment might result in the deterioration of mechanical strength of porous Ti alloy scaffolds and also cause the embrittlement of the struts in the scaffolds . 
6 Challenges and future directions Additive manufacturing provides unprecedented opportunities for producing customized medical implants as this technology can fabricate structures of complex external shapes and intricate internal architectures . 
Topology optimization has become a powerful digital tool for the design of optimal structures and materials . 
The integration of these two technologies sees a promising future in designing and manufacturing biocompatible orthopaedic implants with desired mechanical properties and minimal side effects on patients in clinical applications . 
Key challenges and future directions in integrating the two technologies are as follows : i ) A comprehensive and reliable database containing detailed information on the mechanical and biological properties of human bones is yet to be established . 
This database should include properties of bones for different age , gender groups and at different locations . 
Such information is required as the design of the topology optimization process . 
ii ) Sophisticated topology optimization algorithms capable of dealing with multi-functional designs on multiple length scales simultaneously needs to be developed . 
Preliminary studies along this line can be found in Refs.. iii ) Topological design of the lattice structures that can be easily produced by AM and exhibit anisotropic mechanical properties similar to human bones is another promising direction , despite that the fact that there has been extensive research on topology optimization based on continuum models . 
iv ) Constraints and limitations of current AM technologies , such as the critical angle of the overhanging structure and the difficulty in removing the supporting structure , should be involved in newly-developed topology optimization algorithms so that the designs could actually be fabricated by AM . 
v ) The long-term in vivo material/biological performance of porous metallic implants that are designed through topology optimization techniques and produced by AM needs to be rigorously assessed in order to ascertain the advantages and drawbacks of such implants . 
vi ) Novel alloying systems capable of enhancing the mechanical and biological performance of porous metallic implants are in great demand , together with new post-treatment technologies for improving the bioactivity and biocompatibility . 
7 Conclusions In this paper , the current status of the topological design of porous metallic implants and the fabrication of such implants using additive manufacturing is reviewed . 
First the mechanical properties of human bones are discussed . 
Then it is demonstrated that topology optimization is a powerful digital tool that can be used to obtain optimal internal architectures for porous implants which not only satisfy multifunctional requirements but also mimic human bones . 
Furthermore it is shown that additive manufacturing is the most promising and disruptive technology in the fabrication of porous orthopaedic implants designed through topology optimization . 
To further improve the mechanical and biological performance of these structures , both post-treatment and surface modification are necessary . 
Based on these discussions , challenges and future directions of the integration topology optimization with additive manufacturing are identified . 
This review provides useful information to researchers and practitioners who are working in various areas of the truly multidisciplinary topic of bone implant design and fabrication Additive manufacturing of polymer-fiber composites has transformed AM into a robust manufacturing paradigm and enabled producing highly customized parts with significantly improved mechanical properties , compared to un-reinforced polymers . 
Almost all commercially available AM methods could benefit from various fiber reinforcement techniques . 
Recent developments in 3D printing methods of fiber reinforced polymers , namely , fused deposition modeling , laminated object manufacturing , stereolithography , extrusion , and selective laser sintering are reviewed in this study to understand the trends and future directions in the respective areas . 
In addition to extra strength , fibers have also been used in 4D printing to control and manipulate the change of shape or swelling after 3D printing , right out of the printing bed . 
Although AM of fiber/polymer composites are increasingly developing and under intense attention , there are some issues needed to be addressed including void formation , poor adhesion of fibers and matrix , blockage due to filler inclusion , increased curing time , modelling , simulation , etc . 
Additive manufacturing , also known as 3D printing , is defined asa process of adding materials to fabricate objects from three-dimensional models in successive layers , versus traditional subtractive manufacturing methods . 
Numerous novel AM processes have been developed over the span of more than 20years of AM development with applications in aerospace , automotive , biomedical , digital art , architectural design , etc . 
There has been an exponential increase in AM technology in recent years and it continues to grow due to its versatility and low cost for rapid prototyping and manufacturing applications . 
All of these features , combined with AMcustomizability to fabricate complex monolithic structures and geometries , with micrometer resolution , helped AM grow to a multibillion-dollar industry . 
To date , the dominant part of the 3D printing industry has immensely relied on single material printing . 
This issue , paired with limited choices of available resins compatible with commercial printers , has severely limited variations in the physical and chemical properties of 3D printed objects . 
These limitations have led to development of multi-material printers with partial control on material composition and properties , offering layered composite materials . 
Furthermore , multiple printing heads have allowed printing blended composites with functional and variable features . 
3D printing of fiber reinforced composites is currently conducted by stereolithography , laminated object manufacturing , fused deposition modeling , selective laser sintering , and extrusion . 
This is one of the hottest topics in the field of additive manufacturing and is under intense attention . 
This also offers significant improvement in mechanical properties , however , it requires a complex procedure to be manufactured and is difficult to be incorporated into processing . 
Implementing the traditional methods of composite manufacturing in AM is not practical and new technologies are needed to assist with the development of new AM methods . 
Advances in development of composite 3D printers have not prevented development in pre-blended materials with fillers such as nanoparticles , carbon nanotubes , fibers and graphene in order to achieve unique characteristics and capabilities . 
Fiber reinforcement , in particular , appears to be an attractive filler to improve the properties of polymers . 
Pre-blended materials using discontinuous fibers asan additive have been under intense investigation asa suitable alternative to multi-head printers with complex and costly designs . 
These additive based materials exhibit unique characteristics and capabilities , depending on the additive used . 
Suitable mechanical , electrical , or thermal properties can be accomplished in an inexpensive manner . 
Polymers , in particular , have been the center of attention due to ease of production and availability . 
The 3D printing industry primarily involves polymers in various forms , such as reactive , liquid solutions , and thermoplastic melts . 
These benefits , joined by enhancements from fiber reinforcement , offer a favorable combination for future development of AM technology . 
In addition , almost all of the existing AM methods can be benefited from fiber reinforcement . 
Although fiber reinforcement in 3D printing sounds promising , there are numerous issues which need to be resolved . 
Namely , the effect of fibers on resolution , agglomerate formation , heterogeneous composite formation , blockage of printer heads , non-adhesion , and increased curing times . 
This paper reviews recent advances in AM of polymer based fiber reinforced composites and potential methods for modelling and analysis of these 3D printed structures . 
Latest development and improvement to existing methods will be reviewed in detail , in order to understand the challenges in 3D printing of polymer composites with fiber reinforcement . 
3D printing of fiber reinforced polymer composites Fiber reinforcement can greatly improve the properties of 3D printed parts with polymer matrix . 
Fiber orientation and void content of composites are the main concerns in 3D printing of these composites . 
Most of the commercially available 3D printing techniques would benefit from fiber reinforcement . 
In this section , all of these techniques for 3D printing of polymer-fiber composites are reviewed in detail to demonstrate their strengths and weaknesses in additive manufacturing of polymer-fiber composites . 
These methods are FDM , LOM , SL , extrusion , and SLS . 
2.1 Fused deposition modeling FDM is currently the most applied AM technology , according to WohlerReport from Stratasys , Inc. Commercial FDM machines held 41.5 % of the market share , with the total of 15,000 FDM machines sold by the end of 2010 . 
The key elements of the FDM system include material feed mechanism , liquefier , print head , gantry , and build surface . 
Several process parameters are essential in FDM , including bead width , air gap , model build temperature , and raster orientation . 
The effects of raster orientation on tensile and compression test results have been investigated in detail . 
The temperature distribution during the FDM process can be monitored by IR camera . 
The surface roughness and cross section shape of the FDM fabricated parts are under intense study . 
1 and 2 illustrate the bonding mechanism in the FDM of polymer composites along cross-section of printed parts . 
Several building rules have been proposed to improve the strength and accuracy of the FDM printed parts , such as build parts to ensure tensile loads are carried axially along printed directions , deal with the stress concentration at corners , use negative air gap to increase both strength and stiffness , consider that small bead width leads to extra printing time and better surface quality , be aware the part accuracy affected by the build orientation , and realize that tensile loaded area tends to fail easier than compression loaded area . 
Recently , fiber reinforcement in FDM has been very popular amongst researchers . 
Most of the efforts have focused on development of filaments with short fiber additives . 
Inclusion of fibers in filament reduces tape swelling at the printing head during deposition and increases the stiffness . 
Glass fiber reinforced polypropylene was evaluated by Carneiro , Silva and showed 30 % and 40 % improvement for the modulus and strength , respectively , compared to pure PP . 
Vapor grown carbon fibers and single wall carbon nanotubes were compounded with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene for the FDM process . 
The VGCFs can be easily aligned by the extrusion process . 
Tensile strength of 5wt % of VGCFs and SWNTs filled FDM parts increased 18 % and 31 % , respectively . 
However , the strain to failure of printed parts reinforced with VGCFs and SWNTs was dramatically decreased . 
ABS containing oriented VGCFs and SWNTs exhibited modulus improvements up to 93 % . 
The fiber orientation can be observed in 3 . 
Thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers with excellent tensile strength , such as ABS and polypropylene , were used in fiber reinforced FDM parts in order to overcome the drawbacks of low aspect ratio of fiber in short fiber filled parts . 
Processing temperature was one of the important parameters which affects the surface morphology of TLCP and its mechanical behavior . 
Higher carbon fiber ratio has a high maximum decomposition temperature , thus providing high thermal stability . 
Ning , Cong evaluated the effect of weight ratio and length of carbon fiber on physical properties of the FDM samples with ABS matrix . 
The 5 and 7.5wt % carbon fiber content showed the best improvement in tensile strength and Young 's modulus , respectively . 
These researchers have also concluded that longer carbon fibers can increase tensile strength and Young 's modulus at the expense of toughness and ductility . 
As described in 4 , with aligned carbon fiber during the FDM process , 30wt % CF-ABS composites exhibited great improvement in strength and Youngmodulus . 
These printed CF-ABS parts exhibit specific strength higher than Aluminum . 
The triangular channels between beads decreased by incorporating carbon fibers due to the reduced die-swell and increased thermal conductivity . 
However , inclusion of carbon fiber into the feedstock caused internal voids inside of the beads responsible for stress concentration , resulting in failure at lower stresses . 
It can be seen in 5 that the FDM samples exhibited significant pore formation , with internal voids , as well as voids formed between the deposited beads during printing . 
Continuous fiber reinforcement is currently one of the biggest challenges researchers face in 3D printing of polymer composites . 
It offers significant improvement in mechanical properties compared to discontinuous fibers , however , there is still no robust and standard paradigm developed for 3D printing of continuous fiber composites . 
Recently , Matsuzaki , Ueda developed an innovative technique for in-nozzle impregnation of continuous fiber and thermoplastic matrix . 
The resin filament and fiber were supplied separately , before heating and mixing in the printing head . 
The schematic of this process demonstrating the printing head and continuous fiber integration is presented in 6 . 
Carbon fibers and twisted yarns of natural jute fibers were used as reinforcement . 
Superiority of continuous fiber composites versus short fiber reinforcement and other 3D printing methods can be observed in 7 . 
Namiki , Ueda implemented the same technique for printing polyactic acid /carbon fiber composite parts . 
Some gaps were reported between PLA filaments , which can be reduced by increasing the resolution . 
Tensile strength of continuous carbon fiber reinforced PLA prepared by FDM , as reported by Li , Li , can reach up to 91MPa , while in the case of short carbon fiber , it is only 68MPa . 
Weak bonding between PLA and carbon fiber can significantly affect the mechanical properties in this method , however , surface modification of carbon fiber bundle with methylene dichloride and PLA particles improved adhesion and increased tensile and flexural strength . 
8 presents the ultimate tensile and flexural strength of pure PLA , carbon fiber-PLA , and modified carbon fiber-PLA . 
Green circles in 8 indicate different phases of the tensile process , namely , loading of the PLA material between fixture and test sample at the beginning of the test and a slight drop of the curve slope due to fiber-matrix interface debonding . 
Marked circles in 8 signify the process of load change from resin to fiber at the beginning of the test . 
The next circle in 8 shows the plastic elongation of PLA polymer chains that continue to bear load after the failure of carbon fibers . 
Tian , Liu performed a systemic analysis on interface and performance of printed continuous carbon fiber reinforced PLA composites and the effect of process parameters on the temperature and pressure in the process . 
9 shows cross-section of the tensile bar and continuous fibers in the fracture surface , and 10 demonstrates the capability of this method in 3D printing large curvatures , without losing the continuous fiber reinforcement . 
Melenka , Cheung evaluated continuous Kevlar fiber-reinforced 3D printed Nylon structures using commercial desktop printers in order to predict the tensile properties . 
Stiffness and ultimate strength showed significant increase with high volume of fiber reinforcement . 
Carbon fibers were placed between layers of 3D printed polymer to improve strength and fatigue life , while thermal treatment was performed to further increase the mechanical properties . 
However , Van Der Klift , Koga showed that increasing the number of carbon fiber layers results in larger void areas , which had negative effect on the tensile strength . 
Impregnation of plastics into the fiber bundle could be achieved in the temperature range of 200Layer thickness of 0.4and hatch spacing of about 0.6mm guaranteed bonding strength between lines and layers . 
These parameters could achieve maximum flexural strength of 335MPa and flexural modulus of 30GPa . 
2.2 Laminated object manufacturing In LOM , which was developed by Helisys of Torrance , CA and shipped in 1991 , 3D parts are manufactured by cutting 2D cross-sections with a laser or cutter and sequentially laminating the sheets . 
Paper , metals , plastics , fabrics , synthetic materials , and composites are amongst the materials that can be utilized in LOM . 
Polymer matrix composites of C-shaped panels were directly fabricated by curved LOM . 
A vacuum thermoforming apparatus was applied to bond commercial prepregs . 
The shear strength of fabricated composites was measured to be approximately 24.8MPa , which was suggested by the authors to be acceptable for normal applications . 
The LOM process was applied to print 3D parts of unidirectional and continuous glass fibers with 52and epoxy matrix . 
The final part and its cross section are presented in 13 . 
Decent interfacial bonding was shown by interlayer microstructures of LOM polymer composites . 
The major issue for the LOM process was the incapability of the heat roller to bring parts to full consolidation and cure . 
It is helpful to increase the interface strength and reduce void contents to under 5 % by a post consolidation cycle . 
Sonmez and Hahn studied heat transfer and stress in LOM to understand the effect of process parameters on the resulting stress and temperature distributions . 
Large rollers were more favorable for bonding , due to a less concentrated stress distribution . 
Recently , a new method called laser assisted AM for continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic composites was developed by researchers at Kansas State University , with the motivation of reducing the waste associated with LOM . 
The authors proposed using prepreg tape instead of pre-cut prepreg sheet . 
The tape strips were placed layer by layer using a CO2 laser beam and consolidation roller , prior to laser cutting of each layer . 
14 demonstrates this process schematically , as well as its tensile properties in comparison with various AM and conventional methods of composite manufacturing . 
This method exhibits superior mechanical properties due to continuous fiber reinforcement , high fiber weight ratio , minimized void content , and superior interfacial bonding . 
2.3 Stereolithography The 3D parts fabricated by SL exhibit weak mechanical properties , which hinder their further applications as functional components under loading conditions . 
However , adding fibers to the resin can increase the potential of SL in 3D printing functional components . 
Although continuous fiber is ideal for reinforcement , high weight ratio of short fibers can yield comparable results , however , their efficiency is limited due to fracture during mixing , random orientation , and un-even length . 
Multi-wall carbon nanotubes with a low weight ratio were mixed in SL resin by mechanical mixing and ultrasonic dispersion . 
The tensile strength and fracture strength were increased by 5.7 % and 26 % , respectively , by adding 0.025wt % MWNTs . 
Carbon fiber has been successfully applied to reinforce polymers , however , the primary issue for utilizing carbon fiber in SL is that it is opaque to the UV light . 
Consequently , regions of the resin blocked by carbon fibers remains uncured by UV light . 
Using glass fiber instead of carbon fiber can be beneficial for decreasing the opacity to UV light . 
The SL plus vacuum cast process was investigated to improve the tensile strength . 
Tensile samples produced by SL and polymer-glass fiber nonwoven-polymer sandwich structures were introduced by vacuum cast , which showed a significant increase of 36 % in ultimate tensile strength and 11 % increase in stiffness . 
The viscosity of the resin , especially at low shear rates , increased in the composite resins with significant volume fractions of fibers . 
The surface coating of fibers can effectively reduce the viscosity , which is an advantage which allows processing of resins with higher fiber concentrations . 
Laser scanning based SL was used to add 20vol % of short glass fibers into an acrylic based photo polymer . 
15 shows the microstructures of molded and laser-scanned specimen with 20vol % glass fiber . 
Fiber filled composites represents a higher elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength . 
The shrinkage of fiber reinforced composites was also observed to be lower than their non-reinforced counterparts . 
Dual porlymerization scheme , including UV radiation and thermal treatments , was proposed to cure resins containing a high volume ratio of carbon fibers . 
It was estimated that one quarter of resin remains uncured , which was primarily inside of carbon fibers . 
After an hour of thermal treatment , the tensile strength was increased by 95 % . 
Llewellyn-Jones , Drinkwater used ultrasonic manipulation to distribute glass microfibers in the resin . 
A variety of fiber orientation angles were achieved , demonstrating the versatility of the process . 
This method allows smart material fabrication , such as resin-filled capsules for self-healing or piezoelectric particles for energy harvesting . 
2.4 Extrusion Extrusion , as one of the most recent developments in 3D printing , emerged to overcome the limitations of the FDM method with its versatility and cost-effectiveness . 
In this AM technique , layers of the material solution are directly deposited in a volatile solvent to produce freeform 3D structures . 
Lightweight cellular carbon fiber and SiC whiskers filled composites have been demonstrated by applying 3D extrusion printing method , as described in 16 . 
Epoxy-based inks , which exhibited the desired viscoelasticity and long pot-life in the absence and presence of highly anisotropic carbon fibers , were prepared . 
The SiC-filled and SiC/C filled transverse specimens showed a substantial increase in Youngmodulus , over the pure resin from 2.66 to 10.61 and 8.06 respectively . 
Tensile strength of printed composites was comparable to the cast epoxy resin samples , with longitudinal specimens exhibiting slightly higher strength than that the transverse specimens . 
17 shows a comparison in tensile strength of 3D printed tensile bars , using various fillers , as well as their microstructure . 
PLA/MWNTs composite was used to fabricate conductive 3D microstructures , with arbitrary shapes as small as 100with a method called liquid deposition modeling . 
2.5 Selective laser sintering SLS is a powder based AM process . 
The laser scans the powder bed , layer by layer , to form a 3D structure , as demonstrated in 18 . 
It mainly deals with wax , ceramics , metals and polymers . 
Major polymers used by SLS include nylon , i.e . 
polyamide , crystalline thermoplastics : polyethylene , PEEK , and PCL . 
SLS can be categorized in solid state sintering , liquid phase sintering-partial melting , full melting , and chemically induced binding . 
SSS is a thermal process that occurs at temperatures between TMelt /2 and TMelt , where TMelt is the melting temperature . 
In liquid phase sintering-partial melting , usually the binder material becomes liquefied , while structural material remains solid . 
The full melting technique melts the powder entirely and exhibits properties comparable to those of bulk material . 
It can be applied to a wide variety of materials , however , the long process time and preheating of powders is necessary . 
1 lists the range of materials and their associated binding mechanism in SLS . 
CNT was added in Polyamide 12 in order to improve the mechanical behaviors . 
The laser sintered parts had 13 % greater flexural modulus , 10.9 % higher flexural strength , and 54 % larger Youngmodulus . 
The crystallization temperature of PA12-CNT powder was increased , compared to the pure PA12 , which was responsible in hindering the movement of PA12 chains by the interfacial force between CNTs and PA12 . 
However , the porosity also increased in the CNT composites . 
MWNTs were also mixed with PA12 for the investigation of its effect on mechanical properties . 
Goodridge , Shofner also confirmed enhancement in mechanical properties of PA12 with inclusion of CNT , exhibiting 22 % increase in storage modulus . 
A high volume ratio of carbon fiber was added into PA12 . 
CNT-coated PA12 also improved heat conduction and heat absorption compared to pure PA12.. 
Furthermore , simulation results on laser sintering of PA12-CNT suggested that inclusion of CNT helps the laser heat to be conducted wider and deeper into the powder bed . 
The result of these simulations can be observed in 19 . 
Uniform distribution of carbon fibers and good interfacial adhesion between fibers and matrix was achieved by pre-modification of carbon fibers through oxidation . 
By adding the maximum weight ratio of carbon fibers , the flexural strength and flexural modulus were enhanced 114 % and 243.4 % , respectively . 
Glass beads were used asadditives in SLS of Nylon powders , in order to determine the mechanical properties , as a function of material composition . 
Zhu , Yan proposed a novel method to prepare high-performance carbon fibers/PA12/epoxy ternary composites by infiltrating the porous green carbon fibers/PA12 parts built by SLS , with high-performance thermosetting epoxy resin , prior to curing the resin ; this process is described in 20 . 
The end result is a ternary composite system with novolac epoxy resin , reinforced with carbon fibers coated with a thin 595nm layer of PA12 . 
This method with 33 % volume fraction of carbon fibers yielded an ultimate tensile strength of 101.03MPa and a flexural strength of 153.43MPa . 
3 Four-Dimensional printing of active Polymer-Fiber composites Addition of fiber in 3D printed polymers is not always for improving the mechanical properties . 
Fibers , as well other additives , are also used in manufacturing of smart composites , to control the structure transformation . 
This implementation in 3D printing opened a new field called 4D printing . 
4D printing refers to a multi-material printing with the ability to transform over time or change its shape after the printing . 
These structures can be programmable and transformed from one or two dimensional structures to 3D objects . 
Recent advances in AM made precise placement of material at micro-scale during 3D printing of complex structures possible . 
This allows implementing programmable and computational material in AM in order to control the shape of the material after printing . 
These materials can change their shape under light , temperature change , or immersion into a solvent . 
3D printing technology has enabled active material to achieve an even higher complexity and accuracy . 
Fiber additives play an important role in 4D printing ; controlling the fiber alignment allows programmable transformation , right out of the printing bed . 
Ge , Qi developed a method to print thermomechanically programmable composites with complex shapes . 
The matrix and fibers used were an elastomer and a glassy polymer , with tailored thermomechanical behavior , respectively . 
21 demonstrates the process in which the inkjet deposited material on the bed , prior to photopolymerization of the film by UV light , forms a layer . 
Gladman , Matsumoto printed plant-inspired architectures , with a hydrogel composite ink , composed of stiff cellulose fibrils embedded in a soft acrylamide matrix . 
Alignment of cellulose fibrils controlled the swelling of the 3D printed part upon immersion in water . 
These structures are programmable based on the printing direction and orientation of embedded cellulose fibrils inside the structure . 
4 Modeling and analytical techniques Polymer-fiber composites produced by AM can be analyzed using existing theories based on the manufacturing technique and the reinforcement type . 
Existing macro and micro mechanical modelling techniques can be applied to AM with slight modifications . 
Microstructure of 3D printed parts often differ from those prepared by traditional manufacturing methods and with the immerging of new AM methods , there is a demand for modelling and analysis of these structures . 
4.1 Short fiber composite theories There are several theories for predicting the properties of short fiber composites . 
Depending on their assumptions , they can be applied to various 3D printing methods . 
Fibers alignment , shape , length , and its bonding with the matrix are crucial in accuracy of the modelling . 
The modified rule of mixtures is the simplest method to predict the tensile properties of short fiber composites , by assuming perfect fiberinterfacial bonding . 
MROM is given by cu = 1 2 V f fu + V m m where 1 2 is fiber efficiency factor for the strength of the composite , in which , 1 and 2 are the fiber orientation and fiber length factors , respectively ; cu and fu are ultimate strength of the composite and fiber , respectively ; V f and V m represent the volume fraction of the fiber and matrix ; and m is the matrix stress at the composite failure . 
If the fiber length is equal to L and uniform , fiber orientation factor is equal to 1 and fiber length factor is given by the critical fiber length , r f is fiber radius , and i is interfacial shear stress between matrix and fibers . 
In order to consider the effect of fiber orientation and non-uniform fiber length in the model , 1 and 2 should be modified . 
Modified Kelly and Tyson model proposed for fibers shorter and longer than the critical fiber length with considering fiber orientation , as follows . 
However , fiber orientation factor 1 in this model is fitted empirically . 
Fu and Lauke used two probability density functions for modelling the fiber length and fiber orientation distributions with the intention of predicting the elastic properties . 
There are various theories for predicting the stiffness properties of short-fiber composites . 
The Morimodel is another well-known theory that considers a non-dilute composite containing many identical spheroidal particles . 
It is assumed that the composite experiences an average stress different from that of the applied stress . 
Longitudinal and transverse elastic moduli in Morimodel are where V f is the volume fraction of filler and m is the Poissonratio of the matrix ; A1 , A2 , A3 , A4 , A5 , and A are functions of the Eshelbytensor and the properties of the fiber and the matrix , with more explanation given in . 
In theory , the aforementioned equations for short fiber composites , can be used to model 3D printed parts , however , length and orientation of the fibers used in the process should match the assumptions . 
FDM , SLS , and extrusion with short fiber reinforcement can be modeled with these analytical methods . 
However , 3D printed parts often contain considerable fraction of void content and modifications may be necessary when applying these methods on additive manufacturing . 
Void in composite materials are comprehensively explained in . 
4.2 Classical laminate plate theory CLPT is an extension of the classical plate theory for isotropic and homogeneous materials with some modifications to reflect the inhomogeneity of orthotropic materials in thickness direction . 
CLTP is applicable to all 3D printed parts that exhibit orthogonal behavior . 
Here , we present a brief summary of CLPT for laminated plates consisting of multiple unidirectional laminae . 
The stiffness matrix of each ply can be described as . 
Transformed reduced stiffness matrix for various fiber orientation can be computed using transformation matrix as follow , and is the angle of the fiber reinforcement . 
Then , in-plane , coupling , and bending stiffness matrices can be obtained by , respectively where z represents the vertical position in the ply from the midplane . 
Finally , we can write a connection between the applied loads and the associated strains in the laminate , as follows , N M = A B B D 0 where N is normal stress resultants , M is moment resultants , 0 represent strain term in midplane , and is the twist of the laminated plate . 
The strain along the plate thickness can be given by , x y xy = x 0 y 0 xy 0 + z x y xy Additionally , by using the same principle , CLPT can be applied to evaluate the strength and elastic constants of FDM printed parts with void content . 
As mentioned earlier , FDM process is associated with void formation between printing beads , which needs to be considered in the modeling . 
In the method developed by Rodriguez , Thomas for ABS materials , The FDM part is defined as an unidirectional ABScomposite with a laminate structure . 
This structure is consisting of vertically stacked layers with contiguous material and voids . 
The unidirectional elastic constants are given as and represent the elastic modulus , shear modulus and Poissonratio of the extruded polymer used in the FDM process . 
The 1 is the area void density in the plane normal to filament direction . 
This method was used in various works for single material FDM parts containing void , however , certain modifications are needed in order to apply it to multi-material 3D printing . 
More information regarding void in composite structures can be found in . 
4.3 Finite element method FEM is particularly interesting for modelling 3D printed part due to its flexibility in analyzing complex geometries in both macro and micro scale . 
It can be applied to continuous and short fiber 3D printed composites . 
The primary distinction of most composites by AM is the significant void content that needs to be incorporated into the respective finite element model . 
Perhaps the most appealing approaches for mechanical modelling of fiber composites are homogenization , which was described briefly in CLPT , and unit-cell based methods . 
Both approaches can be implemented in FEM , thus , applicable to all AM methods . 
Conversely , there has been a lack of attention to modelling of these processes , and with increasing the popularity of 3D printing among practitioners , the need for simulation of the 3D printing process is certain . 
UC is a single or multiple fibers embedded in the matrix with the volume fraction similar to those of the composite . 
A finite element model of this geometry using two different materials is constructed and various loadings are applied to characterize the behavior of the UC . 
In the case of composites with random fiber orientations the composite behavior is approximated by direct averaging over all orientations . 
Unit cells depend upon the microstructure of the composite ; some common types of unite cell are presented in 24 . 
24 presents a UC for discontinuous short fiber composites with random orientations , 24 and shows UC for continuous fiber reinforced with unidirectional orientation and 3D braided structure , respectively . 
Another commonly used approach is multiscale methods by combining micro level and homogenized macro stress analysis . 
Microscopic level analysis can increase the accuracy , but are often too expensive to be used in practice . 
Multiscale modelling takes advantage of the efficiency of macroscopic models and the accuracy of the microscopic models . 
The microscope analysis is normally performed at the area of interest with high stress concentration .

5 Conclusions 3D printing of composite structures can be a turning point for AM technology . 
The potential of fabricating functional devices , directly from commercial 3D printers with controllable properties , created a huge rush for new developments and research in this field . 
The attractive combination of endless possibilities in the range of composite materials and extra customization of AM offers a unique new area in the manufacturing field , for researchers and developers to explore . 
AM of composites enables precise control of the physical , electrochemical , thermal , and optical properties ; these structures can even transform their shape over time in 4D printing . 
Fiber reinforcement significantly improves the mechanical properties of 3D printed parts . 
It can be implemented in various AM techniques , such as FDM , SLA , SLS , LOM , and extrusion . 
Printed CF-ABS composites were even reported with higher specific strength than Aluminum . 
The alignment of fibers in 3D printing of composites was one of the major challenges in the reviewed literature and its improvement attracted tremendous research interest in almost all of the existing AM methods . 
Recent advances in FDM printing of continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastics took these improvements one step further to establish AM as a dependable manufacturing method for various industries . 
In one of the interesting and innovative developments , continuous carbon fiber and PLA were mixed in the printing head before depositing into the printing bed , increasing the fiber/matrix adhesion . 
Laser assisted AM for continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic composites demonstrates superior mechanical properties and at the mean time solves the issue of material waste for LOM . 
Furthermore , developments in 3D printing of fiber reinforced composite structures allowed precise placement of material at micro-scale , to fabricate complex structures in 4D printing of active composites , with ability to transform over time , right after the 3D printing . 
However , most 3D printing methodologies for composite materials still face major challenges , which need to be overcome before becoming a mainstream manufacturing method . 
Void formation during printing , poor adhesion of fibers and polymer matrix , and challenges in continuous fiber printing are all amongst the existing issues in 3D printing of fiber composites . 
Moreover , most of the commercial 3D printers designed for specific resins and introduction of fillers can lead to blockage , wear , non-adhesion , and increased curing times . 
AM of composites is a relatively new technique and there is a lack of research on modelling the structures produced by this process . 
Existing theories for short and continuous fiber composites can be modified for 3D printed parts . 
On the other hand , FEM is a powerful tool to analyze composite structures , and it can be applied for 3D printing with slight modifications of existing finite element models . 
In conclusion , AM of fiber reinforced polymer composites is tremendously promising in turning 3D printing from a prototyping method to a robust manufacturing technique . 
The unique characteristics of 3D printing , such as high customization , combined with extra strength from fiber reinforcement and the ability to produce functional complex 3D structures with total control over material properties , helped AM of fiber-polymer composites gain enormous attention from a broad range of science industries . 
The aerospace industry , automotive industry , biomedical science , electronic industries , and robotics are only a few examples of those attracted by AM of fiber reinforced polymer composites . 
As the application of additive manufacturing reaches an unprecedented scale in both academia and industry , a reflection upon the state-of-the-art developments in the design for additive manufacturing and structural optimisation , becomes vital for successfully shaping the future AM-landscape . 
A framework , highlighting both the interdependencies between these two central aspects in AM and the necessity for a holistic approach to structural optimization , using lightweight strategies such as topology optimization and/or latticing , was established to summarize the reviewed content . 
Primarily focusing on isotropic material considerations and basic stiffness-optimal problems , these concepts have already found wide application , bridging the gaps between design and manufacturing as well as academia and industry . 
In pursuit of streamlining the AM-workflow towards digitally print-ready designs , studies are increasingly investigating mathematically-based structural optimization approaches in conjunction with DfAM-specific constraints , providing a portfolio of solutions like generative design , which is gaining traction in industry . 
Besides an overview on economically-driven to performance-driven design optimizations , insight into commercial AM-specific software is provided , elucidating potentials and challenges for the community .

Consolidated summary , elucidating the gaps between design and manufacturing as well as academia and industry . 
Establishment of a design for AM framework , highlighting the interdependencies between state-of-the art research topics . 
Additive manufacturing , also referred to as 3D-printing , has evolved greatly over the last three decades , emerging from the mere application in prototyping , it has now indisputably established its position as a viable fabrication alternative for end-use parts . 
This applies to a wide range of industries , including medical engineering , automotive , aerospace and consumer products , . 
lower energy consumption , has driven the research into identifying lightweight and robust designs . 
Topology optimisation and latticing have emerged as the two major lightweighting strategies , best exploiting the design freedoms offered by AM . 
The former represents a rigorous approach , improving the specific stiffness , whereas the latter can be considered as a design approach for weight-reduction in parts that usually have a high safety factor , which has in fact been widely adopted as a common design practice in today 's AM-specific software . 
multifunctionality and bio-inspired designs , are gaining interest and could help shape the future of structurally advanced AM-parts . 
This development is supported by the steady improvements in printer hardware and AM-specific software as well as the enrichment of the available material palette . 
In fact , AM is attributed a central role in the successful realization of the new industrial revolution , i.e . 
Industry 4.0 , affecting both the way we design and fabricate . 
This is clearly reflected by the prediction of a threefold increase in the industry 's market value as stated in the Wohlers report . 
Jiang envisage among others intensified manufacturing of both critical and non-critical spare parts as well as increased customization of products with AM , which will require improvements in the structural performance and adequate design practices , respectively . 
From a design and structural standpoint , reviews in AM have so far focused on either the development of design rules and frameworks in the context of DfAM or the role of e.g . 
TO , latticing , processing parameters , materials and bio-inspired approaches , respectively . 
Herein , a joint scope including a much wider consideration for DfAM in structural optimization for AM is captured , reviewing two key lightweighting strategies in AM , namely TO and latticing and providing insight into the academic versus the commercial landscape . 
1 introduces a framework , relating key intrinsic and extrinsic DfAM aspects that were identified in the field of design and structural optimisation for AM . 
An intrinsic aspect is , therefore , representing the primary drivers when designing for AM , whereas the extrinsic factors can be regarded as current research topics in design and structural optimization for AM . 
The remit of this paper , however , goes beyond this framework , highlighting the underlying dependencies between the individual extrinsic factors in the state-of-the-art research today . 
Three interrelated themes referred to as entail process- and material-induced aspects , lightweighting strategies as well as broader DfAM-factors and are arranged analogously to the chronological order of headings in this paper . 
This review focuses on structural optimisation in AM with particular emphasis on DfAM . 
As most works on lightweighting strategies are based on isotropic material assumptions , reinforced-materials and the process-induced anisotropy caused by the fabrication in a layer-by-layer fashion or infill pattern , are not assessed . 
As the role of anisotropy for topology optimisation in AM was discussed in , elucidating that this research is still in its infancy and requiring more fundamental investigations for a critical review , this paper summarizes the more consolidated knowledge in this field . 
A DfAM framework , encapsulating intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of the cutting-edge research on AM-friendly structural optimisation , preludes the main part of this work and provides context and structure to the reviewed studies . 
The joint focus on structural optimisation in AM using TO and latticing with incorporation of DfAM aspects constitutes the remit of this paper . 
Secondly , the synergistic and expertise-dominated application of cellular structures , as design approach to lightweighting , will be addressed . 
Hereby , focus is put on their application and significance in standard engineering problems rather than the medical field , as reviewed elsewhere . 
Moreover , it is important to note that the reviewed works are primarily looking into basic structural problems , concentrating on improved stiffness under volume constraints . 
2 Structural optimisation with isotropic material in AM The role of structural optimisation in AM is increasing across industries with lightweighting strategies that can broadly be differentiated into mathematically-driven and expertise-driven , with recent studies seeing increased utilization of both . 
Here , TO is frequently adopted for the design of structurally-sound AM-parts and has meanwhile surpassed the use of shape and size optimization in isolation . 
However , it has become a general practice in commercial software to post-process TO-solutions by optimizing the size or shape of the final structure to adhere e.g . 
to minimum feature sizes that match the resolution of the printer . 
In contrast , expertise-driven structural optimisation such as latticing is not a lightweighting strategy per se , as stiffness is greatly compromised in exchange for e.g . 
A good example of this is the latticing of a part for weight reductions and enhanced functionality in areas where stiffness can be sacrificed . 
Generative design formally merges these two schemes through a parallel implementation to provide a portfolio of solutions i.e . 
1 Topology optimisation in AM Bendsand Kikuchi 's as well as Sigmund 's landmark work , introducing the concept of shape and TO centred on the homogenization approach and the MATLAB implementation of a density-based TO , respectively , laid the foundation for today 's TO-methods . 
The most prominent TO approaches can be summarized as follows : Density-based ; Level Set ; Evolutionary/Genetic Algorithms ; Topological Derivatives and Phase Field . 
Discrete TO can be described as a method that explores the optimal connection of the elements , whereas continuum TO determines the optimal spatial distribution of material within a domain . 
At the core of each structural TO problem lies an objective function that needs to be minimized or maximized while being subjected to a set of constraints such as volume , displacement or frequency . 
As part of an iterative process , in methods utilizing density as a design variable , Finite Element Analysis , sensitivity analysis , regularizations and optimisation steps are repeated in this order until convergence is achieved . 
In the context of DfAM , research today is geared towards print-ready TO designs bridging challenges of design and fabrication . 
This refers to methods that change the numerically optimal solution either intrinsically through the imposition of manufacturing constraints or in subsequent post-processing steps which alter the geometrical layout . 
Support-free designs and strategies to reduce the support volume are facilitators for a time- and cost-efficient fabrication . 
In pursuit of both physically and digitally print-ready designs , smooth boundary representations have drawn great attention in recent years . 
In this review , this refers to mesh-refinements , ensuring a better surface representation or CAD-friendly geometries . 
In this context , correct digitalizing of TO-solutions will be pivotal for future CAD/CAM software , including an automated design procedure that integrates DfAM considerations and requires less AM-expertise . 
Emerging TO methods with DfAM consideration for smooth boundary representation include the Development Method and the Morphable Method . 
Herein , basic geometric shapes and polygons , capturing the geometrical layouts , have served as simple design primitives for representing topologies . 
1 SIMP-based designs for AM Density-based TO methods are most prevalent in academia and follow the general procedure . 
A well-established continuum method often referred to as the SIMP approach , first introduced by Bends , relates the elements relative densities to the effective material moduli using the power law . 
As most works use linear elastic assumptions with the standard density-based TO approaches , they lack the ability to solve problems with large deformations accurately . 
However , regarding DfAM , designs with elastoplastic print consumables , as commonly used , could particularly benefit from more realistic material considerations . 
Major findings in studies on non-linear TO include : 1 ) the difference between linear and non-linear modelling of large deformations is particularly evident in buckling and snap-through scenarios ; 2 ) a non-linear analysis made insignificant changes to the stiffness/compliance of a linear elastic structure but altered the topology significantly ; 3 ) non-linearity assumptions are beneficial for realizing compliant mechanisms ; 4 ) issues with excessive distortions or convergence of the numerical model can be solved . 
1 Academic approaches to structurally optimized AM-friendly parts With the maturation of TO-codes in recent years towards greater computational efficiency and complexity , the inclusion of DfAM aspects is on the rise . 
Most of today 's research on TO for AM is economically-driven and deals with support volume reduction , their complete elimination or simplified removal . 
Support-free structures with reasonably good quality can generally be expected for an inclination angle in the realm of 45 , which has been widely adopted for structural optimization problems anything lower is associated with additional fabrication cost motivating efforts in achieving conformity between design and print . 
However , it should be noted that fine-tuning of process parameters in polymer FDM has shown to allow even lower print-angles . 
Performance is inevitably compromised by imposing manufacturing constraints but opposed to accounting for support volume , performance-driven factors in TO methods , including e.g . 
In , the performance and printability of a structure derived from a coupled truss and SIMP-based optimisation approach were investigated . 
By projecting a truss framework onto the corresponding TO-solution , the material was re-distributed , promoting adherence to overhang angle limits . 
As a result , a topology that does require less support but has reasonably high performance was created . 
Additionally , it was found that the printing direction is a key control parameter between manufacturability and performance . 
An efficient DfAM filter for TO , avoiding support structures , has also been the subject of research in the works of Langelaar , in which a projection method was proposed for 2D and 3D cases . 
More recently , Langelaar has extended this AM-filter approach to a method for optimizing topology , support layout and build orientation simultaneously , providing designers and engineers with a portfolio of results with the corresponding fabrication cost and part performance . 
The support-filter itself is based on the premise of a layer-wise AM fabrication , whereby it is examined whether the base elements in the underlying layer offer support considering the critical support-free inclination angle of 45Together with a sensitivity filter based on the adjoint method , the AM-filter formulation is integrated into the code of Andreassen , making it an easily accessible tool for print-ready AM-parts with improved structural performance . 
Numerical examples provided in illustrated the printability of TO-structures as a function of printing orientation . 
a half MBB beam , Langelaar highlighted not only the effectiveness of the filter to avoid shallow angles and its effect on the final topology compared to the unconstrained model , but also the variation in compliance with the building orientation . 
An extension of this method could potentially be promising for multidirectional slicing in robotic AM . 
Gaynor and co-workers as well as Qian , showed that the Heaviside Projection offered an alternative means to constraining the overhang angles in TO-solutions . 
In this scheme was employed to enforce a binary solution from the greyscale SIMP-solution by controlling the minimum radial length scale . 
determine the minimum self-supporting angle in 2D . 
Gaynor and Guest found major changes in the topology and deterioration in performance with increasing self-supporting angles . 
In the Heaviside Projection was employed both on the density and the density gradient to obtain well-defined boundaries and constrain the perimeter length in undercuts and overhangs for 3D cases . 
improved convergence to a discrete solution . 
As an example , a cantilever beam was optimized for individual minimum overhang angles , illustrating that overhang angle and gradient constraint need to be concurrently changed and that the compliance is significantly increased over the unconstrained pendant , especially for increased overhang angles . 
Leary proposed an approach in which infeasible inclination angles are initially identified , followed by a layout transmission into a support-free design and the determination of the optimal building orientation . 
Firstly , a binary topology was obtained through thresholding of the gradient values to identify the perimeters and its local gradients . 
Subsequently , smoothing of the boundary was performed using the rolling average method . 
The actual novelties are the iterative internal and external boundary modifications centred on a recursive subdivision of domains to ensure the final design complies with the allowable inclination angle . 
The change in the geometrical layout increased the volume fraction of the part , however , due to the avoidance of support , experimental results showed a reduction in fabrication time . 
Benchmarking against standard TO result , numerical analyses showcased : a ) different stress distributions while the maximum von Mises stress stayed constant and b ) the heat transfer is increased , which is of particular interest for e.g . 
metal-AM , as entrapment of excessive temperature , leads to microstructural changes over time as shown by . 
It is important to note , however , that a weight increase is associated with this method , which should be carefully weighed against the material savings achieved by avoiding the supports or the ease in manufacturing . 
In contrast , a more recent paper by Thore investigates the abovementioned factor of stresses in support-free TO-solutions , while adhering to the volume constraint , linking economy and fabrication . 
Contrary to the above works , digitally print-ready designs , accounting for research that highlight efforts to facilitate the transition between design and print such as methods that require minimal post-processing to be manufacture-ready are gaining interest . 
Interpreting density-based TO solutions , even when they are discrete , poses a bottleneck for post-processes such as shape optimisation or the use of CAD programs for the conversion into AM-compatible file formats . 
A smooth boundary representation is , therefore , an aspect of particular attention in the context of TO . 
An approach which is post-processing the layout of a TO-solution was recently presented by Liu . 
Here , a multi-step transformation method from a greyscale SIMP-based solution into STL and IGES formats has been presented . 
It is comprised of : 1 ) density thresholding and mesh refinement ; 2 ) skeletonisation ; 3 ) identify small features and increase their elemental density ; 4 ) density filtering ; 5 ) density thresholding while preserving volume fraction ; 6 ) create STL file utilizing ; 7 ) boundary interpretation using spline fitting ; 8 ) obtain IGES file from an in-build MATLAB function . 
Shape optimisations procedures using a CAD model were shown to be suitable with designs obtained from the adaptive boundary fitting method due to its smooth boundaries . 
Studies like this represent a key element in today 's research from DfAM , namely the transformation of complex AM-designs into CAD/CAM environments . 
2 Commercial software implementations for lightweight structures Promoted by the greater application of TO in industry , an increased range of software providers have emerged , maturing and facilitating access to ready-to-use tools . 
Particularly TO software providing greater freedom in utilizing subroutines , as recently demonstrated in , present a promising platform for further innovations in this field . 
on automotive components like an upright . 
In , significant weight savings of one to two-thirds were achieved while ensuring the same structural performance as the original parts . 
In , shape controls ensured control over the member size , accounting for the minimum resolution of the electron beam melting process for a successful print . 
It was observed , that all considered factors were closely related to the amount of support material used , as it increased the fabrication time and cost . 
From the above study , it can be concluded that the layout of the final design for the industrial sector will be the result of multi-objective considerations , specifically drawing attention to the performance-economy relation with the utilized print materials . 
This highlights the importance of a DfAM framework that assures correct weighting of the relevant parameters and provides similar to the generative design a portfolio of quantifiable geometrical solutions . 
The optimisation of a heat sink design displayed the software 's capabilities to deal with multi-objective optimisation , as the design variables included friction force , thermal conductivity and out-of-plane heat transfer , besides the density of the elements . 
Despite showcasing the theoretical capabilities of today 's TO-software , the above-mentioned studies commonly lack experimental verification . 
Generally , numerical examples in TO involve either cantilever , half MBB or full MBB beams , but there is no explicit agreement by the scientific community on their aspect ratio , making comparisons difficult . 
From a practical standpoint , standardised flexure tests would be better suited for experimental verification and therefore aid the comparison between both the TO-models and their physical counterparts . 
3 Advanced applications TO-designs are increasingly adopted in technologically advanced industries as AM hardware and software are maturing , making complexity and scalability of AM-parts more tangible . 
Recent case-studies on topologically optimized engine pistons or car chassis indeed showed a promising development for increased uptake of TO in the automotive sector . 
As an example , Aage looked into optimizing the wing structure of a Boeing 777 using high-performance computing to overcome current limitations regarding the number of resolvable voxels and representable feature size . 
However , this should not distract from the more pressing challenge the AM-community is currently faced to further exploit AM capabilities , namely the reduction of the computational cost and improvement of the resolution for standard engineering problems . 
In case of small- and mid-sized companies these are commonly solved with standard desktop machines rather than employing high-performance computing . 
the fruition of compliant mechanisms , realized by means of multi-material printers and the use of materials with greatly varying Poisson 's ratios . 
2 AM-designs derived from evolutionary TO Evolutionary algorithms have been used and constantly improved for structural optimisation over the last two decades . 
The most prominent representative is BESO , introduced by Yang as an extension to the Evolutionary Structural Optimisation method put forward by Xie and Stevens . 
However , issues related to stepped contours i.e . 
smooth boundaries remain . 
1 Digitally print-ready designs In light of DfAM , achieving a smooth boundary representation , especially for discrete TO-solutions , is currently a subject of intense study . 
Capitalizing on the shape functions , a smoother boundary , accounting for discontinuous material distributions within single FEs , was realized . 
Despite revealing the same overall topology , the Iso-XFEM method provided a superior structural stiffness as compared to the BESO implementation for the same amount of iterations and identical mesh-size . 
BESO with a finer initial fixed mesh matched the performance but at a computational expense . 
As the mesh manipulation is outweighing the computational benefit of BESO , the AM-friendly Iso-XFEM method was regarded as the preferential TO method , streamlining the design process towards digitally-print-ready models and effectively tying in aspects of lightweighting and boundary representation . 
In a more recent study , Iso-XFEM was applied as a design-procedure to obtain a lightweight brake pedal . 
The structure was effectively enhanced for AM , using a manual post-processing step , in which a partial cellular infill based on Body Centred Cubic unit cells was included to improve the performance under arbitrary loading and to reduce warpage arising from residual stresses in SLM . 
In , a modified BESO method was used to optimize the strut thickness of lattices used in an engine bracket , to improve the compliance over a homogenous design . 
The material allocation is conducted based on the ratio between the local and global stress magnitude i.e . 
the stress distribution as well as the predefined strut diameter bounds . 
compliant mechanisms , a modified BESO with local displacement constraints was employed by Zuo and Xie . 
Here , the standard penalization factor was introduced for the material interpolation and to ensure convergence , however , for the FEA several critical nodes were assigned to local displacement functions based on the individual virtual loads to fine-tune the topology for a specific load case . 
Numerical examples displayed dissimilar topologies compared to the conventional compliance-driven approach and a significant reduction in the maximum vertical deflection . 
As outlined by the authors , this method lends itself for lightweight structures such as an aircraft wing , for which awareness and control over the deformed shape are required . 
For the most part , TO procedures employ fixed meshes for the FEA . 
A mesh refinement captures the material behaviour more accurately , however at higher computational cost due to more degrees of freedom . 
A fine mesh for updating design variable and a hierarchical system for the FEA . 
This resulted in a relatively-smooth topology , due to the finer resolution representing the boundaries of the structure , whereas the size of the internal elements remained coarse . 
It is of note that caution must be taken in choosing an appropriate value for the maximum element size to obtain accurate FEA results . 
3 Level set TO for AM Level set method centre around the structural boundaries i.e . 
interfaces and their implicit representation via iso-contours of the corresponding level set function . 
The inherently smooth and well-defined boundaries obtained lend themselves for parameterization into geometric shapes , potentially linking aspects of manufacturing and digitalization . 
However , for analysis , the geometrical model is mostly discretized and mapped onto a fixed mesh , following the density-based methods . 
For instance , by embracing both economic and performance-driven DfAM considerations , Liu and co-workers have developed a feature-based approach as well as algorithms that take into account the deposition path/building direction and support-free manufacturing . 
Regarding DfAM studies have shown that gaps between paths due to sharp angle changes can be avoided and as the paths follow the principal stress trajectories , the overall performance can be increased . 
In , the contour offset method and the structural skeleton based method , including a support structure constraint , were investigated . 
It was found that the structural performance was comparable between both methods , whereas , the skeleton-based method was favourable as it avoided manufacturing irregularities . 
The authors optimized a cantilever beam for self-supported AM , using a multi-LS interpolation approach , to illustrate their method . 
Similarly , the skeletonisation of 2D LS topologies was utilized in to constrain the minimum hole size and control the number of holes in the topology to ensure better manufacturability . 
In , it was applied to avoid small struts by controlling the minimum or maximum length scale of the features i.e . 
the distance between skeleton and boundary . 
8b illustrates the difference in topology between constraint and unconstraint LS TO of a cantilever beam . 
In the study of Allaire , the aspect of the overhang constraint was considered from two perspectives . 
The latter has been developed in and centres on the intermediate AM stages , resulting in the continuous change in shape and boundary conditions with each consecutive layer . 
the cooling rate as another fabrication constraint for this minimum compliance problem . 
Likewise , in , Mart accounted for process-induced effects , such as porosity in parts created from electron beam melting . 
Considering fabrication-stages and -flaws for different AM-processes is certainly representing a more interconnected and realistic application of DfAM , encompassing intrinsic and extrinsic factors , shared in the upper and middle band , and contributing to higher quality AM-parts in the future . 
Certain design requirements like fixed passive elements or other functional affiliations often do not allow support-free angles . 
Mirzendehdel and Suresh reduced the support volume of topologically optimized structures using an LS based Pareto TO , considering both support structure and topological sensitivities through dynamic weighting . 
Similar attempts to reduce support volume include tree-like and topologically optimized supports . 
2 Cellular structures in AM Cellular structures represent an important structural design feature in AM , commonly used for lightweighting . 
Characterized by slender/thin members , such as struts/bars or sheets/plates , these formations are increasingly utilized as an integral feature in AM-designs primarily due to material and time-/energy-saving in fabrication as well as improvements in strength-to-weight ratio , as summarized in . 
Besides the specific strength , their ability to dissipate energy , heat and vibration add value to the design . 
Recently , a significant increase in buckling load and buckling strength have been recorded by using triangular lattice-infills or topology optimized hierarchical microstructures , respectively . 
In metal-AM , they can also help mitigate warpage , arising from process-induced residual stresses , however , some lattice types must be altered to accommodate for e.g . 
The use of lattices , contrary to the common misconception , is therefore not a lightweighting approach from a pure stiffness standpoint , which needs to be considered in the design process . 
An overview from design to analysis of cellular structures for AM can be extracted from . 
Unit cells represent the building blocks of a lattice , which is generated either from sweeping , meshing/mapping , tessellation to obtain a regular pattern or stochastically yielding unstructured formations , which is often achieved via techniques such as dithering . 
Unit cells are generally classified into truss based and surface-based . 
Numerous cell topologies were generatively developed over the years , leading to the emergence of unit cell libraries/families for AM . 
Ground trusses , often resembling lattice-like configurations , are characterized by a freeform frame-network with locally varying strut diameters which also lends themselves well for AM . 
It is however of note , that isotropic open-cell truss-like structures have an up to threefold inferior stiffness performance compared to their closed-cell lattice counterparts of the same relative density . 
On this account , considering that lattices are not stiffness-optimal and given the choice , surface-based unit cells should be favoured for lightweight designs . 
Unit cell tessellation approaches often give rise to non-conformity as loose-hanging members are formed when a lattice is created , impairing the structural performance . 
Lattices derived from tessellated surface-based unit cells are less affected by this phenomenon . 
On the contrary , conformal lattices were found to yield greater structural performance . 
Works on graded lattices most generally focus on piecewise variation in volume fractions that change from one unit cell to another . 
However , due to the implicit definition of triply periodic minimal surface lattices , true functional grading is achievable with ease . 
Together with the advancement in hardware technology , capable of fine- and multi-scale structures , these new lightweight lattice structures with locally changing material properties represent a unique offering of AM . 
Discrepancies between the ideal and the actual performance of lattices , reviewed in , is owed to irregularities introduced during manufacturing , which include micro-voids or the change in surface roughness , making the prediction of the mechanical performance based on the relative density and linear elastic assumptions difficult . 
A comparison between the experimental and numerical analyses of lattices and a summary of simulation methods are summarized in . 
Latticing tools are increasingly provided in today 's CAD software and are commonly used to substitute low-stress areas for weight reduction . 
Particularly the ability to achieve a balance between robustness and compliance in tailored lattices was recently stressed . 
Another emerging research field in AM , aiming - among others - at combing high strength and stiffness , is biomimicry . 
Moreover , it is of note , that some software providers like ELiSE are already incorporating bionic templates into designs geared towards AM . 
1 Topologically optimized lattices based on academic codes Promising academic approaches dealing with structural optimisation of lattices for AM are on the uprise . 
The digitalisation of these intricate structures is a prerequisite to ensure optimisation , bridge the gap to manufacturing and ultimately improve the structural performance of lightweight AM-parts . 
Computationally efficient representation of lattices is as challenging as it is important for the analysis and manufacturing steps . 
As a consequence , research is actively looking into ways to reduce the computational expense , aiding streamline the design process and enabling geometrical layouts , such as functionally graded lattices . 
1 Structurally optimized lattices using the homogenization method To capture the heterogeneous nature of lattices , unit cells are commonly homogenized into representative volume elements . 
Homogenization-based methods have recently been integrated into a lattice mesostructural optimisation framework for AM . 
In , Messner presented the inverse homogenization , in which the macrostructural material properties of a periodic lattice consisting of simple unit cells are combined with a subsequent parameterization to obtain a 3D truss-like lattice structure with struts of round cross-sections and isotropic material behaviour . 
In the context of digital AM , it is worth mentioning , that such a parameterization of the design space is beneficial for better control over the geometrical layout using CAD-like environments and therefore bridging the gap between important intrinsic DfAM aspects . 
2 Graded lattices derived from mapping combined with density-based TO Various studies have utilized a mapping approach to update a cellular structure based on the density values obtained from unpenalized TO . 
Some of these use the abovementioned homogenization approach to map the unit cells achieving a more accurate mechanical response . 
In , a SIMP-solution provides the density distribution , which is mapped onto the explicit cellular structure , leading to the newly density-adjusted structure . 
In an FEA of a beam under three-point bending it was determined that the stiffness of the explicit cellular model increased with greater gradient density and lower cell size , approaching the implicit i.e . 
Great reliability of the numerical model was concluded after negligible differences in performance were obtained in comparison with the specimens created from SLA . 
An increase in stiffness by more than a third over the uniform lattice was revealed in the experiment , highlighting a viable design approach for structurally enhanced AM-parts . 
The dependence between cell size and performance elucidates the need for high-precision , fine-scale manufacturing in future work . 
Manufacturing of extruded 2D lattices is straightforward for most printing technologies , however , 3D cellular structures can pose a challenge for e.g . 
powder-based processes , as unconsolidated material is easily encapsulated in cavities . 
This was taken into consideration by Jin through manufacturing constraints such as the minimum section thickness , the minimum hole diameter and the uniformity of the section thickness i.e . 
The authors mapped the lattice of square cell honeycombs onto the density matrix of the TO-solution . 
The FEA reveals superior compressive performance of the developed graded lattice even with the manufacturing constraints over the uniform lattice . 
Similar to , the authors found that a decreasing cell size and an increasing gradient density has a positive effect on the structural performance . 
Song expanded the concept to irregularly shaped cells for AM . 
Here , a triangular mesh , obtained from a domain of unit tangent circles , is the basis for the formation of the cellular structure with predetermined cell/circle ratios . 
This irregular lattice is then mapped onto the density field obtained from unpenalized SIMP . 
Experimental tests showed that the irregular cell structure obtained from the unpenalized SIMP outperformed those using penalization . 
Mapping strut-based unit cells with different densities into a hexahedral mesh of a topologically optimized structure enabled Robbins to create structures with an external topology based on the penalized SIMP-result filled with a conformal lattice with properties determined from the homogenization method . 
The meshing was done with the Sandia 's Sculpt tool , allowing for the adaption and smoothing of the mesh at the boundaries , aiding the creation of a flawless and print-ready STL files . 
To guarantee the same weight of structures with various unit cell densities , the external topology was adapted accordingly , revealing an improved performance for less dense lattices . 
Even though the structure was printed using laser power bed fusion of stainless steel , no experimental verification was conducted , which is a recurring shortcoming in many of the reviewed studies on structural optimisation using either TO or lattices . 
While all the aforementioned studies solely focused on the performance aspects of the mapped structures , Panesar took also aspects of design and manufacturability into account . 
Hereby investigating intersected , scaled and graded lattices with strut- and surface-based self-supporting unit cells for design aspect like structural optimality , design effort , support requirements , robustness i.e . 
resilience to variation in loading and design-to-manufacturing discrepancy . 
The authors used a voxel paradigm , rather than the traditional volume boundary representation via B-rep , to represent lattices and employed an iso-value matrix , similar to , for functional grading . 
purely topologically optimized result . 
Authors highlighted the superiority of the proposed lattice types in terms of specific stiffness over the uniform lattice and the robustness of the graded lattice making it the most well-rounded performing lattice . 
Particularly , the lattices comprised of surface-based unit cells were found to result in more resilient structures . 
However , from a performance i.e . 
stiffness perspective , all lattices perform inferior compared to the solid pendant . 
Moreover , the cellular structures reduced the support structure requirements compared to the solid design . 
Similar to , the voxel-based method of Aremeu employs a net-skin approach , ensuring conformal lattices despite tessellation , through re-connecting strut-members at the boundary . 
The authors believe , that due to the limited resolvable resolution of AM machines , this method would satisfy the level of detail required for the model without high computational cost and geometrical complexity , however , no numerical nor experimental verification was conducted in this study . 
More recently Wang have topologically optimized a strut-based Kagome lattice structure based on the SIMP method with direct AM considerations . 
The novelty is that it represents a structure-based rather than a boundary-based TO and constitutes a method to increase the specific stiffness of the primitive unit cell . 
In an attempt to fine-tune the structural response of lattices , Maskery have recently observed a sequential failure of piece-wise graded BCC lattices in compression promoting increased energy absorption in comparison to the ungraded lattice . 
Furthermore , the results indicated non-homogeneous bulk properties , making the use of Gibson-Ashby models inadequate , as they are developed for uniform density lattices . 
It is important to note however , that this model is still useful for obtaining ballpark values for lattices through simple calculations . 
Due to the very specific failure mechanisms in graded lattices , future work ought to put more emphasis on the experimental verification in order to make more reliable predictions for their performance . 
3 Variable-density infills derived from density-based TO An emerging topic in structural optimization with a promising application for AM are TO-based compliance-driven infill strategies for porous material , which account for the principal stress directions imposed by the loading condition . 
Infills derived from homogenization-based TO , using projection-based methods , was subject under investigation in , making designs potentially more feasible for AM through the incorporation of a minimum length scale constraint for the microstructural features matching the print-resolution . 
In , this method was experimentally underpinned , demonstrating how self-supporting variable-density lattices can be generated . 
Work by Wu centres on SIMP , whereby in , solely the infills of 3D structures were optimized and the shell was represented by passive elements , whereas the approach in demonstrated a concurrent optimisation of shell and infill for 2D structures . 
In these structures were separated through multiple successive smoothing and projection steps combined with interpolations of intermediate densities to obtain discrete topologies with checkerboard-free domains and well-defined boundaries . 
In contrast to the standard objective function , a local rather than a global volume constraint was employed in both studies , meaning the density of the neighbouring elements was limited in a predefined radius , controlling the porosity locally . 
It was found , that higher radii result in topologies with coarser pores and greater stiffness as the local volume constraint becomes less influencing . 
Furthermore , Wu emphasized that these control parameters are beneficial for the manufacturability of parts intended for powder-based AM-processes , as closed walls cause entrapments . 
To avoid slender struts without infill , a length scale constraint is introduced in , which was implemented by an erosion and dilation projection before a final sensitivity analysis was conducted . 
Conversely , in , the authors introduce an anisotropic filter , forcing the material to accumulate in preferred i.e . 
a prescribed direction in order to resemble bone-inspired infills , resulting in truss-like formations . 
The filter , in particular , helped improve the uniaxial buckling stability . 
Recently , Wu have presented a computationally more efficient extension to their work that is using a simultaneous optimization of the shape and the distribution of the lattice , demonstrating a twofold increase in buckling load over the equivalent TO-solution . 
Besides weight reductions , improvements in damage tolerance and robustness generally illustrate greater functionality , mechanical capability and versatility of lattices , potentially outweighing the losses in stiffness for certain engineering problems compared to a solid solution . 
Another emerging topic for AM within topologically optimized and variable-density lattices , which will not be further discussed , are both multi-scale and multi-material structures . 
Primary investigations into a concurrent optimization of both macroscale and a micro-scale lattices , using two different materials , show great promise for the design-potential of AM . 
4 Strut-sizing and -scaling for structurally optimized truss-like structures Emerged from the idea to drastically decrease the computational complexity and processing time , the size matching and scaling method for mesoscale lattices , represents an alternative approach for structural optimisation . 
Besides the modification of the topology as certain struts that have a minor contribution to the structural performance are eliminated , the method mainly centres on the size optimisation of the struts . 
An average stress distribution of the solid body serves as the basis upon which the unit cell topology with geometrical features is determined prior to the mapping onto the initial geometry . 
Choosing the exact node size and thresholds for the upper and lower bounds of the strut diameter were deemed to be vital for the assurance of manufacturability with AM . 
Overall this does not take away from its feasibility for application in large structures as shown on the basis of a light-weight micro air vehicle fuselage and is , therefore , a viable alternative to pure TO . 
This method represents a lattice generation tool integrated into Siemens NX CAD software . 
In light of the multifunctional performance of lattices , Seepersad have demonstrated how a post-processing steps can be used to obtain lattice topologies with e.g . 
improved heat transfer , by effectively identifying lattice members that can be sacrificed , based on a hybrid FEA and finite difference approach . 
A more recent study has demonstrated a solution for a similar multifunctional optimization for a heterogeneous cellular structures using a decision support problem formulation . 
5 Evolutionary algorithms for structurally enhanced lattices Tang made use of a BESO-based approach to design a latticed engine bracket with optimal strut thicknesses , using a kernel-based algorithm . 
Points of the boundary and internal elements are subsequently separated , and the initial wireframe is mapped onto the boundary kernel points , followed by a trimming procedure used to remove wires outside the functional volume . 
Finally , these two sets of frames are merged together forming the final conformal lattice , which undergoes the BESO algorithm to modify the strut thickness based on the von Mises stresses obtained from the FEA of the homogenized functional volume and predetermined geometrical limits . 
The structural performance was improved in contrast to a homogeneous lattice and the weight reduced by up to 75 % over the original solid design . 
A recent study by Tang dealt with DfAM in the context of lattices and used BESO to locally improve the size of truss-like members , creating a heterogeneous lattice . 
In this study , a meta-model was created , which was comprised of the geometrical manufacturing constraints regarding the deflection of horizontal struts and the thickness of struts with reference to the inclination angle . 
Additionally , the optimized lattice structure led to an increase in stiffness over the traditional homogeneous pendant . 
Besides , the abovementioned more favourable examples for the use of evolutionary algorithms for the optimisation of lattices , Chu have conversely demonstrated eminent drawbacks of the PSO over the non-evolutionary LMO optimisation , due to the stochastic nature of such algorithms . 
Based on ground truss structures which were optimized for a given volume fraction and a set allowable deflection , the optimal strut dimensions were obtained with both algorithms . 
Results showed comparable structural performance but the superior computational efficiency and convergence of the LMO method . 
The integration of DfAM constraints into the optimisation algorithms remains a bottleneck for a streamlined design procedure , calling for benchmarking studies helping to identify more efficient approaches in digital AM in future work . 
2 Topologically optimized lattices employing commercial software As the role of AM in the industry is slowly shifting towards production , ready-to-use design software capitalizing on now amenable features like lattices , are becoming more readily accessible . 
3DXpert for Solidworks , nTopology or ANSYS which is providing a AM-specific design platforms . 
1 Modelling structurally optimized lattices for printing In the context of trusses , Gorguluarslan developed a two-phase lattice optimisation framework , specifically tackling the issue of the minimum manufacturable cross-section . 
Here a primary ground structure optimisation is followed by a rectification process in which elements falling below a certain minimum cross-sections threshold are eliminated , before a final optimisation step is conducted , for which the method of Feasible Directions is employed . 
Altair 's OptiStruct and HyperMesh were utilized for structural optimisation . 
Among others , the typical cantilever beam example was used to compare the effectiveness of the framework and the MFD algorithm with Chang and Rosen 's SMS method and the Relative Density Mapping of Alzahrani , respectively . 
Under restriction of the minimum feature size , MFD was identified to outperform SMS and RDM in terms of stiffness but required more computational effort . 
However , it was also found that designs obtained from genetic algorithms and PSO have an even superior structural performance . 
In Abaqus served as a tool for the TO within the RDM method . 
Compared to the SMS method , the density values of the TO are used to map the struts into the domain , making RDM less dependent on the FEA analysis . 
Arisoy developed a framework for the substitution of solid parts of a CAD model with lattices , which served as the basis for a plugin in Siemens 's NX CAD software . 
boundary surface defining the layout of the lattice . 
During the FEA of the solid part , meshed with tetrahedral elements , a remeshing process including trimming is conducted ensuring that the elements are part of the lattice . 
Besides an improved and efficient workflow for AM , the authors concluded to have improved the boundary smoothness of the lattices with the implicit volume representation , so that the manufacturability for AM is improved . 
In terms of digitalization and streamlining the design process , this study demonstrated great promise , as the lattices were modelled within the same CAD environment . 
Based on the design optimisation of a missile launcher beam on a macro- and mesoscale , H exemplarily demonstrated the potential of multi-scale optimisation . 
They have effectively combined TO with partial substitution of solids with lattices , to design a lightweight beam using the commercial software Altair Inspire and Materialise Magics . 
2 Experimental benchmarking of 3D-printed lattices In contrast to the previous studies , Beyer and Figueroa tested different unit cell structures experimentally and Harl even determined the performance of optimized lattice structures by comparing them to numerical results . 
The experimental verification is vital as structural optimisation and DfAM aspects are mutually dependent . 
This stems from the individual characteristics and limitations of different AM processes affecting the properties . 
As outlined by Gibson , this is related to common meso- and microstructural features of cellular structures , affecting the structural performance , including : 1 ) material properties ; 2 ) cell topology and shape ; 3 ) relative density of structure . 
As the process-parameters influence the microstructure and consequently the performance , verification with the numerical model becomes vital for estimating the actual properties and improving future models . 
In , Netfabb 's Selective Space Structures tool was utilized to create lattices from rectangular prisms and hexagonal geometries , which were subsequently manufactured using the PolyJet and SLM process for polymers and aluminium , respectively . 
The compression and flexure tests of unit cells composed of a polymer revealed that the hexagonal unit cells show greater yield strengths and that comparable properties with the solid pendant can most likely be achieved with vertical trusses in the cell . 
Within the scaled lattices fabricated from polymer and aluminium , it was found that the kagome structure displayed the best performance-to-mass ratio . 
Moreover , it was reported that the aluminium lattice was superior to the polymer counterpart with respect to the solid structures , possibly stressing differences in manufacturing and therefore highlighting the role of DfAM . 
A connection between relative cell density , unit cell structure and structural performance , was established , giving designers and engineers helpful indications for the selection of the adequate lattice configuration . 
Similarly , Harl employed the CAESS ProTOp software for both the lattice generation and the subsequent TO of the lattice . 
The latter was conducted to improve the structural performance by lowering the local stress concentration to which cellular structures are prone to . 
Using selective laser sintering with polyamide , the designs were tested in flexure and the results clearly highlight the potential of using TO lattices in terms of weight-reduction , robustness and stiffness as well as its superiority over uniform lattices . 
The next paragraphs build on this idea of TO cellular structures by locally changing the cell density with the use of commercial software . 
In a study by Rezaie a beam under three-point bending was topologically optimized using Abaqus and subsequently manufactured in ABS using FDM . 
Here , the external boundaries of the bounding box were preserved , and the lattice composed of hollow cubic unit cells was mapped onto a SIMP-result . 
Additionally , manufacturability was taken into consideration by tailoring the hole-size to match the printer 's resolution . 
In comparison with the standard topologically optimized beam , the loss in performance turned out to be very minor . 
Especially when considering the more fabrication-friendly design of the cellular lattice , this method can be a viable alternative for lightweight structures . 
The significance of the results , however , must be reviewed critically , due to insufficient batch size and the well-known and inherent quality fluctuations in AM . 
Improved quality control measures are therefore needed form a manufacturing standpoint while an extensive data library will ease the choice in adequate lattice configurations from a design perspective . 
These aspects constitute -among others - a necessity with the increasing uptake of AM across industries . 
With the combination of the density-gradients from TO with a size optimisation , Daynes derived functionally graded truss-structures that align with the isostatic lines i.e . 
the principal stresses during loading . 
By making use of the Altair OptiStruct software , a topologically optimized design is automatically obtained , substituted by pre-selected unit cells before a size optimisation ensures that the overall target density is achieved . 
Upon the information on in-plane stresses and orientation extracted from the software , the authors developed a MATLAB subroutine to create a functionally graded mesh , which was fed back into the software for analysis . 
The substitution of the domain with BCC unit cells conformal with the isostatic lines resulted in a graded lattice with improved structural performance . 
Twice the stiffness and about 75 times greater strength were demonstrated in the experimental three-point bending tests compared to the uniform lattice design . 
These study highlights how much potential is still untapped in commercial software regarding the utilization of tailored , functionally graded lattices for enhanced specific structural performance . 
3 Commercial and academic software solutions for TO and the generation of cellular structures AM-specific design tools , incorporating TO or the implementation of lattices , are central to the greater adoption of AM . 
Today 's software landscape for AM-specific design provides a range of features that have been summarized in the supplementary information of this review . 
It is important to note , that the majority of commercial software to-date solve specific problems that are common for a wide range of industrial applications . 
14a illustrates the proportionate distribution of underlying TO-methods/approaches in commercial software to-date . 
14b constitutes the predominant file formats available in current lattice generation software . 
Analogously , lattice generation software is dominated by STL file formats , however , with the emerging complexity in e.g . 
multi-material prints we see the adoption and market share increase of 3MF and AMF file formats . 
To evaluate the effectiveness of the different software , more benchmarking research will be needed . 
A first attempt , recently published by Saadlaoui compared the performance of a topologically optimized cube under compression loading using Optistruct and Abaqus . 
A stress-constrained optimisation and a discrete-compliance optimisation were conducted in Abaqus as well as a continuous compliance optimisation in Optistruct . 
Both numerical and experimental results were obtained for the three approaches , whereby SLM was adopted for the fabrication of the specimens . 
This was explained by the consideration of internal material behaviour for the numerical model rather than the external criteria in the experiment . 
This aspect also includes local plastic deformations in the actual specimen , which do not necessarily affect the global elastic properties or mechanical strength and which are not accounted for in the commonly employed linear-elastic computational models , as stated by Saadlaoui . 
In terms of the computational procedures , the study revealed that the stress-constrained optimisation approach has the highest computational cost , but the corresponding specimen demonstrated the best mechanical performance with respect to the ratio of strength to weight . 
Computational efficiency and power are particularly important in continuum structural optimisations and will be key for viable design procedures in large-scale , multifunctional , multiscale and cellular-based TO . 
Recent efforts made to improve the feasibility of TO codes for machines with standard computational performance are equally important as the more salient examples , exploiting immense resources to explore what is ultimately possible . 
General conclusions , drawn from this review , can be summarized as : Superior solutions/designs for AM-parts can be obtained using structural optimization methods such as TO if DfAM considerations are included . 
This elucidates the need for a holistic design approach , paving way for how we design for AM in the future . 
Aspects of digitalization are still somewhat underrepresented and pose a bottleneck between design and manufacturing , including computationally inexpensive models and an entirely self-contained process from CAD file to Gcode . 
To bridge the gap to manufacturing , CAD/CAM software needs to be further improved , pathing among others the way for greater efficiency and compatibility when post-processing digital designs . 
Both multifunctional TO-based designs , considering multiple objectives and part-integration as well as latticing were considered particularly promising for lightweight high-performance parts . 
Functionally graded structures , specifically those that are optimized to better conform to the load trajectories , are inciting increased research interest . 
The most prominent TO method , both in academia and industry , is the density-based approach assuming isotropic material property . 
Level set methods seem to establish themselves increasingly in the market , due to the intrinsic smooth boundary representation , which is of great benefit for a streamlined design procedure . 
The sheer amount of software available for both TO and latticing that includes AM-specific design constraints , clearly demonstrates the industry is gravitating towards a wide application of AM . 
This is supported by the intensified interest in the academic community to make optimisation process more computationally efficient which is a necessity to make AM more accessible for a range of industries . 
As reviewed , the majority of studies concentrate on structural optimisation with the inclusion of inclination angle constraints as opposed to fabrication , materials or digitalization . 
Aspects deemed important for future work on the design and structural optimisation in AM , are as follows : Consistency through benchmarking mathematically-driven models and confidence via experimental verification will be important as industries are on the verge of adopting AM as means of production . 
Structural analyses accommodating path planning i.e . 
tailored infills and a simultaneous optimization of process and design will constitute a central aspect to improved structural performance in the future . 
In conjunction with a growing interest in fibre-reinforced AM , a key challenge will be to develop TO methods that account for anisotropic material considerations , paving the way for next-generation lightweight structures . 
The digital AM-workflow for print-ready designs would immensely benefit from smooth boundary representations . 
post-processing procedures for discrete solutions and more recently the intensified use of the level set method were observed . 
Their uptake by the industry into upcoming software could potentially constitute a boost for the future of AM . 
In light of both increasing complexity through the inclusion of DfAM constraints and multi-objective optimization as well as the orientation towards large-scale designs , generating high-resolution designs efficiently , will become a key challenge across all TO methods in the future . 
Contrary to previous developments , the industry pulls academia with regard to generative design , rather than taking solutions up . 
Due to the feasibility of economically producing large-scale metal components with relatively high deposition rates , significant progress has been made in the understanding of the Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing process , as well as the microstructure and mechanical properties of the fabricated components . 
As WAAM has evolved , a wide range of materials have become associated with the process and its applications . 
This article reviews the emerging research on WAAM techniques and the commonly used metallic feedstock materials , and also provides a comprehensive over view of the metallurgical and material properties of the deposited parts . 
Common defects produced in WAAM components using different alloys are described , including deformation , porosity , and cracking . 
Methods for improving the fabrication quality of the additively manufactured components are discussed , taking into account the requirements of the various alloys . 
The integration of materials and manufacturing process to produce defect-free and structurally-sound deposited parts remains a crucial effort into the future . 
In recent years , wire arc additive manufacturing has increasingly attracted attention from the industrial manufacturing sector due to its ability to create large metal components with high deposition rate , low equipment cost , high material utilization , and consequent environmental friendliness . 
The origin of the WAAM process can be traced back to the 1925s when Baker proposed to use an electric arc as the heat source with filler wires as feedstock materials to deposit metal ornaments . 
The WAAM technique bears various nomenclatures by different research institutions worldwide , as shown in 1 . 
Today , WAAM has become a promising fabrication process for various engineering materials such as titanium , aluminium , nickel alloy and steel . 
Compared to traditional subtractive manufacturing , the WAAM system can reduce fabrication time by 40and post-machining time by 15depending on the component size . 
For instance , recent breakthroughs in WAAM technology have made it possible to fabricate aircraft landing gear ribs with a saving of approximately 78 % in raw material when compared with the traditional subtractive machining process . 
Due to the highly complex nature of WAAM , many different aspects of the process need to be studied , including process development , material quality and performance , path design and programming , process modelling , process monitoring and online control . 
Several WAAM review papers have been published by leaders in the field , covering state-of-the-art systems , design , usage , in-situ process monitoring , in-situ metrology and in-process control and sensing . 
Nevertheless , there is still a need for a systematic review of the properties of various WAAM-processed materials , the defects associated with different alloys , and a summary of current and future research directions that are aimed at quality improvements for the alloy classes of interest . 
This paper reviews the microstructure and mechanical properties of various metals , including titanium and its alloys , aluminum and its alloys , Ni-based alloy , steel and other intermetallic materials fabricated by the various WAAM processes . 
The common defects that have been found to occur for different materials are also summarized . 
The current methods for both in-process and post-process quality improvement and defect reduction are introduced . 
Finally , a discussion is given on improving quality of WAAM fabricated parts through process selection , feedstock optimization , process monitoring and control and post-process , including proposals for future research directions . 
2 Wire arc additive manufacturing systems 2.1 Classification of WAAM process Depending on the nature of the heat source , there are commonly three types of WAAM processes : Gas Metal Arc Welding -based , Gas Tungsten Arc Welding -based and Plasma Arc Welding -based . 
As listed in 1 , specific class of WAAM techniques exhibit specific features . 
The deposition rate of GMAW-based WAAM is 2times higher than that of GTAW-based or PAW-based methods . 
However , the GMAW-based WAAM is less stable and generates more weld fume and spatter due to the electric current acting directly on the feedstock . 
The choice of WAAM technique directly influences the processing conditions and production rate for a target component . 
2.2 Robotic WAAM system Most WAAM systems use an articulated industrial robot as the motion mechanism . 
Two different system designs are available . 
The first design uses an enclosed chamber to provide a good inert gas shielding environment , similar to laser Power-Bed Fusion systems . 
The second design uses existing or specially designed local gas shielding mechanisms , with the robot positioned on a linear rail to increase the overall working envelop . 
It is capable of fabricating very large metal structures up to several a meters in dimension . 
2 shows an example of this design of WAAM system , used for the research and development at the University of Wollongong . 
Fabricating a part using WAAM involves three main steps : process planning , deposition , and post processing . 
For a given CAD model , 3D slicing and programming software generates the desired robot motions and welding parameters for the deposition process , aimed at producing defect-free fabrication with high geometrical accuracy . 
Based on the welding deposition model for the specific material being used to fabricate the component , the 3D slicing and programming software offer automated path planning and process optimization to avoid potential process-induced defects . 
During fabrication , the robot and external axis provide accurate motion for the welding torch to build up the component in a layer-by-layer fashion . 
Advanced WAAM systems can be equipped with various sensors to measure welding signals , deposited bead geometry , metal transfer behaviour and interpass temperature , thereby supporting in-process monitoring and control to achieve higher product quality . 
This is an area of current and future research interest , with the potential for significantly improving WAAM process performance . 
3 Metals used in WAAM process WAAM processes use commercially available wires which are produced for the welding industry and available in spooled form and in a wide range of alloys as feedstock materials . 
2 indicates the commonly used alloys and their various applications in WAAM . 
Manufacture of a structurally sound , defect free , reliable part requires an understanding of the available process options , their underlying physical processes , feedstock materials , process control methods and an appreciation of the causes of the various common defects and their remedies . 
This section reviews the metals that are commonly used in WAAM , with a particular emphasis on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the additively manufactured alloys . 
3.1 Titanium alloys Titanium alloys have been widely studied for application of additive manufacturing in aerospace components due to their high strength-to-weight ratio and inherently high material cost . 
There are increasing demands for more efficient and lower cost alternatives to the conventional subtractive manufacturing methods , which suffer very low fly-to-buy ratios for many component designs . 
There exists many business opportunities for the WAAM process , particularly for large-sized titanium components with complex structures . 
The distinctive WAAM thermal cycle , which involves repeated heating and cooling , produces meta-stable microstructures and inhomogeneous compositions in the fabricated part . 
For example , Baufeld investigated the microstructures of Ti6Al4V fabricated using a GTAW-based WAAM system , and found two distinctive regions on the as-built wall . 
In the bottom region , where alternating bands are perpendicular to the build direction , a basketwave Widmanststructure with phase lamellae is present , while in the top region , where no such bands appear , needle-like precipitate is the main structure . 
Similar microstructural evolution has also been observed in the PAW-based process . 
Lin reported a graded microstructure along the build direction and identified the martensite structure , Widmanststructure and basket-wave structure from the bottom to the top region of the fabricated component , as shown in 3 . 
An epitaxial growth of grains with discrete direction is also observed along the build direction owing to thermal gradient , commonly seen in additively manufactured titanium alloy components . 
3 summarizes the microstructure and mechanical property data of Ti6Al4V samples fabricated using various WAAM technologies . 
The as-forged and as-cast minimum specifications from ASTM standards are also listed for comparison . 
As shown in 4 , the tensile property of as-fabricated Ti6Al4V samples is close to that of wrought Ti6Al4V and exceeds that of cast Ti6Al4V as specified by ASTM standards . 
In addition , WAAM fabricated Ti6Al4V samples show anisotropic properties with lower strength and higher elongation values in the build direction compared to deposition direction , which is mainly attributed to the grain size of lamellae and the orientation of the elongated prior grains . 
3.2 Aluminum alloys and steel Although fabrication trials for many different series of aluminum alloys , including Al-Cu , Al-Si and Al-Mg have been successfully carried out , the commercial value of WAAM is mainly justifiable for large and complex thin-walled structures , since cost of manufacturing small and simple aluminum alloy components using conventional machining processes is low . 
Using WAAM to fabricate steel is unpopular for the same reason although it is the most commonly used engineering material . 
Another reason for the poor commercial application of WAAM in aluminum is that some series of aluminum alloys , such as Al 7xxx and 6xxx , are challenging to weld due to turbulent melt pool and weld defects , which frequently occur during the deposition process . 
In general , as-deposited additively manufactured aluminum alloy parts have inferior mechanical properties compared to those machined from billet material . 
In order to achieve higher tensile strength , most of the as-deposited aluminum parts undergo post-process heat treatment to refine the microstructure . 
4 lists the yield strength , ultimate tensile strength , and elongation of WAAM-fabricated 2219aluminium alloy samples . 
Due to the uniform distribution of large diamond particles within the microstructure , the sample exhibits lower UTS and YS than that of the wrought part specified by ASTM standard . 
However , after heat treatment , significant improvement beyond ASTM standard can be observed in both strength and elongation as a consequence of the grain refinement . 
3.3 Nickel-based superalloys Nickel-based superalloys are the second most popular material studied by the additive manufacturing research community after titanium alloys , mainly due to their high strengths at elevated temperatures and high fabrication cost using traditional methods . 
Nickel-based superalloys are widely applied in aerospace , aeronautical , petrochemical , chemical and marine industries due to their outstanding strength and oxidation resistance at temperatures above 550 To date , various Nickel-based superalloys , including Inconel 718 and Inconel 625 alloy have been studied after WAAM processing . 
The microstructure of WAAM fabricated Inconel 718 parts generally consists of large columnar grains with interdendritic boundaries delineated by small Laves phase precipitates and MC carbides . 
Xu reported that columnar dendrite structures decorated with a large amount of Laves phase , MC carbides and Ni3Nb are also present in WAAM-fabricated Inconel 625 parts , as shown in 5 . 
It is worth noting that the microstructure can be refined to smaller dendritic arm spacing , less niobium segregation and discontinuous Laves phase in the interdendritic regions using post-process heat treatments , which are beneficial to the mechanical properties . 
5 lists the mechanical properties of several Nickel-based superalloys fabricated using the WAAM process . 
For GMAW-based WAAM-fabricated Inconel 718 alloy , the yield and ultimate tensile strength is 473 6 MPa and 828 8 MPa respectively . 
These values lie between the minimum values specified by ASTM for wrought and cast materials , whereas the elongation is much lower than the standards for both wrought and cast conditions . 
As for WAAM-fabricated Inconel 625 alloy , the YS , UTS and elongation all meet the requirement set by ASTM for cast materials , and are slightly lower than those for wrought material . 
3.4 Other metals Other metals have also been investigated for potential fabrication using WAAM , such as magnesium alloy AZ31 for automotive applications , Fe/Al intermetallic compounds and Al/Ti compounds , as well as bimetallic steel/nickel and steel/bronze parts for the aeronautic industry . 
The detailed mechanical properties of these materials fabricated using WAAM are listed in 6 . 
Most of this research has focused on determining the microstructural and mechanical properties of samples taken from simple straight-walled structures , rather than developing a process to fabricate functional parts . 
Manufacturing intermetallic parts with accurate pre-designed composition still poses major challenges for the WAAM process . 
4 Common defects in WAAM-fabricated component Although the mechanical properties of components fabricated by WAAM are in many cases comparable to those of their conventionally processed counterparts , there are however some AM processing defects that must be addressed for critical applications . 
Porosity , high residual stress levels , and cracking , must be avoided , particularly for parts exposed to extreme environments where these defects lead to failure modes such as high temperature fatigue . 
Defects in WAAM can occur for various reasons , such as poor programming strategy , unstable weld pool dynamics due to poor parameter setup , thermal deformation associated with heat accumulation , environmental influence and other machine malfunctions . 
As shown in 6 , certain materials tend to be vulnerable to specific defects . 
For example , severe oxidization for titanium alloys , porosity for aluminum alloys , poor surface roughness in steel as well as severe deformation and cracks in bimetal components have been found to typically occur . 
7 lists the major defects that are commonly present in components fabricated using current WAAM techniques . 
The details of these common defects and their relationship to the materials will be discussed this section . 
4.1 Deformation and residual stress Like other additive manufacturing process , distortion and residual stress are inherent to the WAAM process and it is impossible to completely avoid its generation . 
The residual stress can lead to distortion of the part , loss of geometric tolerance , delamination of layers during deposition , as well as deterioration of fatigue performance and fracture resistance of the additively manufactured components . 
Therefore , control and minimization of deformation and residual stress is a key area if research . 
Various types of deformation appear in WAAM fabricated parts , including longitudinal and transvers shrinkage , bending distortion , angular distortion and rotational distortion . 
The distortions are caused by thermal expansion and shrinkage of the part during repeated melting and cooling processes , which is particularly an issue for large thin walled structures . 
Residual stress is the stress that remains in the material when all external loading forces are removed . 
If the residual stress is sufficiently high , it can be a critical influential factor in the mechanical properties and fatigue performance of the fabricated component . 
If the residual stress exceeds the local UTS of the material , cracking will take place , while if it is higher than the local YS but lower than UTS , warping or plastic deformation will occur . 
Ding found that the residual stress uniformly distributes across the WAAM deposited wall , and the residual stress in the preceding layer has little effect on the future layers . 
After release of clamping , however , the internal stress is redistributed with a much lower value at the top of integral part than at the interface to the substrate , resulting in bending distortion of the component . 
Path planning also involves the distortion and residual stress evolution in WAAM process . 
If appropriate deposition path designs , it will help in the significant improvement in these defects , especially in large metal fabrication . 
A detailed overview of the residual stress origin would exceed the scope of this article . 
Among all WAAM engineering materials , bimetal components exhibit high levels of residual stress and deformation due to the material thermal expansion difference . 
Hence , accurate interpass temperature control is needed when bimetal materials are used . 
WAAM-fabricated Inconel alloy has comparatively lower residual stresses levels , but it is more susceptible to process defects such as delamination , buckling and warping , since its residual stress is usually higher than the yield stress . 
Other comparatively softer materials , such as aluminum alloys , easily respond to deformation defects due to their high thermal expansion coefficients . 
A better understanding pf the effect of material characteristics in WAAM processing is needed for controlling residual stress and deformation during deposition . 
Deformation and residual stress are associated with many process parameters , such as welding current , welding voltage , feeding speed , ambient temperature , shielding gas flow rate , etc . 
Fortunately , several post-process treatments that have been proven to effectively mitigate residual stress and deformation , and these will be discussed 5 . 
4.2 Porosity Porosity is another common defect in WAAM processing that needs to be minimized due to adverse effects on mechanical properties . 
Firstly , porosity will lead to a component with low mechanical strength by damage from micro-cracks , and secondly , it usually brings low fatigue property to deposition via spatially with different size and shape distribution . 
In general , this type of defects are mainly classified as either raw material-induced or process-induced . 
The WAAM raw material , including as-received wire and substrate , often has a degree of surface contamination , such as moisture , grease and other hydrocarbon compounds that may be difficult to completely remove . 
These contaminants can be easily absorbed into the molten pool and subsequently generate porosity after solidification . 
Among common engineering materials , aluminum alloy is the most susceptible to this defect as the solubility of hydrogen in solid and liquid is significantly different . 
Even small amounts of dissolved hydrogen in the liquid state may exceed the limit of solubility after solidification , resulting in porosity . 
Therefore , the cleanliness of raw materials is critical , especially for aluminum alloys . 
Process-induced porosity is usually non-spherical , and mainly caused by poor path planning or an unstable deposition process . 
When the deposition path is complex or the manufacturing process is changeable , insufficient fusion or spatter ejection is easily produced , creating gaps or voids in these influenced regions . 
To control porosity , the following methods can be adopted : an AC GMAW-based process or CMT-PADV based process is preferred , especially for aluminum ; the highest quality shielding gas , tight gas seals , non-organic piping and short pipe lengths are highly recommended ; the wire and substrate surfaces are as clean as possible before fabrication ; high quality feedstock should be used ; the deposited bead shape needs to be optimized ; the thermal profile during processing should be monitored and controlled ; post-deposition treatment , such as interpass rolling can be applied . 
4.3 Crack and delamination Similar to residual stress and deformation , cracking and delamination not only involves the thermal signature of the manufacturing process , but also relates to the material characteristics of the deposit . 
Ordinarily , the crack is categorised as either a solidification crack or grain boundary crack within the WAAM component . 
The former type of crack depends mainly on the solidification nature of the material and is usually caused by the obstruction of solidified grain flow or high strain in the melt pool . 
Grain boundary cracking often generates along the grain boundaries due to the differences between boundary morphology and potential precipitate formation or dissolution . 
Generally , this deficiency is visible and can not be repaired by post-process treatment . 
In order to prevent this defect , pre-process treatment such as preheating of the substrate needs to be considered . 
Bimetal material combinations , such as Al/Cu , Al/Ti and Al/Fe , are quite susceptible to cracking and delamination when fabricated with the WAAM process . 
The dissimilar metals have large differences in their mutual solubility and chemical reactivity so that the intermetallic phase-equilibrium is freely broken , thus inducing crack growth along grain boundaries . 
Also , Inconel alloy readily generates solidification cracking issues due to the existence of liquid film at terminal solidification . 
Both of these material types should receive particular attention to avoid cracking and delamination . 
To control crack defects , corresponding measures can be taken as follows : Mixed wires and optimization of their compositions ; Decrease the cooling rate during the deposition process Other measures to improve strength rather than solution treatment . 
5 Current methods for quality improvement in the WAAM process Generally , WAAM parts require post-process treatment to improve material properties , reduce surface roughness and porosity , and remove residual stress and distortions . 
By appropriate application of post process , the majority of issues that influence deposition quality can be mitigated or eliminated . 
Presently , several post-process treatment technologies have been reported to improve part quality in the WAAM process . 
5.1 Post-process heat treatment Post-process heat treatment is widely used in WAAM to reduce residual stress , enhance material strength and as a method of hardness control . 
The selection of a suitable heat treatment process depends on the target material , additive manufacturing methods , working temperature and heat treatment conditions . 
If the heat treatment state is set incorrectly , the probability of cracking will increase under mechanical loading , as the combination of existing residual stress with load stress exceeds the materialdesign limitation . 
As summarized s 3after heat treatment , the mechanical strength of WAAM-fabricated parts improved significantly , with increase of 4 % , 78 % , 5 % and 17 % being reported for titanium alloy , aluminum alloy , Nickel-based superalloys and intermetallic Ti/Al alloy , respectively . 
In addition , post-process heat treatment plays an important role in grain refinement , especially for WAAM-fabricated aluminum and Inconel alloy . 
The decision to use post-process heat treatment depends on the material alloying system and also the pre-heat treatment state . 
Generally , high carbon content materials must be heat treated , while a few materials can be damaged by this technique . 
Therefore , the utilization of post heat treatment process to WAAM component needs to consider the specific material and its application . 
5.2 Interpass cold rolling Rolling of the weld bead between each deposited layer has been shown to reduce residual stresses and distortion.Interpass cold rolling not only lowers residual stress , but also brings more homogeneous material properties . 
In the WAAM process , the thermal gradient with deposition layers and alternate re-heating and re-cooling process result in the target part having anisotropic microstructural evolution and mechanical properties . 
The cold rolling technique significantly reduces microstructural anisotropy through plastically deforming the deposition . 
7 shows the schematic diagram of an interpass cold rolling system developed at Cranfield University . 
A slotted roller is used to refine the microstructure and enhance tensile strength in the longitudinal direction by supporting external force . 
As shown in 8 , both ultimate tensile strength and yield strength in the build direction were improved through interpass cold rolling , which contributes to more homogeneous material properties in the target component . 
Interpass cold rolling also can play a critical role in the healing of hydrogen porosity in WAAM-fabricated aluminum parts . 
Generally , high dislocation density is produced by the rolling process . 
These dislocation can act as preferential sites for atomic hydrogen absorption and as well as for the hydrogen , allowing to diffuse to the surface . 
9 summarizes the outcomes documented in the literature , in terms of the pore incidence and size distribution in aluminum components fabricated using WAAM with interpass cold rolling . 
The porosities existing in as-fabricated component can be reduced or even eliminated when interpass cold rolling is applied . 
This technique is only feasible for simple deposited parts , such as straight walls , due to the geometrical limitation of the rolling process . 
For more complex components with curves and corners , special flexible tooling need to be developed to achieve an effective rolling process , thus limiting the range of industrial application . 
Cold rolling technique will also reduce residual stress , but the ability to reduce overall part distortion is yet to be proven . 
5.3 Interpass cooling Recently , interpass cooling has been developed and evaluated at the University of Wollongong . 
8 presents the schematic diagram of a WAAM system with interpass cooling . 
The moveable gas nozzle , which supplies argon , nitrogen or CO2 gas , is used to provide active , or forced , cooling on the fabricated part during and/or after deposition of each layer . 
Using such rapid cooling , the in-situ layer temperature and heat cycle can be controlled within a range to obtain the desired microstructure and mechanical properties . 
This process may also potentially reduce residual stress and distortion , although this aspect has not been investigated . 
An initial feasibility study shows promising results when using forced interpass cooling with compressed CO2 to fabricate Ti6Al4V thin-walled structures , as shown in 9 . 
It was found that interpass cooling produces less surface oxidation , refined microstructure , improved hardness and enhanced strength . 
In addition , manufacturing efficiency is significantly improved due to the reduction of dwell time between deposited layers . 
More detailed research findings will be presented in future . 
5.4 Peening and ultrasonic impact treatment Peening and ultrasonic impact treatments have been used in welding applications to reduce local residual stress and improve weld mechanical properties . 
Both techniques are cold mechanical treatments that impact the weld surface using high energy media to release tensile stress by imposing compressive stress at the treatment surface . 
Usually , the mechanical peening process produces compressive stresses at a limited depth below the component surface , such as around 1mm in carbon steels . 
Ultrasonic impact treatment produces grain refinement and randomizes orientation , thus contributing to mechanical strength improvement . 
It is reported that after ultrasonic impact treatment , the surface residual stress of WAAM-fabricated Ti6Al4V part can be reduced to 58 % and the microhardness can be increased by 28 % compared to the as-fabricated sample . 
Also , the surface-modified layers undergo plastic deformation with significant grain refinement and dense dislocations . 
The ultrasonic impact treatment is limited by penetration depth , which is up to 60 below surface . 
Therefore , although both techniques are good post-process treatments , they have negligible effect on internal residual stresses of large metal part fabricated using WAAM . 
6 Discussion Improving process stability , eliminating or decreasing deposition defects and producing components with high quality and mechanical performance have become major research focuses in making the WAAM process more competitive against other additive manufacturing methods . 
An in-depth understanding of various materials , ideal process setup , in-process parameter control and post processing is essential for achieving such a goal . 
After a systematic review and analysis , a quality-based framework aiming to achieve high-quality and defects-free WAAM process is proposed , as shown in 10 . 
Three main aspects are considered : feedstock optimization , manufacturing process , and post-process treatment . 
Selection of the most suitable welding WAAM process for the deposition material can ensure manufacturing process stability and contribute to reduction of defects . 
For example , if the CMT-PADV process is used for producing aluminum parts , porosity defects can be dramatically reduced when compared to other GMAW modes . 
Moreover , integrated and reliable process monitoring and control systems are needed to maintain the stability of the process and ensure the quality of production . 
Usually , the bead geometry , interpass temperature , arc characteristics and metal transfer behaviour are included in process monitoring and control . 
Controlling the interpass temperature within a reasonable range is beneficial to microstructural evolution and the resulting mechanical properties . 
Further , regulating the arc characteristics and metal transfer behaviour in real time is helpful to process stability and avoidance of defects . 
Based on the process monitoring data that has been collected during deposition , one of several post-process treatments can be selected to mitigate defects and improve mechanical performance . 
Considering the material characteristics , microstructural evolution and mechanical properties can also be optimized through new feedstock composition design . 
It is well known that different alloying elements have specific effects on material properties . 
By referring to the phase diagram , the desired deposition microstructures can be obtained via adding specific alloying elements in the feedstock and subsequent mechanical properties improved . 
For example , twin-wire GTAW-based WAAM has been successfully developed to produce intermetallic graded materials . 
The development of new powder cored wires , will offer exciting opportunities for fabricating target components with accurate metal composition . 
In summary , using new welding consumables brings a cost effective solution , which supports high deposition quality through obtaining the desired microstructures , lowering manufacturing costs by reducing or eliminating pre-weld cleaning and re-work , and providing safer working environments by reducing weld fumes . 
Another essential part of WAAM processing for most materials is post-process treatment , which is used to reduce residual stresses and distortion , refine microstructures , improve microhardness and enhance material strength . 
However , post-process technologies have their own limitations , for instance , peening and ultrasonic impact treatment only improve material property and reduce defects near the part surface , while extended heat treatment of certain materials promotes grain growth rather than grain refinement . 
Currently , most WAAM fabricated parts need to be post-process treated with a selective combination of technologies to reduce the defects and improve the product quality to the greatest extent possible . 
7 Conclusions A detailed review of recent technological developments in WAAM process has been presented , with a focus on microstructure , mechanical properties , process defects and post-process treatment . 
Through matching a knowledge of material characteristics with the performance features of particular WAAM techniques , a quality-based framework is proposed , for producing high-quality and defect-free components . 
In WAAM of metallic materials , the fundamental interrelationships between material composition and microstructure govern the material properties and fabrication quality . 
Since the WAAM process is an inherently non-equilibrium thermal process , it is challenging to predicate and control the microstructural evolution , which is responsible for the variation of mechanical properties in the deposited part . 
Further research attention should be paid on the study of underlying physical and chemical metallurgical mechanisms in WAAM process to provide a guidance for the process optimization , improvement and control . 
The defects generated in WAAM-produced part are closely related to the target material characteristics and process parameters . 
The development of strategies or ancillary process to overcome defects generation are of prime importance . 
As WAAM matures as a commercial manufacturing process , development of a commercially available WAAM system for metal components is an interdisciplinary challenge , which integrates physical welding process development , materials science and thermo-mechanical engineering , and mechatronic and control system design This study presents a review on powder bed laser additive manufacturing of stainless steel .

Laminated object additive manufacturing is an additive-subtractive rapid prototyping manufacturing process where 3D objects are manufactured by metal sheet material that are bonded together by thermally activated adhesive coating layer by layer . 
Each layer is formed from a sheet of paper coated with a thermoplastic adhesive and sheet is bonded together by using a heated stainless steel roller after which a CO2 laser cuts cross-section into a layer of paper according to the information from the CAD model repeatedly until the required object is formed and lamination is actualized .

Some recent research works on stainless steel using these powder bed additive manufacturing techniques are presented and future research need are also proposed . 
Selective Laser Sintering of Stainless Steel This additive manufacturing process is a powder based layer-additive manufacturing process where metallic components are built section by section . 
A moderately low laser power is used in this process as metallic material never reach a liquid phase during the heating process . 
The process occurs at a faster rate at high temperature which is why it involves heating a powder . 
The process is achieved when the laser scan powder material deposited on the substrate on the 2D cross-section of the part created in 3D geometrical shape . 
The process is repeated in which after the first laser scan , the powder bed is lowered by the amount of thickness of the layer produced initially , and then a new layer of powder material is spread on the powder bed again on top of the initial scanned layer until a fully dense built part is produced . 
Selective laser sintering process has the potential to become one of the most valuable additive manufacturing techniques , because it has potential to easily produced complex shapes .

Selective Laser Melting of Stainless Steel Selective Laser Melting process is an additive manufacturing technology that can be used to produce solid metallic components from metallic powder by using a high intensity laser to melt and fuse selective region of the metallic powder layer by layer according to the computer aided design data . 
A new layer of metal powder is applied and the build platform is being lowered by the amount of thickness of one layer . 
The process involves building of component layer by layer by depositing a thin metallic powder on a substrate . 
A high intensity power laser is then used to melt and fuse together a specific area of the metallic powder according to the data from the 3D CAD . 
Once the laser scanning is completed , succeeding layer of metallic powder is deposited on top and laser scans another new layer until the required component is completely built after repeated successive layer of metallic powder is deposited . 
Once the laser scanning processes completed , loose powders are removed from the building chamber and the component can be separated from the substrate plate manually or by electrical discharge machining .

Casati studied the microstructure and fracture behaviour of 316L austenitic stainless steel produced by selective laser melting and discovered that severe thermal gradients and high cooling rates affects the crystal growth and orientation of grain structure after solidification .

Selective laser melting has been extensively explored with stainless steel but further study need to be done with the employment of other grades of stainless steel This review article summarizes the current state-of-the-art for biomimicry in additive manufacturing . 
Biomimicry is the practice of learning from and emulating nature - which can be increasingly realized in engineering applications due to progress in additive manufacturing . 
AM has grown tremendously in recent years , with improvements in technology and resulting material properties sometimes exceeding those of equivalent parts produced by traditional production processes . 
This has led to the industrial use of AM parts even in highly critical applications , most notably in aerospace , automotive and medical applications . 
The ability to create parts with complex geometries is one of the most important advantages of this technology , allowing the production of complex functional objects from various materials including plastics and metals that can not be easily produced by any other means . 
Utilizing the full complexity allowed by AM is the key to unlocking the huge potential of this technology for real world applications and biomimicry might be pivotal in this regard . 
Biomimicry may take different forms in AM , including customization of parts for individuals , or optimization for specific properties such as stiffness and light-weighting . 
The optimization process often uses an iterative simulation-driven process analogous to biological evolution with an improvement in every iteration . 
Other forms of biomimicry in AM include the incorporation of real biological inputs into designs ; the use of cellular or lattice structures for various applications and customized to the application ; incorporating multi-functionality into designs ; the consolidation of numerous parts into one and the reduction of waste , amongst others . 
Numerous biomimetic design approaches may be used broadly categorized into customized/freeform , simulation-driven and lattice designs . 
not for prototyping . 
The current limits of each design approach are discussed and the most exciting future opportunities for biomimetic AM applications are highlighted . 
The beauty found in nature is often inspirational - and this inspiration has found its way into functional mechanical engineering through the latest developments in additive manufacturing . 
Other forms of engineering beauty are structural hierarchy , order or lack of order , and combinations with other structures . 
Learning from these biological structures may advance our use of efficient structures in engineering applications and may even help to provide new solutions to engineering problems , in a sustainable way . 
Biomimicry in engineering involves the study of biological systems specifically with the aim to use information learned in solving engineering problems , or for use in engineering applications . 
In nature , structural features from nano to micro to macro scale define an objectproperties and functionalities and vice versa . 
Modern engineering design has the possibility to change the structural features and properties of the objects while maintaining functionality or to apply simulation to find a design for specific required properties . 
In an ideal case , AM is able to translate innovative biomimetic design into physical objects with the desired properties and functionality . 
Much of this potential has particularly realistic prospects when using AM , with its freedom of design and complex production capabilities . 
The capability to emulate the complex structures and hence the properties of biological materials is the aim of biomimicry . 
For example , failure of a specific design that is claimed to be biomimetic but uses no input from nature , might undermine the credibility of biomimicry . 
Often structures with curves and rounded edges in any way resembling something in nature are referred to as or This is not incorrect but it must be kept in mind that no biological input is present , and as such is not truly biomimetic or bio-inspired . 
Additionally , when a structure is designed for a biological application it may be termed biomimetic or bionic simply due to its intended biological role . 
Topology optimization , generative design and simulation-driven design tools used to create optimized designs using simulation often create unconventional and complex shapes and forms . 
The simulation-driven design process is in reality also biomimetic or bio-inspired in the sense that it is iterative and therefore mimics aspects of natural evolutionary strategies in a short timeframe . 
In the area of cellular or lattice structure design , some engineers refer to all porous engineered structures as biomimetic simply due to their resemblance to natural porous materials , or their similarity to the biological equivalent . 
However , cellular and lattice designs have unlimited design permutations and can therefore be tailored to the application . 
Currently , the most important application for these porous engineered structures is in dental and bone implants . 
The latter is a biomimetic application in the sense that the structure should emulate bone for best results , in terms of mechanical properties and permeability . 
Finally , biomimetic lattice structures may also specifically refer to stochastic design strategies which create structures with a random distribution of strut thicknesses and lengths the randomness emulates nature . 
A biomimetic and bio-inspired approach to materials design has attracted great interest from scientists in diverse areas : biophysics and biomaterials , sensors and chemistry , materials science and engineering , to name a few . 
From 2016 , with the progress in AM technology and wider understanding of the fact that complex designs can be realized in real AM products , biomimetic approaches began to be the subject of research in more than 150 papers per year . 
Interest in lattice structures produced by AM also increased year by year . 
In recent years AM has grown from a prototyping technology to a reliable direct production technique . 
In particular , metal AM has developed tremendously , up to the point where it is now possible to produce functional metal parts for critical applications in medical and aerospace industries . 
Powder bed fusion is the term used to specifically describe metal AM using a laser or electron beam to melt tracks and layers for the manufacture of detailed and complex shaped parts . 
The track-by-track and layer-by-layer PBF process allows the manufacturing of parts with intricate , complex designs . 
Part complexity allows designs to be optimized for specific applications such as light-weighting in aerospace parts or improving bone growth and implant success in bone implants . 
It has been demonstrated that the mechanical performance of PBF parts can be superior to traditionally manufactured equivalents and lots of work has been done in particular in Ti6Al4V as shown in . 
Laser powder bed fusion is limited to intricate parts typically smaller than 300 mm for larger metal parts it is possible to use wire and arc AM with a reduction in detail possible . 
In addition to metals , various other materials can be reliably processed using AM including polymers , ceramics and various types of composites , as is discussed in more detail in . 
Metals are highly likely to have practical uses in biomimetic structural applications in military , aerospace and automotive industries due to the light-weight and strong parts that can be produced , and hence much effort has been aimed in this direction . 
However , many biological systems are based on combinations of stiff and softer materials , and often have mechanical properties more like polymers and composite materials . 
Therefore , many applications also exist for nature-inspired designs in materials other than metals . 
Many of the examples presented in this review focus specifically on metal AM , due to their relevance for high-value functional end-use parts , but the same principles apply to all other additively manufactured materials . 
For products designed by biomimicry , it has been proposed that two broad approaches exist : the approach and the approach as outlined in . 
In the first case , the designer/engineer is inspired by a biological concept or model and applies this to a new design idea . 
In addition to these approaches , three major ways of obtaining a designed biomimetic model in practice exist : customized/freeform design , simulation-driven design and lattice design . 
For example , lattices may be incorporated in a freeform design process or in a simulation-design process . 
All these approaches may also be used with or without direct input from nature , with varying levels of biological input or bio-inspiration possible . 
Customized and freeform design involves manipulation with curved surfaces and is typically used to create custom and unique designs fit for a particular application while maintaining functionality . 
For instance , customized implants aimed at directly replicating the bone shape for replacement , tree-like support structures , nervous-system-inspired shade or hierarchical networks where nodes constantly branch and merge . 
This process is the simplest of the biomimetic design methods , particularly useful for customization such as in prosthetics or implants , and is also used in artistic design . 
With reference to prosthetics and implants , the design requirement is taken from a biological shape , hence the biomimetic description . 
In addition , freeform design results in organic shapes which can often resemble natural structures . 
Simulation-driven design is a very promising approach which has emerged in recent years and is especially useful for light-weight design for engineering applications . 
This involves structural optimization and uses an iterative process of simulation and material removal to optimize the required material distribution or material stiffness for a given set of expected load cases . 
This process of stepwise optimization is similar to most evolutionary processes in nature , and removal of material in areas of low stress is a similar optimization strategy as is used in natural systems , hence the motivation to categorize this process as biomimetic . 
The field of topology optimization in AM was reviewed recently in , where the current limits of the practical use of this technique was discussed in detail , especially with regards to overhang angle , support removal , residual stress , build quality including challenges in software tools that need to be solved for its more widespread adoption . 
The use of additively-manufactured lattice or cellular structures is a highly relevant approach which is often combined with the former methods , i.e . 
the incorporation of lattices or cellular designs into optimized organic or topology optimized designs . 
Natural systems often use cellular structures and these are widely used in bio-inspiration for the use of lattices in engineering parts , hence the categorization as biomimetic . 
Lattices have obvious light-weighting advantages , high specific stiffness , fracture toughness , crack growth arresting , amongst other desirable and tailorable properties . 
One major application of cellular structures is their use in bone implants , to improve osseointegration . 
The design theory for present-day AM in general was reviewed and limitations discussed in . 
On the topic of biomimetic 3D printing , the review gives a detailed overview of the use of biological inputs into the design process , discusses biological study systems used in biomimicry and focusses on applications of polymer and multi-material 3D printing , but does not discuss metal AM or simulation-driven design . 
Biomimetic approaches for AM include the design of innovative materials and systems . 
In addition to simulation-driven design of single-material parts , fracture-resistant composite materials could be designed using simulation-driven design and validated by multi-material 3D printing as demonstrated in . 
Multi-material biomimetic design for medical purposes has been demonstrated in . 
Not all freeform designs , lattice designs or topology optimized designs include biological input , but they are still referred to as biomimetic in a broader sense . 
True biological input in the AM design process is still rare in engineering due to the lack of biologists involved in engineering design in general . 
Nevertheless , biological materials science is a mature field which focuses on studying biological systems to understand their properties and potentially employ these designs in engineering systems . 
Biological materials often possess superior mechanical properties due to unique combinations of hard and soft materials and gradients between them . 
Biologically inspired design principles have been categorized recently into fibrous , helical , gradient , layered , tubular , cellular , suture and overlapping structures . 
Besides broad design categories or guidelines , the use of X-ray tomography to study intricate details of individual biological structures in 3D for biomimetic applications is also a promising strategy to learn from nature . 
Incorporating biological inputs into engineering design is a topic of continued effort and includes the development of biomimicry design databases . 
Biomimetic design has also been named as it has been suggested that these approaches may lead to the use of the minimum required materials , which is most environmentally sustainable . 
Despite the access to complexity and freedom of design , which is often cited for AM , all the biomimetic approaches discussed here have practical manufacturability limits in the context of present-day AM systems . 
A recent review paper covers the use of AM to produce bio-inspired structures with the main aim to learn about and optimize the biological structures themselves . 
In the area of biomimetic cellular design , various recent reviews are useful and relevant to bone implant applications in particular , and are more generally discussed for various applications in . 
It is therefore the aim of this present review paper to fill the gaps between these areas and address all the above biomimetic approaches in one cohesive framework . 
Most examples used in this paper are focused on metal AM due to its ability to produce functional end-use parts , but the principles are broadly applicable to all additively manufactured materials . 
While most of the discussion and examples are using laser powder bed fusion , other AM technologies are equally applicable and the design and challenges vary slightly with each technology . 
For example , binder jetting has shown some promise for realization of complex designs cost effectively , but the obtained material properties require investigation . 
The fields of biomimicry and AM hold a unique synergy and inter-dependence on one another . 
2 True biomimicry True biomimicry of natural form , involves the purposeful emulation of structure-function relationships in biological entities to solve engineering challenges , or to apply these to advanced engineering systems . 
A review on biomimicry and bio-inspiration in the field of AM and 3D printing is provided in and focuses on explaining different potential biological study organisms and associated applications with specific biological input , mostly by polymer AM . 
In addition , the review highlights the potential for different forms of AM technologies to mimic nature . 
As mentioned above , the goal of biomimetic research is to learn generic design rules from natural systems to assist the development of optimized biomimetic materials which can be used widely in engineering systems . 
To illustrate , osteoderms thin plates of dermal bone that form protective natural body armour in various animal species not only play a defensive role , but might also be involved in physiological processes such as thermoregulation . 
The structural changes required for a physiological capacity might decrease the strength of osteoderms , rendering the structure less optimally adapted for protection than what would be expected . 
Alternatively , a bio-inspiration approach can be employed to alter specific properties of the natural structure resulting in an optimal design . 
Glyptodon osteoderms consists of a lattice core sandwiched between two compact layers that form a shell . 
By printing and testing 3D models with varying lattice and shell parameters , the optimized shell thickness compared to lattice density and lattice strut thickness was revealed . 
Similar procedures have been used to reverse-engineer a natural structure for application as a gripping device the Aristotlelantern structure as described in . 
The mechanical properties of natural materials , particularly the superior fracture toughness , make biological structures highly suitable for biomimetic studies . 
Nevertheless , a major advantage of AM is that a structure of interest can be further optimized by using materials that do not occur naturally in biological systems . 
In the case of glyptodont osteoderms , the use of biomimetic reverse-engineered metal models show remarkable strength and energy absorption capacity . 
Besides material properties , the combination of hard and soft materials has been studied for improved fracture toughness properties using simulation-driven design tools . 
In a recent study , pangolin scales were used as inspiration for bendable protective material for aerospace applications different combinations of hard plates and soft connecting material were 3D printed and mechanically tested . 
Lastly , the microarchitecture of biological structures , which can be categorized as one of eight forms : fibrous , helical , gradient , layered , tubular , cellular , suture and overlapping , plays an important role in determining the mechanical properties of biological materials . 
These structural organizations can be replicated by AM to study and optimize the arrangement of biological materials as discussed in . 
Hierarchical structures such as functional graded materials , structures and surfaces can be produced directly by AM or in combination with other methods . 
For example , LPBF and femtosecond laser surface modification makes it possible to produce complex hierarchical structures for wettability applications . 
Stereolithography and LPBF was applied for manufacturing of a multi-material arm orthosis ; this approach can be used for manufacturing implants where the strength varies throughout the implant . 
In general , AM of in-situ LPBF sintered composite objects also is a form of biomimicry since biological tissues are composite materials with stiff reinforcing elements and binding medium . 
A pivotal tool to characterize structures for biomimicry or bio-inspiration is X-ray micro-computed tomography , as reviewed in . 
MicroCT is ideally suited to obtain detailed microstructural information of natural structures in 3D , which can be used to directly replicate natural structures , measure 3D design values and implement these in engineering structures as bio-inspiration , or in a broader sense to create a design principle without using any measurements . 
These three are shown in 3 , using the examples of a direct replication of a structure printed on an entry-level FDM printer , a reverse-engineered design based on measurements taken from a natural structure and a generic bio-inspiration example in which honeycomb structures are used as light-weight design . 
The main aim of direct replication is to investigate the structure of interest . 
For reverse-engineering , the goal is similar to that of direct replication , but the techniques make the structure more practical for direct engineering applications . 
The generic bio-inspiration involves using design or guidelines from nature , which might be more beneficial when limits are imposed on the structure . 
One biological structure that is of particular interest to biomimetic studies , and which has been studied extensively using microCT , is the lightweight structure of bird feathers and bones . 
Here , bio-inspiration and design rules might be applied in engineering designs for aerospace applications . 
In recent work using topology optimization techniques , an optimized light-weight structure for an airplane wing was demonstrated through simulation and optimization , with the obtained structure having a strong resemblance to the structure of bird wing bones , i.e. 
, a solid shell and connecting rods at angles inside the hollow structure . 
While the optimality of bone design had been well described analytically , this was the first example of large-scale computational structure design : the rapid increase in computing power over the last years now allows for obtaining detailed structures from simulation-driven design tools , which for the first time nears the complexity of natural systems . 
In conclusion , the complexity that AM allows makes it possible to manufacture true biomimetic structures , yet , knowledge of the biological structure is necessary . 
3 Customized and freeform design Traditional design for engineering involves individual part design in computer-aided design tools , with engineering expertise and intuition required to understand the limits of traditional subtractive manufacturing . 
This most often results in traditional designs with right angles and flat surfaces due to the simplicity for subtractive manufacturing of such designs . 
Over the last few years , advanced manufacturing techniques have become available and viable which allows the design engineer more freedom to create parts with more complex designs . 
These new design capabilities allow organic shapes and freeform designs , which are often also termed biomimetic due to their organic shapes resembling natural structures and sometimes , in the case of medical devices in particular , the forms are shaped to fit natural materials such as bone implants . 
Natural structures tend to comprise of curves and organic shapes as they represent a balance between minimal energy expenditure and material used on the one hand , and maximal return of work on the other hand , all within the organismdevelopmental limits . 
Freeform and custom designs may be termed biomimetic as they resemble natural structures in these aspects , but without the constraints imposed by the organism itself . 
Despite this freedom of design , traditional engineering thinking is often limited to experience of using right angles and flat surfaces . 
In order to optimally use this new design freedom , additional tools are needed . 
The most important contributing tools for freeform design are discussed here . 
One of these is the shaping of curved and organic surfaces by the use of T-splines and more recently polygonal non-uniform rational B-spline . 
These tools allow organic designs with curved surfaces that often resemble natural structures . 
These are also critical tools in final steps of topology optimization and even true biomimetic reverse engineering structures , ultimately allowing for watertight models with curved geometries . 
Not only do these tools make custom curved shapes possible in a relevant workspace , but they are also effectively translated into geometries suitable for simulation and/or AM . 
In terms of custom design especially for implants patient-specific implants are a special category and require a particular workflow involving the processing of medical image data , the use of CAD tools and design for AM knowledge to yield a good resulting implant as discussed in . 
An example is shown in 4 where a patient-specific facial implant was produced in Ti6Al4V . 
Increases in computing power , the availability of cloud computing and the wider availability of CAE tools all led to the sharp increase in advanced and complex design capability . 
One of the first examples was the Insight Plotfrom Solidworks , which demonstrates the main load paths in a designed part , as calculated from one or more applied loads by finite element modelling . 
This was a forerunner of topology optimization tools which will be discussed in more detail in the next section . 
As mentioned above , AM releases much of the traditional limits of subtractive manufacturing allowing much wider allowed manufacturing complexity . 
This is already broadly acknowledged , and new design rules for reliable manufacturing in all forms of AM are emerging and in many cases are already mature and well-defined . 
The design for AM rules and practical issues are discussed in detail in and more recently in the context of topology optimization in . 
One major advantage of these new design tools for creating manually organic and curved surfaces and shapes is the ability to create artistic features the resemblance to biological/natural and organic structures brings a new dimension to artistic designs for end-use products . 
The use of 3D printing in arts , fashion and jewelry is growing as is shown in and artistic design is easily achieved by AM , without significantly adding to the cost of the product . 
Freeform design tools can be used to shape custom-fit sportswear or footwear , with the first fully-AM footwear being produced by Adidas Futurecraft . 
The design of this shoe is entirely latticed giving a futuristic and biomimetic visual appeal . 
These are two examples of mass production and mass customization by AM . 
Aspects of importance besides personal/custom design for fit , is the incorporation of logos or names , and the ability for the customer to take part in the design process giving them some options making their product unique . 
4 Simulation-driven biomimetic design One of the first drivers of the concepts behind simulation-driven design was from the ideas of Julius Wolff , the 19th Century Orthopedic surgeon , who first suggested that , a consequence of primary shape variations and continuous loading , or even due to loading alone , bone changes its inner architecture according to mathematical rules and , as a secondary effect and governed by the same mathematical rules , also changes its shape . 
The concept of topology optimization sprung from here from the concept that a structure can be optimized by following load paths and be modified to fit the particular mechanical requirement . 
The first industrial class software solutions incorporating the rules of design along with the ability to capture the along with the constraints to automatically generate design was released in the early 1990This was primarily the beginning of CAE simulation driving inspirational designs . 
Over the years many manufacturing constraints have also been added to shape these designs to be cognizant of the downstream manufacturing , and is relevant to different manufacturing processes . 
If the part is produced by an extrusion process , then using the extrusion constraints will generate a shape that is extrudable across the defined design space . 
Likewise , on specifying a casting constraint , the bionic shape that is generated will be free of undercuts for easy extraction from the casting molds . 
For AM , overhang constraints generate shapes that have minimal support requirement during build in a given print direction , with less horizontal sections , for example . 
There are various manufacturing constraints in AM that can be incorporated into the design optimization process and it is the incorporation of these into the topology optimization process which will create designs ready for production . 
Shown in 5 are selected examples from Altair covering a variety of parts that illustrate the power of simulation in mimicking nature for product design that outperform conventional designs and are manufacturable and lightweight . 
The first example is the HardMarque automotive piston which was designed and optimized for production by additive manufacturing in titanium the end result is reported to be 25 % lighter and equally strong compared to the original aluminium part . 
The second example from Renishaw is a seat post bracket of a mountain bike , meant to replace a cast aluminium part with additively manufactured titanium : the mass reduction was reported at 40 % . 
The third example is a case study from the aerospace industry , in particular the optimization of a mechanical hinge for an Airbus A320 by the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Innovation Works in this case a 75 % mass reduction was realized . 
The last example is a research project with Laser Zentrum Nord focusing on lightweighting of aircraft cabin brackets . 
Simulation-driven design in the context of AM refers to the use of simulation to numerically and a given space to meet some desired performance criteria under a defined set of constraints . 
This currently refers to either of topology optimization or generative design , which can often be used interchangeably in the context of AM both involve the use of simulation . 
Topology optimization refers to optimizing an existing shape or design space . 
Generative design is a broader definition of exploring a variety of possible designs within a given space with a desire to identify an optimal solution from various possible solutions meeting the same performance criteria . 
In the context of design for AM , both the approaches are aimed at creating light-weight parts which mostly contain material in areas were load is experienced and material is removed in areas which do not require it . 
This process of simulation and material-removal or addition is repeated iteratively until an optimization goal is achieved , and this iterative process may be seen analogous to the process of evolution . 
In fact , these simulations sometimes make use of genetic and evolutionary algorithms . 
Effectively , these algorithms incorporate rules like in nature to mathematically disallow weaklings to proliferate , but in an accelerated fashion using clever computational methods . 
More recently this was also described in terms of manufacturing challenges in and in terms of available software tools and their differences and limits in . 
A good example of topology optimization , applied to an extreme lightweighting requirement is the design of a titanium alloy drone frame , with larger dimensions than can be produced on typical powder bed fusion systems . 
This was produced on the large-scale laser powder bed fusion system called Aeroswift and the design done in collaboration with Altair . 
The design iteration process is shown in 6 , done in Altair Inspire . 
Another example of a topology optimized part a load bearing bracket is shown in 7 , which is taken from . 
This titanium alloy bracket was designed to replace a traditional composite bracket in an experimental vehicle for the Shell eco-challenge . 
The design process schematic here shows the original composite part , the design space , the optimized solution and the final smoothed solution , after application of connections and polyNURBS to the surfaces . 
This part was also used in a round robin test whereby the same bracket was produced at various commercial laser powder bed fusion systems and detailed analysis performed using microCT . 
The study highlighted the need for testing AM parts to ensure structural integrity . 
Another example is the design for a large bracket for the same vehicle related to the above-mentioned example . 
8 shows the optimized topology itself which is also latticed : this is a sequential process in most software packages and the area to be latticed and the lattice parameters are selected by the user . 
Latticing will be discussed in the next section and holds many advantages but must be carefully implemented in a design , due to issues such as requirement for supports inside the lattice region , and struts which are potentially too thin . 
The first is the Bugatti brake caliper which is shown in 9 , and which is currently the worldlargest functional part produced in titanium by AM . 
In this case the use of Ti6Al4V titanium alloy is especially useful for light-weighting , as this material is already strong and relatively light . 
Its use for automotive and aerospace applications is well known , but manufacturing complex designs by traditional manufacturing methods in this material is extremely challenging . 
The topology optimization result is visually impressive , the performance of this caliper has been validated in various tests and is used in production vehicles , with a 40 % mass reduction compared to the previous version made of aluminium . 
5 Cellular and lattice design Cellular structures exist in nature in numerous shapes , sizes and packing arrangements some of the most well-known examples are the beehoneycomb , wood cells and spongy bone , all of which are discussed in a book by Gibson . 
MicroCT scans of some natural cellular materials are shown in 11 . 
In fact , one of the first true observations of cellular structures in nature can be traced back to 1665 , when Robert Hooke published his observation of the cellularity in cork and suggested that the unique behavior of cork was attributable to its underlying cellular structure . 
Humans have been using cellular materials such as wood , cork and bamboo , several millennia before we realized the underlying structural basis for their interesting behaviour . 
Lattices today owe much of their origins and design selection to mathematics and crystallography , as well as following Maxwellstability criterion , which was primarily developed in the context of large engineering structures . 
The main utility of cellular or lattice structures lies in their ability to meet performance targets while enabling significant mass reduction , something that is a principle commonly embodied in nature . 
While cellular materials do tend to have lower effective material stiffness and strength properties , this reduction is often acceptable and can be tailored to the application , as well as varied locally . 
Lattices may also be useful for other purposes besides light-weighting : they have interesting thermal , acoustic properties and energy absorbing properties under compressive loading they perform a crucial protection role in nature . 
Cellular materials have also been seen as a crucial enabler for large system-level multi-functional design optimization , such as in an aircraft wing . 
The categorization of natural cellular structures is discussed in more detail in a recent review article which focuses on biomimetic design of cellular materials utilizing cellular designs in engineering systems . 
Perhaps the most commonly used , and well-known bio-inspired cellular material is the honeycomb , which has found a wide range of applications in architecture , transportation , chemical engineering and more , as compiled in a review article . 
With regard to additively manufactured cellular materials , the emphasis in the past decade has been on lattice structures , and their use for medical bone-replacement implant applications . 
In this application , the primary role of the lattice is to allow for osseointegration of bone into the implant , thereby causing better fixation . 
A recent book chapter describes the most important criteria for bone regeneration in titanium implants produced by powder bed fusion and the production of topologically designed and otherwise designed porous lattices for this application was also reviewed in . 
From an engineering standpoint , cellular materials are realized practically in commercial software packages using different approaches . 
Traditional CAD software uses mesh-based representation , but recent developments in software are exploring the use of volumetric object representation to generate surfaces , and in at least one case , the use of implicit modeling via the definition of fields that then generate cellular structures . 
Mesh-based approaches can generate visually impressive lattices which conform well to the original surface design , and is relatively easily implemented for complex part geometries . 
The volumetric object representation approach allows for the user to select a unit cell from a wider variety of cellular designs . 
The repeated unit cell approach also allows relatively easy prediction of mechanical properties of the structure , easing the design process . 
A series of unit cells and corresponding repeated lattice structures are shown in 12 . 
These are all designed with the same total density , but the different designs result in different minimum feature thickness and pore sizes . 
The first four are strut-based and the next four are minimal surface designs . 
The latter are found in nature , and have been shown to have good properties for bone implant applications . 
These minimal surfaces are sheet-based designs which are often self-supporting and tend to have zero average curvature at every point on the surface , which makes for a more even distribution of stresses within these structures . 
Despite the growing prevalence of design software capable of generating cellular structure designs , it is not always apparent what the best unit cell for a specific application is and this becomes even more challenging in the context of multi-functional design . 
It is in such a context that biomimetic design can play a key role , in helping develop structure-function relationships based on observations of cellular materials in nature , and using these to guide selection of cellular materials . 
Natural cellular materials span the range of parameter space used in design , from beam or strut-based materials to surface based ones , including structures that combine both types , as shown in 13 . 
These cellular materials occur in nature both internal to a form , as well as externally on the surface . 
The main application of lattice structures , which has resulted in considerable research efforts , is their use in medical implants . 
For this application the pore sizes required are typically small , requiring small feature sizes in general . 
Other applications than medical , such as in light-weight structures for aerospace or automotive parts , might prefer thicker lattices to focus on mechanical reliability and strength . 
Experimental work with lattices with thick struts show excellent strength properties as shown in for 50 % density Ti6Al4V lattices of two strut-based designs . 
Simple strut-based lattice designs can be classified according to the Maxwell criterion as either bending-dominated or stretch-dominated as illustrated schematically and by a few examples in 14 . 
The Maxwell criterion for simple strut-based 3D structures is : M = b 3j + 6 Where b = the number of struts , and j = the number of joints When M < 0 the structure is bending-dominated When M 0 the structure is stretch-dominated and When M > 0 the structure is over-rigid Bending-dominated refers to the struts which tend to bend under compression of the lattice resulting in shear failure , while stretch-dominated structures are stiffer and fail in a layer-by-layer mechanism . 
These failure modes have been observed in relatively thick-strut lattices and imaged by microCT in their initial failure locations . 
The mechanical response of lattice structures in general follows a linear elastic response up to the first point of buckling or failure , followed by a plateau region , followed by final densification . 
This is shown in the example in 15 , which also shows why cellular materials are useful for energy absorption as they can handle significant yielding without catastrophic failure , under most circumstances . 
A lattice structure can be approximated as an open-cell foam , with effective elastic modulus E of the lattice related to the density of the structure and the elastic modulus of the bulk material - solid as follows : E = 2 E s o l i d s o l i d 2 In this relationship , the constant depends on the manufacturing accuracy and material properties and varies between 0.1 and 4 but is a constant for a specific material and process . 
What this relationship shows is that the effective elastic modulus can be controlled by the density alone this means that a lattice with unit cell design of 50 % density may use any unit cell size as long as the total space filled contains at least six unit cells in each direction then the material stiffness will be the same . 
This means lattices with many thin struts might perform the same as lattices with less thick struts , an interesting design aspect which can be varied by application requirement . 
It is also important to note that the exponent refers to ideal bending-dominated lattice while an ideal stretch-dominated lattice has exponent This is illustrated in 16 , for a range of lattice types clearly this exponent may vary somewhat depending on the lattice design selected . 
Besides the relationships mentioned above , lattice designs must also be considered relative to manufacturing limits . 
For example , sheet-based designs can typically print without supports , and strut-based designs can print without supports up to a certain strut length for horizontal struts . 
Therefore , manufacturing constraints are imposed on the design possibilities . 
The most important limits are the minimum feature size , which , in practice , is limited not only by the powder size and laser spot size , but also by the 3D model slicing accuracy and the resulting hatch and contour scanning employed . 
For example , in a recent study of thin-strut lattices , the standard processing parameters resulted in the inability to produce struts varying gradually from 0.2 to 0.4 mm . 
Here , different designs were produced with approximately the same strut dimensions despite differences in design . 
These thin-strut lattices also have relatively large surface roughness values compared to the strut thickness , which understandably affects the mechanical properties more than would be expected for a thicker-strut version . 
In this above-mentioned study the experimental elastic modulus values were significantly lower than predicted mostly attributed to surface roughness and irregularity which creates stress concentrations in notches and in locations of very thin wall thickness . 
Effectively for a metal laser powder bed fusion system with about 100 spot size , the minimum reliable wall thickness should be 0.3-0.4 mm if no special precautions or optimization for strut manufacturing is done to enhance the manufacturability . 
The next section discusses material properties and will specifically mention limits with regards to lattice manufacturability . 
6 Material properties of AM biomimetic parts Biomimetic-designed and produced parts are visually so vastly different from traditional manufactured parts , that it causes mistrust and resistance to acceptance of this new technology , especially by engineers . 
In some ways this is to be expected , as AM has a history of over-hype and under-delivery in the past . 
In the qualification process , mechanical properties of the optimized process can be tested and validated as demonstrated for Ti6Al4V in . 
In order to obtain defect-free and accurately produced parts , X-ray tomography can be used as outlined in . 
The specific process parameters which combine to create an object in AM all have an influence on the subsequent material properties and the manufacturing process of the object as a whole . 
This is true not only for fully dense objects , but also for complex or lattice design with biomimetic features such as custom or complex shapes , inner structures or surface modifications . 
In this case , material properties and the properties of i.e . 
single building blocks and joints between them also influence the properties of the LPBF object . 
Defects and flaws such as porosity occurs in the LPBF process due to various reasons and this can influence the mechanical properties of the final parts . 
There are many process parameters the laser power , laser spot size and scanning speed , hatch distance , material properties , powder particle size distribution and powder layer thickness , the strategy , design and orientation of the 3D part and its supports , the scanning and building strategy , etc . 
which all may influence the molten pool size , further solidification , microstructural grain growth and eventually the mechanical properties , lifetime and performance of LPBF parts . 
The details of the AM process are discussed in the comprehensive review paper . 
It is already well known that variation of process parameters may influence the formation of porosity and may lead to extensive flaws and build imperfections , as is shown for example in a round robin test recently . 
This highlights the need for process optimization . 
Other properties such as corrosion are also strongly affected by processing conditions and are important for biomimetic applications , especially medical applications . 
For example , it was shown that a higher corrosion resistance of Co-Cr dental alloy was obtained by Selective Laser Melting in comparison with the Selective Laser Sintering process , due to a passive oxide protecting layer which formed on the surface of the SLM sample . 
Takaichi found that metal elution from the LPBF dental implants was smaller than that of the as-cast Co-Cr alloy . 
Thus , it could be said that LPBF materials have superior corrosion properties . 
However , process-parameters can influence the corrosion behavior of samples produced with different process-parameters . 
It is already known that the level of microporosity affects the corrosion behavior as shown in . 
Micro-segregation of elements under specific LPBF process-parameters can occur causing different corrosion behavior at materials processed under different parameters . 
Since melt pool boundaries may differ in corrosion resistance compared to the center of the meltpool , more melt pool boundaries imply different corrosion resistance of LPBF material . 
These statements have to be taken into account especially for smart AM advanced biodegradable implants that should degrade with spatial and temporal controllability to meet the requirements of different bone regeneration stages . 
LPBF samples have varying surface roughness on side , top and bottom surfaces . 
Attached powder particles can be eliminated by post-process mechanical or chemical procedures . 
However , for LPBF parts with complex shapes and fine features or lattice structures , full powder evacuation and targeted accuracy and roughness values can be quite difficult to obtain . 
The surface roughness is dependent on the building and scanning strategy , material properties , powder size , layer thickness , etc . 
This can influence not only the mechanical properties but also the biological response of bone cells or soft tissues when such an object is implanted . 
Moreover , there is currently no general approach and agreement about preferred roughness values or surface micron-scale features and pore size for effective bone cell growth and functioning of implants . 
For lattice structures , the geometrical characteristics of unit cells , the building direction , overhang angles , hatch and contour scanning strategy may all influence the obtained roughness in the scaffolds and may cause deviations from designed sizes . 
For example , in du Plessis , the elemental cubic lattice was designed with a total 15 mm width , 0.75 mm strut thickness and 8 struts across one direction in total , resulting in 1.28 mm distance between struts and total 65 % porosity . 
One set of samples was built at standard process-parameters recommended for EOS Ti6Al4V in vertical direction , other ones at 45angle . 
Samples were heat-treated for stress-relieving as indicated in . 
The differences in strut thickness , roughness and microstructure is clearly visible by cross-sections and also different columnar prior beta-grain orientations are clearly present . 
Samples that were produced at 45 degrees , had 25 % lower ultimate compression strength in comparison with vertical samples . 
Bending and stretch-dominated lattices fail respectively in shear and layer-by-layer failure modes , and this might depend somewhat on the material ductility . 
For a brittle material , shear failure is not desirable and layer-by-layer can be much preferred and even might act as protective mechanism . 
The layer-by-layer mechanism is more predictable as it is known where the next failure will occur . 
In general , manufacturing imperfections might affect thin features more than thick features , hence thin struts should be thickened or well-designed with sufficient safety margin . 
The obtained texturization in LPBF materials - grain and sub-grain sizes - depend on the process-parameters used and scanning strategy in LPBF materials as shown by . 
The microstructure of LPBF solid samples and their mechanical properties , fracture and fatigue behavior have some peculiarities in as-built and heat-treated AM parts , which have been widely studied . 
For example , the columnar boundaries of prior beta-phase were observed in as-built Ti6Al4V ELI specimens and remain even after heat treatment of 950 for 2 hours . 
Anisotropy in AM is often mentioned . 
For example , the mechanical properties of LPBF Ti6Al4V ELI was found to be strongly anisotropic where three-point bending fatigue tests were used with parts produced in different orientations . 
The crack propagation rate and fatigue life of as-built and heat-treated samples correlated with column boundaries and orientation of the layers , i.e . 
correlated with the building direction . 
For static tensile tests , lower ductility was observed experimentally for the horizontal specimens in comparison with vertical samples this could be attributed to long prior beta-grain boundaries in Ti6Al4V which grow in the build direction and are hence perpendicular to the loading direction in horizontal specimens . 
As it was noted in , the orientation dependency of the ductility in AM is not yet clear and further in-depth investigations need to be done . 
Mechanical properties are dependent on building and scanning strategies and these vary for different materials . 
For example , LPBF 316 L stainless steel had maximum strength and Youngmodulus under a 45 degree offset between the layer and loading direction , whereas AlSi10Mg revealed the lowest strength in this case . 
In samples manufactured by LPBF from a nickel-based alloy , strong crystallographic texture resulting in anisotropic properties was found in creep behavior : specimens with loading parallel to the building direction were superior compared to specimens with loading axis normal to the building direction . 
The Young 's modulus determined in measurements at room and elevated temperature was different during tensile testing parallel or perpendicular to the building direction . 
The building direction and laser scanning direction / scanning strategy are important for the mechanical integrity and this adds complexity to the optimal processing protocol for parts of complex shape . 
Material type , particle size distribution and particle shape , process-parameters , protective atmosphere , building and scanning strategies , post-processing , etc . 
should all be optimized according to the specific LPBF process so that biomimetic objects can be produced with the desired properties . 
Once material properties and structural integrity have been assessed , the parts produced can be trusted , especially when suitable design safety margins have been incorporated . 
There are some general suggested guidelines based on the experiences of the authors which can be used in addition to ensure safety and reliability of biomimetic parts in real world applications : 1 For lattices , thin struts might contain micro-porosity , rough surfaces and manufacturing imperfections which affect the mechanical properties sometimes more strongly than thicker features . 
It was found that the cyclic response of lattices depend not only on the type of bulk material , but also on the roughness of the outer surface of the struts and the distribution of the micro-pores inside the struts which can both affect the crack initiation and crack propagation . 
Post processing chemical cleaning to decrease strut roughness can be used to minimize this . 
The accuracy of various AM techniques are different since different laser spot size , powder layer thickness , process-parameters as well as powder material are used . 
Therefore , for a particular purpose where mechanical properties are critical , AM lattices should be tested stringently . 
To improve mechanical performance of lattice structures for load bearing applications they must be well-designed . 
Van Bael showed that stiffness and compressive strength of lattice structures correlate well with volume fraction . 
Contuzzi proposed to use solid reinforcements in fine lattice structures that increase load carrying capability of the structure almost linearly with the number of the reinforcements . 
Bobbert proposed to use in these applications continuous sheet-based porous structures because they are expected to be less sensitive to such imperfections than beam-based porous structures , to improve fatigue resistance . 
2 For lattices , selecting lattice parameters to ensure no supports are required on the lattice or inside the lattice area is critical . 
Here , strut angles and/or length is important . 
3 For irregular geometries from topology optimization and freeform design , it is advisable to perform build-simulation to ensure no local heat accumulation occurs which might lead to residual stress and warping . 
In this process , the optimal build angle and supports should be selected . 
4 Residual stress can be minimized by design as mentioned above , and can be further improved by stress-relief heat treatment a relatively simple recommended solution . 
Heat treatment can have a decisive role on higher ductility and load bearing capacity of lattice structures and might increase fatigue life . 
5 Special attention must be given to the loading direction during use , because anisotropic mechanical properties of LPBF objects exists . 
This anisotropy might not only result from the material and its specific microstructure , but also from scanning and building strategies used for LPBF manufacturing , which might vary with different systems . 
Lattice structures built in different directions have non-identical mechanical properties . 
7 Challenges in biomimetic AM Despite all the potential for biomimicry in AM in its various forms , there are some challenges to its practical implementation . 
Most importantly , all forms of biomimetic design for AM involves complexity in various forms not previously encountered . 
While AM relaxes the traditional manufacturing rules , not any geometry or structure can be produced easily or reliably . 
Due to the complexity of design , design for AM becomes even more crucial to ensure manufacturability and might involve re-design in cases of difficult geometries . 
Metal AM and its limits in general are discussed in more detail in . 
AM is still a relatively new manufacturing process which requires process optimization and quality control to ensure accuracy and reliability . 
This requirement is critically important for parts with complex geometries which include curved surfaces , thin connecting features , hidden features and lattice structures . 
There are also many varieties of AM with different trade names , processes and differences in quality obtained . 
This quality refers in particular to material density and process induced pores , inherent process surface roughness , build errors such as uneven powder spreading or scan track errors leading to critical flaws , residual stresses and associated warping and cracking and microstructural inhomogeneity . 
A major limitation is the minimum feature size for the AM system used . 
Some additional limitations are placed on the part designs , most notably the build angles . 
All down-facing surfaces have typically rougher surfaces than upwards-facing surfaces , thin angled features suffer from stair-step effects , and small angles require supports . 
Support removal is not a simple process : this post-processing is time consuming and may also affect the dimensional accuracy and quality of the resulting part . 
When supports are needed inside a complex part , these supports might not be physically removable at all as shown in the example in 18 . 
In this figure , two topology-optimized bracket designs were almost entirely latticed but the build process required incorporation of supports also inside the lattice region . 
Removing supports from lattice regions on the exterior can cause damage to the lattice struts , and removing them from inside the lattice region is entirely impossible . 
In this case , the brackets still met the mass target despite internal supports , but the aesthetic value is not as visually impressive as could have been achieved by appropriate design to eliminate supports . 
Detailed inspection of these complex parts ensures their structural integrity and accuracy of production . 
Due to the expense involved in AM , non-destructive tools are especially useful to analyze parts without destroying them : the most widely used are X-ray techniques such as 2D digital radiography and 3D micro-computed tomography . 
Due to the complexity of the parts 2D X-ray images are difficult to interpret and smaller flaws which are typical to AM may be missed . 
As a result , microCT is often the preferred method of choice . 
This technique works by acquisition of X-ray absorption images from many angles around the object , followed by reconstruction to produce a 3D representation of the object , including its interior . 
It is also known as X-ray tomography , CT scanning or X-ray microscopy . 
The most important issues that can be identified by microCT and which are relevant to biomimetic AM are : - Powder can get stuck in complex areas , especially inside lattices , and when heat-treated they become stuck . 
This adds weight and might be unsafe . 
- Rough surfaces which depend on build angle might affect mechanical properties , with rough surfaces in inaccessible areas being unable to be processed . 
Roughness can be measured quantitatively or assessed visually . 
- Manufacturing flaws such as porosity might also occur despite process parameter optimization and this may affect the mechanical properties . 
It is important to note here that process parameter optimization prior to building a part can limit process-induced porosity and this microporosity is expected to be the same in a test coupon than in a complex part . 
- Residual stress can not directly be seen in microCT images but can be seen indirectly in the form of warping and cracks . 
Unnoticed residual stress in a part might affect its mechanical properties . 
Stress-relief heat treatment is therefore highly recommended . 
The above issues can be partially improved or solved by using AM simulations to highlight where thermal hotspots might be formed . 
A change in the build angle or design itself can contribute to eliminate these . 
Changing the lattice design or parameters can improve the requirement for supports and self-supporting lattice designs can be selected in some cases . 
Besides build orientation planning and simulation , the manufacturing process can be optimized to ensure high quality production on test cubes , which can be subjected to detailed analysis by sectioning , or preferably by microCT . 
When using microCT , however , it is also important to realize that while small porosity is acceptable when well distributed , only major flaws or those with specific location-specific clustering are important , as well as those in critical regions of the part . 
Optimization of processes using test cubes and microCT may assist in identifying the root cause of some types of defects which allows to improve the process . 
Simulations and experimental work done on lattice structures with artificially induced porosity in individual struts showed that this did not affect the yield strength of the lattice for up to 0.5 mm pores . 
8 New trends in biomimetic AM This section mentions some current interesting trends in biomimetic design for AM , with new developments expected in the next few years as the techniques are refined and new tools become available . 
The first worth mentioning is that most topology optimization software at present operates on the topology itself and subsequently certain areas can be selected for latticing , i.e . 
the latticing is not part of the simulation-driven design process . 
This latticing is incorporated into the simulation-driven design process and will find application especially in light-weighting applications . 
The other useful development is the optimization of repeated lattices gradient lattices and variations of strut thickness or unit cell size across a part , and conformal lattices to the surfaces of a part . 
In other words , the lattice is not simply cut off on the edge of the part but unit cells are stretched to fit the surface topology . 
An example hereof is shown in 21 where the lattice is conformal to two opposing surfaces and the lattice density varies to allow denser lattice in areas where simulations show higher stress will be experienced . 
Recent research approaches for cellular material design have included the development of multi-scale optimization approaches as described by Osanov and Guest and Cadman . 
In this approach , the unit cell domain is discretized into elements which are then themselves optimized using topology optimization methods , similar to discussions in the previous section . 
A unit cell so designed can then be used to compute effective properties , after which inverse homogenization is used to upscale the cellular geometry to the level of the larger structure . 
These ideas have been recently extended to multi-material cellular structure optimization . 
Cellular automata methods have also been developed to design materials and microstructures , and machine learning methods are beginning to be applied to materials design . 
Because of the very complex shapes of the parts having a biomimetic or bionic design , it is often necessary to use support structures for overhanging areas . 
This can be a big problem in the post processing of these parts for removing the supports and surface finishing . 
On the other hand , internal complexity and small features are limited in this process , since with constant preheating of each layer to a high temperature , the powder is partially sintered and later can not be removed from the manufactured part . 
There are also quite serious limitations on materials for EBM technology . 
Also recently , companies such as EOS and Velo3D have improved their softwares , scanning strategies and process control parameters , which allowed to realize designs with overhangs lower than 15and large inner diameters without supports . 
These developments are all very promising for the realization of increasingly complex biomimetic designs with improved structural integrity and surface quality . 
An emerging trend is the development of software packages incorporating the entire workflow for advanced design for AM , including freeform design , topology optimization , latticing and more recently also build simulation and even support generation and slicing for build preparation . 
When all this is combined in one workspace the entire design process is simplified and this allows more frequent and improved biomimetic designs to be realized in practice . 
The development of standards for AM and non-destructive testing in AM is emerging as an important aspect in the qualification of processes and ensuring reliability in AM processes . 
This is especially applicable to biomimetic designs and it holds the most advantage in optimizing process parameters prior to building complex parts - using microCT test methods . 
Inspecting complex parts is also valuable in critical parts such as for aerospace , and microCT is the best method to do this . 
It is worth mentioning that besides complex part inspections , which are limited in resolution by field of view , it is becoming standard practice to inspect witness specimens of smaller diameter built alongside complex parts . 
This allows for high resolution CT analysis with defects found in these specimens being indicative of problems encountered during the build . 
Something that is becoming increasingly popular for improving part density is the use of hot isostatic pressing , especially for additively-manufactured metal parts for aerospace it is a requirement that all parts are HIPped . 
The HIP process closes pores and improves the microstructure , but it is important to realize that not all pores are necessarily closed by HIP : it has been shown that pores connected to the surface do not close properly , and is detectable by microCT . 
The important point is that HIP should not be used as a blind solution its performance especially in thin walled parts should be checked . 
In general , the use of biomimetic AM is growing at a very fast rate , with practical engineering applications emerging almost daily . 
This is driven by the maturation of metal powder bed fusion AM , the development of appropriate software tools , and the huge interest from companies in investing in a technology with clear potential to disrupt various industries . 
The key to disrupting existing products is in significant advantages in the new design which is possible by AM and biomimicry is key to unlocking this potential . 
Besides aesthetic appeal , actual light-weight advantage is likely the biggest drawcard in automotive and aerospace industries . 
In other industries the combination of multiple parts into one might be a significant advantage and it is expected that the multi-functionality of designs might be one of the big future growth areas . 
9 Conclusions It is clear that biomimicry in AM allows complex functional designs and various tools are currently available to easily achieve such designs . 
Biomimetic designs are therefore both beautiful and functional . 
Despite the high possible complexity , some design for AM rules have emerged which improve the manufacturability and reliability of these types of parts and these should be incorporated into the design process . 
It is especially important that process parameters are optimized to ensure structural integrity and ensure high quality manufacturing , as manufacturing errors might affect these parts more than traditional parts this requires an additional safety factor to be built into designs , and inspection is critical . 
Post-processing of parts is also a challenge , and the options are limited therefore depending on the application the complexity of the design might need to be constrained to ensure all surfaces are accessible by required post-processing techniques . 
One of the most widely used applications of biomimetic design in AM is light-weighting , but many other opportunities exist including parts customized for acoustic , thermal , optical or other applications , especially in combination with surface modification techniques . 
Most importantly , all examples in this work clearly demonstrate that biomimetic designs can be trusted and should be used more widely . 
Biomimetic designs are crucial for fully unlocking the power of metal AM in particular . 
In conclusion , biomimicry in AM has been shown to be possible in various ways , with the most accessible tools currently being freeform design and simulation-driven design . 
These tools allow complex forms to be created which often resemble natural structures , and the design engineer may incorporate from naturein this design process . 
For example , in simulation-driven design , various outcomes are possible and selection of the design outcome most similar to a biological structure is most likely the best solution . 
The greatest future potential for biomimicry in AM lies in incorporating real biological input in some ways in the design process and here biological materials science is crucial in providing from naturewhich can be incorporated easily . 
It is not only in the design process where biomimicry can be employed . 
The entire process of 3D printing may follow biological principles , including sustainability . 
Biomimetic design therefore forms part of and drives the bio-industrial revolution which will become known as Industry 5.0 .

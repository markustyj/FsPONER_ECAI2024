is O
achieved O
in O
the O

The O
surface B-MANP
finishing E-MANP
of O
internal O

Therefore O
, O
we O
propose O
a O
novel O

, O
we O
performed O

We O

In O

, O
we O

Finally O
, O
we O
discussed O
the O
significance O
of O
using O
the O
proposed O
HCAF O
process S-CONPRI
for O
complex O
additive B-MANP

can O
produce O
very O
complex O

that O
can O
not O
be S-MATE

The O
aim O
of O
this O

was O
to O
find O
out O
the O
laser S-ENAT

of O
the O
printed O
AlSi10Mg S-MATE
material O
without O

The O
laser S-ENAT
used O
in O
these O
welding S-MANP
experiments O
was O
Yb S-MATE

laser S-ENAT
. O


The O
laser S-ENAT

was O
1030 O
nm O
and O
the O
maximum O
output O
power S-PARA
on O
the O
workpiece S-CONPRI
surface S-CONPRI
was O
4 O

. O


AlSi10Mg S-MATE
is O
a O
widely O
used O
material S-MATE
in O
parts O
that O
are O
produced O
utilizing O
the O

AlSi10Mg S-MATE
has O
proven O
to O
be S-MATE
much O
easier O
to O
print S-MANP
than O
steel B-MATE
materials E-MATE
, O
so O
it O
is O
a O
popular O
material S-MATE
also O
in O

Based O
on O

tests O
, O
laser B-MANP

suitable O
for O
AlSi10Mg S-MATE

the O
static O
strength S-PRO
of O
the O
weld S-FEAT
is O
reasonably O
good O
compared O
to O
the O
base O
material S-MATE
. O


However O
, O
AlSi10Mg S-MATE
can O
be S-MATE
found O
to O
be S-MATE
challenging O
due O
to O
its O
composition S-CONPRI
. O

The O

and O
the O

that O
are O
exposed O
below O
with O
the O

of O
some O
new O
economic B-CONPRI
activities E-CONPRI
. O


The O
first O
method O
to O
create O
a O
three-dimensional S-CONPRI
object O
layer B-CONPRI
by I-CONPRI
layer E-CONPRI
using O
computer-aided B-ENAT
design E-ENAT
( O
CAD S-ENAT
) O
was O
rapid B-ENAT
prototyping E-ENAT
, O
developed O
in O
the O
1980s O
to O
produce O
models O
and O
prototype S-CONPRI
parts O
. O


The O
main O
advantage O
of O
the O
Additive B-MANP
Manufacturing E-MANP
( O
AM S-MANP
) O
is O
its O
ability O
to O
create O
almost O
any O
possible O
shape O
and O
this O
capacity S-CONPRI
is O
run O
by O
the O
layer-by-layer S-CONPRI
manufacturing O
. O


AM B-MANP
technology E-MANP
is O
most O
commonly O
used O
for O
modelling S-ENAT
, O
prototyping S-CONPRI
, O
tooling S-CONPRI
through O
an O
exclusive O
machine S-MACEQ
or O
3D B-MACEQ
printer E-MACEQ
. O


AM S-MANP
is O
largely O
used O
for O
manufacturing S-MANP
short-term O
prototypes S-CONPRI
but O
it O
is O
also O
used O
for O
small-scale O
series O
production S-MANP
and O
tooling S-CONPRI
applications O
( O
Rapid B-MANP
Tooling E-MANP
) O
. O


This O
technology S-CONPRI
was O
created O
to O
help O
and O
support S-APPL
the O
engineers O
in O
their O
conceptualisation S-CONPRI
. O


Among O
the O
major O
advances O
that O
this O
process S-CONPRI
presented O
to O
product B-CONPRI
development E-CONPRI
are O
the O
time O
and O
cost B-CONPRI
reduction E-CONPRI
, O
human B-CONPRI

, O
and O
consequently O

Those O
shapes O
could O
indeed O
be S-MATE
very O
difficult O
to O
manufacture S-CONPRI
with O
other O
processes S-CONPRI
( O
e.g O
. O


milling S-MANP
, O
moulding S-CONPRI
) O
. O


The O
complex B-CONPRI
geometries E-CONPRI
or O
the O
curved B-CONPRI
surfaces E-CONPRI
needed O
have O
to O
be S-MATE
maintained O
with O
a O
support B-MATE
material E-MATE
. O


The O
feedback S-PARA
has O
a O
great O
influence O
on O
the O
quality S-CONPRI
or O
effectiveness S-CONPRI
of O
the O
manufactured S-CONPRI

. O


From O
one O
technology S-CONPRI
to O
another O
, O
the O
manufacture B-CONPRI
direction E-CONPRI
, O
the O

and O
the O

are O
important O
to O
get O
an O
accurate S-CHAR
model O
and O
an O
efficient O
production S-MANP
. O


Nowadays O
, O
these O
technologies S-CONPRI
have O
other O
names O
such O
as S-MATE
3D B-MANP

, O
and O
so O
forth O
, O
but O
they O
all O
have O
the O
same O
origins O
from O
rapid B-ENAT
prototyping E-ENAT
. O


The O
demand O
of O
AM B-MACEQ
machines E-MACEQ
is O
increasingly O
growing O
since O
the O
1990s O
. O


Due O
to O
the O
evolution S-CONPRI
of O
rapid B-ENAT
prototyping E-ENAT
technologies O
, O
it O
has O
become O
possible O
to O
obtain O
parts O
representative O
of O
a O
mass B-CONPRI
production E-CONPRI
within O
a O
very O
short O
time O
. O


AM S-MANP
perfectly O
fits S-CONPRI
into O
the O
numerical B-CONPRI
design E-CONPRI
and O
manufacturing B-CONPRI
chain E-CONPRI
. O


AM S-MANP
is O
very O
complementary O
with O
the O
reverse B-CONPRI
engineering E-CONPRI
to O
reproduce O
or O
repair O
a O
model S-CONPRI
. O


Many O
rapid B-ENAT

technologies O
have O
appeared O
on O
the O
market O
based O
on O
the O
same O
layers B-MANP

approach O
. O


AM S-MANP
or O
3D B-MANP

have O
strongly O
been O
developed O
and O
currently O
propose O
several O
solutions O
. O


Use O
of O
AM S-MANP
leads O
to O
new O
practices O
in O
different O
domains O
which O
push O
the O
manufacturer S-CONPRI
to O
adapt O
. O


The O
evolution S-CONPRI
of O
AM B-MANP
technologies E-MANP
also O
leads O
to O
news O
solutions O
driven O
by O
very O
strong O

. O


Use O

We O
propose O
to O
realise O
a O
technologic S-CONPRI
review O
of O
manufacturing B-MANP
processes E-MANP
followed O
by O
their O
illustrative O
scheme O
. O


We O
have O
chosen O
to O
classify O
the O
AM S-MANP
by O
manufacturing B-MANP
technologies E-MANP
to O
explain O
them O
. O


First O
of O
all O
, O
we O
will O
describe O
the O

before O
the O

while O
involving O
some O
industrial S-APPL
and O
academic O
trends S-CONPRI
. O


The O
stages O
involved O
to O
the O
product B-FEAT
design E-FEAT
and O
the O
rapid B-ENAT
prototyping E-ENAT
show O
that O
the O
cycle B-CONPRI
development E-CONPRI
is O
specific O
. O


These O
rapid B-ENAT
prototyping E-ENAT
processes S-CONPRI
generally O
consist O
of O
a O
substance S-CONPRI
, O
such O
as S-MATE

, O
waxes S-MATE

. O


There O
exist O
two O
possibilities O
to O
start O
an O
AM S-MANP
cycle O
, O
begin O
with O
a O
virtual B-ENAT

or O
a O

. O


The O

can O
be S-MATE

it O
requires O

through O
a O

The O
process S-CONPRI

with O
a O

before O

In O
most O
cases O

thanks O
to O

The O

sometimes O
includes O
a O

of O
the O
main O

Rapid B-ENAT

techniques O
are O
classified O
in O
two O
categories O
: O
subtractive S-MANP
, O
and O
additive S-MATE
. O


Subtractive S-MANP
technologies O
work O
by O
removing O
raw B-MATE
material E-MATE
out O
of O
a O
workpiece S-CONPRI
until O
the O
desired O
shape O
is O
obtained O
. O


They O
include O
cutting S-MANP
( O
laser-cutting S-MANP
or O
water-jet B-MANP
cutting E-MANP
) O
and O
machining S-MANP
( O
lathing S-MANP
and O
milling S-MANP
) O
. O


Conversely O
, O
the O
additive B-ENAT
technologies E-ENAT
work O
by O
adding O
of O
the O
raw B-MATE
material E-MATE
. O


Modelling S-ENAT
is O
a O
very O
important O
step S-CONPRI
in O
AM S-MANP
because O
it O
shapes O
the O
product O
but O
it O
also O
must O
take O
in O
account O
some O
knowledge O
since O
the O
experiments O
and O

are O
costly O
. O


Various O

coexist O
so O
that O

. O


The O

an O

2.1 O
AM B-MANP
processes E-MANP
According O
to O
ISO/ASTM S-MANS
there O
are O
currently O
seven O
AM B-MANP
process E-MANP
categories O
that O
result O
in O
a O
3D S-CONPRI
CAD O
model S-CONPRI
being O
formed O
into O
a O
solid O
, O
integrated O
part O
: O
Binder B-MANP
jetting E-MANP
: O
droplet S-CONPRI
printing O
of O
a O
liquid O
used O
to O
bind S-MANP
powder O
particles S-CONPRI
together O
; O
Directed B-MANP
energy I-MANP
deposition E-MANP
: O
material S-MATE
is O
simultaneously O
fed O
into O
a O
moving O
focused O
energy O
region O
; O
Material B-MANP
extrusion E-MANP
: O
material S-MATE
is O
fed O
through O
a O
nozzle S-MACEQ
in O
a O
liquid B-CONPRI
state E-CONPRI
after O
which O
solidifies O
; O
Material B-MANP
jetting E-MANP
: O
material S-MATE
is O
jetted O
in O
liquid B-CONPRI
droplet I-CONPRI
form E-CONPRI
after O
which O
it O
solidifies O
; O
Powder B-MANP
bed I-MANP
fusion E-MANP
: O
powder B-MATE
material E-MATE
is O
selectively O
heated O
so O
that O
the O
particles S-CONPRI
partially O
or O
fully O
melt S-CONPRI
to O
form O
a O
solid B-CONPRI
matrix E-CONPRI
; O
Sheet B-MANP
lamination E-MANP
: O
sheets S-MATE
of O
material S-MATE
are O
bonded O
together O
either O
before O
or O
after O
the O
part O
outline O
is O
separated O
from O
the O
sheets S-MATE
; O
Vat B-MANP
photopolymerisation E-MANP
: O
a O
platform S-MACEQ
is O
dropped O
through O
or O
raised O
above O
a O
vat S-MACEQ
of O
liquid O
resin S-MATE
where O
light O
is O
used O
to O
selectively O
solidify S-CONPRI
it O
. O


Most O
of O
these O
categories O
have O
so O
far O
resulted O
mainly O
in O
machines S-MACEQ
that O
are O
designed S-FEAT
for O
one-off O
prototypes S-CONPRI
or O
for O
production S-MANP
that O
heavily O
employs O
manual O
work O
. O


Whilst O
the O
AM B-MANP
technology E-MANP
itself O
is O
largely O
automated O
, O
the O
design B-CONPRI
process E-CONPRI
, O
machine B-MACEQ
setup E-MACEQ
and O
finishing S-MANP
stages O
may O
require O
a O
significant O
amount O
of O
knowledge O
and O
skills O
to O
perform O
. O


All O
the O
above O
processes S-CONPRI
were O
initially O
developed O
to O
create O
parts O
from O
different O
polymeric B-MATE
materials E-MATE
, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
sheet B-MANP
lamination E-MANP
. O


Some O
of O
these O
technologies S-CONPRI
have O
now O
been O
developed O
to O
a O
level O
where O
they O
have O
been O
incorporated O
into O
large O
batch B-CONPRI
production E-CONPRI
. O


Some O
of O
these O
batches O
can O
be S-MATE
considered O
to O
be S-MATE
part O
of O
a O
continuous B-MANP
production I-MANP
line E-MANP
. O


The O
most O
well-known O
of O
these O
would O
be S-MATE
AM B-MACEQ
machines E-MACEQ
used O
in O
production S-MANP
of O
teeth O
aligners O
and O
hearing B-APPL
aids E-APPL
. O


These O
examples O
show O
that O
when O
the O
additional O
complexity S-CONPRI
of O
form O
and/or O
the O
individual O
part O
cost O
allows O
it O
, O
AM S-MANP
can O
be S-MATE
used O
for O
final O
part O
production S-MANP
of O
parts O
. O


The O
impact S-CONPRI
of O
AM S-MANP
on O
process B-ENAT
chain E-ENAT
towards O
final O
production S-MANP
is O
however O
most O
heavily O
felt O
when O
producing O
metal S-MATE
parts O
. O


All O
of O
the O
above O
process S-CONPRI
categories O
have O
a O
means O
in O
which O
to O
arrive O
at O
a O
metal S-MATE
part O
. O


The O
first O
approach O
is O
by O
mixing S-CONPRI
metal S-MATE
particles O
with O
the O
material B-FEAT
joining E-FEAT
mechanism O
. O


For O
example O
, O
metal S-MATE
particles O
can O
be S-MATE
added O
to O
photopolymers S-MATE
in O
vat B-MANP
photopolymerisation E-MANP
or O
mixed O
with O
polymer S-MATE
powder O
in O
powder B-MANP
bed I-MANP
fusion E-MANP
or O
with O
filament S-MATE
in O
material B-MANP
extrusion E-MANP
. O


In O
general O
this O
will O
end O
in O
a O
blended O
part O
that O
exhibits O
some O
of O
the O
properties S-CONPRI
of O
the O
metal S-MATE
like O
improved O
surface S-CONPRI
hardness S-PRO
or O
heat B-CONPRI
deflection E-CONPRI
. O


The O
second O
approach O
is O
where O
the O
parts O
above O
are O
used O
in O
a O
secondary O
furnace S-MACEQ
cycle O
to O
burn O
off O
the O
polymer S-MATE
and O
cause O
the O
metal S-MATE
particles O
to O
sinter S-MANP
together O
. O


This O
process S-CONPRI
therefore O
requires O
an O
additional O
programmable O
furnace S-MACEQ
to O
achieve O
this O
effect O
. O


In O
addition O
to O
the O
process S-CONPRI
categories O
mentioned O
in O
the O
previous O
paragraph O
, O
binder B-MANP
jetting E-MANP
is O
also O
widely O
used O
in O
this O
manner O
. O


It O
should O
be S-MATE
noted O
in O
particular O
that O
part O
shrinkage S-CONPRI
will O
occur O
using O
this O
approach O
. O


This O
shrinkage S-CONPRI
can O
be S-MATE
minimised O
if O
an O
infiltrant O
is O
used O
to O
fill O
in O
voids S-CONPRI
prior O
to O
densification S-MANP
. O


For O
example O
420 B-MATE
stainless I-MATE
steel E-MATE
parts O
can O
be S-MATE
infiltrated O
with O
bronze S-MATE
at O
1100 O
. O


Many O
technologies S-CONPRI
have O
been O
refined O
to O
a O
level O
where O
geometric B-FEAT
tolerances E-FEAT
are O
highly O
predictable S-CONPRI
and O
achieving O
up O
to O
97 O
% O
final O
density S-PRO
values O
. O


Conventional O
polymer S-MATE
AM B-MATE
materials E-MATE
can O
often O
be S-MATE
used O
in O
casting S-MANP
processes O
to O
achieve O
metal S-MATE
parts O
. O


Some O
of O
the O
original O
processes S-CONPRI
were O
developed O
around O
waxes S-MATE
as S-MATE
a O
means O
to O
integrate O
with O
conventional B-MANP
investment I-MANP
casting E-MANP
. O


It O
was O
found O
later O
that O
other O
, O
stronger O
polymers S-MATE
could O
be S-MATE
used O
in O
this O
way O
provided O
the O
casting B-MACEQ
shells E-MACEQ
were O
strengthened O
and O
the O
burnout B-CHAR
conditions E-CHAR
were O
modified O
. O


Four O
of O
the O
above O
process S-CONPRI
categories O
can O
directly O
produce O
metal S-MATE
parts O
; O
powder B-MANP
bed I-MANP
fusion E-MANP
, O
directed B-MANP
energy I-MANP
deposition E-MANP
, O
material B-MANP
jetting E-MANP
, O
and O
sheet B-MANP
lamination E-MANP
. O


It O
is O
interesting O
to O
note O
that O
sheet B-MANP
lamination E-MANP
is O
largely O
a O
hybrid O
process S-CONPRI
. O


In O
sheet B-MANP
lamination E-MANP
there O
can O
be S-MATE
a O
large O
amount O
of O
material S-MATE
, O
often O
much O
more O
than O
is O
used O
for O
the O
part O
itself O
, O
that O
is O
separated O
from O
the O
part O
in O
a O
subtractive S-MANP
manner O
during O
the O
AM B-MANP
process E-MANP
. O


These O
sheets S-MATE
can O
be S-MATE
metal O
and O
bonded O
together O
using O
ultrasonic B-MANP
bonding E-MANP
. O


This O
is O
a O
low O
temperature S-PARA
welding O
process S-CONPRI
for O
joining S-MANP
dissimular O
metals S-MATE
and O
can O
for O
example O
allow O
embedding O
of O
electronics S-CONPRI
in O
the O
structure S-CONPRI
without O
damaging O
it O
. O


It O
is O
a O
niche O
AM S-MANP
route O
towards O
metal S-MATE
parts O
. O


By O
far O
the O
most O
widely O
used O
AM S-MANP
approach O
for O
metal S-MATE
parts O
is O
powder B-MANP
bed I-MANP
fusion E-MANP
. O


This O
is O
largely O
because O
of O
the O
basic O
simplicity O
of O
the O
process S-CONPRI
combined O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
a O
range S-PARA
metals S-MATE
is O
readily O
available O
and O
suitable O
for O
mainstream O
applications O
. O


A O
beam S-MACEQ
of O
energy O
is O
used O
to O
selectively O
melt S-CONPRI
the O
powders S-MATE
to O
form O
the O
solid O
part O
. O


Electron B-MANP
beam I-MANP
melting E-MANP
is O
available O
but O
most O
systems O
use O
laser B-CONPRI
energy E-CONPRI
, O
normally O
in O
a O
sealed O
chamber O
, O
in O
an O
inert B-CONPRI
gas E-CONPRI
environment O
or O
a O
vacuum O
. O


This O
sealed O
chamber O
may O
be S-MATE
at O
an O
elevated O
temperature S-PARA
but O
still O
considerably O
below O
the O
melting B-PRO
point E-PRO
of O
the O
metal S-MATE
. O


Since O
this O
means O
very O
large O
thermal B-PARA
gradients E-PARA
, O
it O
is O
normal O
to O
connect O
the O
parts O
to O
a O
solid B-MACEQ
substrate E-MACEQ
in O
a O
similar O
way O
to O
processes S-CONPRI
that O
require O
support B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
. O


These O
supports S-APPL
have O
a O
different O
purpose O
in O
that O
they O
anchor O
the O
part O
to O
prevent O
internal B-PRO
stress E-PRO
warpage O
during O
build S-PARA
. O


Directed B-MANP
energy I-MANP
deposition E-MANP
is O
a O
process S-CONPRI
that O
almost O
entirely O
focuses O
on O
metal S-MATE
parts O
. O


A O
high O
energy O
source S-APPL
is O
used O
to O
melt S-CONPRI
metals O
that O
are O
delivered O
in O
either O
powder S-MATE
or O
wire O
form O
. O


The O
energy B-FEAT
focal I-FEAT
point E-FEAT
is O
also O
where O
the O
material S-MATE
is O
delivered O
and O
so O
there O
is O
a O
periodic O
melting S-MANP
followed O
by O
rapid B-MANP
solidification E-MANP
. O


Similar O
issues O
to O
powder B-MANP
bed I-MANP
fusion E-MANP
exist O
regarding O
residual B-PRO
stresses E-PRO
with O
the O
additional O
complexity S-CONPRI
of O
a O
significantly O
varying O
thermal O
environment O
. O


Since O
there O
is O
no O
surrounding O
powder S-MATE
to O
help O
stabilise O
the O
heat B-CONPRI
transfer E-CONPRI
, O
the O
directed B-MANP
energy I-MANP
deposition I-MANP
process E-MANP
will O
have O
differing O
cooling S-MANP
profiles O
dependent O
on O
the O
mass O
of O
surrounding O
material S-MATE
at O
the O
energy O
delivery O
point O
. O


Material B-MANP
jetting E-MANP
for O
the O
production S-MANP
of O
metal S-MATE
parts O
is O
hampered O
by O
the O
high O
temperatures S-PARA
needed O
to O
get O
the O
metals S-MATE
in O
the O

2.3 O
AM S-MANP

stages O
As S-MATE
mentioned O
in O
Thompson O
, O
the O
AM S-MANP
design O
process S-CONPRI
has O
to O
take O
into O
account O
a O
lot O
of O
aspects O
related O
to O
several O
key O

the O
AM S-MANP
design O
steps O
can O
be S-MATE
structured O
into O
three O
global O
stages O
. O


The O
first O
stage O
relates O
to O
go/no-go O
evaluations O
concerning O
the O
part O
, O
tool S-MACEQ
or O
product O
to O
be S-MATE
considered O
. O


Manufacturability S-CONPRI
issues O
will O
have O
to O
be S-MATE
checked O
at O
this O
stage O
even O
before O
defining O
any O
geometry S-CONPRI
. O


Before O
that O
, O
however O
, O
crucial O
decisions O
must O
be S-MATE
made O
with O
respect O
to O
functional O
decomposition S-PRO
and O
functional O
integration O
. O


One O
later O
decision O
will O
be S-MATE
to O
define O
the O
complete O
manufacturing S-MANP
for O
each O
feature S-FEAT
as S-MATE
well O
as S-MATE
the O
scheduling O
of O
the O
individual O
manufacturing S-MANP
operations O
, O
with O
possible O
use O
of O
different O
manufacturing B-MANP
technologies E-MANP
. O


The O
material S-MATE
and O
its O
characteristics O
will O
also O
have O
to O
be S-MATE
defined O
for O
each O
voxel S-CONPRI
of O
the O
part O
. O


The O
definition O
of O
the O
material S-MATE
characteristics O
must O
be S-MATE
fixed O
as S-MATE
well O
as S-MATE
the O
definition O
of O
transitions O
between O
different O
materials S-CONPRI
in O
different O
regions O
of O
the O
objects O
. O


These O
possibilities O
are O
limited O
to O
AM B-MANP
technologies E-MANP
that O
allow O
assembly S-MANP
of O
different O
materials S-CONPRI
or O
grading O
material S-MATE
characteristics O
in O
a O
given O
part O
. O


The O
third O
stage O
corresponds O
to O
the O
final O
check O
and O
optimization S-CONPRI
of O
process S-CONPRI
characteristics O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
best O
possible O
properties S-CONPRI
of O
the O
manufactured S-CONPRI
objects O
. O


For O
example O
, O
the O
number O
of O
parts O
produced O
is O
dependent O
on O
the O
choice O
of O
orientation S-CONPRI
of O
the O
part O
and O
consequently O
on O
the O
support B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
that O
are O
minimized O
with O
respect O
to O
an O
optimum O
part O
geometry S-CONPRI
. O


These O
three O
global O
design S-FEAT
stages O
serve O
to O
minimize O
the O
technical O
and O
economic O
risks O
before O
going O
to O
manufacturing S-MANP
. O


Design S-FEAT
does O
not O
therefore O
just O
rely O
on O
a O
simple S-MANP
set S-APPL
of O
design S-FEAT
guidelines O
. O


A O
global O
and O
systemic O
vision O
of O
the O
complete O

has O
to O
be S-MATE
considered O
with O
respect O
to O
global O

like O
in O

Process B-CONPRI
planning E-CONPRI
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
activities O
in O
manufacturing S-MANP
planning O
and O
is O
a O
pivotal O
link O
between O

and O
manufacturing S-MANP
. O


Compared O
to O
traditional O

, O
the O

Manufacturing E-MANP
, O
but O
it O
is O
still O
within O
the O
manufacturing S-MANP
scope O
. O


Although O
AM B-MACEQ
machines E-MACEQ
are O
highly O
integrated O
and O
automatic O
, O
before O
enabling O
the O
building B-CHAR
process E-CHAR
for O
a O
machine S-MACEQ
, O
there O
are O
also O
some O
preparation O
tasks O
that O
should O
be S-MATE
done O
after O
receiving O
a O
design S-FEAT

and O
its O

required O
when O

be S-MATE

3D S-CONPRI
set O

In O
some O
cases O
this O

is O
very O
different O
because O
the O
orientation S-CONPRI

. O


In O
such O
cases O
, O
the O

Alternative O
operations O

as S-MATE
an O
alternative O

However O

have O
to O
be S-MATE
validated O
with O
respect O
to O
global O

conditions O
of O

As S-MATE
material O
and O

are O
obtained O
at O
the O

, O
it O

and O
the O

Consequently O

For O
some O

This O
occurs O
when O

3.5 O
AM B-MANP
process E-MANP
constraints O
Like O
with O
all O
technologies S-CONPRI
, O
there O
are O
many O
constraints O
to O
AM S-MANP
. O


This O
section O
will O
focus O
on O
four O
primary O
constraints O
that O
are O
common O
to O
all O
AM B-MANP
process E-MANP
categories O
and O
particularly O
relevant O
to O
the O
AM S-MANP
of O
metals S-MATE
: O
Speed O
of O
build S-PARA
, O
materials S-CONPRI
, O
build B-PARA
envelope E-PARA
, O
and O
accuracy S-CHAR
. O


Although O
AM S-MANP
used O
to O
be S-MATE
called O
Rapid B-ENAT
Prototyping E-ENAT
, O
one O
is O
now O
quite O
accustomed O
to O
having O
prototypes S-CONPRI
built O
quickly O
, O
but O
this O
is O
difficult O
to O
scale O
up O
. O


Furthermore O
, O
there O
is O
increasing O
demand O
for O
AM S-MANP
to O
be S-MATE
used O
in O
mainstream O
production S-MANP
, O
which O
requires O
much O
faster O
throughput S-CHAR
. O


AM S-MANP
has O
the O
benefits O
of O
geometric B-CONPRI
freedom E-CONPRI
, O
no O
minimum O
batch O
constraint O
and O
rapid O
change O
between O
batches O
, O
which O
meets O
many O
of O
the O
demands O
of O
modern O
manufacturing S-MANP
industry S-APPL
. O


The O
hunt O
is O
therefore O
on O
for O
faster O
AM B-MANP
technology E-MANP
. O


Many O
metal B-MANP
AM E-MANP
systems O
use O
lasers O
due O
to O
the O
demand O
for O
large O
amounts O
of O
focussed O
energy O
. O


The O
ideal O
situation O
would O
be S-MATE
to O
provide O
the O
required O
energy O
over O
an O
entire O
layer S-PARA
simultaneously O
but O
so O
far O
this O
has O
not O
been O
demonstrated O
to O
be S-MATE
possible O
. O


A O
compromise O
is O
the O
supply O
of O
multiple O
laser B-CONPRI
beams E-CONPRI
controlled O
simultaneously O
. O


Different O
lasers O
can O
be S-MATE
used O
to O
process S-CONPRI
different O
regions O
with O
finer B-CHAR
spots E-CHAR
being O
used O
for O
more O
detailed O
parts O
and O
wider O
beams O
to O
process S-CONPRI
bulk B-FEAT
regions E-FEAT
. O


Careful O
attention O
must O
be S-MATE
given O
to O
beam B-PARA
control E-PARA
so O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
affect O
each O
other O
, O
including O
the O
vapour O
trails O
from O
the O
molten B-MATE
metal E-MATE
regions O
. O


A O
contrasting O
approach O
to O
increasing O
throughput S-CHAR
for O
batch B-CONPRI
production E-CONPRI
of O
metal S-MATE
parts O
is O
the O
use O
of O
binder B-MANP
jetting I-MANP
methods E-MANP
or O
material B-MANP
extrusion E-MANP
with O
metal-filled O
binder S-MATE
materials O
. O


Such O
methods O
can O
achieve O
faster O
AM S-MANP
throughput O
and O
can O
be S-MATE
more O
easily O
scaled O
to O
create O
larger O
parts O
. O


The O
downsides O
relate O
to O
increases O
in O
post-processing S-CONPRI
times O
during O
heat B-MANP
treatment E-MANP
and O
during O
machine S-MACEQ
finishing S-MANP
, O
if O
required O
. O


These O
requirements O
are O
also O
driving O
the O
development O
of O
open-architecture O
, O
robot-based O
metal B-MANP
AM E-MANP
systems O
, O
like O
Wire O
Arc S-CONPRI
AM S-MANP
and O
Laser B-MANP
Metal I-MANP
Deposition E-MANP
. O


There O
is O
a O
huge O
and O
increasing O
number O
of O
metals S-MATE
and O
other O
materials S-CONPRI
used O
to O
make O
products O
. O


Most O
of O
these O
metals S-MATE
are O
carefully O
chosen O
to O
suit O
product O
requirements O
in O
strength S-PRO
, O
chemical B-PRO
resistance E-PRO
, O
thermal B-CONPRI
properties E-CONPRI
, O
processability O
, O
cost O
, O
etc O
. O


In O
comparison O
, O
there O
are O
a O
very O
few O
materials S-CONPRI
available O
in O
AM S-MANP
. O


All O
AM B-MANP
processes E-MANP
are O
suited O
to O
a O
subset O
of O
materials S-CONPRI
, O
the O
requirements O
for O
which O
can O
be S-MATE
very O
specific O
, O
like O
the O
need O
for O
photo-curable B-MATE
resins E-MATE
. O


Many O
materials S-CONPRI
can O
be S-MATE
formed O
by O
AM S-MANP
using O
thermal B-CONPRI
energy E-CONPRI
, O
but O
the O
amounts O
of O
energy O
vary O
considerably O
. O


It O
is O
not O
easy O
to O
melt S-CONPRI
metals O
in O
an O
AM B-MANP
process E-MANP
chamber O
specifically O
built O
for O
polymers S-MATE
for O
example O
. O


In O
addition O
, O
raw B-MATE
materials E-MATE
often O
need O
to O
be S-MATE
presented O
with O
well-defined O
morphology S-CONPRI
, O
like O
in O
filament S-MATE
or O
carefully-graded O
powder S-MATE
distributions S-CONPRI
. O


However O
, O
even O
within O
a O
smaller O
range S-PARA
of O
materials S-CONPRI
the O
processing O
requirements O
can O
still O
be S-MATE
difficult O
to O
specify O
. O


Metals S-MATE
within O
L-PBF B-MACEQ
systems E-MACEQ
for O
example O
will O
absorb O
laser B-CONPRI
energy E-CONPRI
in O
different O
proportions O
. O


The O
physics S-CONPRI
around O
phase S-CONPRI
change O
behaviour O
and O
effects O
in O
the O
molten O
state O
can O
all O
be S-MATE
quite O
different O
, O
significantly O
affecting O
the O
final O
material S-MATE
microstructure O
. O


Furthermore O
, O
much O
of O
this O
is O
significantly O
different O
from O
other O
manufacturing B-MANP
processes E-MANP
like O
casting S-MANP
and O
forging S-MANP
. O


All O
these O
need O
to O
be S-MATE
carefully O
studied O
before O
AM B-MATE
materials E-MATE
can O
be S-MATE
released O
to O
the O
market O
. O


As S-MATE
, O
AM S-MANP
becomes O
more O
widespread O
, O
one O
can O
expect O
more O
materials S-CONPRI
to O
become O
available O
but O
it O
is O
widely O
accepted O
that O
range S-PARA
of O
materials S-CONPRI
needs O
to O
be S-MATE
increased O
. O


Having O
said O
that O
, O
current O
AM B-MATE
materials E-MATE
like O
Ti-6Al-4V S-MATE
, O
316 O
stainless B-MATE
steel E-MATE
and O
CoCr B-MATE
alloys E-MATE
, O
etc O
. O


Many O
products O
are O
made O
from O
metals S-MATE
because O
of O
the O
needs O
for O
strength S-PRO
and O
accuracy S-CHAR
. O


In O
AM S-MANP
, O
part O
strength S-PRO
is O
often O
acceptable O
but O
part O
accuracy S-CHAR
is O
very O
often O
not O
. O


Metal S-MATE
parts O
are O
often O
mated O
with O
others O
and O
so O
the O
joining S-MANP
surfaces O
must O
align O
with O
each O
other O
. O


Most O
metal B-MANP
AM E-MANP
processes O
create O
parts O
with O
poor O
surface B-FEAT
finish E-FEAT
, O
usually O
no O
better O
than O
15 O
Rz O
and O
very O
often O
considerably O
worse O
. O


Machine S-MACEQ
finishing S-MANP
is O
therefore O
a O
common O
requirement O
as S-MATE
a O
post-process S-CONPRI
. O


Thermally O
induced O
distortion S-CONPRI
due O
to O
large O
temperature B-PARA
gradients E-PARA
during O
builds S-CHAR
and O
corresponding O
residual B-PRO
stresses E-PRO
is O
also O
a O
common O
phenomenon O
for O
metal B-MANP
AM E-MANP
. O


Features O
may O
therefore O
be S-MATE
imprecisely O
located O
and O
it O
may O
be S-MATE
better O
to O
provide O
a O
machining B-PARA
allowance E-PARA
in O
the O
initial O
AM B-MACEQ

. O


The O
introduction O
of O

that O
combine O
AM S-MANP
with O

that O
operate O
in O
a O
sequential O
manner O
aim O
to O
overcome O
issues O
around O

This O
is O
particularly O
useful O
where O

For O
much O
of O
the O
time O
that O
AM B-MANP
technology E-MANP
has O
been O
under O
development O
, O
post-processing S-CONPRI
has O
been O
something O
that O
you O
would O
rather O
not O
do O
and O
eliminate O
if O
possible O
. O


AM S-MANP
is O
now O
considered O
as S-MATE
something O
that O
can O
shorten O
process B-ENAT
chains E-ENAT
, O
not O
eliminate O
them O
entirely O
. O


Sometimes O
it O
may O
be S-MATE
appropriate O
to O
include O
a O
design S-FEAT
feature O
in O
the O
post-process S-CONPRI
rather O
than O
in O
the O
AM S-MANP
build O

. O


Post-processing S-CONPRI
tasks O
can O
be S-MATE
broadly O
divided O
in O
terms O
of O
those O
that O
can O
require O
significant O
manual O
intervention O
and O
those O
that O
can O
be S-MATE
carried O
out O
in O
a O
largely O
automated O
fashion S-CONPRI
. O


Of O
course O
this O
depends O
on O
the O
available O
technology S-CONPRI
to O
achieve O
these O
tasks O
as S-MATE
well O
as S-MATE
the O
level O
of O

, O

issues O
, O

of O

, O
etc O
. O


Post-processing S-CONPRI
can O
also O
be S-MATE
considered O
in O
terms O
of O
those O
that O
need O
to O
be S-MATE
carried O
out O
due O
to O
the O
characteristics O
of O
the O
AM B-MANP
process E-MANP
used O
and O
those O
that O
are O
more O
aimed O
at O
enhancement O
of O
the O
AM B-MACEQ
parts E-MACEQ
. O


Like O
with O
the O
previous O
classification S-CONPRI
, O
there O
are O
overlaps O
or O
grey O
areas S-PARA
, O
around O
where O
exactly O
surface B-FEAT

fits S-CONPRI
for O
example O
. O


This O
can O
also O
form O
part O
of O
the O
decision O
making O
in O
the O

The O
AM B-MANP

refer O
to O

and O
are O
aimed O
at O
providing O
a O
consistent O
quality S-CONPRI
of O
output O
suited O
to O
the O
general O
application O
. O


Many O
processes S-CONPRI
use O
support B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
which O
have O
to O
be S-MATE
removed O
somehow O
, O
often O
requiring O
further O
finishing S-MANP
of O
regions O
where O
the O
supports S-APPL
connected O
with O
the O
part O
. O


Build B-CONPRI
strategies E-CONPRI
often O
revolve O
around O
minimising O
the O
amount O
of O
supports S-APPL
or O
avoiding O
key O
surfaces S-CONPRI
for O
aesthetic S-CONPRI
or O
accuracy S-CHAR
reasons O
. O


For O
many O
machines S-MACEQ
, O
flat O
and O
curved B-CONPRI
surfaces E-CONPRI
can O
appear O
different O
due O
to O
the O
stair-stepping O
phenomena O
. O


Abrasive S-MATE
or O
chemical O
finishing S-MANP
can O
be S-MATE
used O
to O
make O
these O
surfaces S-CONPRI
appear O
more O
uniform O
. O


A O
further O
post-processing S-CONPRI
task O
can O
revolve O
around O
excess O
material S-MATE
that O
may O
be S-MATE
adhering O
to O
the O
part O
surfaces S-CONPRI
. O


This O
may O
be S-MATE
a O
surrounding O
material S-MATE
that O
protects O
these O
surfaces S-CONPRI
or O
they O
may O
be S-MATE
residual O
material S-MATE
due O
to O
inconsistencies O
in O
the O
process S-CONPRI
, O
similar O
to O

in O

operations O
. O


Although O
specific O

can O
also O
be S-MATE
application O

of O
the O

chosen O
to O

also O
be S-MATE

the O
form O
of O
a O
furnace S-MACEQ
cycle O
, O
perhaps O
using O
hot B-MANP
isostatic I-MANP

. O


Since O
some O
processes S-CONPRI
can O
be S-MATE
slightly O
heterogeneous S-CONPRI
in O
nature O
, O
accounting O
for O
shrinkage S-CONPRI
may O
require O
careful O
preparation O
and O
difficult O
to O
precisely O
control O
. O


Metal B-MANP

in O

are O
commonly O
used O
as S-MATE

. O


Choice O
of O
metal S-MATE
as S-MATE
a O
part O

often O
relates O
to O
part O

and O
while O

can O
represent O
a O
problem O
. O


Finish B-MANP

often O

, O
much O
in O
the O

way O
as S-MATE

would O
treat O
a O

In O
these O

It O
can O

argued O
that O

fewer O

: O

4.1 O
Topology B-FEAT
optimization E-FEAT
Topology S-CONPRI
optimization S-CONPRI
was O
originally O
used O
for O
mechanical S-APPL
design S-FEAT
problems O
to O
answer O
a O
layout S-CONPRI
optimization O
question O
: O
how O
to O
put O
the O
right O
material S-MATE
in O
the O
right O
place O
of O
a O
pre-defined O
design B-CONPRI
space E-CONPRI
? O
The O
objective O
was O
to O
obtain O
the O
expected O
mechanical B-CONPRI
properties E-CONPRI
at O
minimum O
material S-MATE

. O


The O
method O
uses O
numerical O

and O
design S-FEAT
solution O
update O
steps O
in O
an O
iterative O
way O
, O
mostly O
guided O
by O
gradient O
computation S-CONPRI
or O
non-gradient B-CONPRI
discrete I-CONPRI
approaches E-CONPRI
. O


Traditionally O
, O
TO O
is O
driven O
by O
an O
objective O
function O
, O
minimizing O
or O
maximizing O
while O
being O
subjected O
to O
a O
set S-APPL
of O
predefined O
constraints O
, O
such O
as S-MATE
mass O
, O

, O
vibration B-PARA
frequency E-PARA
, O
etc O
. O


Usually O
, O
continuous B-CONPRI
design I-CONPRI
variables E-CONPRI
are O
used O
to O
solve O
the O
TO O
problem O
in O
a O
discretized O
way O

During O
this O
optimization S-CONPRI
iteration O
process S-CONPRI
, O
segments O
of O
the O
predefined O
initial O
design B-CONPRI

are O

removed O
so O
as S-MATE

arrive O
at O
the O

Initial O
methods O
developed O
remove O
materials S-CONPRI
bit O
by O
bit O
using O
a O
strain S-PRO
energy O
distribution S-CONPRI
and O
a O
preset O

. O


More O
advanced O
methods O
use O
genetic B-CONPRI
algorithms E-CONPRI
that O
both O
add O
and O
remove O
materials S-CONPRI
. O


porous S-PRO
structures O
and O
lattice B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
, O
but O
with O
relaxed O
mathematical S-CONPRI
constraints O
. O


As S-MATE
stated O
in O
, O
even O
current O
pure O
TO O
studies O
still O
face S-CONPRI
problems O
, O
such O
as S-MATE
efficiency O
, O
general O
applicability O
, O
ease O
of O
use O
, O
etc O
. O


Many O
of O
them O
only O
use O
relatively O
simple S-MANP
boundary B-CONPRI
conditions E-CONPRI
with O
limited O
constraints O
, O
e.g O
. O


When O
introducing O
extra O
AM S-MANP
related O
constraints O
such O
as S-MATE
support O
structures/overhangs O
, O

, O
anisotropic B-PRO
material I-PRO
properties E-PRO
, O

, O

strain/stress O
into O
TO O
, O
this O
would O
result O
in O
more O
complex O
constraints O
or O
boundary B-CONPRI
conditions E-CONPRI
. O


This O
again O
would O
result O
in O
more O
difficulties O
for O
the O
TO O
process S-CONPRI
to O
find O
the O
solutionwith O
an O
effective O
and O
fast O
converging O
simulation S-ENAT
process S-CONPRI
. O


Attracted O
by O
the O
great O
potential O
of O
AM S-MANP
, O
researchers O
investigated O
TO O
with O
AM S-MANP
constraints O
, O
focussing O
on O
generating O
an O
optimal O
topologically B-CONPRI
lightweight E-CONPRI
material S-MATE
layout S-CONPRI
, O
to O
be S-MATE
printed O
without O
any O
manufacturing S-MANP
problems O
. O


Therefore O
, O
recent O
researches O
on O
TO O
for O
DfAM O
are O
geared O
towards O
print-ready O
designs S-FEAT
bridging S-CONPRI
challenges O
in O
design S-FEAT
and O
printing O
. O


One O
is O
to O
represent O
AM S-MANP
constraints O
with O
mathematical S-CONPRI
models O
and O
embed O
them O
into O
the O
TO O
iteration O
process S-CONPRI
. O


The O
other O
is O
to O
use O
TO O
to O
generate O
one O
or O
a O
set S-APPL
of O
finite O
reference O
design S-FEAT
solutions O
and O
apply O
design B-CONPRI
rules E-CONPRI
or O
experience O
to O
adapt O
these O
solutions O
manually O
or O
automatically O
to O
the O
AM S-MANP
constraints O
. O


This O
last O
category O
thus O
applies O
AM S-MANP
constraints O
in O
the O
post-processing S-CONPRI
stage O
of O
a O
given O
TO O
result O
. O


For O
ease O
of O
practice O
, O
most O
of O
the O
earliest O
works O
directly O
tried O
to O
use O
existing O
traditional O
TO O
, O
or O
other O
similar O
structure B-CONPRI
optimization E-CONPRI
methods O
, O
for O
lightweight S-CONPRI
design S-FEAT
in O
DfAM O
, O
without O
considering O
any O
AM S-MANP
constraints O
. O


The O
main O
reason O
for O
this O
was O
the O
assumption O
that O
AM S-MANP
can O
overcome O
manufacturing S-MANP
problems O
of O
TO O
generated O
structure S-CONPRI
as S-MATE
these O
structures O
would O
encounter O
in O
conventional B-MANP
manufacturing E-MANP
processes O
. O


Although O
the O
2D S-CONPRI
or O
3D S-CONPRI
TO O
produced O
structures O
could O
be S-MATE
printed O
by O
polymer S-MATE
AM B-MANP
processes E-MANP
, O
the O
direct O
application O
of O
the O
existing O
non-tailored O
TO O
may O
have O
difficulty O
using O
metallic B-MANP
AM E-MANP
. O


This O
is O
more O
complicated O
due O
to O
the O
multi-physical O
phenomena O
which O
can O
not O
be S-MATE
handled O
by O
relatively O
simple S-MANP
macro S-FEAT
mechanic O
and O
geometric O
based O
calculations O
. O


A O
large O
number O
of O
researchers O
began O
to O
associate O
specific O
AM S-MANP
constraints O
with O
their O
TO O
process S-CONPRI
, O
either O
as S-MATE
a O
TO O
process S-CONPRI
driver O
or O
a O
TO O
post-processor O
. O


However O
, O
their O
efforts O
are O
mainly O
focusing O
at O
2D S-CONPRI
problems O
with O
consideration O
of O
only O
one O
simple S-MANP
or O
limited O
subset O
of O
AM S-MANP
constraints O
, O
e.g O
. O


support S-APPL
volume O
or O
overhang B-PARA
area E-PARA
. O


For O
example O
Leary O
, O
describes O
a O
variant O
where O
traditional O
TO O
is O
conducted O
and O
a O
boundary B-CONPRI
decomposition I-CONPRI
algorithm E-CONPRI
is O
applied O
to O
detect O
and O
decompose O
the O
internal O
or O
external O
boundary S-FEAT
areas S-PARA
needing O
support B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
. O


Then O
, O
the O
detected O
and O
decomposed O
relatively O
large O
cavities O
are O
filled O
with O
a O
set S-APPL
of O
smaller O
generated O
boundaries S-FEAT
so O
as S-MATE
to O
avoid O
the O
appearance O
of O
overhang S-PARA
as S-MATE
shown O
in O
7 O
. O


In O
that O
example O
even O
though O
a O
sophisticated O
decomposition S-PRO
algorithm S-CONPRI
was O
designed S-FEAT
and O
the O
use O
of O
support B-FEAT
structure E-FEAT
in O
printing O
was O
mostly O
avoided O
, O
the O
result O
is O
still O
far O
from O
optimal O
. O


2D S-CONPRI
results O
sometimes O
are O
quite O
useless O
in O
practice O
since O
the O
broadened O
design B-CONPRI
freedom E-CONPRI
exists O
in O
3D S-CONPRI
, O
not O
2D S-CONPRI
. O


Taking O
the O
TO O
example O
in O
7 O
, O
we O
can O
easily O
rotate O
the O
2D S-CONPRI
result O
around O
the O
X-axis O
in O
the O
3D S-CONPRI
and O
then O
we O
will O
find O
that O
there O
is O
no O
need O
of O
support B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
. O


This O
means O
all O
the O
optimization S-CONPRI
steps O
are O
useless O
if O
we O
simply O
change O
the O
build B-PARA
orientation E-PARA
. O


The O
dilemma O
may O
be S-MATE
caused O
by O
two O
factors O
: O
the O
TO O
researcher O
has O
a O
lack O
of O
knowledge O
on O
the O
AM B-MANP
processes E-MANP
or O
the O
direct O
embedding O
of O
AM S-MANP
constraints O
with O
mathematical S-CONPRI
models O
in O
the O
2D S-CONPRI
or O
3D S-CONPRI
TO O

Recently O

with O
generative B-ENAT

, O
e.g. O
, O

Certainly O

common O
to O
TO O
and O
generative B-ENAT

methods O
and O
, O
as S-MATE
stated O
above O
, O
there O
are O
many O
difficulties O
. O


As S-MATE
a O
compromise O
, O
generative B-ENAT
design E-ENAT
can O
include O
human O
knowledge O
to O
interactively O
select O
the O
candidate O

so O
as S-MATE
to O
reduce O
the O

. O


Therefore O
, O
this O
is O
an O
indirect O
lightweight S-CONPRI
design S-FEAT
method O
for O
AM S-MANP
, O
which O
is O
also O
called O
lattice B-CONPRI
configuration E-CONPRI
, O
18 O
. O


To O
obtain O
lattice B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
, O
generally O
we O
have O
two O
approaches O
: O
1 O
. O


Homogenization S-MANP
and O
2 O
. O


Density S-PRO
based O
mapping O
. O


The O
former O
homogenizes O
the O
lattice B-FEAT
structure E-FEAT
as S-MATE
representative O
volume S-CONPRI
elements S-MATE
, O
like O
solid O
material S-MATE
. O


The O
lattice B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
are O
similar O
to O
the O
micro O
porous S-PRO
for O
the O
traditional O
solid O
structure S-CONPRI
in O
homogenized B-PRO
volumes E-PRO
. O


In O
this O
way O
, O
special O
properties S-CONPRI
should O
be S-MATE
assigned O
to O
the O
representative O
volumes O
and O
then O
we O
can O
apply O
traditional O
TO O
or O
other O
structure B-CONPRI
optimization E-CONPRI
methods O
to O
operate O
the O
special O
volumes O
. O


Representative O
researches O
that O
apply O
this O
method O
can O
be S-MATE
found O
in O
and O
19 O
illustrates O
the O
general O
workflow S-CONPRI
. O


The O
second O
approach O
maps O
the O
density S-PRO
values O
obtained O
from O
non-penalized O
TO O
results O
onto O
the O
explicit O
predefined O
lattice B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
with O
optional O
adaptation O
to O
improve O
the O
approximation O
accuracy S-CHAR
of O
mechanical B-CONPRI
response E-CONPRI
. O


Based O
on O
this O
approach O
, O
uniform O
or O
graded O
lattice B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
can O
be S-MATE
obtained O
. O


Example O
studies O
can O
be S-MATE
found O
in O
. O


20 O
shows O
an O
example O
where O
different O
predefined O
lattice B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
are O
used O
to O
map O
the O
solid O
volume S-CONPRI
TO O
contours S-FEAT
. O


Although O
the O
two O
appraoches O
are O
not O
hard O
to O
understand O
, O
the O
operation O
and O
optimization S-CONPRI
of O
lattice B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
is O
quite O
complicated O
, O
especially O
for O
large O
size O
structure B-FEAT
design E-FEAT
. O


The O
first O
problem O
is O
the O
representation/digitalization O
of O
lattice B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
. O


Usually O
, O
solid O
representation O
or O
surface S-CONPRI
representation O
can O
be S-MATE
used O
for O
individual O
lattice B-FEAT
units E-FEAT
. O


But O
when O
filled O
into O
solid B-MACEQ
hulls E-MACEQ
, O
the O
number O
of O
lattice B-FEAT
units E-FEAT
is O
very O
big O
, O
which O
makes O
the O
CAD B-MANS
file E-MANS
difficult O
to O
operate O
, O
including O
sweeping O
, O
meshing/mapping O
and O
tessellation S-FEAT
. O


Secondly O
, O
when O
doing O
numerical B-ENAT
simulation E-ENAT
, O
the O
computation S-CONPRI
cost O
is O
much O
higher O
since O
many O
more O
finite B-CONPRI
element E-CONPRI
units O
are O
required O
. O


Thirdly O
, O
when O
filling O
lattice B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
into O
solid B-MACEQ
hulls E-MACEQ
, O
one O
needs O
to O
use O
uniform O
lattice S-CONPRI
in O
trimming S-MANP
or O
non-uniform O
lattice S-CONPRI
with O
conformal O
interface S-CONPRI
, O
which O
depends O
on O
specific O
design S-FEAT
cases O
. O


Some O
researchers O
stated O
that O
conformal B-FEAT
lattice I-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
have O
better O
structural B-CHAR
performance E-CHAR
than O
that O
of O
uniformed O
. O


However O
, O
the O
operation O
of O
conformal B-FEAT
lattice E-FEAT
is O
more O
complicated O
and O
more O
difficult O
to O
control O
the O
manufacturability S-CONPRI
since O
they O
are O
not O
, O
like O
uniform O
lattices S-CONPRI
usually O
are O
, O
derived O
from O
benchmarking O
results O
. O


After O
that O
, O
the O
computation S-CONPRI
cost O
is O
a O
big O
issue O
, O
not O
only O
for O
the O
representation O
, O
but O
also O
for O
simulation S-ENAT
and O
manufacturing S-MANP
. O


That O
is O
why O
some O
researchers O
proposed O
to O
use O
kernel O
or O
symbolic O
representations O
for O
lattice B-FEAT
units E-FEAT
. O


Finally O
, O
the O
most O
important O
challenge O
is O
how O
to O
obtain O
the O
global O
optimum O
when O
using O
lattice B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
. O


The O
approximation O
process S-CONPRI
further O
reduces O
the O
original O
design B-CONPRI
space E-CONPRI
and O
introduces O
more O
errors S-CONPRI
. O


Predefined O
and O
benchmarked O
limited O
lattice B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
with O
fixed O
parameters S-CONPRI
are O
just O
a O
subset O
of O
the O
design S-FEAT
variants O
. O


Actually O
, O
even O
for O
predefined O
lattice B-FEAT
units E-FEAT
, O
there O
are O
more O
parameters S-CONPRI
that O
can O
be S-MATE
modified O
and O
adjusted O
to O
specific O
design S-FEAT
cases O
. O


Currently O
, O
many O
optimization S-CONPRI
studies O
for O
lattice B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
are O
only O
limited O
to O
density S-PRO
, O
represented O
by O
strut B-PARA
diameter E-PARA
, O
and O
very O
little O
work O
focuses O
on O
parameter S-CONPRI
optimization S-CONPRI
and O
computation S-CONPRI
benchmarking O
for O
large O
lattice B-FEAT
structure I-FEAT
design E-FEAT
cases O
. O


Therefore O
, O
to O
be S-MATE
practical O
, O
current O
methods O
and O
tools S-MACEQ
from O
academic O
codes O
or O
commercial O
software S-CONPRI
tools O
all O
adopt O
knowledge O
based O
methods O
with O
TO O
methods O
for O
lattice B-FEAT
filling E-FEAT
. O


Usually O
, O
a O
lattice S-CONPRI
library O
is O
built O
to O
store O
predefined O
lattice B-FEAT
units E-FEAT
, O
benchmarked O
with O
numerical B-ENAT

or O
manufacturability S-CONPRI

, O
and O
then O
a O
limited O
set S-APPL
of O
control O
options O
, O
concerning O
the O
lattice B-FEAT

, O

, O
layout S-CONPRI
orientation O
, O
etc. O
, O
are O
available O
for O
the O
filling O
operation O
. O


This O
is O
the O
main O
workflow S-CONPRI
of O
current O
tools S-MACEQ
. O


As S-MATE
said O
before O
, O
although O
relatively O
small O
or O
medium O
sized O
lattice B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
can O
be S-MATE
obtained O
, O
one O
not O
only O
sacrifices O
the O
stiffness S-PRO
but O
also O
it O
may O
be S-MATE
more O
difficult O
to O
search O
for O
the O
original O
global O
optimal O
lightweight S-CONPRI
design S-FEAT
solution O
. O


If O
one O
only O
considers O
the O
lightweight S-CONPRI
effect O
in O
the O
design S-FEAT
, O
lattice B-FEAT
filling E-FEAT
may O
not O
be S-MATE
the O
optimal O
choice O
. O


However O
, O
lattice B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
can O
bring O
other O
benefits O
, O
e.g O
. O


energy B-CHAR
absorption E-CHAR
and O
heat B-CONPRI
conduction E-CONPRI
that O
solid O
structures O
may O
not O
have O
. O


This O
would O
be S-MATE
an O
important O
factor O
to O
encourage O
research S-CONPRI
and O
practice O
in O
the O
lattice B-CONPRI
domain E-CONPRI
. O


5 O
Tools S-MACEQ
and O
methods O
for O
optimizing O
surface B-FEAT
structure E-FEAT
As S-MATE
discussed O
above O
, O
the O
global O
optimal O
for O
structure B-FEAT
design E-FEAT
is O
usually O
hard O
to O
obtain O
. O


Similar O
to O
lattice B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
, O
which O
are O
made O
artificially O
, O
natural O
porous S-PRO
structures O
become O
a O
set S-APPL
of O
special O
elements S-MATE
to O
deal O
with O

requirements O
. O


Examples O
include O
among O
others O
lightweight S-CONPRI

absorbers O
, O
micro-reactors S-MACEQ
, O
heat B-MACEQ

, O
or O
self-adaptating O
structures O
. O


These O
structures/functionalities O
have O
been O
known O
for O
some O
time O
, O
but O
due O
to O
the O
ability O
of O
AM S-MANP
to O
produce O
these O
complex B-CONPRI
structures E-CONPRI
, O
they O
now O
become O
part O
of O
the O
solution S-CONPRI
principles O
that O
can O
be S-MATE
applied O
by O
the O

. O


Hence O
, O
the O
mimicking O
and O
post-processing S-CONPRI
of O
natural O
inspired O
or O
randomly O
generated O
complex O
topologies S-CONPRI
become O
a O

practice O
, O
which O
is O
called O
bio-inspired S-CONPRI
or O
biomimetic B-FEAT

. O


Its O
goal O
is O
to O
generate O
either O
lightweight B-MACEQ

with O
unexpected O
mechanical B-CONPRI
properties E-CONPRI
, O
similar O

in O

, O
or O
multi-functional O

This O
type O
of O

is O
more O
difficult O
than O
that O
of O
relatively O
regular O
or O
conformal O
periodic O
lattice B-FEAT

. O


Hence O
, O
the O
design S-FEAT
and O
simulation S-ENAT
focuses O
more O
on O
the O
form O
and O
shape O
of O
the O
surfaces S-CONPRI
while O
the O

are O
hard O

Nevertheless , the main outcome of the reported experience is the proposed redesign approach for part consolidation using metal AM . 
The proposed approach is general , well structured , and detailed enough to be immedialtely applicable at industrial level , but it needs further testing on different case studies to prove the benefits . 
An interesting framework to part consolidation and functional integration exploiting AM technologies is presented and validated in . 
In a further development of their approach , the authors have recently addressed the relevant problem of detecting the possible candidates for part consolidation , as reported in . 
Potentially , when dealing with part consolidation , the designer may consider the need of part decomposition . 
The need to increase the number of parts in a product fabricated by AM may be due to many reasons : printability , productivity , functionality , artistry , and interchangeability . 
Printability is actually the main reason being related to the limited working envelope of AM machines . 
In the part decomposition problem in AM is addressed , but it is the first and unique example of research on this topic . 
9 Conclusion and future challenges DfAM is about design for the whole AM product life cycle . 
This paper has presented a framework of tools and methods for DfAM and has shown the strong interaction between these life cycle stages and AM product design . 
The state of the art was presented on many of these design tools and their applicability was illustrated using many of the latest examples from research and industry . 
9.1 AM suitability exploration A growing number of companies are exploring the commercial use of AM within their supply chain . 
For that , better methods and tools are needed to help the designer obtain an overview that identifies the match between functional and economical demands of the intended product and all stages of AM in product development . 
Methods for early cost estimation are lacking , while current figures for production cost per cm3 are not based on established calculation methods and lack experimental and industrial verification . 
Late life cycle stages of postprocessing , inspection and certification have a significant impact on production cost and general applicability of AM , but these stages are underrepresented in current DfAM approaches . 
Finally , more education on Additive Manufacturing is needed , as the majority of product designers and engineers are still trained to think subtractive . 
9.2 Product design for AM goals Topology optimization enables strategies that go beyond lightweight design to include minimizing support usage and thermal deformation , optimizing local heat input , and with that the local material properties , porosity and strength . 
TO methods need further enhancement to tackle optimization as a 3D problem while taking all later product development stages into account . 
Generative design strategies have the benefit that they generate many possible design solutions , but as is the case with TO , few production and inspection constraints are currently integrated . 
Lattice structures show explicit benefits , especially in application fields involving energy absorption and heat conduction . 
They are however computationally intensive , which limits the optimization possibilities for large lattices to a limited set of parameters . 
When looking at the part interior , specially designed porosity is seen as a promising new feature for internal transport of gasses and fluids . 
Both the optimal process settings as well as models for their application need further research to be applicable in everyday product design . 
To fully exploit the benefits of functional material complexity , further research must be conducted on rules and CAD representations of FGM related design intent . 
However , the development of design tools and methods is still a matter of basic research and far from industrial application . 
The future of additive manufacturing is also looking towards 4D applications where those challenges will be even more relevant . 
For the final optimization of geometry so that it combines AM benefits with efficient production and inspection , a lot of research has been conducted . 
At an individual process level design knowledge is available and constantly being extended or refined . 
Further research is needed to enable improved integration in upstream product design steps like TO and generative design . 
Integrating processing and manufacturing with design in AM is feasible since the full digital chain is there . 
In current AM practice only a few zones in a product are defined where process settings can be defined , for example for the top and bottom facing surfaces and the bulk of the product in L-PBF . 
If machine learning and closed loop control can be used to define the optimal settings for each deposition area , the need for support structures as well as the effects of thermal stresses and deformations are expected to reduce/diminish . 
This will have large impact on the AM products and the way they are designed . 
A combination of computational and knowledge-based methods would be an optimal solution for DfAM in the future to define qualified AM design solutions . 
Data analytic methods could be used to explore and discover knowledge from existing validated designs or dig out implicit knowledge from large industrial practice and experimental data sets . 
A collaborative cloud-based DfAM platform would be more sustainable for the world if people could share their designs and design knowledge as well as other AM processing related data sets . 
This would enable and advance wide KBE in DfAM , save a lot of cost and time and improve quality over the trial and error practice in current DfAM . 
This will result in new application areas , new process constraints and new AM features The main goal of this review is to provide a detailed and comprehensive description of the published work from the past decade regarding AM of ceramic materials with possible applications in dentistry . 
The main printable materials and most common technologies are also addressed , underlining their advantages and main drawbacks . 
Methods Online databases were consulted on this topic . 
Results Ceramic materials are broadly used in dentistry to restore/replace damaged or missing teeth , due to their biocompatibility , chemical stability and mechanical and aesthetic properties . 
Due to their brittleness nature , a very tight control of the manufacturing process is needed to obtain dental pieces with adequate mechanical properties . 
Additive manufacturing is an emerging technology that constitutes an interesting and viable manufacturing alternative to the conventional subtractive methods . 
AM enables the production of customized complex 3D parts in a more sustainable and less expensive way . 
AM of ceramics can be achieved with an extensive variety of methods . 
Although very promising , AM of ceramic dental materials remains understudied and further work is required to make it a widespread technology in dentistry . 
In dentistry , as in many other fields , the production of dental pieces is increasingly becoming automated . 
Computer aided design and/or computer aided manufacturing have become progressively widespread within the medical and dental fields . 
These tools are generally used in the manufacture of dental pieces in machining centers , where extra material is removed from a block to obtain the piece with the desired shape . 
This technique is known as subtractive manufacturing . 
Nowadays , a new type of technology is emerging , additive manufacturing , also referred to as 3D printing , that allow building up pieces by adding materials layer-by-layer , based on a computerized 3D model . 
This type of technology has suffered great developments in a wide range of areas , allowing to produce pieces of all classes of materials , including materials of biological origin . 
AM focus has been moving from prototype fabrication to rapid manufacturing of small or medium quantities of end-use products . 
Among the main areas of AM application stands out : - Aerospace : AM technology is particularly suitable to obtain a limited number of pieces that are usually required for aerospace applications , with complex geometries and made of advanced materials which are difficult , costly and time-consuming to manufacture . 
- Automotive : AM technology is an important tool in this industry , since it can reduce the development cycle , manufacturing and product costs of automotive components . 
It allows producing small quantities of structural and functional parts and thus , is particularly interesting for racing vehicles , where light-weight alloys and composites are used to obtain highly complex structures . 
- Energy : AM technology allows the fast development and fabrication of prototypes to reduce the cost and lead-time of research and development of new solutions that reduce the fossil energy dependency . 
It increases the design possibilities to improve energy efficiency and/or power density , in alternatives that use renewable and clean energies . 
- Biomedical : Recent developments in the biomaterials field , biologic sciences and biomedicine have potentiated the use of AM techniques . 
Customization is a critical factor in this area and AM allows the production of a wide range of products with specific properties and shapes that meet the patient needs . 
For example , it is possible to produce diagnostic platforms , orthopedic and dental implants , drug delivery systems , medical devices , tissue scaffolds and artificial organs . 
Biofabrication through AM emerged in the recent years as a new alternative to fabricate tissues . 
Here , living cells are deposited layer-by-layer in combination with different biomaterials to obtain complex living structures . 
In the dentistry field , the use of AM to produce endurable dental structures is expected to bring advantages over conventional manufacturing methods , as reported on other fields . 
In particular , it shall : - Allow the production of customized near-net-shape dental pieces with intricate details . 
Product complexity shall not add cost to production beyond the design stage , because once the design is set , costs are independent of the shape . 
- Allow reduction of dental parts production time and consequently of time-to-market . 
Traditional subtractive technologies involve several time-consuming steps , while AM allows a faster direct production starting simply from a 3D scan of the oral cavity . 
- Limit human error relevance in the procedures . 
Minor human intervention is required in AM due to the lower number of manufacturing steps . 
- Decrease the environmental impact , ensuring a higher manufacturing sustainability . 
Being an additive technique , it reduces material waste and energy consumption and eliminates the use of conventional manufacturing tools . 
Globally , AM allows moving from mass production to mass customization , with significant efficiency increase and production costs decrease . 
The expected dissemination of this technology applied to dental prosthesis shall result in equipmentcost decrease . 
Thus , the reduction of final product price is predictable , increasing the accessibility of dental care to the poorest sectors of the population . 
Due to the recent expiration of the main 3D printing patents , the access to printers became easier and less expensive . 
Digital dentistry is reported to be one of the fastest growing sectors of the AM technologies . 
There are several possible applications of AM techniques in dentistry , e.g . 
crowns , bridges , dentures , models , surgical guides , implants and orthodontics materials . 
Several challenges emerge when this technique is considered to produce endurable dental devices . 
For example , the reliability of the process , surface finishing of the samples and materials density are among the major concerns . 
Concerning dental materials that can be used in AM , polymers are the most studied and used ones , followed by metals . 
AM of ceramic dental materials is still underdeveloped , mainly due to the difficulties to produce pieces with suitable surface finishing , mechanical properties and dimensional accuracy . 
The available literature regarding AM of ceramic materials represents less than 5 % of the total AM published related work . 
The studies are even fewer in what concerns ceramic materials for dental applications . 
This paper presents a recent overview of published work concerning AM of ceramic materials for dental applications . 
A summary of potentially printable dental biomaterials and brief descriptions of the most common digital manufacturing technologies are also provided , highlighting the main features , advantages and drawbacks , to better understand the potential and restrictions of each technology . 
The used keywords strings were : 3D printing AND Dental ; Additive manufacturing AND Dental . 
Additive manufacturing of bioceramics for dental applicationsbut included in the remaining sections to complement this review and provide any additional remarks . 
3 Ceramic dental materials Bioceramics are broadly used in the dental field . 
These materials have some attractive features/attributes which are similar to natural dentition properties , e.g . 
compressive strength , thermal conductivity , radiopacity , colour stability , aesthetics . 
However , these materials are brittle , hard and sometimes difficult to process . 
Bioceramics can be divided in 4 categories , depending on their main system composition : glass-based systems ; glass-based systems with fillers , usually crystalline ; crystalline-based systems with glass fillers ; polycrystalline solids . 
Glass-based systems consist of materials that are made mostly of silicon dioxide and can comprise different amounts of alumina . 
Feldspars are composed of aluminosilicates , found in nature , containing different quantities of potassium and sodium . 
Feldspars can be modified in several ways in order to produce the glass used in the dental area . 
Additionally , synthetic forms of alumina silicate glasses may as well be manufactured for dental ceramics . 
The glass composition is almost the same as the pure glass category , being that the difference resides in the amount of different types of crystals that can either be added or grown in the glassy matrix . 
Nowadays , the primary crystal types are leucite , lithium dissilicate or fluoroapatite . 
Intended as an alternative to traditional metal ceramics , crystalline-based systems with glass fillers were developed . 
They are composed of glass-infiltrated , partially sintered alumina . 
Polycrystaline solids are made by directly sintering crystals together , forming a dense , air-free , glass-free , polycrystalline structure . 
In the next sections , a brief description is presented regarding the main properties of the most frequently used bioceramics in dental applications . 
3.1 Zirconia Zirconia ceramics were introduced in dentistry in the early nineties , as endosseous implants in dental prosthetic surgery . 
This material is known to have exceptional mechanical properties and ease of machining in the pre-sintering stage through CAD/CAM . 
Zirconia is biocompatible with the tissues in the oral cavity and has been reported to be osteoconductive , which means that this ceramic facilitates bone formation when in contact with it . 
Regarding mechanical properties , zirconia ceramics are considered to have high strength , hardness , wear resistance , resistance to corrosion , modulus of elasticity similar to steel , coefficient of thermal expansion similar to iron , and the highest fracture toughness among the most used ceramics . 
Zirconia-based ceramics can be stabilized in tetragonal or cubic phases depending on the used dopant , its concentration and temperature during the thermal treatments . 
For dental applications , zirconia is commonly stabilized with 3 mol % yttria . 
The excellent mechanical properties of stabilized tetragonal zirconia are related with the stress-induced from tetragonal to monoclinical transformation , which is accompanied by a 4.5 % volume increase . 
This behaviour leads to the development of compression zone , shielding the propagating crack tip which inhibits further crack propagation , successfully enhancing toughness . 
Nevertheless , there are some disadvantageous aspects of zirconia ceramics . 
3.2 Alumina Alumina , also called aluminum oxide , was first introduced in the 1970s . 
However , the initial applications presented a fracture rate of the order of 13 % . 
This observed failure was related to a higher porosity . 
With further developments , a decade later , a second improved generation of alumina ceramics was presented , characterized by higher density and smaller grains . 
This led to a decrease of the fracture rate to less than 5 % . 
Nowadays , there is available a third generation of alumina ceramic components , with properties such as high purity , high density and finer microstructure . 
Alumina is used in dental applications for fabrication of endodontic posts , orthodontic brackets , dental implants , crowns and bridges and in ceramic abutments . 
High purity alumina has usually a purity of 99.99 % and has been developed as an alternative to surgical metal alloys for dental applications . 
According to US Food and Drug Administration , only the high-purity Al2O3 can be used for medical grade ceramics . 
Impurities such as SiO2 , metal silicates and alkali metal oxides that form glassy grain boundary phases must be minimized to less than 0.1 wt % , since the in vivo degradation of such glassy phases leads to the appearance of stress concentration sites where cracks can be initiated , leading to the catastrophic failure of the component . 
It is possible to enhance alumina toughness and fracture strength by controlling the grain size and the porosity . 
This can be achieved using adequate sintering cycles , and adding some additives , zirconium oxide and chromium oxide ) . 
3.3 Leucite Leucite is a potassium alumina-silicate . 
This material displays a tetragonal structure at room temperature . 
At 625 it suffers a displacive phase transformation from tetragonal to cubic , together with a volume expansion of 1.2 % . 
Leucite has been widely used as a constituent of dental ceramics to modify the coefficient of thermal expansion , which is very important when the ceramic is to be fused or baked onto metal . 
Usually leucite-based materials are used for veneering ceramics in metal-ceramic restorations , also referred to as feldspathic porcelains . 
Leucite is attained by incongruent melting of feldspar at temperatures between 1150 and 1530 . 
Despite the mechanical properties of feldspathic porcelains being the weakest within ceramic dental materials , their global performance is perceived as quite successful . 
3.4 Lithium dissilicate Lithium silicate-based glass-ceramics were recently introduced as machinable materials to respond to the demanded increased strength , toughness and wear resistance , required for the fabrication of dental pieces . 
This ceramic material is used in the fabrication of single and multiunit dental restorations , mainly dental crowns , bridges , and veneers , due to its excellent mechanical and optical properties . 
In general , lithium disilicate presents a microstructure constituted by interlocking needle-like crystals embedded in a glass matrix . 
As a result of this morphology , cracks are forced to propagate around each individual lithium disilicate crystal . 
This type of microstructure increases both strength and toughness relatively to other commonly used glass-ceramics : they have a strength twice as higher as that of the first generation of leucite-reinforced ceramics . 
3.5 Mica Mica minerals are a group of sheet silicate minerals , or layer type silicates , that consist of varying complex formulae of Si , K , Na , Ca , F , O , Fe and Al . 
The mechanical properties are dictated by the specific crystal structure formed by the cleavage planes situated along the layers . 
Crack propagation is more likely to occur along the cleavage planes . 
Mica-based glass-ceramics are relevant for dental materials due to their good machinability , high strength and resistivity to thermal expansion as well as biocompatibility . 
3.6 Others ceramic dental materials Besides the examples mentioned above , there are other ceramic materials used in the dentistry field . 
For over 30 years , calcium phosphate-based formulations are recognized by their good osteoconductivity and biocompatibility in reconstructive surgeries . 
Tricalcium phosphate presents three polymorphs . 
These include : monoclinic , and hexagonal and rhombohedral form . 
Hydroxyapatite 62 ) is the main component of enamel , and is responsible for the bright white appearance and elimination of the diffuse reflectivity of light by closing the small pores of the enamel surface . 
HA can be used as filler in the repair of craniofacial defects or small holes and depressions on enamel surface , as grafting material and as coating in implant dentistry . 
Bioactive glasses are silicate-based materials that can form a strong chemical bond with the tissues . 
They present great interest in regeneration and healing of bone tissue . 
Their ability to support osteoblast cells , to bond to both soft and hard tissue and their capability of stimulating angiogenesis in the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor make them an attractive alternative relatively to other scaffold materials . 
Finally , dental impression materials still play a significant role in dentistry . 
Gypsum products are among the most frequently used materials by dental professionals , since its properties are easily modified by physical and chemical means . 
Gypsum may be used as impression material , mold material for processing complete dentures , as binders for silica in gold alloy casting investment , soldering investment , and investment for low-melting-point nickel-chromium alloys . 
3.7 Composites A composite material is defined as a combination of two or more materials . 
The resulting combination renders unique properties with characteristics different from the individual components . 
In dentistry , ceramic composites may comprise combinations such as ceramic-metal , ceramic-polymer , or ceramic-ceramic Examples of current dental ceramic-ceramic composites include aluminacomposites , commercially available as structural ceramics for dental devices . 
These materials , contain either alumina-toughened zirconia or zirconia-toughened alumina , depending on the percentage of the main component . 
These composites combine the transformation toughening capabilities of zirconia along with the lower susceptibility to low temperature degradation in biological fluids . 
More recently , with the development of nanotechnology , the bionanocomposites have emerged . 
These materials are expected to mimic native tissue structure , withstand high biting force and harsh oral cavity environment , e.g . 
sudden change of temperature or osmotic pressure and invasion of various pathogens . 
Possible applications for bionanocomposites in the dental field include dental tissue regeneration or its substitution . 
4 Digital manufacturing CAD/CAM production of fixed prosthetic restorations such as inlays , onlays , veneers , crowns , and fixed partial dentures is a relatively well established technology used by dental health professionals for over 20 years . 
All CAD/CAM systems involve three steps . 
The first one corresponds to the data acquisition , through various scanning technologies that allow to transform the site/product geometry into digital data to be processed by the computer . 
This is followed by manipulation and processing of the data set using a CAD software . 
Finally , the processed data are used for manufacturing of structures in the desired material through CAM . 
In dentistry , there are three different production concepts available , depending on the location of the steps of the CAD/CAM processes : - chairside production , - laboratory production , - centralized fabrication in a production center . 
The production can be carried out through several different technologies , that can be divided into two manufacturing processes : subtractive and additive manufacturing . 
4.1 Subtractive manufacturing There are several subtractive manufacturing techniques . 
The most used in dental ceramics processing is based on milling of pre-sintered or fully sintered blocks , through a computer numeric controlled machine . 
The CAM software automatically translates the CAD model into tool path for the CNC machine . 
This involves computation of the commands series that dictate the CNC milling , including sequencing , milling tools , and tool motion direction and magnitude . 
The accuracy of tool positioning has been reported to be within 10 . 
The 3-axis milling systems are the most commonly used in dental milling systems . 
In such systems , the milling burs move in three axes according to a defined path . 
SM is extensively used in dentistry for the production of dental pieces such as crowns and bridges . 
SM technology allows the processing of materials , which would otherwise be difficult to manipulate . 
This way , the exhaustive artisanal production techniques are decreased or even eliminated , thus allowing the dental technician to enhance the creative component of his manual manufacturing process . 
SM is a well-established technology which has the advantage of using intrinsically homogeneous materials which are unaffected by operating conditions . 
Furthermore , it requires low post-processing and the costs regarding the involved equipment are relatively reduced . 
However , this is a wasteful process because the piece is milled from an intact block with a significant loss of material amount . 
Factors such as the objectscomplexity , the dimension of the tooling equipment and the properties of the material can affect and limit the accuracy of this process . 
4.2 Additive manufacturing Additive manufacturing , also referred to as solid freeform fabrication , rapid prototyping or 3D printing , involves processing methodologies that are capable of producing structures by depositing materials layer-by-layer resorting to a computer generated design file . 
The workpiece is virtually sliced into several two-dimensional layers . 
Then , an AM machine generates the tool-path along the x and y directions . 
Each material layer is deposited one on top of the other , consecutively , forming a three-dimensional part . 
Ceramics present a higher melting point , higher susceptibility to thermal shook and lower sintrerability than the other group of materials . 
Thus , it is quite difficult to obtained fully consolidated parts , without defects , using AM methods that produced directly sintered bodies . 
In most of the cases , AM is used to obtain preliminary 3D structures in green that are built from mixture powders with organic or inorganic binder materials and need to be submitted to further steps of debinding and sintering . 
Some authors refer to these methods as indirect , contrarily to direct methods where the ceramic powder is sintered during the manufacturing procedure . 
The debinding step depends on the organic components and became diffusion limited by increasing the thickness of the part , leading to higher debinding times The debinding temperature need to be carefully chosen . 
If is to high the removal rate of the volatile products resulting from the binder decomposition is too high , the pressure may increase and lead to crack formation and/or delamination . 
A possible solution to overcome the internal stresses generated during debinding may be the use of plasticizing agents . 
The defects can also be avoided through the introduction of open spaces in the structure . 
That can be achieved by adding compounds able to evaporate/decompose at lower temperature than the debinding process temperature 2 . 
There are several applications for AM in dentistry . 
One of the earliest is medical modelling , for surgery guide , where anatomical modelsare created . 
The models can also be used as supports for the fabrication of restorations , for example , to help in the addition of veneered materials . 
In digital orthodontics , there are systems available that digitally realign the patientteeth to make a series of 3D printed models for the manufacture of aligners . 
3D printing technology can also be used to produce novel titanium dental implants with a porous or rough surface and different types of restorations/components in metallic or polymeric materials . 
In the next sections , the main AM technologies available , referred in 1 , are described , namely indirect methods , such as binder jetting , material extrusion and jetting and Vat polymerization/stereolitography , and direct methods , which include direct energy deposition and powder bed fusion . 
4.2.1 Binder jetting Binder jetting uses two materials , a powder-based material and a binder . 
Usually in the liquid form , the organic binder acts as an adhesive between ceramic powder particles . 
A print head deposits alternated layers of the building material and the binding material , moving horizontally along the x and y axes of the machine . 
After each layer , the build platform is lowered and the process repeated over the previous layer . 
BJ presents several advantages , such as the ability to use a range of materials as well as a large number of combinations powder/binder , being generally a fast printing process . 
The drawbacks of this technology are mainly related to the high porosity and consequent low mechanical properties of the printed pieces . 
This is due to factors such as the high friction within the powder particles , their random agglomeration and the absence of an external force to compress the powder and improve packaging . 
The flowability and spreadability of powders are especially important for BJ . 
Using powders with large particle sizes can enhance the flowability , however it may jeopardize the sinterability and densification behaviour after printing . 
Contrarily , very fine particle size may lead to considerable agglomeration and reduced flowability . 
Since after sintering , the pieces density rarely exceeds 50 % of the theoretical value , this technology seems not to be suitable for structural parts . 
In order to overcome this issue , the printed piece may be infiltered under vacuum with a glass material that penetrates in the pores by capillary effect . 
4.2.2 Material extrusion and jetting Generally , in the material extrusion process the material is heated and extruded through a nozzle . 
The nozzle can move horizontally , and the build platform can move vertically to enable the addition of each subsequent layer . 
This process , also known as fused deposition modeling , is the most widespread and inexpensive process within 3D printing technology . 
However , there are some drawbacks such as not being as fast as other AM processes and presenting an accuracy limited by the nozzle radius , which reduces the final product quality . 
In order to increase the final quality it is necessary to control factors such as extrusion speed and ensure constant pressure and flow . 
Another form of AM using material extrusion is material jetting process , where the material is deposited in the form of droplets , instead of filament , to form a 2D pattern . 
The printed layer is cured using ultraviolet radiation , immediately after the deposition . 
The process is repeated until the complete 3D part is formed . 
5 shows an example of an occlusal surface of a dental crown produced by this technique from a ceramic suspension of yttria partially stabilized zirconia . 
It is possible to observe surface waviness associated with layer-by-layer deposition . 
Material extrusion techniques also include robocasting . 
In this process , a filament of a paste is extruded through a nozzle while it moves over a platform , building the object layer-by-layer . 
The paste exits the nozzle with a given shape , without being necessary waiting for its solidification or drying to build the next layer . 
Freeze-form Extrusion Fabrication is another example of extrusion-based AM technology . 
Contrarily to most of the other extrusion freeform fabrication methods , in FEF , the organic binder content is only 2vol % and the solids loading of the paste can be higher than 50 vol % . 
During FEF the piece is built by keeping the surrounding environment of the building platform below the freezing temperature of water . 
This solidifies the paste after the deposition on each layer during the fabrication process . 
FEF enables the production of relatively large parts , when compared with traditional robocasting . 
In extrusion techniques , the mechanical properties can be improved by controlling the crystallographic texture of the materials . 
This may be achieved by mixing a small number of large particles of anisotropic shape with fine particles . 
During extrusion , the anisotropic particles align in the shear direction . 
In a later sintering step , the aligned particles grow absorbing the fine particles , leading to highly textured and dense ceramics . 
4.2.3 Vat polymerization/stereolitography Vat polymerization/stereolitography was created by Chuck Hull in 1986 and was the AM technology pioneer . 
SLA was the first AM to be applied in medicine , which was used to produce surgical models for alloplastic implant surgery in 1994 . 
In vat polymerization printing , a specific type of light is used to build parts one layer at a time , in a vat containing light-cured photopolymer resin mixed with ceramic powder . 
The light travels each layer through the surface of the liquid resin . 
Then , the building platform descends allowing that another layer of resin spreads over the surface , and thus repeating the process . 
This technology enables a rapid fabrication and allows to create complex shapes with high level of accuracy and good finish . 
The curing depth is a critical parameter that determines the accuracy of the formability . 
6 shows a zirconia implant printed trough this method . 
When compared to conventional polymer-based SLA , using ceramics can affect the line width and the curing depth . 
Also , since conventional SLA equipment uses dispersions with viscosities lower than 5 Pa.s , the particle size and the solids volume fraction of the ceramics preparations must be adjusted to meet the requirements of both formability and sinterability . 
To obtain ceramics with a high density , it is essential a fine particle size and a high solids volume fraction . 
Overall , SLA presents excellent surface finishing , but is still considered to be relatively expensive and present a lengthily post-processing time for unprocessed resin removal and additional curing . 
For ceramics , a final thermal cycle allows to remove the organic resin and sintering the material , increasing its density . 
4.2.4 Direct energy deposition techniques Direct energy deposition is a more complex additive printing process , commonly used to repair or add additional material to existing components . 
A typical DED machine consists of a nozzle mounted on a multi axis arm , which deposits melted material onto the specified surface , where it solidifies . 
The material is heated and melted using a laser , electron beam or plasma arc . 
The piece is lowered by a distance equivalent to the layer thickness . 
Although this process typically uses metal , it can also use polymers and ceramics , either provided in wire or powder form . 
For ceramic materials , it allows achieving almost 100 % density and avoids shrinkage or distortion , eliminating the need of debinding or sintering steps . 
Wilkes and Wissenbach were pioneer in studying the applicability of this method to manufacture ceramic components for medical applications . 
4.2.5 Powder bed fusion Powder-based printing technologies include selective laser sintering , direct metal laser sintering , selective laser melting and electron beam melting . 
All these technologies use heat to fuse the powdered materials . 
The differences rely on the energy source and powder materials . 
For instance , SLS , DMLS , and SLM all use lasers , while EBM uses electron beam as energy source In the sintering processes , the powders are not completely melted . 
This leads to porous internal structures and rough surfaces . 
In the melting processes , the powders are well fused , creating parts with enhanced mechanical properties and higher densities . 
The process begins with the spreading of a layer of material over the build platform , typically 0.1 mm thick . 
The energy source fuses the first layer or first cross section of the model . 
The build platform is then lowered and a new layer of powder is spread across the previous using a roller . 
7 shows a dental piece made of alumina-zirconia composite obtained by this process . 
The manufacturing time for powder bed fusion based techniques is lower than for other AM techniques . 
In fact , as it happens with direct energy deposition , since these techniques do not involve the use of binders for the production of intermediate green pieces , it is not required any debinding process . 
However , due to the high heating and cooling rates , thermal shock may occur , which may lead to cracking . 
This may be avoided by pre-heating the powder . 
5 Additive manufacturing of bioceramics for dental applications Ceramic materials where only recently considered in AM processing due to their intrinsic properties . 
The high melting points of ceramics make them difficult to melt under normal heating methods . 
Although it is possible to melt some ceramics , this process can cause new phase formation . 
On the other hand , several factors associated to the processing of the ceramic materials and to the characteristics of the raw materials used may affect the porosity of the final piece . 
An increase of porosity impairs the mechanical properties of the final product . 
However , it can be favourable for cellular growth or implant fixation , required for specific applications . 
This section will report published work where different bioceramics , such as zirconia , alumina , calcium phosphates and ceramic composites , with possible applications in dentistry , are processed using various AM technologies . 
5.1 Additive manufacturing of zirconia The information concerning the AM of zirconia-based compositions , with possible applications in dentistry is present in 2 . 
Ebert demonstrated the possibility to build dense three-dimensional components of the size of a crown , with its characteristic occlusal surface topography , through material extrusion technology , using zirconia ceramic suspensions . 
The printed and sintered samples were not completely free of process-related defects , mainly due to clogged nozzles during printing . 
However , it was possible to obtain specimens with relative density of 96.9 % , with mechanical properties comparable to those of conventionally produced 3Y-TZP via cold isostatic pressing . 
Moin , established that it is feasible to use high-end digital light processing technology to fabricate a root analogue implant with a certain amount of precision . 
However , the results showed a printed RAI with a 6.67 % larger surface area . 
A large number of factors are recognized to influence the precision of this printing technique , namely the resolution of the digital mirroring device and the composition of the ceramic/ photopolymer mixture . 
The authors claim that the precise control over spatially grade composition , microstructure design/distribution and shape are potential advantages over milling of unsintered ceramics . 
Osman also used a SLA method to efficiently print customized zirconia dental implants with sufficient dimensional accuracy . 
The study evaluated among other aspects , the dimensional accuracy , surface topography and mechanical properties . 
The authors report that the dimensional accuracy of the printed implant was high and the achieved mechanical properties showed flexural strength close to those of conventionally produced ceramics . 
SLA was again used by Xing , to produce ZrO2 complex shaped ceramic components with high dimensional accuracy and proper properties . 
The surface roughness of the unpolished ZrO2 showed an anisotropic behavior with values ranging from 0.41 to 1.07 on the measuring direction . 
This phenomenon could be eliminated through polishing , reducing Ra to a nanometer scale . 
The sintered ceramics had isotropic mechanical properties close to milled zirconia due to the homogeneity of the grain size . 
In the work of Scheithauer , the droplet formation behavior of zirconia suspensions for thermoplastic 3D printing was investigated . 
The precise deposition of small adjacent droplets of molten thermoplastic suspensions containing ceramic particles allowed to obtain filament-like structures by coalescence of adjacent droplets . 
The researchers introduced the droplet fusion factor in order to calculate the necessary distance between two droplets to produce those filaments . 
The results showed that filament-like structures with a smooth surface and a nearly homogeneous cross section could be produced for suspensions with a dff of 44 % or higher . 
In a previous work , the same research group used the same process to print zirconia samples . 
They were able to produce ceramic parts with high density and homogeneous microstructures . 
On one hand the heating rates required for thermal debinding are very low and it must be carried out in a powder bed , increasing the time and complexity of the process . 
In another work of the same group , the authors combined AM and functionally graded materials to create zirconia-based customizable smart materials . 
By using T3DP technology , it was possible to selectively deposit two different materials beside each other , offering the prospect of combining suspensions with different contents of a pore forming agents to obtained components with dense and porous areas inside . 
The presence of zones with different porosities reduces the elastic modulus , diminishing the stress shielding , which should be benefic for dental implants . 
More , the presence of open pores shall favor the osteointegration . 
The work of Shao , showed the possibility of successfully printing ZrO2 ceramic parts by a new extrusion-based process , 3D Gel-Printing . 
The authors were able to produce printed and sintered cuboid samples with a regular appearance . 
Parameters such as surface roughness , relative density , hardness and transverse rupture strength of printed and sintered samples were compared with those obtained in other 3D printing processes . 
It was found that 3DGP led to samples with higher density , hardness and surface finishing than those obtained by syringe extrusion , and that presented higher transverse rupture strength than others produced by gel casting . 
More , no defects or deformation was observed from outside of the printed samples . 
The authors refer the importance of aspects such as printing conditions , rheological behavior of the slurry as well as the solid loading on the final properties of the printed/sintered samples . 
Faes combined the advantages of AM extrusion and UV curing into a single 3D printing technique , to obtain pieces with an high shape stability and green strength . 
This novel syringe-based AM process , based on the use of a photopolymerizable dispersion , leads to economic benefits since it reduces the raw material consumption . 
High shrinkage was observed during sintering , leading to cracking . 
This must be due to a low load of ceramic particles in the dispersion . 
It is suggested to increase the amount of ceramic particles , keeping the rheological behavior , which can be achieved through the introduction of steric repulsive forces in the dispersion , for example using other resins . 
5.2 Additive manufacturing of alumina 3 gathers the main findings of published work regarding the AM of alumina-based formulations with possible applications in the dental field . 
Work carried out by Scheithauer , showed the possibility of printing dense alumina pieces using 3D printing of high-filled suspensions with thermoplastic binder systems . 
The authors achieved samples with high densities , homogeneous microstructures and very good bonding between the printed layers . 
This study also highlights the importance of the rheological properties of the slurries , i.e . 
low viscosity allows an easy flow through the needle to form small droplets , which can improve the printing resolution . 
It is concluded that thermoplastic 3D printing presents several advantages over other suspension-based technologies , namely the fact that the green layer solidifying occur by simple cooling , the versatility of ceramic materials that can be used and the applicability in limited areas . 
It is recognized the potential of the technique to print multimaterial and multifunctional components , as well as to obtain pieces with material and/or property gradients in different dimensions . 
However , the authors claim that heating rates for thermal debinding must be very low and that the process must be performed in a powder bed . 
Dehurtevent , presented a study which provides promising results for manufacturing dense 3D alumina crown frameworks by SLA . 
The authors established a comparison between the physical and mechanical properties of SLA-manufactured alumina ceramics of different compositions and viscosity to those of subtractive-manufactured ceramics . 
Their results showed an acceptability window for viscosity of the slurries that allows producing SLA manufactured alumina pieces . 
Additionally , the authors were able to achieve a composition that originated a reliable material with the anisotropic shrinkage , high density , flexural strength , and Weibull characteristics suitable for SLA manufacturing . 
Nevertheless , it was observed that although an oversize of 35 % allow manufacturing complex morphologies , differential shrinkage led to deformation of the final structure . 
In the work of Maleksaeedi , a powder-bed inkjet 3D-printing and vacuum infiltration process was used for producing alumina parts with high density and improved mechanical properties . 
The authors utilized vacuum infiltration process to enhance the packing of the green parts after printing , by impregnating the 3D-printed parts with highly solid loaded slurries . 
Their results showed that the vacuum infiltration process was able to significantly increase the density , reduce the porosity and increase the strength of the 3D-printed alumina components . 
Moreover , the bending strength was improved up to 15 times of the original strength . 
5.3 Additive manufacturing of other ceramics The potential of AM has been explored in several dental applications with other ceramic materials .

More , it was observed new bone growth and scaffold resorption at bone/scaffold interfaces . 
Another work using robocasting technology is the one carried out by Slots in which porous TCP implants were developed using storable and reusable inks composed of fatty acid/TCP . 
The total fabrication time including ink preparation , printing and sintering was less than 5 h for 8 cm2 of implant . 
The printed implants were able to retain their shape after sintering and were chemically unchanged by the printing and sintering process . 
Mesenchymal stem cells were able to grow on the implants , secrete collagen and alkaline phosphate and mineralize the implant . 
Additionally , they possessed clinically relevant mechanical strength and presented osteoconductive properties . 
The process demonstrated to be sufficiently simple and effective to enable rapid , on-demand , in-hospital production of patient-specific ceramic implants for treatment of bone trauma . 
In the study conducted by Fahimipour , a biomimetic porous TCP/alginate/gelatin scaffold containing PLGA ) microspheres for slow release of VEGF was processed through extrusion technology . 
The printable ink was selected according to the gel point of different formulations of TCP/alginate/gelatin . 
The process faced some difficulties , for example in what concerns the needle blocking during extrusion if the gel point is above room temperature . 
Nevertheless , it was possible to achieve satisfactory mechanical and biological features supporting cell viability necessary for bone tissue regeneration.Tamimi , prepared customized 3D-printed monetite onlays by binder jetting . 
The onlays were design to facilitate the diffusion of cells and nutrients from high bone metabolic to low bone metabolic areas . 
The research showed that bone metabolic activity in onlays is anatomy-dependant and correlates with the ability of bone augmentation . 
The authors were able to achieve osseointegration of dental implants in bone augmented with the printed monetite onlays . 
Klammert also used binder jetting technology to produce several specific craniofacial implants of TCP . 
The printed parts were able to comply with geometric requirements and provide an adequate accuracy of fit , even though the authors did not use a commercial CAD solution . 
Fieldint and colleagues face several challenges to adapt and optimize the processing parameters to produce scaffolds using a 3D binder jetting printer and commercially available binders . 
The authors report that the addition of dopants to the ceramic powder decreased the to phase transformation of TCP sintered at 1250 Additionally , the density increased leading to a 250 % increase in compressive strength , when compared to pure TCP scaffolds . 
Shao prepared by extrusion , four groups of bioceramic scaffolds for treatment of bone defects : Mg-substituted wollastonite-based ; TCP-based ; wollastonite-based ; and bredigite-based . 
Additionally , CSi-Mg10 printed parts revealed the largest pore dimension but the lowest porosity , mainly due to the considerable shrinkage of the scaffolds during sintering . 
Asadi-Eydivand , prepared gypsum-based scaffolds also for the treatment of bone defects . 
They investigated the effect of thermic treatment on the structural , mechanical , and physical properties of samples produced by extrusion/jetting . 
For the lowest temperature , the samples showed adequate mechanical properties , but high cytotoxicity . 
In contrast , temperatures in the range of 500 led to lower cytotoxic scaffolds but insufficient mechanical strength . 
For temperatures higher than 1000 higher compressive strength and greater viability were observed . 
However , above 1200 decomposition of calcium sulfate occurs , leading to mass loss . 
5.4 Additive manufacturing of ceramic composites 5 gathers the information about AM of ceramic-based composites possible applications in dentistry . 
In the work carried out by Goyos-Ball porous robocasted structures made of 10 mol % ceria-stabilized zirconia and alumina composite were produced . 
The authors found that round lattice structures have compression strength similar to cortical bone , are not cytotoxic and induce osseous differentiation . 
More , the printed parts showed good aesthetics , chemical stability and negligible corrosion and wear .

The results of their work showed that the addition of fillers improved or maintained the strength and stiffness of the parts , while reducing toughness and flexibility . 
Melting behaviour of polyamide 12 did not depend on the processing techniques , but was affected by the addition of fillers and by the cooling rate . 
Incorporation of fillers improved the thermal stability . 
It was found that fuse deposition modelling allows producing medical implants with acceptable mechanical performances for non-load bearing applications . 
Jan manufactured ceramic objects by powder bed fusion , using selective laser melting technology . 
The authors were able to produce parts with good mechanical properties , with approximately 100 % density , without needing sintering processes or post-processing , which constitutes an advantage . 
The study reports some process challenges that need to be overcome , for instance , the thermally induced stresses , caused by the deposition of the new cold powder layers on top of the preheated ceramic , and the surface roughness values . 
6 Challenges Additive manufacturing is recognized as a promising technology with advantages not only in the production of customized healthcare products to improve population health and quality of life , but also by its possibility of decreasing environmental impact , enhancing the manufacturing sustainability . 
However , the inherent challenges of 3D printing should not be overlooked . 
Aspects such as surface quality , dimensional accuracy and the mechanical properties need improvement to allow producing effective high-quality products . 
Concerning surface quality , it depends on the AM used technique , processing conditions and raw material characteristics , which affect the thickness of each printed layer . 
Powder bed AM leads to lower surface quality than the other AM techniques , due to the presence of large and partially melted powder particles in the printed piecessurfaces . 
Relatively to the thickness of the printed layers , extrusion techniques typically lead to high layer thicknesses due to the large diameter of the deposition nozzle . 
Powder bed fusion and vat polymerization origin lower layer thicknesses due to the ability to precisely focus the energy beam radius . 
Material jetting techniques are the ones that produce the finest layer thickness due to the small jetted droplets . 
Dimensional accuracy is critical in the production of dental pieces , because these must fit tightly the needs of each patient . 
A variety of issues affects dimensional accuracy . 
The work of Lee summarizes the dimensional accuracy in different manufacturing processes . 
spreading compaction/densification of the powder within the layers , evaporation of material by laser/heat and shrinkage during solidification . 
Mechanical properties are influenced by the presence of defects : surface quality and porosity are critical factors . 
Different solutions have been proposed to reduce porosity . 
For example , choosing ceramic powders with an adequate granulometric distribution , adding dopants or a viscous liquid-forming phase , infiltrating the sintered body with vitreous materials and applying cold/hot isostatic pressure to the green body . 
Shrinkage is also a concern in AM processes since it affects significantly the pieces dimensions and may lead to cracking . 
The printing strategy needs to be optimized to prevent the impact of this phenomenon . 
Possible solutions to minimize this issue are : - Increasing the amount of ceramic particles in the pastes , while keeping the rheological behavior unchanged , which may be achieved adding steric dispersants - Adding to the mixture particles that can expand due to phase transformation or reaction during sintering - Decreasing the sintering temperature , without compromising density - Considering it in the CAD design of the parts . 
In most of the mentioned studies along this work , the ceramic materials are composed of mixtures of a sacrificial polymeric binder with ceramic particles for the production of the green product . 
This means that additional post-processing steps , such as sintering , are required to remove the binder and achieve a fully dense ceramic component . 
This is true for the majority of the AM technologies with few exceptions such as direct selective laser sintering and selective laser melting techniques , where the ceramic particles are directly sintered or melted , respectively . 
Dental ceramic pieces made by direct ink deposition still present low mechanical properties , compared to other conventional means to produce molded parts . 
Limitations of this layering technique include poor bonding adhesion between layers and the occurrence of porosity . 
The protocols should be as simple as possible , leading to slurries/inks with appropriate composition , flow consistency and behavior and specific viscoelastic properties . 
They should contain a high solid volume fraction not only to minimize shrinkage during drying and therefore resist the involved stresses , but also to increase the density of the final product . 
Another important challenge is bacteriological safety of the final products intended to be in close contact with tissues/organs . 
These structures must be able to endure strict sterilization protocols without losing their intrinsic properties . 
7 Final considerations Ceramic materials play an important role as dental materials . 
Their high chemical and mechanical resistance , as well as their aesthetic properties , make them an excellent option to replace damaged dental tissues . 
Conventional manufacturing methods to produce ceramic dental pieces are generally based on subtractive techniques . 
These lead to significant material and tool waste and present limitations in the production of parts with complex geometry . 
The rising demand for custom-tailored and patient specific dental products renders dentistry to be one of the rapidly expanding segments of additive manufacturing technologies . 
These technologies have been successfully used in many production sectors and present many advantages for processing dental structures , compared with subtracting technologies . 
These include less production steps with consequent impact in the total manufacturing time , lower consumables and raw materials consumption , and adequacy to produce very small and complex dental parts . 
It thus opens possibility to mass production of customized dental products , with evident benefit to the patients and/or healthcare systems . 
However , there are still concerns about application of AM to ceramics due to their intrinsically poor mechanical properties , the accuracy of the obtained pieces , their density and surface finishing . 
This comprehensive review shows that , dental bioceramics can be processed through AM by different techniques , e.g . 
material extrusion/jetting , vat polymerization , binder jetting , and powder bed fusion . 
The first technology is the most widely used . 
The studies confirmed that almost any shape could be produced , with different degrees of complexity . 
specific mechanical properties , different degrees of porosity and/or density , biodegradability , osteointegration and cytotoxicity . 
Despite the great potential for dental industry , the application of AM to ceramic dental materials is still under study . 
In resume , further developments of AM technology are expected to give a significant contribution to bring production costs down , improve manufactured materials properties and render the production processes more efficient and competitive . 
An interesting approach , when printing 3D complex dental ceramic structures , could be to combine the best attributes of AM technologies with conventional surface finishing methods . 
One of the critical issues in orthopaedic regenerative medicine is the design of bone scaffolds and implants that replicate the biomechanical properties of the host bones . 
Porous metals have found themselves to be suitable candidates for repairing or replacing the damaged bones since their stiffness and porosity can be adjusted on demands . 
Another advantage of porous metals lies in their open space for the in-growth of bone tissue , hence accelerating the osseointegration process . 
The fabrication of porous metals has been extensively explored over decades , however only limited controls over the internal architecture can be achieved by the conventional processes . 
Recent advances in additive manufacturing have provided unprecedented opportunities for producing complex structures to meet the increasing demands for implants with customized mechanical performance . 
At the same time , topology optimization techniques have been developed to enable the internal architecture of porous metals to be designed to achieve specified mechanical properties at will . 
Thus implants designed via the topology optimization approach and produced by additive manufacturing are of great interest . 
This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of topological design and manufacturing processes of various types of porous metals , in particular for titanium alloys , biodegradable metals and shape memory alloys . 
Bone is a complex tissue that continually undergoes dynamic biological remodelling , i.e. 
, the coupled process whereby osteoclasts resorb mature bone tissue followed by osteoblasts that generate new bone to maintain healthy homeostasis of bone . 
This unique feature of bone underpins its ability to remodel itself to repair damage . 
However , when a bone defect exceeds a critical non-healable size , external intervention is required to supplement self-healing if the defect is to be bridged . 
Despite recent advances in biomaterials and tissue engineering , repair of such a critical-sized bone defect still remains a challenge . 
The optimal choice is to use autograft . 
However , harvesting autograft tissue creates the morbidity associated with a second surgical site . 
The insufficiencies of application of autograft and allograft tissue have led to greater research efforts to identify biomimetic materials and structures that are suitable for skeletal repair without the inherent problems . 
Metals and alloys have a long history of application as bone implants . 
Among them , the use of stainless steels , cobalt based alloys , and titanium and its alloys are well established due to their good biocompatibility , satisfactory mechanical strength and superior corrosion resistance . 
However , implants made of these materials are usually much stiffer than natural bones , leading to stress shielding - a major source for bone resorption and eventual failure of such implants . 
Cortical bone has elastic moduli ranging from 3 to 30 GPa , while trabecular or cancellous bone has significantly lower elastic moduli of 0.02GPa . 
Most current implant materials have much higher moduli than those of bones , e.g. 
, Ti6Al4V has a modulus of around 110 GPa and CoCrMo alloys have a modulus of around 210 GPa . 
Therefore , to avoid stress shielding at the bone-implant interface , the equivalent Young 's modulus and yield stress have to be adjusted when using these bulk materials . 
An effective method is to introduce adjustable porosity or relative density as proposed by Gibson and Ashby for isotropic materials . 
Traditional methods for fabricating open-cell porous metals include liquid state processing , solid state processing , electro-deposition and vapour deposition . 
Although the shape and size of the pores can be adjusted by changing the parameters of these manufacturing processes , only a randomly organized porous structure can be achievable . 
However , additive manufacturing technologies can fabricate porous metals with predefined external shape and internal architecture . 
Metal-based additive manufacturing techniques , such as selective laser melting and electron beam melting , are computer controlled fabrication process based on layer-wise manufacturing principles . 
SLM and EBM are increasingly used for the fabrication of porous metals with complex architecture . 
Instead of using electron beam as the energy source in EBM , the SLM technology uses laser beam with adjustable wavelength . 
Therefore , EBM can only process conductive metals whereas SLM can process polymer or ceramics as well as metal . 
Furthermore , due to more diffuse energy , EBM process has larger minimum feature size , median powder particle size , layer thickness , resolution and surface finish . 
The robust application of MAM technologies requires extensive material , process and design knowledge , specific to each MAM technology . 
MAM system behaviour is subject to significant stochastic error and experimental uncertainties , requiring that are necessary to simplify the problem . 
Sources of error include : complex and transient heat transfer phenomena , geometric effects with poorly defined powder thermal properties . 
MAM prediction error can lead to excess melt pool temperature , resulting in undesirable microstructure , residual stress , local porosity , and surface roughness . 
Understanding the effects of design decisions on temperature related process defects is critically important to the process control . 
Comprehensive reviews of AM technologies can be found elsewhere . 
Recent successes in orthopaedic regenerative medicine have promised an exciting future of AM technology . 
The world 's first additively manufactured mandible was implanted in a patient by Dr. Jules Poukens and his team in 2012 in Belgium . 
A full lower jaw implant was coated with hydroxyapatite and implanted in an 83 year old lady .

Typical design and application approaches of porous metallic implants normally include the design of scaffold , AM and post-processing as illustrated in 1 . 
This review aims to identify the current status and the future directions of design-oriented AM technology in producing porous metallic structures for bone tissue repair , with a particular emphasis on topological design of internal architecture of porous metals for bone implants . 
2 Structure and properties of bone 2.1 Structure of bone Bone is a natural composite containing both organic components and inorganic crystalline mineral , as illustrated in 2 . 
The structure of bone is similar to reinforced concrete that is used in the building industry . 
The function of HA crystals and collagen molecules are like the steel rod and cement to concrete : one part provides flexibility and the other provides strength and toughness . 
Type-I collagen is a triple helix of nm in diameter and nm in length . 
It is the primary organic components of bone . 
Other non-collagenous proteins include glycoproteins and bone specific proteoglycans . 
Hydroxyapatite is the inorganic component of bone and is plate-shaped of 50 25 nm in size and 1.5nm thick . 
The HA crystals are oriented in a periodic array in the fibrils , preferentially with their c axis parallel to the collagen fibrils . 
% of the dry bone . 
Bone has a hierarchical structure . 
The hierarchical levels of bone include macroscale , microscale , sub-microscale , nanoscale , and sub-nanoscale . 
The macroscale level represents the overall shape of the bone . 
Bone can be classified as compact bone , and trabecular bone . 
Compact bone is almost solid , with only spaces for osteocytes , canaliculi , blood vessels , and erosion cavities etc . 
There are large spaces in trabecular bone . 
The pores in trabecular bone are filled with bone marrow , and the porosity varies between 50 and 90 % . 
The building block of compact bone is the osteons , which are of the size ranging from 10 to 500 whereas the trabecular bone is made of a porous network of trabeculae . 
At the micron- and nano-scales , aggregated type-I collagen and HA form the collagen fibril . 
The reinforced collagen fibre is a universal building element for both compact and trabecular bones . 
2.2 Mechanical properties of bone Mechanical properties of bone vary significantly with age , anatomical site and bone quality . 
Among the various biomechanical properties of bone , elastic modulus has attracted the most research interest because of its critical importance for characterizing various bone pathologies and guiding artificial implant design . 
The elastic modulus and strength of bone are anisotropic . 
Compact bone is both stronger and stiffer when loaded longitudinally along the diaphyseal axis than the radial transverse directions . 
Trabecular bone is an anisotropic and porous composite . 
Like many biological materials , trabecular bone displays time-dependent behaviour as well as damage susceptibility during cyclic loading . 
The mechanical properties of trabecular bone depend on not only the porosity , but also the architectural arrangement of the individual trabeculae . 
The physical and mechanical properties of human bone are summarized in 1 . 
2.3 Requirements for the design of orthopaedic implants A successful porous metallic implant would restore the function of bone and promote regeneration of bone tissue at the damaged site . 
An ideal bone scaffold should possess the following characteristics : biocompatibility ; suitable surface for cell attachment , proliferation and differentiation ; highly porous with an interconnected pore network for cell ingrowth and transport of nutrients and metabolic waste ; mechanical properties to match the requirements of the surrounding tissues to reduce or eliminate stress shielding , and to meet anatomic loading requirements to avoid mechanical failure . 
Porous metals are implanted to repair bone defects of critical size and , in most cases , serve as load-bearing devices . 
Bone is usually anisotropic with different stiffness and strength in different directions , but normally there are no extremely weak directions . 
Therefore , suitable porous metals will approximate the stiffness of surrounding bones , making them effective for load transfer and alleviating the stress shielding effect . 
The key characteristics to design porous metallic implants include the careful selection of porosity , pore size , and pore interconnectivity , aiming to achieve satisfactory clinical outcomes . 
These structural features have a profound effect on mechanical properties and biological performance of the metallic implants . 
Bone regeneration in porous implants in vivo involves recruitment and penetration of cells from the surrounding bone tissue and vascularization . 
Higher porosity may facilitate these processes and benefit the bone ingrowth . 
For instance , more bone ingrowth was found in porous titanium coatings of higher porosity after the implants were placed into a canine model for 8 weeks . 
Similarly , bone ingrowth was shown to be deeper and greater in porous polymer scaffolds of higher porosity . 
The influence of pore size on the bone ingrowth is still controversial in literature . 
The optimal pore size for mineralized bone ingrowth is claimed to be 100in the research by Itala . 
They implanted triangle-shaped titanium implants of different plate thickness with pore size ranging from 50 to 125 into rabbit femur and found that there was no clear lower limit of pore size for consistent bone ingrowth . 
Recently Braem assessed the feasibility of early bone ingrowth into a predominantly microporous Ti coating in the compact bone of rabbit tibiae and found that new bone formed in micropores of less than 10 Large pores are believed to favour vascularization . 
Bai suggested an upper limit of pore size for vascularization , 400 beyond which no significant difference was observed with increasing pore size . 
Kuboki found that , when the pore size ranged from 300 to 400 the implantation of porous hydroxyapatite scaffolds into rats showed higher alkaline phosphates activity , osteocalcin content and bone ingrowth . 
However , Naoya implanted 300 600 and 900 AM manufactured porous Ti scaffolds into rabbit tibia and they found 600 and 900 scaffolds demonstrated significantly higher bone ingrowth than 300 scaffolds . 
In addition to vascularization , specific surface area of scaffolds is another essential factor with respect to fixation ability . 
Scaffolds with smaller pores are considered to have larger surface area and therefore more space for bone tissue ingrowth . 
Another important feature of bone implants is the permeability of the porous metal since the transportation of cells , nutrients and growth factors require the flow of blood through the porous scaffolds . 
In simple terms , permeability is characterised by using gradient pressure to push liquid through porous material . 
Zhang stated that permeability may influence vascular invasion and the supply of nutrients required to sustain cell growth and may also provide an outlet for the removal of cell debris , thereby increasing its osteoconductive potential . 
High permeability of titanium implants enhances the osseointegration process . 
Further research on the effect of permeability of porous metallic implants is in demand . 
In summary , porosity , pore size and pore interconnectivity are key factors that will significantly influence the mechanical properties and biological performance of scaffolds such as bone ingrowth and transportation of cells and nutrients . 
For example , increasing the porosity may enhance the biological processes , but it can decrease the stiffness and strength drastically . 
Therefore , finding the optimal topologies for scaffolds is of critical importance . 
However , conventional CAD-based design techniques are inefficient and usually fail to obtain the optimal scaffold design because a prohibitively large number of trials would be required in order to achieve a balanced performance , e.g. 
, desirable stiffness and good permeability . 
On the contrary , topology optimization techniques are capable of quickly finding the optimal topologies which satisfy multiple objectives and constraints simultaneously to provide site-specific biological performance . 
3 Topological design of porous metallic structures for orthopaedic implants 3.1 Porous metallic implants and topology optimization techniques As mentioned previously , bone is a 3D inhomogeneous structure with elaborate features from macro-to nano-scales . 
While it is impossible , and perhaps unnecessary , to recreate all details of natural bone in the porous metallic implant , ideally the implant should have similar hierarchical configurations on multiple scales . 
It is essential that the implant should possess properties similar to the host bone and the ambient tissue . 
This calls for a well-established design methodology integrating structural stiffness with fluid permeability to allow the implant to have both adequate rigidity to resist the physical loading and sufficient permeability to transfer cells , nutrients , etc . 
Fully solid metals , e.g . 
Such a stiffness mismatch is regarded as one of the most significant problems in implant design as the resulting stress shielding would often lead to implantation failures . 
Recently , porous metals were used in orthopaedic surgeries to replace damaged bones . 
Porous scaffolds are geometrically similar to natural hard tissues which are composed of constituting materials penetrated by interconnected pores . 
Porous metals can be designed to duplicate the properties of bones if their structures could be designed digitally and fabricated using advanced manufacturing technology . 
Conventional porous scaffolds typically consist of a vast number of randomly shaped pores in different sizes and therefore it is almost impossible to quantitatively analyse their properties . 
To obtain a simplified model , researchers usually assume that scaffolds are constructed of periodically-repeating unit cells along all directions and the architecture of the micro unit cells can distinctly define the macro properties of the scaffolds . 
Typical traditional design strategies of periodic bone scaffolds include Computer Aided Design , image-based design and implicit surfaces , as illustrated in 3 . 
CAD-based design are obtained by using various CAD tools . 
Computer-aided system for tissue scaffolds is a further development based on these scaffold libraries , aiming to efficiently automate the entire design process for desired topologies . 
Bio-inspired design is an alternative to improve the mechanical performance of bone scaffolds and enrich the scaffold library . 
Other CAD-based approaches may also be used in designing scaffolds . 
Image-based design , as proposed by Hollister , is based on Computed Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Image data for reconstruction of a defect . 
It uses Boolean combination of defect image and architecture image to create 3D scaffold image . 
Implicit surface modelling uses single mathematical equations to freely introduce pore shapes such as triply periodic minimal surfaces , which is highly flexible in designing scaffolds . 
CAD-based randomization approach starts from cell elements to fill a specific volume in computer software , where standard cell elements are usually packaged while new cell elements can also be created . 
This method can effectively imitate real bones by the randomization process , thus promoting the bone attachment and bone cell in-growth , as well as increasing the damage tolerance . 
While the aforementioned methods enable scaffolds to obtain desirable stiffness and permeability , these approaches demand a vast number of attempts to achieve anticipated properties . 
One of the main challenges in the application of porous scaffolds to orthopaedic implants is the adaptation of their mechanical and biomedical properties to those of natural bones . 
The implanted scaffolds are placed in a complex environment and their performance is affected by many factors . 
Some of them such as high permeability and good stiffness are competing with each other since a larger pore size is obtained usually at the cost of a lower mechanical strength . 
Hence , to increase the mass transfer , while retaining a strong supporting framework , there is a need to maintain a delicate trade-off between the porosity of the fabricated scaffold and its strength . 
Topology optimization a mathematical method capable of rearranging the materials to attain desired properties while satisfying prescribed constraints can complement the trial-and-error approach and provide a powerful tool to design complex scaffolds with features on multiple scales . 
It is a branch of computational mechanics and was originally developed in structural engineering . 
It has been widely used for designing structures and materials for desirable mechanical performance and physical properties . 
Through two decades of development , this method has gone far beyond the traditional structural engineering context . 
Typically , there are two ways to define a structure in topology optimization . 
The first is a point-by-point description in which a void or a solid phase in a local element is represented by an elemental density . 
The Evolutionary Structural Optimization and the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization methods use this type of description and have gained considerable success in solving a wide range of engineering optimization problems . 
In the field of computational material design , the topology optimization approach is termed as an homogenizationmethod because the homogenization method is used to calculate the effective properties of a unit cell and the material distribution is rearranged through topology optimization to enable the material to attain target properties . 
The seminal work of inverse homogenization was conducted by Sigmund in the 1990s for the design of materials with prescribed elastic properties . 
Thereafter , great achievements were obtained in the design of exceptional material properties including negative thermal expansion coefficient and negative refraction index . 
Later , this method was extended to the design of scaffold materials with their stiffness matrices matching those of anisotropic native bones . 
By using the SIMP based structural optimization , Guest and Prevost developed a topology optimization technique to find a scaffold with pores in the shape of a Schwartz primitive structure , resulting in the maximum permeability . 
They also combined bulk modulus and permeability in a single objective function and tailored these two competing properties in a multi-physics optimization problem . 
Using a similar density-based optimization method , scaffolds with elastic tensors similar to those of natural bones were designed ; and the performance of these scaffolds in subsequent tissue ingrowth was investigated . 
It is found that bone remodeling is at its best when the scaffold elastic tensor matches or is slightly higher than the elastic properties of the host bone . 
The last row in 3 shows the porous structures with the maximum bulk and shear moduli , respectively , at a given porosity . 
These unit cells were obtained using the Bi-directional Evolutionary Structural Optimization method , which shows faster convergence and unambiguous material definition . 
The BESO method , which allows the material to be added and removed simultaneously during the optimization process , is an extension of the original evolutionary ESO method proposed by Xie and Steven . 
As shown in 3 on topology optimization , various unit cells with maximal bulk modulus , maximal shear modulus , prescribed stiffness ratios in three directions , and functionally graded structures can be obtained through the BESO method . 
The second class of topology optimization methods , represented by the level-set algorithm , focus on tracking phase boundaries . 
The level-set method provides an effective technique to represent smooth boundaries and to control topology changes . 
A variational level-set technique for periodic material design problems governed by Navierand Maxwell 's equations was developed to attain material with maximal permeability . 
Level-set topology optimization enables the no-slip boundary condition of fluids in Stokes flow to be naturally satisfied . 
Periodic structures of scaffolds with the maximal effective diffusivity aimed at providing an ideal environment for nutrient transportation were studied by a level-set based optimization method . 
There have been tremendous advances in recent years in the area of using topology optimization techniques to design multi-functional materials with periodic structures , as shown in a comprehensive review by Cadman . 
Several of these developments are directly related to the design of scaffolds . 
Both stiffness and diffusive transport properties were considered by Hollister and Challis . 
Using topology optimization , Hollister and co-workers also created an interbody fusion cage for improved arthrodesis . 
The outcomes of their research were used in clinic to support bone regeneration for craniofacial reconstruction . 
3.2 Constraints in structural design for additive manufacturing Although AM can theoretically produce structures in any shape , the quality of the structures may vary significantly depending on the design and fabrication parameters . 
Therefore , it is necessary to consider the processability of the designed parts during the topological design process , including the constraints and limitations of AM technologies . 
However , there is still limited research on creating design guidelines to achieve this goal . 
Kranz experimentally investigated the restrictions of Laser Additive Manufacturing of Ti6Al4V and presented a comprehensive structured catalogue . 
In their research , restrictions and recommendations were presented based on experimental measurements of different characteristics such as cavities , walls , bores , gap , hollow cylinder , overhangs and support structures . 
They also found that the quality of AM parts was highly dependent on the materials , machines and process parameters . 
Therefore , similar guidelines could be achieved through similar methodology on different material systems . 
Among many parameters , frequently discussed one includes overhanging structures , which may lead to some undesirable defects . 
In an AM process , the overhanging structure is not supported by solidified section or bottom substrate when it is being built . 
Therefore , the overhanging structure is strongly influenced by the orientation of building - ) . 
Therefore , the critical fabrication angle is of great importance since it determines the form of overhanging structure , hence the processability . 
4 shows the sketch of a circular pore with overhanging arc AB , which can be processable if the fabrication angle were larger than the critical value c. Otherwise , supporting structures have to be used , which are normally avoided to prevent damage of parts in post-processing . 
A better choice in design is to adopt structures with special geometrical arrangement such as an octahedral lattice , whose lateral schematic is shown in 4 . 
When the downward sloping surface CD has a larger fabrication angle than the critical angle c , no supporting structures are required . 
There were also attempts to design structures so that they could be fabricated using AM without support . 
This approach is interesting and useful , but may not be generally applicable to scaffold designs . 
Other researchers examined the suitability of using SIMP and BESO topology optimization algorithms to design structures for AM . 
4 Current status of AM and topology optimization in producing porous metallic structures AM technologies are superior to conventional fabrication techniques for producing porous metallic implants with complex and customized structures , as shown in 5 . 
In addition to the geometric flexibility , composites with two or more phases can be manufactured . 
These advantages enable AM to become a promising tool for the production of biomedical implant devices , controlled drug delivery systems , and engineered tissues . 
Examples include artificial joints and load-bearing implants produced by AM using biocompatible materials such as hydroxyapatite , Ti , Ta and Coalloys and customized prostheses such as intervertebral spacers . 
There has been growing research interest in using topology optimization to design bone scaffolds and orthopaedic implants , however significant challenges still remain before these concepts could be used in clinical practice . 
An important issue that may not be neglected when applying topology optimization to scaffold design is to consider the differences in physical , chemical and mechanical properties of base materials produced by AM and conventional fabrication techniques . 
The material property in AM process may greatly affect the final topological shape of scaffold , which may differ from the original CAD model obtained from topology optimization . 
Moreover , good understanding of the change in mechanical properties in AM process may assist more accurate optimal design in topology optimization procedure . 
This section will review the status of research on AM fabrication of three main families of alloys and the application of topology optimization . 
4.1 Biocompatible Ti alloys Metals in biological systems may experience corrosion and release ions , which may result in many adverse physiological effects . 
Therefore , the biocompatibility of any implant must be quantified to decrease the patient 's risk and the failure of the implantation . 
The cytotoxicity of typical surgical implant alloys and pure metals have been broadly studied in the past decades . 
It is now commonly accepted that vanadium may cause sterile abscess and aluminium may cause scar tissue , whereas titanium , zirconium , niobium and tantalum exhibit excellent biocompatibility . 
Another important motivation behind the design of biocompatible Ti alloys is the opportunity to decrease the modulus of Ti alloys by adding elements . 
As mentioned above , the elements should be biocompatible . 
Various Ti alloys composed of low modulus biocompatible elements were developed . 
These alloys exhibited lower modulus than the commonly used Ti6Al4V . 
One example is Ti13Nb13Zr , which showed improved bone biocompatibility and a modulus of 79 GPa . 
Other Ti alloys which exhibited lower modulus included Ti29Nb13Ta4.6Zr and Ti35Nb5Ta7Zr . 
In recent years , AM produced porous Ti alloy scaffolds were widely reported with Ti6Al4V in dominance , such as the Ti6Al4V implants in sheep cervical spine in 5 . 
Ryan combined the multi-stage AM technology with the powder metallurgy process to produce porous Ti alloy scaffolds using wax templates generated by CAD . 
The pore size of their designs ranged from 200 to 400 and the porosity reached 66.8 % . 
This method could achieve controlled porous structure and ensure high resolution in manufacturing . 
The resulting microstructure and surface roughness were similar to parts manufactured by conventional methods . 
This method could also be extended to the fabrication of other metallic structures which are difficult to be directly made by AM . 
Murr manufactured different porous Ti6Al4V implants using AM based on micro-CT scan and CAD models built by Materialise software . 
They studied the influence of geometric features of unit cells on the mechanical properties of the porous structures and found that when the porosity changed from 59 % to 88 % , the elastic modulus decreased from 3.03 to 0.58 GPa , which proved that the elastic modulus of porous metals could be readily adjusted through the porosity . 
Similarly Pattanyak studied porous Ti implants based on micro-CT scan on human cancellous bones , which focused on structures with complicated internal structures for bone ingrowth applications . 
The implants were manufactured via SLM using Ti powder of less than 45 in size . 
They found that the compressive strength decreased from 120 to 35 MPa when the porosity changed from 55 % to 75 % . 
Hollander produced a variety of Ti6Al4V implants , ranging from porous cylinder to solid human vertebra model with irregular shapes . 
Porous Ti6Al4V structures were shown to be effective in supporting cell growth and new bone tissue growth , and cell based study suggested that Ti6Al4V possesses high cyto-biocompatibility . 
In vitro studies were performed with porous Ti6Al4V structures . 
Cell spreading and proliferation were observed across the entire surface and inside the porous structure . 
Porous Ti6Al4V scaffolds were found performing well in animal models since induced new bone growth and osseointegration were achieved on both bare and surface-coated porous Ti6Al4V structures . 
Although porous Ti6Al4V had been widely studied , the potential release of toxic ions led researchers towards looking for safer alternative alloys . 
Therefore , Ti alloys such as Ti24Nb4Zr8Sn , Ti7.5Mo and Ti40Nb were designed and fabricated by AM , which exhibited comparable mechanical properties to their counterparts by conventional manufacturing approaches . 
There was significant research interest in using topology optimization for the design of porous Ti alloy scaffolds . 
While early works mainly focused on the theoretical consideration of the structural design of the unit cells , recent efforts put more emphasis on integrating topology optimization with AM , e.g . 
Refs.. 4.2 Shape memory alloys Shape Memory Alloys are capable of regaining their original shape after severe deformations when stimulated by external environments . 
Due to this unique property , SMAs have found their way in orthopaedic implant applications . 
Typical SMAs include NiTi or nitinol which normally contains approximately 50 at % Ni and 50 at % Ti . 
The shape memory effect in NiTi comes from the austenite/martensite phase transformation since martensite is a low temperature stable phase with the absence of stress whereas austenite is a high temperature stable phase . 
Currently , more than 90 % of all commercial SMAs are based on NiTi and its ternary alloys - NiTiCu and NiTiNb . 
Solid NiTi has a modulus of 48 GPa , which is much lower than other Ti alloys . 
Furthermore , NiTi allows for relatively large reversible deformation of up to 8 % . 
NiTi has higher stiffness than bone under tendon , and is able to deform over a large strain range at an almost constant stress . 
Due to these characteristics , NiTi has been widely used in medical devices , such as surgical tools , stents , orthodontic wires , plates and staples for bone fractures . 
Main attractive features of SMAs are : capability to recover the original shape after large deformation , capability to recover the original shape from a stable deformed shape when heated and a high damping capacity . 
For biomedical applications , the presence of Ni in NiTi has been a continuous concern since Ni is one of the highest sensitivities in metallic allergy tests . 
Therefore , attempts were made either to develop surface modification techniques or to use substitution elements to mitigate this effect without sacrificing the biocompatibility . 
For example , TiNb and the related TiNbX system were developed which exhibited elastic strains as high as 4.2 % . 
Common methods for making porous NiTi structures are based on powder metallurgy and self-propagating high temperature synthesis of a mixture of elemental powders or pre-alloyed NiTi powder with space holding materials . 
After removing space holding materials at relatively low temperature , the structures are further sintered at high temperature . 
Due to high reactivity of Ti and Ni , the sintering of porous structures is normally done in high vacuum . 
However , these methods have difficulties in precisely controlling the porous structures of NiTi , i.e. 
, pore size and pore shape . 
To overcome this problem , AM technologies such as SLM have been used to produce NiTi implants . 
It was shown that AM produced NiTi parts exhibited similar mechanical properties as those fabricated by conventional methods such as casting . 
In contrary to the substantial research on Ti alloys , no reports on the application of topology optimization in the design of SMA scaffolds involving AM fabrication can be found in the literature up to date . 
4.3 Biodegradable metals Biodegradable materials , including both polymer-based and metal-based ones , are used for some medical implants which will gradually degrade in human body over a period of time . 
In some clinical cases , biomaterials are only needed temporarily in the body and are expected to support the healing process and to disappear after the healing process is completed . 
5 shows a biodegradable Mg stent after expansion . 
Compared to polymer-based materials , biodegradable metals have higher stiffness and strength , and are more suitable for load bearing conditions . 
As the degradable alloys are expected to degrade inside human body , the main compositions of the alloys should be metallic elements that can be metabolized , and demonstrate appropriate degradation rates in the human body . 
Due to its unique characteristics , Mg alloys were used to manufacture cardiovascular stents and bone screws . 
The degradable magnesium alloy bone screws were found clinically equivalent to the conventional Ti screws ; and no foreign body reaction , osteolysis , or systemic inflammatory reaction were observed for the Mg alloy screws . 
A key parameter that needs to be considered in designing a biodegradable metallic implant is its degradation rate in human body . 
Pure Mg is known to have a fast degradation in high chloride physiological environment but it may produce hydrogen gas at a high rate from corrosion , which can not be dealt with by the host tissue . 
Fe-based biodegradable materials are known to exhibit a slow degradation rate . 
Animal tests showed that large portions of the pure Fe stent remained intact in the blood vessels 12 months post-surgery . 
Alloying is a typical method to adjust the degradation rate of a metal . 
For instance , by adding elements such as Y , Sr , Zn , Zr and Ca , Mg alloys were shown to have much lower degradation rates in comparison with pure Mg . 
Such alloys also exhibited high strength , which is desirable for load-bearing applications . 
In addition to alloying , amorphous structures like metallic glass alloys MgZnCa showed low degradation rate and high strength . 
However , metallic glass alloys are generally difficult to manufacture , which would add the cost to the application of this type of material . 
Porous Mg alloy implants were investigated as temporary bone replacements in an animal model . 
They were shown to be able to enhance bone remodelling and appropriate host response . 
However , porous Mg alloys degrade too rapidly in vivo , which may leave subcutaneous gas cavities . 
Since an open porous implant has large surface area , only alloys with slow degradation rate should be considered for making the porous structure , e.g . 
Mg-4 wt. 
% Y . 
The element yttrium helps promote grain refinement , thus resulting in a slow degradation and sufficient cyto-compatibility . 
Nguyen manufactured porous Mg alloys using SLM and suggested that the dimension , surface morphology and the oxygen pick-up of the laser-melted Mg were strongly dependent on the laser processing parameters . 
Due to the high evaporation rate at elevated temperatures , few attempts were made to fabricate Mg scaffolds directly using AM . 
Instead , a technique combining 3D printing and gravity casting was shown to be effective in producing topologically-ordered porous Mg structures , where a porous NaCl mould was created using SLM and then Mg alloy was cast into the mould . 
After removing the NaCl , porous Mg structure with porosity of 41 % and pore size of 1 mm was obtained . 
The compressive strength of the porous Mg was reported to be 13 MPa , which is comparable to porous Mg produced by powder metallurgy . 
A review on porous biodegradable metals for hard tissue scaffolds can be found in Ref.. A theoretical study of topological design of polymeric scaffolds considering the effect of biodegradation was conducted by Chen . 
No reports on the application of topology optimization in the design of biodegradable metallic scaffolds involving AM fabrication have appeared in the literature so far . 
5 Heat-treatment and surface modification of porous metallic structures produced by AM 5.1 Heat-treatment The mechanical properties of AM produced materials depend heavily on the processing parameters , including building layer thickness , scan speed , energy density and focal offset distance . 
Usually AM produced materials have relatively high yield stress and ultimate tensile strength , but a relatively low ductility . 
In order to improve the mechanical properties of AM produced porous biomaterials so that they can mimic the human tissues and fulfil the desired functions , post-treatment is of critical importance . 
It is known that the microstructures of as-built materials by AM are very different from those by traditional casting or forging approaches . 
AM is a layer-wise build-up process with high cooling rates that lead to significant internal thermal stresses in the structure . 
During the building process , the scanning by either a laser or an electron beam may cause the instabilities of the melt pool , resulting in increased porosity and high surface roughness . 
The post-treatment process also enables the reduction of thermal stresses in AM produced structures . 
For Ti6Al4V , post heat-treatment is typically performed within the + region , which can control the morphology and size of the without significantly influencing the prior-grain size . 
A proper heat-treatment process may substantially improve the mechanical properties of AM produced materials . 
Thone observed significant improvement in ductility and fatigue strength after heat-treatment of SLM produced Ti6Al4V . 
They revealed that the tensile strength of heat-treated Ti6Al4V slightly decreased from 1080 MPa to 945 MPa but the elongation at failure increased significantly from 1.6 % to 11.6 % , along with remarkably prolonged fatigue life of parts from 28,900 to 290,000 cycles . 
The improvements in the mechanical properties after post heat-treatment are mainly due to the elimination of thermal stresses and the changes of microstructures . 
On the other hand , an adequate selection of AM processing variables can facilitate in-situ heat treatment . 
The microstructure of Ti6Al4V made by SLM is often dominated by martensite due to rapid cooling , which can be decomposed to lamellar + structure during SLM process by tuning the processing variables . 
After the optimization of processing conditions , Xu produced Ti6Al4V with comparable or better mechanical properties than forged Ti6Al4V . 
5.2 Surface modification Surface modification plays an important role in enhancing the biological performance of AM produced porous biomaterials , particularly bioactivity and biocompatibility . 
Ti alloys are normally covered by one layer of 3nm thick native oxide , namely TiO2 , which provides excellent chemical inertness , corrosion resistance and biocompatibility . 
In the human body , Ti alloy implants may experience non-specific protein adsorption and interrogation of neutrophils and macrophages , which may attract fibroblasts to an encapsulation process . 
To ensure an effective biological bond between Ti alloy implants and surrounding bones , surface modification is essential to improve the conductivity of bones or the bioactivity of titanium . 
The surface morphology of Ti alloy implants depends on the history of material processing . 
For AM produced porous Ti alloys , powders tend to become small liquid spheres when heated up by laser or electron beams . 
Such a effect is a complex metallurgical process that leads to a rough surface and residual powder particles . 
These loosely connected powder particles can be removed through blasting or other post-processing methods before implantation . 
Surface modification or activation of Ti surface can be achieved by various techniques such as plasma spray , physical or chemical vapour deposition , ion implantation , electrochemical oxidation , acidic or alkali etching , solheat-treatment , and surface machining or grinding . 
For porous metallic structures , there are two main approaches , based on surface coating and surface corrosion . 
A popular coating-based method is solprocess , which is a simple yet versatile method for creating oxide coatings at relatively low temperatures . 
For implants with a complex topology , dip coating is normally used . 
The solprocess may deposit thin inorganic coatings . 
The chemical composition and microstructures of the coating can be better controlled by the solprocess than by other methods . 
Brie used solto form a bioceramic coating on porous Ti6Al7Nb implants . 
The coating uniformly covered the external and internal surfaces of the implants ; and the coated porous structures exhibited improved biocompatibility . 
Other methods include electrolytic deposition and plasma spray . 
ED can produce CaP coatings having a thickness of a few microns to several hundred microns , which can be controlled by applying appropriate current density and processing time . 
This may also assist to control the surface morphology of CaP coatings from needle-like to plate-like structures . 
Coating through ED can produce uniformly and fully covered surface , which makes it suitable for functionalizing porous structures . 
Chai found that the bioactivity of the CaP coated Ti6Al4V scaffold to ) was significantly improved and it was possible to produce osteoinductive for the repair of bone defects . 
Corrosion-based surface treatment involves interfacial chemical reactions of structures in corrosive solution . 
Such chemical processes include alkali treatment , acid etching and anodization treatments . 
5 to show the surface morphology of scaffold before and after HCl etching treatment . 
The chemical reaction may produce a thin oxide layer on the surface of the metal , usually resulting in improved bioactivity . 
The thickness of the active layer can be controlled from tens of nanometer to hundreds of microns by adjusting processing variables . 
Alkali treatment was initially introduced by Kim to improve the bioactivity of Ti implants owing to a biologically active bone-like apatite layer on Ti surface . 
Anodization is a mature electrochemical process capable of producing protective layers on the metal surface with adjustable surface microstructure and crystal structure . 
Special care should be taken with regard to the possible negative effect on mechanical properties after corrosion-based surface treatment . 
It was reported that alkali treatment might result in the deterioration of mechanical strength of porous Ti alloy scaffolds and also cause the embrittlement of the struts in the scaffolds . 
6 Challenges and future directions Additive manufacturing provides unprecedented opportunities for producing customized medical implants as this technology can fabricate structures of complex external shapes and intricate internal architectures . 
Topology optimization has become a powerful digital tool for the design of optimal structures and materials . 
The integration of these two technologies sees a promising future in designing and manufacturing biocompatible orthopaedic implants with desired mechanical properties and minimal side effects on patients in clinical applications . 
Key challenges and future directions in integrating the two technologies are as follows : i ) A comprehensive and reliable database containing detailed information on the mechanical and biological properties of human bones is yet to be established . 
This database should include properties of bones for different age , gender groups and at different locations . 
Such information is required as the design of the topology optimization process . 
ii ) Sophisticated topology optimization algorithms capable of dealing with multi-functional designs on multiple length scales simultaneously needs to be developed . 
Preliminary studies along this line can be found in Refs.. iii ) Topological design of the lattice structures that can be easily produced by AM and exhibit anisotropic mechanical properties similar to human bones is another promising direction , despite that the fact that there has been extensive research on topology optimization based on continuum models . 
iv ) Constraints and limitations of current AM technologies , such as the critical angle of the overhanging structure and the difficulty in removing the supporting structure , should be involved in newly-developed topology optimization algorithms so that the designs could actually be fabricated by AM . 
v ) The long-term in vivo material/biological performance of porous metallic implants that are designed through topology optimization techniques and produced by AM needs to be rigorously assessed in order to ascertain the advantages and drawbacks of such implants . 
vi ) Novel alloying systems capable of enhancing the mechanical and biological performance of porous metallic implants are in great demand , together with new post-treatment technologies for improving the bioactivity and biocompatibility . 
7 Conclusions In this paper , the current status of the topological design of porous metallic implants and the fabrication of such implants using additive manufacturing is reviewed . 
First the mechanical properties of human bones are discussed . 
Then it is demonstrated that topology optimization is a powerful digital tool that can be used to obtain optimal internal architectures for porous implants which not only satisfy multifunctional requirements but also mimic human bones . 
Furthermore it is shown that additive manufacturing is the most promising and disruptive technology in the fabrication of porous orthopaedic implants designed through topology optimization . 
To further improve the mechanical and biological performance of these structures , both post-treatment and surface modification are necessary . 
Based on these discussions , challenges and future directions of the integration topology optimization with additive manufacturing are identified . 
This review provides useful information to researchers and practitioners who are working in various areas of the truly multidisciplinary topic of bone implant design and fabrication Additive manufacturing of polymer-fiber composites has transformed AM into a robust manufacturing paradigm and enabled producing highly customized parts with significantly improved mechanical properties , compared to un-reinforced polymers . 
Almost all commercially available AM methods could benefit from various fiber reinforcement techniques . 
Recent developments in 3D printing methods of fiber reinforced polymers , namely , fused deposition modeling , laminated object manufacturing , stereolithography , extrusion , and selective laser sintering are reviewed in this study to understand the trends and future directions in the respective areas . 
In addition to extra strength , fibers have also been used in 4D printing to control and manipulate the change of shape or swelling after 3D printing , right out of the printing bed . 
Although AM of fiber/polymer composites are increasingly developing and under intense attention , there are some issues needed to be addressed including void formation , poor adhesion of fibers and matrix , blockage due to filler inclusion , increased curing time , modelling , simulation , etc . 
Additive manufacturing , also known as 3D printing , is defined asa process of adding materials to fabricate objects from three-dimensional models in successive layers , versus traditional subtractive manufacturing methods . 
Numerous novel AM processes have been developed over the span of more than 20years of AM development with applications in aerospace , automotive , biomedical , digital art , architectural design , etc . 
There has been an exponential increase in AM technology in recent years and it continues to grow due to its versatility and low cost for rapid prototyping and manufacturing applications . 
All of these features , combined with AMcustomizability to fabricate complex monolithic structures and geometries , with micrometer resolution , helped AM grow to a multibillion-dollar industry . 
To date , the dominant part of the 3D printing industry has immensely relied on single material printing . 
This issue , paired with limited choices of available resins compatible with commercial printers , has severely limited variations in the physical and chemical properties of 3D printed objects . 
These limitations have led to development of multi-material printers with partial control on material composition and properties , offering layered composite materials . 
Furthermore , multiple printing heads have allowed printing blended composites with functional and variable features . 
3D printing of fiber reinforced composites is currently conducted by stereolithography , laminated object manufacturing , fused deposition modeling , selective laser sintering , and extrusion . 
This is one of the hottest topics in the field of additive manufacturing and is under intense attention . 
This also offers significant improvement in mechanical properties , however , it requires a complex procedure to be manufactured and is difficult to be incorporated into processing . 
Implementing the traditional methods of composite manufacturing in AM is not practical and new technologies are needed to assist with the development of new AM methods . 
Advances in development of composite 3D printers have not prevented development in pre-blended materials with fillers such as nanoparticles , carbon nanotubes , fibers and graphene in order to achieve unique characteristics and capabilities . 
Fiber reinforcement , in particular , appears to be an attractive filler to improve the properties of polymers . 
Pre-blended materials using discontinuous fibers asan additive have been under intense investigation asa suitable alternative to multi-head printers with complex and costly designs . 
These additive based materials exhibit unique characteristics and capabilities , depending on the additive used . 
Suitable mechanical , electrical , or thermal properties can be accomplished in an inexpensive manner . 
Polymers , in particular , have been the center of attention due to ease of production and availability . 
The 3D printing industry primarily involves polymers in various forms , such as reactive , liquid solutions , and thermoplastic melts . 
These benefits , joined by enhancements from fiber reinforcement , offer a favorable combination for future development of AM technology . 
In addition , almost all of the existing AM methods can be benefited from fiber reinforcement . 
Although fiber reinforcement in 3D printing sounds promising , there are numerous issues which need to be resolved . 
Namely , the effect of fibers on resolution , agglomerate formation , heterogeneous composite formation , blockage of printer heads , non-adhesion , and increased curing times . 
This paper reviews recent advances in AM of polymer based fiber reinforced composites and potential methods for modelling and analysis of these 3D printed structures . 
Latest development and improvement to existing methods will be reviewed in detail , in order to understand the challenges in 3D printing of polymer composites with fiber reinforcement . 
3D printing of fiber reinforced polymer composites Fiber reinforcement can greatly improve the properties of 3D printed parts with polymer matrix . 
Fiber orientation and void content of composites are the main concerns in 3D printing of these composites . 
Most of the commercially available 3D printing techniques would benefit from fiber reinforcement . 
In this section , all of these techniques for 3D printing of polymer-fiber composites are reviewed in detail to demonstrate their strengths and weaknesses in additive manufacturing of polymer-fiber composites . 
These methods are FDM , LOM , SL , extrusion , and SLS . 
2.1 Fused deposition modeling FDM is currently the most applied AM technology , according to WohlerReport from Stratasys , Inc. Commercial FDM machines held 41.5 % of the market share , with the total of 15,000 FDM machines sold by the end of 2010 . 
The key elements of the FDM system include material feed mechanism , liquefier , print head , gantry , and build surface . 
Several process parameters are essential in FDM , including bead width , air gap , model build temperature , and raster orientation . 
The effects of raster orientation on tensile and compression test results have been investigated in detail . 
The temperature distribution during the FDM process can be monitored by IR camera . 
The surface roughness and cross section shape of the FDM fabricated parts are under intense study . 
1 and 2 illustrate the bonding mechanism in the FDM of polymer composites along cross-section of printed parts . 
Several building rules have been proposed to improve the strength and accuracy of the FDM printed parts , such as build parts to ensure tensile loads are carried axially along printed directions , deal with the stress concentration at corners , use negative air gap to increase both strength and stiffness , consider that small bead width leads to extra printing time and better surface quality , be aware the part accuracy affected by the build orientation , and realize that tensile loaded area tends to fail easier than compression loaded area . 
Recently , fiber reinforcement in FDM has been very popular amongst researchers . 
Most of the efforts have focused on development of filaments with short fiber additives . 
Inclusion of fibers in filament reduces tape swelling at the printing head during deposition and increases the stiffness . 
Glass fiber reinforced polypropylene was evaluated by Carneiro , Silva and showed 30 % and 40 % improvement for the modulus and strength , respectively , compared to pure PP . 
Vapor grown carbon fibers and single wall carbon nanotubes were compounded with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene for the FDM process . 
The VGCFs can be easily aligned by the extrusion process . 
Tensile strength of 5wt % of VGCFs and SWNTs filled FDM parts increased 18 % and 31 % , respectively . 
However , the strain to failure of printed parts reinforced with VGCFs and SWNTs was dramatically decreased . 
ABS containing oriented VGCFs and SWNTs exhibited modulus improvements up to 93 % . 
The fiber orientation can be observed in 3 . 
Thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers with excellent tensile strength , such as ABS and polypropylene , were used in fiber reinforced FDM parts in order to overcome the drawbacks of low aspect ratio of fiber in short fiber filled parts . 
Processing temperature was one of the important parameters which affects the surface morphology of TLCP and its mechanical behavior . 
Higher carbon fiber ratio has a high maximum decomposition temperature , thus providing high thermal stability . 
Ning , Cong evaluated the effect of weight ratio and length of carbon fiber on physical properties of the FDM samples with ABS matrix . 
The 5 and 7.5wt % carbon fiber content showed the best improvement in tensile strength and Young 's modulus , respectively . 
These researchers have also concluded that longer carbon fibers can increase tensile strength and Young 's modulus at the expense of toughness and ductility . 
As described in 4 , with aligned carbon fiber during the FDM process , 30wt % CF-ABS composites exhibited great improvement in strength and Youngmodulus . 
These printed CF-ABS parts exhibit specific strength higher than Aluminum . 
The triangular channels between beads decreased by incorporating carbon fibers due to the reduced die-swell and increased thermal conductivity . 
However , inclusion of carbon fiber into the feedstock caused internal voids inside of the beads responsible for stress concentration , resulting in failure at lower stresses . 
It can be seen in 5 that the FDM samples exhibited significant pore formation , with internal voids , as well as voids formed between the deposited beads during printing . 
Continuous fiber reinforcement is currently one of the biggest challenges researchers face in 3D printing of polymer composites . 
It offers significant improvement in mechanical properties compared to discontinuous fibers , however , there is still no robust and standard paradigm developed for 3D printing of continuous fiber composites . 
Recently , Matsuzaki , Ueda developed an innovative technique for in-nozzle impregnation of continuous fiber and thermoplastic matrix . 
The resin filament and fiber were supplied separately , before heating and mixing in the printing head . 
The schematic of this process demonstrating the printing head and continuous fiber integration is presented in 6 . 
Carbon fibers and twisted yarns of natural jute fibers were used as reinforcement . 
Superiority of continuous fiber composites versus short fiber reinforcement and other 3D printing methods can be observed in 7 . 
Namiki , Ueda implemented the same technique for printing polyactic acid /carbon fiber composite parts . 
Some gaps were reported between PLA filaments , which can be reduced by increasing the resolution . 
Tensile strength of continuous carbon fiber reinforced PLA prepared by FDM , as reported by Li , Li , can reach up to 91MPa , while in the case of short carbon fiber , it is only 68MPa . 
Weak bonding between PLA and carbon fiber can significantly affect the mechanical properties in this method , however , surface modification of carbon fiber bundle with methylene dichloride and PLA particles improved adhesion and increased tensile and flexural strength . 
8 presents the ultimate tensile and flexural strength of pure PLA , carbon fiber-PLA , and modified carbon fiber-PLA . 
Green circles in 8 indicate different phases of the tensile process , namely , loading of the PLA material between fixture and test sample at the beginning of the test and a slight drop of the curve slope due to fiber-matrix interface debonding . 
Marked circles in 8 signify the process of load change from resin to fiber at the beginning of the test . 
The next circle in 8 shows the plastic elongation of PLA polymer chains that continue to bear load after the failure of carbon fibers . 
Tian , Liu performed a systemic analysis on interface and performance of printed continuous carbon fiber reinforced PLA composites and the effect of process parameters on the temperature and pressure in the process . 
9 shows cross-section of the tensile bar and continuous fibers in the fracture surface , and 10 demonstrates the capability of this method in 3D printing large curvatures , without losing the continuous fiber reinforcement . 
Melenka , Cheung evaluated continuous Kevlar fiber-reinforced 3D printed Nylon structures using commercial desktop printers in order to predict the tensile properties . 
Stiffness and ultimate strength showed significant increase with high volume of fiber reinforcement . 
Carbon fibers were placed between layers of 3D printed polymer to improve strength and fatigue life , while thermal treatment was performed to further increase the mechanical properties . 
However , Van Der Klift , Koga showed that increasing the number of carbon fiber layers results in larger void areas , which had negative effect on the tensile strength . 
Impregnation of plastics into the fiber bundle could be achieved in the temperature range of 200Layer thickness of 0.4and hatch spacing of about 0.6mm guaranteed bonding strength between lines and layers . 
These parameters could achieve maximum flexural strength of 335MPa and flexural modulus of 30GPa . 
2.2 Laminated object manufacturing In LOM , which was developed by Helisys of Torrance , CA and shipped in 1991 , 3D parts are manufactured by cutting 2D cross-sections with a laser or cutter and sequentially laminating the sheets . 
Paper , metals , plastics , fabrics , synthetic materials , and composites are amongst the materials that can be utilized in LOM . 
Polymer matrix composites of C-shaped panels were directly fabricated by curved LOM . 
A vacuum thermoforming apparatus was applied to bond commercial prepregs . 
The shear strength of fabricated composites was measured to be approximately 24.8MPa , which was suggested by the authors to be acceptable for normal applications . 
The LOM process was applied to print 3D parts of unidirectional and continuous glass fibers with 52and epoxy matrix . 
The final part and its cross section are presented in 13 . 
Decent interfacial bonding was shown by interlayer microstructures of LOM polymer composites . 
The major issue for the LOM process was the incapability of the heat roller to bring parts to full consolidation and cure . 
It is helpful to increase the interface strength and reduce void contents to under 5 % by a post consolidation cycle . 
Sonmez and Hahn studied heat transfer and stress in LOM to understand the effect of process parameters on the resulting stress and temperature distributions . 
Large rollers were more favorable for bonding , due to a less concentrated stress distribution . 
Recently , a new method called laser assisted AM for continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic composites was developed by researchers at Kansas State University , with the motivation of reducing the waste associated with LOM . 
The authors proposed using prepreg tape instead of pre-cut prepreg sheet . 
The tape strips were placed layer by layer using a CO2 laser beam and consolidation roller , prior to laser cutting of each layer . 
14 demonstrates this process schematically , as well as its tensile properties in comparison with various AM and conventional methods of composite manufacturing . 
This method exhibits superior mechanical properties due to continuous fiber reinforcement , high fiber weight ratio , minimized void content , and superior interfacial bonding . 
2.3 Stereolithography The 3D parts fabricated by SL exhibit weak mechanical properties , which hinder their further applications as functional components under loading conditions . 
However , adding fibers to the resin can increase the potential of SL in 3D printing functional components . 
Although continuous fiber is ideal for reinforcement , high weight ratio of short fibers can yield comparable results , however , their efficiency is limited due to fracture during mixing , random orientation , and un-even length . 
Multi-wall carbon nanotubes with a low weight ratio were mixed in SL resin by mechanical mixing and ultrasonic dispersion . 
The tensile strength and fracture strength were increased by 5.7 % and 26 % , respectively , by adding 0.025wt % MWNTs . 
Carbon fiber has been successfully applied to reinforce polymers , however , the primary issue for utilizing carbon fiber in SL is that it is opaque to the UV light . 
Consequently , regions of the resin blocked by carbon fibers remains uncured by UV light . 
Using glass fiber instead of carbon fiber can be beneficial for decreasing the opacity to UV light . 
The SL plus vacuum cast process was investigated to improve the tensile strength . 
Tensile samples produced by SL and polymer-glass fiber nonwoven-polymer sandwich structures were introduced by vacuum cast , which showed a significant increase of 36 % in ultimate tensile strength and 11 % increase in stiffness . 
The viscosity of the resin , especially at low shear rates , increased in the composite resins with significant volume fractions of fibers . 
The surface coating of fibers can effectively reduce the viscosity , which is an advantage which allows processing of resins with higher fiber concentrations . 
Laser scanning based SL was used to add 20vol % of short glass fibers into an acrylic based photo polymer . 
15 shows the microstructures of molded and laser-scanned specimen with 20vol % glass fiber . 
Fiber filled composites represents a higher elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength . 
The shrinkage of fiber reinforced composites was also observed to be lower than their non-reinforced counterparts . 
Dual porlymerization scheme , including UV radiation and thermal treatments , was proposed to cure resins containing a high volume ratio of carbon fibers . 
It was estimated that one quarter of resin remains uncured , which was primarily inside of carbon fibers . 
After an hour of thermal treatment , the tensile strength was increased by 95 % . 
Llewellyn-Jones , Drinkwater used ultrasonic manipulation to distribute glass microfibers in the resin . 
A variety of fiber orientation angles were achieved , demonstrating the versatility of the process . 
This method allows smart material fabrication , such as resin-filled capsules for self-healing or piezoelectric particles for energy harvesting . 
2.4 Extrusion Extrusion , as one of the most recent developments in 3D printing , emerged to overcome the limitations of the FDM method with its versatility and cost-effectiveness . 
In this AM technique , layers of the material solution are directly deposited in a volatile solvent to produce freeform 3D structures . 
Lightweight cellular carbon fiber and SiC whiskers filled composites have been demonstrated by applying 3D extrusion printing method , as described in 16 . 
Epoxy-based inks , which exhibited the desired viscoelasticity and long pot-life in the absence and presence of highly anisotropic carbon fibers , were prepared . 
The SiC-filled and SiC/C filled transverse specimens showed a substantial increase in Youngmodulus , over the pure resin from 2.66 to 10.61 and 8.06 respectively . 
Tensile strength of printed composites was comparable to the cast epoxy resin samples , with longitudinal specimens exhibiting slightly higher strength than that the transverse specimens . 
17 shows a comparison in tensile strength of 3D printed tensile bars , using various fillers , as well as their microstructure . 
PLA/MWNTs composite was used to fabricate conductive 3D microstructures , with arbitrary shapes as small as 100with a method called liquid deposition modeling . 
2.5 Selective laser sintering SLS is a powder based AM process . 
The laser scans the powder bed , layer by layer , to form a 3D structure , as demonstrated in 18 . 
It mainly deals with wax , ceramics , metals and polymers . 
Major polymers used by SLS include nylon , i.e . 
polyamide , crystalline thermoplastics : polyethylene , PEEK , and PCL . 
SLS can be categorized in solid state sintering , liquid phase sintering-partial melting , full melting , and chemically induced binding . 
SSS is a thermal process that occurs at temperatures between TMelt /2 and TMelt , where TMelt is the melting temperature . 
In liquid phase sintering-partial melting , usually the binder material becomes liquefied , while structural material remains solid . 
The full melting technique melts the powder entirely and exhibits properties comparable to those of bulk material . 
It can be applied to a wide variety of materials , however , the long process time and preheating of powders is necessary . 
1 lists the range of materials and their associated binding mechanism in SLS . 
CNT was added in Polyamide 12 in order to improve the mechanical behaviors . 
The laser sintered parts had 13 % greater flexural modulus , 10.9 % higher flexural strength , and 54 % larger Youngmodulus . 
The crystallization temperature of PA12-CNT powder was increased , compared to the pure PA12 , which was responsible in hindering the movement of PA12 chains by the interfacial force between CNTs and PA12 . 
However , the porosity also increased in the CNT composites . 
MWNTs were also mixed with PA12 for the investigation of its effect on mechanical properties . 
Goodridge , Shofner also confirmed enhancement in mechanical properties of PA12 with inclusion of CNT , exhibiting 22 % increase in storage modulus . 
A high volume ratio of carbon fiber was added into PA12 . 
CNT-coated PA12 also improved heat conduction and heat absorption compared to pure PA12.. 
Furthermore , simulation results on laser sintering of PA12-CNT suggested that inclusion of CNT helps the laser heat to be conducted wider and deeper into the powder bed . 
The result of these simulations can be observed in 19 . 
Uniform distribution of carbon fibers and good interfacial adhesion between fibers and matrix was achieved by pre-modification of carbon fibers through oxidation . 
By adding the maximum weight ratio of carbon fibers , the flexural strength and flexural modulus were enhanced 114 % and 243.4 % , respectively . 
Glass beads were used asadditives in SLS of Nylon powders , in order to determine the mechanical properties , as a function of material composition . 
Zhu , Yan proposed a novel method to prepare high-performance carbon fibers/PA12/epoxy ternary composites by infiltrating the porous green carbon fibers/PA12 parts built by SLS , with high-performance thermosetting epoxy resin , prior to curing the resin ; this process is described in 20 . 
The end result is a ternary composite system with novolac epoxy resin , reinforced with carbon fibers coated with a thin 595nm layer of PA12 . 
This method with 33 % volume fraction of carbon fibers yielded an ultimate tensile strength of 101.03MPa and a flexural strength of 153.43MPa . 
3 Four-Dimensional printing of active Polymer-Fiber composites Addition of fiber in 3D printed polymers is not always for improving the mechanical properties . 
Fibers , as well other additives , are also used in manufacturing of smart composites , to control the structure transformation . 
This implementation in 3D printing opened a new field called 4D printing . 
4D printing refers to a multi-material printing with the ability to transform over time or change its shape after the printing . 
These structures can be programmable and transformed from one or two dimensional structures to 3D objects . 
Recent advances in AM made precise placement of material at micro-scale during 3D printing of complex structures possible . 
This allows implementing programmable and computational material in AM in order to control the shape of the material after printing . 
These materials can change their shape under light , temperature change , or immersion into a solvent . 
3D printing technology has enabled active material to achieve an even higher complexity and accuracy . 
Fiber additives play an important role in 4D printing ; controlling the fiber alignment allows programmable transformation , right out of the printing bed . 
Ge , Qi developed a method to print thermomechanically programmable composites with complex shapes . 
The matrix and fibers used were an elastomer and a glassy polymer , with tailored thermomechanical behavior , respectively . 
21 demonstrates the process in which the inkjet deposited material on the bed , prior to photopolymerization of the film by UV light , forms a layer . 
Gladman , Matsumoto printed plant-inspired architectures , with a hydrogel composite ink , composed of stiff cellulose fibrils embedded in a soft acrylamide matrix . 
Alignment of cellulose fibrils controlled the swelling of the 3D printed part upon immersion in water . 
These structures are programmable based on the printing direction and orientation of embedded cellulose fibrils inside the structure . 
4 Modeling and analytical techniques Polymer-fiber composites produced by AM can be analyzed using existing theories based on the manufacturing technique and the reinforcement type . 
Existing macro and micro mechanical modelling techniques can be applied to AM with slight modifications . 
Microstructure of 3D printed parts often differ from those prepared by traditional manufacturing methods and with the immerging of new AM methods , there is a demand for modelling and analysis of these structures . 
4.1 Short fiber composite theories There are several theories for predicting the properties of short fiber composites . 
Depending on their assumptions , they can be applied to various 3D printing methods . 
Fibers alignment , shape , length , and its bonding with the matrix are crucial in accuracy of the modelling . 
The modified rule of mixtures is the simplest method to predict the tensile properties of short fiber composites , by assuming perfect fiberinterfacial bonding . 
MROM is given by cu = 1 2 V f fu + V m m where 1 2 is fiber efficiency factor for the strength of the composite , in which , 1 and 2 are the fiber orientation and fiber length factors , respectively ; cu and fu are ultimate strength of the composite and fiber , respectively ; V f and V m represent the volume fraction of the fiber and matrix ; and m is the matrix stress at the composite failure . 
If the fiber length is equal to L and uniform , fiber orientation factor is equal to 1 and fiber length factor is given by the critical fiber length , r f is fiber radius , and i is interfacial shear stress between matrix and fibers . 
In order to consider the effect of fiber orientation and non-uniform fiber length in the model , 1 and 2 should be modified . 
Modified Kelly and Tyson model proposed for fibers shorter and longer than the critical fiber length with considering fiber orientation , as follows . 
However , fiber orientation factor 1 in this model is fitted empirically . 
Fu and Lauke used two probability density functions for modelling the fiber length and fiber orientation distributions with the intention of predicting the elastic properties . 
There are various theories for predicting the stiffness properties of short-fiber composites . 
The Morimodel is another well-known theory that considers a non-dilute composite containing many identical spheroidal particles . 
It is assumed that the composite experiences an average stress different from that of the applied stress . 
Longitudinal and transverse elastic moduli in Morimodel are where V f is the volume fraction of filler and m is the Poissonratio of the matrix ; A1 , A2 , A3 , A4 , A5 , and A are functions of the Eshelbytensor and the properties of the fiber and the matrix , with more explanation given in . 
In theory , the aforementioned equations for short fiber composites , can be used to model 3D printed parts , however , length and orientation of the fibers used in the process should match the assumptions . 
FDM , SLS , and extrusion with short fiber reinforcement can be modeled with these analytical methods . 
However , 3D printed parts often contain considerable fraction of void content and modifications may be necessary when applying these methods on additive manufacturing . 
Void in composite materials are comprehensively explained in . 
4.2 Classical laminate plate theory CLPT is an extension of the classical plate theory for isotropic and homogeneous materials with some modifications to reflect the inhomogeneity of orthotropic materials in thickness direction . 
CLTP is applicable to all 3D printed parts that exhibit orthogonal behavior . 
Here , we present a brief summary of CLPT for laminated plates consisting of multiple unidirectional laminae . 
The stiffness matrix of each ply can be described as . 
Transformed reduced stiffness matrix for various fiber orientation can be computed using transformation matrix as follow , and is the angle of the fiber reinforcement . 
Then , in-plane , coupling , and bending stiffness matrices can be obtained by , respectively where z represents the vertical position in the ply from the midplane . 
Finally , we can write a connection between the applied loads and the associated strains in the laminate , as follows , N M = A B B D 0 where N is normal stress resultants , M is moment resultants , 0 represent strain term in midplane , and is the twist of the laminated plate . 
The strain along the plate thickness can be given by , x y xy = x 0 y 0 xy 0 + z x y xy Additionally , by using the same principle , CLPT can be applied to evaluate the strength and elastic constants of FDM printed parts with void content . 
As mentioned earlier , FDM process is associated with void formation between printing beads , which needs to be considered in the modeling . 
In the method developed by Rodriguez , Thomas for ABS materials , The FDM part is defined as an unidirectional ABScomposite with a laminate structure . 
This structure is consisting of vertically stacked layers with contiguous material and voids . 
The unidirectional elastic constants are given as and represent the elastic modulus , shear modulus and Poissonratio of the extruded polymer used in the FDM process . 
The 1 is the area void density in the plane normal to filament direction . 
This method was used in various works for single material FDM parts containing void , however , certain modifications are needed in order to apply it to multi-material 3D printing . 
More information regarding void in composite structures can be found in . 
4.3 Finite element method FEM is particularly interesting for modelling 3D printed part due to its flexibility in analyzing complex geometries in both macro and micro scale . 
It can be applied to continuous and short fiber 3D printed composites . 
The primary distinction of most composites by AM is the significant void content that needs to be incorporated into the respective finite element model . 
Perhaps the most appealing approaches for mechanical modelling of fiber composites are homogenization , which was described briefly in CLPT , and unit-cell based methods . 
Both approaches can be implemented in FEM , thus , applicable to all AM methods . 
Conversely , there has been a lack of attention to modelling of these processes , and with increasing the popularity of 3D printing among practitioners , the need for simulation of the 3D printing process is certain . 
UC is a single or multiple fibers embedded in the matrix with the volume fraction similar to those of the composite . 
A finite element model of this geometry using two different materials is constructed and various loadings are applied to characterize the behavior of the UC . 
In the case of composites with random fiber orientations the composite behavior is approximated by direct averaging over all orientations . 
Unit cells depend upon the microstructure of the composite ; some common types of unite cell are presented in 24 . 
24 presents a UC for discontinuous short fiber composites with random orientations , 24 and shows UC for continuous fiber reinforced with unidirectional orientation and 3D braided structure , respectively . 
Another commonly used approach is multiscale methods by combining micro level and homogenized macro stress analysis . 
Microscopic level analysis can increase the accuracy , but are often too expensive to be used in practice . 
Multiscale modelling takes advantage of the efficiency of macroscopic models and the accuracy of the microscopic models . 
The microscope analysis is normally performed at the area of interest with high stress concentration . 
25 shows a multiscale simulation with microscale analysis performed on two different areas of interest and macroscale analysis in the entire domain . 
5 Conclusions 3D printing of composite structures can be a turning point for AM technology . 
The potential of fabricating functional devices , directly from commercial 3D printers with controllable properties , created a huge rush for new developments and research in this field . 
The attractive combination of endless possibilities in the range of composite materials and extra customization of AM offers a unique new area in the manufacturing field , for researchers and developers to explore . 
AM of composites enables precise control of the physical , electrochemical , thermal , and optical properties ; these structures can even transform their shape over time in 4D printing . 
Fiber reinforcement significantly improves the mechanical properties of 3D printed parts . 
It can be implemented in various AM techniques , such as FDM , SLA , SLS , LOM , and extrusion . 
Printed CF-ABS composites were even reported with higher specific strength than Aluminum . 
The alignment of fibers in 3D printing of composites was one of the major challenges in the reviewed literature and its improvement attracted tremendous research interest in almost all of the existing AM methods . 
Recent advances in FDM printing of continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastics took these improvements one step further to establish AM as a dependable manufacturing method for various industries . 
In one of the interesting and innovative developments , continuous carbon fiber and PLA were mixed in the printing head before depositing into the printing bed , increasing the fiber/matrix adhesion . 
Laser assisted AM for continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic composites demonstrates superior mechanical properties and at the mean time solves the issue of material waste for LOM . 
Furthermore , developments in 3D printing of fiber reinforced composite structures allowed precise placement of material at micro-scale , to fabricate complex structures in 4D printing of active composites , with ability to transform over time , right after the 3D printing . 
However , most 3D printing methodologies for composite materials still face major challenges , which need to be overcome before becoming a mainstream manufacturing method . 
Void formation during printing , poor adhesion of fibers and polymer matrix , and challenges in continuous fiber printing are all amongst the existing issues in 3D printing of fiber composites . 
Moreover , most of the commercial 3D printers designed for specific resins and introduction of fillers can lead to blockage , wear , non-adhesion , and increased curing times . 
AM of composites is a relatively new technique and there is a lack of research on modelling the structures produced by this process . 
Existing theories for short and continuous fiber composites can be modified for 3D printed parts . 
On the other hand , FEM is a powerful tool to analyze composite structures , and it can be applied for 3D printing with slight modifications of existing finite element models . 
In conclusion , AM of fiber reinforced polymer composites is tremendously promising in turning 3D printing from a prototyping method to a robust manufacturing technique . 
The unique characteristics of 3D printing , such as high customization , combined with extra strength from fiber reinforcement and the ability to produce functional complex 3D structures with total control over material properties , helped AM of fiber-polymer composites gain enormous attention from a broad range of science industries . 
The aerospace industry , automotive industry , biomedical science , electronic industries , and robotics are only a few examples of those attracted by AM of fiber reinforced polymer composites . 
As the application of additive manufacturing reaches an unprecedented scale in both academia and industry , a reflection upon the state-of-the-art developments in the design for additive manufacturing and structural optimisation , becomes vital for successfully shaping the future AM-landscape . 
A framework , highlighting both the interdependencies between these two central aspects in AM and the necessity for a holistic approach to structural optimization , using lightweight strategies such as topology optimization and/or latticing , was established to summarize the reviewed content . 
Primarily focusing on isotropic material considerations and basic stiffness-optimal problems , these concepts have already found wide application , bridging the gaps between design and manufacturing as well as academia and industry . 
In pursuit of streamlining the AM-workflow towards digitally print-ready designs , studies are increasingly investigating mathematically-based structural optimization approaches in conjunction with DfAM-specific constraints , providing a portfolio of solutions like generative design , which is gaining traction in industry . 
Besides an overview on economically-driven to performance-driven design optimizations , insight into commercial AM-specific software is provided , elucidating potentials and challenges for the community . 
Graphical abstract Unlabelled Image Highlights Extensive review , providing a joint perspective on design and structural optimisation in additive manufacturing . 
Overview on the lightweighting approaches topology optimization and latticing , considering isotropic material assumptions . 
Consolidated summary , elucidating the gaps between design and manufacturing as well as academia and industry . 
Establishment of a design for AM framework , highlighting the interdependencies between state-of-the art research topics . 
Additive manufacturing , also referred to as 3D-printing , has evolved greatly over the last three decades , emerging from the mere application in prototyping , it has now indisputably established its position as a viable fabrication alternative for end-use parts . 
This applies to a wide range of industries , including medical engineering , automotive , aerospace and consumer products , . 
lower energy consumption , has driven the research into identifying lightweight and robust designs . 
Topology optimisation and latticing have emerged as the two major lightweighting strategies , best exploiting the design freedoms offered by AM . 
The former represents a rigorous approach , improving the specific stiffness , whereas the latter can be considered as a design approach for weight-reduction in parts that usually have a high safety factor , which has in fact been widely adopted as a common design practice in today 's AM-specific software . 
multifunctionality and bio-inspired designs , are gaining interest and could help shape the future of structurally advanced AM-parts . 
This development is supported by the steady improvements in printer hardware and AM-specific software as well as the enrichment of the available material palette . 
In fact , AM is attributed a central role in the successful realization of the new industrial revolution , i.e . 
Industry 4.0 , affecting both the way we design and fabricate . 
This is clearly reflected by the prediction of a threefold increase in the industry 's market value as stated in the Wohlers report . 
Jiang envisage among others intensified manufacturing of both critical and non-critical spare parts as well as increased customization of products with AM , which will require improvements in the structural performance and adequate design practices , respectively . 
From a design and structural standpoint , reviews in AM have so far focused on either the development of design rules and frameworks in the context of DfAM or the role of e.g . 
TO , latticing , processing parameters , materials and bio-inspired approaches , respectively . 
Herein , a joint scope including a much wider consideration for DfAM in structural optimization for AM is captured , reviewing two key lightweighting strategies in AM , namely TO and latticing and providing insight into the academic versus the commercial landscape . 
1 introduces a framework , relating key intrinsic and extrinsic DfAM aspects that were identified in the field of design and structural optimisation for AM . 
An intrinsic aspect is , therefore , representing the primary drivers when designing for AM , whereas the extrinsic factors can be regarded as current research topics in design and structural optimization for AM . 
The remit of this paper , however , goes beyond this framework , highlighting the underlying dependencies between the individual extrinsic factors in the state-of-the-art research today . 
Three interrelated themes referred to as entail process- and material-induced aspects , lightweighting strategies as well as broader DfAM-factors and are arranged analogously to the chronological order of headings in this paper . 
This review focuses on structural optimisation in AM with particular emphasis on DfAM . 
As most works on lightweighting strategies are based on isotropic material assumptions , reinforced-materials and the process-induced anisotropy caused by the fabrication in a layer-by-layer fashion or infill pattern , are not assessed . 
As the role of anisotropy for topology optimisation in AM was discussed in , elucidating that this research is still in its infancy and requiring more fundamental investigations for a critical review , this paper summarizes the more consolidated knowledge in this field . 
A DfAM framework , encapsulating intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of the cutting-edge research on AM-friendly structural optimisation , preludes the main part of this work and provides context and structure to the reviewed studies . 
The joint focus on structural optimisation in AM using TO and latticing with incorporation of DfAM aspects constitutes the remit of this paper . 
Secondly , the synergistic and expertise-dominated application of cellular structures , as design approach to lightweighting , will be addressed . 
Hereby , focus is put on their application and significance in standard engineering problems rather than the medical field , as reviewed elsewhere . 
Moreover , it is important to note that the reviewed works are primarily looking into basic structural problems , concentrating on improved stiffness under volume constraints . 
2 Structural optimisation with isotropic material in AM The role of structural optimisation in AM is increasing across industries with lightweighting strategies that can broadly be differentiated into mathematically-driven and expertise-driven , with recent studies seeing increased utilization of both . 
Here , TO is frequently adopted for the design of structurally-sound AM-parts and has meanwhile surpassed the use of shape and size optimization in isolation . 
However , it has become a general practice in commercial software to post-process TO-solutions by optimizing the size or shape of the final structure to adhere e.g . 
to minimum feature sizes that match the resolution of the printer . 
In contrast , expertise-driven structural optimisation such as latticing is not a lightweighting strategy per se , as stiffness is greatly compromised in exchange for e.g . 
A good example of this is the latticing of a part for weight reductions and enhanced functionality in areas where stiffness can be sacrificed . 
Generative design formally merges these two schemes through a parallel implementation to provide a portfolio of solutions i.e . 
1 Topology optimisation in AM Bendsand Kikuchi 's as well as Sigmund 's landmark work , introducing the concept of shape and TO centred on the homogenization approach and the MATLAB implementation of a density-based TO , respectively , laid the foundation for today 's TO-methods . 
The most prominent TO approaches can be summarized as follows : Density-based ; Level Set ; Evolutionary/Genetic Algorithms ; Topological Derivatives and Phase Field . 
Discrete TO can be described as a method that explores the optimal connection of the elements , whereas continuum TO determines the optimal spatial distribution of material within a domain . 
At the core of each structural TO problem lies an objective function that needs to be minimized or maximized while being subjected to a set of constraints such as volume , displacement or frequency . 
As part of an iterative process , in methods utilizing density as a design variable , Finite Element Analysis , sensitivity analysis , regularizations and optimisation steps are repeated in this order until convergence is achieved . 
In the context of DfAM , research today is geared towards print-ready TO designs bridging challenges of design and fabrication . 
This refers to methods that change the numerically optimal solution either intrinsically through the imposition of manufacturing constraints or in subsequent post-processing steps which alter the geometrical layout . 
Support-free designs and strategies to reduce the support volume are facilitators for a time- and cost-efficient fabrication . 
In pursuit of both physically and digitally print-ready designs , smooth boundary representations have drawn great attention in recent years . 
In this review , this refers to mesh-refinements , ensuring a better surface representation or CAD-friendly geometries . 
In this context , correct digitalizing of TO-solutions will be pivotal for future CAD/CAM software , including an automated design procedure that integrates DfAM considerations and requires less AM-expertise . 
Emerging TO methods with DfAM consideration for smooth boundary representation include the Development Method and the Morphable Method . 
Herein , basic geometric shapes and polygons , capturing the geometrical layouts , have served as simple design primitives for representing topologies . 
1 SIMP-based designs for AM Density-based TO methods are most prevalent in academia and follow the general procedure . 
A well-established continuum method often referred to as the SIMP approach , first introduced by Bends , relates the elements relative densities to the effective material moduli using the power law . 
As most works use linear elastic assumptions with the standard density-based TO approaches , they lack the ability to solve problems with large deformations accurately . 
However , regarding DfAM , designs with elastoplastic print consumables , as commonly used , could particularly benefit from more realistic material considerations . 
Major findings in studies on non-linear TO include : 1 ) the difference between linear and non-linear modelling of large deformations is particularly evident in buckling and snap-through scenarios ; 2 ) a non-linear analysis made insignificant changes to the stiffness/compliance of a linear elastic structure but altered the topology significantly ; 3 ) non-linearity assumptions are beneficial for realizing compliant mechanisms ; 4 ) issues with excessive distortions or convergence of the numerical model can be solved . 
1 Academic approaches to structurally optimized AM-friendly parts With the maturation of TO-codes in recent years towards greater computational efficiency and complexity , the inclusion of DfAM aspects is on the rise . 
Most of today 's research on TO for AM is economically-driven and deals with support volume reduction , their complete elimination or simplified removal . 
Support-free structures with reasonably good quality can generally be expected for an inclination angle in the realm of 45 , which has been widely adopted for structural optimization problems anything lower is associated with additional fabrication cost motivating efforts in achieving conformity between design and print . 
However , it should be noted that fine-tuning of process parameters in polymer FDM has shown to allow even lower print-angles . 
Performance is inevitably compromised by imposing manufacturing constraints but opposed to accounting for support volume , performance-driven factors in TO methods , including e.g . 
In , the performance and printability of a structure derived from a coupled truss and SIMP-based optimisation approach were investigated . 
By projecting a truss framework onto the corresponding TO-solution , the material was re-distributed , promoting adherence to overhang angle limits . 
As a result , a topology that does require less support but has reasonably high performance was created . 
Additionally , it was found that the printing direction is a key control parameter between manufacturability and performance . 
An efficient DfAM filter for TO , avoiding support structures , has also been the subject of research in the works of Langelaar , in which a projection method was proposed for 2D and 3D cases . 
More recently , Langelaar has extended this AM-filter approach to a method for optimizing topology , support layout and build orientation simultaneously , providing designers and engineers with a portfolio of results with the corresponding fabrication cost and part performance . 
The support-filter itself is based on the premise of a layer-wise AM fabrication , whereby it is examined whether the base elements in the underlying layer offer support considering the critical support-free inclination angle of 45Together with a sensitivity filter based on the adjoint method , the AM-filter formulation is integrated into the code of Andreassen , making it an easily accessible tool for print-ready AM-parts with improved structural performance . 
Numerical examples provided in illustrated the printability of TO-structures as a function of printing orientation . 
a half MBB beam , Langelaar highlighted not only the effectiveness of the filter to avoid shallow angles and its effect on the final topology compared to the unconstrained model , but also the variation in compliance with the building orientation . 
An extension of this method could potentially be promising for multidirectional slicing in robotic AM . 
Gaynor and co-workers as well as Qian , showed that the Heaviside Projection offered an alternative means to constraining the overhang angles in TO-solutions . 
In this scheme was employed to enforce a binary solution from the greyscale SIMP-solution by controlling the minimum radial length scale . 
determine the minimum self-supporting angle in 2D . 
Gaynor and Guest found major changes in the topology and deterioration in performance with increasing self-supporting angles . 
In the Heaviside Projection was employed both on the density and the density gradient to obtain well-defined boundaries and constrain the perimeter length in undercuts and overhangs for 3D cases . 
improved convergence to a discrete solution . 
As an example , a cantilever beam was optimized for individual minimum overhang angles , illustrating that overhang angle and gradient constraint need to be concurrently changed and that the compliance is significantly increased over the unconstrained pendant , especially for increased overhang angles . 
Leary proposed an approach in which infeasible inclination angles are initially identified , followed by a layout transmission into a support-free design and the determination of the optimal building orientation . 
Firstly , a binary topology was obtained through thresholding of the gradient values to identify the perimeters and its local gradients . 
Subsequently , smoothing of the boundary was performed using the rolling average method . 
The actual novelties are the iterative internal and external boundary modifications centred on a recursive subdivision of domains to ensure the final design complies with the allowable inclination angle . 
The change in the geometrical layout increased the volume fraction of the part , however , due to the avoidance of support , experimental results showed a reduction in fabrication time . 
Benchmarking against standard TO result , numerical analyses showcased : a ) different stress distributions while the maximum von Mises stress stayed constant and b ) the heat transfer is increased , which is of particular interest for e.g . 
metal-AM , as entrapment of excessive temperature , leads to microstructural changes over time as shown by . 
It is important to note , however , that a weight increase is associated with this method , which should be carefully weighed against the material savings achieved by avoiding the supports or the ease in manufacturing . 
In contrast , a more recent paper by Thore investigates the abovementioned factor of stresses in support-free TO-solutions , while adhering to the volume constraint , linking economy and fabrication . 
Contrary to the above works , digitally print-ready designs , accounting for research that highlight efforts to facilitate the transition between design and print such as methods that require minimal post-processing to be manufacture-ready are gaining interest . 
Interpreting density-based TO solutions , even when they are discrete , poses a bottleneck for post-processes such as shape optimisation or the use of CAD programs for the conversion into AM-compatible file formats . 
A smooth boundary representation is , therefore , an aspect of particular attention in the context of TO . 
An approach which is post-processing the layout of a TO-solution was recently presented by Liu . 
Here , a multi-step transformation method from a greyscale SIMP-based solution into STL and IGES formats has been presented . 
It is comprised of : 1 ) density thresholding and mesh refinement ; 2 ) skeletonisation ; 3 ) identify small features and increase their elemental density ; 4 ) density filtering ; 5 ) density thresholding while preserving volume fraction ; 6 ) create STL file utilizing ; 7 ) boundary interpretation using spline fitting ; 8 ) obtain IGES file from an in-build MATLAB function . 
Shape optimisations procedures using a CAD model were shown to be suitable with designs obtained from the adaptive boundary fitting method due to its smooth boundaries . 
Studies like this represent a key element in today 's research from DfAM , namely the transformation of complex AM-designs into CAD/CAM environments . 
2 Commercial software implementations for lightweight structures Promoted by the greater application of TO in industry , an increased range of software providers have emerged , maturing and facilitating access to ready-to-use tools . 
Particularly TO software providing greater freedom in utilizing subroutines , as recently demonstrated in , present a promising platform for further innovations in this field . 
on automotive components like an upright . 
In , significant weight savings of one to two-thirds were achieved while ensuring the same structural performance as the original parts . 
In , shape controls ensured control over the member size , accounting for the minimum resolution of the electron beam melting process for a successful print . 
It was observed , that all considered factors were closely related to the amount of support material used , as it increased the fabrication time and cost . 
From the above study , it can be concluded that the layout of the final design for the industrial sector will be the result of multi-objective considerations , specifically drawing attention to the performance-economy relation with the utilized print materials . 
This highlights the importance of a DfAM framework that assures correct weighting of the relevant parameters and provides similar to the generative design a portfolio of quantifiable geometrical solutions . 
The optimisation of a heat sink design displayed the software 's capabilities to deal with multi-objective optimisation , as the design variables included friction force , thermal conductivity and out-of-plane heat transfer , besides the density of the elements . 
Despite showcasing the theoretical capabilities of today 's TO-software , the above-mentioned studies commonly lack experimental verification . 
Generally , numerical examples in TO involve either cantilever , half MBB or full MBB beams , but there is no explicit agreement by the scientific community on their aspect ratio , making comparisons difficult . 
From a practical standpoint , standardised flexure tests would be better suited for experimental verification and therefore aid the comparison between both the TO-models and their physical counterparts . 
3 Advanced applications TO-designs are increasingly adopted in technologically advanced industries as AM hardware and software are maturing , making complexity and scalability of AM-parts more tangible . 
Recent case-studies on topologically optimized engine pistons or car chassis indeed showed a promising development for increased uptake of TO in the automotive sector . 
As an example , Aage looked into optimizing the wing structure of a Boeing 777 using high-performance computing to overcome current limitations regarding the number of resolvable voxels and representable feature size . 
However , this should not distract from the more pressing challenge the AM-community is currently faced to further exploit AM capabilities , namely the reduction of the computational cost and improvement of the resolution for standard engineering problems . 
In case of small- and mid-sized companies these are commonly solved with standard desktop machines rather than employing high-performance computing . 
the fruition of compliant mechanisms , realized by means of multi-material printers and the use of materials with greatly varying Poisson 's ratios . 
2 AM-designs derived from evolutionary TO Evolutionary algorithms have been used and constantly improved for structural optimisation over the last two decades . 
The most prominent representative is BESO , introduced by Yang as an extension to the Evolutionary Structural Optimisation method put forward by Xie and Stevens . 
However , issues related to stepped contours i.e . 
smooth boundaries remain . 
1 Digitally print-ready designs In light of DfAM , achieving a smooth boundary representation , especially for discrete TO-solutions , is currently a subject of intense study . 
Capitalizing on the shape functions , a smoother boundary , accounting for discontinuous material distributions within single FEs , was realized . 
Despite revealing the same overall topology , the Iso-XFEM method provided a superior structural stiffness as compared to the BESO implementation for the same amount of iterations and identical mesh-size . 
BESO with a finer initial fixed mesh matched the performance but at a computational expense . 
As the mesh manipulation is outweighing the computational benefit of BESO , the AM-friendly Iso-XFEM method was regarded as the preferential TO method , streamlining the design process towards digitally-print-ready models and effectively tying in aspects of lightweighting and boundary representation . 
In a more recent study , Iso-XFEM was applied as a design-procedure to obtain a lightweight brake pedal . 
The structure was effectively enhanced for AM , using a manual post-processing step , in which a partial cellular infill based on Body Centred Cubic unit cells was included to improve the performance under arbitrary loading and to reduce warpage arising from residual stresses in SLM . 
In , a modified BESO method was used to optimize the strut thickness of lattices used in an engine bracket , to improve the compliance over a homogenous design . 
The material allocation is conducted based on the ratio between the local and global stress magnitude i.e . 
the stress distribution as well as the predefined strut diameter bounds . 
compliant mechanisms , a modified BESO with local displacement constraints was employed by Zuo and Xie . 
Here , the standard penalization factor was introduced for the material interpolation and to ensure convergence , however , for the FEA several critical nodes were assigned to local displacement functions based on the individual virtual loads to fine-tune the topology for a specific load case . 
Numerical examples displayed dissimilar topologies compared to the conventional compliance-driven approach and a significant reduction in the maximum vertical deflection . 
As outlined by the authors , this method lends itself for lightweight structures such as an aircraft wing , for which awareness and control over the deformed shape are required . 
For the most part , TO procedures employ fixed meshes for the FEA . 
A mesh refinement captures the material behaviour more accurately , however at higher computational cost due to more degrees of freedom . 
A fine mesh for updating design variable and a hierarchical system for the FEA . 
This resulted in a relatively-smooth topology , due to the finer resolution representing the boundaries of the structure , whereas the size of the internal elements remained coarse . 
It is of note that caution must be taken in choosing an appropriate value for the maximum element size to obtain accurate FEA results . 
3 Level set TO for AM Level set method centre around the structural boundaries i.e . 
interfaces and their implicit representation via iso-contours of the corresponding level set function . 
The inherently smooth and well-defined boundaries obtained lend themselves for parameterization into geometric shapes , potentially linking aspects of manufacturing and digitalization . 
However , for analysis , the geometrical model is mostly discretized and mapped onto a fixed mesh , following the density-based methods . 
For instance , by embracing both economic and performance-driven DfAM considerations , Liu and co-workers have developed a feature-based approach as well as algorithms that take into account the deposition path/building direction and support-free manufacturing . 
Regarding DfAM studies have shown that gaps between paths due to sharp angle changes can be avoided and as the paths follow the principal stress trajectories , the overall performance can be increased . 
In , the contour offset method and the structural skeleton based method , including a support structure constraint , were investigated . 
It was found that the structural performance was comparable between both methods , whereas , the skeleton-based method was favourable as it avoided manufacturing irregularities . 
The authors optimized a cantilever beam for self-supported AM , using a multi-LS interpolation approach , to illustrate their method . 
Similarly , the skeletonisation of 2D LS topologies was utilized in to constrain the minimum hole size and control the number of holes in the topology to ensure better manufacturability . 
In , it was applied to avoid small struts by controlling the minimum or maximum length scale of the features i.e . 
the distance between skeleton and boundary . 
8b illustrates the difference in topology between constraint and unconstraint LS TO of a cantilever beam . 
In the study of Allaire , the aspect of the overhang constraint was considered from two perspectives . 
The latter has been developed in and centres on the intermediate AM stages , resulting in the continuous change in shape and boundary conditions with each consecutive layer . 
the cooling rate as another fabrication constraint for this minimum compliance problem . 
Likewise , in , Mart accounted for process-induced effects , such as porosity in parts created from electron beam melting . 
Considering fabrication-stages and -flaws for different AM-processes is certainly representing a more interconnected and realistic application of DfAM , encompassing intrinsic and extrinsic factors , shared in the upper and middle band , and contributing to higher quality AM-parts in the future . 
Certain design requirements like fixed passive elements or other functional affiliations often do not allow support-free angles . 
Mirzendehdel and Suresh reduced the support volume of topologically optimized structures using an LS based Pareto TO , considering both support structure and topological sensitivities through dynamic weighting . 
Similar attempts to reduce support volume include tree-like and topologically optimized supports . 
2 Cellular structures in AM Cellular structures represent an important structural design feature in AM , commonly used for lightweighting . 
Characterized by slender/thin members , such as struts/bars or sheets/plates , these formations are increasingly utilized as an integral feature in AM-designs primarily due to material and time-/energy-saving in fabrication as well as improvements in strength-to-weight ratio , as summarized in . 
Besides the specific strength , their ability to dissipate energy , heat and vibration add value to the design . 
Recently , a significant increase in buckling load and buckling strength have been recorded by using triangular lattice-infills or topology optimized hierarchical microstructures , respectively . 
In metal-AM , they can also help mitigate warpage , arising from process-induced residual stresses , however , some lattice types must be altered to accommodate for e.g . 
The use of lattices , contrary to the common misconception , is therefore not a lightweighting approach from a pure stiffness standpoint , which needs to be considered in the design process . 
An overview from design to analysis of cellular structures for AM can be extracted from . 
Unit cells represent the building blocks of a lattice , which is generated either from sweeping , meshing/mapping , tessellation to obtain a regular pattern or stochastically yielding unstructured formations , which is often achieved via techniques such as dithering . 
Unit cells are generally classified into truss based and surface-based . 
Numerous cell topologies were generatively developed over the years , leading to the emergence of unit cell libraries/families for AM . 
Ground trusses , often resembling lattice-like configurations , are characterized by a freeform frame-network with locally varying strut diameters which also lends themselves well for AM . 
It is however of note , that isotropic open-cell truss-like structures have an up to threefold inferior stiffness performance compared to their closed-cell lattice counterparts of the same relative density . 
On this account , considering that lattices are not stiffness-optimal and given the choice , surface-based unit cells should be favoured for lightweight designs . 
Unit cell tessellation approaches often give rise to non-conformity as loose-hanging members are formed when a lattice is created , impairing the structural performance . 
Lattices derived from tessellated surface-based unit cells are less affected by this phenomenon . 
On the contrary , conformal lattices were found to yield greater structural performance . 
Works on graded lattices most generally focus on piecewise variation in volume fractions that change from one unit cell to another . 
However , due to the implicit definition of triply periodic minimal surface lattices , true functional grading is achievable with ease . 
Together with the advancement in hardware technology , capable of fine- and multi-scale structures , these new lightweight lattice structures with locally changing material properties represent a unique offering of AM . 
Discrepancies between the ideal and the actual performance of lattices , reviewed in , is owed to irregularities introduced during manufacturing , which include micro-voids or the change in surface roughness , making the prediction of the mechanical performance based on the relative density and linear elastic assumptions difficult . 
A comparison between the experimental and numerical analyses of lattices and a summary of simulation methods are summarized in . 
Latticing tools are increasingly provided in today 's CAD software and are commonly used to substitute low-stress areas for weight reduction . 
Particularly the ability to achieve a balance between robustness and compliance in tailored lattices was recently stressed . 
Another emerging research field in AM , aiming - among others - at combing high strength and stiffness , is biomimicry . 
Moreover , it is of note , that some software providers like ELiSE are already incorporating bionic templates into designs geared towards AM . 
1 Topologically optimized lattices based on academic codes Promising academic approaches dealing with structural optimisation of lattices for AM are on the uprise . 
The digitalisation of these intricate structures is a prerequisite to ensure optimisation , bridge the gap to manufacturing and ultimately improve the structural performance of lightweight AM-parts . 
Computationally efficient representation of lattices is as challenging as it is important for the analysis and manufacturing steps . 
As a consequence , research is actively looking into ways to reduce the computational expense , aiding streamline the design process and enabling geometrical layouts , such as functionally graded lattices . 
1 Structurally optimized lattices using the homogenization method To capture the heterogeneous nature of lattices , unit cells are commonly homogenized into representative volume elements . 
Homogenization-based methods have recently been integrated into a lattice mesostructural optimisation framework for AM . 
In , Messner presented the inverse homogenization , in which the macrostructural material properties of a periodic lattice consisting of simple unit cells are combined with a subsequent parameterization to obtain a 3D truss-like lattice structure with struts of round cross-sections and isotropic material behaviour . 
In the context of digital AM , it is worth mentioning , that such a parameterization of the design space is beneficial for better control over the geometrical layout using CAD-like environments and therefore bridging the gap between important intrinsic DfAM aspects . 
2 Graded lattices derived from mapping combined with density-based TO Various studies have utilized a mapping approach to update a cellular structure based on the density values obtained from unpenalized TO . 
Some of these use the abovementioned homogenization approach to map the unit cells achieving a more accurate mechanical response . 
In , a SIMP-solution provides the density distribution , which is mapped onto the explicit cellular structure , leading to the newly density-adjusted structure . 
In an FEA of a beam under three-point bending it was determined that the stiffness of the explicit cellular model increased with greater gradient density and lower cell size , approaching the implicit i.e . 
Great reliability of the numerical model was concluded after negligible differences in performance were obtained in comparison with the specimens created from SLA . 
An increase in stiffness by more than a third over the uniform lattice was revealed in the experiment , highlighting a viable design approach for structurally enhanced AM-parts . 
The dependence between cell size and performance elucidates the need for high-precision , fine-scale manufacturing in future work . 
Manufacturing of extruded 2D lattices is straightforward for most printing technologies , however , 3D cellular structures can pose a challenge for e.g . 
powder-based processes , as unconsolidated material is easily encapsulated in cavities . 
This was taken into consideration by Jin through manufacturing constraints such as the minimum section thickness , the minimum hole diameter and the uniformity of the section thickness i.e . 
The authors mapped the lattice of square cell honeycombs onto the density matrix of the TO-solution . 
The FEA reveals superior compressive performance of the developed graded lattice even with the manufacturing constraints over the uniform lattice . 
Similar to , the authors found that a decreasing cell size and an increasing gradient density has a positive effect on the structural performance . 
Song expanded the concept to irregularly shaped cells for AM . 
Here , a triangular mesh , obtained from a domain of unit tangent circles , is the basis for the formation of the cellular structure with predetermined cell/circle ratios . 
This irregular lattice is then mapped onto the density field obtained from unpenalized SIMP . 
Experimental tests showed that the irregular cell structure obtained from the unpenalized SIMP outperformed those using penalization . 
Mapping strut-based unit cells with different densities into a hexahedral mesh of a topologically optimized structure enabled Robbins to create structures with an external topology based on the penalized SIMP-result filled with a conformal lattice with properties determined from the homogenization method . 
The meshing was done with the Sandia 's Sculpt tool , allowing for the adaption and smoothing of the mesh at the boundaries , aiding the creation of a flawless and print-ready STL files . 
To guarantee the same weight of structures with various unit cell densities , the external topology was adapted accordingly , revealing an improved performance for less dense lattices . 
Even though the structure was printed using laser power bed fusion of stainless steel , no experimental verification was conducted , which is a recurring shortcoming in many of the reviewed studies on structural optimisation using either TO or lattices . 
While all the aforementioned studies solely focused on the performance aspects of the mapped structures , Panesar took also aspects of design and manufacturability into account . 
Hereby investigating intersected , scaled and graded lattices with strut- and surface-based self-supporting unit cells for design aspect like structural optimality , design effort , support requirements , robustness i.e . 
resilience to variation in loading and design-to-manufacturing discrepancy . 
The authors used a voxel paradigm , rather than the traditional volume boundary representation via B-rep , to represent lattices and employed an iso-value matrix , similar to , for functional grading . 
purely topologically optimized result . 
Authors highlighted the superiority of the proposed lattice types in terms of specific stiffness over the uniform lattice and the robustness of the graded lattice making it the most well-rounded performing lattice . 
Particularly , the lattices comprised of surface-based unit cells were found to result in more resilient structures . 
However , from a performance i.e . 
stiffness perspective , all lattices perform inferior compared to the solid pendant . 
Moreover , the cellular structures reduced the support structure requirements compared to the solid design . 
Similar to , the voxel-based method of Aremeu employs a net-skin approach , ensuring conformal lattices despite tessellation , through re-connecting strut-members at the boundary . 
The authors believe , that due to the limited resolvable resolution of AM machines , this method would satisfy the level of detail required for the model without high computational cost and geometrical complexity , however , no numerical nor experimental verification was conducted in this study . 
More recently Wang have topologically optimized a strut-based Kagome lattice structure based on the SIMP method with direct AM considerations . 
The novelty is that it represents a structure-based rather than a boundary-based TO and constitutes a method to increase the specific stiffness of the primitive unit cell . 
In an attempt to fine-tune the structural response of lattices , Maskery have recently observed a sequential failure of piece-wise graded BCC lattices in compression promoting increased energy absorption in comparison to the ungraded lattice . 
Furthermore , the results indicated non-homogeneous bulk properties , making the use of Gibson-Ashby models inadequate , as they are developed for uniform density lattices . 
It is important to note however , that this model is still useful for obtaining ballpark values for lattices through simple calculations . 
Due to the very specific failure mechanisms in graded lattices , future work ought to put more emphasis on the experimental verification in order to make more reliable predictions for their performance . 
3 Variable-density infills derived from density-based TO An emerging topic in structural optimization with a promising application for AM are TO-based compliance-driven infill strategies for porous material , which account for the principal stress directions imposed by the loading condition . 
Infills derived from homogenization-based TO , using projection-based methods , was subject under investigation in , making designs potentially more feasible for AM through the incorporation of a minimum length scale constraint for the microstructural features matching the print-resolution . 
In , this method was experimentally underpinned , demonstrating how self-supporting variable-density lattices can be generated . 
Work by Wu centres on SIMP , whereby in , solely the infills of 3D structures were optimized and the shell was represented by passive elements , whereas the approach in demonstrated a concurrent optimisation of shell and infill for 2D structures . 
In these structures were separated through multiple successive smoothing and projection steps combined with interpolations of intermediate densities to obtain discrete topologies with checkerboard-free domains and well-defined boundaries . 
In contrast to the standard objective function , a local rather than a global volume constraint was employed in both studies , meaning the density of the neighbouring elements was limited in a predefined radius , controlling the porosity locally . 
It was found , that higher radii result in topologies with coarser pores and greater stiffness as the local volume constraint becomes less influencing . 
Furthermore , Wu emphasized that these control parameters are beneficial for the manufacturability of parts intended for powder-based AM-processes , as closed walls cause entrapments . 
To avoid slender struts without infill , a length scale constraint is introduced in , which was implemented by an erosion and dilation projection before a final sensitivity analysis was conducted . 
Conversely , in , the authors introduce an anisotropic filter , forcing the material to accumulate in preferred i.e . 
a prescribed direction in order to resemble bone-inspired infills , resulting in truss-like formations . 
The filter , in particular , helped improve the uniaxial buckling stability . 
Recently , Wu have presented a computationally more efficient extension to their work that is using a simultaneous optimization of the shape and the distribution of the lattice , demonstrating a twofold increase in buckling load over the equivalent TO-solution . 
Besides weight reductions , improvements in damage tolerance and robustness generally illustrate greater functionality , mechanical capability and versatility of lattices , potentially outweighing the losses in stiffness for certain engineering problems compared to a solid solution . 
Another emerging topic for AM within topologically optimized and variable-density lattices , which will not be further discussed , are both multi-scale and multi-material structures . 
Primary investigations into a concurrent optimization of both macroscale and a micro-scale lattices , using two different materials , show great promise for the design-potential of AM . 
4 Strut-sizing and -scaling for structurally optimized truss-like structures Emerged from the idea to drastically decrease the computational complexity and processing time , the size matching and scaling method for mesoscale lattices , represents an alternative approach for structural optimisation . 
Besides the modification of the topology as certain struts that have a minor contribution to the structural performance are eliminated , the method mainly centres on the size optimisation of the struts . 
An average stress distribution of the solid body serves as the basis upon which the unit cell topology with geometrical features is determined prior to the mapping onto the initial geometry . 
Choosing the exact node size and thresholds for the upper and lower bounds of the strut diameter were deemed to be vital for the assurance of manufacturability with AM . 
Overall this does not take away from its feasibility for application in large structures as shown on the basis of a light-weight micro air vehicle fuselage and is , therefore , a viable alternative to pure TO . 
This method represents a lattice generation tool integrated into Siemens NX CAD software . 
In light of the multifunctional performance of lattices , Seepersad have demonstrated how a post-processing steps can be used to obtain lattice topologies with e.g . 
improved heat transfer , by effectively identifying lattice members that can be sacrificed , based on a hybrid FEA and finite difference approach . 
A more recent study has demonstrated a solution for a similar multifunctional optimization for a heterogeneous cellular structures using a decision support problem formulation . 
5 Evolutionary algorithms for structurally enhanced lattices Tang made use of a BESO-based approach to design a latticed engine bracket with optimal strut thicknesses , using a kernel-based algorithm . 
Points of the boundary and internal elements are subsequently separated , and the initial wireframe is mapped onto the boundary kernel points , followed by a trimming procedure used to remove wires outside the functional volume . 
Finally , these two sets of frames are merged together forming the final conformal lattice , which undergoes the BESO algorithm to modify the strut thickness based on the von Mises stresses obtained from the FEA of the homogenized functional volume and predetermined geometrical limits . 
The structural performance was improved in contrast to a homogeneous lattice and the weight reduced by up to 75 % over the original solid design . 
A recent study by Tang dealt with DfAM in the context of lattices and used BESO to locally improve the size of truss-like members , creating a heterogeneous lattice . 
In this study , a meta-model was created , which was comprised of the geometrical manufacturing constraints regarding the deflection of horizontal struts and the thickness of struts with reference to the inclination angle . 
Additionally , the optimized lattice structure led to an increase in stiffness over the traditional homogeneous pendant . 
Besides , the abovementioned more favourable examples for the use of evolutionary algorithms for the optimisation of lattices , Chu have conversely demonstrated eminent drawbacks of the PSO over the non-evolutionary LMO optimisation , due to the stochastic nature of such algorithms . 
Based on ground truss structures which were optimized for a given volume fraction and a set allowable deflection , the optimal strut dimensions were obtained with both algorithms . 
Results showed comparable structural performance but the superior computational efficiency and convergence of the LMO method . 
The integration of DfAM constraints into the optimisation algorithms remains a bottleneck for a streamlined design procedure , calling for benchmarking studies helping to identify more efficient approaches in digital AM in future work . 
2 Topologically optimized lattices employing commercial software As the role of AM in the industry is slowly shifting towards production , ready-to-use design software capitalizing on now amenable features like lattices , are becoming more readily accessible . 
3DXpert for Solidworks , nTopology or ANSYS which is providing a AM-specific design platforms . 
1 Modelling structurally optimized lattices for printing In the context of trusses , Gorguluarslan developed a two-phase lattice optimisation framework , specifically tackling the issue of the minimum manufacturable cross-section . 
Here a primary ground structure optimisation is followed by a rectification process in which elements falling below a certain minimum cross-sections threshold are eliminated , before a final optimisation step is conducted , for which the method of Feasible Directions is employed . 
Altair 's OptiStruct and HyperMesh were utilized for structural optimisation . 
Among others , the typical cantilever beam example was used to compare the effectiveness of the framework and the MFD algorithm with Chang and Rosen 's SMS method and the Relative Density Mapping of Alzahrani , respectively . 
Under restriction of the minimum feature size , MFD was identified to outperform SMS and RDM in terms of stiffness but required more computational effort . 
However , it was also found that designs obtained from genetic algorithms and PSO have an even superior structural performance . 
In Abaqus served as a tool for the TO within the RDM method . 
Compared to the SMS method , the density values of the TO are used to map the struts into the domain , making RDM less dependent on the FEA analysis . 
Arisoy developed a framework for the substitution of solid parts of a CAD model with lattices , which served as the basis for a plugin in Siemens 's NX CAD software . 
boundary surface defining the layout of the lattice . 
During the FEA of the solid part , meshed with tetrahedral elements , a remeshing process including trimming is conducted ensuring that the elements are part of the lattice . 
Besides an improved and efficient workflow for AM , the authors concluded to have improved the boundary smoothness of the lattices with the implicit volume representation , so that the manufacturability for AM is improved . 
In terms of digitalization and streamlining the design process , this study demonstrated great promise , as the lattices were modelled within the same CAD environment . 
Based on the design optimisation of a missile launcher beam on a macro- and mesoscale , H exemplarily demonstrated the potential of multi-scale optimisation . 
They have effectively combined TO with partial substitution of solids with lattices , to design a lightweight beam using the commercial software Altair Inspire and Materialise Magics . 
2 Experimental benchmarking of 3D-printed lattices In contrast to the previous studies , Beyer and Figueroa tested different unit cell structures experimentally and Harl even determined the performance of optimized lattice structures by comparing them to numerical results . 
The experimental verification is vital as structural optimisation and DfAM aspects are mutually dependent . 
This stems from the individual characteristics and limitations of different AM processes affecting the properties . 
As outlined by Gibson , this is related to common meso- and microstructural features of cellular structures , affecting the structural performance , including : 1 ) material properties ; 2 ) cell topology and shape ; 3 ) relative density of structure . 
As the process-parameters influence the microstructure and consequently the performance , verification with the numerical model becomes vital for estimating the actual properties and improving future models . 
In , Netfabb 's Selective Space Structures tool was utilized to create lattices from rectangular prisms and hexagonal geometries , which were subsequently manufactured using the PolyJet and SLM process for polymers and aluminium , respectively . 
The compression and flexure tests of unit cells composed of a polymer revealed that the hexagonal unit cells show greater yield strengths and that comparable properties with the solid pendant can most likely be achieved with vertical trusses in the cell . 
Within the scaled lattices fabricated from polymer and aluminium , it was found that the kagome structure displayed the best performance-to-mass ratio . 
Moreover , it was reported that the aluminium lattice was superior to the polymer counterpart with respect to the solid structures , possibly stressing differences in manufacturing and therefore highlighting the role of DfAM . 
A connection between relative cell density , unit cell structure and structural performance , was established , giving designers and engineers helpful indications for the selection of the adequate lattice configuration . 
Similarly , Harl employed the CAESS ProTOp software for both the lattice generation and the subsequent TO of the lattice . 
The latter was conducted to improve the structural performance by lowering the local stress concentration to which cellular structures are prone to . 
Using selective laser sintering with polyamide , the designs were tested in flexure and the results clearly highlight the potential of using TO lattices in terms of weight-reduction , robustness and stiffness as well as its superiority over uniform lattices . 
The next paragraphs build on this idea of TO cellular structures by locally changing the cell density with the use of commercial software . 
In a study by Rezaie a beam under three-point bending was topologically optimized using Abaqus and subsequently manufactured in ABS using FDM . 
Here , the external boundaries of the bounding box were preserved , and the lattice composed of hollow cubic unit cells was mapped onto a SIMP-result . 
Additionally , manufacturability was taken into consideration by tailoring the hole-size to match the printer 's resolution . 
In comparison with the standard topologically optimized beam , the loss in performance turned out to be very minor . 
Especially when considering the more fabrication-friendly design of the cellular lattice , this method can be a viable alternative for lightweight structures . 
The significance of the results , however , must be reviewed critically , due to insufficient batch size and the well-known and inherent quality fluctuations in AM . 
Improved quality control measures are therefore needed form a manufacturing standpoint while an extensive data library will ease the choice in adequate lattice configurations from a design perspective . 
These aspects constitute -among others - a necessity with the increasing uptake of AM across industries . 
With the combination of the density-gradients from TO with a size optimisation , Daynes derived functionally graded truss-structures that align with the isostatic lines i.e . 
the principal stresses during loading . 
By making use of the Altair OptiStruct software , a topologically optimized design is automatically obtained , substituted by pre-selected unit cells before a size optimisation ensures that the overall target density is achieved . 
Upon the information on in-plane stresses and orientation extracted from the software , the authors developed a MATLAB subroutine to create a functionally graded mesh , which was fed back into the software for analysis . 
The substitution of the domain with BCC unit cells conformal with the isostatic lines resulted in a graded lattice with improved structural performance . 
Twice the stiffness and about 75 times greater strength were demonstrated in the experimental three-point bending tests compared to the uniform lattice design . 
These study highlights how much potential is still untapped in commercial software regarding the utilization of tailored , functionally graded lattices for enhanced specific structural performance . 
3 Commercial and academic software solutions for TO and the generation of cellular structures AM-specific design tools , incorporating TO or the implementation of lattices , are central to the greater adoption of AM . 
Today 's software landscape for AM-specific design provides a range of features that have been summarized in the supplementary information of this review . 
It is important to note , that the majority of commercial software to-date solve specific problems that are common for a wide range of industrial applications . 
14a illustrates the proportionate distribution of underlying TO-methods/approaches in commercial software to-date . 
14b constitutes the predominant file formats available in current lattice generation software . 
Analogously , lattice generation software is dominated by STL file formats , however , with the emerging complexity in e.g . 
multi-material prints we see the adoption and market share increase of 3MF and AMF file formats . 
To evaluate the effectiveness of the different software , more benchmarking research will be needed . 
A first attempt , recently published by Saadlaoui compared the performance of a topologically optimized cube under compression loading using Optistruct and Abaqus . 
A stress-constrained optimisation and a discrete-compliance optimisation were conducted in Abaqus as well as a continuous compliance optimisation in Optistruct . 
Both numerical and experimental results were obtained for the three approaches , whereby SLM was adopted for the fabrication of the specimens . 
This was explained by the consideration of internal material behaviour for the numerical model rather than the external criteria in the experiment . 
This aspect also includes local plastic deformations in the actual specimen , which do not necessarily affect the global elastic properties or mechanical strength and which are not accounted for in the commonly employed linear-elastic computational models , as stated by Saadlaoui . 
In terms of the computational procedures , the study revealed that the stress-constrained optimisation approach has the highest computational cost , but the corresponding specimen demonstrated the best mechanical performance with respect to the ratio of strength to weight . 
Computational efficiency and power are particularly important in continuum structural optimisations and will be key for viable design procedures in large-scale , multifunctional , multiscale and cellular-based TO . 
Recent efforts made to improve the feasibility of TO codes for machines with standard computational performance are equally important as the more salient examples , exploiting immense resources to explore what is ultimately possible . 
General conclusions , drawn from this review , can be summarized as : Superior solutions/designs for AM-parts can be obtained using structural optimization methods such as TO if DfAM considerations are included . 
This elucidates the need for a holistic design approach , paving way for how we design for AM in the future . 
Aspects of digitalization are still somewhat underrepresented and pose a bottleneck between design and manufacturing , including computationally inexpensive models and an entirely self-contained process from CAD file to Gcode . 
To bridge the gap to manufacturing , CAD/CAM software needs to be further improved , pathing among others the way for greater efficiency and compatibility when post-processing digital designs . 
Both multifunctional TO-based designs , considering multiple objectives and part-integration as well as latticing were considered particularly promising for lightweight high-performance parts . 
Functionally graded structures , specifically those that are optimized to better conform to the load trajectories , are inciting increased research interest . 
The most prominent TO method , both in academia and industry , is the density-based approach assuming isotropic material property . 
Level set methods seem to establish themselves increasingly in the market , due to the intrinsic smooth boundary representation , which is of great benefit for a streamlined design procedure . 
The sheer amount of software available for both TO and latticing that includes AM-specific design constraints , clearly demonstrates the industry is gravitating towards a wide application of AM . 
This is supported by the intensified interest in the academic community to make optimisation process more computationally efficient which is a necessity to make AM more accessible for a range of industries . 
As reviewed , the majority of studies concentrate on structural optimisation with the inclusion of inclination angle constraints as opposed to fabrication , materials or digitalization . 
Aspects deemed important for future work on the design and structural optimisation in AM , are as follows : Consistency through benchmarking mathematically-driven models and confidence via experimental verification will be important as industries are on the verge of adopting AM as means of production . 
Structural analyses accommodating path planning i.e . 
tailored infills and a simultaneous optimization of process and design will constitute a central aspect to improved structural performance in the future . 
In conjunction with a growing interest in fibre-reinforced AM , a key challenge will be to develop TO methods that account for anisotropic material considerations , paving the way for next-generation lightweight structures . 
The digital AM-workflow for print-ready designs would immensely benefit from smooth boundary representations . 
post-processing procedures for discrete solutions and more recently the intensified use of the level set method were observed . 
Their uptake by the industry into upcoming software could potentially constitute a boost for the future of AM . 
In light of both increasing complexity through the inclusion of DfAM constraints and multi-objective optimization as well as the orientation towards large-scale designs , generating high-resolution designs efficiently , will become a key challenge across all TO methods in the future . 
Contrary to previous developments , the industry pulls academia with regard to generative design , rather than taking solutions up . 
Due to the feasibility of economically producing large-scale metal components with relatively high deposition rates , significant progress has been made in the understanding of the Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing process , as well as the microstructure and mechanical properties of the fabricated components . 
As WAAM has evolved , a wide range of materials have become associated with the process and its applications . 
This article reviews the emerging research on WAAM techniques and the commonly used metallic feedstock materials , and also provides a comprehensive over view of the metallurgical and material properties of the deposited parts . 
Common defects produced in WAAM components using different alloys are described , including deformation , porosity , and cracking . 
Methods for improving the fabrication quality of the additively manufactured components are discussed , taking into account the requirements of the various alloys . 
The integration of materials and manufacturing process to produce defect-free and structurally-sound deposited parts remains a crucial effort into the future . 
In recent years , wire arc additive manufacturing has increasingly attracted attention from the industrial manufacturing sector due to its ability to create large metal components with high deposition rate , low equipment cost , high material utilization , and consequent environmental friendliness . 
The origin of the WAAM process can be traced back to the 1925s when Baker proposed to use an electric arc as the heat source with filler wires as feedstock materials to deposit metal ornaments . 
The WAAM technique bears various nomenclatures by different research institutions worldwide , as shown in 1 . 
Today , WAAM has become a promising fabrication process for various engineering materials such as titanium , aluminium , nickel alloy and steel . 
Compared to traditional subtractive manufacturing , the WAAM system can reduce fabrication time by 40and post-machining time by 15depending on the component size . 
For instance , recent breakthroughs in WAAM technology have made it possible to fabricate aircraft landing gear ribs with a saving of approximately 78 % in raw material when compared with the traditional subtractive machining process . 
Due to the highly complex nature of WAAM , many different aspects of the process need to be studied , including process development , material quality and performance , path design and programming , process modelling , process monitoring and online control . 
Several WAAM review papers have been published by leaders in the field , covering state-of-the-art systems , design , usage , in-situ process monitoring , in-situ metrology and in-process control and sensing . 
Nevertheless , there is still a need for a systematic review of the properties of various WAAM-processed materials , the defects associated with different alloys , and a summary of current and future research directions that are aimed at quality improvements for the alloy classes of interest . 
This paper reviews the microstructure and mechanical properties of various metals , including titanium and its alloys , aluminum and its alloys , Ni-based alloy , steel and other intermetallic materials fabricated by the various WAAM processes . 
The common defects that have been found to occur for different materials are also summarized . 
The current methods for both in-process and post-process quality improvement and defect reduction are introduced . 
Finally , a discussion is given on improving quality of WAAM fabricated parts through process selection , feedstock optimization , process monitoring and control and post-process , including proposals for future research directions . 
2 Wire arc additive manufacturing systems 2.1 Classification of WAAM process Depending on the nature of the heat source , there are commonly three types of WAAM processes : Gas Metal Arc Welding -based , Gas Tungsten Arc Welding -based and Plasma Arc Welding -based . 
As listed in 1 , specific class of WAAM techniques exhibit specific features . 
The deposition rate of GMAW-based WAAM is 2times higher than that of GTAW-based or PAW-based methods . 
However , the GMAW-based WAAM is less stable and generates more weld fume and spatter due to the electric current acting directly on the feedstock . 
The choice of WAAM technique directly influences the processing conditions and production rate for a target component . 
2.2 Robotic WAAM system Most WAAM systems use an articulated industrial robot as the motion mechanism . 
Two different system designs are available . 
The first design uses an enclosed chamber to provide a good inert gas shielding environment , similar to laser Power-Bed Fusion systems . 
The second design uses existing or specially designed local gas shielding mechanisms , with the robot positioned on a linear rail to increase the overall working envelop . 
It is capable of fabricating very large metal structures up to several a meters in dimension . 
2 shows an example of this design of WAAM system , used for the research and development at the University of Wollongong . 
Fabricating a part using WAAM involves three main steps : process planning , deposition , and post processing . 
For a given CAD model , 3D slicing and programming software generates the desired robot motions and welding parameters for the deposition process , aimed at producing defect-free fabrication with high geometrical accuracy . 
Based on the welding deposition model for the specific material being used to fabricate the component , the 3D slicing and programming software offer automated path planning and process optimization to avoid potential process-induced defects . 
During fabrication , the robot and external axis provide accurate motion for the welding torch to build up the component in a layer-by-layer fashion . 
Advanced WAAM systems can be equipped with various sensors to measure welding signals , deposited bead geometry , metal transfer behaviour and interpass temperature , thereby supporting in-process monitoring and control to achieve higher product quality . 
This is an area of current and future research interest , with the potential for significantly improving WAAM process performance . 
3 Metals used in WAAM process WAAM processes use commercially available wires which are produced for the welding industry and available in spooled form and in a wide range of alloys as feedstock materials . 
2 indicates the commonly used alloys and their various applications in WAAM . 
Manufacture of a structurally sound , defect free , reliable part requires an understanding of the available process options , their underlying physical processes , feedstock materials , process control methods and an appreciation of the causes of the various common defects and their remedies . 
This section reviews the metals that are commonly used in WAAM , with a particular emphasis on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the additively manufactured alloys . 
3.1 Titanium alloys Titanium alloys have been widely studied for application of additive manufacturing in aerospace components due to their high strength-to-weight ratio and inherently high material cost . 
There are increasing demands for more efficient and lower cost alternatives to the conventional subtractive manufacturing methods , which suffer very low fly-to-buy ratios for many component designs . 
There exists many business opportunities for the WAAM process , particularly for large-sized titanium components with complex structures . 
The distinctive WAAM thermal cycle , which involves repeated heating and cooling , produces meta-stable microstructures and inhomogeneous compositions in the fabricated part . 
For example , Baufeld investigated the microstructures of Ti6Al4V fabricated using a GTAW-based WAAM system , and found two distinctive regions on the as-built wall . 
In the bottom region , where alternating bands are perpendicular to the build direction , a basketwave Widmanststructure with phase lamellae is present , while in the top region , where no such bands appear , needle-like precipitate is the main structure . 
Similar microstructural evolution has also been observed in the PAW-based process . 
Lin reported a graded microstructure along the build direction and identified the martensite structure , Widmanststructure and basket-wave structure from the bottom to the top region of the fabricated component , as shown in 3 . 
An epitaxial growth of grains with discrete direction is also observed along the build direction owing to thermal gradient , commonly seen in additively manufactured titanium alloy components . 
3 summarizes the microstructure and mechanical property data of Ti6Al4V samples fabricated using various WAAM technologies . 
The as-forged and as-cast minimum specifications from ASTM standards are also listed for comparison . 
As shown in 4 , the tensile property of as-fabricated Ti6Al4V samples is close to that of wrought Ti6Al4V and exceeds that of cast Ti6Al4V as specified by ASTM standards . 
In addition , WAAM fabricated Ti6Al4V samples show anisotropic properties with lower strength and higher elongation values in the build direction compared to deposition direction , which is mainly attributed to the grain size of lamellae and the orientation of the elongated prior grains . 
3.2 Aluminum alloys and steel Although fabrication trials for many different series of aluminum alloys , including Al-Cu , Al-Si and Al-Mg have been successfully carried out , the commercial value of WAAM is mainly justifiable for large and complex thin-walled structures , since cost of manufacturing small and simple aluminum alloy components using conventional machining processes is low . 
Using WAAM to fabricate steel is unpopular for the same reason although it is the most commonly used engineering material . 
Another reason for the poor commercial application of WAAM in aluminum is that some series of aluminum alloys , such as Al 7xxx and 6xxx , are challenging to weld due to turbulent melt pool and weld defects , which frequently occur during the deposition process . 
In general , as-deposited additively manufactured aluminum alloy parts have inferior mechanical properties compared to those machined from billet material . 
In order to achieve higher tensile strength , most of the as-deposited aluminum parts undergo post-process heat treatment to refine the microstructure . 
4 lists the yield strength , ultimate tensile strength , and elongation of WAAM-fabricated 2219aluminium alloy samples . 
Due to the uniform distribution of large diamond particles within the microstructure , the sample exhibits lower UTS and YS than that of the wrought part specified by ASTM standard . 
However , after heat treatment , significant improvement beyond ASTM standard can be observed in both strength and elongation as a consequence of the grain refinement . 
3.3 Nickel-based superalloys Nickel-based superalloys are the second most popular material studied by the additive manufacturing research community after titanium alloys , mainly due to their high strengths at elevated temperatures and high fabrication cost using traditional methods . 
Nickel-based superalloys are widely applied in aerospace , aeronautical , petrochemical , chemical and marine industries due to their outstanding strength and oxidation resistance at temperatures above 550 To date , various Nickel-based superalloys , including Inconel 718 and Inconel 625 alloy have been studied after WAAM processing . 
The microstructure of WAAM fabricated Inconel 718 parts generally consists of large columnar grains with interdendritic boundaries delineated by small Laves phase precipitates and MC carbides . 
Xu reported that columnar dendrite structures decorated with a large amount of Laves phase , MC carbides and Ni3Nb are also present in WAAM-fabricated Inconel 625 parts , as shown in 5 . 
It is worth noting that the microstructure can be refined to smaller dendritic arm spacing , less niobium segregation and discontinuous Laves phase in the interdendritic regions using post-process heat treatments , which are beneficial to the mechanical properties . 
5 lists the mechanical properties of several Nickel-based superalloys fabricated using the WAAM process . 
For GMAW-based WAAM-fabricated Inconel 718 alloy , the yield and ultimate tensile strength is 473 6 MPa and 828 8 MPa respectively . 
These values lie between the minimum values specified by ASTM for wrought and cast materials , whereas the elongation is much lower than the standards for both wrought and cast conditions . 
As for WAAM-fabricated Inconel 625 alloy , the YS , UTS and elongation all meet the requirement set by ASTM for cast materials , and are slightly lower than those for wrought material . 
3.4 Other metals Other metals have also been investigated for potential fabrication using WAAM , such as magnesium alloy AZ31 for automotive applications , Fe/Al intermetallic compounds and Al/Ti compounds , as well as bimetallic steel/nickel and steel/bronze parts for the aeronautic industry . 
The detailed mechanical properties of these materials fabricated using WAAM are listed in 6 . 
Most of this research has focused on determining the microstructural and mechanical properties of samples taken from simple straight-walled structures , rather than developing a process to fabricate functional parts . 
Manufacturing intermetallic parts with accurate pre-designed composition still poses major challenges for the WAAM process . 
4 Common defects in WAAM-fabricated component Although the mechanical properties of components fabricated by WAAM are in many cases comparable to those of their conventionally processed counterparts , there are however some AM processing defects that must be addressed for critical applications . 
Porosity , high residual stress levels , and cracking , must be avoided , particularly for parts exposed to extreme environments where these defects lead to failure modes such as high temperature fatigue . 
Defects in WAAM can occur for various reasons , such as poor programming strategy , unstable weld pool dynamics due to poor parameter setup , thermal deformation associated with heat accumulation , environmental influence and other machine malfunctions . 
As shown in 6 , certain materials tend to be vulnerable to specific defects . 
For example , severe oxidization for titanium alloys , porosity for aluminum alloys , poor surface roughness in steel as well as severe deformation and cracks in bimetal components have been found to typically occur . 
7 lists the major defects that are commonly present in components fabricated using current WAAM techniques . 
The details of these common defects and their relationship to the materials will be discussed this section . 
4.1 Deformation and residual stress Like other additive manufacturing process , distortion and residual stress are inherent to the WAAM process and it is impossible to completely avoid its generation . 
The residual stress can lead to distortion of the part , loss of geometric tolerance , delamination of layers during deposition , as well as deterioration of fatigue performance and fracture resistance of the additively manufactured components . 
Therefore , control and minimization of deformation and residual stress is a key area if research . 
Various types of deformation appear in WAAM fabricated parts , including longitudinal and transvers shrinkage , bending distortion , angular distortion and rotational distortion . 
The distortions are caused by thermal expansion and shrinkage of the part during repeated melting and cooling processes , which is particularly an issue for large thin walled structures . 
Residual stress is the stress that remains in the material when all external loading forces are removed . 
If the residual stress is sufficiently high , it can be a critical influential factor in the mechanical properties and fatigue performance of the fabricated component . 
If the residual stress exceeds the local UTS of the material , cracking will take place , while if it is higher than the local YS but lower than UTS , warping or plastic deformation will occur . 
Ding found that the residual stress uniformly distributes across the WAAM deposited wall , and the residual stress in the preceding layer has little effect on the future layers . 
After release of clamping , however , the internal stress is redistributed with a much lower value at the top of integral part than at the interface to the substrate , resulting in bending distortion of the component . 
Path planning also involves the distortion and residual stress evolution in WAAM process . 
If appropriate deposition path designs , it will help in the significant improvement in these defects , especially in large metal fabrication . 
A detailed overview of the residual stress origin would exceed the scope of this article . 
Among all WAAM engineering materials , bimetal components exhibit high levels of residual stress and deformation due to the material thermal expansion difference . 
Hence , accurate interpass temperature control is needed when bimetal materials are used . 
WAAM-fabricated Inconel alloy has comparatively lower residual stresses levels , but it is more susceptible to process defects such as delamination , buckling and warping , since its residual stress is usually higher than the yield stress . 
Other comparatively softer materials , such as aluminum alloys , easily respond to deformation defects due to their high thermal expansion coefficients . 
A better understanding pf the effect of material characteristics in WAAM processing is needed for controlling residual stress and deformation during deposition . 
Deformation and residual stress are associated with many process parameters , such as welding current , welding voltage , feeding speed , ambient temperature , shielding gas flow rate , etc . 
Fortunately , several post-process treatments that have been proven to effectively mitigate residual stress and deformation , and these will be discussed 5 . 
4.2 Porosity Porosity is another common defect in WAAM processing that needs to be minimized due to adverse effects on mechanical properties . 
Firstly , porosity will lead to a component with low mechanical strength by damage from micro-cracks , and secondly , it usually brings low fatigue property to deposition via spatially with different size and shape distribution . 
In general , this type of defects are mainly classified as either raw material-induced or process-induced . 
The WAAM raw material , including as-received wire and substrate , often has a degree of surface contamination , such as moisture , grease and other hydrocarbon compounds that may be difficult to completely remove . 
These contaminants can be easily absorbed into the molten pool and subsequently generate porosity after solidification . 
Among common engineering materials , aluminum alloy is the most susceptible to this defect as the solubility of hydrogen in solid and liquid is significantly different . 
Even small amounts of dissolved hydrogen in the liquid state may exceed the limit of solubility after solidification , resulting in porosity . 
Therefore , the cleanliness of raw materials is critical , especially for aluminum alloys . 
Process-induced porosity is usually non-spherical , and mainly caused by poor path planning or an unstable deposition process . 
When the deposition path is complex or the manufacturing process is changeable , insufficient fusion or spatter ejection is easily produced , creating gaps or voids in these influenced regions . 
To control porosity , the following methods can be adopted : an AC GMAW-based process or CMT-PADV based process is preferred , especially for aluminum ; the highest quality shielding gas , tight gas seals , non-organic piping and short pipe lengths are highly recommended ; the wire and substrate surfaces are as clean as possible before fabrication ; high quality feedstock should be used ; the deposited bead shape needs to be optimized ; the thermal profile during processing should be monitored and controlled ; post-deposition treatment , such as interpass rolling can be applied . 
4.3 Crack and delamination Similar to residual stress and deformation , cracking and delamination not only involves the thermal signature of the manufacturing process , but also relates to the material characteristics of the deposit . 
Ordinarily , the crack is categorised as either a solidification crack or grain boundary crack within the WAAM component . 
The former type of crack depends mainly on the solidification nature of the material and is usually caused by the obstruction of solidified grain flow or high strain in the melt pool . 
Grain boundary cracking often generates along the grain boundaries due to the differences between boundary morphology and potential precipitate formation or dissolution . 
Generally , this deficiency is visible and can not be repaired by post-process treatment . 
In order to prevent this defect , pre-process treatment such as preheating of the substrate needs to be considered . 
Bimetal material combinations , such as Al/Cu , Al/Ti and Al/Fe , are quite susceptible to cracking and delamination when fabricated with the WAAM process . 
The dissimilar metals have large differences in their mutual solubility and chemical reactivity so that the intermetallic phase-equilibrium is freely broken , thus inducing crack growth along grain boundaries . 
Also , Inconel alloy readily generates solidification cracking issues due to the existence of liquid film at terminal solidification . 
Both of these material types should receive particular attention to avoid cracking and delamination . 
To control crack defects , corresponding measures can be taken as follows : Mixed wires and optimization of their compositions ; Decrease the cooling rate during the deposition process Other measures to improve strength rather than solution treatment . 
5 Current methods for quality improvement in the WAAM process Generally , WAAM parts require post-process treatment to improve material properties , reduce surface roughness and porosity , and remove residual stress and distortions . 
By appropriate application of post process , the majority of issues that influence deposition quality can be mitigated or eliminated . 
Presently , several post-process treatment technologies have been reported to improve part quality in the WAAM process . 
5.1 Post-process heat treatment Post-process heat treatment is widely used in WAAM to reduce residual stress , enhance material strength and as a method of hardness control . 
The selection of a suitable heat treatment process depends on the target material , additive manufacturing methods , working temperature and heat treatment conditions . 
If the heat treatment state is set incorrectly , the probability of cracking will increase under mechanical loading , as the combination of existing residual stress with load stress exceeds the materialdesign limitation . 
As summarized s 3after heat treatment , the mechanical strength of WAAM-fabricated parts improved significantly , with increase of 4 % , 78 % , 5 % and 17 % being reported for titanium alloy , aluminum alloy , Nickel-based superalloys and intermetallic Ti/Al alloy , respectively . 
In addition , post-process heat treatment plays an important role in grain refinement , especially for WAAM-fabricated aluminum and Inconel alloy . 
The decision to use post-process heat treatment depends on the material alloying system and also the pre-heat treatment state . 
Generally , high carbon content materials must be heat treated , while a few materials can be damaged by this technique . 
Therefore , the utilization of post heat treatment process to WAAM component needs to consider the specific material and its application . 
5.2 Interpass cold rolling Rolling of the weld bead between each deposited layer has been shown to reduce residual stresses and distortion.Interpass cold rolling not only lowers residual stress , but also brings more homogeneous material properties . 
In the WAAM process , the thermal gradient with deposition layers and alternate re-heating and re-cooling process result in the target part having anisotropic microstructural evolution and mechanical properties . 
The cold rolling technique significantly reduces microstructural anisotropy through plastically deforming the deposition . 
7 shows the schematic diagram of an interpass cold rolling system developed at Cranfield University . 
A slotted roller is used to refine the microstructure and enhance tensile strength in the longitudinal direction by supporting external force . 
As shown in 8 , both ultimate tensile strength and yield strength in the build direction were improved through interpass cold rolling , which contributes to more homogeneous material properties in the target component . 
Interpass cold rolling also can play a critical role in the healing of hydrogen porosity in WAAM-fabricated aluminum parts . 
Generally , high dislocation density is produced by the rolling process . 
These dislocation can act as preferential sites for atomic hydrogen absorption and as well as for the hydrogen , allowing to diffuse to the surface . 
9 summarizes the outcomes documented in the literature , in terms of the pore incidence and size distribution in aluminum components fabricated using WAAM with interpass cold rolling . 
The porosities existing in as-fabricated component can be reduced or even eliminated when interpass cold rolling is applied . 
This technique is only feasible for simple deposited parts , such as straight walls , due to the geometrical limitation of the rolling process . 
For more complex components with curves and corners , special flexible tooling need to be developed to achieve an effective rolling process , thus limiting the range of industrial application . 
Cold rolling technique will also reduce residual stress , but the ability to reduce overall part distortion is yet to be proven . 
5.3 Interpass cooling Recently , interpass cooling has been developed and evaluated at the University of Wollongong . 
8 presents the schematic diagram of a WAAM system with interpass cooling . 
The moveable gas nozzle , which supplies argon , nitrogen or CO2 gas , is used to provide active , or forced , cooling on the fabricated part during and/or after deposition of each layer . 
Using such rapid cooling , the in-situ layer temperature and heat cycle can be controlled within a range to obtain the desired microstructure and mechanical properties . 
This process may also potentially reduce residual stress and distortion , although this aspect has not been investigated . 
An initial feasibility study shows promising results when using forced interpass cooling with compressed CO2 to fabricate Ti6Al4V thin-walled structures , as shown in 9 . 
It was found that interpass cooling produces less surface oxidation , refined microstructure , improved hardness and enhanced strength . 
In addition , manufacturing efficiency is significantly improved due to the reduction of dwell time between deposited layers . 
More detailed research findings will be presented in future . 
5.4 Peening and ultrasonic impact treatment Peening and ultrasonic impact treatments have been used in welding applications to reduce local residual stress and improve weld mechanical properties . 
Both techniques are cold mechanical treatments that impact the weld surface using high energy media to release tensile stress by imposing compressive stress at the treatment surface . 
Usually , the mechanical peening process produces compressive stresses at a limited depth below the component surface , such as around 1mm in carbon steels . 
Ultrasonic impact treatment produces grain refinement and randomizes orientation , thus contributing to mechanical strength improvement . 
It is reported that after ultrasonic impact treatment , the surface residual stress of WAAM-fabricated Ti6Al4V part can be reduced to 58 % and the microhardness can be increased by 28 % compared to the as-fabricated sample . 
Also , the surface-modified layers undergo plastic deformation with significant grain refinement and dense dislocations . 
The ultrasonic impact treatment is limited by penetration depth , which is up to 60 below surface . 
Therefore , although both techniques are good post-process treatments , they have negligible effect on internal residual stresses of large metal part fabricated using WAAM . 
6 Discussion Improving process stability , eliminating or decreasing deposition defects and producing components with high quality and mechanical performance have become major research focuses in making the WAAM process more competitive against other additive manufacturing methods . 
An in-depth understanding of various materials , ideal process setup , in-process parameter control and post processing is essential for achieving such a goal . 
After a systematic review and analysis , a quality-based framework aiming to achieve high-quality and defects-free WAAM process is proposed , as shown in 10 . 
Three main aspects are considered : feedstock optimization , manufacturing process , and post-process treatment . 
Selection of the most suitable welding WAAM process for the deposition material can ensure manufacturing process stability and contribute to reduction of defects . 
For example , if the CMT-PADV process is used for producing aluminum parts , porosity defects can be dramatically reduced when compared to other GMAW modes . 
Moreover , integrated and reliable process monitoring and control systems are needed to maintain the stability of the process and ensure the quality of production . 
Usually , the bead geometry , interpass temperature , arc characteristics and metal transfer behaviour are included in process monitoring and control . 
Controlling the interpass temperature within a reasonable range is beneficial to microstructural evolution and the resulting mechanical properties . 
Further , regulating the arc characteristics and metal transfer behaviour in real time is helpful to process stability and avoidance of defects . 
Based on the process monitoring data that has been collected during deposition , one of several post-process treatments can be selected to mitigate defects and improve mechanical performance . 
Considering the material characteristics , microstructural evolution and mechanical properties can also be optimized through new feedstock composition design . 
It is well known that different alloying elements have specific effects on material properties . 
By referring to the phase diagram , the desired deposition microstructures can be obtained via adding specific alloying elements in the feedstock and subsequent mechanical properties improved . 
For example , twin-wire GTAW-based WAAM has been successfully developed to produce intermetallic graded materials . 
The development of new powder cored wires , will offer exciting opportunities for fabricating target components with accurate metal composition . 
In summary , using new welding consumables brings a cost effective solution , which supports high deposition quality through obtaining the desired microstructures , lowering manufacturing costs by reducing or eliminating pre-weld cleaning and re-work , and providing safer working environments by reducing weld fumes . 
Another essential part of WAAM processing for most materials is post-process treatment , which is used to reduce residual stresses and distortion , refine microstructures , improve microhardness and enhance material strength . 
However , post-process technologies have their own limitations , for instance , peening and ultrasonic impact treatment only improve material property and reduce defects near the part surface , while extended heat treatment of certain materials promotes grain growth rather than grain refinement . 
Currently , most WAAM fabricated parts need to be post-process treated with a selective combination of technologies to reduce the defects and improve the product quality to the greatest extent possible . 
7 Conclusions A detailed review of recent technological developments in WAAM process has been presented , with a focus on microstructure , mechanical properties , process defects and post-process treatment . 
Through matching a knowledge of material characteristics with the performance features of particular WAAM techniques , a quality-based framework is proposed , for producing high-quality and defect-free components . 
In WAAM of metallic materials , the fundamental interrelationships between material composition and microstructure govern the material properties and fabrication quality . 
Since the WAAM process is an inherently non-equilibrium thermal process , it is challenging to predicate and control the microstructural evolution , which is responsible for the variation of mechanical properties in the deposited part . 
Further research attention should be paid on the study of underlying physical and chemical metallurgical mechanisms in WAAM process to provide a guidance for the process optimization , improvement and control . 
The defects generated in WAAM-produced part are closely related to the target material characteristics and process parameters . 
The development of strategies or ancillary process to overcome defects generation are of prime importance . 
As WAAM matures as a commercial manufacturing process , development of a commercially available WAAM system for metal components is an interdisciplinary challenge , which integrates physical welding process development , materials science and thermo-mechanical engineering , and mechatronic and control system design This study presents a review on powder bed laser additive manufacturing of stainless steel .

Asides from its high corrosion resistance property , stainless steel are malleable enough to be bent , folded , welded , machined and deep drawn , they also have a high heat conductivity and high strength . 
Stainless steels find extensive applications that include : chemical equipments , food processing equipments , cryogenic vessels , X-ray tube bases , heat exchangers , cutleries , jet-engine parts , automotive fasteners , valves , brewing equipments , and aircraft fittings . 
Methods of fabrication of stainless steel include hot forming processes and cold forming processes . 
Complex parts are broken down into smaller parts when these conventional manufacturing processes are used . 
These does not only make the process to be cumbersome but also heavier because of extra materials that are used in joining the several parts together . 
Additive manufacturing processes is an advanced manufacturing process that can produce complex parts no matter the complexity as a single unit part . 
Additive manufacturing is a modern method of fabrication process which is used in producing a functional engineering metallic components one layer at a time from computer aided design model data . 
There are various types of additive manufacturing technology , which include : vat photopolymerization , fused deposition modelling , selective laser sintering/melting , laminated object manufacturing and Laser metal deposition that is also referred to as . 
Vat photopolymerization is the first commercial additive manufacturing method that is used to create a layer of solidified material using ultraviolet radiation to selectively polymerize a curable resin until a complete part is formed . 
Its advantages includes high building speed and flexibility . 
Major disadvantages are high cost of materials and process errors due to over curing . 
Fused deposition modelling additive manufacturing is also referred to as material extrusion process , this process is used for fabricating 3D parts by deposition of laser heated thermoplastic filaments in a layer wise manner . 
With this method , complex durable parts can be easily manufactured with high accuracy . 
Draw-backs of this additive manufacturing technology include poor surface finish , time consumption and high porosity of manufactured parts . 
This method has been applied in automotive , aerospace , medical and plastic industries . 
Selective laser sintering/malting is a powder bed additive manufacturing method that involves atomic fusion/melting of metallic powder deposited in form of layers . 
Parts can be easily processed within a short time frame , it is flexible and accurate . 
This additive manufacturing method has been mostly used with metals such as stainless steel 316L austenitic grade , precipitated hardened stainless steel . 
Selective laser sintering has an extensive application in the field of aerospace , medical and automotive engineering due to the ability to control the stiffness of components in a desired model . 
Selective laser melting is a powder based bed fusion that is used to produce metallic components by deposition of a thin metallic powder on a substrate and using a high intensity laser beam to melt and fuse selective region of metallic powder according to the computer aided design data in a layer-wise fashion . 
This method has an advantage of less porosity of built parts with better mechanical property , manufacturability of complex shapes and excellent scanning efficiency . 
The disadvantage is similar to that of the process discuss earlier in terms of process control challenge due to too many parameters and also there is a material wastage . 
Selective laser melting has been extensively used with the employment of stainless steel . 
Selective laser melting has an extensive application in the field of aerospace , medical , automotive engineering and medical health care sectors . 
Benefits of this methods include good efficiency of material usage , parts with complicated shapes can be built , high strength material can be achieved , materials can be customized , it takes less time and it eliminated oxide impurities due to vacuum environment . 
Disadvantages of this methods are high price of set-up due to integration of vacuum with the machine for good thermal and impurity free environment , X-rays are formed during the process which is detrimental to human health . 
Laminated object additive manufacturing is an additive-subtractive rapid prototyping manufacturing process where 3D objects are manufactured by metal sheet material that are bonded together by thermally activated adhesive coating layer by layer . 
Each layer is formed from a sheet of paper coated with a thermoplastic adhesive and sheet is bonded together by using a heated stainless steel roller after which a CO2 laser cuts cross-section into a layer of paper according to the information from the CAD model repeatedly until the required object is formed and lamination is actualized . 
The process is simple and faster since the laser doesnhave to scan the entire area of the cross section . 
Merits of this method includes that fact that large size parts can be built , it is cheap , no microstructural alteration during the process , and it is flexible in the sense that component does not need support structures . 
Setbacks of this methods includes wastage of material during the subtractive process , complex internal cavities and hollow parts are difficult to build , and it has poor surface finishing . 
Laminated object manufacturing has been demonstrated in aerospace and tool design industries . 
Laser Metal Deposition , an additive manufacturing process , is used in building parts by melting a metal powder that is injected into a specific location by mean of a high power laser beam . 
The process of solidification and cooling occur in a closed chamber in an argon atmosphere so as to prevent oxidation of the melt pool . 
This process permits the use of high variety of metals and composites such as stainless steel mostly austenitic grades , which are mainly 316 , SS 316L , SS 304L and other exotic metals such as titanium and its alloys , composites and functionally graded materials . 
A major benefit of laser additive manufacturing technology is that , it provide new chances for customization of metallic components in terms of material composition manipulation and properties , improvements in product performance , and lower overall manufacturing costs due to its unique capabilities . 
Lots of research and discoveries has been achieved with laser metal deposition as an additive manufacturing method with the employment of stainless steel and stainless steel composite with much effort in enhancing wear resistance and strength property . 
This paper presents an overview of selective laser sintering and selective laser melting process of stainless steel . 
Some recent research works on stainless steel using these powder bed additive manufacturing techniques are presented and future research need are also proposed . 
Selective Laser Sintering of Stainless Steel This additive manufacturing process is a powder based layer-additive manufacturing process where metallic components are built section by section . 
A moderately low laser power is used in this process as metallic material never reach a liquid phase during the heating process . 
The process occurs at a faster rate at high temperature which is why it involves heating a powder . 
The process is achieved when the laser scan powder material deposited on the substrate on the 2D cross-section of the part created in 3D geometrical shape . 
The process is repeated in which after the first laser scan , the powder bed is lowered by the amount of thickness of the layer produced initially , and then a new layer of powder material is spread on the powder bed again on top of the initial scanned layer until a fully dense built part is produced . 
Selective laser sintering process has the potential to become one of the most valuable additive manufacturing techniques , because it has potential to easily produced complex shapes . 
The Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of the SLS process .

Few research investigations and studies have been done in the application of selective laser sintering with stainless steels . 
Stainless steel grades that has been involved in this process are the austenitic type mainly SS 316L and the precipitated hardened stainless steel grade PH .

It was discovered that the tensile strength of the DLMS part increased after heat treatment . 
Residual stresses remain in the het treated part with increased tensile strength due to rapid cooling without undergoing any post-processing stage . 
It was discovered after the analysis that the energy density will determine the mechanical property which implies that tensile strength of the stainless steel can be controlled by the combination of the machining parameters and energy density . 
Laser power and scanning speed will also determine the extent of surface roughness of the stainless steel . 
studied the deformation mechanism of 17-4 precipitated hardened stainless steel fabricated by direct metal laser sintering using micro pillar compression testing and transmission electron microscopy .

micro compression properties of the 17-4 precipitation hardened stainless steel was evaluated . 
Outcome revealed that the microstructure and properties of the 17-4 stainless steel stainless steel specimens vary significantly from those produced by conventional manufacturing methods because of fine grain evolution that emerged . 
Selective Laser Melting of Stainless Steel Selective Laser Melting process is an additive manufacturing technology that can be used to produce solid metallic components from metallic powder by using a high intensity laser to melt and fuse selective region of the metallic powder layer by layer according to the computer aided design data . 
A new layer of metal powder is applied and the build platform is being lowered by the amount of thickness of one layer . 
The process involves building of component layer by layer by depositing a thin metallic powder on a substrate . 
A high intensity power laser is then used to melt and fuse together a specific area of the metallic powder according to the data from the 3D CAD . 
Once the laser scanning is completed , succeeding layer of metallic powder is deposited on top and laser scans another new layer until the required component is completely built after repeated successive layer of metallic powder is deposited . 
Once the laser scanning processes completed , loose powders are removed from the building chamber and the component can be separated from the substrate plate manually or by electrical discharge machining . 
Schematic diagram describing the SLM process is shown in Figure 2 . 
Figure 2 : Schematic diagram selective laser melting process Numerous research has been conducted with the application of selective laser melting of stainless steel in the literature . 
Jandin 2005 investigated the influence of laser power strength on the porosity of component built . 
In their study , ytterbium fibre laser with a wavelength of 1065 nm was used to process the 316L stainless steel powder . 
The experiment showed that low laser power and high scanning speed caused incomplete melting of the powder material and resulted in high porosity in the components . 
This can be improved by increasing the laser power , and decreasing the scanning speed .

A detailed analysis of crystal orientation of formed dendrite was performed using geometrical analysis in collaboration with experimental findings . 
It was discovered that rapid solidification caused by high-speed scanning resulted into sub-micron grains within the final solidified microstructure . 
It was also detected that grain size and densification was a dependant on high volume energy density of the laser which will significantly affect the mechanical properties of the final product formed after solidification . 
Casati studied the microstructure and fracture behaviour of 316L austenitic stainless steel produced by selective laser melting and discovered that severe thermal gradients and high cooling rates affects the crystal growth and orientation of grain structure after solidification . 
This causes material spattering and microstructure defects like pores and incomplete melted particles . 
The influence of effect of different distribution of defects on mechanical response and failure mechanism were investigated using 316L bars with microstructure and texture built along two different orientations . 
It was concluded that semi-molten metallic powder particles of stainless steel 316L were responsible for the scattering and reduced strength of the material after solidification . 
Liu investigated the spatter behaviour of stainless steel 316L during selective laser melting process . 
It was discovered that spatter is caused as a result of negative impact of laser on the building of parts in successive layers during selective laser melting process . 
Two types of spatter were identified which were droplet spatter , generated by the tearing behaviour of molten metal and powder spatter , which are produced when non-metallic powder particles around the molten pool are blown away as a result of metallic vapour impact . 
It was discovered that oxygen composition increase during spatter and X-ray diffraction shows that diffraction peaks of austenite content and ferrite are low due to the formation of iron oxides . 
Li investigated the deformation behaviour of stainless steel micro-lattice structures produced by selective laser melting . 
Macroscopic deformation of micro-lattice structures and microscopic stress and strain evolution were studied using a full scale 3D finite element model .

Selective laser melting also been used to process martensitic grade of stainless steel . 
Krakhmalev investigated the evolution of microstructure in AISI 420 martensitic stainless steel during selective laser melting .

Material hardness was also increased due to reduction in porosity . 
Most of the research that has been done focused mostly on austenitic stainless steel grade , 316L and also on martensitic grade AISI 420 . 
Selective laser melting has been extensively explored with stainless steel but further study need to be done with the employment of other grades of stainless steel This review article summarizes the current state-of-the-art for biomimicry in additive manufacturing . 
Biomimicry is the practice of learning from and emulating nature - which can be increasingly realized in engineering applications due to progress in additive manufacturing . 
AM has grown tremendously in recent years , with improvements in technology and resulting material properties sometimes exceeding those of equivalent parts produced by traditional production processes . 
This has led to the industrial use of AM parts even in highly critical applications , most notably in aerospace , automotive and medical applications . 
The ability to create parts with complex geometries is one of the most important advantages of this technology , allowing the production of complex functional objects from various materials including plastics and metals that can not be easily produced by any other means . 
Utilizing the full complexity allowed by AM is the key to unlocking the huge potential of this technology for real world applications and biomimicry might be pivotal in this regard . 
Biomimicry may take different forms in AM , including customization of parts for individuals , or optimization for specific properties such as stiffness and light-weighting . 
The optimization process often uses an iterative simulation-driven process analogous to biological evolution with an improvement in every iteration . 
Other forms of biomimicry in AM include the incorporation of real biological inputs into designs ; the use of cellular or lattice structures for various applications and customized to the application ; incorporating multi-functionality into designs ; the consolidation of numerous parts into one and the reduction of waste , amongst others . 
Numerous biomimetic design approaches may be used broadly categorized into customized/freeform , simulation-driven and lattice designs . 
not for prototyping . 
The current limits of each design approach are discussed and the most exciting future opportunities for biomimetic AM applications are highlighted . 
The beauty found in nature is often inspirational - and this inspiration has found its way into functional mechanical engineering through the latest developments in additive manufacturing . 
Other forms of engineering beauty are structural hierarchy , order or lack of order , and combinations with other structures . 
Learning from these biological structures may advance our use of efficient structures in engineering applications and may even help to provide new solutions to engineering problems , in a sustainable way . 
Biomimicry in engineering involves the study of biological systems specifically with the aim to use information learned in solving engineering problems , or for use in engineering applications . 
In nature , structural features from nano to micro to macro scale define an objectproperties and functionalities and vice versa . 
Modern engineering design has the possibility to change the structural features and properties of the objects while maintaining functionality or to apply simulation to find a design for specific required properties . 
In an ideal case , AM is able to translate innovative biomimetic design into physical objects with the desired properties and functionality . 
Much of this potential has particularly realistic prospects when using AM , with its freedom of design and complex production capabilities . 
The capability to emulate the complex structures and hence the properties of biological materials is the aim of biomimicry . 
For example , failure of a specific design that is claimed to be biomimetic but uses no input from nature , might undermine the credibility of biomimicry . 
Often structures with curves and rounded edges in any way resembling something in nature are referred to as or This is not incorrect but it must be kept in mind that no biological input is present , and as such is not truly biomimetic or bio-inspired . 
Additionally , when a structure is designed for a biological application it may be termed biomimetic or bionic simply due to its intended biological role . 
Topology optimization , generative design and simulation-driven design tools used to create optimized designs using simulation often create unconventional and complex shapes and forms . 
The simulation-driven design process is in reality also biomimetic or bio-inspired in the sense that it is iterative and therefore mimics aspects of natural evolutionary strategies in a short timeframe . 
In the area of cellular or lattice structure design , some engineers refer to all porous engineered structures as biomimetic simply due to their resemblance to natural porous materials , or their similarity to the biological equivalent . 
However , cellular and lattice designs have unlimited design permutations and can therefore be tailored to the application . 
Currently , the most important application for these porous engineered structures is in dental and bone implants . 
The latter is a biomimetic application in the sense that the structure should emulate bone for best results , in terms of mechanical properties and permeability . 
Finally , biomimetic lattice structures may also specifically refer to stochastic design strategies which create structures with a random distribution of strut thicknesses and lengths the randomness emulates nature . 
A biomimetic and bio-inspired approach to materials design has attracted great interest from scientists in diverse areas : biophysics and biomaterials , sensors and chemistry , materials science and engineering , to name a few . 
From 2016 , with the progress in AM technology and wider understanding of the fact that complex designs can be realized in real AM products , biomimetic approaches began to be the subject of research in more than 150 papers per year . 
Interest in lattice structures produced by AM also increased year by year . 
In recent years AM has grown from a prototyping technology to a reliable direct production technique . 
In particular , metal AM has developed tremendously , up to the point where it is now possible to produce functional metal parts for critical applications in medical and aerospace industries . 
Powder bed fusion is the term used to specifically describe metal AM using a laser or electron beam to melt tracks and layers for the manufacture of detailed and complex shaped parts . 
The track-by-track and layer-by-layer PBF process allows the manufacturing of parts with intricate , complex designs . 
Part complexity allows designs to be optimized for specific applications such as light-weighting in aerospace parts or improving bone growth and implant success in bone implants . 
It has been demonstrated that the mechanical performance of PBF parts can be superior to traditionally manufactured equivalents and lots of work has been done in particular in Ti6Al4V as shown in . 
Laser powder bed fusion is limited to intricate parts typically smaller than 300 mm for larger metal parts it is possible to use wire and arc AM with a reduction in detail possible . 
In addition to metals , various other materials can be reliably processed using AM including polymers , ceramics and various types of composites , as is discussed in more detail in . 
Metals are highly likely to have practical uses in biomimetic structural applications in military , aerospace and automotive industries due to the light-weight and strong parts that can be produced , and hence much effort has been aimed in this direction . 
However , many biological systems are based on combinations of stiff and softer materials , and often have mechanical properties more like polymers and composite materials . 
Therefore , many applications also exist for nature-inspired designs in materials other than metals . 
Many of the examples presented in this review focus specifically on metal AM , due to their relevance for high-value functional end-use parts , but the same principles apply to all other additively manufactured materials . 
For products designed by biomimicry , it has been proposed that two broad approaches exist : the approach and the approach as outlined in . 
In the first case , the designer/engineer is inspired by a biological concept or model and applies this to a new design idea . 
In addition to these approaches , three major ways of obtaining a designed biomimetic model in practice exist : customized/freeform design , simulation-driven design and lattice design . 
For example , lattices may be incorporated in a freeform design process or in a simulation-design process . 
All these approaches may also be used with or without direct input from nature , with varying levels of biological input or bio-inspiration possible . 
Customized and freeform design involves manipulation with curved surfaces and is typically used to create custom and unique designs fit for a particular application while maintaining functionality . 
For instance , customized implants aimed at directly replicating the bone shape for replacement , tree-like support structures , nervous-system-inspired shade or hierarchical networks where nodes constantly branch and merge . 
This process is the simplest of the biomimetic design methods , particularly useful for customization such as in prosthetics or implants , and is also used in artistic design . 
With reference to prosthetics and implants , the design requirement is taken from a biological shape , hence the biomimetic description . 
In addition , freeform design results in organic shapes which can often resemble natural structures . 
Simulation-driven design is a very promising approach which has emerged in recent years and is especially useful for light-weight design for engineering applications . 
This involves structural optimization and uses an iterative process of simulation and material removal to optimize the required material distribution or material stiffness for a given set of expected load cases . 
This process of stepwise optimization is similar to most evolutionary processes in nature , and removal of material in areas of low stress is a similar optimization strategy as is used in natural systems , hence the motivation to categorize this process as biomimetic . 
The field of topology optimization in AM was reviewed recently in , where the current limits of the practical use of this technique was discussed in detail , especially with regards to overhang angle , support removal , residual stress , build quality including challenges in software tools that need to be solved for its more widespread adoption . 
The use of additively-manufactured lattice or cellular structures is a highly relevant approach which is often combined with the former methods , i.e . 
the incorporation of lattices or cellular designs into optimized organic or topology optimized designs . 
Natural systems often use cellular structures and these are widely used in bio-inspiration for the use of lattices in engineering parts , hence the categorization as biomimetic . 
Lattices have obvious light-weighting advantages , high specific stiffness , fracture toughness , crack growth arresting , amongst other desirable and tailorable properties . 
One major application of cellular structures is their use in bone implants , to improve osseointegration . 
The design theory for present-day AM in general was reviewed and limitations discussed in . 
On the topic of biomimetic 3D printing , the review gives a detailed overview of the use of biological inputs into the design process , discusses biological study systems used in biomimicry and focusses on applications of polymer and multi-material 3D printing , but does not discuss metal AM or simulation-driven design . 
Biomimetic approaches for AM include the design of innovative materials and systems . 
In addition to simulation-driven design of single-material parts , fracture-resistant composite materials could be designed using simulation-driven design and validated by multi-material 3D printing as demonstrated in . 
Multi-material biomimetic design for medical purposes has been demonstrated in . 
Not all freeform designs , lattice designs or topology optimized designs include biological input , but they are still referred to as biomimetic in a broader sense . 
True biological input in the AM design process is still rare in engineering due to the lack of biologists involved in engineering design in general . 
Nevertheless , biological materials science is a mature field which focuses on studying biological systems to understand their properties and potentially employ these designs in engineering systems . 
Biological materials often possess superior mechanical properties due to unique combinations of hard and soft materials and gradients between them . 
Biologically inspired design principles have been categorized recently into fibrous , helical , gradient , layered , tubular , cellular , suture and overlapping structures . 
Besides broad design categories or guidelines , the use of X-ray tomography to study intricate details of individual biological structures in 3D for biomimetic applications is also a promising strategy to learn from nature . 
Incorporating biological inputs into engineering design is a topic of continued effort and includes the development of biomimicry design databases . 
Biomimetic design has also been named as it has been suggested that these approaches may lead to the use of the minimum required materials , which is most environmentally sustainable . 
Despite the access to complexity and freedom of design , which is often cited for AM , all the biomimetic approaches discussed here have practical manufacturability limits in the context of present-day AM systems . 
A recent review paper covers the use of AM to produce bio-inspired structures with the main aim to learn about and optimize the biological structures themselves . 
In the area of biomimetic cellular design , various recent reviews are useful and relevant to bone implant applications in particular , and are more generally discussed for various applications in . 
It is therefore the aim of this present review paper to fill the gaps between these areas and address all the above biomimetic approaches in one cohesive framework . 
Most examples used in this paper are focused on metal AM due to its ability to produce functional end-use parts , but the principles are broadly applicable to all additively manufactured materials . 
While most of the discussion and examples are using laser powder bed fusion , other AM technologies are equally applicable and the design and challenges vary slightly with each technology . 
For example , binder jetting has shown some promise for realization of complex designs cost effectively , but the obtained material properties require investigation . 
The fields of biomimicry and AM hold a unique synergy and inter-dependence on one another . 
2 True biomimicry True biomimicry of natural form , involves the purposeful emulation of structure-function relationships in biological entities to solve engineering challenges , or to apply these to advanced engineering systems . 
A review on biomimicry and bio-inspiration in the field of AM and 3D printing is provided in and focuses on explaining different potential biological study organisms and associated applications with specific biological input , mostly by polymer AM . 
In addition , the review highlights the potential for different forms of AM technologies to mimic nature . 
As mentioned above , the goal of biomimetic research is to learn generic design rules from natural systems to assist the development of optimized biomimetic materials which can be used widely in engineering systems . 
To illustrate , osteoderms thin plates of dermal bone that form protective natural body armour in various animal species not only play a defensive role , but might also be involved in physiological processes such as thermoregulation . 
The structural changes required for a physiological capacity might decrease the strength of osteoderms , rendering the structure less optimally adapted for protection than what would be expected . 
Alternatively , a bio-inspiration approach can be employed to alter specific properties of the natural structure resulting in an optimal design . 
Glyptodon osteoderms consists of a lattice core sandwiched between two compact layers that form a shell . 
By printing and testing 3D models with varying lattice and shell parameters , the optimized shell thickness compared to lattice density and lattice strut thickness was revealed . 
Similar procedures have been used to reverse-engineer a natural structure for application as a gripping device the Aristotlelantern structure as described in . 
The mechanical properties of natural materials , particularly the superior fracture toughness , make biological structures highly suitable for biomimetic studies . 
Nevertheless , a major advantage of AM is that a structure of interest can be further optimized by using materials that do not occur naturally in biological systems . 
In the case of glyptodont osteoderms , the use of biomimetic reverse-engineered metal models show remarkable strength and energy absorption capacity . 
Besides material properties , the combination of hard and soft materials has been studied for improved fracture toughness properties using simulation-driven design tools . 
In a recent study , pangolin scales were used as inspiration for bendable protective material for aerospace applications different combinations of hard plates and soft connecting material were 3D printed and mechanically tested . 
Lastly , the microarchitecture of biological structures , which can be categorized as one of eight forms : fibrous , helical , gradient , layered , tubular , cellular , suture and overlapping , plays an important role in determining the mechanical properties of biological materials . 
These structural organizations can be replicated by AM to study and optimize the arrangement of biological materials as discussed in . 
Hierarchical structures such as functional graded materials , structures and surfaces can be produced directly by AM or in combination with other methods . 
For example , LPBF and femtosecond laser surface modification makes it possible to produce complex hierarchical structures for wettability applications . 
Stereolithography and LPBF was applied for manufacturing of a multi-material arm orthosis ; this approach can be used for manufacturing implants where the strength varies throughout the implant . 
In general , AM of in-situ LPBF sintered composite objects also is a form of biomimicry since biological tissues are composite materials with stiff reinforcing elements and binding medium . 
A pivotal tool to characterize structures for biomimicry or bio-inspiration is X-ray micro-computed tomography , as reviewed in . 
MicroCT is ideally suited to obtain detailed microstructural information of natural structures in 3D , which can be used to directly replicate natural structures , measure 3D design values and implement these in engineering structures as bio-inspiration , or in a broader sense to create a design principle without using any measurements . 
These three are shown in 3 , using the examples of a direct replication of a structure printed on an entry-level FDM printer , a reverse-engineered design based on measurements taken from a natural structure and a generic bio-inspiration example in which honeycomb structures are used as light-weight design . 
The main aim of direct replication is to investigate the structure of interest . 
For reverse-engineering , the goal is similar to that of direct replication , but the techniques make the structure more practical for direct engineering applications . 
The generic bio-inspiration involves using design or guidelines from nature , which might be more beneficial when limits are imposed on the structure . 
One biological structure that is of particular interest to biomimetic studies , and which has been studied extensively using microCT , is the lightweight structure of bird feathers and bones . 
Here , bio-inspiration and design rules might be applied in engineering designs for aerospace applications . 
In recent work using topology optimization techniques , an optimized light-weight structure for an airplane wing was demonstrated through simulation and optimization , with the obtained structure having a strong resemblance to the structure of bird wing bones , i.e. 
, a solid shell and connecting rods at angles inside the hollow structure . 
While the optimality of bone design had been well described analytically , this was the first example of large-scale computational structure design : the rapid increase in computing power over the last years now allows for obtaining detailed structures from simulation-driven design tools , which for the first time nears the complexity of natural systems . 
In conclusion , the complexity that AM allows makes it possible to manufacture true biomimetic structures , yet , knowledge of the biological structure is necessary . 
3 Customized and freeform design Traditional design for engineering involves individual part design in computer-aided design tools , with engineering expertise and intuition required to understand the limits of traditional subtractive manufacturing . 
This most often results in traditional designs with right angles and flat surfaces due to the simplicity for subtractive manufacturing of such designs . 
Over the last few years , advanced manufacturing techniques have become available and viable which allows the design engineer more freedom to create parts with more complex designs . 
These new design capabilities allow organic shapes and freeform designs , which are often also termed biomimetic due to their organic shapes resembling natural structures and sometimes , in the case of medical devices in particular , the forms are shaped to fit natural materials such as bone implants . 
Natural structures tend to comprise of curves and organic shapes as they represent a balance between minimal energy expenditure and material used on the one hand , and maximal return of work on the other hand , all within the organismdevelopmental limits . 
Freeform and custom designs may be termed biomimetic as they resemble natural structures in these aspects , but without the constraints imposed by the organism itself . 
Despite this freedom of design , traditional engineering thinking is often limited to experience of using right angles and flat surfaces . 
In order to optimally use this new design freedom , additional tools are needed . 
The most important contributing tools for freeform design are discussed here . 
One of these is the shaping of curved and organic surfaces by the use of T-splines and more recently polygonal non-uniform rational B-spline . 
These tools allow organic designs with curved surfaces that often resemble natural structures . 
These are also critical tools in final steps of topology optimization and even true biomimetic reverse engineering structures , ultimately allowing for watertight models with curved geometries . 
Not only do these tools make custom curved shapes possible in a relevant workspace , but they are also effectively translated into geometries suitable for simulation and/or AM . 
In terms of custom design especially for implants patient-specific implants are a special category and require a particular workflow involving the processing of medical image data , the use of CAD tools and design for AM knowledge to yield a good resulting implant as discussed in . 
An example is shown in 4 where a patient-specific facial implant was produced in Ti6Al4V . 
Increases in computing power , the availability of cloud computing and the wider availability of CAE tools all led to the sharp increase in advanced and complex design capability . 
One of the first examples was the Insight Plotfrom Solidworks , which demonstrates the main load paths in a designed part , as calculated from one or more applied loads by finite element modelling . 
This was a forerunner of topology optimization tools which will be discussed in more detail in the next section . 
As mentioned above , AM releases much of the traditional limits of subtractive manufacturing allowing much wider allowed manufacturing complexity . 
This is already broadly acknowledged , and new design rules for reliable manufacturing in all forms of AM are emerging and in many cases are already mature and well-defined . 
The design for AM rules and practical issues are discussed in detail in and more recently in the context of topology optimization in . 
One major advantage of these new design tools for creating manually organic and curved surfaces and shapes is the ability to create artistic features the resemblance to biological/natural and organic structures brings a new dimension to artistic designs for end-use products . 
The use of 3D printing in arts , fashion and jewelry is growing as is shown in and artistic design is easily achieved by AM , without significantly adding to the cost of the product . 
Freeform design tools can be used to shape custom-fit sportswear or footwear , with the first fully-AM footwear being produced by Adidas Futurecraft . 
The design of this shoe is entirely latticed giving a futuristic and biomimetic visual appeal . 
These are two examples of mass production and mass customization by AM . 
Aspects of importance besides personal/custom design for fit , is the incorporation of logos or names , and the ability for the customer to take part in the design process giving them some options making their product unique . 
4 Simulation-driven biomimetic design One of the first drivers of the concepts behind simulation-driven design was from the ideas of Julius Wolff , the 19th Century Orthopedic surgeon , who first suggested that , a consequence of primary shape variations and continuous loading , or even due to loading alone , bone changes its inner architecture according to mathematical rules and , as a secondary effect and governed by the same mathematical rules , also changes its shape . 
The concept of topology optimization sprung from here from the concept that a structure can be optimized by following load paths and be modified to fit the particular mechanical requirement . 
The first industrial class software solutions incorporating the rules of design along with the ability to capture the along with the constraints to automatically generate design was released in the early 1990This was primarily the beginning of CAE simulation driving inspirational designs . 
Over the years many manufacturing constraints have also been added to shape these designs to be cognizant of the downstream manufacturing , and is relevant to different manufacturing processes . 
If the part is produced by an extrusion process , then using the extrusion constraints will generate a shape that is extrudable across the defined design space . 
Likewise , on specifying a casting constraint , the bionic shape that is generated will be free of undercuts for easy extraction from the casting molds . 
For AM , overhang constraints generate shapes that have minimal support requirement during build in a given print direction , with less horizontal sections , for example . 
There are various manufacturing constraints in AM that can be incorporated into the design optimization process and it is the incorporation of these into the topology optimization process which will create designs ready for production . 
Shown in 5 are selected examples from Altair covering a variety of parts that illustrate the power of simulation in mimicking nature for product design that outperform conventional designs and are manufacturable and lightweight . 
The first example is the HardMarque automotive piston which was designed and optimized for production by additive manufacturing in titanium the end result is reported to be 25 % lighter and equally strong compared to the original aluminium part . 
The second example from Renishaw is a seat post bracket of a mountain bike , meant to replace a cast aluminium part with additively manufactured titanium : the mass reduction was reported at 40 % . 
The third example is a case study from the aerospace industry , in particular the optimization of a mechanical hinge for an Airbus A320 by the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Innovation Works in this case a 75 % mass reduction was realized . 
The last example is a research project with Laser Zentrum Nord focusing on lightweighting of aircraft cabin brackets . 
Simulation-driven design in the context of AM refers to the use of simulation to numerically and a given space to meet some desired performance criteria under a defined set of constraints . 
This currently refers to either of topology optimization or generative design , which can often be used interchangeably in the context of AM both involve the use of simulation . 
Topology optimization refers to optimizing an existing shape or design space . 
Generative design is a broader definition of exploring a variety of possible designs within a given space with a desire to identify an optimal solution from various possible solutions meeting the same performance criteria . 
In the context of design for AM , both the approaches are aimed at creating light-weight parts which mostly contain material in areas were load is experienced and material is removed in areas which do not require it . 
This process of simulation and material-removal or addition is repeated iteratively until an optimization goal is achieved , and this iterative process may be seen analogous to the process of evolution . 
In fact , these simulations sometimes make use of genetic and evolutionary algorithms . 
Effectively , these algorithms incorporate rules like in nature to mathematically disallow weaklings to proliferate , but in an accelerated fashion using clever computational methods . 
More recently this was also described in terms of manufacturing challenges in and in terms of available software tools and their differences and limits in . 
A good example of topology optimization , applied to an extreme lightweighting requirement is the design of a titanium alloy drone frame , with larger dimensions than can be produced on typical powder bed fusion systems . 
This was produced on the large-scale laser powder bed fusion system called Aeroswift and the design done in collaboration with Altair . 
The design iteration process is shown in 6 , done in Altair Inspire . 
Another example of a topology optimized part a load bearing bracket is shown in 7 , which is taken from . 
This titanium alloy bracket was designed to replace a traditional composite bracket in an experimental vehicle for the Shell eco-challenge . 
The design process schematic here shows the original composite part , the design space , the optimized solution and the final smoothed solution , after application of connections and polyNURBS to the surfaces . 
This part was also used in a round robin test whereby the same bracket was produced at various commercial laser powder bed fusion systems and detailed analysis performed using microCT . 
The study highlighted the need for testing AM parts to ensure structural integrity . 
Another example is the design for a large bracket for the same vehicle related to the above-mentioned example . 
8 shows the optimized topology itself which is also latticed : this is a sequential process in most software packages and the area to be latticed and the lattice parameters are selected by the user . 
Latticing will be discussed in the next section and holds many advantages but must be carefully implemented in a design , due to issues such as requirement for supports inside the lattice region , and struts which are potentially too thin . 
The first is the Bugatti brake caliper which is shown in 9 , and which is currently the worldlargest functional part produced in titanium by AM . 
In this case the use of Ti6Al4V titanium alloy is especially useful for light-weighting , as this material is already strong and relatively light . 
Its use for automotive and aerospace applications is well known , but manufacturing complex designs by traditional manufacturing methods in this material is extremely challenging . 
The topology optimization result is visually impressive , the performance of this caliper has been validated in various tests and is used in production vehicles , with a 40 % mass reduction compared to the previous version made of aluminium . 
5 Cellular and lattice design Cellular structures exist in nature in numerous shapes , sizes and packing arrangements some of the most well-known examples are the beehoneycomb , wood cells and spongy bone , all of which are discussed in a book by Gibson . 
MicroCT scans of some natural cellular materials are shown in 11 . 
In fact , one of the first true observations of cellular structures in nature can be traced back to 1665 , when Robert Hooke published his observation of the cellularity in cork and suggested that the unique behavior of cork was attributable to its underlying cellular structure . 
Humans have been using cellular materials such as wood , cork and bamboo , several millennia before we realized the underlying structural basis for their interesting behaviour . 
Lattices today owe much of their origins and design selection to mathematics and crystallography , as well as following Maxwellstability criterion , which was primarily developed in the context of large engineering structures . 
The main utility of cellular or lattice structures lies in their ability to meet performance targets while enabling significant mass reduction , something that is a principle commonly embodied in nature . 
While cellular materials do tend to have lower effective material stiffness and strength properties , this reduction is often acceptable and can be tailored to the application , as well as varied locally . 
Lattices may also be useful for other purposes besides light-weighting : they have interesting thermal , acoustic properties and energy absorbing properties under compressive loading they perform a crucial protection role in nature . 
Cellular materials have also been seen as a crucial enabler for large system-level multi-functional design optimization , such as in an aircraft wing . 
The categorization of natural cellular structures is discussed in more detail in a recent review article which focuses on biomimetic design of cellular materials utilizing cellular designs in engineering systems . 
Perhaps the most commonly used , and well-known bio-inspired cellular material is the honeycomb , which has found a wide range of applications in architecture , transportation , chemical engineering and more , as compiled in a review article . 
With regard to additively manufactured cellular materials , the emphasis in the past decade has been on lattice structures , and their use for medical bone-replacement implant applications . 
In this application , the primary role of the lattice is to allow for osseointegration of bone into the implant , thereby causing better fixation . 
A recent book chapter describes the most important criteria for bone regeneration in titanium implants produced by powder bed fusion and the production of topologically designed and otherwise designed porous lattices for this application was also reviewed in . 
From an engineering standpoint , cellular materials are realized practically in commercial software packages using different approaches . 
Traditional CAD software uses mesh-based representation , but recent developments in software are exploring the use of volumetric object representation to generate surfaces , and in at least one case , the use of implicit modeling via the definition of fields that then generate cellular structures . 
Mesh-based approaches can generate visually impressive lattices which conform well to the original surface design , and is relatively easily implemented for complex part geometries . 
The volumetric object representation approach allows for the user to select a unit cell from a wider variety of cellular designs . 
The repeated unit cell approach also allows relatively easy prediction of mechanical properties of the structure , easing the design process . 
A series of unit cells and corresponding repeated lattice structures are shown in 12 . 
These are all designed with the same total density , but the different designs result in different minimum feature thickness and pore sizes . 
The first four are strut-based and the next four are minimal surface designs . 
The latter are found in nature , and have been shown to have good properties for bone implant applications . 
These minimal surfaces are sheet-based designs which are often self-supporting and tend to have zero average curvature at every point on the surface , which makes for a more even distribution of stresses within these structures . 
Despite the growing prevalence of design software capable of generating cellular structure designs , it is not always apparent what the best unit cell for a specific application is and this becomes even more challenging in the context of multi-functional design . 
It is in such a context that biomimetic design can play a key role , in helping develop structure-function relationships based on observations of cellular materials in nature , and using these to guide selection of cellular materials . 
Natural cellular materials span the range of parameter space used in design , from beam or strut-based materials to surface based ones , including structures that combine both types , as shown in 13 . 
These cellular materials occur in nature both internal to a form , as well as externally on the surface . 
The main application of lattice structures , which has resulted in considerable research efforts , is their use in medical implants . 
For this application the pore sizes required are typically small , requiring small feature sizes in general . 
Other applications than medical , such as in light-weight structures for aerospace or automotive parts , might prefer thicker lattices to focus on mechanical reliability and strength . 
Experimental work with lattices with thick struts show excellent strength properties as shown in for 50 % density Ti6Al4V lattices of two strut-based designs . 
Simple strut-based lattice designs can be classified according to the Maxwell criterion as either bending-dominated or stretch-dominated as illustrated schematically and by a few examples in 14 . 
The Maxwell criterion for simple strut-based 3D structures is : M = b 3j + 6 Where b = the number of struts , and j = the number of joints When M < 0 the structure is bending-dominated When M 0 the structure is stretch-dominated and When M > 0 the structure is over-rigid Bending-dominated refers to the struts which tend to bend under compression of the lattice resulting in shear failure , while stretch-dominated structures are stiffer and fail in a layer-by-layer mechanism . 
These failure modes have been observed in relatively thick-strut lattices and imaged by microCT in their initial failure locations . 
The mechanical response of lattice structures in general follows a linear elastic response up to the first point of buckling or failure , followed by a plateau region , followed by final densification . 
This is shown in the example in 15 , which also shows why cellular materials are useful for energy absorption as they can handle significant yielding without catastrophic failure , under most circumstances . 
A lattice structure can be approximated as an open-cell foam , with effective elastic modulus E of the lattice related to the density of the structure and the elastic modulus of the bulk material - solid as follows : E = 2 E s o l i d s o l i d 2 In this relationship , the constant depends on the manufacturing accuracy and material properties and varies between 0.1 and 4 but is a constant for a specific material and process . 
What this relationship shows is that the effective elastic modulus can be controlled by the density alone this means that a lattice with unit cell design of 50 % density may use any unit cell size as long as the total space filled contains at least six unit cells in each direction then the material stiffness will be the same . 
This means lattices with many thin struts might perform the same as lattices with less thick struts , an interesting design aspect which can be varied by application requirement . 
It is also important to note that the exponent refers to ideal bending-dominated lattice while an ideal stretch-dominated lattice has exponent This is illustrated in 16 , for a range of lattice types clearly this exponent may vary somewhat depending on the lattice design selected . 
Besides the relationships mentioned above , lattice designs must also be considered relative to manufacturing limits . 
For example , sheet-based designs can typically print without supports , and strut-based designs can print without supports up to a certain strut length for horizontal struts . 
Therefore , manufacturing constraints are imposed on the design possibilities . 
The most important limits are the minimum feature size , which , in practice , is limited not only by the powder size and laser spot size , but also by the 3D model slicing accuracy and the resulting hatch and contour scanning employed . 
For example , in a recent study of thin-strut lattices , the standard processing parameters resulted in the inability to produce struts varying gradually from 0.2 to 0.4 mm . 
Here , different designs were produced with approximately the same strut dimensions despite differences in design . 
These thin-strut lattices also have relatively large surface roughness values compared to the strut thickness , which understandably affects the mechanical properties more than would be expected for a thicker-strut version . 
In this above-mentioned study the experimental elastic modulus values were significantly lower than predicted mostly attributed to surface roughness and irregularity which creates stress concentrations in notches and in locations of very thin wall thickness . 
Effectively for a metal laser powder bed fusion system with about 100 spot size , the minimum reliable wall thickness should be 0.3-0.4 mm if no special precautions or optimization for strut manufacturing is done to enhance the manufacturability . 
The next section discusses material properties and will specifically mention limits with regards to lattice manufacturability . 
6 Material properties of AM biomimetic parts Biomimetic-designed and produced parts are visually so vastly different from traditional manufactured parts , that it causes mistrust and resistance to acceptance of this new technology , especially by engineers . 
In some ways this is to be expected , as AM has a history of over-hype and under-delivery in the past . 
In the qualification process , mechanical properties of the optimized process can be tested and validated as demonstrated for Ti6Al4V in . 
In order to obtain defect-free and accurately produced parts , X-ray tomography can be used as outlined in . 
The specific process parameters which combine to create an object in AM all have an influence on the subsequent material properties and the manufacturing process of the object as a whole . 
This is true not only for fully dense objects , but also for complex or lattice design with biomimetic features such as custom or complex shapes , inner structures or surface modifications . 
In this case , material properties and the properties of i.e . 
single building blocks and joints between them also influence the properties of the LPBF object . 
Defects and flaws such as porosity occurs in the LPBF process due to various reasons and this can influence the mechanical properties of the final parts . 
There are many process parameters the laser power , laser spot size and scanning speed , hatch distance , material properties , powder particle size distribution and powder layer thickness , the strategy , design and orientation of the 3D part and its supports , the scanning and building strategy , etc . 
which all may influence the molten pool size , further solidification , microstructural grain growth and eventually the mechanical properties , lifetime and performance of LPBF parts . 
The details of the AM process are discussed in the comprehensive review paper . 
It is already well known that variation of process parameters may influence the formation of porosity and may lead to extensive flaws and build imperfections , as is shown for example in a round robin test recently . 
This highlights the need for process optimization . 
Other properties such as corrosion are also strongly affected by processing conditions and are important for biomimetic applications , especially medical applications . 
For example , it was shown that a higher corrosion resistance of Co-Cr dental alloy was obtained by Selective Laser Melting in comparison with the Selective Laser Sintering process , due to a passive oxide protecting layer which formed on the surface of the SLM sample . 
Takaichi found that metal elution from the LPBF dental implants was smaller than that of the as-cast Co-Cr alloy . 
Thus , it could be said that LPBF materials have superior corrosion properties . 
However , process-parameters can influence the corrosion behavior of samples produced with different process-parameters . 
It is already known that the level of microporosity affects the corrosion behavior as shown in . 
Micro-segregation of elements under specific LPBF process-parameters can occur causing different corrosion behavior at materials processed under different parameters . 
Since melt pool boundaries may differ in corrosion resistance compared to the center of the meltpool , more melt pool boundaries imply different corrosion resistance of LPBF material . 
These statements have to be taken into account especially for smart AM advanced biodegradable implants that should degrade with spatial and temporal controllability to meet the requirements of different bone regeneration stages . 
LPBF samples have varying surface roughness on side , top and bottom surfaces . 
Attached powder particles can be eliminated by post-process mechanical or chemical procedures . 
However , for LPBF parts with complex shapes and fine features or lattice structures , full powder evacuation and targeted accuracy and roughness values can be quite difficult to obtain . 
The surface roughness is dependent on the building and scanning strategy , material properties , powder size , layer thickness , etc . 
This can influence not only the mechanical properties but also the biological response of bone cells or soft tissues when such an object is implanted . 
Moreover , there is currently no general approach and agreement about preferred roughness values or surface micron-scale features and pore size for effective bone cell growth and functioning of implants . 
For lattice structures , the geometrical characteristics of unit cells , the building direction , overhang angles , hatch and contour scanning strategy may all influence the obtained roughness in the scaffolds and may cause deviations from designed sizes . 
For example , in du Plessis , the elemental cubic lattice was designed with a total 15 mm width , 0.75 mm strut thickness and 8 struts across one direction in total , resulting in 1.28 mm distance between struts and total 65 % porosity . 
One set of samples was built at standard process-parameters recommended for EOS Ti6Al4V in vertical direction , other ones at 45angle . 
Samples were heat-treated for stress-relieving as indicated in . 
The differences in strut thickness , roughness and microstructure is clearly visible by cross-sections and also different columnar prior beta-grain orientations are clearly present . 
Samples that were produced at 45 degrees , had 25 % lower ultimate compression strength in comparison with vertical samples . 
Bending and stretch-dominated lattices fail respectively in shear and layer-by-layer failure modes , and this might depend somewhat on the material ductility . 
For a brittle material , shear failure is not desirable and layer-by-layer can be much preferred and even might act as protective mechanism . 
The layer-by-layer mechanism is more predictable as it is known where the next failure will occur . 
In general , manufacturing imperfections might affect thin features more than thick features , hence thin struts should be thickened or well-designed with sufficient safety margin . 
The obtained texturization in LPBF materials - grain and sub-grain sizes - depend on the process-parameters used and scanning strategy in LPBF materials as shown by . 
The microstructure of LPBF solid samples and their mechanical properties , fracture and fatigue behavior have some peculiarities in as-built and heat-treated AM parts , which have been widely studied . 
For example , the columnar boundaries of prior beta-phase were observed in as-built Ti6Al4V ELI specimens and remain even after heat treatment of 950 for 2 hours . 
Anisotropy in AM is often mentioned . 
For example , the mechanical properties of LPBF Ti6Al4V ELI was found to be strongly anisotropic where three-point bending fatigue tests were used with parts produced in different orientations . 
The crack propagation rate and fatigue life of as-built and heat-treated samples correlated with column boundaries and orientation of the layers , i.e . 
correlated with the building direction . 
For static tensile tests , lower ductility was observed experimentally for the horizontal specimens in comparison with vertical samples this could be attributed to long prior beta-grain boundaries in Ti6Al4V which grow in the build direction and are hence perpendicular to the loading direction in horizontal specimens . 
As it was noted in , the orientation dependency of the ductility in AM is not yet clear and further in-depth investigations need to be done . 
Mechanical properties are dependent on building and scanning strategies and these vary for different materials . 
For example , LPBF 316 L stainless steel had maximum strength and Youngmodulus under a 45 degree offset between the layer and loading direction , whereas AlSi10Mg revealed the lowest strength in this case . 
In samples manufactured by LPBF from a nickel-based alloy , strong crystallographic texture resulting in anisotropic properties was found in creep behavior : specimens with loading parallel to the building direction were superior compared to specimens with loading axis normal to the building direction . 
The Young 's modulus determined in measurements at room and elevated temperature was different during tensile testing parallel or perpendicular to the building direction . 
The building direction and laser scanning direction / scanning strategy are important for the mechanical integrity and this adds complexity to the optimal processing protocol for parts of complex shape . 
Material type , particle size distribution and particle shape , process-parameters , protective atmosphere , building and scanning strategies , post-processing , etc . 
should all be optimized according to the specific LPBF process so that biomimetic objects can be produced with the desired properties . 
Once material properties and structural integrity have been assessed , the parts produced can be trusted , especially when suitable design safety margins have been incorporated . 
There are some general suggested guidelines based on the experiences of the authors which can be used in addition to ensure safety and reliability of biomimetic parts in real world applications : 1 For lattices , thin struts might contain micro-porosity , rough surfaces and manufacturing imperfections which affect the mechanical properties sometimes more strongly than thicker features . 
It was found that the cyclic response of lattices depend not only on the type of bulk material , but also on the roughness of the outer surface of the struts and the distribution of the micro-pores inside the struts which can both affect the crack initiation and crack propagation . 
Post processing chemical cleaning to decrease strut roughness can be used to minimize this . 
The accuracy of various AM techniques are different since different laser spot size , powder layer thickness , process-parameters as well as powder material are used . 
Therefore , for a particular purpose where mechanical properties are critical , AM lattices should be tested stringently . 
To improve mechanical performance of lattice structures for load bearing applications they must be well-designed . 
Van Bael showed that stiffness and compressive strength of lattice structures correlate well with volume fraction . 
Contuzzi proposed to use solid reinforcements in fine lattice structures that increase load carrying capability of the structure almost linearly with the number of the reinforcements . 
Bobbert proposed to use in these applications continuous sheet-based porous structures because they are expected to be less sensitive to such imperfections than beam-based porous structures , to improve fatigue resistance . 
2 For lattices , selecting lattice parameters to ensure no supports are required on the lattice or inside the lattice area is critical . 
Here , strut angles and/or length is important . 
3 For irregular geometries from topology optimization and freeform design , it is advisable to perform build-simulation to ensure no local heat accumulation occurs which might lead to residual stress and warping . 
In this process , the optimal build angle and supports should be selected . 
4 Residual stress can be minimized by design as mentioned above , and can be further improved by stress-relief heat treatment a relatively simple recommended solution . 
Heat treatment can have a decisive role on higher ductility and load bearing capacity of lattice structures and might increase fatigue life . 
5 Special attention must be given to the loading direction during use , because anisotropic mechanical properties of LPBF objects exists . 
This anisotropy might not only result from the material and its specific microstructure , but also from scanning and building strategies used for LPBF manufacturing , which might vary with different systems . 
Lattice structures built in different directions have non-identical mechanical properties . 
7 Challenges in biomimetic AM Despite all the potential for biomimicry in AM in its various forms , there are some challenges to its practical implementation . 
Most importantly , all forms of biomimetic design for AM involves complexity in various forms not previously encountered . 
While AM relaxes the traditional manufacturing rules , not any geometry or structure can be produced easily or reliably . 
Due to the complexity of design , design for AM becomes even more crucial to ensure manufacturability and might involve re-design in cases of difficult geometries . 
Metal AM and its limits in general are discussed in more detail in . 
AM is still a relatively new manufacturing process which requires process optimization and quality control to ensure accuracy and reliability . 
This requirement is critically important for parts with complex geometries which include curved surfaces , thin connecting features , hidden features and lattice structures . 
There are also many varieties of AM with different trade names , processes and differences in quality obtained . 
This quality refers in particular to material density and process induced pores , inherent process surface roughness , build errors such as uneven powder spreading or scan track errors leading to critical flaws , residual stresses and associated warping and cracking and microstructural inhomogeneity . 
A major limitation is the minimum feature size for the AM system used . 
Some additional limitations are placed on the part designs , most notably the build angles . 
All down-facing surfaces have typically rougher surfaces than upwards-facing surfaces , thin angled features suffer from stair-step effects , and small angles require supports . 
Support removal is not a simple process : this post-processing is time consuming and may also affect the dimensional accuracy and quality of the resulting part . 
When supports are needed inside a complex part , these supports might not be physically removable at all as shown in the example in 18 . 
In this figure , two topology-optimized bracket designs were almost entirely latticed but the build process required incorporation of supports also inside the lattice region . 
Removing supports from lattice regions on the exterior can cause damage to the lattice struts , and removing them from inside the lattice region is entirely impossible . 
In this case , the brackets still met the mass target despite internal supports , but the aesthetic value is not as visually impressive as could have been achieved by appropriate design to eliminate supports . 
Detailed inspection of these complex parts ensures their structural integrity and accuracy of production . 
Due to the expense involved in AM , non-destructive tools are especially useful to analyze parts without destroying them : the most widely used are X-ray techniques such as 2D digital radiography and 3D micro-computed tomography . 
Due to the complexity of the parts 2D X-ray images are difficult to interpret and smaller flaws which are typical to AM may be missed . 
As a result , microCT is often the preferred method of choice . 
This technique works by acquisition of X-ray absorption images from many angles around the object , followed by reconstruction to produce a 3D representation of the object , including its interior . 
It is also known as X-ray tomography , CT scanning or X-ray microscopy . 
The most important issues that can be identified by microCT and which are relevant to biomimetic AM are : - Powder can get stuck in complex areas , especially inside lattices , and when heat-treated they become stuck . 
This adds weight and might be unsafe . 
- Rough surfaces which depend on build angle might affect mechanical properties , with rough surfaces in inaccessible areas being unable to be processed . 
Roughness can be measured quantitatively or assessed visually . 
- Manufacturing flaws such as porosity might also occur despite process parameter optimization and this may affect the mechanical properties . 
It is important to note here that process parameter optimization prior to building a part can limit process-induced porosity and this microporosity is expected to be the same in a test coupon than in a complex part . 
- Residual stress can not directly be seen in microCT images but can be seen indirectly in the form of warping and cracks . 
Unnoticed residual stress in a part might affect its mechanical properties . 
Stress-relief heat treatment is therefore highly recommended . 
The above issues can be partially improved or solved by using AM simulations to highlight where thermal hotspots might be formed . 
A change in the build angle or design itself can contribute to eliminate these . 
Changing the lattice design or parameters can improve the requirement for supports and self-supporting lattice designs can be selected in some cases . 
Besides build orientation planning and simulation , the manufacturing process can be optimized to ensure high quality production on test cubes , which can be subjected to detailed analysis by sectioning , or preferably by microCT . 
When using microCT , however , it is also important to realize that while small porosity is acceptable when well distributed , only major flaws or those with specific location-specific clustering are important , as well as those in critical regions of the part . 
Optimization of processes using test cubes and microCT may assist in identifying the root cause of some types of defects which allows to improve the process . 
Simulations and experimental work done on lattice structures with artificially induced porosity in individual struts showed that this did not affect the yield strength of the lattice for up to 0.5 mm pores . 
8 New trends in biomimetic AM This section mentions some current interesting trends in biomimetic design for AM , with new developments expected in the next few years as the techniques are refined and new tools become available . 
The first worth mentioning is that most topology optimization software at present operates on the topology itself and subsequently certain areas can be selected for latticing , i.e . 
the latticing is not part of the simulation-driven design process . 
This latticing is incorporated into the simulation-driven design process and will find application especially in light-weighting applications . 
The other useful development is the optimization of repeated lattices gradient lattices and variations of strut thickness or unit cell size across a part , and conformal lattices to the surfaces of a part . 
In other words , the lattice is not simply cut off on the edge of the part but unit cells are stretched to fit the surface topology . 
An example hereof is shown in 21 where the lattice is conformal to two opposing surfaces and the lattice density varies to allow denser lattice in areas where simulations show higher stress will be experienced . 
Recent research approaches for cellular material design have included the development of multi-scale optimization approaches as described by Osanov and Guest and Cadman . 
In this approach , the unit cell domain is discretized into elements which are then themselves optimized using topology optimization methods , similar to discussions in the previous section . 
A unit cell so designed can then be used to compute effective properties , after which inverse homogenization is used to upscale the cellular geometry to the level of the larger structure . 
These ideas have been recently extended to multi-material cellular structure optimization . 
Cellular automata methods have also been developed to design materials and microstructures , and machine learning methods are beginning to be applied to materials design . 
Because of the very complex shapes of the parts having a biomimetic or bionic design , it is often necessary to use support structures for overhanging areas . 
This can be a big problem in the post processing of these parts for removing the supports and surface finishing . 
On the other hand , internal complexity and small features are limited in this process , since with constant preheating of each layer to a high temperature , the powder is partially sintered and later can not be removed from the manufactured part . 
There are also quite serious limitations on materials for EBM technology . 
Also recently , companies such as EOS and Velo3D have improved their softwares , scanning strategies and process control parameters , which allowed to realize designs with overhangs lower than 15and large inner diameters without supports . 
These developments are all very promising for the realization of increasingly complex biomimetic designs with improved structural integrity and surface quality . 
An emerging trend is the development of software packages incorporating the entire workflow for advanced design for AM , including freeform design , topology optimization , latticing and more recently also build simulation and even support generation and slicing for build preparation . 
When all this is combined in one workspace the entire design process is simplified and this allows more frequent and improved biomimetic designs to be realized in practice . 
The development of standards for AM and non-destructive testing in AM is emerging as an important aspect in the qualification of processes and ensuring reliability in AM processes . 
This is especially applicable to biomimetic designs and it holds the most advantage in optimizing process parameters prior to building complex parts - using microCT test methods . 
Inspecting complex parts is also valuable in critical parts such as for aerospace , and microCT is the best method to do this . 
It is worth mentioning that besides complex part inspections , which are limited in resolution by field of view , it is becoming standard practice to inspect witness specimens of smaller diameter built alongside complex parts . 
This allows for high resolution CT analysis with defects found in these specimens being indicative of problems encountered during the build . 
Something that is becoming increasingly popular for improving part density is the use of hot isostatic pressing , especially for additively-manufactured metal parts for aerospace it is a requirement that all parts are HIPped . 
The HIP process closes pores and improves the microstructure , but it is important to realize that not all pores are necessarily closed by HIP : it has been shown that pores connected to the surface do not close properly , and is detectable by microCT . 
The important point is that HIP should not be used as a blind solution its performance especially in thin walled parts should be checked . 
In general , the use of biomimetic AM is growing at a very fast rate , with practical engineering applications emerging almost daily . 
This is driven by the maturation of metal powder bed fusion AM , the development of appropriate software tools , and the huge interest from companies in investing in a technology with clear potential to disrupt various industries . 
The key to disrupting existing products is in significant advantages in the new design which is possible by AM and biomimicry is key to unlocking this potential . 
Besides aesthetic appeal , actual light-weight advantage is likely the biggest drawcard in automotive and aerospace industries . 
In other industries the combination of multiple parts into one might be a significant advantage and it is expected that the multi-functionality of designs might be one of the big future growth areas . 
9 Conclusions It is clear that biomimicry in AM allows complex functional designs and various tools are currently available to easily achieve such designs . 
Biomimetic designs are therefore both beautiful and functional . 
Despite the high possible complexity , some design for AM rules have emerged which improve the manufacturability and reliability of these types of parts and these should be incorporated into the design process . 
It is especially important that process parameters are optimized to ensure structural integrity and ensure high quality manufacturing , as manufacturing errors might affect these parts more than traditional parts this requires an additional safety factor to be built into designs , and inspection is critical . 
Post-processing of parts is also a challenge , and the options are limited therefore depending on the application the complexity of the design might need to be constrained to ensure all surfaces are accessible by required post-processing techniques . 
One of the most widely used applications of biomimetic design in AM is light-weighting , but many other opportunities exist including parts customized for acoustic , thermal , optical or other applications , especially in combination with surface modification techniques . 
Most importantly , all examples in this work clearly demonstrate that biomimetic designs can be trusted and should be used more widely . 
Biomimetic designs are crucial for fully unlocking the power of metal AM in particular . 
In conclusion , biomimicry in AM has been shown to be possible in various ways , with the most accessible tools currently being freeform design and simulation-driven design . 
These tools allow complex forms to be created which often resemble natural structures , and the design engineer may incorporate from naturein this design process . 
For example , in simulation-driven design , various outcomes are possible and selection of the design outcome most similar to a biological structure is most likely the best solution . 
The greatest future potential for biomimicry in AM lies in incorporating real biological input in some ways in the design process and here biological materials science is crucial in providing from naturewhich can be incorporated easily . 
It is not only in the design process where biomimicry can be employed . 
The entire process of 3D printing may follow biological principles , including sustainability . 
Biomimetic design therefore forms part of and drives the bio-industrial revolution which will become known as Industry 5.0 .

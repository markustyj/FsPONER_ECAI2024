Nevertheless O
, O
the O
main O

experience O
is O
the O
proposed O
redesign O
approach O
for O

. O


The O
proposed O
approach O
is O
general O
, O
well O
structured O
, O
and O
detailed O
enough O
to O
be S-MATE
immedialtely O
applicable O
at O
industrial S-APPL
level O
, O
but O
it O
needs O
further O
testing S-CHAR
on O
different O

to O
prove O
the O

. O


An O

exploiting O
AM B-MANP
technologies E-MANP
is O
presented O
and O
validated O
in O

In O
a O
further O
development O
of O
their O
approach O
, O
the O
authors O
have O
recently O
addressed O
the O

problem O
of O
detecting O
the O
possible O

Potentially O
, O
when O
dealing O
with O
part B-CONPRI

, O
the O

may O
consider O
the O
need O
of O

The O
need O
to O
increase O
the O
number O
of O

in O
a O

fabricated S-CONPRI
by O

may O
be S-MATE
due O
to O
many O
reasons O
: O
printability S-PARA
, O
productivity S-CONPRI
, O
functionality O
, O

, O
and O

Printability S-PARA
is O
actually O
the O
main O
reason O
being O

to O
the O
limited O

In O
the O

which O
means O
that O
this O
ceramic S-MATE
facilitates O

The O
excellent O
mechanical B-CONPRI
properties E-CONPRI

. O


The O
most O
used O
in O
dental B-MANP
ceramics I-MANP

is O
based O
on O
milling S-MANP
of O
pre-sintered S-PRO

, O
through O
a O

SM S-MATE

extensively O
used O
in O
dentistry S-APPL
for O
the O
production S-MANP
of O
dental B-MACEQ
pieces E-MACEQ
such O
as S-MATE
crowns O
and O

. O


SM S-MATE
technology O
allows O
the O
processing O
of O
materials S-CONPRI
, O
which O
would O
otherwise O
be S-MATE
difficult O
to O
manipulate O
. O


This O
way O
, O
the O
exhaustive O
artisanal O
production S-MANP
techniques O
are O
decreased O
or O
even O
eliminated O
, O
thus O
allowing O
the O
dental S-APPL

to O
enhance O
the O
creative O
component S-MACEQ
of O
his O

SM S-MATE
is O
a O
well-established O
technology S-CONPRI
which O
has O
the O
advantage O
of O
using O
intrinsically O
homogeneous B-MATE
materials E-MATE
which O
are O
unaffected O
by O

Furthermore O
, O
it O
requires O
low O
post-processing S-CONPRI
and O
the O
costs O
regarding O
the O
involved O
equipment S-MACEQ
are O
relatively O
reduced O
. O


However O
, O
this O
is O
a O
wasteful O
process S-CONPRI
because O
the O

is O
milled S-MANP

3D B-MANP

involves O
processing O
methodologies O
that O
are O
capable O
of O

The O

is O
virtually O
sliced O
into O
several O
two-dimensional S-CONPRI

Then O
, O
an O
AM B-MACEQ
machine E-MACEQ
generates O
the O
tool-path S-PARA
along O
the O

. O


Each O

one O
on O
top O
of O
the O
other O
, O
consecutively O
, O
forming S-MANP
a O

Ceramics S-MATE
present O
a O
higher O

to O
thermal O
shook O
and O
lower O
sintrerability S-PRO

Thus O

The O

Usually O
in O

BJ S-MANP
presents O
several O
advantages O
, O
such O
as S-MATE
the O
ability O

use O
a O

of O
materials S-CONPRI
as S-MATE
well O

a O
large O

, O
being O
generally O
a O
fast O
printing B-MANP

. O


The O
drawbacks O
of O
this O
technology S-CONPRI
are O
mainly O
related O
to O
the O
high O
porosity S-PRO
and O
consequent O
low O
mechanical B-CONPRI
properties E-CONPRI
of O
the O
printed O
pieces O
. O


This O
is O
due O
to O
factors O
such O
as S-MATE
the O
high O
friction S-CONPRI
within O
the O
powder B-MATE
particles E-MATE
, O
their O
random O
agglomeration O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
an O
external O
force S-CONPRI
to O
compress O
the O
powder S-MATE
and O
improve O
packaging O
. O


The O
flowability O
and O
spreadability O
of O
powders S-MATE
are O
especially O
important O
for O
BJ S-MANP
. O


Using O
powders S-MATE
with O
large O
particle S-CONPRI
sizes O
can O
enhance O
the O
flowability O
, O
however O
it O
may O
jeopardize O
the O
sinterability S-PRO
and O
densification B-PRO
behaviour E-PRO
after O
printing O
. O


Contrarily O
, O
very O
fine O
particle S-CONPRI
size O
may O
lead S-MATE
to O
considerable O
agglomeration O
and O
reduced O
flowability O
. O


Since O
after O
sintering S-MANP
, O
the O
pieces O
density S-PRO
rarely O
exceeds O
50 O
% O
of O
the O
theoretical S-CONPRI

, O
this O
technology S-CONPRI
seems O
not O
to O
be S-MATE
suitable O
for O

In O
order O
to O
overcome O
this O
issue O
, O
the O

One O
of O
the O
critical O
issues O
in O
orthopaedic S-APPL
regenerative O
medicine S-CONPRI
is O
the O
design S-FEAT
of O
bone B-BIOP
scaffolds E-BIOP
and O
implants S-APPL
that O
replicate O
the O
biomechanical B-PRO
properties E-PRO
of O
the O
host B-BIOP
bones E-BIOP
. O


Porous B-MATE
metals E-MATE
have O
found O
themselves O
to O
be S-MATE
suitable O
candidates O
for O
repairing O
or O
replacing O
the O
damaged B-PRO
bones E-PRO
since O
their O
stiffness S-PRO
and O
porosity S-PRO
can O
be S-MATE
adjusted O
on O
demands O
. O


Another O
advantage O
of O
porous B-MATE
metals E-MATE
lies O
in O
their O
open O
space O
for O
the O
in-growth O
of O
bone S-BIOP

, O
hence O
accelerating O
the O
osseointegration S-PRO

The O

porous B-MATE

been O
extensively O

however O
only O
limited O

over O
the O

can O
be S-MATE
achieved O
by O
the O
conventional O
processes S-CONPRI

Recent O
advances O
in O
additive B-MANP

have O
provided O
unprecedented O
opportunities O
for O
producing O
complex B-CONPRI
structures E-CONPRI
to O
meet O
the O
increasing O

. O


At O
the O

have O
been O

Thus O

Bone S-BIOP

a O

i.e. O
, O
the O

This O
unique O
feature S-FEAT
of O
bone S-BIOP
underpins O
its O
ability O
to O
remodel O
itself O
to O
repair O

However O
, O
when O
a O
bone B-BIOP
defect E-BIOP
exceeds O
a O
critical O
non-healable B-PARA
size E-PARA
, O
external O
intervention O
is O
required O
to O
supplement O

if O
the O

Despite O

, O
repair O
of O
such O
a O
critical-sized O

still O
remains O
a O
challenge O
. O


The O
optimal O
choice O
is O
to O
use O
autograft S-BIOP

However O
, O
harvesting O
autograft B-BIOP
tissue E-BIOP
creates O
the O
morbidity O
associated O
with O
a O

. O


The O
insufficiencies O
of O
application O
of O
autograft S-BIOP
and O
allograft B-MATE

have O
led S-APPL
to O
greater O
research S-CONPRI
efforts O
to O
identify O
biomimetic B-MATE
materials E-MATE
and O
structures O
that O
are O
suitable O
for O
skeletal O

without O
the O
inherent O

. O


Metals S-MATE

have O
a O
long O
history O
of O
application O
as S-MATE

Among O
them O
, O
the O
use O
of O
stainless B-MATE
steels E-MATE
, O
cobalt S-MATE
based O
alloys S-MATE

and O
titanium S-MATE

well O

due O
to O
their O
good O
biocompatibility S-PRO
, O
satisfactory O
mechanical B-PRO

and O
superior O
corrosion B-CONPRI

. O


However O
, O
implants S-APPL
made O
of O
these O
materials S-CONPRI
are O
usually O
much O
stiffer O
than O
natural O
bones O
, O
leading O
to O

shielding E-PRO
- O
a O
major O
source S-APPL
for O
bone B-CONPRI

and O
eventual O

of O
such O
implants S-APPL
. O


Cortical B-MATE
bone E-MATE
has O
elastic B-PRO
moduli E-PRO
ranging O
from O
3 O
to O
30 O
GPa S-PRO
, O
while O
trabecular O
or O
cancellous B-BIOP
bone E-BIOP
has O
significantly O
lower O
elastic B-PRO
moduli E-PRO
of O
0.02GPa O
. O


Most O
current O
implant S-APPL
materials O
have O
much O
higher O
moduli O
than O
those O
of O

, O
e.g. O
, O
Ti6Al4V S-MATE

a O

GPa S-PRO
and O
CoCrMo B-MATE

have O
a O
modulus O

Therefore O
, O

the O
bone-implant B-FEAT

the O

An O

to O

Although O

only O

the O

Requirements O
for O
the O
design S-FEAT
of O
orthopaedic B-APPL
implants E-APPL
A O
successful O
porous B-APPL
metallic I-APPL
implant E-APPL
would O
restore O
the O
function O
of O
bone S-BIOP
and O
promote O
regeneration S-CONPRI
of O
bone S-BIOP
tissue O
at O
the O
damaged O
site O
. O


An O
ideal O
bone B-BIOP
scaffold E-BIOP
should O
possess O
the O
following O
characteristics O
: O
biocompatibility S-PRO
; O
suitable O
surface S-CONPRI
for O
cell B-FEAT
attachment E-FEAT
, O
proliferation O
and O
differentiation O
; O
highly O
porous S-PRO
with O
an O

network O
for O
cell B-CONPRI
ingrowth E-CONPRI
and O
transport S-CHAR
of O
nutrients O
and O
metabolic B-CONPRI
waste E-CONPRI
; O
mechanical B-CONPRI
properties E-CONPRI
to O
match O
the O
requirements O
of O
the O
surrounding O
tissues O
to O
reduce O
or O
eliminate O
stress B-PRO
shielding E-PRO
, O
and O
to O
meet O
anatomic O
loading O
requirements O
to O
avoid O
mechanical B-PRO
failure E-PRO
. O


Porous B-MATE
metals E-MATE
are O
implanted S-MANP
to O
repair O
bone B-BIOP
defects E-BIOP
of O
critical O
size O
and O
, O
in O
most O
cases O
, O
serve O
as S-MATE
load-bearing O
devices O
. O


Bone S-BIOP
is O
usually O
anisotropic S-PRO
with O
different O
stiffness S-PRO
and O
strength S-PRO
in O
different O
directions O
, O
but O
normally O
there O
are O
no O
extremely O
weak O
directions O
. O


Therefore O
, O
suitable O
porous B-MATE
metals E-MATE
will O
approximate O
the O
stiffness S-PRO
of O
surrounding O
bones O
, O
making O
them O
effective O
for O
load O

and O
alleviating O
the O
stress B-PRO

effect O
. O


The O
key O
characteristics O
to O
design S-FEAT
porous O
metallic S-MATE
implants S-APPL
include O
the O
careful O
selection O
of O
porosity S-PRO
, O
pore B-PARA
size E-PARA
, O
and O
pore S-PRO
interconnectivity O
, O
aiming O
to O
achieve O
satisfactory O
clinical O
outcomes O
. O


These O
structural O
features O
have O
a O
profound O
effect O
on O
mechanical B-CONPRI
properties E-CONPRI
and O
biological O
performance S-CONPRI
of O
the O
metallic S-MATE
implants S-APPL
. O


Bone B-CONPRI
regeneration E-CONPRI
in O
porous B-APPL
implants E-APPL
in O
vivo O
involves O
recruitment O
and O
penetration S-CONPRI
of O
cells S-APPL
from O
the O
surrounding O
bone S-BIOP
tissue O
and O
vascularization S-CONPRI
. O


Higher O
porosity S-PRO
may O
facilitate O
these O
processes S-CONPRI
and O
benefit O
the O
bone B-CONPRI
ingrowth E-CONPRI
. O


For O
instance O
, O
more O
bone B-CONPRI
ingrowth E-CONPRI
was O
found O
in O
porous S-PRO
titanium O
coatings S-APPL
of O
higher O
porosity S-PRO
after O
the O
implants S-APPL
were O
placed O
into O
a O
canine B-APPL
model E-APPL
for O
8 O
weeks O
. O


Similarly O
, O
bone B-CONPRI

was O
shown O
to O
be S-MATE
deeper O
and O
greater O
in O
porous S-PRO

of O
higher O
porosity S-PRO
. O


The O
influence O
of O
pore B-PARA
size E-PARA
on O
the O
bone B-CONPRI
ingrowth E-CONPRI
is O
still O
controversial O
in O
literature O
. O


The O
optimal O
pore B-PARA

for O
mineralized O
bone B-CONPRI

is O
claimed O
to O
be S-MATE

They O
implanted S-MANP
triangle-shaped O
titanium B-APPL

with O
pore B-PARA

ranging O
from O
50 O

125 O
into O
rabbit O

found O
that O
there O
was O
no O
clear O
lower O
limit S-CONPRI
of O

Recently O

the O
feasibility S-CONPRI
of O
early O
bone B-CONPRI

a O
predominantly O
microporous S-PRO
Ti O
coating S-APPL

the O
compact S-MANP

found O
that O
new O

in O
micropores O

less O
than O
10 O
Large O
pores S-PRO
are O
believed O
to O
favour O
vascularization S-CONPRI

Bai O
suggested O
an O
upper O
limit S-CONPRI
of O
pore B-PARA
size E-PARA
for O
vascularization S-CONPRI
, O
400 O
beyond O
which O
no O
significant O
difference O
was O
observed O
with O
increasing O
pore B-PARA

. O


Kuboki O
found O
that O

scaffolds S-FEAT
demonstrated O
significantly O
higher O
bone B-CONPRI

. O


In O
addition O
to O
vascularization S-CONPRI
, O
specific O
surface B-PARA
area E-PARA
of O
scaffolds S-FEAT
is O
another O
essential O
factor O
with O
respect O
to O
fixation O
ability O
. O


Scaffolds S-FEAT
with O
smaller O
pores S-PRO
are O
considered O
to O
have O
larger O
surface B-PARA
area E-PARA
and O
therefore O
more O
space O
for O
bone B-CONPRI
tissue I-CONPRI
ingrowth E-CONPRI
. O


Another O
important O
feature S-FEAT
of O
bone B-APPL
implants E-APPL
is O
the O
permeability S-PRO
of O
the O
porous B-MATE
metal E-MATE
since O
the O
transportation O
of O
cells S-APPL
, O
nutrients O
and O
growth O
factors O
require O
the O
flow O
of O
blood O
through O
the O
porous B-FEAT
scaffolds E-FEAT
. O


In O
simple S-MANP
terms O
, O
permeability S-PRO
is O
characterised O
by O
using O
gradient O
pressure S-CONPRI
to O
push O
liquid O
through O
porous B-MATE
material E-MATE
. O


Zhang O
stated O
that O
permeability S-PRO
may O
influence O
vascular B-CONPRI
invasion E-CONPRI
and O
the O
supply O
of O
nutrients O
required O
to O
sustain O
cell B-CHAR
growth E-CHAR
and O
may O
also O
provide O
an O
outlet O
for O
the O
removal O
of O
cell B-BIOP
debris E-BIOP
, O
thereby O
increasing O
its O
osteoconductive B-PRO
potential E-PRO
. O


High O
permeability S-PRO
of O
titanium B-APPL
implants E-APPL
enhances O
the O
osseointegration S-PRO
process O
. O


Further O
research S-CONPRI
on O
the O
effect O
of O
permeability S-PRO
of O
porous B-APPL
metallic I-APPL
implants E-APPL
is O
in O
demand O
. O


In O
summary O
, O
porosity S-PRO
, O
pore B-PARA
size E-PARA
and O
pore S-PRO
interconnectivity O
are O
key O
factors O
that O
will O
significantly O
influence O
the O
mechanical B-CONPRI
properties E-CONPRI
and O
biological B-CONPRI
performance I-CONPRI
of I-CONPRI
scaffolds E-CONPRI
such O
as S-MATE
bone O
ingrowth O
and O
transportation O
of O
cells S-APPL
and O
nutrients O
. O


For O
example O
, O
increasing O
the O
porosity S-PRO
may O
enhance O
the O
biological B-CONPRI
processes E-CONPRI
, O
but O
it O
can O
decrease O
the O
stiffness S-PRO
and O
strength S-PRO
drastically O
. O


Therefore O
, O
finding O
the O
optimal O
topologies S-CONPRI
for O
scaffolds S-FEAT
is O
of O
critical O
importance O
. O


However O
, O
conventional O
CAD-based B-ENAT
design E-ENAT
techniques O
are O
inefficient O
and O
usually O
fail O
to O
obtain O
the O
optimal O
scaffold S-FEAT
design S-FEAT
because O
a O
prohibitively O
large O
number O
of O
trials O
would O
be S-MATE

In O

the O

termed O

3.2 O
Constraints O
in O

for O
additive B-MANP

Although O
AM S-MANP
can O
theoretically O
produce O
structures O
in O
any O
shape O
, O
the O
quality S-CONPRI
of O
the O
structures O
may O
vary O
significantly O
depending O
on O
the O
design S-FEAT
and O
fabrication S-MANP
parameters O
. O


Therefore O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
consider O
the O
processability O
of O
the O
designed S-FEAT
parts O
during O
the O
topological B-FEAT

process S-CONPRI
, O
including O

of O

However O
, O
there O
is O
still O
limited O
research S-CONPRI
on O
creating O
design S-FEAT
guidelines O
to O
achieve O
this O
goal O
. O


Kranz O
experimentally O
investigated O
the O

of O
Laser B-MANP
Additive I-MANP

of O
Ti6Al4V S-MATE
and O
presented O
a O
comprehensive O

catalogue O
. O


In O
their O
research S-CONPRI
, O
restrictions O
and O
recommendations O
were O
presented O
based O
on O
experimental S-CONPRI
measurements O
of O
different O
characteristics O
such O
as S-MATE

, O

, O

, O
hollow O

, O

and O

. O


They O
also O
found O
that O
the O
quality S-CONPRI
of O
AM B-MACEQ
parts E-MACEQ
was O
highly O
dependent O
on O
the O
materials S-CONPRI
, O
machines S-MACEQ
and O
process B-CONPRI
parameters E-CONPRI
. O


Therefore O
, O
similar O
guidelines O
could O
be S-MATE
achieved O
through O
similar O
methodology S-CONPRI
on O
different O
material S-MATE
systems O
. O


Among O
many O
parameters S-CONPRI
, O
frequently O
discussed O
one O
includes O
overhanging B-CONPRI
structures E-CONPRI
, O
which O
may O
lead S-MATE
to O
some O
undesirable O

In O
an O

process E-MANP
, O
the O

is O
not O
supported O
by O
solidified O
section O
or O

when O
it O

Therefore O
, O
the O
overhanging B-CONPRI
structure E-CONPRI
is O
strongly O
influenced O
by O
the O
orientation S-CONPRI
of O
building O

Therefore O
, O
the O
critical B-FEAT

angle E-FEAT
is O
of O
great O
importance O
since O
it O
determines O
the O
form O
of O

hence O

Otherwise O

A O
better O
choice O
in O
design S-FEAT

to O
adopt O

such O
as S-MATE

a O

the O

, O
no O

There O

design S-FEAT

so O
that O

This O

An O
important O
issue O
that O
may O
not O
be S-MATE
neglected O
when O
applying O
topology B-FEAT
optimization E-FEAT
to O
scaffold S-FEAT

is O
to O
consider O
the O
differences O
in O
physical O

mechanical B-CONPRI
properties E-CONPRI
of O
base O
materials S-CONPRI
produced O
by O

The O
material B-CONPRI
property E-CONPRI
in O
AM B-MANP
process E-MANP
may O
greatly O
affect O
the O
final O
topological O

which O
may O
differ O
from O

Moreover O
, O
good O
understanding O
of O
the O

in O

This O
section O
will O
review O
the O
status O
of O

on O
AM S-MANP

of O
three O
main O

4.1 O
Biocompatible B-MATE
Ti I-MATE
alloys I-MATE
Metals E-MATE
in O
biological B-CONPRI
systems E-CONPRI
may O
experience O
corrosion S-CONPRI
and O
release O
ions O
, O
which O
may O
result O
in O
many O
adverse O
physiological O
effects O
. O


Therefore O
, O
the O
biocompatibility S-PRO
of O
any O
implant S-APPL
must O
be S-MATE
quantified O
to O
decrease O
the O
patient O
's O
risk O
and O
the O
failure S-CONPRI
of O
the O

The O
cytotoxicity S-PRO
of O
typical O
surgical O
implant S-APPL
alloys S-MATE
and O
pure B-MATE
metals E-MATE
have O
been O
broadly O
studied O
in O
the O
past O
decades O
. O


It O
is O
now O
commonly O
accepted O
that O
vanadium S-MATE
may O
cause O
sterile B-MACEQ
abscess E-MACEQ
and O
aluminium S-MATE
may O
cause O
scar B-BIOP
tissue E-BIOP
, O
whereas O
titanium S-MATE
, O
zirconium S-MATE
, O
niobium S-MATE
and O
tantalum S-MATE
exhibit O
excellent O
biocompatibility S-PRO
. O


Another O
important O
motivation O
behind O
the O
design S-FEAT
of O
biocompatible B-MATE
Ti I-MATE
alloys E-MATE
is O
the O
opportunity O
to O
decrease O
the O
modulus O
of O
Ti B-MATE
alloys E-MATE
by O
adding O
elements S-MATE
. O


As S-MATE
mentioned O
above O
, O
the O
elements S-MATE
should O
be S-MATE
biocompatible O
. O


Various O
Ti B-MATE
alloys E-MATE
composed O
of O
low O
modulus O
biocompatible B-FEAT
elements E-FEAT
were O
developed O
. O


These O
alloys S-MATE
exhibited O
lower O
modulus O
than O
the O
commonly O
used O
Ti6Al4V S-MATE
. O


One O
example O
is O
Ti13Nb13Zr S-MATE
, O
which O
showed O
improved O
bone S-BIOP
biocompatibility S-PRO
and O
a O
modulus O
of O
79 O
GPa S-PRO

Other O
Ti B-MATE
alloys E-MATE
which O
exhibited O
lower O
modulus O
included O
Ti29Nb13Ta4.6Zr O
and O
Ti35Nb5Ta7Zr S-MATE
. O


In O
recent O
years O

were O
widely O
reported O
with O

Ryan O

process O
to O
produce O
porous B-FEAT
Ti I-FEAT

scaffolds E-FEAT
using O
wax S-MATE

generated O
by O
CAD S-ENAT

The O
pore B-PARA
size E-PARA
of O
their O
designs S-FEAT
ranged O
from O
200 O
to O
400 O
and O
the O
porosity S-PRO
reached O
66.8 O
% O

This O
method O
could O
achieve O
controlled O
porous S-PRO

and O
ensure O
high B-PARA

in O
manufacturing S-MANP

The O

were O
similar O
to O

manufactured S-CONPRI
by O
conventional O
methods O
. O


This O
method O
could O
also O
be S-MATE
extended O
to O
the O
fabrication S-MANP
of O
other O
metallic B-MACEQ
structures E-MACEQ
which O
are O
difficult O
to O
be S-MATE

made O
by O

the O
mechanical B-CONPRI

that O
when O
the O

, O
the O
elastic B-PRO

decreased O
from O
3.03 O
to O
0.58 O
GPa S-PRO

which O
proved O
that O
the O
elastic B-PRO

of O
porous B-MATE

could O
be S-MATE
readily O
adjusted O

The O

that O

In O

Porous S-PRO

Although O

from O

4.1 O
Deformation S-CONPRI

residual B-PRO
stress E-PRO
Like O
other O
additive B-MANP
manufacturing I-MANP
process E-MANP
, O
distortion S-CONPRI
and O
residual B-PRO
stress E-PRO
are O
inherent O
to O
the O
WAAM S-MANP
process S-CONPRI
and O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
completely O

The O

Therefore O
, O

of O

is O
a O
key O

, O
bending S-MANP

, O

distortion S-CONPRI
and O

The O
distortions O
are O
caused O
by O
thermal B-CONPRI

and O
shrinkage S-CONPRI
of O
the O
part O
during O
repeated O

processes O
, O
which O
is O
particularly O
an O
issue O
for O
large O
thin B-CONPRI

Residual B-PRO
stress E-PRO
is O
the O
stress S-PRO
that O
remains O
in O
the O
material S-MATE
when O
all O
external O
loading O
forces S-CONPRI
are O
removed O
. O


If O
the O
residual B-PRO
stress E-PRO
is O
sufficiently O
high O
, O
it O
can O
be S-MATE
a O
critical O
influential O
factor O
in O
the O
mechanical B-CONPRI
properties E-CONPRI

of O

If O
the O
residual B-PRO

exceeds O
the O
local O
UTS S-PRO
of O
the O

the O
local O

Ding O
found O
that O
the O
residual B-PRO
stress E-PRO

the O
WAAM S-MANP

the O
residual B-PRO

the O

the O
future O

After O

, O
the O

redistributed O
with O
a O
much O
lower O
value O

the O
top O
of O
integral O

the O

Among O
all O
WAAM S-MANP

materials E-MATE
, O
bimetal B-MACEQ
components E-MACEQ
exhibit O
high O
levels O
of O
residual B-PRO
stress E-PRO

deformation S-CONPRI
due O

when O

used O
. O


WAAM-fabricated O
Inconel B-MATE
alloy E-MATE
has O
comparatively O
lower O
residual B-PRO
stresses E-PRO
levels O
, O
but O
it O
is O
more O
susceptible O
to O
process B-CONPRI
defects E-CONPRI
such O
as S-MATE
delamination O
, O
buckling S-PRO
and O
warping S-CONPRI
, O
since O
its O
residual B-PRO
stress E-PRO
is O
usually O
higher O
than O
the O
yield B-PRO
stress E-PRO
. O


Other O
comparatively O
softer O
materials S-CONPRI
, O
such O
as S-MATE
aluminum B-MATE
alloys E-MATE
, O
easily O
respond O
to O
deformation B-PRO
defects E-PRO
due O
to O
their O
high O
thermal B-PRO

. O


A O
better O
understanding O

the O
effect O
of O
material S-MATE
characteristics O
in O
WAAM S-MANP
processing O
is O
needed O
for O
controlling O
residual B-PRO
stress E-PRO
and O
deformation S-CONPRI
during O
deposition S-CONPRI
. O


Deformation S-CONPRI
and O
residual B-PRO
stress E-PRO
are O
associated O
with O
many O
process B-CONPRI
parameters E-CONPRI

such O

Fortunately O

4.2 O
Porosity S-PRO
Porosity O
is O
another O
common O
defect S-CONPRI
in O
WAAM S-MANP
processing O
that O
needs O
to O
be S-MATE
minimized O
due O
to O
adverse O
effects O
on O
mechanical B-CONPRI
properties E-CONPRI
. O


Firstly O
, O
porosity S-PRO
will O
lead S-MATE
to O
a O
component S-MACEQ
with O
low O
mechanical B-PRO
strength E-PRO
by O
damage S-PRO
from O
micro-cracks S-CONPRI
, O
and O
secondly O
, O
it O
usually O
brings O
low O
fatigue S-PRO
property O
to O
deposition S-CONPRI
via O
spatially O
with O
different O
size O
and O
shape O
distribution S-CONPRI
. O


In O
general O
, O
this O
type O
of O
defects S-CONPRI
are O
mainly O
classified O
as S-MATE
either O
raw O
material-induced O
or O
process-induced O
. O


The O
WAAM S-MANP
raw B-MATE
material E-MATE
, O
including O
as-received O
wire O
and O
substrate S-MATE
, O
often O
has O
a O
degree O
of O
surface B-CHAR
contamination E-CHAR
, O
such O
as S-MATE
moisture O
, O
grease O
and O
other O
hydrocarbon O
compounds O
that O
may O
be S-MATE
difficult O
to O
completely O
remove O
. O


These O
contaminants O
can O
be S-MATE
easily O
absorbed O
into O
the O
molten B-CONPRI
pool E-CONPRI
and O
subsequently O
generate O
porosity S-PRO
after O
solidification S-CONPRI
. O


Among O
common O
engineering B-MATE
materials E-MATE
, O
aluminum B-MATE
alloy E-MATE
is O
the O
most O
susceptible O
to O
this O
defect S-CONPRI
as S-MATE
the O
solubility S-PRO
of O
hydrogen O
in O
solid O
and O
liquid O
is O
significantly O
different O
. O


Even O
small O
amounts O
of O
dissolved O
hydrogen O
in O
the O
liquid B-CONPRI
state E-CONPRI
may O
exceed O
the O
limit S-CONPRI
of O
solubility S-PRO
after O
solidification S-CONPRI
, O
resulting O
in O
porosity S-PRO
. O


Therefore O
, O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
raw B-MATE
materials E-MATE
is O
critical O
, O
especially O
for O
aluminum B-MATE
alloys E-MATE
. O


Process-induced O
porosity S-PRO
is O
usually O
non-spherical S-CONPRI
, O
and O
mainly O
caused O
by O
poor O
path B-ENAT
planning E-ENAT
or O
an O
unstable O
deposition B-MANP
process E-MANP
. O


When O
the O
deposition B-PARA
path E-PARA
is O
complex O
or O
the O
manufacturing B-MANP
process E-MANP
is O
changeable O
, O
insufficient B-MATE

To O

the O

methods O
can O
be S-MATE
adopted O
: O
an O
AC O
GMAW-based O
process S-CONPRI

CMT-PADV O

process S-CONPRI
is O

4.3 O
Crack O
and O
delamination S-CONPRI
Similar O
to O
residual B-PRO
stress E-PRO
and O
deformation S-CONPRI
, O
cracking S-CONPRI
and O
delamination S-CONPRI
not O
only O
involves O
the O
thermal O
signature O
of O
the O
manufacturing B-MANP
process E-MANP
, O
but O
also O
relates O
to O
the O
material S-MATE
characteristics O
of O
the O
deposit O
. O


Ordinarily O
, O
the O
crack O
is O
categorised O
as S-MATE
either O
a O
solidification B-CHAR
crack E-CHAR
or O
grain B-PRO
boundary I-PRO
crack E-PRO
within O
the O
WAAM S-MANP
component S-MACEQ
. O


The O
former O
type O
of O
crack O
depends O
mainly O
on O
the O
solidification S-CONPRI
nature O
of O
the O
material S-MATE
and O
is O
usually O
caused O
by O
the O
obstruction O
of O
solidified O
grain S-CONPRI
flow O
or O
high O
strain S-PRO
in O
the O
melt B-MATE
pool E-MATE
. O


Grain B-CONPRI
boundary E-CONPRI
cracking S-CONPRI
often O
generates O
along O
the O
grain B-CONPRI
boundaries E-CONPRI
due O
to O
the O
differences O
between O
boundary B-CHAR
morphology E-CHAR
and O
potential O
precipitate S-MATE
formation O
or O
dissolution O
. O


Generally O
, O
this O
deficiency O
is O
visible O
and O
can O
not O
be S-MATE
repaired O
by O
post-process S-CONPRI
treatment O
. O


In O
order O
to O
prevent O
this O
defect S-CONPRI
, O
pre-process O
treatment O
such O
as S-MATE
preheating O
of O
the O
substrate S-MATE
needs O
to O
be S-MATE
considered O
. O


Bimetal B-MATE
material I-MATE
combinations E-MATE
, O
such O
as S-MATE
Al/Cu S-MATE
, O
Al/Ti S-MATE
and O
Al/Fe S-MATE
, O
are O
quite O
susceptible O
to O
cracking S-CONPRI
and O
delamination S-CONPRI
when O
fabricated S-CONPRI
with O
the O
WAAM S-MANP
process S-CONPRI
. O


The O
dissimilar O
metals S-MATE
have O
large O
differences O
in O
their O
mutual B-PRO
solubility E-PRO
and O
chemical O
reactivity O
so O
that O
the O
intermetallic S-MATE
phase-equilibrium O
is O
freely O
broken O
, O
thus O
inducing O
crack B-CONPRI
growth E-CONPRI
along O
grain B-CONPRI
boundaries E-CONPRI
. O


Also O
, O
Inconel B-MATE
alloy E-MATE
readily O
generates O
solidification B-CONPRI
cracking E-CONPRI
issues O
due O
to O
the O
existence O
of O
liquid O
film O
at O
terminal O
solidification S-CONPRI
. O


Both O
of O
these O
material S-MATE
types O
should O
receive O
particular O
attention O
to O
avoid O
cracking S-CONPRI
and O
delamination S-CONPRI
. O

The O
beauty O

this O

its O
way O
into O
functional O

through O
the O

Learning O
from O
these O
biological B-FEAT

may O
advance O
our O

even O
help O
to O

to O
engineering S-APPL

, O
in O
a O
sustainable S-CONPRI
way O
. O


Biomimicry S-CONPRI
in O
engineering S-APPL
involves O
the O
study O
of O
biological B-CONPRI
systems E-CONPRI
specifically O
with O
the O
aim O
to O
use O
information O
learned O
in O
solving O
engineering S-APPL

. O


Modern O
engineering S-APPL
design S-FEAT
has O
the O
possibility O
to O
change O
the O
structural O
features O
and O
properties S-CONPRI
of O
the O
objects O
while O
maintaining O
functionality O
or O
to O
apply O
simulation S-ENAT
to O
find O
a O
design S-FEAT
for O
specific O
required O
properties S-CONPRI
. O


In O
an O
ideal O
case O
, O
AM S-MANP
is O
able O
to O
translate O
innovative O
biomimetic B-FEAT
design E-FEAT
into O
physical O
objects O
with O
the O
desired O
properties S-CONPRI
and O
functionality O
. O


Much O
of O
this O
potential O
has O
particularly O
realistic O
prospects O
when O
using O
AM S-MANP
, O
with O
its O
freedom O
of O
design S-FEAT
and O
complex O
production S-MANP
capabilities O
. O


The O
capability O
to O
emulate O
the O
complex B-CONPRI
structures E-CONPRI
and O
hence O
the O
properties S-CONPRI
of O
biological B-MATE
materials E-MATE
is O
the O
aim O
of O
biomimicry S-CONPRI
. O


For O
example O
, O
failure S-CONPRI
of O
a O
specific O
design S-FEAT
that O
is O
claimed O
to O
be S-MATE
biomimetic O
but O
uses O
no O
input O
from O
nature O
, O
might O
undermine O
the O
credibility O
of O
biomimicry S-CONPRI
. O


Often O
structures O
with O
curves O
and O
rounded B-FEAT
edges E-FEAT
in O
any O
way O
resembling O
something O
in O
nature O
are O
referred O
to O
as S-MATE
or O
This O
is O
not O
incorrect O
but O
it O
must O
be S-MATE
kept O
in O
mind O
that O
no O
biological B-BIOP
input E-BIOP
is O
present O
, O
and O
as S-MATE
such O
is O
not O
truly O
biomimetic S-CONPRI
or O
bio-inspired S-CONPRI
. O


Additionally O
, O
when O
a O
structure S-CONPRI
is O
designed S-FEAT
for O
a O
biological O
application O
it O
may O
be S-MATE
termed O
biomimetic S-CONPRI
or O
bionic O
simply O
due O
to O
its O
intended O
biological O
role O
. O


Topology B-FEAT
optimization E-FEAT
, O
generative B-ENAT

and O
simulation-driven S-ENAT
design S-FEAT
tools O
used O
to O
create O
optimized O
designs S-FEAT
using O
simulation S-ENAT
often O
create O
unconventional O
and O
complex B-PRO
shapes E-PRO
and O
forms O
. O


The O
simulation-driven S-ENAT
design B-CONPRI
process E-CONPRI
is O
in O
reality O
also O
biomimetic S-CONPRI
or O
bio-inspired S-CONPRI
in O
the O
sense O
that O
it O
is O
iterative O
and O
therefore O
mimics O
aspects O
of O
natural O
evolutionary O
strategies O
in O
a O
short O
timeframe O
. O


In O
the O
area S-PARA
of O
cellular O
or O
lattice B-FEAT
structure I-FEAT
design E-FEAT
, O
some O
engineers O
refer O
to O
all O
porous S-PRO
engineered O
structures O
as S-MATE
biomimetic O
simply O
due O
to O
their O
resemblance O
to O
natural O
porous B-MATE
materials E-MATE
, O
or O
their O
similarity O
to O
the O
biological B-CONPRI
equivalent E-CONPRI
. O


However O
, O
cellular O
and O
lattice B-FEAT
designs E-FEAT
have O
unlimited O
design S-FEAT
permutations O
and O
can O
therefore O
be S-MATE
tailored O
to O
the O
application O
. O


Currently O
, O
the O
most O
important O
application O
for O
these O
porous S-PRO
engineered O
structures O
is O
in O
dental B-APPL
and I-APPL
bone I-APPL
implants E-APPL
. O


The O
latter O
is O
a O
biomimetic B-APPL
application E-APPL
in O
the O
sense O
that O
the O
structure S-CONPRI
should O
emulate O
bone S-BIOP
for O
best O
results O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
mechanical B-CONPRI
properties E-CONPRI
and O
permeability S-PRO

Finally O
, O
biomimetic S-CONPRI
lattice O
structures O
may O
also O
specifically O
refer O
to O
stochastic B-FEAT

with O
a O

A O
biomimetic S-CONPRI

In O

Metals S-MATE
are O
highly O

in O
biomimetic B-APPL
structural I-APPL
applications E-APPL
in O
military S-APPL

due O
to O
the O
light-weight S-PRO

hence O
much O

However O
, O
many O

to O
these O
approaches O
, O
three O
major O
ways O
of O
obtaining O
a O
designed S-FEAT
biomimetic S-CONPRI
model O
in O
practice O
exist O
: O
customized/freeform O
design S-FEAT
, O
simulation-driven S-ENAT
design S-FEAT
and O
lattice B-FEAT
design E-FEAT
. O


For O
example O
, O
lattices S-CONPRI
may O
be S-MATE
incorporated O
in O
a O
freeform B-FEAT
design E-FEAT
process O
or O
in O
a O
simulation-design O
process S-CONPRI
. O


All O
these O
approaches O
may O
also O
be S-MATE
used O
with O
or O
without O
direct O
input O
from O
nature O
, O
with O
varying O
levels O
of O
biological B-BIOP
input E-BIOP
or O
bio-inspiration S-CONPRI
possible O
. O


Customized B-FEAT
and I-FEAT
freeform I-FEAT
design E-FEAT
involves O
manipulation O
with O
curved B-CONPRI
surfaces E-CONPRI
and O
is O
typically O
used O
to O
create O
custom O
and O
unique O
designs S-FEAT
fit O
for O
a O
particular O
application O
while O
maintaining O
functionality O
. O


For O
instance O
, O
customized O
implants S-APPL
aimed O
at O
directly O
replicating O

, O
nervous-system-inspired O

or O
hierarchical B-CONPRI
networks E-CONPRI
where O

constantly O
branch O
and O

This O
process S-CONPRI
is O
the O
simplest O
of O
the O
biomimetic B-FEAT
design E-FEAT
methods O
, O
particularly O
useful O
for O
customization O
such O
as S-MATE
in O
prosthetics S-APPL
or O
implants S-APPL
, O
and O
is O
also O
used O
in O
artistic O
design S-FEAT
. O


With O
reference O
to O
prosthetics S-APPL
and O
implants S-APPL
, O
the O
design S-FEAT
requirement O
is O
taken O
from O
a O
biological B-FEAT
shape E-FEAT
, O
hence O
the O
biomimetic S-CONPRI
description O
. O


In O
addition O
, O
freeform B-FEAT
design E-FEAT
results O
in O
organic O
shapes O
which O
can O
often O
resemble O
natural O
structures O
. O


Simulation-driven S-ENAT
design S-FEAT
is O
a O
very O
promising O
approach O
which O
has O
emerged O
in O
recent O
years O
and O
is O
especially O
useful O
for O
light-weight S-PRO
design S-FEAT
for O
engineering S-APPL
applications O
. O


This O
involves O
structural B-CONPRI
optimization E-CONPRI
and O
uses O
an O
iterative O
process S-CONPRI
of O
simulation S-ENAT
and O
material S-MATE
removal O
to O
optimize O
the O
required O
material S-MATE
distribution S-CONPRI
or O
material B-FEAT
stiffness E-FEAT
for O
a O
given O
set S-APPL
of O
expected O
load O
cases O
. O


This O
process S-CONPRI
of O
stepwise O
optimization S-CONPRI
is O
similar O
to O
most O
evolutionary O
processes S-CONPRI
in O
nature O
, O
and O
removal O
of O

is O
a O
similar O

strategy O
as S-MATE
is O

the O
motivation O
to O
categorize O
this O
process S-CONPRI
as S-MATE

This O

are O
important O
for O

For O
example O
, O
it O

that O

due O
to O

which O
formed O
on O
the O

Takaichi O

that O

smaller O
than O
that O
of O
the O

Thus O
, O
it O
could O
be S-MATE
said O
that O
LPBF B-MATE

have O
superior O

However O
, O

can O
influence O
the O

produced O

It O
is O
already O

that O
the O

of O
microporosity S-PRO

Micro-segregation S-CONPRI

can O
occur O
causing O
different O
corrosion B-PRO

at O

Since O

may O

compared O
to O
the O
center O

It O
was O
found O
that O

depend O
not O
only O
on O
the O

also O
on O
the O

for O

Bobbert O

Despite O
all O
the O
potential O

AM S-MANP
in O
its O
various O
forms O
, O
there O
are O
some O
challenges O
to O
its O
practical O
implementation O
. O


Most O
importantly O
, O
all O
forms O
of O
biomimetic B-FEAT
design E-FEAT
for O
AM S-MANP
involves O
complexity S-CONPRI
in O
various O
forms O
not O
previously O
encountered O
. O


While O
AM S-MANP
relaxes O
the O
traditional B-MANP
manufacturing E-MANP
rules O
, O
not O
any O
geometry S-CONPRI
or O
structure S-CONPRI
can O
be S-MATE
produced O
easily O
or O
reliably O
. O


Due O
to O
the O
complexity S-CONPRI
of O
design S-FEAT
, O
design S-FEAT
for O
AM S-MANP
becomes O
even O
more O
crucial O
to O
ensure O
manufacturability S-CONPRI
and O
might O
involve O
re-design O
in O
cases O
of O
difficult O
geometries S-CONPRI
. O


Metal B-MANP
AM E-MANP
and O
its O
limits S-CONPRI
in O
general O
are O
discussed O
in O
more O
detail O
in O
. O


AM S-MANP
is O
still O
a O
relatively O
new O
manufacturing B-MANP
process E-MANP
which O
requires O
process B-CONPRI
optimization E-CONPRI
and O
quality B-CONPRI
control E-CONPRI
to O
ensure O
accuracy S-CHAR
and O
reliability S-CHAR
. O


This O
requirement O
is O
critically O
important O
for O
parts O
with O
complex B-CONPRI
geometries E-CONPRI
which O
include O
curved B-CONPRI
surfaces E-CONPRI
, O
thin O
connecting O
features O
, O
hidden O
features O
and O
lattice B-FEAT
structures E-FEAT
. O


There O
are O
also O
many O
varieties O
of O
AM S-MANP
with O
different O
trade O
names O
, O
processes S-CONPRI
and O
differences O
in O
quality S-CONPRI
obtained O
. O


This O
quality S-CONPRI
refers O
in O
particular O
to O
material S-MATE

and O
associated O
warping S-CONPRI
and O
cracking S-CONPRI
and O
microstructural S-CONPRI
inhomogeneity O
. O


A O
major O
limitation O
is O
the O
minimum B-PARA
feature I-PARA
size E-PARA
for O
the O
AM S-MANP
system O
used O
. O


Some O
additional O
limitations O
are O
placed O
on O
the O
part O

, O
most O
notably O
the O

. O


All O
down-facing O
surfaces S-CONPRI
have O
typically O
rougher O
surfaces S-CONPRI
than O
upwards-facing O
surfaces S-CONPRI
, O
thin O
angled O
features O
suffer O
from O
stair-step O
effects O
, O
and O
small O
angles O
require O
supports S-APPL
. O


Support S-APPL
removal O
is O
not O
a O
simple S-MANP
process S-CONPRI
: O
this O
post-processing S-CONPRI
is O
time O
consuming O
and O
may O
also O
affect O
the O
dimensional B-CHAR
accuracy E-CHAR
and O
quality S-CONPRI
of O
the O
resulting O
part O
. O


When O
supports S-APPL
are O
needed O
inside O
a O
complex O
part O
, O
these O
supports S-APPL
might O
not O
be S-MATE
physically O
removable O
at O
all O
as S-MATE
shown O
in O
the O
example O
in O
18 O
. O


In O
this O
figure O
, O
two O
topology-optimized O
bracket S-MACEQ

were O
almost O
entirely O

but O
the O
build S-PARA
process O
required O

of O
supports S-APPL
also O
inside O
the O
lattice S-CONPRI
region O
. O


Removing O
supports S-APPL
from O
lattice S-CONPRI
regions O
on O
the O
exterior O
can O
cause O
damage S-PRO
to O
the O
lattice S-CONPRI
struts O
, O
and O
removing O
them O
from O
inside O
the O
lattice S-CONPRI
region O
is O
entirely O
impossible O
. O


In O
this O
case O
, O
the O

but O
the O

as S-MATE
could O
have O
been O
achieved O
by O
appropriate O
design S-FEAT
to O
eliminate O

Due O
to O
the O
expense O
involved O
in O
AM S-MANP
, O
non-destructive O
tools S-MACEQ
are O
especially O
useful O
to O

the O
most O

are O
X-ray S-CHAR
techniques O
such O
as S-MATE
2D S-CONPRI

radiography S-ENAT

Due O
to O
the O
complexity S-CONPRI
of O
the O
parts O
2D S-CONPRI

are O
difficult O
to O
interpret O

As S-MATE

often O
the O

This O

The O
most O

that O

be S-MATE
identified O
by O
microCT S-CHAR
and O
which O
are O
relevant O
to O
biomimetic B-APPL

are O
: O
- O
Powder S-MATE
can O
get O
stuck O
in O
complex O
areas S-PARA
, O
especially O
inside O
lattices S-CONPRI
, O
and O
when O
heat-treated S-MANP
they O
become O
stuck O
. O


This O
adds O
weight S-PARA
and O
might O
be S-MATE
unsafe O
. O


- O
Rough O

with O

measured O
quantitatively S-CONPRI
or O
assessed O
visually O

Manufacturing S-MANP

also O
occur O
despite O

and O
this O
may O
affect O
the O
mechanical B-CONPRI
properties E-CONPRI
. O


It O
is O
important O
to O
note O
here O
that O
process B-CONPRI
parameter E-CONPRI
optimization S-CONPRI
prior O
to O
building O
a O
part O
can O
limit S-CONPRI
process-induced O

expected O
to O
be S-MATE
the O

in O

in O
a O

- O
Residual B-PRO

can O
not O
directly O

The O
first O
worth O
mentioning O
is O
that O
most O
topology B-FEAT
optimization E-FEAT
software S-CONPRI
at O
present O
operates O
on O
the O
topology S-CONPRI
itself O
and O
subsequently O
certain O
areas S-PARA
can O
be S-MATE
selected O
for O
latticing O
, O
i.e O
. O


the O
latticing O
is O
not O
part O
of O
the O
simulation-driven S-ENAT
design B-CONPRI
process E-CONPRI
. O


This O
latticing O
is O
incorporated O
into O
the O
simulation-driven S-ENAT
design B-CONPRI
process E-CONPRI
and O
will O
find O
application O
especially O
in O
light-weighting O
applications O
. O


The O
other O
useful O
development O
is O
the O
optimization S-CONPRI
of O
repeated O
lattices S-CONPRI
gradient O
lattices S-CONPRI
and O
variations S-CONPRI
of O
strut B-PARA
thickness E-PARA
or O
unit B-CONPRI

size O
across O
a O
part O
, O
and O
conformal B-FEAT
lattices E-FEAT
to O
the O
surfaces S-CONPRI
of O
a O
part O
. O


In O
other O
words O
, O
the O
lattice S-CONPRI
is O
not O
simply O
cut O
off O

the O

of O
the O
part O
but O

An O
example O
hereof O
is O
shown O
in O
21 O
where O
the O
lattice S-CONPRI
is O
conformal O
to O
two O
opposing O
surfaces S-CONPRI
and O
the O
lattice B-FEAT
density E-FEAT
varies O
to O

in O
areas S-PARA
where O
simulations S-ENAT

. O


Recent O
research S-CONPRI
approaches O
for O

the O
development O
of O
multi-scale O

approaches O
as S-MATE
described O
by O
Osanov O
and O
Guest O
and O
Cadman O
. O


In O
this O
approach O
, O
the O
unit B-CONPRI
cell E-CONPRI
domain S-CONPRI
is O
discretized O
into O
elements S-MATE
which O
are O
then O
themselves O
optimized O
using O
topology B-FEAT

methods O
, O
similar O
to O
discussions O
in O
the O
previous O
section O
. O


A O
unit B-CONPRI
cell E-CONPRI
so O
designed S-FEAT
can O
then O
be S-MATE
used O
to O
compute O
effective O
properties S-CONPRI
, O
after O
which O
inverse O
homogenization S-MANP
is O
used O
to O
upscale O
the O
cellular O
geometry S-CONPRI
to O
the O
level O
of O
the O
larger O
structure S-CONPRI
. O


These O
ideas O
have O
been O
recently O
extended O
to O
multi-material S-CONPRI
cellular B-FEAT

. O


Cellular O
automata O
methods O
have O
also O
been O
developed O
to O

and O
machine S-MACEQ

methods O
are O
beginning O
to O
be S-MATE
applied O
to O
materials S-CONPRI

. O


Because O
of O
the O
very O
complex B-PRO
shapes E-PRO
of O
the O
parts O
having O
a O
biomimetic S-CONPRI
or O

it O
is O

are O
limited O
in O
this O
process S-CONPRI
, O
since O
with O
constant O
preheating S-MANP
of O
each O

to O
a O
high O
temperature S-PARA
, O
the O
powder S-MATE
is O
partially O
sintered S-MANP
and O
later O
can O
not O
be S-MATE
removed O
from O
the O
manufactured S-CONPRI
part O
. O


There O
are O
also O
quite O
serious O
limitations O
on O
materials S-CONPRI
for O
EBM S-MANP
technology O
. O


Also O
recently O
, O
companies S-APPL
such O
as S-MATE
EOS O
and O
Velo3D O
have O
improved O
their O
softwares O
, O
scanning B-CONPRI
strategies E-CONPRI
and O
process B-CONPRI
control E-CONPRI
parameters S-CONPRI
, O
which O
allowed O
to O
realize O
designs S-FEAT
with O
overhangs S-PARA
lower O
than O

large O

supports S-APPL
. O


These O
developments O
are O
all O
very O
promising O
for O
the O
realization O
of O
increasingly O
complex O
biomimetic B-FEAT
designs E-FEAT
with O
improved O
structural B-PRO
integrity E-PRO
and O
surface B-PARA
quality E-PARA
. O


An O
emerging O
trend S-CONPRI
is O
the O
development O
of O
software S-CONPRI
packages O
incorporating O
the O
entire O
workflow S-CONPRI
for O
advanced O
design S-FEAT
for O
AM S-MANP
, O
including O
freeform B-FEAT
design E-FEAT
, O
topology B-FEAT
optimization E-FEAT
, O
latticing O
and O
more O
recently O
also O
build S-PARA
simulation O
and O
even O
support B-FEAT
generation E-FEAT
and O

. O


When O
all O
this O
is O
combined O
in O
one O
workspace O
the O
entire O
design B-CONPRI
process E-CONPRI
is O
simplified O
and O
this O
allows O
more O
frequent O
and O
improved O
biomimetic B-FEAT
designs E-FEAT
to O
be S-MATE
realized O
in O
practice O
. O


The O
development O
of O
standards S-CONPRI
for O
AM S-MANP
and O
non-destructive B-CHAR
testing E-CHAR
in O
AM S-MANP
is O
emerging O
as S-MATE
an O
important O
aspect O
in O
the O
qualification O
of O
processes S-CONPRI
and O
ensuring O
reliability S-CHAR
in O
AM B-MANP
processes E-MANP
. O


This O
is O
especially O
applicable O
to O
biomimetic B-FEAT
designs E-FEAT
and O
it O
holds O
the O
most O
advantage O
in O
optimizing O
process B-CONPRI
parameters E-CONPRI
prior O
to O
building O
complex O
parts O
- O
using O
microCT S-CHAR
test O
methods O
. O


Inspecting O
complex O
parts O
is O
also O
valuable O
in O
critical O
parts O
such O
as S-MATE
for O
aerospace S-APPL
, O
and O
microCT S-CHAR
is O
the O
best O
method O
to O
do O
this O
. O


It O
is O
worth O
mentioning O
that O
besides O
complex O
part O
inspections S-CHAR
, O
which O
are O
limited O
in O
resolution S-PARA
by O
field O
of O
view O
, O
it O
is O
becoming O
standard S-CONPRI
practice O
to O
inspect O
witness O
specimens O
of O
smaller O
diameter S-CONPRI
built O
alongside O
complex O
parts O
. O


This O
allows O
for O
high B-PARA
resolution E-PARA
CT S-ENAT
analysis O
with O
defects S-CONPRI
found O
in O
these O
specimens O
being O
indicative O
of O
problems O
encountered O
during O
the O
build S-PARA
. O


Something O
that O
is O
becoming O
increasingly O
popular O
for O
improving O
part O
density S-PRO
is O
the O
use O
of O
hot B-MANP
isostatic I-MANP
pressing E-MANP
, O
especially O
for O
additively-manufactured O
metal S-MATE
parts O
for O
aerospace S-APPL
it O
is O
a O
requirement O
that O
all O
parts O
are O
HIPped O
. O


The O
HIP S-MANP
process O
closes O
pores S-PRO
and O
improves O
the O
microstructure S-CONPRI
, O
but O
it O
is O
important O
to O
realize O
that O
not O
all O
pores S-PRO
are O
necessarily O
closed O
by O
HIP S-MANP
: O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
pores S-PRO
connected O
to O
the O
surface S-CONPRI
do O
not O
close O
properly O
, O
and O
is O
detectable O
by O
microCT S-CHAR
. O


The O
important O
point O
is O
that O
HIP S-MANP
should O
not O
be S-MATE
used O
as S-MATE
a O
blind O
solution S-CONPRI
its O
performance S-CONPRI
especially O
in O
thin O
walled O
parts O
should O
be S-MATE
checked O
. O


In O
general O
, O
the O
use O
of O
biomimetic B-APPL
AM E-APPL
is O
growing O
at O
a O
very O
fast O
rate O
, O
with O
practical O
engineering S-APPL
applications O
emerging O
almost O
daily O
. O


This O
is O
driven O
by O
the O
maturation O
of O
metal B-MANP
powder I-MANP
bed I-MANP
fusion E-MANP
AM S-MANP
, O
the O
development O
of O
appropriate O
software S-CONPRI
tools O
, O
and O
the O
huge O
interest O
from O
companies S-APPL
in O
investing O
in O
a O
technology S-CONPRI
with O
clear O
potential O
to O
disrupt O
various O

The O
key O
to O

is O
in O
significant O
advantages O
in O
the O
new O
design S-FEAT
which O
is O
possible O
by O
AM S-MANP
and O
biomimicry S-CONPRI
is O
key O
to O

this O

Besides O

actual O
light-weight S-PRO

the O

In O

the O

Conclusions O
It O
is O
clear O
that O
biomimicry S-CONPRI
in O
AM S-MANP
allows O
complex O
functional O
designs S-FEAT
and O
various O
tools S-MACEQ
are O
currently O
available O
to O
easily O
achieve O
such O
designs S-FEAT
. O


Biomimetic B-FEAT
designs E-FEAT
are O
therefore O
both O
beautiful O
and O
functional O
. O


Despite O
the O
high O
possible O
complexity S-CONPRI
, O
some O
design S-FEAT
for O
AM S-MANP
rules O
have O
emerged O
which O
improve O
the O
manufacturability S-CONPRI
and O
reliability S-CHAR
of O
these O
types O
of O
parts O
and O
these O
should O
be S-MATE
incorporated O
into O
the O
design B-CONPRI
process E-CONPRI
. O


It O
is O
especially O
important O
that O
process B-CONPRI
parameters E-CONPRI
are O
optimized O
to O
ensure O
structural B-PRO
integrity E-PRO
and O
ensure O
high O
quality S-CONPRI
manufacturing S-MANP
, O
as S-MATE
manufacturing O
errors S-CONPRI
might O
affect O
these O
parts O
more O
than O
traditional O
parts O
this O
requires O
an O
additional O
safety B-FEAT
factor E-FEAT
to O
be S-MATE
built O
into O
designs S-FEAT
, O
and O
inspection S-CHAR
is O
critical O
. O


Post-processing S-CONPRI
of O
parts O
is O
also O
a O
challenge O
, O
and O
the O
options O
are O
limited O
therefore O
depending O
on O
the O
application O
the O
complexity S-CONPRI
of O
the O
design S-FEAT
might O
need O
to O
be S-MATE
constrained O
to O
ensure O
all O
surfaces S-CONPRI
are O
accessible O
by O
required O
post-processing S-CONPRI
techniques O
. O


One O
of O
the O
most O
widely O
used O
applications O
of O
biomimetic B-FEAT
design E-FEAT
in O
AM S-MANP
is O
light-weighting O
, O
but O
many O
other O
opportunities O
exist O
including O
parts O
customized O
for O
acoustic O
, O
thermal O
, O
optical S-CHAR
or O
other O
applications O
, O
especially O
in O
combination O
with O
surface B-MANP
modification E-MANP
techniques O
. O


Most O
importantly O
, O
all O
examples O
in O
this O
work O
clearly O
demonstrate O
that O
biomimetic B-FEAT
designs E-FEAT
can O
be S-MATE
trusted O
and O
should O
be S-MATE
used O
more O
widely O
. O


Biomimetic B-FEAT
designs E-FEAT
are O
crucial O
for O
fully O
unlocking O
the O
power S-PARA
of O
metal B-MANP
AM E-MANP
in O
particular O

In O
conclusion O
, O
biomimicry S-CONPRI
in O
AM S-MANP
has O
been O
shown O
to O
be S-MATE
possible O
in O
various O
ways O
, O
with O
the O
most O
accessible O
tools S-MACEQ
currently O
being O
freeform B-FEAT
design E-FEAT
and O
simulation-driven S-ENAT
design S-FEAT
. O


These O
tools S-MACEQ
allow O
complex O
forms O
to O
be S-MATE
created O
which O
often O
resemble O
natural O
structures O
, O
and O
the O
design S-FEAT
engineer O
may O
incorporate O
from O
naturein O
this O
design B-CONPRI
process E-CONPRI
. O


For O
example O
, O
in O
simulation-driven S-ENAT
design S-FEAT
, O
various O
outcomes O
are O
possible O
and O
selection O
of O
the O
design S-FEAT
outcome O
most O
similar O
to O
a O
biological B-FEAT
structure E-FEAT
is O
most O
likely O
the O
best O
solution S-CONPRI
. O


The O
greatest O
future O
potential O
for O
biomimicry S-CONPRI
in O
AM S-MANP
lies O
in O
incorporating O
real O
biological B-BIOP
input E-BIOP
in O
some O
ways O
in O
the O
design B-CONPRI
process E-CONPRI
and O
here O
biological B-MATE
materials E-MATE
science O
is O
crucial O
in O
providing O
from O
naturewhich O
can O
be S-MATE
incorporated O
easily O
. O


It O
is O
not O
only O
in O
the O
design B-CONPRI
process E-CONPRI
where O
biomimicry S-CONPRI
can O
be S-MATE
employed O
. O


The O
entire O
process S-CONPRI
of O
3D B-MANP
printing E-MANP
may O
follow O
biological O
principles O
, O
including O
sustainability S-CONPRI
. O


Biomimetic B-FEAT
design E-FEAT
therefore O
forms O
part O

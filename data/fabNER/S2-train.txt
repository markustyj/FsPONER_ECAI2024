One O

the O

used O
as S-MATE
the O

which O
were O
considered O
too O
short O
to O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
enhance O
the O
mechanical B-PRO
strength E-PRO
of O
composites S-MATE
. O


However O
, O
in O
this O
study O
we O
show O
for O
the O
first O
time O
that O
milled B-MATE
carbon I-MATE
fibers E-MATE
have O
the O
ability O
to O
significantly O
reinforce O
the O
thermoset O

and O
the O
composites S-MATE
reinforced O
with O
these O
fibers S-MATE
achieve O
mechanical S-APPL
performances O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
composites S-MATE
reinforced O
with O
longer O
fibers S-MATE
. O


We O
believe O
that O
a O
transformation O
takes O
place O
at O
high O
fiber S-MATE
volumes O
on O
the O

within O
the O

, O
leading O
to O
higher O
levels O
of O
strength S-PRO
and O
a O

. O


This O
pseudo O
transformation O
can O
give O
rise O
to O
short B-MATE
fibers E-MATE
that O
act O
as S-MATE
if O
they O
are O
longer O
, O
which O
aids O
in O
the O
effective O
transfer O
of O
tensile B-CHAR
loads E-CHAR
from O
the O
matrix O
phase S-CONPRI
to O
the O
fibers S-MATE
. O


This O
study O
also O
showed O
that O
the O
mechanical B-CONPRI
properties E-CONPRI
of O
the O
additively O
fabricated S-CONPRI
thermoset O

match O
those O
of O
ubiquitous O
, O
denser O
structural O
metals S-MATE
, O
and O
these O
properties S-CONPRI
show O
nearly O
isotropic S-PRO

. O


Therefore O
, O
these O
systems O
have O
great O
potential O
to O
find O
immediate O
applications O
where O

To O

we O

Here O

the O
Sierpinski O

The O

The O
Sierpinski O

were O
fabricated S-CONPRI
by O
two O
methods O

the O

involves O

the O

out O
of O
acrylonitrile B-MATE

, O
the O
second O
method O

polylactic B-MATE
acid E-MATE

Of O

In O

restrict O

Therefore O
, O
these O

It O

that O

However O
, O

Therefore O
, O
the O

at O

high O
enough O

Additive B-MANP
manufacturing E-MANP
( O
AM S-MANP
) O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
construct O
complex B-CONPRI
geometries E-CONPRI
through O
the O
simple S-MANP
and O
highly O
repetitive O
process S-CONPRI
of O
layer-by-layer B-CONPRI
deposition E-CONPRI
. O


The O
process S-CONPRI
is O
repetitive O
and O
fully O
automated O
, O
but O
the O
interactions O
between O
layers O
during O
deposition S-CONPRI
are O
tightly O
coupled O

To O
unravel O
these O
interactions O
, O
the O
computational B-ENAT
models E-ENAT
of O
the O
manufacturing B-MANP

are O
critically O
needed O
. O


However O
, O
current O
state-of-the-art S-CONPRI
physics-based B-CONPRI
models E-CONPRI
are O
computationally O
demanding O
and O
can O
not O
be S-MATE
used O
for O
any O
realistic O

. O


To O
address O
this O
challenge O
, O
we O
built O
a O
surrogate O
model S-CONPRI
( O
SM S-MATE
) O
of O
thermal B-CONPRI
profiles E-CONPRI
that O
significantly O
reduced O
the O
computational O

. O


We O
built O
this O
model S-CONPRI
based O
on O
the O
observation O
that O
any O
AM B-MANP
process E-MANP
exhibits O
a O
high O
level O
of O
redundancy O
and O
periodicity O
, O
making O
it O
an O
ideal O
problem O
for O
machine S-MACEQ

and O
surrogate O
modeling.We O
introduced O
a O
unique O
geometry S-CONPRI
representation O
that O
is O
the O
key O
insight O
for O
this O
work O
. O


Rather O
than O
directly O
using O
the O

, O
we O
directly O
use O
the O
GCode O
and O
translate O
it O
into O
a O
set S-APPL
of O
features O
( O
local O
distances O
from O

, O
e.g. O
, O
extruder S-MACEQ

e.g. O
, O

. O


This O
set S-APPL
of O
features O
is O
directly O
used O
as S-MATE
an O
input O
for O
the O
SM S-MATE
of O

Since O
this O
set S-APPL
can O
be S-MATE
calculated O
a O

from O
GCode O
, O
the O
explicit O

considerations O
are O
largely O
factored O
out O

Moreover O
, O
we O
leveraged O
the O

to O
determine O

We O
showed O
that O
for O
fused B-MANP

the O
size O
of O
HIZ O
is O
small O
; O
thus O
, O
the O
number O
of O

for O
the O
SM S-MATE
is O
small O
as S-MATE
well.To O
build S-PARA
the O
SM S-MATE
, O
we O
first O
generated O
the O
thermal O
data S-CONPRI
using O
a O
physics-based B-CONPRI
model E-CONPRI
and O
use O
it O
to O
train O
an O
artificial B-ENAT

We O
trained O
the O
SM S-MATE
and O
demonstrate O
its O
high O
predictive O
power S-PARA
and O
low O
computational O

. O


With O
such O
performance S-CONPRI
, O
this O

opens O

It O

In O

Within O
these O

, O
the O

in O

For O

From O

the O

Thus O

Moreover O

it O

that O

The O

Afterward O

Many O

This O

describes O
a O
facile O
method O
to O
fabricate S-MANP

three-dimensional S-CONPRI
( O

) O
antennas O
by O
vacuum O
filling O
gallium-based O
liquid B-MATE
metals E-MATE
into O
3D B-MANP
printed E-MANP
cavities O
at O
room O
temperature S-PARA
. O


To O
create O
the O
cavities O
, O
a O
commercial O
printer S-MACEQ
co-prints O
a O
sacrificial O
wax-like O
material S-MATE
with O
an O
acrylic S-MATE
resin O
. O


Dissolving O
the O
printed O
wax S-MATE
in O
oil S-MATE
creates O
cavities O
as S-MATE
small O
as S-MATE
500 O
μm O
within O
the O
acrylic S-MATE
monolith O
. O


Placing O
the O
entire O
structure S-CONPRI
under O
vacuum O
evacuates O
most O
of O
the O
air O
from O
these O
cavities O
through O
a O
reservoir O
of O
liquid B-MATE
metal E-MATE
that O
covers O
a O
single O
inlet S-MACEQ
. O


Returning O
the O
assembly S-MANP
to O
atmospheric O
pressure S-CONPRI
pushes O
the O
metal S-MATE
from O
the O
reservoir O
into O
the O
cavities O
due O
to O
the O
pressure S-CONPRI
differential O
. O


This O
method O
enables O
filling O
of O
the O
closed O
internal O
cavities O
to O
create O
planar O
and O
curved O
conductive O
3D B-FEAT
geometries E-FEAT
without O
leaving O
pockets O
of O
trapped O
air O
that O
lead S-MATE
to O

An O
advantage O
of O
this O
technique O
is O
the O
ability O
to O

using O
a O
simple S-MANP
process S-CONPRI
. O


Because O
the O
conductors S-MATE
are O
liquid O
, O
they O
also O
enable O
the O
possibility O
of O
manipulating O
the O
properties S-CONPRI
of O
such O
devices O
by O
flowing O

The O
measured O
electrical B-CONPRI

indicating O
that O
the O

forms O

Nowadays O
, O
understanding O

which O
must O
take O

the O

One O
of O

have O
been O
fabricated S-CONPRI

are O
measured O
in O

Once O
the O

showed O
a O
good O
agreement O
with O
the O

, O
the O
validated O
model S-CONPRI
has O
been O
used O
to O
predict O
the O
residual B-PRO

. O


Different O

been O

Different O

Finally O

The O

it O
was O

that O

Generally O
, O
it O
was O
shown O
that O

However O
, O
the O

Therefore O
it O
can O

that O

In O

This O
phenomenon O
, O
known O

, O
is O
frequently O
found O
in O

Using O

the O

It O
was O

that O

whereas O

Hence O
, O
the O
cracking S-CONPRI

believed O

be S-MATE

follows O
: O
crack O

the O

these O

The O

The O

The O

Photopolymerization-based S-CONPRI
3D B-MANP

emerged O

However O
, O
during O
the O

, O
polymerized B-MATE
materials E-MATE
such O

hydrogels O
often O

highly O
light-scattering S-CONPRI

thus O
perturbing B-CONPRI

To O

, O
we O
developed O
a O

flashing B-MANP

Our O

where O

During O
the O
period O
of O
flash B-CONPRI
exposure E-CONPRI
, O
the O
prepolymer B-MATE
material E-MATE
negligibly O
scatters O
light O
. O


The O
material S-MATE
then O
polymerizes S-CONPRI
and O
opacifies S-CONPRI
in O
absence O

, O
therefore O
the O
exposure B-CONPRI

A high-specific-resistance layer is formed on a soft magnetic layer of an upper core layer in a thin-film magnetic head. The high-specific-resistance layer has a specific resistance which is higher than the specific resistance of the softer magnetic layer. This high-specific-resistance layer can reduce eddy current loss which is generated as the recording frequency increases. The thin-film magnetic head is suitable for high recording frequencies.

 An inductive write head has its write poles and write gap oriented to generate magnetic fields in the cross-track direction on a magnetic recording disk in a disk drive. The disk has the magnetizations in the concentric data tracks oriented in the cross-track direction with the concentric data tracks magnetically separated from each other by guard bands. The write head may have an erase pole and an erase gap to generate magnetic fields in an along-the-track direction on the sides of the data tracks, with the along-the-track magnetizations serving as the guard bands.

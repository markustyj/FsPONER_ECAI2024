 A transmission line circuit provides a structure for improved transmission line operation on integrated circuits. The transmission line circuit includes a first layer of electrically conductive material on a substrate. A first layer of insulating material is formed on the first layer of the electrically conductive material. A number of high permeability metal lines are formed on the first layer of insulating material. The number of high permeability metal lines includes composite hexaferrite films. A number of transmission lines is formed on the first layer of insulating material and between and parallel with the number of high permeability metal lines. A second layer of insulating material is formed on the transmission lines and the high permeability metal lines. The transmission line circuit includes forming a second layer of electrically conductive material on the second layer of insulating material.

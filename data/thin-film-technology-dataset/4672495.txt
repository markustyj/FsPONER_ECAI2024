A thin-film magnetic head includes a substrate composed of a plurality of blocks, a plurality of lower magnetic layers alternating with the blocks, and an upper magnetic layer disposed as a thin film on the blocks across the lower magnetic layers. Each of the lower magnetic layers has a width defining a track width of the magnetic head and a height larger than the width, and the upper magnetic layer has a length extending in the direction of the track width and larger than a yoke length thereof.

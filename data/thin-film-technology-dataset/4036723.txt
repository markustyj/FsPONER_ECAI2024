An insulating film substantially free from surface irregularities is RF bias sputtered onto a smooth polycrystalline or micro-roughened surface. Controlled sputtering is performed first at a low reemission coefficient and then, after a substantially continuous layer of insulative amorphous film is deposited over the substrate, increasing the reemission coefficient to a second higher level. A low reemission coefficient is about 0.25 and a high coefficient is about 0.7.

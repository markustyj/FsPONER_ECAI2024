 A method for providing a perpendicular magnetic recording transducer is described. The method and system include providing a metallic underlayer and providing an insulator, at least a portion of which is on the metallic underlayer. The method and system also include forming a trench in the insulator. The bottom of the trench is narrower than the top of the trench and includes a portion of the metallic underlayer. The method and system also include providing a nonmagnetic seed layer that substantially covers at least the bottom and sides of the trench. The method and system also include plating a perpendicular magnetic pole material on at least a portion of the seed layer and removing a portion of the perpendicular magnetic pole material. A remaining portion of the perpendicular magnetic pole material forms a perpendicular magnetic recording pole.

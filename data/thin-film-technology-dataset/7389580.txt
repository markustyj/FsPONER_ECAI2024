 A method and system for fabricating solid-state energy-storage devices including fabrication films for devices without an anneal step. A film of an energy-storage device is fabricated by depositing a first material layer to a location on a substrate. Energy is supplied directly to the material forming the film. The energy can be in the form of energized ions of a second material. Supplying energy directly to the material and/or the film being deposited assists in controlling the growth and stoichiometry of the film. The method allows for the fabrication of ultrathin films such as electrolyte films and dielectric films.

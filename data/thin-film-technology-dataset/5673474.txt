A method is provided for fabricating a thin film magnetic head on a substrate. A seed layer formed on the substrate and advantageously used as a common seed for a plurality of magnetic head related structures which are built-up on the substrate. A lower magnetic layer is plated on the substrate in an opening provided in an insulative layer which is deposited on the substrate. The aforementioned seed layer is used as the seed for the plating of this lower magnetic layer. A plurality of magnetic layers are plated at one end of the lower magnetic layer to build-up and form a first side pole by again using the aforementioned seed layer as a seed. Another plurality of magnetic layers are plated at the other end of the lower magnetic layer to build-up and form a second side pole by using the same seed layer as a seed. The first and second side poles thus formed include upper and lower ends, the lower ends being plated to the ends of the lower magnetic layer. A first upper pole is plated to the upper end of the first side pole. The first upper pole includes a gap end facing the second side pole. A gap region of nonmagnetic material is deposited adjacent the gap end of the first upper pole. A second upper pole is plated to the upper end of the second side pole and includes a gap end adjacent the gap region.

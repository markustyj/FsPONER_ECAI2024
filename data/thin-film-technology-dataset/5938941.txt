An inductive head structure provided in a magnetoresistance effect composite head includes an inductive head and a magnetoresistance effect head, the inductive head structure including a magnetic gap layer sandwiched by first and second magnetic layers acting as magnetic poles, the first magnetic layer being positioned close to the magnetoresistance effect head, the magnetic gap layer being made of a non-magnetic and electrically insulative material, wherein the non-magnetic and electrically insulative material has a higher etching rate to reactive ion etching than at least a magnetic material of the second magnetic layer.

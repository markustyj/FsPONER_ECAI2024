 A pedestal is formed over a first pole piece layer and insulator materials are formed to surround it. A gap layer made of a non-magnetic insulator or metal is then formed over the pedestal and the insulator, followed by the optional formation of a seed layer. A second pole piece is formed over the gap layer with or without the seed layer by forming a patterned resist using E-beam lithography and electroplating second pole piece materials within the patterned resist. After milling to remove side portions of the gap layer and the optional seed layer, a chemical etch is performed to remove a top portion of the insulator materials. The pedestal is then notched and trimmed by ion milling using the second pole piece as a mask to form a central notched structure. Since the second pole piece is precisely centered over the pedestal prior to notching, the pedestal is notched symmetrically to form a notched structure having side walls with angled slopes.

A magnetic head is mounted on a camera film platen which is supported for constrained movement relative to the camera body to maintain a precise relationship between an information track recorded on the film and a film edge. The magnetic head is pivotally mounted on the film platen. Means are provided to establish one angular orientation of the head to establish one angular orientation of the head with respect to the film during prewind to read information recorded by the film manufacturer and a second different angular orientation during transport of the film in the opposite direction during film exposure to record information relating to film exposure. This enables a camera to distinguish between information recorded by the manufacturer and information recorded by a camera to determine if mid-roll interrupt occurred and, if so, the location of the last frame exposed.

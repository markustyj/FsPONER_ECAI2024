During a lapping operation to obtain an optimum throat height for a thin film magnetic head, an M-H looper circuit is coupled directly to the head coil for measuring the magnetization and saturation current of the head in response to a given drive current. An amplitude modulated analog output signal is digitized and the resultant digital number is compared to stored data signals which are representative of optimum throat heights for the design of the head being lapped. The lapping operation is controlled in response to the difference signals obtained by the comparison.

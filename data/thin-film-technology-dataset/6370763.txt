Disclosed is a magnetic head manufacturing method for accurately measuring resistance value whereby magnetic heads are processed while measuring the resistance values of process monitoring element. After forming on a wafer magnetic head elements and monitoring element, in which resistance values change in analog fashion in line with processing, these elements are cut from the wafer. Next, the magnetic heads are processed to a prescribed height while measuring the resistance values of the monitoring element. In the forming process, the difference .DELTA.I between the positions of the magnetic head elements and monitoring element is measured in advance, and this difference .DELTA.I is used to convert the resistance values of the monitoring element to the height of the magnetic head elements. This makes it possible to correct errors in masks. Furthermore, patterns can be formed accurately by setting the position of the monitoring element to the same position as the magnetoresistive film of the magnetic heads.

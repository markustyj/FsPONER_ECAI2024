 First and second magnetic layers of a magnetic head face each other. A toroidal coil layer having upper and lower layer coil pieces (ULCP and LLCP) is wound around one of the magnetic layers. The ULCP extend from a first insulating layer by downward steps to a top of a second insulating layer which is widened at ends of the first insulating layer. Side ends of the first insulating layer extend parallel to a height direction. The ULCP are orthogonal to the side ends. Each of the LLCP is formed on a third insulating layer and has a straight region extending in the same direction as the upper layer coil pieces and a curved region curved toward a facing surface or in a height direction on one end in the track width direction. An end of each of the straight and curved region is connected to an ULCP.

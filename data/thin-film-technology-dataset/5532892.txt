A soft adjacent layer biased magnetoresistive ("MR") device, and a method for producing the same, which incorporates a natural flux closure design utilizing coplanar thin film permanent magnets to stabilize the device while obviating induced domain walls in the magnetoresistive and soft adjacent layers ("SAL"). The device structure includes an SAL film and overlying magnetic spacer layer ("MSL") in conjunction with an MR film to produce an SAL biased magnetoresistive structure ("MRS") with the MR layer patterned to a shortened length with respect to the SAL and MSL layers. A non-magnetic metal or dielectric separation layer of on the order of 20-300 angstroms (".ANG.") is then deposited over the MSL layer and the sides of the MR layer followed by the deposition of permanent magnet layer portions substantially coplanar with the MR layer to produce a low energy equilibria device with high sensitivity and superior signal output.

A soft magnetic thin film according to the invention has an atomic ratio composition represented by the formula:wherein M is at least one element selected from Group 3A elements and Group 4A elements, 2.ltoreq.a.ltoreq.15 and 4.ltoreq.b.ltoreq.35. It has a high saturation magnetic flux density Bs, high magnetic permeability .mu., low coercive force Hc, improved frequency response, high electric resistivity .rho., and good corrosion resistance.

A magnetoresistive thin film head comprises a magnetoresistive element including an antiferromagnetic layer, a pinning layer, a nonmagnetic conductive layer and a free magnetic layer, and a pair of the right and the left laminated transverse biasing layers, each including a nonmagnetic layer, a ferromagnetic layer and an antiferromagnetic layer, provided on the free magnetic layer constituting said magnetoresistive element. The layer thickness of said nonmagnetic layer has been established to a certain specific value so that magnetizing direction in said free magnetic layer opposing to the ferromagnetic layer via said nonmagnetic layer assumes a direction that is opposite to that of said ferromagnetic layer.

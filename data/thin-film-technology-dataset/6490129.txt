An inductive thin-film magnetic head with small fluctuations of the reproduction output and noises for reproduction is disclosed. The forward end of each of a lower magnetic core and an upper magnetic core has the same width as the track. The rear end of each of the lower magnetic core and the upper magnetic core, on the other hand, is wider than the forward end thereof in the direction transverse of the track. Also, the lower magnetic core is formed of at least two magnetic layers with a non-magnetic layer interposed therebetween.

 An optical path or waveguide for a laser-assisted transducing head is disclosed. The optical path extends between the poles of the transducing head to near the write gap. A solid-state laser is attached to or incorporated into the slider or head and is positioned to direct thermal energy through a waveguide and onto a track of a read/write surface to lower the coercivity of the recording medium to facilitate the write process.

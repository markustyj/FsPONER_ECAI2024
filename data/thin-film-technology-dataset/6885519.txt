Provided are a thin film magnetic head having superior overwrite characteristics as well as having a locally minimized pole width and a method of manufacturing the same. A top pole chip comprises a first magnetic film that is a top layer portion of the top pole chip, and a second magnetic film that is a bottom layer portion of the top pole chip. Both the first and second magnetic films are made of a magnetic material having a high magnetic flux density of 1.5 tesla or more. Even when the pole width is locally minimized to about 0.3 .mu.m or less, the saturation of magnetic flux in the top pole chip can be prevented, and therefore superior overwrite characteristics can be ensured.

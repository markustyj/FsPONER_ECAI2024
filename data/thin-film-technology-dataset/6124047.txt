A soft magnetic film comprises a Co--M--T--C alloy wherein a film structure is predominantly made of an amorphous phase and element M and C are chemically combined. The use of this film as a lower core layer in an MR/inductive composite-type thin film magnetic head ensures high saturation magnetic flux density, high resistivity, low magnetostriction constant and appropriate magnetic field, and leads to improvements in core and shield functions of the lower core layer.

A thin film magnetic head comprises a first magnetic yoke layer extending from a back gap region to a sensing edge such as an air bearing surface (ABS), and a second magnetic yoke layer contacting the first magnetic yoke layer at the back gap region and extending to the ABS in a position aligned with, but spaced from, the first magnetic yoke layer. A pole tip structure, with geometry formed by a single photolithographic process, comprising a first pole tip layer, a gap forming layer, and a second pole tip layer is positioned between the first and second magnetic yoke layers at the ABS with the first pole tip layer in contact with the first magnetic yoke layer and the second pole tip layer in contact with the second magnetic yoke layer at the ABS.

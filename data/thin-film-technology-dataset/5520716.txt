An Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 -TiC sintered product comprising Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 as a main component and containing TiC in an amount of from 20 to 40% by weight, wherein the average particle diameter of Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 particles in the sintered product is larger by 5 to 50% than the average particle diameter of TiC particles, the average particle diameter of the sintered product as a whole is not larger than 1 .mu.m, the average particle diameter of TiC particles is not larger than 0.9 .mu.m, and the total amount of the grain boundary phases other than Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 and TiC is not larger than 1.0% by weight. The Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 -TiC sintered product can be used as a substrate 1 for a magnetic head, and has portions such as grooves 4 and stepped portions formed in the surface of the air bearing surface 2 of the slider by being irradiated with ions. The sintered product exhibits excellent surface quality after machined by being irradiated with ions and can be machined at an increased rate. Hence, the air bearing surface of the slider such as of a thin-film head can be finely machined maintaining excellent precision making it possible to enhance reliability of the magnetic head.

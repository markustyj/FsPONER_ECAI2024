 A magnetic element has a first magnetic material exhibiting thermal fluctuation of magnetization which depends on an external magnetic field and generates spin fluctuation in conduction electrons; a nonmagnetic conductive material which is laminated on the first magnetic material and transfers the conduction electrons; a second magnetic material which is laminated on the nonmagnetic conductive material and generates a magnetic resonance upon injection of the conduction electrons; a first electrode electrically coupled with the first magnetic material; and a second electrode electrically coupled with the second magnetic material.

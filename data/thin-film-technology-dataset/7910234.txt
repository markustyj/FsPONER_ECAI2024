 A magnetic recording tape includes an elongated substrate and a magnetic side. The magnetic side includes a support layer formed over the substrate and a magnetic recording layer formed over the support layer to define a magnetic recording surface opposite the substrate. The magnetic recording layer includes magnetic particles and a lubricant and supports a net uncompressed density of at least 30 MB/in.sup.2. The magnetic side has an extracted BET surface area of greater than 1.0 m.sup.2/g.

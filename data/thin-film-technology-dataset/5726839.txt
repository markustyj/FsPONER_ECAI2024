A magnetic head for vertical magnetic recording includes a return portion having a sufficiently large area confronting a magnetic recording medium, a main pole having its front end portion confronting the magnetic recording medium, a magneto-resistive film provided in the middle of a magnetic circuit, including the return portion, the main pole, and the magnetic recording medium. The magnetic head has its initial magnetization set in the direction virtually orthogonal to the direction of flux in the magnetic circuit. A first and a second terminal are connected to both ends of the magneto-resistive film. The magnetic circuit also includes a bypass magnetic path magnetically connecting the main pole with the return portion.

An overcoat for sufficiently preventing mechanical wear of a magnetic head slider caused by contact with a magnetic record medium is provided in a thin film head of a magnetic disk device.The magnetic head slider is provided with the overcoat constituted by a film including two layers of a silicon layer that is an adhesive layer and a diamond-like carbon layer that is a protective layer and the silicon layer includes nitrogen component. Further, nitrogen concentration of the silicon layer 2 ranges from 1 through 57%.The thickness of the silicon layer ranges from 5 through 300 angstroms and the thickness of the carbon layer ranges from 10 through 500 angstroms.

A thin-film magnetic head comprising a stratified build-up on a non-magnetic substrate for a recording medium that can be magnetized perpendicularly comprises a ring-head-like conduction body having two magnet legs, of which the poles facing the recording medium are arranged in tandem as seen in the direction of motion of the head, and having a predetermined distance from each other, and an at least largely flat coil winding, the turns of which extend through a space formed between the magnet legs. With this magnetic head, it is possible to generate a sufficiently high read voltage and to provide a magnetic head wherein the write and read function can be switched. To this end, the conduction body carrying the magnetic flux comprises, besides the ring-head-like head part formed by the two magnet legs, a leg part extending beyond the head part. Furthermore, besides the one coil winding serving only for the read function, an additional, at least largely flat coil winding is provided for the write function, this winding being arranged magnetically and geometrically separated from the read coil winding, one of the magnet legs of the ring-head-like head part and the extended leg part having corresponding geometric dimensions extending between these coil windings.

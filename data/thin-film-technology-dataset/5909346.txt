A thin film magnetic head assembly is provided which includes a plurality of thin film heads situated atop a common substrate. An insulative main body is built up layer by layer on the substrate. A plurality of magnetic yokes exhibiting different geometries are situated on the substrate and within the main body. The magnetic yokes are built up layer by layer at the same time that the insulative main body is fabricated. A plurality of coil structures are situated within the main body and are magnetically coupled to respective magnetic yokes. The head assembly also includes a pedestal of insulative material situated atop the main body and exhibiting a lateral dimension less than that of the main body. The pedestal protrudes upwardly away from the main body and substrate. The magnetic yokes each include a pole piece pair situated atop the pedestal, each pole piece pair including first and second magnetic pole pieces. Each pole piece pair exhibits a different geometry than another pole piece pair. Each pole piece pair forms a head which is adapted to reading/writing a track on a magnetic medium, the tracks of which are compatible with the geometry of that pole piece pair.

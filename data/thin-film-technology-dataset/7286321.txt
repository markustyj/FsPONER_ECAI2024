 Within a space surrounded by a lower core layer, an upheaval layer, and a back gap layer, there are a plurality of first coil pieces arranged in a height direction and covered with a coil insulating layer. On the coil insulating layer, the upheaval layer, and a layered product formed on the back gap layer, a plurality of second coil pieces are arranged in the height direction with an insulating layer therebetween. Between the lower core layer and the first coil pieces, raised layers are formed, and the first coil pieces are in contact with the second coil pieces on connection surfaces exposed from the coil insulating layer on the raised layers.

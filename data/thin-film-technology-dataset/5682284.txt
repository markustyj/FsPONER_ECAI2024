An improved magnetoresistive head design including a front curved sense contact, a back curved sense contact and a lip extension forming an elliptical sensor region is disclosed. Current flows perpendicularly to the contact edges and intersects the MR element's magnetization vector at 45 degrees. A symmetrical read sensitivity function is the result of constant magnetic flux associated with an elliptical sense region.

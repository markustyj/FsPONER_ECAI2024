 A recording head for use in magnetic storage devices is disclosed. The recording head includes a transducer that is bi-directionally movable with respect to a surface of the magnetic storage medium, thereby enabling improved positioning of the transducer during recording head read and write operations. Various structures are disclosed to bi-directionally actuate the recording head transducer. In one embodiment, an interleaver assembly having a plurality of flexure assemblies employs a motor including magnetic portions for selective, bi-directional actuation. In another embodiment, electrostatic charges are employed in the flexure assemblies for selective actuation. In yet another embodiment, piezoelectric elements are included to provide for selective actuation.

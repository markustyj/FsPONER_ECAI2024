A method for fabricating a thin film magnetic head is provided in which a magnetic yoke assembly is built up, layer by layer, atop a substrate using semiconductor thin film techniques. The lower yoke assembly is first formed and includes a lower magnetic layer situated on the substrate and first and second side poles built up vertically from the ends of the lower magnetic layer. An insulative pedestal surrounded by a frame is formed at the top of the lower yoke assembly and extends above the uppermost lateral plane of the yoke assembly. First and second pole pieces are plated on the first and second side poles through openings in the pedestal. A diamond-like carbon (DLC) protective wear layer is deposited atop the pedestal and pole pieces. The wear layer and pole pieces are machined to form the upper head surface. The magnetic pole pieces recede below the surface of the wear layer during machining. The wear layer is then plasma etched until the wear layer and the pole pieces are in substantially the same plane. In this manner, the head is provided with wear protection and at the same time the pole pieces are so close to the magnetic recording media that the reading and writing of data are enhanced.

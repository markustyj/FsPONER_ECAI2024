A photographic still camera includes a magnetic head for recording information on a magnetic surface of photographic film. The head is supported on a carriage which is mounted on a film platen for movement relative to the platen perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the film. A spring mounted on the carriage is provided with spring arms that bias the carriage toward the longitudinal axis of the film so that a pair of pins extending from the carriage engage an edge of the film to maintain a precise relationship between the recorded information track and the film edge. A pressure pad carried by another arm of the spring urges the film into contact with the head. The platen carriage, head, spring and pressure head form a modular assembly which can be conveniently mounted into a photographic still camera.

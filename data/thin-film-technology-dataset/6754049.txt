Perpendicular recording and magnetoresistive sensing transducers are disclosed having additional coil windings carrying current in an opposite direction to windings encircled by a core. The magnetic influence of the recording transducer on the sense transducer is reduced or eliminated. The inductance of the coils used to drive the recording transducer is reduced, facilitating high-frequency operation. Moreover, the magnetic flux induced by the coils and transmitted by the recording pole tip is increased, improving recording capabilities.

Disclosed are a method of manufacturing a magnetic head slider and a method of fixing row bars, which realize improved fabrication accuracy without increasing manufacturing costs and can prevent adhesion of a foreign matter to a magnetic head slider. After forming a number of thin film magnetic head devices on a wafer by thin film process, the wafer is cut into a plurality of row bars. Before a rail is formed in a predetermined surface of each of the row bars by photolithography, a surface opposite to the surface to be processed of the row bar is bonded and fixed to a support substrate of a wafer shape. A protective film obtained by conducting a heat treatment on a polyimide precursor at temperature lower than temperature at which the polyimide precursor becomes polyimide is formed on the surface of the support substrate. A curing agent film containing a curing agent which promotes setting of the adhesive for bonding the row bars is formed on the surface of the protective film. After applying the adhesive on the surface of the curing agent film, when the surface opposite to the surface to be processed of the row bar is pressed against the adhesive, the adhesive promptly sets by the action of the curing agent. Thus, the row bars can be promptly bonded and fixed to the support substrate. Since the support substrate is covered with the protective film, the support substrate can be prevented from being damaged during the processing of the row bars.

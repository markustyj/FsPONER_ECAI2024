A horizontal magnetic reading head for a perpendicular recording on a magnetic tape.A magnetic layer (50,51,52) is interrupted by two spacers arranged symmetrically with respect to the plane of a monopole (56). A U-shaped magnetoresistant element is constituted by two ribbons (34,35) parallel to the monopole and respectively located in the two spacers of the magnetic layer. The two ribbons are joined by a magnetoresistant bridge (36). Optionally, the head can have a conductor coil so that it could write in addition to read.

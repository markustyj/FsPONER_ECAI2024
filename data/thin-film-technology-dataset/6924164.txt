A method of making a thin-film device including a substrate-supply station that supplies a substrate. The substrate has a first layer on the substrate. Also described is a method and device for depositing a second layer onto the first layer, wherein energy supplied to the second layer aids in layer formation without substantially heating the substrate. Some embodiments include depositing a photovoltaic cell. In some embodiments, the substrate is a flexible material supplied from a roll. Some embodiments include attaching an integrated circuit to the substrate and operatively coupling the integrated circuit to charge the battery from the photovoltaic cell.

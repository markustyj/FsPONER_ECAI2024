 Embodiments of the present invention recite a process for fabricating a write gap structure for a magnetic recording head. In one embodiment, at least one layer of inert material is deposited which is disposed proximate to the P2 pole of a magnetic recording head. A layer of magnetic material is deposited which is disposed between the layer of inert material and the P1 pedestal (P1P) of the magnetic recording head. In embodiments of the present invention, a second layer of inert material is deposited which is disposed between the layer of magnetic material and the P1P of the magnetic recording head. In embodiments of the present invention, the throat height of the write gap structure is defined wherein the layer of magnetic material and the inert layer only overlie a portion of the P1 pedestal of the magnetic recording head.

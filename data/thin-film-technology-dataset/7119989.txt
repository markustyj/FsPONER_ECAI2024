 A thin-film magnetic head comprises first and second magnetic pole groups, magnetically connected to each other, having respective magnetic pole parts opposing each other on a side of a medium-opposing surface; a recording gap layer formed between the magnetic pole parts; and a thin-film coil insulated from the first and second magnetic pole groups and wound helically about at least one of them or flatly spirally wound about a junction connecting the first and second magnetic pole groups to each other; which are laminated on a substrate. The thin-film coil comprises a first conductor group having a plurality of inner conductor parts disposed between the first and second magnetic pole groups, and a second conductor group having a plurality of outer conductor parts disposed outside the second magnetic pole group or junction. The first conductor group has an insulating contact structure in which the inner conductor parts are in contact with each other by way of an insulating film. An inner relaxing part comprising a material softer than at least one of the first, second conductor groups and the first, second magnetic pole groups and being in contact with the first conductor group by way of an insulating film is provided.

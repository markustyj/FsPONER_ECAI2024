A method of manufacturing a thin-film magnetic head comprises the steps of forming a bottom pole layer, forming a gap layer, forming a top pole layer, and forming a thin-film coil. The thin-film coil is wound around the top pole layer in a helical manner. In the step of forming the bottom pole layer, the bottom pole layer is formed to include a first layer facing a portion of the thin-film coil, and a second layer that forms a pole portion and is connected to a surface of the first layer facing the top pole layer. In the step of forming the thin-film coil, a portion of the coil is disposed on a side of the second layer and another portion of the coil is disposed over the top pole layer via an insulating film.

A magnetoresistance element has a structure of a magnetic film 3, a nonmagnetic film 2 and a magnetic film 1 layered successively, and the nonmagnetic film is made of a mixture of electrical conductors and insulators. Then, magnetic coupling between the magnetic films 1 and 3 is reduced. Further, because it is possible to detect a magnetic field by supplying a current along a film plane, a large change in magnetoresistance is observed, or the sensitivity is high. Modified magnetoresistance elements are also described including a film 4 suppressing magnetization reversal or an interface magnetic film 5. A magnetic head for a hard disk is produced by adding a yoke to the magnetoresistance element. A memory device having a plurality of magnetoresistance elements is produced by adding word lines and the like thereto.

 A slider for use in a disk drive system with a read/write head that has a write coil as part of a write transducer. The write coil has a center tap thereon for connection to a conductor in addition to the connection of the ends of the write coil to two other conductors. This allows the write coil to be driven from opposite ends with opposite but equal currents in addition to the write currents that are used in write mode or alone in modes other than in write mode, such as just before write mode is entered. The current flowing in or out of the center tap then will be the sum of the currents flowing out or into the opposite ends of the write coil. In this manner, no magnetic fringing field is created since the currents/fields cancel each other out. Also, the power dissipation in the write coil during this time will be approximately the same as in write mode and a similar amount of pole tip protrusion should be produced thereby.

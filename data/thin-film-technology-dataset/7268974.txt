 A magnetic write head for a data storage device includes a pole piece layer; a pole tip structure formed over the pole piece layer; a trailing shield formed at least in part along an air bearing surface (ABS) of the magnetic head adjacent the pole tip structure; a non-magnetic gap layer formed between the trailing shield and the pole tip structure; a yoke structure formed over at least part of the trailing shield; and a notch formed in the yoke structure adjacent the pole tip structure. Advantageously, the notch reduces magnetic flux otherwise drawn by the yoke structure in the region directly adjacent the pole tip structure. A method of making the magnetic head is also disclosed.

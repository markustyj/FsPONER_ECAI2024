A process for producing a thin-film magnetic tape head includes the steps of coating a substrate with a layer of material which protects the substrate from an etchant. A cavity is etched into the substrate and a prismoid of magnet material is deposited in the cavity. The sides of the substrate are removed so that the prismoid projects above the sides for a substantial portion of the height of the prismoid. The substrate is coated with a gap-coating layer and the gap-coating is removed from one side of the prismoid. Another layer of magnetic material is deposited onto the substrate and various parts, such as pole shoes, are formed. The substrate is polished and the apex of the prismoid is removed. Head windings are made. A return path for the head windings is provided by depositing another layer of magnetic material onto the substrate. A protective layer of a metal oxide is deposited onto the substrate.

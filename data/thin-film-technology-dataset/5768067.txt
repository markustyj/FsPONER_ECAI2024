A magnetoresistive head including a magnetoresistive film formed in a read-track region, and antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic films are formed on each end of the magnetoresistive film outside of the read-track region such that bias magnetization is applied to the magnetoresistive film by exchange coupling between the antiferromagnetic film and the ferromagnetic film. A nonmagnetic intermediate film is formed between the ferromagnetic film and the magnetoresistive film for preventing ferromagnetic coupling on a contact boundary surface between the ferromagnetic film and the magnetoresistive film. In accordance with another aspect, a magnetoresistive head includes an antiferromagnetic layer formed from an X--Mn alloy, where X is an element selected from the group consisting of Pt, Rh, Ru, Tr, and Pd. An interdiffusion layer is formed between the antiferromagnetic film and a ferromagnetic layer or a pinned magnetic layer by heat treatment.

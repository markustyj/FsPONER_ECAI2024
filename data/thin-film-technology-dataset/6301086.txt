A thin-film magnetic head supporting structure includes: an FeAlSi alloy film; a ceramic substrate used for structural support of the FeAlSi alloy film; and an intermediate multilayer structure disposed between the FeAlSi alloy film and the ceramic substrate. The intermediate multilayer structure includes a Cr film and an Fe film, which are stacked in this order over the ceramic substrate.

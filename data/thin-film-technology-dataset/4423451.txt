A thin film magnetic read/write transducer has a substrate of magnetic material forming a pair of disparate pole pieces. Arranged adjacent a movable magnetic medium, the disparate pole pieces are constructed so that the leading pole piece has a greater distal surface area than the trailing pole piece. In an alternative arrangement the leading pole piece distal surface is disposed a greater distance from the medium than the trailing pole piece. In yet another arrangement the trailing pole piece distal surface is disposed at an acute angle to the medium, and the leading pole piece surface may be at a lesser angle or parallel to the medium. The disparate pole pieces, so constructed and arranged, introduce compensating non-linearities to the writing magnetic field to substantially counteract the non-linear properties of the medium and of the recording process.

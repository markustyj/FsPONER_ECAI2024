 A method of manufacturing a thin-film magnetic head may include forming a first magnetic layer, a thin-film coil, an insulating layer, a gap layer, and a second magnetic layer. The first magnetic layer may be formed to include a first pole portion and a first yoke portion. The second magnetic layer may be formed to include a second pole portion and a second yoke portion. At least part of the thin-film coil may be located on a side of the first pole portion and between the gap layer and the first yoke portion, and may be covered with the gap layer. A surface of the first pole portion that faces toward the gap layer and a surface of the insulating layer that faces toward the gap layer may together form one flat surface. An interface region between the second pole portion and the second yoke portion may be formed to face toward the one flat surface.

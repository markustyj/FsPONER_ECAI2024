A process for producing a coil for a magnetic recording head and the coil obtained by this process. An insulating film which covers a support is etched in order to give it the shape of a first spiral. The support is then etched by using the insulating film as a mask, forming a groove in the form of a second spiral, which is complementary to the first spiral. A thin metal layer is then deposited on the insulating film used as the mask and simultaneously on the bottom of the etched groove, producing two conductors in the form of complementary spirals which are located in two different planes.

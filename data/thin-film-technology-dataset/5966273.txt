In a magnetoresistive thin film head including a magnetoresistive element, lead layers for supplying a sense current to the magnetoresistive element and an insulating layer provided in the vicinity of the magnetoresistive element, the insulating layer is formed of a material which has an electrical resistivity greater than 1.times.10.sup.4 .OMEGA.cm and a thermal conductivity greater than 100 W/(mK). The insulating layer may be formed of silicon, diamond-like carbon or the like so as to have an electrical resistivity and a thermal conductivity within the ranges defined above.

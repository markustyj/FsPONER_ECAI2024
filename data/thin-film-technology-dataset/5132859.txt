A magnetic thin film structure comprising a first layer of magnetic material having a low anisotropy H.sub.k magnetically coupled to a second layer magnetic material having a high anisotropy H.sub.k and a low coercivity. The laminate provides a dual anisotropy behavior such that the laminate exhibits a high initial permeability at relatively small applied fields during the read operation and a high anisotropy at high applied fields during the write operation. The laminate of the present invention reduces inductive head domain instability produced by the write operation while maintaining high reproducing sensitivity during the read operation. Use of the higher H.sub.k material also reduces the sensitivity of the head performance to variation in process-induced stresses.

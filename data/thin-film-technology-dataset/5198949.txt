A thin film magnetic head has a lower magnetic layer and an upper magnetic layer formed over the lower magnetic layer so that a small gap is formed between a magnetic gap section of the lower magnetic layer near a sliding surface to be brought into sliding contact with a magnetic recording medium and a magnetic gap section of the upper magnetic layer extending in parallel to the magnetic gap section of the lower magnetic layer near the sliding surface. The upper magnetic layer has a first sloping section extending from the magnetic gap section at an inclination .theta..sub.1 in a range defined by 2.degree..ltoreq..theta..sub.1 .ltoreq.25.degree. to the upper surface of the lower magnetic layer, and a second sloping section extending from the first sloping section at an inclination .theta..sub.2 in a range defined by: 30.degree..ltoreq..theta..sub.2 .ltoreq.80.degree. to the upper surface of the lower magnetic layer. Magnetic flux leaks across the lower magnetic layer and the first inclined section of the upper magnetic layer, so that the magnetic saturation of the magnetic gap section of the upper magnetic layer is prevented. Since the second sloping section is inclined at a large inclination, the overwrite characteristics is not deteriorated.

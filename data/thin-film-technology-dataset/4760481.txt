Disclosed is a thin film magnetic head having a structure wherein the main portion of a coil consists of a copper or copper alloy layer and its upper surface is covered with a thin film mask consisting of titanium, titanium oxide, chromium and/or chromium oxide. The magnetic head of the invention can prevent the occurrence of projecting etching residues at the upper edge portion of the coil and can easily increase the cross-sectional area and the winding density of the coil. Furthermore, when the thin film mask consists of titanium and/or titanium oxide, a titanium diffusion prevention film consisting of chromium, for example, is interposed between the thin film mask and the copper or copper alloy, so that the resistance change of the coil scarcely takes place owing to heat treatment in a production process after the formation of the coil and the head reliability can be further improved.

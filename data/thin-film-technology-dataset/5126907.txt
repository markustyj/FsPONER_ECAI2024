A thin film magnetic head has a first magnetic core member carried by a substrate, a gap layer formed on the first magnetic core member, and a second magnetic core member formed in a spaced relation with the first magnetic core member. The second magnetic core member is coupled to the first magnetic core member to form a magnetic path and to have an end portion of the gap layer sandwiched by gap defining portions of the first and second magnetic core members. A coil conductor is wound about the magnetic path. In one embodiment, the first magnetic core member includes a first magnetic layer made of a magnetic material having stable magnetic properties during heat treatment and the second magnetic core member includes a second magnetic layer made of a material having a saturation flux density higher than that of the material of the first magnetic core member.

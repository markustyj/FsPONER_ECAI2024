A method of measuring variation in dimensions and alignment error of thin film magnetic heads formed on a raw bar cut-off from a substrate is provided. Such method comprises illuminating a MR element and a resistance detector element which is formed for monitoring a lapping process, both of which are formed on the raw bar, with illuminating light whose wavelength is 300 nm or less; forming an image by imaging light reflected from the elements; and converting the image to an image signal through photoelectric conversion so as to detect variation in dimensions of the MR element and the resistance detector element formed on the raw bar, and alignment error between the MR element and the resistance detector element with a high degree of accuracy.

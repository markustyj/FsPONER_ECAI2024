Disclosed is a magnetic transducer using a magnetoresistance effect, comprising a magnetoresistive film, a hard magnetic film for applying a transverse biasing magnetic field thereto, and a conductive film through which current for applying the transverse biasing magnetic field to the magnetoresistive film flows. The conductive film may be either in electrical contact with or in electrical insulation from the magnetoresistive film. In this magnetic transducer, even when the heights of the respective constituents have changed, the transverse biasing magnetic field to be applied does not change considerably, and an optimum bias field strength is readily attained.

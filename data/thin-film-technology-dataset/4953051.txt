A composite magnetic head is disclosed which is characterized by the fact that a magnetic head slider part and magnetic head core pieces both made of non-magnetic ceramic and provided on each of the opposed surfaces thereof with at least one layer of soft magnetic film produced in the form of sheet and subsequently shaped as required are integrally joined through the medium of glass members interposed between the opposed surfaces so as to give rise to a magnetic gap and an electromagnetic transducer coil is wound on the magnetic head core pieces.A composite magnetic head is further disclosed which is characterized by the fact that a magnetic head slider part and magnetic head core pieces, one made of an oxide magnetic material and the other made of a non-magnetic ceramic, are integrally joined through the medium of glass members interposed between pertinent opposed surfaces so as to give rise to a magnetic gap, the member made of the non-magnetic ceramic is provided on the opposed surface thereof with at least one layer of soft magnetic film produced in the form of sheet and subsequently shaped as required, and an electromagnetic transducer coil is wound on the magnetic head core pieces.

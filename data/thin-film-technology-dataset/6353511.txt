A preferred embodiment provides a thin film write head having upper and lower pole structures each having pedestal pole tips formed with CoNiFe. The pedestal pole tips may have from about 60% to about 70% Co and from about 10% to about 15% Ni. The upper pole structure of the preferred embodiment has a laminated yoke portion having upper and lower layers. The lower layer is stitched to the pedestal pole tip of the upper pole structure and comprises FeXN, where X is selected from the group consisting of Rh, Ta, Hf, Al, Zr, Ti, Ru, Si, Cr, V, Si, Sr, Nb, Mo, Ru, and Pd. The upper layer comprises NiFe preferably having from about 15% to about 55% of Fe. It is preferred to define the lower layer of the yoke by etching FeXN material using the upper layer as a hard mask. In a preferred method and embodiment, the top surfaces of the conductor coil and the upper pedestal pole tip are planarized with an inorganic capping layer formed thereover to insulate the conductor coil from the yoke and to provide a low apex angle to form the yoke over.

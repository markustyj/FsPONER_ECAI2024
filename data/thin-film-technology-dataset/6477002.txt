The constitution includes a common shield having both shield function and lower magnetic core function, a recording gap formed on the common shield, having specified gap length and gap depth, an upper magnetic core disposed oppositely to the common shield through the recording gap, and a pair of shunt members made of a soft magnetic material formed at the side of the recording gap, being magnetically insulated from the common shield and upper magnetic core through a nonmagnetic layer. It hence presents a thin film magnetic head and its manufacturing method capable of suppressing the leak magnetic field generated in the recording gap, decreasing the recording fringe substantially, narrowing the track of the recording head, and enhancing the recording track density.

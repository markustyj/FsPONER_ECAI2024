A read/write head for use in a magnetic storage device in a digital data processing system for writing data in the form of magnetic flux onto, and reading data from a spinning magnetic disk. The head has two magnetic pole pieces each with a yoke region which tapers to a pole tip and an energizable coil situated between the pole pieces in the yoke region for generating magnetic flux. One of the pole pieces has a slot in the yoke region, and a strip of magneto-resistive material is situated adjacent the slot. The magneto-resistive strip is adapted to be connected to sensing equipment which measures variations in the resistance of the magneto-resistive strip in response to the variations in the magnetic flux recorded on the media. Several slots may be formed in the pole pieces, and an elongated magneto-resistive strip may be situated adjacent the slots.

A magnetic thin-film head for a recording medium that can be magnetized vertically comprises a ring head-like conduction body which carries the magnetic flux and is applied to a nonmagnetic substrate. The conduction body has two magnet legs, the end pole pieces of which are arranged with a small gap width from each other and which have leg parts which are spaced wider than the gap width, and between which the turns of a write/read coil winding extend. This magnetic head provide manufacturing advantages, can be produced with high reproducibility and provides a high efficiency in the write and read function. The substrate is equipped with a depression, in which, at least largely, the leg part of one of the magnet legs and the turns of the write/read coil winding are disposed.

A magnetoresistive (MR) read transducer comprising an MR layer having passive end regions separated by a central active region. A longitudinal bias is produced by a thin film of hard magnetic material in the end regions only, and the thin film of hard magnetic material is spaced from the MR layer by a nonmagnetic spacer layer so that a magnetostatic longitudinal bias is produced of a level to maintain the passive end regions of the MR layer in a stable state.

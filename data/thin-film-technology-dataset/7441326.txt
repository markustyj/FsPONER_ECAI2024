 In a magnetic sensor, a lower terminal layer, a magnetosensitive layer, and a cover film are simultaneously patterned into substantially the same size. The opposing surface of the lower terminal layer, which opposes the magnetosensitive film is substantially superposed on one opposing surface of the magnetosensitive film. The opposing surface of the upper terminal layer, which opposes the magnetosensitive film is formed into a shape smaller than and included in the other opposing surface of the magnetosensitive film. This implements a magnetic sensor which uses a CPP structure and is yet readily processible and which includes a substantially accurate fine CPP structure in accordance with a desired output.

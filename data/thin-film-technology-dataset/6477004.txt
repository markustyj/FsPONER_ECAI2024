In a thin film magnetic head including a first magnetic layer 36, a write gap layer 41 and a second magnetic layer 42, 47 formed on a substrate 31, 32 and one or more thin film coil layers provided between the first and second magnetic layers, in order to shorten a magnetic path length of the thin film coil and to improve characteristics by reducing a spacing between successive coil windings of at least one thin film coil layer, a silicon oxide film 37 is formed on the first magnetic layer 36, coil-shaped recesses 38 are formed by a reactive ion etching in a surface of the silicon oxide layer with a narrow spacing, a copper layer is deposited by Cu-CVD, the copper layer is polished by CMP such that the surface of the silicon oxide layer is exposed to form coil windings 40 of the first thin film coil layer, and the write gap layer is formed on the coil windings. Since an inorganic insulating layer made of silicon oxide, silicon nitride or alumina which can be subjected to a fine processing by a reactive ion etching is used, the coil windings 40 can be formed with an extremely small spacing such as 0.3-0.5 .mu.m.

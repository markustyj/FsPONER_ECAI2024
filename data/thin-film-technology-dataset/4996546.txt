Magnetic recording apparatus for a photographic still camera comprises a fixed magnetic head mounted on a film platen. The head is adapted to contact a magnetic coating on the film adjacent the image area of the film. A pressure pad is mounted in the camera on the opposite side of the film and positioned in close proximity to the film. The pressure pad is biased by a spring to apply pressure on the head through pressure on the film to assure that the film is in intimate contact with the head when the film is advancing. During film exposure when the film is stationary, the pressure pad is retracted to avoid distortion of the image plane.

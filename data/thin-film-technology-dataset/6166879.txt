A method of fabricating thin film magnetic heads on a thin film substrate uses a chemical-mechanical contouring (CMC) step after completion of the fundamental thin film head structure to form a curved surface on the substrate for the individual thin film magnetic heads of a substantial plurality of heads on a thin film substrate. A special CMC process utilizes a soft polishing pad, applying mechanical contouring motion at a slow speed, typically on the order of 1/3 a typical conventional CMP rotational speed, and at a relatively high pressure, typically two to three times a typical conventional CMP applied pressure.

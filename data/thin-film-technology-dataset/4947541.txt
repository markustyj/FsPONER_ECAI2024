A lower core is formed on the surface of a wafer and then a protection film made of substance that has a lower ion milling rate than that of the lower core is formed so as to coat the lower core. Then, the protection film is ground to expose the lower core under the film, and the surface of the protection film and that of the lower core are finished smooth and level. Then, ion beams are radiated to simultaneously mill both the protection film and the lower core and thereby form a recess above the lower core. Next, a gap layer is formed on the surfaces of both the protection film and the lower core. Then, an upper core is formed in the recess above the lower core with a gap layer between them. Accordingly, only the part in which the pole of the upper core and the pole of the lower core face each other in parallel is magnetically effective. This ensures a constant track width even in mass production provided that only the lower core is formed strictly in accordance with the design. In this case, formation of a lower core in accordance with the design is possible. Further, since the surplus part of the upper core does not actually provide a read/write function of a head, cross-talk is seldom generated between adjacent tracks. Conducting milling before forming an upper core elminates magnetic shortcircuiting between the upper and lower cores.

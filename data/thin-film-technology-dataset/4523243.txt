An improved magnetoresistive transducer for sensing the magnetic fields recorded on a magnetic medium and suitable for fabrication using photolithographic techniques. The transducer has two separate metallization layers so that the bias conductor may be deposited opposite the magnetoresistive sense element without any electrical connection between the two, thereby allowing the sense currents and bias currents to each be independently optimized and allowing the same bias current to be used to bias each magnetoresistive transducer element in an array. The bias conductor is set back from the edge of the magnetoresistive transducer element which is closest to the magnetic medium, providing a number of advantages related to wear, to decreasing the possibility of a short circuit between the bias conductor and the transducer element, and to reducing the exposure of the bias conductor to environmental hazards.

A thin film magnetic head has a sharply defined zero throat location in the pole tip members utilizing a superior magnetic pole tip material having high resistivity and high magnetic induction. The zero throat location is defined by first depositing a first pole tip member on a first magnetic pole member which may be formed by plating and need not be composed of the same superior magnetic material as the first pole tip member. By etching the zero throat edge of the first pole tip member, a clearly defined edge location is produced. The second pole tip member of superior magnetic material is then deposited on an insulating gap layer which is formed on the lower pole tip member.

 A chemical-mechanical nanogrinding process achieves near-zero pole tip recession (PTR) to minimize magnetic space loss of the head transducer to media spacing loss, alumina recession and trailing edge profile variation, and smooth surface finish with minimal smearing across multi-layers of thin films and the hard substrate to meet the requirements of high areal density thin film magnetic heads for hard disk drives (HDD). With a fine chemical mechanical nanogrinding process, PTR can be improved to a mean of about 0.5 nm.

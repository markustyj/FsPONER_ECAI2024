A process for fabricating a thin film magnetic head to achieve improved dimensions and tolerances of the pole tip portion of the head. A lower thin film magnetic layer comprising the lower pole tip is first formed followed by a thin layer defining the gap of the head. A thin film magnetic layer is then deposited only in the vicinity of the pole tip to define the upper pole of the head. Following this, successive layers of insulation and coils are deposited. Finally, a top thin film magnetic layer is deposited. This top layer contacts the already formed layer comprising the top pole piece.

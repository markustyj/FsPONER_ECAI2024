A method of forming an oxide film over the substrate of an electronic device. In one embodiment, a first metal oxide film layer is deposited on the substrate of the electronic device by bias sputtering. Then, a second metal oxide film layer is deposited by ion beam sputtering on the first metal oxide film layer. In another embodiment, a first metal oxide film layer is deposited on the substrate of the electronic device by ion beam sputtering. Then, a second metal oxide film layer is deposited by bias sputtering on the first metal oxide film layer. In yet another embodiment, a first metal oxide film layer having a first degree of purity is deposited on the substrate of the electronic device. Then, a second metal oxide film layer having a second degree of purity is deposited on the first metal oxide film layer. The first degree of purity is different than the second degree of purity.

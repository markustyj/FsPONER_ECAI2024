Thin-film magnetic head has a layer structure for vertical magnetization. The magnetic head is constructed in thin-film technology and is guided over a recording medium to be magnetized vertically. The head includes a ring core head magnetic guide body with a first and second magnetic shank which form sequentially arranged magnetic poles. The write function is carried out with the first magnetic shank and both magnetic shanks carry out the read function. This magnetic head is constructed so that the concomitant reading of data residues in the margin regions of data tracks is prevented. To this end the magnetic pole of the first magnetic shank has a greater width than the magnetic pole of the second magnetic shank with both magnetic shanks being constructed largely of the same material at least in their end regions bordering on the magnetic poles.

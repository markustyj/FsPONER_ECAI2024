A magnetic head structure including a magnetoresistive (MR) head and an inductive head for data storage devices such as tape drives. A method of fabricating a magnetic head utilizing semiconductor-type processing techniques is described that produces an inductive head gap having a substantially flat planar structure throughout in length which, in one embodiment, has a length of 150 microns and a height of one micron. The structure includes a first and second shield, and an MR layer formed therebetween that includes an MR sensor adjacent to the air bearing surface (ABS), leads connected on opposite sides of the MR sensor, and isolated segments situated between the leads and extending all the way to the ABS. A trench (i.e. gap) is formed between the leads and the segments. Preferably, the leads and the segments are deposited simultaneously, and the insulating gap is formed subsequently by photoresist and masking techniques. By isolating the segments electrically, the leads are isolated from short circuits appearing across the ABS, thereby reducing noise, enhancing reliability and providing better performance, while at the same time providing a substantially flat structure upon which to form the inductive head and thereby provide a substantially uniform inductive head gap. Embodiments include merged heads and piggyback heads.

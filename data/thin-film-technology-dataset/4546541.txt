A method of attaching electrical conductors to a thin film magnetic transducer having a transducing element and a plurality of substantially planar conductive leads formed into a predetermined pattern comprising the steps of mounting the thin film magnetic transducer on a substrate adjacent a medium contacting surface with the conductive leads thereof extending from the medium contacting surface, positioning an electrical circuit member having on one side thereof a plurality of planar connecting elements which have a relatively thin diffusible conductive metal coating contiguous the conductive leads, placing a quantity of curable epoxy bonding material adjacent the plurality of planar connecting elements of the thin film transducer wherein the epoxy bonding material is selected of a material having a curing temperature which is less than the thermal stress temperature of a thin film magnetic transducer wherein at least one of the electrical characteristics and the magnetic characteristics of the thin film magnetic transducer are permanently destroyed, controllably heating the subassembly and urging the substrate and the plurality of planar connecting elements of the electrical circuit member together with a clamping force at a temperature in a bonding temperature range for a time period sufficient to enable the epoxy bonding material to substantially fill by capillary action the space between the substrate and the electrical circuit member and to enable the conductive leads of the thin film magnetic transducer to bond with the connecting elements to form a subassembly is shown.

A magnetoresistive (MR) head includes an MR film that has a bottom edge to be positioned adjacent to a magnetic medium, a first side with a first outside edge, and a second side with a second outside edge. The first outside edge extends in a direction that forms an obtuse angle with the bottom edge. A first lead layer is electrically connected to the magnetoresistive film at the first outside edge, and a second lead layer is electrically connected to the magnetoresistive film at the second outside edge. Because of the orientation of the first outside edge of the MR film, magnetic flux from the magnetic medium is more likely to propagate through the MR film without being impeded by the first outside edge, and thus the read sensitivity profile of the MR head is improved. In a preferred embodiment, the first and the second outside edges of the MR film both include a lower portion substantially perpendicular to the bottom edge and an upper portion extending in a direction that forms an obtuse angle with the bottom edge. This minimizes variation in the width of the MR film due to lapping height tolerance because the lower portions of the first and second outside edges are parallel to one another. In another preferred embodiment, the height of the MR film narrows from the second outside edge to the first outside edge. This further improves the read sensitivity profile of the MR head.

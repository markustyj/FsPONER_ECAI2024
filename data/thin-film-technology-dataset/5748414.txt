A magnetoresistive (MR) element assembly with a longitudinal bias comprising a MR element, a bias coil, and spaced conductor leads is disclosed. The MR element is formed into an elongated ellipse-like shape with an elongated sense region and two end regions separated by a small nonmagnetic gap thereby reducing the longitudinal demagnetization field within the MR element. An easy axis of magnetization is formed by the MR element and oriented in a direction parallel to the main axis of the element. A bias coil is disposed about the MR element to produce a longitudinal bias field sufficient to maintain the elongated sense region in a single domain state. The elongated ellipse-like shaped MR element features a uniformly reduced demagnetization field for inhibiting the formation of a multi-domain state within the elongated sense region. The MR element assembly thus improves sensitivity of the MR head and suppresses Barkhausen noise in the output of the head.

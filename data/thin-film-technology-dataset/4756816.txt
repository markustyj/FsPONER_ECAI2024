Ferromagnetic cobalt-iron (CoFe) is electrodeposited on a conductive substrate to form a CoFe thin film. The wet electrodeposition process disclosed involves use of a relatively low toxic plating bath solution in which the constituents cobalt and iron are introduced as soluble salts. A lesser amount of iron than cobalt is used to develop an approximately 90% cobalt to 10% iron ratio in the thin film. The plating solution also has sodium saccharin, dodecyl sodium sulfate and wetting and buffering agents. The CoFe thin film that results from using the disclosed process has near zero magnetostriction, acceptable permeability for use as a magnetic head, a highly stabilized magnetic domain and approximately twice the saturation moment of Permalloy. Magnetic heads fabricated from such film are well suited for use with high coercivity media for high density recording.

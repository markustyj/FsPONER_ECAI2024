A photographic still camera for receiving an elongated filmstrip having a cross-curvature in the cross film direction across said filmstrip and having a substantially transparent magnetic layer deposited on the film surface and for recording or reproducing information on or from the magnetic layer in the image area in and relation to the exposure of image frames of the filmstrip. A magnetic head is formed of a plurality of frustums including inner frustums supporting a plurality of active head gaps in an interior region and at least one further outer frustum on each side of the inner frustums in the cross film direction. The frustums and active head gaps have a contoured height profile in the cross film direction positioned to penetrate the film plane and to wrap the filmstrip around the frustums in a cavity in the film transport path, the contoured height profile in the cross film direction ensuring elastic compliance of the active head gaps with the magnetic on film layer tracks, with or without applied film tension or film compression. Contouring is effected by lapping the head mounted in the film transport path to approximate the cross-curvature of the filmstrip.

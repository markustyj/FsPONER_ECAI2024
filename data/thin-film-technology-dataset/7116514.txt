 According to one aspect, methods and systems for determining the position of a recording head using existing data structures on magnetic storage media are provided. In one example, a recording head writes data to an active track on a magnetic storage tape, the recording head including a write element and a read element in a known spatial relationship, wherein the read element is configured to access at least a portion of a reference track when the write element is accessing the active track. A controller determines a relative position of the transducer element to the reference track and repositions the recording head to write data to the active track. The read element may be a backward channel reader or dedicated read element of the recording head for reading reference tracks during read and/or write operations.

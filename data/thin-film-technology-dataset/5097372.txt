A thin film magnetic head includes an upper magnetic layer comprising a first yoke, a portion of which is divided into front and rear sections and which is provided near the divided sections with a magneto-resistive element, a second yoke provided adjacent to the opposite ends of the first yoke in a widthwise direction of a recording track and a third yoke provided between the first yoke and the second yoke and having a larger magnetic reluctance than those of the first and second yokes. In the above constitution, the first, second and third yokes can be mainly used in recording to record in an area of a large width on the recording medium, and only the first yoke can be used in reproducing to reproduce in an area of a small width on the recording medium, so that the reproducing output is not reduced when the recording medium experiences a running deviation.

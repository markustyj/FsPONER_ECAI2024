The back end of an MR sensor and a flux guide are joined by a contiguous self-aligned junction so that a predictable overlap of the flux guide on the back end of the MR sensor can be achieved for optimizing signal flux density in the MR sensor. Lead/longitudinal bias layers for the MR sensor are also joined by a contiguous self-aligned junction to the flux guide for stabilizing the flux guide. By employing a single lift off resist mask the MR sensor and the lead/longitudinal bias layers can be patterned followed by deposition of the flux guide. The flux guide is a bilayer of an insulation material layer and a flux guide material layer. The insulation material layer is sandwiched between the MR sensor and the flux guide material layer and between the lead/longitudinal bias layers and the flux guide material layer. A heat guide or combined flux guide and heat guide may be substituted for the aforementioned flux guide.

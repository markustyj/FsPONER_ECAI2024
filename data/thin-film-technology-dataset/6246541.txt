A thin film magnetic head has insulation between layers that can be maintained even by reducing distances between layers of thin film coils. Accordingly, a magnetic path formed by a lower magnetic core and an upper magnetic core can be reduced. The lowermost-layer thin film conductors have a substantially rectangular cross section and are provided on insulating resin layers formed on a non-magnetic thin film. The thin film conductors of the second lowermost-layer thin film coil have a downward convex bottom surface and are disposed face-to-face in between the adjoining lowermost-layer thin film conductors. The thin film conductors of the second lowermost-layer thin film coil can have a more protruded bottom surface by providing protruded portions on the insulating resin layer and the lowermost-layer thin film conductors on the protruded portions.

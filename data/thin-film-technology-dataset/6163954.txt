A slider producing method in which a slider bar is lapped from the side of a base to the side of a thin-film element of a slider, in a fixed direction substantially perpendicular to the slider bar. Thereafter, the slider bar is polished by making it reciprocate in a direction perpendicular to the lapping operation, whereby smears are removed. The slider producing method makes it possible to prevent, in the lapping process of a slider, the formation of a stepped portion between a rail and the thin-film element of the slider, and the occurrence of a short circuit at each of the element layers of the thin-film element.

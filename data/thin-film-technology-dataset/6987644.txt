 A thin film magnetic head and a method for manufacturing the same is provided, wherein first coil pieces and second coil pieces provided one above the other with a magnetic pole layer therebetween are electrically connected to each other with reliability and with ease, and the above-described magnetic pole layer can be provided on a flattened surface. A laminate provided on a coil insulation layer can be formed on a flattened surface and, therefore, the above-described magnetic pole layer can be formed into a predetermined shape. As a result, the track width can have a predetermined dimension, and the second coil pieces provided on the above-described laminate can be reliably, easily connected to the top surfaces of connection layers exposed at the top surface of the coil insulating layer.

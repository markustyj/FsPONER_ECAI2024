An MR head includes two substantially identical MR elements, separated by an insulating layer which has shorting stubs at its ends for electrically shorting the MR elements. A current applied to the MR elements splits into two currents that flow in the same direction through the substantially identical MR elements, to provide mutual bias and to serve as sense currents for detecting change in element resistance. The MR elements are biased to operate in a magnetically unsaturated mode. This results in a "bootstrapping" of short wavelength signals that effectively amplifies the reproduced signal over a broad region of the signal spectrum when the linear spacing between the MR elements is in the range of from one half to one times the half-wavelength of signals recorded on a magnetic recording medium.

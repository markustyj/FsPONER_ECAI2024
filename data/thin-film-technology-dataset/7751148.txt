 In at least one embodiment, a magnetic recording head comprising first and second linear levels of magnetic recording devices is provided. Each device in the first linear level is aligned adjacently in a row and is spaced apart from another device in the first linear level. The first linear level is perpendicular to a comparative direction of a recording media travel. The second linear level of magnetic recording devices being connected to the first linear level of magnetic recording devices. Each device in the second linear level is aligned adjacently in a row and is spaced apart from another device in the second linear level. Each device in the second linear level is aligned with an insulating gap between the each device in the first linear level.

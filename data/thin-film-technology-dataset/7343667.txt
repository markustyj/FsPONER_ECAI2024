 A side-by-side read/write head includes a self-aligned trailing shield, where a rear edge of the trailing shield is defined by the same lithography/etching process used to define a rear edge of a read sensor. A plurality of read sensor layers and a pole tip structure adjacent the read sensor layers are formed over a wafer. A non-magnetic layer is deposited over the pole tip structure. A patterned resist is then formed over both the read sensor layers and the non-magnetic layer. With the patterned resist in place, read sensor materials of the read sensor layers are etched away so as to define the rear edge of the read sensor. Non-magnetic materials of the non-magnetic layer are simultaneously etched away so as to form an etched region which defines the rear edge for the trailing shield.

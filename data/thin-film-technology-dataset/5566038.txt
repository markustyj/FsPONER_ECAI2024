A thin film transducer having electrical connections for the discharge of electrostatic charges between coil and core is disclosed. The invention provides for conductive surfaces electrically connected to the coil and core, respectively. These surfaces are selectively positioned so as to define an air gap having a breakdown voltage below that of the insulation layer separating coil and core in the transducer.

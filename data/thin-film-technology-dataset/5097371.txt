A thin-film magnetic head comprises a magnetic yoke having first and second flux conductors (3, 4) and a magneto-resistance element (7), located remotely from a head face (1). An edge portion (7a) of the magneto-resistance element (7) is located closer to the head face (1) than a second edge portion (7b). The first flux conductor (3) extends from the head face (1) to close to the first edge portion (7a) and the second flux conductor (4) extends from the head face at least to the second edge portion (7b). The magnetic head furthermore comprises a third flux conductor (5) which extends from the head face (1) to close to an end portion (16) of the first flux conductor (3) located near the first edge portion (7b). A transducing gap (17) and an inductive element (9) are located between the first and the third flux conductors (3, 5).

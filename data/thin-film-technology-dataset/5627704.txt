A giant magnetoresistive (GMR) thin film transducer employs a pair of flux guide pole members that define a magnetic transducing gap. A GMR structure formed of a stack of multiple layers is located between spaced portions of one of the flux guide pole members and away from the transducing gap. Bias current is supplied in a CPP (current perpendicular to the plane) mode. In an alternative embodiment, a plurality of such GMR structures are connected together serially to provide a larger output signal than that obtained with a single GMR stack.

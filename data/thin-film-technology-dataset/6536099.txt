In a magnetoresistive head, a marking layer is formed on at least one of the upper side of an upper shielding layer and the lower side of a lower shielding layer so as to be opposed to a magnetoresistive sensor layer. The leading ends of the magnetoresistive sensor layer and the marking layer are exposed at a medium-sliding surface on which a recording medium slides, and the leading end of the marking layer is shaped so that the length thereof in the widthwise direction is equal to the length from the leading end to the rear end of the magnetoresistive sensor layer. The center in the widthwise direction of the marking layer is placed on a straight line which intersects the magnetoresistive sensor layer via the center in the widthwise direction of the magnetoresistive sensor layer.

A magnetoresistive head includes a magnetoresistive element set back from the front end face of the head confronting a record medium for converting changes in a signal magnetic field leaking out from the record track of the record medium into changes in resistance. The magnetoresistive element is connected to a pair of terminals and a sense region is defined between both the terminals. The magnetoresistive element is magnetically coupled to a front flux guide, one end of which is exposed in the front end face of the head, at the other end of the same. The front flux guide is virtually in the form of a rectangle elongated in the direction of the width of the record track of the record medium so as to exceed the sense region of the magnetoresistive element.

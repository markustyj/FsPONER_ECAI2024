 A method and system for providing a magnetic recording head is described. The magnetic recording head has an air-bearing surface (ABS) configured to reside in proximity to a media during use. The head includes a first coil, a second coil, a main pole, and a third coil. The first coil has a first plurality of turns and is configured to carry a first write current in a first direction. The second coil has a second plurality of turns and is configured to carry a second write current in a second direction. The main pole is between the first coil and the second coil. The third coil has a third plurality of turns configured to carry a third write current in a third direction.

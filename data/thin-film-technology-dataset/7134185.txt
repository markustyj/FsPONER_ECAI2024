 A method and system for forming a microscopic transducer are described. The method and system include forming a plurality of adjoining sensor layers. The sensor layers include a first magnetically soft layer, a nonmagnetic layer on the first magnetically soft layer, and a second magnetically soft layer on the nonmagnetic layer. The method and system also include forming a sidewall over the second magnetically soft layer. The sidewall formation includes forming a base having a surface oriented substantially perpendicular to the sensor layers and depositing an electrically conductive material on the surface. The method and system also include removing a portion of the sensor layers not covered by the sidewall.

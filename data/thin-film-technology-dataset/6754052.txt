A magnetoresistive head including a first magnetic shield, a first electrode terminal provided on the first magnetic shield and having a first width, and a magnetoresistive film provided on the first electrode terminal and having a second width less than or equal to the first width. The magnetoresistive head further includes a second electrode terminal provided on the magnetoresistive film and having a third width less than or equal to the second width, and a second magnetic shield provided on the second electrode terminal. Preferably, the magnetoresistive head further includes a plug electrode for connecting the second electrode terminal to the second magnetic shield, and a plug side wall protective insulating film for covering a side wall of the plug electrode.

Magnetic recording and reproducing linear thin film head arrays particularly for use for recording and reading information on a magnetics-on-film (MOF) layer in the image area of photographic filmstrips and particularly a configuration and mounting of such heads to achieve high compliance with the relatively stiff filmstrip and MOF layer in cameras or other filmstrip handling apparatus without damaging the filmstrip. When constrained in the film transport path, the filmstrip assumes a convex cross film curvature on the MOF layer side approximated by a sixth order polynomial having even terms only. A base line for the deposition of thin film head layers of each head of the array on a linear substrate is approximated by the sixth order polynomial having even terms only. After deposition of the thin film layers, the linear head array is shaped to the cross film curvature, and the lapped head surfaces are aligned with the base line. Preferably, at least one electrical lapping guide is deposited on the substrate in relation to the linear array of magnetic head elements and the base line, wherein the head element layer height is controlled in the head fabrication processing by monitoring the electrical resistance of the electrical lapping guide during shaping of the convex curvature of the head surface.

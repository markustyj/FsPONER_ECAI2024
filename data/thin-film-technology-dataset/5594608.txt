A high efficiency write element for use with a multiple element, multiple track longitudinal magnetic tape head. The write element includes a recess formed in the surface of the substrate in which a conductive thin film coil is disposed. This places the coil windings below the surface of the substrate resulting in a planar substrate surface. The ferrite substrate also includes a trench formed in the recess which is parallel to the front gap region and filled with a nonmagnetic composition. An insulator is interposed between the conductive thin film coil and the ferrite substrate to produce a gap spacer when the ferrite substrate is mated with a closure section. The closure section is a planar nonmagnetic material having a magnetic pole piece of a high saturation magnetic flux density material deposited on its surface. The ferrite substrate and closure section are mated such that the magnetic pole piece is positioned in the front gap and the back gap of the resulting magnetic tape head module.

A method for fabricating a thin-film magnetic head comprises the steps of providing an alignment marker used for alignment in patterning processes on an insulating layer, depositing a conductor base layer on the insulating layer to bury the alignment marker underneath, growing a pattern on the conductor base layer by an electro-plating process while using said conductor base layer as an electrode, removing the conductor base layer except for a part thereof located under the pattern by a chemical etching process that acts selectively upon the conductor base layer while leaving the alignment marker and the insulating layer substantially unetched.

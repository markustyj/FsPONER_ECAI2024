The present invention relates to a process for fabricating silicon carbide films and membranes with a predetermined stress via control of the deposition parameters which comprises the following steps:a) introducing a gas mixture of silane (SiH.sub.4)/helium and ethylene at flow rates of about 1000 sccm/min. and about 10 sccm/min. into a reaction chamber;b) reacting the silane and ethylene at a temperature &gt;400.degree. C., and in a total pressure range of about 26.6 to 266 Pa, at an RF power &lt;100 W at 13.56, MHz, the reaction between said silane and ethylene being initiated and enhanced by glow discharge.In a preferred embodiment, the intrinsic film stress is tensile, and the silane and ethylene are reacted at a temperature of about 500.degree. C., in a total pressure range exceeding 106.4, Pa, and at an RF power of 75 W at 13.56 MHz. The tensile stress films may be coated with a metal absorber layer, a desired mask pattern is generated in the absorber layer, and the substrate is removed from the backside of wet etching. The resulting X-ray mask has a smooth surface, excellent dimensional stability and transparency for X-ray radiation.

A ferromagnetic tunnel effective film has a free layer, and a pinned layer and a tunnel barrier layer sandwiched between the free layer and the pinned layer. A bias magnetic field-inductive layer applies a given magnetic field to the free layer, and has its larger width than that of the ferromagnetic tunnel effective film in the bias magnetic field direction. A flux guide layer is stacked with the bias magnetic field-inductive layer, and magnetically combined with the free layer. One end of the flux guide layer constitutes a flux probe portion having its smaller width than that of the bias magnetic field-inductive layer and projecting from the ends of the bias magnetic field-inductive layer.

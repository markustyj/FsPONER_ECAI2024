A thin film magnetic head having two conductor layers provided within a magnetic circuit constituted by a first and a second magnetic member. The magnetic circuit has, at the side to which a recording medium is opposed, a portion where the first and second magnetic members are opposed to each other over a length substantially equal to a gap depth, intervening a non-magnetic gap member therebetween, and a portion ahead thereof where they are connected with each other. The edge of the gap member constitutes an aperture of the magnetic circuit. The thin film magnetic head arranged as above permits a high density recording without reducing its production yield.

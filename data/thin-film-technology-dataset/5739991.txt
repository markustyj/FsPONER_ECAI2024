A composite thin film head comprises a magnetoresistive head portion and an inductive head portion which are superposed on a substrate, the inductive head portion comprising a lower core layer disposed on one side of a gap spacer layer and adjacent to the magnetoresistive head portion, and an upper core layer disposed on the other side of the gap spacer layer. The lower core layer comprises a core portion positioned toward the upper core layer having the same width as the upper core layer in the vicinity of a medium-opposed face, and a shield portion positioned toward the magnetoresistive head portion having a larger width than the core portion in the vicinity of the medium-opposed face.

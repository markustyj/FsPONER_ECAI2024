A thin film magnetic head is provided in which the electrical insulation surrounding the conductive coil comprises a photosensitive resin which has been crosslinked by a thermally activated crosslinking agent or promotor. The addition of the thermally activated crosslinking agent or promotor greatly reduces both the cure temperature and cure time and results in enhanced dimensional stability without any deleterious effects.

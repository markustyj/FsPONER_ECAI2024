In a thin-film magnetic head manufacturing method and apparatus, lapping is continued until the MR height of a magnetoresistive sensor falls into a finish tolerance range and the lapping time from the beginning of lapping exceeds a predetermined time, thereby substantially reducing the recession between an ABS of a slider bar and a surface of a thin-film magnetic element opposing a recording medium.

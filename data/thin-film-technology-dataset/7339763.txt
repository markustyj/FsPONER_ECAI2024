 A disk drive thin-film write head has a first ferromagnetic pole tip that includes a pedestal pole layer and a capping layer on the pedestal pole layer. A substantial portion of the pedestal pole layer is formed of a lower-moment alloy and the capping layer is formed of a higher-moment alloy and is made thick enough to compensate for the lower-moment alloy in the pedestal pole layer. The pedestal pole layer may be a bilayer of two different NiFe alloys with the upper layer in the bilayer having a higher moment, and the capping layer may be a CoFe alloy. The width of the pedestal pole layer is substantially reduced to reduce the pole tip area exposed. The reduced pole tip area and the increased use of lower-moment alloys enable a thinner protective film to be used to protect the pole tips from corrosion.

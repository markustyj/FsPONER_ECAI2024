A method of producing a thin film magnetic head comprises forming a thin film magnetic circuit including a magnetic film and a conductive coil film on a substrate, and heating the thin film magnetic circuit at a temperature in a range of from 270.degree.C. to 400.degree.C. before forming a protective layer covering the thin film magnetic circuit.

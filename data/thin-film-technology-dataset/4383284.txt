A perpendicular magnetic recording head is disclosed which includes a block core of a high magnetic permeability material having a side surface substantially perpendicular to a magnetic surface of a magnetic tape moving relative to it, a thin film core including a magnetic thin film of a high magnetic permeability material, the thin film core being secured to the side surface of the block core and having a width smaller than the width of the block core, the thin film core having a pole section extending from said side surface of the block core substantially perpendicularly to the magnetic surface and in contact therewith at the end, and an exciting coil wound on the block core and thin film core.

A camera using a film having a magnetic surface for recording magnetic data thereon. The camera includes a magnetic head for writing magnetic data onto the magnetic surface and for reading magnetic data recorded thereon. A pad movable with respect to the magnetic head is opposed to the magnetic head. The film is sandwiched between the pad and the magnetic head when magnetic data is written onto the magnetic surface of the film and the magnetic data recorded thereon is read. The pad is driven by a motor for driving a film feeding mechanism so that the pad moves away from the film feeding path when data writing and data reading is not carried out. A planetary gear mechanism connects the motor selectively to a pad driving mechanism and a film feeding mechanism.

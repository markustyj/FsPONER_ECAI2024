 A method of forming a reinforced slider body for use in a recording head having a transducer that is bi-directionally movable with respect to a surface of a magnetic medium. The method includes the steps of defining in a surface of a wafer a plurality of dice lanes having side walls to delineate a plurality of slider bodies on the wafer where the side walls having an angled configuration with respect to the wafer surface, polishing the dice lanes such that the interface between the wafer surface and the side walls is rounded, implanting a substance into the dice lanes; and applying a diamond-like carbon coating to the bottom surface and side walls of the dice lanes.

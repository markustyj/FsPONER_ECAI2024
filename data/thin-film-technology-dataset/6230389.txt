A method for forming a magnetoresistive (MR) lapping monitor, and a magnetoresistive (MR) lapping monitor formed employing the method. To practice the method, there is first provided a substrate. There is then formed over the substrate a patterned magnetoresistive (MR) layer, where the patterned magnetoresistive (MR) layer has a concavity at an edge of the patterned magnetoresistive (MR) layer opposite an air bearing surface (ABS) edge of the patterned magnetoresistive (MR) layer. There is then formed covering the edge of the patterned magnetoresistive (MR) layer opposite the air bearing surface edge of the patterned magnetoresistive (MR) layer and separated by the concavity a pair of patterned conductor lead layers, where neither patterned conductor lead layer within the pair of patterned conductor lead layers reaches a plane defined by the air bearing surface (ABS) edge of the patterned magnetoresistive (MR) layer. The method contemplates a magnetoresistive (MR) lapping monitor fabricated employing the method. The magnetoresistive (MR) lapping monitor contemplates a method for forming a magnetoresistive (MR) sensor element, with precise patterned magnetoresistive (MR) layer stripe height, while employing the magnetoresistive (MR) lapping monitor.

 A solar cell includes a substrate, a first electrode located over the substrate, where the first electrode comprises a first transition metal layer, at least one p-type semiconductor absorber layer located over the first electrode, an n-type semiconductor layer located over the p-type semiconductor absorber layer, and a second electrode located over the n-type semiconductor layer. The first transition metal layer contains (i) an alkali element or an alkali compound and (ii) a lattice distortion element or a lattice distortion compound. The p-type semiconductor absorber layer includes a copper indium selenide (CIS) based alloy material.

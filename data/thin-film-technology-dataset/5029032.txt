A magnetic head includes first and second cores joined into a one-piece member through a nonmagnetic spacer. A DGL head has a low saturation magnetic flux density thin film disposed between the first core and the nonmagnetic spacer. An EDG head further has a high saturation magnetic flux density thin film disposed between the second core and the nonmagnetic spacer in the DGL head structure. The low saturation magnetic flux density thin film is formed of an amorphous alloy preferably having a saturation magnetic flux density of 1,500 to 3,000 G.

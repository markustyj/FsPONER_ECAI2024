What is disclosed is a method of fabricating a thin film magnetic write transducer and the resulting write transducer structure. The method starts with the formation of a bottom pole of the write transducer on a base layer or substrate. This is followed by the formation of a write gap layer, formation of a coil, and formation a coil insulating layer. A thin top pole inner layer is then deposited over the entire structure. Next, a thick top pole outer layer is formed over the top pole inner layer. Preferably, the top pole outer layer is formed by plating through a photoresist mask that defines the top pole shape. Finally, the top pole inner layer is milled using the top pole outer layer as a mask. The top pole produced by this method has parallel sidewalls that are helpful in writing narrow data tracks. Use of the photoresist mask during plating of the top pole outer layer and ion milling of the top pole inner layer provides good dimensional control of the top pole's width. The two layer structure of the top pole allows the inner layer to be chosen for optimal write performance while the outer layer is chosen for fabrication considerations. In an alternative embodiment, the bottom pole is also fabricated in two layers that mirror the top pole layers.

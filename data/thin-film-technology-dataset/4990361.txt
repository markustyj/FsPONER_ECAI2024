A method and apparatus for producing a magnetic recording medium having an improved durability with a simple process. Nitrogen molecules and/or nitrogen atoms in an excited state are applied to a nonmagnetic substrate simultaneously with an iron vapor flow and an ion flow. The resulting magnetic recording medium has superior corrosion resistance and can be produced at a high film forming rate, and is especially suitable for high density recording because of its high coercive force.

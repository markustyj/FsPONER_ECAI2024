A thin-film magnetic head having an air bearing surface, includes a three-layer pole tip structure consisting of a lower pole tip element, a recording gap layer and an upper pole tip element, the structure having side surfaces, a rear surface and top surface, a lower auxiliary pole, a part of which contacts to the lower pole tip element, an upper auxiliary pole, a part of which contacts to the upper pole tip element, the upper auxiliary pole being magnetically connected at its rear portion with respect to the air bearing surface to the lower auxiliary pole so as to form a yoke together with the lower auxiliary pole, a lower insulating layer, surrounding the side surfaces and the rear surfaces of the three-layer pole tip structure, the lower insulating layer being located between the lower and upper auxiliary poles and having a top surface, a coil conductor formed on the top surface of the lower insulating layer, and an upper insulating layer covering the coil conductor, a part of the upper insulating layer being located between the lower insulating layer and the upper auxiliary pole. The top surface of the lower insulating layer is leveled lower than the top surface of the three-layer pole tip structure over at least a region within which the coil conductor is formed.

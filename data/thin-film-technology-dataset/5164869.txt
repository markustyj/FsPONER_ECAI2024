An integrated inductive write, magnetoresistive (MR) read thin film magnetic head comprising an open magnetic yoke having outside legs each having a winding thereon and a central leg having an opening across which the MR element is coupled. The outer legs are overlapped at one end to form confronting pole pieces having a transducing gap between the pole pieces, and the central leg is positioned between the pole pieces at one end and joined with the outer legs at the other end to form a symmetrical magnetic yoke structure. The windings are wound in a direction so that the flux produced by equally energizing the windings is equal and opposite in each of the outside legs, is additive at the transducing gap between the pole pieces, and produces no net flux through the central leg.

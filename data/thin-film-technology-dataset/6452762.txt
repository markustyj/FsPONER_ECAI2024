The present invention provides a magneto-resistive (MR) element comprising: a first magnetic layer 1 provided on a substrate; a non-magnetic layer 3 arranged to be in contact with the first magnetic layer; and a second magnetic layer 2 arranged to be in contact with the non-magnetic layer; wherein sense current flowing in the first and the second magnetic layer is changed by a resistance change according to an external magnetic field, and a sense current flowing distance in the first magnetic layer and/or a sense current flowing distance in the second magnetic layer is longer than a sense current flowing distance in a superimposed portion of the first magnetic layer, the non-magnetic layer, and the second magnetic layer.

When writing data on a recording medium, a thin film magnetic head must concentrate its magnetic fluxes to a tip end of a pole thereof. For this reason, ineffective leakage magnetic fluxes to be outputted in the writing must be reduced as much as possible by desirably varying construction or formation of the thin film magnetic head. These magnetic fluxes are passed and converged through a lower layer core which is formed within a recess formed within a substrate of the thin film magnetic head. Through several experiments and study, it is proved that an average inclination angle at a side wall slope of the recess must be ranged from 15 degrees to 75 degrees. In order to form such recess, portions other than a portion at which the recess is to be formed on the substrate are covered by a patterned resist; the substrate is heated and the resist is partially flown so that the average inclination angle at the side edge portion of patterned resist will become equal to or smaller than 70 degrees; the recess is formed by an ion beam etching; and then remained resist is removed from the substrate. Thus, a smooth slope can be obtained at the edge of recess, by which the magnetic fluxes can be smoothly converged at the tip end of pole so that the recording can be performed with high recording density.

A magnetoresistance effect type head comprises a magnetoresistance effect film having a pair of leads connected thereto and possessing a magnetic field responding part and a pair of upper and lower shield layers having a magnetoresistance effect type head satisfies the relations, W.sub.s &lt;W.sub.r and T.sub.r &lt;W.sub.r, wherein W.sub.s stands for the width of the surface of the upper shield layer facing the magnetoresistance effect film, W.sub.r for the distance between the pair of leads, and T.sub.r for the width of the magnetic field responding part of the magnetoresistance effect film. The magnetic field responding part of the magnetoresistance effect film is formed as of the remainder of the MR film region whose magnetic moment is fixed outside the end part of the upper shield layer facing the MA film. The magnetic field responding part is otherwise formed of a protruding part of the magnetoresistance effect film extended in the direction of the surface facing the medium. As a result, linear resolution suitable for a system having such high recording density as exceeds the order of Gb/inch.sup.2 of planar recording density is obtained. Further, a narrow track suitable for a system of high recording density can be produced accurately.

A process of forming a combination-type thin film magnetic head on a wafer is disclosed wherein plural polished amount-monitoring elements are formed at the same time as formation of the members which constitute the inductive-type thin film magnetic head. The plural polished amount-monitoring elements each have a different distance from the inside edge opposite to he air bearing surface of the joined surface between a pair of electrode members to the standard position of the zero-throat height. After the magneto-resistive-effective-type thin film magnetic head is formed, the wafer is cut into plural bars, each having plural arranged combination type thin film magnetic head units. Then ends of the bar are polished while monitoring the polished amount of the air bearing surface, by measuring the continuation and discontinuation between the electrode members of the polished amount-monitoring element formed on each bar, the ends of the bars are polished with monitoring the polished amounts of the air bearing surfaces to form plural combination type thin film magnetic head units having desired Throat Heights. Lastly, each bar is cut into plural combination type thin film magnetic head. The polish of the air bearing surface can be controlled in submicron order and thereby, the thin film magnetic head having a high surface recording density and little deterioration of reproducing output can be manufactured in a high yield process.

A thin film head apparatus and method for forming such a thin film head. In one approach, the present invention recites forming a cavity in a dielectric layer. Next, a layer of high magnetic field saturation (HBsat) material is sputter-deposited over the dielectric layer such that the HBsat material is deposited into the cavity formed in the dielectric layer. The cavity in the dielectric layer functions as a mold or "stencil" for the HBsat material. The HBsat material deposited into the cavity is used to form the first core of a thin film head. After the formation of the first core of the thin film head, a gap layer of material is deposited above the dielectric layer and above the first core. Next, a layer of HBsat material is sputter-deposited above the gap layer of material and above the first core of the thin film head. The layer of HBsat material disposed above the gap layer of material and above the first core is used to form the second core of the thin film head. Hence, this invention forms first and second cores of a thin film head using sputter deposition processes. As a result, selected HBsat materials which were not well suited to conventional thin film head formation methods can now be used to form the cores of thin film head structures.

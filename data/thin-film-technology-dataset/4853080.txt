A lift-off process for patterning bottom shields used in thin film magnetic recording heads. The lift-off process comprises the steps of depositing a first layer of resist material (22) on a substrate (20) and hard baking the resist material (22). A transfer layer (24) is deposited over the first layer of resist material (22) and a second layer of resist material (26) is deposited on top of the transfer layer (24). The second layer of resist material (24) is then patterned and developed. The patterned structure is then etched to form a mask structure wherein the transfer layer (24) overhangs the first layer of resist material (22). An adhesion layer (30) and an amorphous magnetic alloy material (32) are then sequentially deposited on the exposed surface of the substrate (20). The amorphous magnetic alloy material (32) is sputter deposited at a pressure of about 3.4 mT, a condition that resists the stress in the amorphous alloy material to less than 10.sup.9 dynes per square centimeter. Low stress is required to preserve the integrity of the mask structure. The mask layers and unwanted amorphous allow material (32) are removed using ultrasonic agitation in acetone. This process results in a shield pattern having tapered sidewalls which enhance the reliability of subsequently deposited conductor metallization.

After forming a bottom shield layer on a substrate, a GMR element embedded within a shield gap layer is formed, a first magnetic layer constituting a top shield as well as a bottom pole of an inductive type thin film magnetic head, and an inorganic insulating layer having a cut-out portion having a depth equal to a desired throat height at a pole portion. After forming a write gap layer on the first magnetic layer and inorganic insulating layer, a second magnetic layer is formed to have a pole portion within the cut-out portion of said inorganic insulating layer and a connecting portion extending above the inorganic insulating layer, a part of the write gap layer within the cut-out portion on the inorganic insulating layer is selectively removed by etching using the pole portion as a mask, and further the first magnetic layer is removed over a part of its thickness to form the trim structure. Furthermore, after forming a thin film coil on the write gap layer situating above the inorganic insulating layer, a third magnetic layer is formed such that the third magnetic layer is brought into contact not only with a surface of the pole portion of the second magnetic layer but also with side walls of the pole portion. The thin film magnetic head has a narrow pole chip defining a track width, although the throat height is small, saturation and leakage of a magnetic flux can be suppressed, thin film magnetic head having a high recording efficiency can be manufactured with a high yield.

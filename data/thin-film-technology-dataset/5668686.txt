A thin film magnetic head made of material having the magneto-resistance (MR) effect and its manufacturing method are provided. A lower shield layer for magnetically shielding an MR film is formed with a trench of a gull-wing shape having a flat bottom surface and opposite slanted surfaces formed on both sides of the bottom surface. The MR film is formed on the lower shield layer conformal to the gull-wing shape. The region of the MR film on the flat bottom surface forms an effective magnetic active region. A track center shift and the generation of a side-lobe in the off-track characteristic specific to an MR head can be suppressed and high density recording and reproducing of narrow tracks are possible.

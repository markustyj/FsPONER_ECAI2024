A thin film two-pole inductive magnetic head for a computer disk drive assembly. The head comprises a substrate, a first pole formed over the substrate, a gap layer formed over the first pole and a second pole formed over the gap layer. The first and second poles have their distal ends coupled together in a yoke region, while their proximal ends terminate at their tips in an air bearing surface. A leading surface of the first pole extends back toward the yoke region at an acute angle to the air bearing surface. The head reduces the amplitude and high frequency content of secondary pulses in a readback waveform so as to ease the task of electronically isolating the main pulses for downstream processing of the read data.

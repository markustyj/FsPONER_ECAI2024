A lapping guide is provided to determine the position at which lapping of a thin film head to define pole faces should be terminated. Accurate positioning of the lapping guide with respect to the head is insured by forming various elements of the lapping guide during the same photolithographic process steps as those used to form elements of the head. The lapping guide may be used either as an electrical or optical guide. When used as an optical guide, a second lapping guide may be provided as an indicator that more frequent inspection is necessary.

A compound thin film magnetic head in which the upper shield of the readout MR head also serves as the lower magnetic film of the write inductive head. The upper shield has a layered structure including a shield part of soft magnetic material functioning as a shield to magnetically shield the MR head, a lower pole part and transition part of soft magnetic material functioning as a write magnetic pole opposing the upper pole of the inductive head, and a nonmagnetic separation layer to magnetically separate these. Between the lower pole part and the transition part, an additional nonmagnetic separation layer can be provided. The shield part can be configured from multiple magnetic films formed in layers and enclosing a nonmagnetic separation layer.

A magnetic thin film head of the planar geometry type has a dielectric member located between facing ends of pole members in the gap region. The thickness of at least one of the pole members in the gap region is reduced by the dielectric member relative to the thickness of the remainder of the pole members. This dielectric member in the region of reduced thickness functions to increase the density of the magnetic flux in that region during recording, thereby improving the write capability of the head.

 The present invention uses Electronic Lapping Guides (ELG's), which are patterned on every tape head, as servo format verifiers. This is implemented by specifically placing the ELG's at the appropriate locations to match the servo signal track locations and thus be usable to verify the servo format patterns on the formatted tape. According to another aspect of the present invention, tape head components which have faulty read sensors, servo sensors, or write elements which have valid ELG's may be used for the servo format verification purpose.

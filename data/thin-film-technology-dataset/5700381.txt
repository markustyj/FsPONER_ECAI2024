After applying a metal film on a surface of a substrate, the metal film is patterned in such a manner that the surface of the substrate is exposed in a pattern that corresponds to the pattern of the required indented portion. Then, the substrate is immersed in an etchant which etches the substrate selectively to form the indented portion in the surface of the substrate using the metal film as a mask.The method makes it possible to define the depth and the pattern of an indented portion where a magnetic transducer is provided with a high degree of accuracy, to prevent a reduction in pattern accuracy due to re-adhering and to advance industrial productivity.

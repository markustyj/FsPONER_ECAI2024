A magnetoresistive device for recording data includes a first pole connected to a second pole that is above the first pole. Above the first pole is a first conductive coil imbedded in a first insulation material, with at least a portion of the first conductive layer disposed below all of the second pole. The first and second poles have a first and second pole tip portion, respectively, between which is defined a write gap. A first pole pedestal, connected to the first pole at the first pole tip portion, and a second pole pedestal, connected to the second pole at the second pole tip portion, can be located between the first and second poles. Also, additional conductive coils can be included above the first conductive coil.

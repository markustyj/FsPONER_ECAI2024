A transducer in a magnetic storage device includes an elongated magnetoresistive element having an active region. First and second electrical contacts couple to the elongated magnetoresistive element on opposite sides of the active region. A bottom inductive write pole and shared shield is positioned adjacent the elongated magnetoresistive element and includes a body region and a pole tip region proximate the active region. The shared shield includes a notch defined between the pole tip region and the body region to thereby improve magnetic stability in the pole tip region. A top inductive write pole is spaced apart from the bottom inductive write pole and shared shield to form a magnetic gap with the pole tip region for inductively writing information.

A thin film head array has at least two stacks, each stack having a selected number of recording heads. The two stacks are joined such that the gaps in the heads of the first stack are interleaved with respect to the gaps in the heads of the second stack, and when such an array is used for recording and reproducing data on a magnetic medium, a plurality of recording tracks are provided. In a second embodiment, two assemblies, each having a plurality of stacks according to the first embodiment, are joined in a V-shape. Each gap in the heads of each stack occupies separate tracks on the recording medium and each recording gap has a magnetizing orientation that is 3.degree.-15.degree. with respect to that of the adjacent heads.

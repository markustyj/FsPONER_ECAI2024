A thin film magnetic head in which the width of the first and second magnetic yoke layers between the zero throat point and the yoke flare point is progressively widened to equalize the flux density over this length so that the whole length reaches saturation simultaneously at a single current. Consequently, the field at the gap at the air bearing surface increases insignificantly once saturation of this length occurs, and the write field is then constant for currents above the saturation value.

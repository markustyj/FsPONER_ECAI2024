A thin film magnetic transducer having a pair of planar core pieces with front and rear legs and a coil formed around the rear legs. The coil is preferably formed by deposition where turns of the coil have a bottom pieces, riser portions and top pieces which are interconnected to form the coil. In the preferred embodiment, the transducer track width is terminated by means of termination portions which extend into the transducer gap. These portions are preferably defined to create a more uniform flux density at the edges of the track width. In addition, the flux density across the track width is preferably made more uniform by including a curve portion along the rear edge of the front legs. This curve portion may also follow an exponential formula to achieve this uniform density.

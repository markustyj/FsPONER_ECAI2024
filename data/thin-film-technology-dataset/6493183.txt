A thermally-assisted magnetic recording disk drive records data by heating a small region of the magnetic layer on the disk to near or above its Curie temperature while a write field is applied by a thin film inductive write head. The thin film inductive write head includes an electrically resistive heater located in the write gap between the pole tips of the write head. The resistive heater is sandwiched between first and second spacer layers that are located between the pole tips of the write head. In a current-perpendicular-to-the plane (CPP) embodiment, the spacer layers are electrically conductive and the pole tips serve as the electrical leads to provide electrical current in a direction generally perpendicular to the layer of resistive heater material. In a current-in-the plane (CIP) embodiment, the spacer layers are formed of insulating material and electrical leads are formed as portions of a film between the spacer layers and in contact with each side of the resistive heater. The width of the resistive heater is less than the width of the pole tips. Thus since only the region of the magnetic layer on the disk that is heated by the resistive heater can be written by the pole tips of the write head, the data track width on the disk is defined by the width of the resistive heater, not by the geometry of write head pole tips.

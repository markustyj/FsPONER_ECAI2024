A thin-film magnetic head and a method of manufacturing the same of the invention achieve reductions in a track width of a recording head and in a yoke length. In the thin-film magnetic head of the invention, a bottom pole layer and a top pole layer include: first portions located in a region including a region that faces a thin-film coil; second portions forming a pole portion and connected to the first portions; and third portions for connecting the first portions to each other. The thin-film coil is placed between the second portion and the third portion of each of the pole layers. Each of outermost and innermost ends of the coil is adjacent to each of a sidewall of the second portion and a sidewall of the third portion, respectively, while an insulating film formed on the sidewall of the second portion is placed between the outermost end of the coil and the sidewall of the second portion, and the insulating film formed on the sidewall of the third portion is placed between the innermost end of the coil and the sidewall of the third portion.

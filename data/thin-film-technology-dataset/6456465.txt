A method and system for providing a magnetoresistive head that reads data from a recording media is disclosed. The method and system include providing a first shield, a second shield, a magnetoresistive sensor, and a lead. The first shield has a first end, a central portion and a second end. The first end is closer to the recording media during use than the second end. The second shield has a first end, a central portion, and a second end. The first end of the second shield is separated from the first end of the first shield by a read gap. The central portion of the second shield is separated from the central portion of the first shield by a distance that is greater than the read gap. The magnetoresistive sensor is disposed between the first shield and the second shield and has a front end and a back end. The front end of the magnetoresistive sensor is electrically coupled with the first end of the first shield or the first end of the second shield. The lead is electrically coupled with the back end of the magnetoresistive sensor. Thus, current is driven through the magnetoresistive sensor in a direction substantially perpendicular to the recording media during use.

There is provided a head slider for reducing a sticking force or stiction between the head slider and a disk in a disk drive unit in which a difference in level between an air bearing and a head portion is small when the disk rotates in a reverse direction. Air bearing portions having flat top surfaces are formed in parallel with each other on both sides of a side of a slider which flies above the disk at an air outflow end of the slider. A head portion comprising head elements and a protection film for protecting the head elements is provided at an air outflow end of one of the air bearing portions, while a dummy head portion comprising only a protection film is provided at an air outflow end of the other air bearing portion. Top surfaces of the head portion and the dummy head portion are formed lower by a step than top surfaces of the air bearing portions. The top surfaces of the head portion and the dummy head portion on the air outflow ends are formed lower than the top surfaces thereof adjacent to the air bearing portions, whereby the contact resistance between the head slider and the disk resulting when the disk rotates in the reverse direction is reduced.

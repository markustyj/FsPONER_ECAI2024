 Provided are a thin film magnetic head capable of inhibiting an excessive temperature rise while reducing its size in accordance with a higher recording density, and obtaining a higher read output, a method of manufacturing the same, and a magnetic disk drive using the thin film magnetic head. A heat dissipation layer for transferring heat generated in a magnetic transducer film to outside is disposed adjacent to the magnetic transducer film on a side, the side being opposite to a side facing a recording medium. In a gap layer for electrically insulating between the magnetic transducer film and a pair of shield layers, a portion of the gap layer in contact with an end surface of the magnetic transducer film on a side, the side being opposite to a side facing the recording medium is formed so as to have a thin thickness ranging from 2 nm to 30 nm inclusive. Thereby, the heat generated in the magnetic transducer film can be more effectively dissipated than previously possible, and a temperature rise can be inhibited. Therefore, an increase in electrical resistance can be inhibited, and a higher read output can be obtained.

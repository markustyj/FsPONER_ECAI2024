 A magnetic head provided with magnetoresistance effect element, the magnetic head comprises first shielding layer superimposed on one surface of the magnetoresistance effect element and whose area is larger than that of this one surface, a first lead layer formed ranging from a portion where the first shielding layer is superimposed on the magnetoresistance effect element to another portion on the first shielding layer and which applies the sense current to the magnetoresistance effect element, a second shielding layer superimposed on another surface of the magnetoresistance effect element opposite to the one surface and whose area is larger than that of the other surface, and a second lead layer formed ranging from a portion where the second shielding layer is superimposed on the magnetoresistance effect element to another portion on the second shielding layer and which applies the sense current to the magnetoresistance effect element.

 A manufacturing method of a thin-film head includes the steps of, laminating and patterning a soft magnetic layer with iron alloy that contains silicon and aluminum through a base layer on a substrate; laminating an insulating layer on the patterned soft magnetic layer; performing a chemical-mechanical polishing of a surface of the laminated insulating layer and the patterned soft magnetic layer with a first acid slurry; forming a lower shield layer by a mechanical polishing with a second weak acid, or neutral slurry with a pH different from that of the first slurry; and forming a lower shield gap layer and a magnetoresistive effect layer on the lower shield layer.

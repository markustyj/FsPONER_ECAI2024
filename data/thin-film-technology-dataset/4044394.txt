A narrow track width magnetic head can be formed using an integrated circuit formation techniques such as evaporation plating, chemical etching, etc. But, there has been such a problem that it is difficult to provide a center tap in a conventional thin film magnetic head structure including coils of four or more turns. A magnetic head according to the present invention comprising a coil divided into two sections by the center tap, the electrostatic capacitance of each section being substantially the same. The coil may be formed into a precise pattern with ease by photoetching technique. A plurality of sets of conductive films insulated from one another are provided crossing a magnetic core, each set consisting of two conductive films of the same pattern. The alternating layers of the conductive films are connected on the backward of a magnetic gap to provide the two sections of the coil. A center tap is derived from a connection portion of the two sections of the coil and a coil terminal is provided at each of the opposite free ends of the coil. Thus, the thin film magnetic head having a multi-turn coil with a center tap is provided.

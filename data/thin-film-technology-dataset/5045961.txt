A thin film magnetic head including a first magnetic material layer, a gap material layer formed on the first magnetic material layer, an inorganic insulating layer having a generally trapezoidal shape in cross section and formed on the gap material layer, a second magnetic material layer formed on the organic insulating layer and conductor coils formed on the gap material layer within the organic insulating layer, in which the gap material layer is tapered by an etching process with the organic insulating layer of the generally trapezoidal shape in cross section used as a mask, and thereafter the organic insulating layer is etched so that the organic insulating layer is caused to stand back from the gap material layer a predetermined distance in the direction away from the air bearing surface of the head which is opposed to a recording medium.

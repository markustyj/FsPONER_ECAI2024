A magnetic transduction device for reading and/or writing of data contained on a magnetic support such as a disc or magnetic tape comprises a magnetic circuit formed by two thin superposed magnetic layers magnetically coupled at one end and forming an air gap at the other end, and a coil between said thin magnetic layers formed by thin conductive layers separated by thin insulating layers. At least one of the thin conducting layers comprises at least one magnetoresistance.

A magnetoresistive head having separate write and read gaps including a leading write pole, a trailing write/shield pole, and a following shield pole, wherein an elongated magnetoresistive sensor strip having a central sense region is mounted in the read gap, and further wherein the leading write pole has a length corresponding to the central sense region of the sensor and defines a track width, and the trailing/shield pole and following shield are the same length as the overall length of the magnetoresistive sensor strip.

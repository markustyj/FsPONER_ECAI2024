Optically or visually perceptible lapping and grinding patterns are provided in a thin film transducer structure by depositing conductive material both between the magnetic pole pieces and, external to such pole pieces. The conductive material between the pole pieces is so positioned as to determine the zero throat point of the transducer and is in predetermined aligned relationship with the external pattern by, for example, being formed during a single masking step.

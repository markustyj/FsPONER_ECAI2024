An MR head includes an MR film electrically connected to two lead layers that are asymmetric with respect to at least one of thickness and resistance. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the MR head includes a write pole that extends over a thinner lead layer and that terminates over the MR film so that the write pole does not extend over a thicker lead layer. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a thinner lead layer is connected to a single-ended preamplification circuit, and a thicker lead layer is connected to a ground or reference voltage.

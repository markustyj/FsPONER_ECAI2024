The present invention relates to a magneto-resistive tunnel junction read head having a multi-layer tunnel junction composed of a tunnel barrier layer sandwiched between a ferromagnetic free layer and a ferromagnetic pinned layer. Contiguous with the free layer is a hybrid, low-magnetization, T-shaped flux guide having a rear flux guide portion and a more narrow front flux guide portion. The front flux guide portion constitutes a part of an ABS (Air Bearing Surface). The rear portion entirely covers and overlaps the tunnel junction. The hybrid flux guide has a lower magnetization -than the sensing layer due to the addition of magnetization reducing elements such as Ta or Nb. Using this design, a tunnel junction read head has improved read performance and achieves a high and stable head output for adaptation to ultrahigh density recording.

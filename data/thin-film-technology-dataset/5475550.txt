A magnetoresistive transducer design for cross-talk supression and increased Neel temperature is disclosed. The transducer is formed by fabricating on a suitable substrate an antiferromagnetic material layer above and below the permalloy layer. The additional antiferromagnetic layer between the substrate and the permalloy increases the exchange coupling biasing of the magnetoresistive transducer thereby providing increased cross-talk supression and greater longitudinal bias. The location of the additional antiferromagnetic layer beneath the permalloy also increases the Neel temperature of the transducer. A permanent magnetic material can also be substituted for the antiferromagnetic material with the result that the longitudinal bias is increased by coupling to the upper and lower surfaces of the permalloy layer thereby doubling the effect.

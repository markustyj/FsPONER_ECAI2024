A thin film magnetic head includes a projecting portion formed on a surface opposite to a magnetic gap layer of at least one of pole portions of upper and lower magnetic layers. The projecting portion extends inwardly from the foremost exposed end surface of the pole portion and has a shape such that the edge of the foremost exposed end surface opposite to the magnetic gap layer of the pole portion is offset from a line normal to the direction of relative movement of the magnetic head with respect to a magnetic medium. The edge is thereby provided with a certain width in the direction of the relative movement with respect to the magnetizing inverting portion, so that the entire edge does not pass over the magnetizing inverting portion all at once but passes over it one portion of the edge after another. An undershoot occurring in a reproduced signal is thereby flattened with a reduced peak portion and reproduction characteristics are therefore improved and occurrence of a reading error can be prevented. In one aspect of the invention, a reduced thickness portion is formed in at least one of the upper and lower magnetic layers in the vicinity of a throat height zero position. Magnetic saturation occurs in only the reduced thickness portion and a proper magnetic saturation in the pole can thereby be achieved.

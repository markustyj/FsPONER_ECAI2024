It is an object of the invention to improve characteristics of a thin-film magnetic head in the case where the frequency of data to write is high, in particular. In a thin-film magnetic head of the invention a nonmagnetic conductive member is provided to face at least part of a top pole layer of an induction-type magnetic transducer. Consequently, eddy currents are induced inside the nonmagnetic conductive member by a write current. The eddy currents suppress a magnetic field leaking from magnetic layers. In addition, the nonmagnetic conductive member is in contact with the top pole layer. Therefore, eddy currents generated inside the top pole layer are fed to the nonmagnetic conductive member, too. As a result, it is possible to prevent reductions in characteristics such as: a reduction in intensity of a write magnetic field due to eddy currents; an increase in delay between a write current and generation of a write magnetic field; and a decrease in gradient of rise of a write magnetic field with respect to time.

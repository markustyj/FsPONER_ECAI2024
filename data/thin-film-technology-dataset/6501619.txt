A thin film magnetic read/write head which has a return pole and a read/write pole adjacent to the return pole. The return pole has a vertical sidewall which has a predetermined height and is perpendicular to a substrate. An insulating layer is disposed on the sidewall between the return pole and read/write pole. The insulating layer thus defines a gap spacing between the return pole and read/write pole. The read/write pole comprises a magnetic material layer which is perpendicular to the substrate and adhered to the insulating layer. The thickness of the magnetic material layer determines the thickness of the read/write pole. The return pole and read/write pole have top surfaces which are coplanar. The plane defined by the top return pole surface is perpendicular to the magnetic material layer and parallel to the substrate. The read/write pole is magnetically coupled to a core layer which is magnetically coupled to a solenoidal winding of conductive material. The core layer is coupled to a base layer which is coupled to the return pole. The return pole and core layer are disposed on top of the base layer.

A magnetoresistive (MR) device includes a sensor that has a first surface electrically coupled to a first lead structure, and a second surface electrically coupled to a second lead structure. The first lead structure and second lead structure each include an insulation layer with an aperture that is aligned with the sensor. Conductive materials, disposed within the apertures, are electrically coupled to said first and second surfaces of the sensor, respectively, thereby restricting the current flow of an applied current as it passes through the sensor. The first lead structure can further include a shield and a sense lead, each of which are electrically coupled with the conductive material disposed within the first aperture, while the second lead structure can further include a shield and sense lead which are electrically couple with said conductive material disposed with the second aperture. Also, the conductive material can form part of the shield or sense lead.

 In one aspect described herein, a read head having one or more magnetoresistive (MR) sensors (or devices) is provided. In one example, the read head includes an MR sensor and an insulator layer disposed at the same level as the MR sensor. The read head further includes a bearing surface, wherein the insulator layer forms a portion of the bearing surface and is disposed between a surface of the MR sensor and the bearing surface to provide protection for the MR sensor from exposure to the bearing surface. The MR sensor may include a stack of thin-film layers to form an AMR, GMR, or TGMR sensor element. The stack may further include a slanted surface portion, wherein the insulator layer is disposed on the slanted surface portion, thereby recessing the MR sensor from the bearing surface.

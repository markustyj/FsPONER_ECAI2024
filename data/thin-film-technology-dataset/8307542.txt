 A method of assembling a recording head includes attaching a first segment having a plurality of toroidal coils to a second segment having a plurality of flexure beams to form a wafer assembly. The method also includes attaching the wafer assembly to a slider body such that a cavity portion of the second segment cooperates with a cavity portion in the slider body to form a transducer cavity. The method also includes vacuum attaching the slider body to a reference flat surface. The method also includes positioning a transducer body having a transducer in the transducer cavity using a touch sensor.

A CPP geometry spin valve sensor for sensing magnetically recorded information on a data storage medium includes an electrically conductive, multilevel seed layer that interfacially engages a pinning layer of the sensor and increases the sensor's magnetoresistance while maintaining acceptable values of free layer coercivity, pinned-free layer magnetic coupling and free layer magnetostriction.

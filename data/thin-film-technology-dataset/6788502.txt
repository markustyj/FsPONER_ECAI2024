A magnetic tunnel junction sensor is provided having a laminated free layer comprising a first sublayer formed of Co--Fe in contact with a spacer layer and a second sublayer formed of Ni--Fe--Mo. The Ni--Fe--Mo material of the second sublayer has a magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant, k, that is much smaller than that of Ni--Fe. Due to the small value of k of the Ni--Fe--Mo material used to fabricate the second sublayer of the free layer, the thickness of the Co--Fe first sublayer may be increased to improve manufacturability while retaining a low net stiffness of the free layer for high sensitivity of the MTJ sensor in response to signal fields from data magnetically recorded on a disk. The thicker Co--Fe first sublayer results in a higher magnetoresistance coefficient of the improved MTJ sensor.

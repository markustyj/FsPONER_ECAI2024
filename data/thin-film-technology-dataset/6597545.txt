A magnetic sensor includes a magnetoresistive sensor element and electrical contacts coupled to the magnetoresistive element configured to sense a response of the magnetoresistive element to a magnetic field. A magnetic shield is positioned adjacent the magnetoresistive element and configured to shield the magnetoresistive element from stray magnetic fields. The shield has a substantially stable magnetic domain pattern. A shield flux thief is positioned generally in a plane of the shield and spaced apart from the shield by a gap.

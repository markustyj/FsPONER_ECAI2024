A process for producing a vertical magnetic head for reading information from a magnetic media. The head includes a substrate on which is mounted an amagnetic spacer extending perpendicular to the face of the substrate. A first magnetic material is deposited in vapor phase thin film formed on either side of the spacer. A second magnetic material is deposited on the first by electrolytic growth.

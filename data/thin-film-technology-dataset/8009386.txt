 A magnetic tape head has a base substrate, a magnetic head layer formed on the base substrate, and a closure piece formed on the magnetic head layer. The distance from a first plane comprising a point on the tape bearing surface of the base substrate to a third plane comprising a point on the tape bearing surface of the closure piece is equal to or greater than the distance from the first plane to a second plane comprising a point on the tape bearing surface of the magnetic head layer.

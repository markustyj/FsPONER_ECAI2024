A thin film type magnetic head, in which a conductor is accommodated within a groove formed in part of a ferromagnetic substrate constituting part of a magnetic core, and a ferromagnetic film is disposed on the conductor to constitute part of the magnetic core. With this structure, it is possible to reduce the number of steps of layers constituting the magnetic head for reducing damage or breakage of the stepped portions of the layers and also increase the core gap in a central part of the core so as to reduce leakage flux even in the thin film magnetic head as well as bettering dissipation of Joule heat produced in the conductor.

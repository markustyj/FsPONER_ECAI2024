A thin film magnetic head includes a slider and thin film magnetic transducers, the slider supporting the thin film magnetic transducers. At least one of these thin film magnetic transducers is a magnetoresistive read element. The surface resistivity .rho. of the magnetic film of the magnetic disk is within the range of .rho..gtoreq.0.03.OMEGA..multidot.cm. Electric leak from the thin film magnetic head to the magnetic disk and electric discharge between these two are prevented.

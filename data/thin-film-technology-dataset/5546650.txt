A method of manufacturing a thin-film magnetic head having a write element capable of producing a magnetic flux density sufficient to write the high coercivity magnetic tapes at high track density. The manufacturing process requires a minimum number of lithographic steps, thereby increasing the yield of the multiple track magnetic head module. A trench is cut into the ferrite substrate material and filled with an insulator to produce a more efficient write element. A recess is then formed in the ferrite substrate having a geometry sufficient to hold a deposited thin-film conductive coil below the surface of the ferrite substrate. An insulator is then deposited on the ferrite substrate to form a gap spacer as well as to insulate the conductive thin-film coils from the ferrite substrate. The conductive thin-film coil is then deposited on the ferrite substrate in the recesses. A high-saturation flux density magnetic material is deposited on a planar nonmagnetic closure section and formed into separate magnetic pole pieces for each individual track. The magnetic pole pieces are then insulated from each other to produce a closure section having a planar surface matable with the ferrite substrate. The closure section is attached to the substrate by aligning the metal pole piece on the closure section is attached to the substrate by aligning the metal pole piece on the closure section. The magnetic pole piece is positioned in the front gap and has a width which defines the track width on the magnetic tape. The magnetic pole piece is also positioned to substantially cover the back gap region to increase the flux density existing at the front gap region.

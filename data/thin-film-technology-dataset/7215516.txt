 A magnetoresistive head includes a first magnetic shield, a first insulating film, a magnetoresistive film, a second insulating film and a second magnetic shield arranged in a track direction. The magnetoresistive film includes a magnetization free layer adjacent to an air-bearing surface, a magnetization pinned layer spaced apart from the magnetization free layer in a head height direction as viewed from the air-bearing surface, and a nonmagnetic intermediate layer connecting the magnetization free layer and the magnetization pinned layer, a magnetization direction of the magnetization free layer being rotatable in an external magnetic field and a magnetization direction of the magnetization pinned layer being substantially pinned under the external magnetic field.

A thin film magnetic read/write head is manufactured using a multi-layered sacrificial mask in a pole tip alignment process. The sacrificial mask includes a layer of metal deposited upon the magnetic upper pole tip. Subsequent sacrificial mask layers include nickel-iron alloy or photoresist. Following an ion milling alignment process, residual sacrificial mask layers are removed using a process in which the medal layer is selectively chemically etched away from the thin film magnetic head.

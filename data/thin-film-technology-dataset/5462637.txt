A process for the fabrication of thin film magnetic heads from a wafer is disclosed that provides improved stud adhesion, reduced risk of contamination, and elimination of corrosive elements along the magnetic pole tips. The process includes the steps of forming a first pole tip, forming simultaneously a second pole tip, lead straps and a layer at each stud location from plated pole tip material; applying a thin overcoat layer to the wafer; applying a first mask with an opening over each stud; removing the overcoat material in each opening with a noncorrosive etchant to expose the stud layer; removing the mask; applying a NiFe seed layer to the wafer; applying a second mask to the wafer having an opening over each stud slightly larger than that of the first mask; plating gold into each opening; and removing the second mask and the remaining seed layer.

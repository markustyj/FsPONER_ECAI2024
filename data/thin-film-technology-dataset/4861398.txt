DC bias currents are applied to a conducting wire of a thin film magnetic head to be inspected. When the DC bias currents (I.sub.0, I.sub.1, I.sub.2) are supplied to the conducting wire, the impedances (Z.sub.0, Z.sub.1, Z.sub.2) corresponding to the DC bias currents are measured. When a ratio (.vertline.Z.sub.1 -Z.sub.0 .vertline./.vertline.Z.sub.2 -Z.sub.0 .vertline.) corresponding to an overwrite characteristic (OW) reaches to a predetermined value by lapping tip portions of an upper magnetic layer and a lower magnetic layer of the magnetic head, the lapping process of the magnetic head is finished.

A magnetic sensor utilizing a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect, wherein an insulation layer with a contact hole is formed on a lower terminal layer, a GMR layer is formed thereover on the region including the entire contact hole and at least the surrounding insulation layer, and an upper terminal layer is formed thereover. The sensor offers several advantages in that it is easy to manufacture and is compact, and has a high degree of resistance change.

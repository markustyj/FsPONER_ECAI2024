 Embodiments of the present invention provide a grounded conductive layer between the heater and the lower magnetoresistive (MR) shield in the read/write head structure. The grounded conductive layer eliminates or at least substantially prevents the accumulation of charges on the lower MR shield as a result of the voltage supplied to the heater. In one embodiment, a magnetic head comprises a plurality of read/write components; a heater disposed near the plurality of read/write components; and a grounded conductive layer disposed between the heater and the plurality of read/write components.

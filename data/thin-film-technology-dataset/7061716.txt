 A thin-film magnetic head includes a bottom pole layer, a top pole layer, a recording gap layer, and a thin-film coil. The bottom pole layer has first to fifth layers. The third layer and the fifth layer constitute a coupling portion for establishing magnetic coupling between the bottom pole layer and the top pole layer. The thin-film coil has first to fifth layer portions each of which is made of a flat conductive layer of a single turn. The first to fifth layer portions are laminated, and connected in series to each other. The coupling portion has an end face facing toward the air bearing surface. The end face includes a curved surface convex toward the medium facing surface.

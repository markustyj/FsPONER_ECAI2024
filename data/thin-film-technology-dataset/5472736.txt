A method of manufacturing a thin film magnetic transducer in which a layer of photoresist material is used to pattern the turns of a bi-level electrical coil. The thickness of the photoresist layer is increased to the maximum height of the bi-level coil. A multi-turn spiral type rectangular trench is formed to define the pattern of the coil structure. In the first coil plating step, a first coil section is plated in the trench to approximately the midpoint of its height. The layer of the resist material is then cured and a blocking mask is deposited over the portion of the first coil section that is not to be further increased in height. The area of the coil that is not blocked by the blocking mask is again plated using the initial pattern until each partial turn in the unblocked section reaches the top of the groove. The cured resist material and the blocking mask are then removed. Since both plating steps rely on the same pattern that has been formed in the photoresist material, alignment errors and mask tolerance problems experienced with prior art methods are virtually eliminated, thereby resulting in substantially higher yields and lower manufacturing costs.

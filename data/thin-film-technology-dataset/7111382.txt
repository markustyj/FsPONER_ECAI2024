 Methods are provided for forming current perpendicular to the plane thin film read heads. In one embodiment, the method comprises the steps of forming a lower sensor lead, forming a lower sensor lead cladding of a low sputter yield material on the lower sensor lead, forming a sensor element on the lower sensor lead cladding, and forming an upper sensor lead coupled to the sensor element. The low sputter yield material helps to reduce redeposition of the lower sensor lead material onto side walls of the sensor element as the sensor element is being formed.

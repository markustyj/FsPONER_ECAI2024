 A method of manufacturing for providing closer head-to-media spacing, and the resulting disk, includes evenly lubricating a magnetic media disk, increasing the viscosity of a selected non-data zone region of the disk, and removing at least a portion of the lower viscosity region of the lubrication layer in a data zone region of the disk, thereby decreasing the thickness of the lubrication layer in the data zone portion of the lower viscosity region, producing a magnetic media disk capable of closer head-to-media spacing in the data zone portion of the lower viscosity region of the lubrication layer than in the non-data zone portion.

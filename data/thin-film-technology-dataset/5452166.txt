An improved thin film magnetic recording head includes a pole tip assembly which has a precisely formed physical geometry. The physical geometry of the pole tip assembly minimizes deleterious effects due to undershoots, while the method of manufacturing the pole tip assembly allows for precise control of feature tolerances (up to 0.2 micrometer accuracy) of the pole tip assembly. In one embodiment, the pole tip assembly has a generally hexagonal configuration with a raised hexagonal center portion comprising leading and trailing pole tips and a raised gap portion, and a surrounding hexagonal trench which surrounds the raised center portion. The raised center portion is substantially flush with the surrounding face of the recording head. Alternative embodiments contemplate elliptical or circular raised center portions, and variously shaped trenches to facilitate the evacuation of debris. The method of manufacturing the improved recording head includes the steps of lapping the face of the head to form an air bearing surface, and ion milling the face of the head to form the desired features (i.e., the desired pole tip configuration). The ion milling is typically done to a depth of less than 2 micrometers which allows precise control of the feature tolerances.

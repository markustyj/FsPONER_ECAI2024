A magnetoresistive (MR) read transducer having passive end regions separated by a central active region in which an MR layer is formed which extends over substantially only the central active region and in which a hard magnetic layer is formed in each end region. The hard magnetic layers form an abutting junction having electrical and magnetic continuity with the MR layer to produce a longitudinal bias in the MR sensor. The transducer is produced by a method in which the same stencil defines the extent of both the MR layer and the hard magnetic layers so that the abutting junctions are formed easily and reliably.

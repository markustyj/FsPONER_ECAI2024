A thin film magnetic head has first and second magnetic pole layers and, a thin film coil, a magnetic gap layer, and a magnetically insulating layer. The magnetically insulating layer is disposed along a plane facing a recording medium, and divides at least one of the front end section of the first magnetic pole layer and the frond end section of the second magnetic pole layer into a plurality of sub-sections. An additional magnetic pole layer may be provided on at least one of the front end section of the first magnetic pole layer and the front end section of the second magnetic pole layer with a magnetically insulating layer being interposed therebetween. The thin film magnetic head thus fabricated enables the reduction of undershoots to appear at both sides of a main peak of the waveform a signal reproduced by the magnetic head.

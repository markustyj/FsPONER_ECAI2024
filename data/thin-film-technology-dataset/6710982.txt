A read/write head includes a bottom shield and a shared shield. The shared shield includes a first domain and a plurality of closure domains. The read/write head also includes a magnetoresistive sensor deposited adjacent an air bearing surface between the bottom shield and the shared shield. The magnetoresistive sensor includes a magnetoresistor aligned with the first domain. Non-magnetic material separates the magnetoresistive sensor from the bottom shield and the shared shield. The shared shield includes a shaped feature that defines an unambiguous direction of magnetization for the first domain.

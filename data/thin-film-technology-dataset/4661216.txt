A bath for electroplating a high cobalt magnetic alloy material suitable for fabrication of thin film heads. The ternary cobalt-nickel-iron (CoNiFe) alloy electroplating bath composition produces a high cobalt magnetic thin film having high saturation magnetization, a magnetostriction coefficient that is substantially zero, and low coercivity. A process suitable for deposition of the soft magnetic material provides a thin film head where 4.pi.Ms is higher than 14K gauss, Hc is less than 20e, 1-10 MHZ permeability is near 1000, and has a near zero magnetostriction.

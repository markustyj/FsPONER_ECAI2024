A dual element electrical lapping guide system is disclosed for a row of multi-layer dual element magnetoresistive and inductive magnetic transducers formed on a substrate, which will be used to form sliders, the sliders being separated by separation kerfs, and the multi-layer transducers aligned along an edge of the substrate for lapping of the edge. The dual element lapping guide system comprises superposed resistive elements and electrical switch elements, each positioned in one of the separation kerfs, and having an edge thereof positioned so as to be aligned with the edge of the row and subject to lapping of the row. Each electrical switch element comprises a bottom and a top layer connected at one end thereof and separated at the other end thereof by an insulation layer, so as to be initially closed at the connected end, which end is aligned with the edge of the multi-layer transducers and subject to lapping of the row at the connected end to open the switch element.

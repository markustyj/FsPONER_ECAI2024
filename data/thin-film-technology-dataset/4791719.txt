A first magnetic layer is formed upon a non-magnetic substrate, a gap layer is formed upon the first magnetic layer, a conductor coil covered with an insulation layer is formed upon the gap layer, a second magnetic layer is formed upon the gap layer and the insulation layer, a magnetic gap being formed between the first and second magnetic layers at a front portion facing a recording medium, and the second magnetic layer being connected to the first magnetic layer at a back portion. After forming a mask made of metal oxide upon the second magnetic layer, the second magnetic layer, the gap layer, and the first magnetic layer are formed into a predetermined shape respectively at the tip portion by dry etching. Thus, a high performance thin-film magnetic head having the same widths for the first and second magnetic layers is obtained.

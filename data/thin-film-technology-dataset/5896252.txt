A spin valve magnetoresistive effect magnetic head has a free magnetic layer having two sublayers composed of a CoFe sublayer and an NiFe sublayer. Alternatively, the two sublayers may be composed of a CoFe layer and an NiFe based alloy layer. The magnetic head further includes a nonmagnetic layer stacked on the CoFe layer, a pinned magnetic layer stacked on the nonmagnetic layer and an antiferromagnetic layer for fixing a magnetization direction of the pinned magnetic layer according to an exchange coupling between the pinned magnetic layer and the antiferromagnetic layer.

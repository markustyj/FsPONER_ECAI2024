A lapping monitor resistor for thin film transducers that rely upon an insulation layer to define a critical dimension includes a first conductive layer having a plurality of conductive blocks, an insulating layer formed over at least a portion of the first conductive layer, and a second conductive layer having a plurality of conductive blocks. The second conductive layer is electrically connected to the first conductive layer over portions where the insulating layer is not formed. A method of controlling lapping depth involves use of the lapping monitor resistor.

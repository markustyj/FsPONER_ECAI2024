 A method of manufacturing an integrated thin film head comprises, in order to prevent short-circuit among the lead layer, upper lead layer and shield layers, a lower shield layer formed on a substrate, a lower readgap layer formed on the lower shield layer, an MR sensor layer formed on the lower readgap layer, a lead layer jointed with the MR sensor layer, an upper lead layer formed in contact with a part of the lead layer, an upper readgap layer formed to cover the MR sensor layer, lead layer and upper lead layer and an upper shield layer formed on the upper readgap layer. The part of the lead layer in contact with the upper lead layer is formed thinner than the part not contact with the upper lead layer.

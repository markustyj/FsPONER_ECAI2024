Magnetoresistant magnetic reading head and process for producing the same. The head comprises a magnetoresistant strip beneath a magnetic spacer. This strip is obtained by etching using the spacer partly as a mask. Therefore, the magnetoresistant element is self-aligned with respect to the spacer and is buried beneath it. Such a device finds particular application in magnetic recording and reading.

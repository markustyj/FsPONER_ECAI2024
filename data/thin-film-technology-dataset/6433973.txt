A magnetoresistive sensor including spin valve sensor layers, an air bearing surface perpendicular to a first edge region common to the spin valve sensor layers, and a non-planar surface perpendicular to a second edge region common to the spin valve sensor layers and opposite the air bearing surface. The invention also features a method for producing a magnetoresistive sensor. The method includes forming a plurality of spin valve sensor layers, wherein an air bearing surface including a plane perpendicular to a first edge region common to the spin valve sensor layers is formed. Furthermore, a non-planar surface including a plane perpendicular to a second edge region common to the spin valve sensor layers, and opposite the air bearing surface is formed.

 A method and system for manufacturing a perpendicular magnetic recording transducer by a process that includes plating is described. The method and system include forming a chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) uniformity structure around a perpendicular magnetic recording pole. The CMP uniformity structure has a height substantially equal to a desired pole height. The method and system also include fabricating an insulator on the CMP uniformity structure and performing a CMP to remove a portion of the insulator. The CMP exposes a portion of the perpendicular magnetic recording pole and planarizes an exposed surface of the perpendicular magnetic recording transducer.

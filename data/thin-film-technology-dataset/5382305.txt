The soft magnetic thin film of the invention has an atomic ratio composition of the formula:wherein M is at least one member selected from the group consisting of Mg, Ca, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, and B, 0.001.ltoreq.x.ltoreq.0.15, 0.ltoreq.y.ltoreq.0.1, and 0.001.ltoreq.z.ltoreq.0.15, and has a relative intensity ratio of Fe (200) peak to Fe (110) peak in an X-ray diffraction spectrum of at least 1/3 and high Fe (100) orientation. It has excellent soft magnetic properties in that it has a high saturation magnetic flux density Bs, heat resistance, a low coercive force Hc, and a high magnetic permeability .mu.. A magnetic head using such a thin film has improved otherwise properties, recording/reproducing sensitivity, and electromagnetic properties, and is highly reliable.

A method for reducing feature size in a thin film magnetic write head includes plating a seed layer over a selected base layer, spinning a photoresist layer onto the seed layer, defining a trench in the photoresist layer, depositing an insulative spacer layer to cover the trench side walls using a low temperature chemical vapor deposition process, anisotropically etching to remove spacer layer material from the bottom of the trench and thereby expose the plating seed layer while leaving intact vertical portions of the spacer layer that cover the trench side walls and narrow its width, forming a structure of reduced feature size by electroplating metallic material into the narrowed trench, stripping away the photoresist layer and the spacer layer vertical portions, and milling or sputter etching the plating seed layer to leave a structure of reduced feature size.

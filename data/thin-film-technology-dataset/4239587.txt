In the electrodeposition of nickel-iron alloy layers during the manufacture of a thin-film magnetic head it is ensured that the nickel-iron alloy layer has a top layer having a higher iron content than the iron content of the remainder of the nickel-iron alloy layer. Since this top layer etches more rapidly than the remainder of the layer, the nickel-iron alloy layer itself becomes sloped during etching, this sloping configuration presents great advantages in the subsequent coating with a layer of silicon dioxide.

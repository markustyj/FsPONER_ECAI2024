 A method for preventing electrostatic discharge (ESD) damage in the head-suspension assembly (HSA) construction process. The method includes the use of a novel GMR magnetic recording head on a conductive slider substrate, the GMR head being electrically connected to the substrate and its conducting leads having balanced resistances between the leads and the substrate. By establishing an electrical connection between the GMR head and the slider substrate, the entire HSA can be grounded during its construction. By also grounding any nearby conducting elements that could inadvertently contact the HSA or its parts, no accumulated tribocharges can discharge through the sensitive GMR sensor element.

In a photographic system including means for magnetically recording/reproducing data relative to magnetically coated film, an assembly for conforming a thin film magnetic head array to the nonplanar magnetic surface during data transfer only, the assembly comprising: a platen for holding magnetically coated film in a film plane; a magnetic head array including first and second thin film heads located side-by-side and a third thin film head located fore or aft the first and second heads and forming an equilateral triangle of their centers; a head mounting spring fixed at one end to the platen and having a free end for mounting the magnetic head array adjacent to magnetically coated film transported through the film plane the mounting spring allowing pitch and roll movement of the head assembly; and a loading spring for biasing the magnetic head array into contact with the magnetically coated film so that the point of contact is at the center of gravity of the three head magnetic head array.

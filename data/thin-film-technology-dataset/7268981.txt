 In one illustrative example, a spin valve sensor includes a free layer structure; an anti-parallel (AP) pinned layer structure which includes at least a first AP pinned layer; and a non-magnetic electrically conductive spacer layer formed between the free layer structure and the AP pinned layer structure. First and second antiferromagnetic (AFM) pinning layer structures for magnetically pinning the first AP pinned layer are formed in end regions but are absent from its central region. Edges of each AFM pinning layer structure may be separated by a distance D.sub.A from the sensor edges. The first AP pinned layer is formed in both the central region and the end regions so as to be in contact with the first and second AFM pinning layer structures. Advantageously, adequate pinning properties are exhibited in a sensor which provides the benefits of a self-pinned sensor (e.g. a reduced sensor profile in the central region).

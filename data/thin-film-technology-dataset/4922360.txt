A magnetic head includes a magnetoresistance element having the form of a loop and provided with a gap at a first portion opposite to a second portion confronting a magnetic recording medium, a coil conductor formed around the first portion of the magnetoresistance element for applying a bias magnetic field to the second portion of the magnetoresistance element in the direction of width of a track on the magnetic recording medium, and a lead conductor attached to the magnetoresistance element to cause a current which is necessary for detecting a signal recorded on the magnetic recording medium, to flow through the second portion of the magnetoresistance element, and formed together with the coil conductor as one body so that a part of a current supplied to the lead conductor flows through the coil conductor.

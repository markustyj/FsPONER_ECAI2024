 A method and system for providing a magnetic recording transducer are disclosed. The method and system include providing a metallic underlayer directly on a portion of an insulating layer. The method and system also include forming a perpendicular magnetic recording pole on the metallic underlayer. The perpendicular magnetic recording pole has a top, a bottom narrower than the top, and sides. The perpendicular magnetic recording pole has a pole removal rate. The method and system also include providing an insulator having an insulator removal rate. The insulator substantially surrounds at least the sides of the perpendicular magnetic recording pole. The metallic underlayer has a removal rate that is at least one of less than the insulator removal rate and substantially equal to the pole removal rate.

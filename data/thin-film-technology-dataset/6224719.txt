A shield and/or pole piece layer for a magnetoresistive (MR) head made of a high moment Fe--Al--N--O laminated film is disclosed. The Fe--Al--N--O laminated film is manufactured using N.sub.2 O as the reactive gas, making a laminated film that has a high intrinsic anisotropic (H.sub.K) and can better withstand the processing fields employed during the various processing and annealing steps in the construction of the head. Accordingly, the magnetic domains of the first shield layer, the second shield layer and/or the pole piece layers do not change position from a desired parallel position to the ABS. By maintaining their parallel position, applied fields during the operation of the head, such as from the write head or the media, do not move the domain walls around to cause Barkhausen noise.

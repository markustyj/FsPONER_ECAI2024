A thin-film magnetic head constructed in the manner that a magnetic circuit is composed of a base of magnetic material and a thin-film magnetic core layer, which form an operating gap at the front end thereof and a rear junction at the rear end of the magnetic core layer, and a conductor layer forming a winding is provided between the base and the magnetic core layer. The magnetic core layer has a larger width at the portion where it crosses over the conductor layer, than at the operating gap portion, whereby magnetic fluxes generated by electric current flowing through the conductor layer are effectively passed through the magnetic core layer and so recording efficiency is improved.

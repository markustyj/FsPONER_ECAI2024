A combined read head and write head includes at least one write coil layer embedded in an insulation stack. The insulation stack is sandwiched between first and second pole piece layers that are connected at a back gap. The pole piece layers have first and second pole tips that have edges that form a portion of an air bearing surface. A write gap layer that forms a portion of the air bearing surface is sandwiched between a top surface of the first pole tip and a bottom surface of the second pole tip. A non-magnetic electrically conductive layer on top of the second pole tip forms a portion of the air bearing surface. A magnetoresistive sensor is sandwiched between first and second gap layers, which are sandwiched between first and second shield layers. The second shield layer is a common layer with the first pole piece layer.

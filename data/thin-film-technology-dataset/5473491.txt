The present invention discloses a thin film magnetic head having lower and upper cores, a rear intermediate core interposed between rear portions of the lower and upper cores, a pair of front intermediate cores interposed between front portions of the lower and upper cores and a magnetic gap interposed between the pair of the front intermediate cores, the thin film magnetic head. The rear portions of the lower and upper cores having wider cross-sectional area than those of the front portions of the lower and upper cores which are connected to the rear portions thereof forming an inflection point. In order to prevent the magnetic saturation of the front portions of the lower and upper cores, extended portions are respectively provided on the lower and upper cores by causing distal ends of the front intermediate cores to be extended beyond the inflection point. Further, a spacer of a non-magnetic material, having a longer thickness than that of the magnetic gap, is interposed between the extended portions to prevent the leakage flux between the extended portions.

 The method of making a thin-film magnetic head in accordance with the present invention forms a cover layer on an insulating layer about a magnetoresistive film so as to eliminate a protrusion riding on the magnetoresistive film. The protrusion can be eliminated by etching. The part of insulating layer clad with the cover layer is not etched. This can prevent short-circuit from occurring because of thinning the insulating layer.

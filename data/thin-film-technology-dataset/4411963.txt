A thin film of magnetic recording material is sputter deposited over a base layer of gold and tantalum on a polished substrate. A protective layer of gold and tantalum is deposited overlaying the magnetic recording film. A solid lubricant layer such as carbon, preferably in the form of graphite, gold, silver, tin, molybdenum disulfide, and tungsten disulfide is sputter deposited or ion plated over the protective layer to reduce wear. The recording contacting portion of the recording head is similarly coated with a solid lubricant material. Other suitable protective materials include tantalum, niobium, tungsten and nitrides and carbides of such metals. In a preferred method for making such recording members, the layers are successively sputter deposited in an evacuated sputter chamber, whereby the recording layers and protective coatings are formed in a continuous process requiring only one pump down.

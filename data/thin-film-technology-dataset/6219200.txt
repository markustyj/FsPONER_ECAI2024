A thin-film magnetic head in which the end face of a magnetic film protrudes beyond a substrate within the air bearing surface of the magnetic head. The magnetic film being made of a material containing a metallic element which is lap polished with abrasive grains containing the hydroxide of the metallic element. Because the air bearing surface is constructed according to the above procedure, the bit length of a magnetic disk can be decreased to ensure a higher record density.

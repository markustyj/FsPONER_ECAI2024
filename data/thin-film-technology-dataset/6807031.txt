A transducing head includes at least three magnetic layers. At least two of these magnetic layers function as shields of a reader portion of the transducing head, and at least one of these magnetic layers functions as a pole of a writer portion of the transducing head. Importantly, at least one of the three magnetic layers is formed of a thin film structure having a first and a second ferromagnetic layer, a nonmagnetic spacer layer, and a bias layer. The spacer layer is positioned between the first and the second ferromagnetic layers. The bias layer is positioned adjacent the first ferromagnetic layer. The second ferromagnetic layer has a thickness-magnetic moment product substantially equal to a thickness-magnetic moment product of the first ferromagnetic layer. An easy axis of the second ferromagnetic layer is substantially parallel to an easy axis of the first ferromagnetic layer.

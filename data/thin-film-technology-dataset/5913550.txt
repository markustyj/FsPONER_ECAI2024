In a method for fabricating a magnetic head in which a block is cut from a wafer, and either the element height of a magnetoresistive head or the gap depth of a thin-film magnetic head is machined to a prescribed value, a resistance monitoring pattern for monitoring element height machining, said monitoring pattern comprising a first resistance pattern having a surface area which decreases in a nearly linear manner as machining progresses in the direction that reduces the element height and a second resistance pattern having a surface area which decreases in nearly piecewise linear manner as machining progresses in the direction that reduces the element height, is formed on the wafer block at the time of said wafer process, a determination being made during the machining and based on the resistance value of the resistance monitoring pattern, of the timing of stopping the machining which reduces the element height.

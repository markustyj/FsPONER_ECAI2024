The transducer for perpendicular magnetic recording comprises a core of high permeability material having a recording pole and a flux return pole spaced apart and connected by an intermediate member forming an inverted generally U-shaped core. The cross sectional area of the flux return pole is substantially greater than that of the recording pole. Current applied to a coil wound around the recording pole generates flux for recording on the magnetic medium. A similarly shaped second core may be disposed on the opposite side of the medium with respect to the first core for providing a flux return path for the first core. A sub-core of high permeability material mounted on the flux return pole forms a gap with the recording pole to provide a ring-type head for data recovery. Current applied to a coil wound on the sub-core saturates the sub-core to render it ineffective during perpendicular magnetic writing. During reading the sub-core winding is de-energized, transforming the perpendicular magnetic recording head into a ring-type reading head. An alternative reading embodiment utilizes magneto-resistive elements disposed between the recording pole and the flux return pole.

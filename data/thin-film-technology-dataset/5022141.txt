A method of manufacturing a multiturn coil and a thin film magnetic head including a multiturn coil.This multiturn coil manufacturing method includes the following steps. First a laminate made up of conducting layers and insulating layers for coil is formed on a base member on a substrate and having a given inclination. Then this laminate is formed into a loop shape with a space or discontinuity thereon. In the next step, the upper part of the laminate on opposite sides of the space is removed to form a flat surface parallel to the substrate in which the ends of all the conducting layers are exposed. Finally, film conductive strips are connected between these exposed portions across the discontinuity to complete a multiturn coil.

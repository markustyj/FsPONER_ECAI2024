A thin-film magnetic head has a semiconductor substrate in which there is an integrated circuit, and on which a magnetic layer structure is arranged. During manufacturing the integrated circuit is formed on one side of the semiconductor substrate, and that side of the semiconductor substrate is then secured to a carrier body by a securing layer. The substrate may then be ground or etched to a thickness less than 35.mu.m before forming the magnetic layer structure on the opposite side. Securing to the carrier body prevents deformation of the layer structure during manufacturing, so that the resulting head has reproducible properties. Preferably a support body is secured over the layer structure. The head face is then formed such that the layer structure and the support and carrier bodies terminate in it.

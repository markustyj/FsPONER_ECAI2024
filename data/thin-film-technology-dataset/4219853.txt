A method of making a thin film inductive head assembly, which has separate read and write transducers, comprises the steps of depositing the elemental layers of one thin film transducer on a substrate; sputter depositing on the transducer a thick transparent insulating layer; flat lapping the thick insulating layer; depositing the elemental layers of a second thin film transducer on the flat lapped insulating layer; and depositing a thick insulating overcoat on the second thin film transducer. The substrate is then configured as a slider element for flying in transducing relation over a record medium, such as a rotary magnetic disk. The resultant structure includes thin film read and write transducers with a thick transparent insulating layer therebetween, all deposited successively in layers on one surface of the substrate, and having a protective insulating overcoat.

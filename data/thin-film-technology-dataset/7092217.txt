 A magnetoresistive head of CPP structure in which an insulating protective film 20 covers at least part of the boundary between the lower shield layer 10 and the non-magnetic film 11 adjacent thereto so as to reduce the area of the lower shield layer which is exposed on the surface of the substrate when the magnetoresistive film is patterned. This construction minimizes damage that occurs when the magnetoresistive film is patterned and also reduces the fraction defective due to current leakage across the upper and lower shields.

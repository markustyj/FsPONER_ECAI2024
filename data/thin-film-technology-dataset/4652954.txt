A method for making a thin film magnetic head assembly comprising the steps of depositing a first magnetic pole piece layer, depositing a nonmagnetic material gap forming layer, and depositing a protective layer of etch resistant material. A layer of insulation is deposited upon which is formed a conductive coil. A leveling pad of insulation is deposited over the conductive coil, and the part of the protective layer which is not covered by the insulation is removed. The gap forming layer is therefore protected during the processing steps so that a desired gap length is produced. The second magnetic pole piece layer is then deposited to complete the magnetic circuit.

A thin film magnetic head is provided in which a magnetic yoke assembly is built up, layer by layer, atop a substrate using semiconductor thin film techniques. A lower yoke assembly is first fabricated including a lower magnetic layer situated on the substrate and first and second side poles built up vertically from the ends of the lower magnetic layer. An insulative pedestal surrounded by a frame is formed at the top of the lower yoke assembly and extends above the uppermost lateral plane of the yoke assembly. A diamond-like carbon (DLC) wear layer is deposited atop the pedestal. First and second pole wells are excavated in the DLC layer so as to expose the first and second side poles therebelow and to form a DLC gap region between the first and second side poles. First and second magnetic poles are then formed in the first and second pole wells, respectively.

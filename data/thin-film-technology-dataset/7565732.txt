 A method of fabricating a magnetic write head, in accordance with one embodiment, includes forming a beveled write pole. A conformal spacer may be formed upon a portion of a flare length proximate a tip of the write pole. A shield layer may also be formed upon the conformal spacer adjacent the flare length proximate the tip of the write pole.

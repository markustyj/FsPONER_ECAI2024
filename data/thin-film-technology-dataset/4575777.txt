A magnetic recording and reproducing head which operates in a perpendicular magnetization mode which records and reproduces information on a magnetic recording medium. The head includes first and second members spaced apart so as to define a gap therebetween through which said medium can travel. The first member includes a magnetic pole of high permeable magnetic thin film having a tip which faces the medium. A first coil is wound around the thin film and the second member includes a second coil. The tip of the thin film faces the second coil. The second member and its second coil and thin film are used for recording whereas the thin film and first coil are used for reproducing.

In a magnetoresistive (MR) read sensor in which the MR layer is transversely biased by a soft magnetic layer separated from the MR layer by a nonmagnetic spacer layer an antiferromagnetic stabilization layer of NiO provides a stabilizing exchange-coupled magnetic field to the transverse bias layer insuring that the transverse bias layer is fully saturated in a preferred direction during sensor operation.

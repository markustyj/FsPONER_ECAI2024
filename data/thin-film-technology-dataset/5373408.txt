A thin film magnetic head is fabricated with shaping magnetic thin films, preferably formed of Permalloy, which have a stepped configuration. The thin films are deposited between the insulation layer surrounding the electrical coil and below the second pole layer P2 to form a double yoke. The thin films have corners at the stepped areas which pin the domain sites so that the magnetization of the P2 layer is properly aligned, thereby improving the data signal that is being recorded.

The invention comprises a pair of dual stripe magnetoresistive (DSMR) sensor elements with aligned edges of a pair of patterned magnetoresistive (MR) layers within the pair of dual stripe magnetoresistive (DSMR) sensor elements. A first embodiment of the dual stripe magnetoresistive (DSMR) sensor element employs a patterned first magnetoresistive (MR) layer, a patterned inter stripe dielectric layer and a patterned second magnetoresistive (MR) layer which are areally co-extensive, and thus have all edges thereof fully aligned. A second embodiment of the dual stripe magnetoresistive (DSMR) sensor element employs a patterned first magnetoresistive (MR) layer, a pattern ed inter stripe dielectric layer and a patterned second magnetoresistive (MR) layer, where: (1) at least a portion of an edge of the patterned first magnetoresistive (MR) layer, the pattern ed inter stripe dielectric layer and the patterned second magnetoresistive (MR layer opposite an air bearing surface (ABS) of the dual stripe magnetoresistive (DSMR) sensor element are fully aligned; and (2) there is employed a patterned backfilling dielectric layer covering those fully aligned edges of the patterned first magnetoresistive (MR) layer, the pattern ed inter stripe dielectric layer and the patterned second magnetoresistive (MR) layer, where the patterned backfilling dielectric layer does not completely cover a top surface of the patterned second magnetoresistive (MR) layer.

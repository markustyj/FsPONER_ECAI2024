 A method for removing a thin metallic layer using an etchant solution is provided for essentially eliminating undercutting in a thin metallic layer such as a seed layer in a magnetic recording head. The etchant solution has a suitable solvent additive such as glycerol or methyl cellulose. With suitable solvent additives, which generally increase solvent viscosity, lateral etching rates are similar to surface etch rates and undercutting is essentially eliminated.

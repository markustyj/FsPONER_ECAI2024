 A heater member is formed in structure including a heater layer with a low electrical resistivity and a cap layer with a higher electrical resistivity, an electrically conductive electrode film is formed thereon, and electrically conductive bumps are formed thereon by plating. Unnecessary part of the electrode film is removed using the bumps as a mask. The heater member generates heat to thermally expand a thin-film magnetic head, whereby the distance is reduced between a recording medium and, a magnetoresistive device and/or an electromagnetic conversion device. During removal of the electrode film part of the cap layer with the higher electrical resistivity in the heater member is removed together with the electrode film, which reduces the variation in the total resistance of the heater member.

The magnetic layer of a head structure can satisfy the characteristics of both the magnetic shield layer and magnetic pole layer for recording by bringing the combined upper part and lower part of the magnetic layer respectively into conformity with the widths necessary for the shield layer and for the magnetic pole, e.g., specifically, by disposing a taper or more specifically a step shape to the section of the magnetic layer to have the dimension of the upper part of the magnetic layer different from that of the lower part. The width of the magnetic layer facing one of the recording magnetic poles can be brought into conformity with the track width. Accordingly, the flux at the time of a write operation concentrates on the track width portion and hence, side writing of the recording head can be reduced. On the other hand, the width of the magnetic head on the opposed side to the magnetoresistive sensor can be extended sufficiently to fully cover the sensor. For this reason, the noise picked up by the magnetoresistive sensor resulting from the signal flux from the adjacent tracks can be reduced.

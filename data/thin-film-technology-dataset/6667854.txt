In a magnetic head, a head element and bumps connected thereto are formed on one end face of a slider substrate, and an insulating film is formed on the other end face opposite from the one end face. Therefore, even when the slider is electrically charged, the other end face thereof does not contact bumps formed in another slider substrate, and charges of the slider substrate will not move into the bumps. This prevents the slider substrate from electrostatic damage.

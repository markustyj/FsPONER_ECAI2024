A thin film magnetic head is fabricated on a substrate by depositing a lower shield layer on the substrate. A lower layer of a magnetic yoke is situated on the lower shield layer to couple the yoke to the shield. Alternatively, the magnetic yoke is isolated from the lower shield layer by an insulative layer therebetween. At the same time that first and second magnetic side poles are built up layer by layer via successive plating operations at the respective ends of a lower magnetic layer of the yoke, a side shield structure is plated up, layer by layer, at the periphery of the lower shield layer to surround resultant side pole structure. A shield cover is plated on the top of the side shield to substantially enclose the side pole structure, but leave an opening for an insulative pedestal though which the tops of the side poles extend. First and second magnetic poles are plated to the tops of the first and second side poles such that a gap region of non-magnetic material is formed therebetween.

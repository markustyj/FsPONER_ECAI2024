 A magnetic recording head comprises a write pole having a tip adjacent to an air bearing surface of the recording head, a return pole magnetically coupled to the write pole, a conductor positioned adjacent to an edge of the write pole at the air bearing surface, a first conductive heat sink connected to the conductor, and a second conductive heat sink connected to the conductor, wherein at least a portion of each of the first and second conductive heat sinks is positioned adjacent to the air bearing surface and wherein each of the first and second conductive heat sinks includes a structure for augmenting confinement of a magnetic write field adjacent to the write pole. Magnetic storage devices that include the magnetic recording head are also included.

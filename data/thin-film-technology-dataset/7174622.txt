 A method of fabrication of a slider includes forming a first ferromagnetic layer, a second ferromagnetic layer, and an antiferromagnetic layer and applying a layer of protective material to proximal ends of those layers that are proximal to the disk surface. The method further includes recessing a proximal end of a non-magnetic metal layer formed on the first ferromagnetic layer from the disk surface to form at least one recessed area. The method also includes filling the recessed area with protective material to a depth such that when the layer of protective material is worn from the ends of the first ferromagnetic layer, the second ferromagnetic layer, and the antiferromagnetic layer by burnishing of the ends by the disk surface, protective material still remains in the recessed area of the non-magnetic metal layer.

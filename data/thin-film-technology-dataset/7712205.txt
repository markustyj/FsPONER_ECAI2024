 In a magnetic head manufacturing method, a floated surface of each block having plural magnetic head elements formed and arranged on a substrate is ground and lapped in a grinding/lapping step. The grinding/lapping step contains an angle adjusting step for adjusting the angle of the floated surface of the block with reference to a magnetic-head-element formed surface of a substrate and grinding the floated surface concerned, and a finishing lapping step of lapping the floated surface at an angle adjusted in the angle adjusting step.

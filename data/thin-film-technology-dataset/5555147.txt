In a combined thin film magnetic head comprising reading and recording parts which are formed on a main surface of a non-magnetic substrate for magnetically reading and recording information on a magnetic recording medium, the reading part comprises an under shield pattern, an upper shield pattern, and a magneto-resistive element formed between the under and the upper shield patterns. The under and the upper shield patterns have restricted areas which are much smaller than the main surface of the non-magnetic substrate. The recording part comprises a conductor member with a coil pattern. An outer periphery portion of the coil pattern is out of a forming area which is for forming the reading part.

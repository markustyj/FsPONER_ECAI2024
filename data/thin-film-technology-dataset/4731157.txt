In a magnetic material film is etched a first wide, closed channel leaving intact an elongated central portion having a rectilinear axis. A coil is formed in the channel and surrounds the central portion, while being electrically insulated by a dielectric layer. A second channel is etched in a dielectric layer having a planar lateral edge parallel to the axis of the central portion and a thin magnetic film is deposited. A dielectric layer is deposited and etched by RIE, so as to leave a wall on the lateral edge. The magnetic film is then chemically etched so as to leave behind only the portion deposited on the lateral edge. Finally, the second channel is filled with a third hard dielectric material similar to the first.

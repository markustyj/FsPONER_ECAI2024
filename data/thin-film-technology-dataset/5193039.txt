Method and apparatus for supplying bias to a magnetoresistive element in an encapsulated thin film head for reducing the likelihood of generation of Barkhausen noise when reading flux from a magnetic storage disk. The invention achieves a relatively uniform easy axis bias field in an easy to implement manner by creating a magnetic bias structure on the encapsulated heat at the same time as providing the contact pads for the MR element.

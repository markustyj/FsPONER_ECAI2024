A thin-film head electromagnetic transducer has two pole pieces which define a gap. The surface of at least one of the pole pieces has a linear edge defining one side of the gap and has two linear edges which are at an acute angle to the linear edge defining the gap and are symmetric about and abut at an axis perpendicular to the linear edge defining the gap.

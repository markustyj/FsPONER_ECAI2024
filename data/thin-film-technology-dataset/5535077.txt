A magnetoresistive effect magnetic head having a film comprising laminated first and second magnetoresistive elements with an electrically conductive intermediate film therebetween, and a pair of shield members positioned on both sides of the laminated film. Even if a magnetic gap of the head is reduced in length, the magnetic equilibrium of the first and second magneto-resistive elements may be stabilized by allowing over 10% of the current through the film to go through the intermediate film, thereby enabling a high playback output to be produced when reproducing signals on a magnetic medium.

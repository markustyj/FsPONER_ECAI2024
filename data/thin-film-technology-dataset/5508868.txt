A sensing head for detecting flux representative of signals recorded on a magnetic medium includes dual magnetoresistive (MR) elements, an in-gap flux guide partly disposed between the elements and a flux closure piece having ends located adjacent to the ends of the MR elements. The assembly provides increased signal sensitivity and minimizes or eliminates the possibility of electrical or magnetic shorting of the elements which may occur by smearing of the MR sensing elements if the elements are disposed at the air bearing surface of a head slider in contact with a rotating disk.

 A method of manufacturing a thin-film magnetic head including the step of forming a thin-film coil. The step of forming the thin-film coil forms: a flat first coil of a single turn; a flat second coil of two turns arranged to sandwich the first coil from inner and outer sides thereof; a flat third coil of a single turn located above the first and second coils; and a flat fourth coil of two turns arranged to sandwich the third coil from inner and outer sides thereof. The first and fourth coils are connected in series to constitute a first three-turn coil. The second and third coils are connected in series to constitute a second three-turn coil. The first three-turn coil and the second three-turn coil are connected in series.

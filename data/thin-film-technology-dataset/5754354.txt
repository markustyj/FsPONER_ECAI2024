A magnetic disk drive unit includes a first read amplifier connected to an inductive head, a second read amplifier connected to a magneto-resistive head, a selective output unit for selecting either an output of the first read amplifier or an output of the second read amplifier and supplying a selected output to a demodulator, and a control unit for supplying a switching control signal. When reading servo information written onto a data surface of a magnetic recording medium, the control unit controls the switching control signal and thus causes the selective output unit to select an output of the first read amplifier associated with the inductive head. By the constitution, servo information can be detected in a wide range using a relatively simple data-surface servo pattern. This realizes high-precision off-tracking compensation.

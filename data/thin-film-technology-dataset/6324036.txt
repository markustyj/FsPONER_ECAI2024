An apparatus and method of making is disclosed for a combination read/write head having improved topography. The disclosed read/write head combines a magnetoresistive (MR) read head with an inductive magnetic write head. The head is planarized at a second shield layer with a planarization layer such that pads and leads connecting the pads to the MR sensor and coil are on a planar surface of the planaritzation layer. This planarization layer allows first and second shield layers to be optimized for the MR sensor to be used and also separates the pads and leads from the substrate. The combination head has first and second shield layers formed on a substrate, the shield layers being separated by a read gap. A magnetoresistive (MR) sensor and MR leads are located in the read gap. The planarization layer is then formed on the substrate, surrounding the first and second shield layers creating a planar surface that is coplanar with a top surface of the second shield layer. A write gap layer is fabricated along with a pole piece. The pole piece being separated by the write gap layer at the ABS and connected to the second shield layer at a back gap that is recessed in the head from the ABS. An insulation layer and coil layer embedded in the insulation layer with the insulation layer and the coil layer being located between the second shield layer and the pole piece. Pads and leads are formed on the planarization layer, with the leads electrically connected to the MR sensor and the coil.

The head includes a read pole disposed between a pair of write poles spaced apart to form a gap therebetween. The read pole conducts flux to a flux sensor that is located away from the gap. The head can be utilized for both longitudinal and perpendicular recording and the readback function can be carried out by an inductive coil or flux sensing devices such as a Hall sensor or an MR sensor. The recording head achieves high readback resolution, high write field gradients, and the capability for write wide-read narrow. The read pole and write poles are laminated structures.

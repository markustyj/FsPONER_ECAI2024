A method for fabricating balanced shield connections for noise reduction MR/GMR read heads and an MR/MGR read head so fabricated. The present invention teaches a method for forming a balanced electrical half-bridge in parallel with the MR/GMR element of a read head so as to reduce readback noise caused by discharges between the two ends of the MR/GMR sensor element, which are at different potentials as a result of the bias current passing through the sensor, and the magnetic shields, whose potential is constant. The half-bridge is connected to each of the magnetic shields by interconnects attached to a pad at its mid-point, thus placing the shields at the same average potential as the sensor element.

A method and apparatus for fabricating a submicrometer structure. The method incorporates a sputtering process to deposit an electromagnetic material from a seedlayer onto a vertical sidewall. The vertical sidewall is subsequently removed, leaving a free-standing pole-tip. The resulting structure formed can have a a width of less than 0.3 micrometers, if desired. This structure can be used as a magnetic pole of a thin film head ("TFH") for a data storage device.

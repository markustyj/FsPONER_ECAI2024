 The inner side end faces of electrode layers are formed in a region under which bias layers are not formed, to be located behind a magnetoresistive film in the height direction. Therefore, a sensing current flowing from the electrode layers can be appropriately inhibited from shunting to the bias layers, thereby permitting the manufacture of a magnetic sensing element capable of complying with track narrowing and suppressing variations in the track width Tw.

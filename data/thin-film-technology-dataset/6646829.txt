An object of the invention is to facilitate processing and to obtain sliders as many as possible when the sliders for thin-film magnetic heads are manufactured through the use of a circular-plate-shaped wafer in which a plurality of rows of sections to be the sliders are aligned. The circular-plate-shaped wafer includes the rows of the sections to be the sliders aligned in one orientation. Each of the sections to be the sliders includes a thin-film magnetic head element. Three types of slider materials having different widths are cut out from the wafer. Each of the three types of slider materials includes rows of the sections to be the sliders. Processing including lapping is performed on a surface to be medium facing surfaces of each of the three types of slider materials. The materials are then separated to form slider aggregates each of which includes one of the rows of the sections to be the sliders. Rails are formed in a surface to be the medium facing surfaces of the slider aggregates. The slider aggregates are then separated.

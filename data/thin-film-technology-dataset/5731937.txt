A thin film magnetic transducer employs a giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensing element operating in a (CPP) current-perpendicular-to-the-plane mode. Electrical lead members in electric contact with the sensing element provide for the flow of sensor current through the giant magnetoresistive element. The height, or both the height and the width, of the GMR sensing element are greater than the height, or both the height and width respectively, of the lead members, thereby resulting in an increased output signal from the transducer.

A method for preventing and controlling Arcing Across Thin Dielectric Film in sputtering and other process that generate electric fields and cause arcing across conductive structures. In a first embodiment, when the wafer is subjected to RF electric fields from a RF generating tool, the leads are oriented in a first direction which is perpendicular to the RF fields (in a second direction) generated by a RF generating tool (e.g., sputter tool). In a second embodiment, leads are shaped so that the leads extend on both sides of the ABS line so that the MR window 40 is close to the geometric center of the leads. In a third embodiment, an extraneous window or two extraneous windows are formed in a second dielectric layer under at least of a portion of a lead to that a "hot spot" area is created where arcing is more likely to occur.

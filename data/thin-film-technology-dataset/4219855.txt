A thin film magnetic transducer comprises a non-magnetic substrate and a pair of magnetic pole pieces having different widths. The width of the first pole piece deposited on the substrate is greater than that of the second pole piece to prevent a problem associated with misregistration between the pole pieces, which may occur during manufacture. Such misregistration generally results in a "wraparound", so that the edge of the second pole piece would have an extended portion forming an angle to the normal magnetic transitions created by the pole pieces. The width of the second pole piece is slightly less than the effective width of the data track recorded on a magnetic medium, and the data track width is relatively independent of the dimension of the first pole piece.

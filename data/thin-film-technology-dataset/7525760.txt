 Embodiments of the present invention recite a write gap structure for a magnetic recording head. In one embodiment, the write gap structure comprises at least one layer of inert material is disposed proximate to the P2 pole of a magnetic recording head. A layer of magnetic material is disposed between the layer of inert material and the P1 pedestal (P1P) of the magnetic recording head. In embodiments of the present invention, the write gap structure further comprises a second layer of inert material is disposed between the layer of magnetic material and the P1P of the magnetic recording head. In embodiments of the present invention, the write gap structure only overlies a portion of the write gap of the magnetic recording head with reference to the throat height dimension of the write gap.

A recording head has a bottom pole layer and a top pole layer that include pole portions, and a recording gap layer placed between the pole portions. The recording head further has a thin-film coil placed between the bottom and top pole layers, the coil being insulated from the pole layers. The bottom pole layer includes a first portion and a second portion. The first portion is located in a region facing toward the thin-film coil, an insulating layer being placed between the bottom pole layer and the coil. The second portion is connected to a surface of the first portion facing toward the thin-film coil. The second portion forms the pole portion and defines a throat height. The thin-film coil is located on a side of the second portion. Throat height TH is greater than MR height MR-H.

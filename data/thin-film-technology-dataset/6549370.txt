A recording head incorporates a bottom pole layer including a pole portion and a top pole layer including a pole portion, and a recording gap layer placed between the pole portions. The recording head further incorporates a thin-film coil placed between the bottom and top pole layers, the coil being insulated from the pole layers. The bottom pole layer includes the pole portion, a flat portion and a sloped portion. The pole portion touches the recording gap layer. The sloped portion connects the pole portion and the flat portion to each other. The distance from the sloped portion to the gap layer decreases as the distance from the air bearing surface decreases. The shapes of the pole portion and the sloped portion are defined by a convexity forming layer formed on a top shield layer of a reproducing head. The top pole layer is formed on a flat top surface of the gap layer.

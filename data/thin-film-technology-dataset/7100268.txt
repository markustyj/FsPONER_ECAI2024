 A method of making a magnetic head includes imbedding a coil layer in an insulation stack. The coil layer is formed with a filament that extends about a central axis. The central axis is perpendicular to a planar head surface and a coil plane. First and second pole pieces are formed with the insulation stack sandwiched between the first and second pole pieces. A first shield layer having first and second major planar thin film surfaces is joined by a third edge with the first major planar thin film surface of the first shield layer forming a portion of the planar head surface. A magnetoresistive (MR) sensor and first and second gap layers are formed with the MR sensor sandwiched between the first and second gap layers and the first and second gap layers located between the third edge and the first horizontal component and with the MR sensor and the first and second gap layers forming portions of the planar head surface.

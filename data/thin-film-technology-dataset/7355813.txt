 An article is formed as a substrate having a projection extending outwardly therefrom. The article may be a magnetic recording head and the projection a write pole. The projection has a width in a thinnest dimension measured parallel to a substrate surface of no more than about 0.3 micrometers and a height measured perpendicular to the substrate of not less than about 5 times the width. The article is fabricated by forming an overlying structure on the substrate with an edge thereon, depositing a replication layer lying on the edge, depositing a filler onto the edge and the substrate, so that the filler, the replication layer, and the overlying structure in combination comprise a continuous layer on the substrate, selectively removing at least a portion of the replication layer from a free surface of the continuous layer inwardly toward the substrate, to form a defined cavity, and depositing a projection material into the defined cavity to form the projection.

A magneto-resistive (MR) head includes protection from electrostatic discharge without introducing additional processing steps. The MR sensor comprises a soft film biased (SFB) magnetic read sensor sandwiched between two high resistivity magnetic materials. The MR sensor is located between two MR shields wherein each MR shield is connected to an MR sensor ground signal lead by a resistor. The resistor is constructed from the high resistivity magnetic material such that the resistor is deposited at the same process step as the MR sensor.

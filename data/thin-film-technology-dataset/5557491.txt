A thin film orthogonal MR head is provided which includes a single MR stripe, a first lead layer which has first and second ends and a second lead layer which has first and second ends, the first end of the first lead layer being connected to the bottom portion of the MR stripe and the first end of the second lead layer being connected to a top portion of the MR stripe. First and second terminals are provided, the second end of the first layer being connected to the first terminal and the second end of the second lead layer being connected to the second terminal. The second lead layer extends across the MR stripe between the top and bottom portions of the MR stripe so as to induce a magnetic bias field into the MR stripe when a sense current is conducted through the MR stripe via the first and second terminals. Only the first and second terminals are employed for providing sense current for the MR stripe and transverse biasing of the MR stripe. The first lead is substantially planar across a bottom portion of the MR stripe so that a well formed second pole tip of a write head portion can be constructed.

 The optimum head-field intensity for saturation recording is assumed to be 560.times.10.sup.3 A/m or more. Under a condition where the recording track width of an information recording medium is equal to or less than 60 nm, the optimum head-field intensity Y satisfies the following inequalities (1) and (2): Y.gtoreq.(X.sup.2-119.times.X+4135).times.1000 (1) Y.ltoreq.(X.sup.2-119.times.X+const).times.1000 (2) where X denotes the nondimensional value of the recording track width divided by 10.sup.-9 m, and Y denotes a magnetic field (expressed in units of A/m) which a magnetic pole for head-field application applies to the center of the information recording medium in the direction of the thickness thereof. Note that const=-0.8.times.v.sup.2+33.7.times.v+4250 if the relative velocity v between the head and the medium at the position of the head is less than 20 m/sec, or const=4600 if the velocity v is equal to or more than 20 m/sec.

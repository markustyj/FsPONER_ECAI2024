A method of manufacturing a magnetic head which includes a first step of roughening one surface of a core block formed by a polycrystalline magnetic material, a second step of forming a first core member by forming a metallic magnetic film on the one surface, and a third step of joining two core members, at least one of which is the first core member, through a non-magnetic material, so as to form a magnetic gap between them.

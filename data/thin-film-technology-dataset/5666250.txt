A thin film head (12) and a method for fabricating the same comprises depositing a first nickel seed layer (37) on a substrate (25), forming a bottom portion (16) of a magnetic core (13) on the first nickel seed layer (37), depositing a second nickel layer (39) and forming a top portion (14) of the magnetic core (13) on the second nickel seed layer (39). The stability of the thin film head (12) while in a relaxed state and its read performance are significantly improved.

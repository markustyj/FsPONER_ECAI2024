A thin film transducer having a substrate, a first and second pole piece formed of a selected magnetic material and terminating in a gap, a coil positioned between the first and second pole pieces and a magnetically conductive layer formed of a material having selected chemical, magnetic and physical properties and having a known magnetic saturation flux density and being positioned contiguous at least one of the first pole piece and second pole piece and rearward of the edges forming the gap to conduct magnetic flux in parallel to the pole pieces and to increase and concentrate the magnetic flux density at the edges of the first and second pole piece defining the gap is shown.

A thin-film magnetic head includes an insulation gap, first and second yoke layers with first and second ends, respectively, the first ends constituting magnetic poles separated from each other by the insulation gap, the second ends being magnetically coupled with each other, and a coil conductor constituted by a plurality of single layer turns, for generating magnetic field and applying the generated magnetic field into the first and second yoke layers. Each turn of the coil conductor includes a first section, a second section with one end coupled with one end of the first section, and a third section with one end coupled with the other end of the second section. The third section travels to pass outside of the first yoke layer in parallel with the surface of the first yoke layer, and to extend over the first yoke layer.

A method for making a thin film magnetic head in which the pole tips are trimmed to a predetermined width prior to the completion of the magnetic yoke structure. The thin film magnetic head is produced through deposition of the first magnetic layer in two stages, through deposition of the coil, the insulating material for the coil and through deposition of the second magnetic layer. The thin film head is then masked by a photoresist mask having openings to expose specific parts of the pole tip region, and an ion milling operation is used to etch the head assembly to form pole tips having a predetermined width. The shaping layer for the second magnetic layer is then deposited to complete the magnetic yoke structure.

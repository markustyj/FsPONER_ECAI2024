A batch fabricated multi-element head is made from interlocking ferrite parts to form a low contoured surface for interfacing with a magnetic medium, such as a flexible disk. On another surface, a multi-turn conductive coil is formed by thin film process and cooperates with a flux path bar to define the magnetic flux field.

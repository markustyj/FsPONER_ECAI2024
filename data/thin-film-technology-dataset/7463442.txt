 Embodiments of the present invention relate to an impedance-matched write driver circuit which comprises a voltage source, a write driver circuit electrically coupled to the voltage source, a signal input coupled so as to effect the output of the write driver circuit, and an impedance matching circuit electrically coupled to the write driver circuit, wherein the impedance matching circuit is enabled to damp the output oscillations in the output of the write driver circuit. Importantly, the impedance of the impedance-matched write driver circuit is selectable by component selection or by logic. Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to a system, e.g., a magnetic disk storage unit that makes use of the write driver as described herein.

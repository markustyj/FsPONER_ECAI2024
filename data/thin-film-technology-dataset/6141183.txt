A pole-trimmed writer for an MR read/write data transducer which may be produced without significant re-deposition of Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 or NiFe on the sides of the writer poles. The process disclosed herein advantageously provides an upper (top) pole which is processed to project a pair of relatively thin, laterally extending lower flanges, prior to the use of the upper pole as a mask to subsequent ion milling of the lower pole, or shared shield. In a preferred embodiment, the process for producing the flange is implemented in conjunction with the deposition of a single copper (Cu) or dual Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 and chromium (Cr) overlayers formed on the upper pole seed layer followed by the top pole formation and selective removal of a predetermined amount of the underlying portions of the gap material prior to a subsequent ion milling operation and further processing of the read/write head.

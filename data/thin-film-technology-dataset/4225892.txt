An MR head is disclosed in which the MR element is deposited onto a sapphire substrate with a particular crystallographic orientation and a sapphire closure piece also having a particular crystallographic orientation is used. The substrate has the MR element deposited onto either the {0001} or the {1120} plane with the {1100} plane being oriented as the wear surface. The closure piece has either the {1120} or the {0001} plane facing the MR material and the {1100} plane oriented as the wear surface.

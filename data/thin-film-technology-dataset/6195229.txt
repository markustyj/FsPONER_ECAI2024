A method of manufacturing a thin film merged magnetic head including an inductive write structure and a magnetoresistive sensor uses a patterned protection layer to protect a second shield/bottom pole layer in regions spaced from the pole tip of the inductive write structure. A window is provided in the protection layer. During manufacture, the configuration comprises a first shield layer, a magnetoresistive element, a second shield layer serving as a bottom pole, a protection layer, a protection window, a write gap, a top pole, and a pole tip structure. The use of a protection layer and window results in the formation of channels in the second shield layer adjacent to a pedestal that supports the inductive write structure. The channels prevent magnetic flux from extending toward the second shield layer beyond the width of the pole tip structure. This structure reduces side writing with a consequent improvement in off-track performance. The width of the second shield layer allows the magnetoresistive element to be shielded.

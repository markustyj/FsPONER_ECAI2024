A thin film magnetic head is provided in which a magnetic yoke assembly is built up, layer by layer, atop a substrate using semiconductor thin film techniques. A lower yoke assembly is first fabricated including a lower magnetic layer situated on the substrate and first and second side poles built up vertically from the ends of the lower magnetic layer. An insulative pedestal surrounded by a frame is formed at the top of the lower yoke assembly and extends above the uppermost lateral plane of the yoke assembly. A diamond-like carbon (DLC) wear layer is deposited atop the pedestal. First and second pole support wells are excavated in the DLC layer so as to expose the first and second side poles therebelow, and further to receive first and second pole supports, respectively, therein. First and second pole extension members are situated on the first and second pole support members, respectively, with a non-magnetic gap region being situated between the first and second pole extension members. A second DLC layer is situated in the same plane as the non-magnetic gap region and the first and second pole extension members. The second DLC layer substantially surrounds the first and second side pole extensions and the gap region. In this manner, the gap region is elevated above the plane of the first and second pole support members and is protected from undesired head wear.

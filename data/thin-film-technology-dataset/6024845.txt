The invention provides a method of forming a thin film recording head including an upper magnetic substance, a lower magnetic substance cooperating with the upper magnetic substance to form a magnetic circuit, at least one coil layer interposed between the upper and lower magnetic substances, the coil layer being configured in a coil pattern, and an insulative layer interposed between the upper and lower magnetic substances and surrounding the coil pattern. The insulative layer is composed of hard-cured photoresist. A peak intensity ratio of a surface portion of the insulative layer is equal to or less than 0.5 relative to a peak intensity of aromatic C.dbd.C bonding, which aromatic is a main constituent of the photoresist. The peak intensity ratio represents an amount of hydrophilic radical. The invention suppresses the hydrophilic property of a hard-cured photoresist layer to thereby provide an advantage of enhancement of electrical insulation and reduction of noises of a thin film head.

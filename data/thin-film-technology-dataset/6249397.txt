A magnetic read-write device with a magnetic head consisting of a core and a coil. The read-write device is incorporated into in a camera. A writing circuit is connected directly and in parallel to the coil, for driving the coil with writing current in a writing mode for writing binary code data on a magnetic recording layer provided on photo film. The writing circuit has a pair of write control switches which are turned ON and OFF alternately to each other, to apply the writing current to the coil in alternating directions. An amplification circuit is also connected directly and in parallel to the coil. The amplification circuit amplifies signal voltage induced between terminals of the coil in a reading mode for reading binary code data from the magnetic recording layer, to output a reproduction signal. A switching transistor is connected in a line through which a drive voltage is supplied to the amplification circuit. In the writing mode, the switching transistor is turned OFF to deactivate the amplification circuit. In the reading mode, the switching transistor is turned ON, and the write control switches are turned OFF.

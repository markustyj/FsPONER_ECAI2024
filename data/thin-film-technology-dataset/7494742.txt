 A system provides an environmental barrier also useful for providing a circuit, for example, one having a thin-film battery such as one that includes lithium or lithium compounds connected to an electronic circuit. An environmental barrier is deposited as alternating layers, at least one of the layers providing a smoothing, planarizing, and/or leveling physical-configuration function, and at least one other layer providing a diffusion-barrier function. The layer providing the physical-configuration function may include a photoresist, a photodefinable, an energy-definable, and/or a maskable layer. The physical-configuration layer may also be a dielectric. A layered structure, including a plurality of pairs of layers, each pair including a physical configuration layer and a barrier layer with low gas-transmission rates, may be used in reducing gas transmission rate to beyond currently detectable levels.

A thin film magnetic head assembly useful for contact recording in a disk drive comprises an air bearing slider formed with only a single air bearing rail. The slider is substantially L-shaped having a leg portion on which a pedestal with an air bearing surface is provided. A wear pad is formed on the pedestal and encompasses the pole tips and transducing gap of the transducer. The wear pad makes contact with the magnetic disk during operation of the disk drive. The small area of the wear pad makes minimal contact with the surface of the magnetic disk so that frictional effects are significantly reduced thereby extending the wear life of the magnetic head. An alternative embodiment of a contact head slider uses a tripad design wherein the front pads fly relative to the disk and the rear pad which supports the transducer is in contact with the rotating disk during operation of a disk drive.

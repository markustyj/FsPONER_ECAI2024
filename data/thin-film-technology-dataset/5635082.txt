A thin film head of the floating type includes a head slider 1 having a surface to be opposed to the signal face of a recording medium with a small space formed therebetween. At least one head element 2 is formed by thin film forming techniques on a face of the head slider 1 orthogonal to the slider surface. A protective layer 3 is formed over the head slider face and covers the head element 2. The head slider 1 has a pair of side faces orthogonal to the slider surface to be opposed to the medium and extending in parallel to each other respectively at opposite sides of the head element 2. The protective layer 3 is formed at each of its opposite side portions with a bulging-out curved face R smoothly extending from the surface of the protective layer 3 to the side face of the head slider 1.

 A method and apparatus for processing sub-micron write head flare definition is provided. The method for processing a perpendicular magnetic head forms a portion of a perpendicular write head, where the portion of the write head includes a first pole layer, a coil layer, a second pole layer and a write pole, the method forms a portion of a magnetic read head adjacent to the portion of the perpendicular write head, where the portion of the read head includes a shield layer and a sensor, the method also laps the write pole concurrently with the sensor to define a flare position of the pole tip and to define a sensor height, where the flare position of the pole tip is defined in the same photo-lithography step as the back edge of the sensor.

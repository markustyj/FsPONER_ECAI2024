In order to prevent generation of Barkhausen noise of a magnetoresistance-effect element, a thin antiferromagnetic film formed of Fe-Mn-X alloy containing a third alloying element X (which serves to improve corrosion resistance of Fe-Mn alloy) by 0.1 to 20 atomic % is disposed in adjacent to a thin permalloy film. The element X is selected from the group consisting of Ir, Ru, Zr, Nb, Si, Ge, V, Co, Pt and Pd. It is particularly recommended to employ Ir of 4 to 15 atomic % or Ru of 5.5 to 15 atomic % as the element X. When one or more alloying element selected from Ru, Rh, Pt, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Ni, Cu, Al, Si and Ge is added to Fe and Mn which are essential components of the Fe-Mn-X alloy in addition to the element X, corrosion resistance of the alloy is improved more sufficiently.

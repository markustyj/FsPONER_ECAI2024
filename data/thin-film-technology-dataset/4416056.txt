A process for the preparation of film coils is disclosed, which comprises forming a first plane coil layer by arranging a plurality of insulated spiral conductor patterns wound in the same direction adjacent to one another without any gaps, laminating on the first plane coil layer a second plane coil layer formed by arranging a similar plurality of spiral conductor patterns wound in the reverse direction, and connecting the conductor patterns in the first plane coil layer to the conductor patterns in the second plane coil alternately through windows in the insulation separating the plane coil layers to form one coil. The flatness of the resulting structure allows plane coil layers to be laminated to form a stack. The resulting coils may be employed to produce a multi-track recording head with minimal distance between the heads, transformers, and other inductors, including center-tapped inductors.

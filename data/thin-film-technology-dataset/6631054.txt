A second magnetic film of an inductive type electromagnetic conversion element is positioned at a trailing edge side relative to a first magnetic film of the conversion element. One edge portion of the second magnetic film is opposed to one edge portion of the first magnetic film by a given distance. The one edge portion of the second magnetic film has at least one side surface inclined at a given inclination angle not less than a maximum skew angle. The second magnetic film is extended backward, and joined with the first magnetic film. A coil film of the inductive type electromagnetic conversion element is whirled around the magnetic circuit composed of the first and second magnetic films.

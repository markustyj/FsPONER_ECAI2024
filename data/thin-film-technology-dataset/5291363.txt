A magnetic head (1) for reading information comprises a magnetoresistive element (21) which is arranged between two flux guides (7, 9) present on a support and is partly located on thinner ends (25, 27) of the flux guides. The flux guides are composed of a basic layer (13, 15) and a main layer (17, 19) which partly covers the basic layer. Subsequently the magnetoresistive element is partly provided on the parts (25, 27) of the basic layer which have been left free by the main layer so that the magnetoresistive element is magnetically coupled to the flux guides via coupling parts (20, 22).

A thin film magnetic head comprises a magnetic gap spacer layer interposed between two soft magnetic members at least one of which is formed in a thin film form. The magnetic gap spacer layer is made of a thermally decomposed polymer of a metallic compound represented by the formula, M(OR1)m(R2)n-m, where M is a metallic element selected from metals and metalloids which are elements intermediate in properties between the typical metals and non-metals, R1 being one selected from hydrogen and an alkyle group, R2 being an alkyle group, n being a valence of the metallic element, and m being an integer equal to or less than n. Typical ones of the metallic compound are tetraisopropyl titanate, tetranormalbutyl titanate, tetraalkoxysilane, organosilanol, and aluminum isopropylate. The metallic compound is solved in an organic solvent and is coated on a surface to be formed with the magnetic gap spacer. The coating is heat-treated at a lower temperature to thereby form the polymer. The polymer serves as an adhesive layer for adhering the two magnetic members.

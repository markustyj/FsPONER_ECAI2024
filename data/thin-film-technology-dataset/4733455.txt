A magnetic head using an MR element and a permanent magnet for applying a bias magnetic field to the MR element, and a lead frame of the head. A sheet of metal is punched or otherwise shaped in a predetermined pattern to produce the lead frame. The lead frame includes sections mounting the MR element and permanent magnet, lead connecting sections electrically connected to connecting sections of the MR element, and tape-contact sections which are flush with a tape-contact surface of the MR element. The lead frame mounted with the MR element and permanent magnet and provided with the lead connecting sections is placed in a metal mold having a predetermined configuration and buried and fixed in place in synthetic resin.

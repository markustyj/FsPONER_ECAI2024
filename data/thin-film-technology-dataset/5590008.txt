A magnetic disc unit has a thin film magnetic head in which a lower magnetic core and an upper magnetic core form a magnetic circuit. The upper magnetic core is constructed by magnetic films having at least two layers. A saturation magnetic flux density of the inside magnetic film, of the magnetic films having at least two layers, facing a magnetic gap of the magnetic circuit is larger than that of the outside magnetic films of the upper magnetic core and the lower magnetic core.

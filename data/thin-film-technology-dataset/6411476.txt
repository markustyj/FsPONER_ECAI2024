A trilayer seed layer structure is employed between a first read gap layer and a spin valve sensor for improving the magnetic and giant magnetoresistive properties and the thermal stability. In the spin valve sensor, the trilayer seed layer structure is located between a first read gap layer and a ferromagnetic free layer. The antiferromagnetic pinning layer is preferably nickel manganese (Ni--Mn). The trilayer seed layer structure includes a first seed layer that is a first metallic oxide, a second seed layer that is a second metallic oxide and a third seed layer that is a nonmagnetic metal. A preferred embodiment is a first seed layer of nickel oxide (NiO), a second seed layer of nickel manganese oxide (NiMnO.sub.x), and a third seed layer of copper (Cu).

A composite thin film slider with a protruding R/W device formed by chemical-mechanical polishing to protrude above its substrate and thereby reduce the distance between the R/W device and the recording media. The slider includes a ceramic or non-ceramic substrate with a substantially planar bearing surface, and a R/W device. The R/W device includes an insulator and certain conductive R/W components, deposited onto the substrate's deposit end. The R/W components may include, for example, a magnetic shield layer, a MR stripe layer, and a magnetic pole tip layer, all layered over the deposit end of the substrate. The R/W components protrude from the insulator sufficiently to extend past the substrate's bearing surface. To manufacture this slider, a substrate with the R/W device deposited thereon is polished with a lapping slurry to disproportionately erode the substrate and insulator with respect to the R/W components. The R/W components therefore protrude from the insulator and the ceramic substrate's bearing surface.

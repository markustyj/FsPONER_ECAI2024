 A thin film magnetic head includes a magnetoresistive element having a recording-medium-facing-surface which is to be faced with a magnetic recording medium; a magnetic bias layer located on a side opposite to the recording-medium-facing-surface of the magnetoresistive element, and applying a bias magnetic field to the magnetoresistive element in a direction orthogonal to the recording-medium-facing-surface; and a resistive film pattern having the recording-medium-facing-surface, the resistive film pattern being located side by side with the magnetoresistive element in a track-width direction.

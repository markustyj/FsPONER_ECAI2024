 A magnetic head for a hard disk drive having a CPP read head sensor that includes a layered sensor stack including a free magnetic layer and hard bias elements that are disposed on the sides of the free magnetic layer to provide a biasing magnetization for the free magnetic layer. To increase the coercivity of the hard bias elements, and thereby improve the biasing of the magnetization of the free magnetic layer, the ratio (t/H) of the thickness t to the height H of the hard bias elements is fabricated to be within the range of from approximately 1 to approximately 1/15.

A process for making thin film magnetic heads includes forming a precisely defined back gap opening used for magnetic closure of the P1 and P1 pole pieces. A mushroom-like photoresist structure having a cap layer supported by a stem layer is formed over the P1 pole piece by a double resist spin and double exposure method with a critical baking step to harden previously deposited photoresist layers between the first exposure and the second photoresist spin. The cap layer defines the back gap opening. When the mushroom-like photoresist structure is removed by a single step lift-off with a solvent, the back gap opening is formed.

The electrical insulation performance between a lower shield layer and a main electrode layer is improved in a magnetoresistive head using a magnetoresistive element. A lower gap layer made of alumina is formed on the surface of the lower shield layer, and an MR element, a longitudinal bias layer, and an upper gap layer are formed thereon. In a portion facing a magnetic medium, the MR element, the longitudinal bias layer, and the gap layers appear between the lower shield layer and the upper shield layer, and the gap length GL is determined by the lower gap layer and the upper gap layer. In the portion other than the portion facing the magnetic medium, the lower gap layer and the upper gap layer are interposed between the main electrode layer and the lower shield layer, and the main electrode layer is connected to the longitudinal bias layer through the upper gap layer. The two gap layers are interposed between the main electrode layer and the lower shield layer, and the electrical insulation performance between the main electrode layer and the lower shield layer is improved.

This invention provides a thin film magnetic head composed of at least one conductive body layer formed in a magnetic material substrate with grooves therein, each groove being filled with a non-magnetic material, an insulating layer formed on the face of the magnetic material substrate including the conductive body layers, and a magnetic material layer formed on the insulating body layer. To precisely form the groove, an electrolytic etching process of the substrate and an annealing process of the substrate surface layer are combined to provide an straight-line property of the groove and the groove section, circular in arc, with better reproducibility.

 A write driver circuit includes a first write driver that communicates with a first node of a write head. A first feedback path communicates with a control input and an output of the first write driver. The first feedback path includes a first resistance connected between the output of the first write driver and the control input of the first write driver. A second write driver communicates with a second node of the write head. A second feedback path communicates with a control input and an output of the second write driver. The second feedback path includes a second resistance connected between the output of the second write driver and the control input of the second write driver.

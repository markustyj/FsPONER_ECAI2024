A thin-film magnetic head constructed by depositing a conductor layer formed in a spiral pattern having two or more turns on a magnetic substrate. A non-magnetic insulating layer is then formed to fill the spaces between turns of the conductive layer in such a manner that the thickness of the non-magnetic layer is substantially the same as that of the conductor layer. A further non-magnetic insulating layer and a magnetic layer are formed successively on the non-magnetic layer. A gap is formed on one side of the lamination between the magnetic layer and the magnetic substrate interposing the further non-magnetic insulating layer. A magnetic circuit through the magnetic layer and the magnetic substrate around the conductive layer includes therein the gap.

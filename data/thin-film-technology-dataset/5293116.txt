At the wafer level, a conventional write signal is applied to a pre-selected thin film head. Thereafter, first and second constant amplitude, differing frequency sine wave signals are applied to the head along with a DC bias signal whose magnitude is varied. The level of frequency mixing in the output signal of the head is detected at each level of magnitude of the DC bias signal and this data is utilized in predicting the level of noise in the read-back signal of the thin film head during normal read and write operations in connection with a rotating storage disk.

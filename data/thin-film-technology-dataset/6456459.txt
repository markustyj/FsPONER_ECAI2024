A thin-film magnetic head and a method of manufacturing the same of the invention achieve precise control of a magnetic pole width with and a sufficient overwrite property even when the pole width is reduced and achieve precise control of a throat height. In the thin-film magnetic head of the invention, a pole portion of a bottom pole layer and an insulating layer are formed on a yoke portion of the bottom pole layer. The throat height is defined by the interface between the pole portion and the insulating layer. The pole portion and the insulating layer form a flat surface on a side of a recording gap layer. A top pole layer includes: a pole portion having a width that defines a recording track width; and a yoke portion having a width greater than that of the pole portion and magnetically coupled to the pole portion. The interface between the pole portion and the yoke portion is located on the flat recording gap layer.

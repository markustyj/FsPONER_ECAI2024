A thin film magnetic head for use with a magnetic recording medium having a direction of movement, includes a substrate and a plurality of magnetic read/write cores disposed on the substrate. At least a part of each core is formed of a magnetic thin film deposited on the substrate. Each of the cores includes a magnetic gap disposed between the magnetic read/write core and the substrate, the magnetic gaps being aligned with each other in the same position relative to the direction of movement of the magnetic recording medium. Each magnetic gap is separated an identical distance from the substrate, and each of the cores has a different width for forming a different width track on the magnetic recording medium.

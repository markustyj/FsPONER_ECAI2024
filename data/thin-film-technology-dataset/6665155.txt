A free layer structure of a spin valve sensor includes a cobalt niobium or cobalt niobium hafnium layer for providing a negative magnetostriction which completely or partially counterbalances a positive magnetostriction of a cobalt or cobalt iron layer wherein the cobalt or cobalt iron layer interfaces a copper spacer layer for increasing the magnetoresistive coefficient dr/R of the head. In one aspect of the invention the free layer structure consists of only the cobalt iron layer and the cobalt niobium or cobalt niobium hafnium layer.

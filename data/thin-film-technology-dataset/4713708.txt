A magnetoresistive (MR) read transducer assembly in which the thin film MR layer is longitudinally biased only in the end regions by exchange bias developed by a thin film of antiferromagnetic material that is deposited in direct contact only in the end regions of the MR layer and a thin film of soft magnetic material which extends across the transducer assembly. The longitudinal bias is developed by exchange coupling between the thin film of antiferromagnetic material and both the MR layer and the thin film of soft magnetic material in the end regions. However, the thin film of soft magnetic material is separated from the MR layer in the central region only of the MR layer by a decoupling layer which interrupts the exchange coupling so that transverse bias is produced only in the central region upon connection of a bias source to conductor leads which are connected to the MR layer within the end region. The transverse bias is produced in that part of the central region of the MR layer in which the bias current and the decoupling layer are both present. Upon connection of a signal sensing means to the conductor leads, an output signal is sensed which detects resistance changes in the MR layer as a function of the fields which are intercepted by the MR layer.

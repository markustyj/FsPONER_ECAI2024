A magnetic sensor (1) includes a magneto-resistive element (3) which magnetically bridges a gap (15) between two magnetic flux conductors (6,7). In order to reduce the noise level and higher harmonic distortion of the sensor, each of the flux conductors (6,7) includes at least two layers (16,18) of magnetically permeable materials having substantially the same composition between which a layer (17) is present which has a different composition.

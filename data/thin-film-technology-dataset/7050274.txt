 Multilayer permanent magnet films comprising at least two permanent magnet layers separated by an interlayer are disclosed. In one embodiment, the multilayer permanent magnet film includes an interlayer deposited on a first permanent magnet layer, a seed layer deposited on the interlayer, and a second permanent magnet layer deposited on the seed layer. The permanent magnet layers may comprise a material such as CoPt, while the seed layer may comprise a material such as TiW. The interlayer may comprise a material such as Ta. The multilayer permanent magnet films possess favorable properties such as high magnetic coercivity (H.sub.c) and high remnant magnetization (M.sub.R) at thicknesses which yield high magnetic fields. The films may be used in applications such as current perpendicular to the plane (CPP) magnetic sensors in which the multilayer permanent magnet film is used to magnetically bias the sensor.

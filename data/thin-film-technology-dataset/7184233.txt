 In one example, a dual source tracking servo system includes a head assembly having a data transducer, a primary position detector for sensing the position of a magnetically stored data track, and a secondary position detector for sensing the position of a fixed reference associated with a magnetic storage medium. A controller is configured for adjusting the position of the head assembly in response to a weighted average of the sensed position of the magnetically stored data track and the fixed reference, wherein the position of the magnetically stored data track is weighted more than the position of the fixed reference. The primary position detector may include one or more dedicated servo read elements associated with the head assembly and the secondary position detector may include a magnetic or optical sensor. The fixed reference may include a tape edge or servo track.

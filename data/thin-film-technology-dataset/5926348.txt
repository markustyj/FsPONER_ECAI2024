A magneto-resistance type magnetic head having: a base; a longitudinal bias portion, formed over the base and having a first upper flat surface and a first slanted portion, for generating a longitudinal bias magnetic field; a lead portion laminated directly on the longitudinal bias portion so as to cover the first upper flat portion and to expose the first slanted portion of the longitudinal bias portion, wherein the lead portion is made of non-magnetic material and has a second upper flat surface and a second slanted portion, and wherein the first and second slanted portions collectively serve as a slanted surface; and a magneto-resistance material layer formed over the longitudinal bias portion and the lead portion, wherein the magneto-resistance material layer directly contacts an upper surface of the base and magnetically couples with the exposed longitudinal bias portion through the slanted surface of the longitudinal bias portion, wherein the magneto-resistance material layer is terminated on the slanted surface.

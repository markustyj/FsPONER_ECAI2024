 A write driver circuit for a magnetic storage medium that communicates with a write head having first and second nodes comprises a first driver circuit having a first input, a first output that communicates with the first node, and a first feedback path between the first input and the first output. A second driver circuit has a second input, a second output that communicates with the second node, and a second feedback path between the second input and the second output. A first write current circuit selectively drives current through the write head in a first direction. A second write current circuit selectively drives current through the write head in a second direction. A first boost circuit decreases a first transition period between current flowing in the first direction and current flowing in the second direction.

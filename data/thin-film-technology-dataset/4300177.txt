A thin-film magnetic head for writing information in and reading information from a track of a magnetic recording medium in which the head comprises a magnetically permeable yoke having two limbs between which a writing/reading gap is formed. In a construction in which the limbs of the yoke overlap each other at the area of the writing/reading gap, they are bridged by a magneto-resistive reading element at a location remote from the reading/writing gap. A conductor is provided in some forms of the invention which extends intermediate the laterally overlapping limbs. This conductor is utilized for producing a writing flux in the magnetic yoke. Another conductor may be provided which extends through a window or opening in the yoke, which is remote from the reading/writing gap. This other conductor is utilized during writing operation to maximize efficiency.

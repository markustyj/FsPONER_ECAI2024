The magnetic head according to the present invention has a ferrite substrate and closure. The ferrite substrate has formed therein a first recess in which a conductive coil is to be deposited, while the ferrite closure has formed therein a second recess enclosing a portion of the conductive coil that is contributed to at least signal transducing. The end of the second recess is disposed in a position related with the depth of the tranducing gap. Since the first recess in which the conductive coil is deposited has no influence on the magnetic transducing efficiency, it can be much freely formed by photolithography or reactive ion etching. Also since the second recess having an influence on the magnetic transducing efficiency can be formed by precision machining, no advanced process control is needed.

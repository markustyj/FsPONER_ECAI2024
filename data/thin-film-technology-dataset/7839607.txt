 A method is presented for fabricating a CPP read head having a CPP read head sensor and a hard bias layer which includes forming a strip of sensor material in a sensor material region, and depositing strips of fast-milling dielectric material in first and second fast-milling dielectric material regions adjacent to the sensor material region. A protective layer and a layer of masking material are deposited on the strip of sensor material and the strips of fast-milling dielectric material to provide masked areas and exposed areas. A shaping source, such as an ion milling source, is provided which shapes the exposed areas. Hard bias material is then deposited on the regions of sensor material and fast-milling dielectric material to form caps on each of these regions. The caps of hard bias material and the masking material are then removed from each of these regions.

The present invention relates to a method of forming an electrode for a thin film transistor, which forms an electrode of a double-layered structure consisting of first and second metal layers by carrying out two steps of etching the metal layers by means of varying the diluted density of an etching solution, preventing hillock and junction spiking as well as controlling the generation of undercutting. The method includes the steps of forming a first and second metal layer on a substrate successively, forming a photoresist pattern on a predetermined portion of the second metal layer, etching the second metal layer to expose the first metal layer with a dense mixed solution of (H.sub.3 PO.sub.4 O+HNO.sub.3 +CH.sub.3 COOH+H.sub.2 O), using the photoresist pattern as an etch mask, etching the exposed first metal layer with a diluted mixed solution of (H.sub.3 PO.sub.4 O+HNO.sub.3 +CH.sub.3 COOH+H.sub.2 O), using the photoresist pattern as an etch mask, and removing the photoresist pattern.

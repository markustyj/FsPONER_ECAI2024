This thin film inductive transducer comprises a yoke structure consisting of a pole tip region which joins a back region. To maximize resolution during reading of magnetic transitions from a moving magnetic recording medium, the pole tip region is of preselected constant relatively narrow width, and composed of magnetic layers having edges which extend in a direction normal to the medium for a distance D from an air bearing surface ABS to the back region and having a small thickness at least adjacent the ABS. To minimize the effects of spurious signals from adjacent tracks on the medium, distance D is at least 5/d, where d is the recording density on the medium; however, to maximize transducer efficiency, distance D is not increased significantly above 5/d. To oppose saturation of the yoke structure with applied current and enhance the efficiency of the transducer during recording, the cross-sectional area of the yoke structure is increased in the back region by progressively increasing its width rearward of the pole tip region and concurrently increasing the thickness of said magnetic layers at least about 60%.

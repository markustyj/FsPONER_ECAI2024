The disclosed static reading head includes a dense network of micro-heads. Each of these micro-heads has a magnetic circuit body made of ferrite, closed by the tape to be read through narrow Permalloy pieces. The micro-heads are associated with lines of excitation wires supplied with DC current with a high-frequency component, and columns of reading wires connected to detection circuits.

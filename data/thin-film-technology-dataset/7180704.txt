 A magnetic head is composed to diminish disordered writing bits of a recording layer or reading noise caused by a magnetic field generated from an under layer without decreasing a writing magnetic field strength of the magnetic head. The magnetic head includes a write head provided with a main pole and one or more auxiliary poles, a read head provided with a read element, and coils located on both sides of the main pole in a manner to sandwich the main pole. The coil located on one side generates the asymmetrical magneto-motive force for magnetizing the main pole to that generated by the coil located on the other side.

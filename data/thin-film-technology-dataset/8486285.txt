 A method for forming a write pole comprises forming a stop layer over a substrate layer of a wafer, the stop layer having an opening above a damascene trench in the substrate layer, and forming a buffer layer over the stop layer, the buffer layer having an opening above the opening of the stop layer. The method further comprises plating a layer of magnetic material over the wafer, disposing a first sacrificial material over a region of the magnetic material above the damascene trench, performing a milling or etching operation over the wafer to remove the magnetic material not covered by the first sacrificial material and to remove the first sacrificial material, disposing a second sacrificial material over the wafer, and performing a polishing operation over the wafer to remove the region of the magnetic material above the damascene trench, the second sacrificial material, and the buffer layer.

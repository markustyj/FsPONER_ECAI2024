A magnetic thin film head for writing and reading comprising a stratified build-up on a nonmagnetic substrate for a recording medium that can be magnetized vertically, comprises a ring head-like conducting body for carrying the magnetic flux having two magnet legs, of which the poles facing the recording medium are arranged one behind the other as seen in the direction of motion of the head, and having a predetermined spacing from each other and which delineate a space in between, through which the turns of an at least largely flat coil winding extend. This magnetic head makes possible, with a relatively simple design, a switchable write and read function with high efficiency and in particular produces a large read voltage. The conducting body carrying the magnetic flux further comprises an additional leg part extending over the region of the head part, and, in addition to the flat coil winding serving only for providing a read function, an additional coil winding is provided only for providing a write function, the turns of which are associated only with the additional leg part.

A magnetoresistive head structure that incorporates a thin film magnetoresistive transducer that is suitable for use in perpendicular and longitudinal recording heads. This structure includes first and second dielectrically separated magnetoresistive members that have noncontacting first ends. Sense conductors are disposed in contact with the first ends of the magnetoresistive members and are adapted to provide sense currents thereto. A bias current conductor arrangement is disposed adjacent to the magnetoresistive members and is separated therefrom by dielectric and is adapted to provide bias current thereto. A common conductor is disposed in contact with the second ends of the magnetoresistive members and is adapted to short the second ends thereof and provide a return path for the sense and bias currents. In one embodiment, the bias conductor arrangement passes between the magnetoresistive members and thus provides for longitudinal transition detection. In another embodiment, the bias conductor arrangement passes adjacent one side of the first magnetoresistive member and returns on the other side of the two magnetoresistive elements and thus provides for perpendicular transition detection. Additionally, a plurality of nonmagnetic shield members may be provided adjacent the magnetoresistive members to magnetically shield them from extraneous magnetic fields and improve resolution. Differential amplification means may also be provided for processing voltages sensed across the magnetoresistive members.

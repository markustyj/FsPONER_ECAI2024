A magnetic disk system comprises a magnetic head for writing data on and reading data from a magnetic disk as a recording medium and a magnetic disk unit having a head positioning mechanism for positioning the magnetic head on a selected track of the magnetic disk without forming servo information on the magnetic disk. The magnetic head comprises an MR film which is disposed parallel to the direction of the width of a track of the magnetic disk, current supplying electrodes disposed to be in contact with both ends of the magnetic film which are opposed in the direction of the track width and a signal detecting electrode disposed between the current supplying electrodes to be in contact with the MR film. The width of the signal detecting electrode is less than 1/3 of that of the current supplying electrodes. The magnetic disk system permits highly accurate alignment of the magnetic head with closely spaced tracks.

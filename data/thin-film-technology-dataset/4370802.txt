A method of making a thin film magnetic head assembly having a substrate, superstrate and thin film magnetic transducer mounted therebetween wherein the thin film magnetic transducer includes conductive leads located interior to and extending between the substrate and superstrate comprising the steps of mounting a thin film transducer on the substrate with the transducing portion thereof located adjacent one edge of the substrate, positioning a preformed planar conductive connecting member formed of an elongated support section and a plurality of spaced, aligned connecting elements having a relatively thin coating of diffusable conductive metal coating located on one side positioned in intimate contact with the conductive leads with the connecting elements and the elongated support section extending passed the substrate, placing a superstrate in alignment with the substrate, thin film magnetic transducer and planar conductive connecting member with the surface thereof in intimate engagement with the connecting elements to form a sub-assembly thereof having a predetermined space which has a dimension equal to the sum of the thickness of one of the conductive leads, the planar conductive connecting member and the thickness of the diffusable conductive metal coating thereon, placing a quantity of insulating material adjacent the spaced opposed edges and in the vicinity of the transducing portion of the thin film magnetic transducer, heating the sub-assembly, urging the superstrate and the substrate together with a clamping force enabling the diffusable conductive metal coating to diffuse into both the conductive leads and connecting elements.

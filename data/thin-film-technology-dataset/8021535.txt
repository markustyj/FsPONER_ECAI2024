 Methods and structures for electroplating shield structures for perpendicular thin film write poles having ultra thin non-magnetic top gaps on the order of a few nanometers are disclosed. Ultra thin, conductive seed layers serve a dual purpose as both plating seed layer and non-magnetic top gap for the write pole. Due to reduced current carrying capacity of ultra thin seed layers, an additional thick seed layer is also employed to aid delivering plating current to regions near the pole.

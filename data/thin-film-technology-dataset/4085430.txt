A thin-film magnetic head having improved playback properties in which the gap-bounding core parts overlap each other laterally while enclosing a layer having a gap and in which a first core part has the shape of a closed loop and is bridged in the center by a second core part. The parts of the first core part on either side of the bridge are provided with identical coils, while the first core part at the area of the overlap is divided centrally by an extra gap. Upon playing back, the difference signals of the coils then provides an indication as regards the position relative to the track.

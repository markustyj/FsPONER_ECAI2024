A transducer for a hard disk drive system has a planar magnetic core and a pair of poletips that project transversely from the core for sliding contact with the disk during reading and writing. The transducer is formed entirely of thin films in the shape of a low profile table having three legs that slide on the disk, the poletips being exposed at a bottom of one of the legs for high resolution communication with the disk, the throat height of the poletips affording sufficient tolerance to allow for wear. The legs elevate the transducer from the disk sufficiently to minimize lifting by a thin air layer that moves with the spinning disk which, in combination with the small size of the thin film head allows a low load and a flexible beam and gimbal to hold the transducer to the disk. The transducer includes a loop shaped core of magnetic material that ends at the poletips, the core extending further parallel than perpendicular to the disk surface and preferably being formed of a plurality of slightly spaced ribbons of magnetic material in order to increase high frequency permeance. A high magnetic saturation layer may be formed adjoining the gap in at least the trailing poletip, in order to avoid saturation at the poletips during writing. The dimensions of the yoke adjacent to the poletips are also designed to avoid saturation at the poletips by saturating at a lower flux in the yoke than the poletips. The close relationship between the transducer and the media of the disk affords high density magnetic data storage and retrieval.

 A recording head comprises a first tape-head contact area including a first write element and a first read element, which itself may include an MR sensor element. The first read element is laterally offset as to the first write element, and no portion of the first read element lies in a region laterally overlapped by the first write element. A second tape-head contact area includes a second write element and a second read element, which also may include an MR sensor element. The second read element is laterally offset as to the second write element, and no portion of the second read element lies in a region laterally overlapped by the second write element. The first read and write elements of the first tape-head contact area are aligned with the second write and read elements of the second tape-head contact area so that an end portion of the second write element lies in a region that laterally overlaps only an end portion of the first write element. Data track widths less than one micron are achievable with this head design.

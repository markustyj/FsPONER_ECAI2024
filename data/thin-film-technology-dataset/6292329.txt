A thin-film single magnetic pole head which assures highly efficient magnetic energization of a main magnetic pole and which exhibits optimum recording characteristics even in case of recording on a double-layer perpendicular magnetic recording medium with a high frequency. The thin-film single magnetic pole head includes a main magnetic pole consisting of a soft magnetic thin film and a return yoke. A thin-film coil for energizing the main magnetic pole is constituted by a plurality of conductor layers extending substantially parallel to one another and substantially at right angles to the main magnetic pole. The conductor layers are layered together in the up-and-down direction on both sides of the main magnetic pole. A thin-film coil for magnetically energizing the main magnetic pole is constituted by selectively interconnecting the conductors. In this manner, the thin-film coil can be arranged at the foremost part of the main magnetic pole (towards the perpendicular magnetic recording medium facing surface) to render it possible to energize the foremost part of the main magnetic pole with high efficiency.

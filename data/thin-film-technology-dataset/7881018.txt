 A differential giant magnetoresistive sensor for sensing a magnetic signal. The differential sensor has a structure configured to minimize spin torque noise. The differential magnetoresistive sensor includes first and second magnetoresistive sensor elements and a three lead structure including an inner lead sandwiched between the first and second sensor elements and first and second outer leads. each of the sensor elements includes an antiparallel coupled free layer structure with the free layer of each of the sensor elements preferably being positioned near the inner lead. The three lead structure allows sense current to be supplied to the sensor such that electrons travel first through the free layer of each sensor element and then through the pinned layer structure.

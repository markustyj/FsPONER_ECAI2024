 A magnetic head part is constituted by a reproducing head part having a GMR device and a recording head part acting as an inductive electromagnetic transducer which are laminated on a support. The magnetic head part further comprises a heater. One of poles of the heater is electrically connected to a heater electrode pad disposed on a first surface of a head slider. The other pole is electrically connected to a substrate constituting the support, and is energized by way of a second surface of the head slider.

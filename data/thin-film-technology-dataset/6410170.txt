A preferred method of the present invention provides an improved thin film for carrying magnetic flux. With the preferred method, the magnetic thin film may be formed by depositing Fe by reactive sputtering using N.sub.2 to form a thin film comprising .alpha.-Fe and .gamma.-Fe.sub.4 N. With this method, the relative percentage of .gamma.-Fe.sub.4 N in the deposited film is increased to provide expanding lattice constants for both the .alpha.-Fe and the .gamma.-Fe.sub.4 N. Increasing .gamma.-Fe.sub.4 N increases resistivity while expanding lattice constants to provide improved coercivity at higher resistivity. Increasing the percentage of .gamma.-Fe.sub.4 N to provide expanding lattice constants for both the .alpha.-Fe and the .gamma.-Fe.sub.4 N may be accomplished by adjusting sputtering power, N.sub.2 gas percentage, a flow rate of N.sub.2, and substrate bias. In some embodiments, high sputtering power of about 3-4 kW with about 15-30 percent of N.sub.2 may be used to sputter FeX, where X is selected from the group consisting of Rh, Ta, Hf, Al, Zr, Ti, Ru, Si, Cr, V, Si, Sr, Nb, Mo, Ru, and Pd, to provide expanding .alpha.-Fe and .gamma.-Fe.sub.2 N lattice constants. In some embodiments, FeXN films having resistivity values greater than about 50 .mu..OMEGA.cm, 80 .mu..OMEGA.cm, 100 .mu..OMEGA.cm, 115 .mu..OMEGA.cm, or more, for coercivity values less than about 10 Oe, 5 Oe, or 3 Oe are possible, for values of B.sub.s greater than around 12 kG to 17 kG. Embodiments may be used for pole or shield structures in magnetic heads for data storage and retrieval apparatuses to improve high frequency performance.

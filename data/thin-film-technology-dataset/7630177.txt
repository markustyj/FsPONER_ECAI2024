 In a tunnel magnetoresistive (TMR) device, free sublayers are separated by an intermediate spacer layer that serves to ensure a uniform circumferential magnetization in the free stack, counterbalancing orange-peel coupling by antiferromagnetic exchange coupling. Thus, a CPP MR device may have a seed stack, a pinned stack on the seed stack, and a tunnel barrier on the pinned stack. A free stack can be on the tunnel barrier, and the free stack can include structure for promoting uniform circumferential magnetization in the free stack.

Disclosed is a merged thin film magnetic head having a first shield layer and a combined second shield and bottom pole piece layer arranged in a sandwich supporting a read sensor therebetween at the pole tip region. The combined second shield and bottom pole piece layer are magnetically coupled with the first shield layer at the pole tip end of the yoke region adjacent the read sensor, and overlaying and magnetically coupled with the first shield layer at the back gap region. A patterned opening is provided in the combined second shield and bottom pole piece layer at the yoke region thereof to expose the first shield layer and form a flat planarization surface thereon. A plurality of stacked thin film coil layers are provided in the patterned opening, and a top pole piece layer overlies the thin film coil at the yoke region, overlies the bottom pole piece at the pole tip region providing a pole tip and gap thereat, and overlies the bottom pole piece at the back gap region. The patterned opening which exposes the first shield layer allows the provision of a multi-layer coil while maintaining a low profile of the head.

 Test methods and components are disclosed for testing resistances of helical coils formed in magnetic recording heads. Helical coils in magnetic recording heads include a bottom coil structure, a top coil structure, and connecting structures that electrically connect the top and bottom coil structures. A test component is fabricated on the wafer along with the magnetic recording heads. The test component includes a bottom coil structure connected in series, and includes a top coil structure connected in series which is electrically disconnected from the bottom coil structure. Resistances of the top and bottom coil structures are measured in the test component. A total resistance of a helical coil is also measured. The resistance of the connecting structures in the helical coil may then be determined based on the resistance of the bottom coil structure, the resistance of the top coil structure, and the total resistance of the helical coil.

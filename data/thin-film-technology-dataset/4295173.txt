A thin film inductive transducer head includes a magnetic circuit with a pair of legs and inductive coils. The legs are thinner near the pole tip than in the back gap region. The legs are also narrower in the pole tip region than in the back gap region. Resolution is enhanced by the thin pole tips and saturation of the yoke structure is avoided by increasing the cross-sectional area of the yoke structure away from the pole tip region.

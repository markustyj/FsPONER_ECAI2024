The invention relates to a dual magnetoresistive head (DMR) having a narrow track-width, defined as equal to or less than 10 times the height of its MR elements, for use in reproducing signals having short wavelengths greater than 100 kiloflux changes per inch. The track width reduction to less than 10 times the MR element height introduces new parameters into the determination of the DMR signal response. In particular, the directional sense of the magnetization vectors along the longitudinal axes of the two MR elements join with the transverse bias field direction and the signal field direction in determining the head response; that is, the head's performance is now determined by its "three dimensional" characteristics, rather than the "two dimensional" characteristics as in the prior art. In the "symmetric" DMR, the longitudinal bias component in each of the DMR's magnetoresistive elements are parallel and oriented in the same direction, while in the "anti-symmetric" DMR the longitudinal bias components are parallel but are oriented in opposite directions. The symmetric DMR has an off- track response which allows it to possibly serve simultaneously as a tracking head as well as a data reproduce head, while the anti-symmetric DMR has a data signal output that can be more than twice that of the symmetric DMR.

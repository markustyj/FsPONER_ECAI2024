 This invention relates to a multi-layer lithographically fabricated device used to produce improved thin-film recording heads. It further relates to a focused particle beam system for milling a recording head pole-tip assembly without irradiating a sensitive structure, e.g. a read head, of the recording head. The invention precisely forms a pole-tip assembly by milling a second structural element without irradiating a first structural element. The invention avoids irradiating the first structural element by placing a first marker element, which can be imaged and/or damaged, in the same layer of a multi-layer lithographically fabricated device as the first structural element. The marker element has a fixed spatial relationship to the first structural element. Thus, by imaging the first marker element and the second structural element, and knowing the separation between the first structural element and the first marker element, a focused particle beam system can determine the relative location of the first and second structural elements. Consequently, the focused particle beam system can determine, without irradiating the sensitive first structural element, which portions of the second structural element require milling. In this manner, the focused particle beam system mills the second structural element to produce a desired pole-tip configuration. By producing a desired pole-tip configuration, these methods and apparatus produce an improved recording head capable of higher storage density than prior art techniques.

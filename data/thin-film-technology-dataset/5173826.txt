A thin film head assembly includes a coil structure having a thin coil layer that extends within and beyond the magnetic yoke area delineated between opposing magnetic pole pieces, and an additional coil layer formed as a step segment adjacent to the thin layer. The additional layer is spaced away from the pole pieces and the magnetic yoke area and provides a thickened coil area which affords a significant reduction in coil resistance.

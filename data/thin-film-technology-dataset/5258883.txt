Thin-film magnetic head comprising a substrate (3), a magnetoresistive element (9) and two magnetically conducting flux guides (5, 7) extending substantially parallel to each other for magnetic cooperation with the magnetoresistive element (9). A non-magnetic read gap (13) adjacent to a head face (1) extends between the flux guides. The first flux guide (5) is built up in layers and comprises a first soft-magnetic layer (5A) opposite the second flux guide (7), a second soft-magnetic layer (5B) and an insulation layer (5C) of a non-magnetic material extending substantially parallel to the substrate and situated between these soft-magnetic layers. Said soft-magnetic layers join in a common end portion (5E) proximate to the head face. The first soft-magnetic layer is an interrupted layer having two spatially separated layer portions (5AA, 5AB), bridged by the magnetoresistive element.

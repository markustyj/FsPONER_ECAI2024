There is provided a method for producing erase bands of varying width between tracks of information on a recording medium. In accordance with the method, a magnetic head having a write gap and trailing pole with non-parallel portions is produced. In the preferred embodiment, the magnetic head combines an inductive write head with a magneto-resistive read head in a single head structure. The inductive head includes a leading write pole and a trailing write pole which are separated by a recording gap. The write gap is formed with a central portion writing data in a desired orientation, positioned between two non-parallel side portions having divergent angles with respect to the central portion. In the recording process, the side portions write transitions on the recording medium which are oblique or angled with respect to the data transitions written on the medium by the central portion. These angled transitions produce erase bands between adjacent tracks of information represented by the data transitions recorded by the central portion of the write gap.The width of the non-parallel side portions is advantageously selected in accordance with the expected servo position error of the drive.

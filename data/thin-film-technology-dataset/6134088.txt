An electromagnetic head for a storage device comprises a magnetic core forming a magnetic circuit, and a magnetoresistive means. The magnetic core is interrupted by an air-gap, thereby separating a first pole and second pole of the magnetic core. The magnetoresistive means is disposed in the region of the air-gap, and is connected to the magnetic core so as to be connected in the magnetic circuit.

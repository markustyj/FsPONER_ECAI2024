A magnetic write head has first and second pole piece layers wherein each pole piece layer is a lamination of alternate ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic metal films. Each nonmagnetic metal film causes an antiferromagnetic coupling between ferromagnetic films adjacent thereto so that the adjacent ferromagnetic films are antiparallel exchange coupled for at least partial flux closure therebetween. This reduces the domain walls within the pole piece layers so that the pole piece layers have a higher frequency response to energization by a write coil.

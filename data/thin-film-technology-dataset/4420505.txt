To provide a thin film magnetic head having good low frequency response, the invention teaches the use of a movable mask technique whereby a first deposited magnetic film is provided with a tapered, or knife-, edge. Gap spacer material is then deposited on the film knife-edge. Thereafter, a second magnetic film is deposited atop the knife-edge, as well as on the same substrate that supports the first magnetic film. What results, therefore, is a slant gap thin film magnetic head having good low frequency response.

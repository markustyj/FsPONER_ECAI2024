 A separate read/write magnetic head of the present invention includes a magnetoresistive head 11 having a magnetoresistive film 25 disposed between a lower shield 23 and an upper shield 28, both of which are formed on a substrate 21, and a pair of electrodes 26 electrically connected to the magnetoresistive film 25; and an inductive magnetic thin film head 12 having a coil 33 between a lower pole piece 31 and an upper pole piece 35, both of which are disposed on the upper shield 28 of the magnetoresistive head 11 with a separation film 29 being sandwiched therebetween, and through a magnetic gap film 32 and an interlayer insulating film 34. Reduced protrusion of the read head element toward the air bearing surface due to heat deformation caused by changes in ambient temperature can be achieved by configuring the lower shield 23 and the upper shield 28 so that the sum of their thicknesses is 0.4 .mu.m or more and less than 3.4 .mu.m.

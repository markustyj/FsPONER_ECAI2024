A thin-film magnetic head includes a substrate having first and second magnetic layers disposed above the substrate and formed as a laminated sequence of magnetic sub-layers. The first and second magnetic layers have corresponding first ends representing a pole tip region of the head, corresponding second ends representing a back gap region of the head, and corresponding intermediate portions representing an intermediate region of the head between the pole tip region and the back gap region. The first and second magnetic layers are joined together in physical contact at the back gap region and are spaced from one another at the pole tip region and at the intermediate region. A nonmagnetic gap layer is disposed between the first and second magnetic layers at the pole tip region. A magnetic coil structure is disposed between the first and second magnetic layers at the intermediate region. The second magnetic layer has a sloped region wherein the second magnetic layer slopes away from the first magnetic layer behind the pole tip region to form a space for the magnetic coil structure. The sloped region of the second magnetic layer may have less magnetic permeability than other portions of the second magnetic layer. A third magnetic layer is thus disposed on the second magnetic layer and extends from the back gap region to cover at least the sloped region of the second magnetic layer.

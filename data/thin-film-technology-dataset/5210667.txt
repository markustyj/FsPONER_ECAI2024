A thin film magnetic head and a method for making the thin film head by the use of electrical lapping guides includes the use of a resistive lapping guide that has a height dimension and an electrical resistance that optimizes the results of the comparison of the resistive lapping guide to a finished lapping guide. The resistive lapping guide is not lapped during the lapping process. The finished lapping guide is lapped and the resistive comparison between the two determines the stopping of the lapping process. An as-lapped guide which is of the same dimensions as the finished lapping guide after lapping can also be included. An interleaved magnetic head having alternating magneto-resistive read elements and inductive write elements can be precisely lapped by sensing the resistance of the lapping guide elements and using a formula to determine the final resistance of the finished lapping guide to halt the lapping process.

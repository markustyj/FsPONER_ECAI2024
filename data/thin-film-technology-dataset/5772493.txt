The invention is directed toward a lapping apparatus and method for accurately obtaining the height of a magnetoresistive (MR) element of a magnetic head during a lapping process. The apparatus includes a source for inducing a magnetic excitation field, and a current source for applying a sense current to a prepatterned photolithographically formed MR element. A sensor monitors the resistance of the MR element in response to variations in the magnetic excitation field, and controls the lapping process in response to the monitored resistance of the MR element. In one embodiment, the MR element includes a GMR formed of a stack of parallel MR layers and operates either in a CPP (Current-Perpendicular-to-the Plane) mode or in a CIP (Current-In-the Plane) mode. In a particular embodiment, the magnetic excitation field is generated by a conductor formed on the magnetic head.

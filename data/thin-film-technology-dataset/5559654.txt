Process for fabricating a thin film head for high track density recording defines an easy axis parallel to the track in the narrow poletip without a need of a very high magnetic field in the plating cell. Narrow poletips of equal widths of P1 and P2 are obtained. The process includes sheet depositing a magnetic layer, then depositing a sheet of gap material, and then depositing a sheet of another magnetic layer. This operation can be done either by a vacuum technique or by an electroplating process. If it is done by vacuum processing, all the three depositions can be done in one pumpdown. Since the sheet magnetic films are deposited, the demagnetizing field is very small, and a small orienting field is necessary unlike the large field required in the prior art.

A magnetoresistance effect type thin film head (A) constructed in a manner that a magnetoresistance effect element, that is, an MR element (1) is disposed perpendicularly to a head surface a, and among two electrodes (2a) and (2b) led out from both ends of the MR element (1), the one electrode (2a) is exposed to the head surface a but the other electrode (2b) is not exposed to the head surface a, wherein the one electrode (2a) exposed to the head surface a is connected to a ground voltage Vss, thereby decreasing the change in voltage difference between the electrode (2a) of the MR element (1) and a disc surface b to prevent the electrical breakdown of the thin film head (A).

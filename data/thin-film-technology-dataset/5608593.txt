A magnetoresistive transducer and method for manufacturing the same includes a spin valve structure comprising a pinned, bottom ferromagnetic layer and an active, top ferromagnetic layer separated by a thin nonmagnetic metal spacer layer. The active ferromagnetic layer and underlying spacer layer are formed into a mesa structure having tapered opposing sides to promote better surface planarization in a thin film fabrication process. A pair of permanent magnet layer portions may be deposited at the end portions of the spin valve structure in a generally coplanar relationship to promote domain stabilization but may also be separated therefrom by a relatively thin separation layer. The magnetic read track width of the device can be accurately and reproducibly determined by photolithographically defining the spacing between the permanent magnet layer portions overlying the active ferromagnetic layer.

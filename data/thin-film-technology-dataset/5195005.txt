A thin film magnetic transducer includes a yoke having a plurality of arms and a plurality of coils, at least one of which is intertwined with the yoke to provide multiple flux interactions therebetween. Each arm includes a plurality of elongated segments that are oriented obliquely to each other and have easy axes of magnetization respectively transverse to the directions of flux conduction through the segments, and the segments (and arms) are joined together to cause flux to pass between them without flowing parallel to the easy axes.

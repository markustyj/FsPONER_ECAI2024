A magnetic material which may be employed as a thin film magnetic layer within magnetic heads, and a method for forming the magnetic material as a thin film magnetic layer for use within magnetic heads. The magnetic material has an elemental composition comprising about 40 to about 60 weight percent iron, about 40 to about 60 weight percent nickel and about 0.002 to about 1 weight percent tin. The magnetic material may be formed as a thin film magnetic layer for use within a magnetic head through an electrochemical plating method employing an aqueous plating solution comprising iron (II) ions, nickel (II) ions and tin (II) ions. When electrodeposited and anisotropically magnetically aligned, or when thermally annealed and anisotropically magnetically aligned the thin film magnetic layer possess a higher saturation magnetization, a higher anisotropy, a comparable easy axis coercivity, a lower hard axis permittivity and a higher resistivity than conventional thin film magnetic layers formed of permalloy (nickel-iron 80:20 w/w) alloys.

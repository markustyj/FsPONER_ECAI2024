A seed layer is provided between a first read gap layer and a free layer of a spin valve sensor for increasing the magnetoresistive coefficient dr/R of the sensor by improving the microstructure of the free layer. The seed layer may be a nickel iron oxide (NiFeO) material or a cobalt niobium (CoNb) based material. In other embodiments of the invention a buffer layer is located between the seed layer and the free layer for still further increasing the magnetoresistive coefficient dr/R of the sensor by further improving the microstructure of the free layer. The buffer layer may be tantalum (Ta) or copper (Cu).

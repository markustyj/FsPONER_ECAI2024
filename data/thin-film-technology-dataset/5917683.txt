A thin-film magnetic head (101) includes windings assembled from two levels (105, 106) having two electrically conducting layers (103, 104), each including a connecting track (107, 116) and a winding (110, 113). To reduce the electrical resistance, auxiliary tracks (130, 131) which are in contact with the connecting tracks and also form part of the layers extend parallel to the connecting tracks. Consequently, no additional manufacturing steps are required.

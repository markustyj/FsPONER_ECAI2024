A thin film magnetic head has a recording gap layer made of a nonmagnetic material, lower and upper magnetic pole layers made of a magnetic material, the lower and upper magnetic pole layers sandwiching the recording gap layer, and a magnetic material side layer deposited via a nonmagnetic material side layer on at least a part of a side surface of at least the upper magnetic pole layer.

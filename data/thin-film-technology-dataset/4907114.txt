A magneto-resistive type read head has a substrate, a magnetic film exhibiting a magneto-resistive effect arranged in the widthwise direction of the track of a magnetic writing disk, and lead electrodes for feeding an electric current to the track width portion of the magnetic film for reading the signals written in the magnetic writing disk. The magneto-resistive film extends over a width wider than the track width portion and a soft magnetic thin film is formed over the magneto-resistive film on either side of the track width portion to absorb the domain wall so that the magneto-resistive film takes the single domain structure.

A thin film magnetic read/write head is conditioned by (i) causing the head to perform a first operation (e.g., a read operation), (ii) determining if the first operation was performed acceptably, and (iii) if not, causing the head to perform a second operation (e.g., a write operation) that is capable of increasing the likelihood that the head will be able to perform the first operation acceptably.

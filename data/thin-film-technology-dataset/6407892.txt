A magnetic recording and reading device which has a transfer rate of not less than 50 MB/s and which includes a magnetic recording medium having an absolute value of normalized noise coefficient per recording density of not more than 2.5.times.10.sup.-8 (.mu.Vrms)(inch)(.mu.m).sup.0.5 /(.mu.Vpp). The magnetic recording and reading device also includes a magnetic head which is mounted on an integrated circuit suspension so that a total inductance is reduced to be not more than 65 nH and has a magnetic core which is not more than 35 .mu.m of length. A part of the magnetic core being formed by a magnetic film having a resistivity exceeding at least 50 .mu..OMEGA.cm or by a multilayer film consisting of a magnetic film and an insulating film. A fast R/W-IC having a line width of not more than 0.35 .mu.m is installed in a position within 2 cm from a rear end of the magnetic head, and the magnetic head is provided with a reading element comprising one of a giant magnetoresistance effect element and a thin film having tunneling-magnetoresistance effect, with an effective track width of not more than 0.9 .mu.m, and which performs reading of magnetic information at an areal density of not less than 5 Gb/in.sup.2.

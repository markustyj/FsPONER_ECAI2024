A magnetoresistive device having a first pole, a second pole, and a first tapered pole pedestal therebetween and magnetically connected to the second pole. The first tapered pole has a width that increases with increasing distance away from the air bearing surface, ABS. The magnetoresistive device can also include a second tapered pole pedestal magnetically connected to the first pole, and separated from the first tapered pole pedestal by a write gap. The second tapered pole pedestal has a width that increases with increasing distance away from the air bearing surface. A method of the present invention includes defining the trackwidth of a write element by lapping a tapered pole pedestal. More specifically, the trackwidth is given by a known taper angle, a zero throat width, and a throat height, wherein the throat height is controlled precisely by lapping.

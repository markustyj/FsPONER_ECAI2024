 According to one embodiment, a differential magnetoresistive effect element comprises a first magnetoresistive effect element having a first pinning layer, a first intermediate layer, and a first free layer. The differential magnetoresistive effect element also comprises a second magnetoresistive effect element stacked via a spacer layer above the first magnetoresistive effect element, the second magnetoresistive effect element having a second pinning layer, a second intermediate layer, and a second free layer. The first magnetoresistive effect element and the second magnetoresistive effect element show in-opposite-phase resistance change in response to a magnetic field in the same direction, and tp2&gt;tp1 is satisfied when a thickness of the first pinning layer is tp1, and a thickness of the second pinning layer is tp2. In another embodiment, the first and second magnetoresistive effect elements may be CPP-GMR elements. Other elements, heads, and magnetic recording/reading devices are described according to other embodiments.

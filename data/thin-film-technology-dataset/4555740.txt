A thin film transducer is provided for inductively recording and magnetoresistively reading magnetic information. The thin film magnetoresistive (MR) element is mounted on a bottom yoke member and is provided with means, which may be a pair of legs of the MR material extending in the same direction, so as to define a single magnetic domain in the MR element. The read conductor is provided in the form of a "barber pole" so that the angled transducer gap thereof overlies the magnetic domain in the MR element. The bottom yoke is a planar surface essentially dimensionless with respect to the other elements of the transducer head while the top yoke is specifically shaped so as to have a tail portion which overlies the write conductor and is parallel to the transducer gap in the read conductor.

The present invention provides increased stabilization of the magnetization of a single domain thin magnetic film over that attainable in the rectangular thin film known in the prior art by shaping the magnetic film as a rhomboid rather than as a rectangle. Practice of the invention teaches angling the transverse sides of the film with respect to the longitudinal sides either at an angle equal to, or smaller than, the angle at the bias point of the magnetization with respect to the direction of the easy axis, as established by an external bias field. Under these conditions the biased magnetization of the film, being either parallel to, or at a positive angle with respect to the transverse sides of the rhomboid, either generates no charges at the transverse edges of the film, or actually generates charges which produce a field parallel to the longitudinal component of the magnetization which stabilizes the magnetization of the single domain rather than destabilizes it.

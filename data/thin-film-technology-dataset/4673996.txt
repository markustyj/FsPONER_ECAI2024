A slider head assembly for flying a magnetic head at very low clearances on a fluid film over a moving recording media. This improved slider head assembly has at least one air bearing surface that flies above the recording medium due to pressurization of air under that bearing surface as the recording medium is rotated. The air bearing surface is provided with a transverse pressurization contour (TPC) along each side edge of the bearing surface such that any air flow from the side of the slider assembly, due to skew angle operation and/or access velocity, produces pressurization adjacent to one side edge and expansion adjacent to the other side edge of each air bearing surface. The pressure distribution across each air bearing surface is substantially symmetrical from side to side. This construction makes the slider assembly flying height and roll angle essentially insensitive to skew angle and/or access velocity. One of the embodiments utilizes a TPC having a linear taper of generally less than one degree. This embodiment is produced with a minor modification to conventional fabrication techniques.

A thin-film, perpendicular magnetic head includes a magnetic recording and reproducing substrate having a mechanochemically polished principal surface that includes a plurality of grooves filled with a nonmagnetic material; a thin-film conducting coil located on the polished surface of the substrate; an insulating layer of inorganic oxide covering the conductor coil and the polished principle surface of the magnetic substrate, this insulating layer including a via hole formed therein and having an exposed surface which is mechanochemically polished; a thin-film main pole on the polished surface of the insulating layer; and a protective overcoat covering the main pole.

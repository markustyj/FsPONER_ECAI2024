To provide a spin-valve type magnetic head having high read output even if track width is narrow and high stability, a magnetic head according to the invention is provided with a spin-valve type magnetoresistive element in which a single magnetic domain turning ferromagnetic layer is formed on a soft magnetic free layer via a non-magnetic separating layer, the soft magnetic free layer and the single magnetic domain turning ferromagnetic layer are magnetostatically coupled at the end of track width, a closed magnetic circuit is formed and the soft magnetic layer has magnetization substantially induced in a direction substantially perpendicular to an external magnetic field.

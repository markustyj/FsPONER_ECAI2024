A magnetic head has an exchange isolated poletip located between a shield of an MR sensor and a write pole of an inductive sensor. The poletip is preferably made of high B.sub.s material, allowing the flux that travels through the much larger pole layer to funnel through the poletip without saturation. The poletip is isolated from the shield layer in order to decouple the shield layer from unfavorable domain patterns that may occur in the poletip, which in turn reduces noise in the sensor, while the shield layer serves to complete the inductive circuit. Despite having a poletip isolated by nonmagnetic material, heads built according to this invention have demonstrated high overwrite as well as remarkably low noise.

 A thin-film magnetic head comprises first and second magnetic pole groups, magnetically connected to each other, having respective magnetic pole parts opposing each other on a side of a medium-opposing surface; a recording gap layer formed between the magnetic pole parts; and a thin-film coil insulated from the first and second magnetic pole groups and helically wound about at least one of them; which are laminated on a substrate. The thin-film coil comprises a first conductor group having a plurality of inner conductor parts disposed between the first and second magnetic pole groups, a second conductor group having a plurality of outer conductor parts disposed outside the second magnetic pole group, and a connecting part group having a plurality of connecting parts for connecting the inner conductor parts to the outer conductor parts. Each of the first and second conductor groups includes an insulating contact structure for making the inner or outer conductor parts in contact with each other by way of an insulating film.

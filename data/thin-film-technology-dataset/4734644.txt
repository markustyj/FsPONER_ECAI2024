A yoke type magnetic transducer head utilizing a magnetoresistance effect in which a magnetoresistance effect sensing portion is provided so as to magnetically couple a cut-away portion in a magnetic circuit including an operation gap and a magnetic yoke having in its one portion the cut-away portion and in which a first bias magnetic field is applied to the magnetoresistance effect sensing portion by a first magnetic flux that is generated when a current is flowed through the magnetoresistance effect sensing portion, or when a current is flowed through both the magnetoresistance effect sensing portion and a bias conductor, which includes a hard magnetic layer for generating a second magnetic flux by which a second bias magnetic field is applied to the magnetoresistance effect sensing portion and for passing through the magnetic yoke a magnetic flux which cancels at least a part of the first magnetic flux which passes through the magnetic yoke.

 A thin film head comprising a GMR element formed of an antiferromagnetic layer, a pinning layer, a nonmagnetic conductive layer and a free magnetic layer; and a pair of the right and the left laminated longitudinal biasing layers, each of the layers containing a hard magnetic layer, a nonmagnetic layer and a soft magnetic layer provided on said free magnetic layer of GMR element. Said hard magnetic layer and said soft magnetic layer are antiferromagnetically exchange-coupled via said nonmagnetic layer, and said hard magnetic layer and said free magnetic layer locating next to said hard magnetic layer are ferromagnetically coupled. The present invention contains also a method for manufacturing the thin film head.

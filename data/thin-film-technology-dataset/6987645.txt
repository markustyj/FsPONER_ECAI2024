 A thin-film magnetic head comprises a bottom pole layer, a top pole layer, a recording gap layer, and a thin-film coil. The thin-film coil is wound in a helical manner around the top pole layer while the coil is insulated from the bottom pole layer and the top pole layer. The thin-film coil includes a plurality of inner conductor portions, a plurality of outer conductor portions, and a plurality of connecting portions that connect the inner conductor portions to the outer conductor portions. The inner conductor portions are disposed between the bottom pole layer and the top pole layer. The outer conductor portions are disposed on a side opposite to the inner conductor portions, the top pole layer being disposed in between. A thin insulating film is only provided between adjacent ones of the inner conductor portions.

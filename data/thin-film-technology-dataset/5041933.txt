A magnetic head suspension system for use in a photofinishing operation comprises a fixed support and a pair of magentic head suspension assemblies each rotatably mounted on the support. The magnetic head suspension assemblies are biased towards each other to engage opposite edges of the film respectively. Each magnetic head suspension assembly is rotatable relative to the fixed support to compensate for film width variations and film edge irregularities to insure constant orientation of the magnetic heads with respect to the film edges.

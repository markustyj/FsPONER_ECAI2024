A bidirectional thin-film magnetoresistive tape head assembly. The invention minimizes wear on the head assembly by: (1) minimizing the distance between the read elements and their respective write elements, (2) forming the head assembly from hard materials, and (3) placing a hard block between the read and write elements. The head assembly uses only a single pair of read and write elements per data track, but the pairs are reversed with respect to each other so that the head assembly is capable of reading-while-writing on the tape in both directions.

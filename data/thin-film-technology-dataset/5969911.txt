An inductive/MR composite type thin film magnetic head which realizes high speed, high density recording while at the same time preventing the occurrence of read-out error by reducing NLTS. In one embodiment an inductive/MR composite type thin-film magnetic head is equipped with [a] an inductive head used for writing in which a magnetic gap layer, a conductive coil and insulating layers are laminated between upper and lower magnetic films, and [b] a magnetic resistance (MR) head used for read-out consisting of an MR element sandwiched between an upper shield which also serves as the aforementioned lower magnetic film, and a lower shield, the aforementioned conductive coil is formed in the shape of a solenoid which is wrapped around the aforementioned upper magnetic film by forming a lower coil part consisting of numerous segments on the surface of the first insulating layer, and then forming an upper coil part consisting of numerous segments from a point above a second insulating layer, upper magnetic film and third insulating layer laminated on the surface of the lower coil part, so that the respective end portions of the segments of the upper coil part are alternately connected with the respective end portions of the segments of the lower coil part.

A spin valve magnetoresistive sensor includes a substrate and a layered structure formed on the substrate. The layered structure includes a pair of thin film layers of ferromagnetic material separated from each other by a nonmagnetic spacer. The direction of magnetization of one of the thin film layers is pinned by a first permanent magnet layer. A second permanent magnet layer is located adjacent to the other of the thin film layers for longitudinal biasing purposes. The first permanent magnet layer has significantly higher coercivity than the second permanent magnet layer.

A thin-film magnetic head for perpendicular magnetic recording comprising an auxiliary magnetic pole layer; a main magnetic pole layer; a conductive coil layer in a spiral shape which is disposed between the main magnetic pole layer and the auxiliary magnetic pole layer and which cross the magnetic circuit; and insulating layers electrically insulating the auxiliary magnetic pole layer and the main magnetic pole layer from the conductive coil layer. The insulating layers have flat surfaces formed at the sides further from the auxiliary magnetic pole layer, the front end portion of the main magnetic pole layer is provided on one of the flat surfaces, and the conductive coil layer is disposed under the main magnetic pole layer so that a part of the conductive coil layer opposes the front end portion of the main magnetic pole layer.

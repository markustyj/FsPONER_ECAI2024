A thin film structure suitable for use as a shield for a read element of a transducing head has an first ferromagnetic layer, a second ferromagnetic layer and a first decoupling layer. The first decoupling layer is positioned between the first ferromagnetic layer and the second ferromagnetic layer. An easy axis of the first ferromagnetic layer is substantially parallel to an easy axis of the second ferromagnetic layer. The first decoupling layer causes a magnetization of the first ferromagnetic layer to be substantially antiparallel to a magnetization of the second ferromagnetic layer.

 The magnetic head in accordance with the present invention comprises first and second magnetic pole layers, a link part for magnetically linking the first and second magnetic pole layers, and a thin-film coil helically wound about at least one of the first and second magnetic pole layers. The thin-film coil comprises a plurality of inner conductor parts arranged in parallel with each other with an insulating film interposed therebetween, a plurality of first outer conductor parts located on the side of the first or second magnetic pole layer opposite from the side where the inner conductor parts are located, a plurality of second outer conductor parts located on the side of the first outer conductor parts opposite from the side where the inner conductor parts are located, and a plurality of connecting parts for connecting their corresponding inner conductor parts and first and second outer conductor parts.

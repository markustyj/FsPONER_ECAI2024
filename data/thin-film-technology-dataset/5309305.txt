A read/write head includes a dual element MR sensor and a superimposed inductive head. In an implementation of the invention, the MR sensor structure includes two spaced magnetoresistive (MR) elements on which antiferromagnetic (AFe) thin films, preferably of iron manganese, are deposited. The AFe thin films act as exchange bias layers with the MR elements, biasing the MR layers in opposite directions and perpendicular to the surface of a magnetic medium. Recorded magnetic signals are sensed differentially and the output signal is characterized by increased amplitude and improved signal-to-noise ratio.

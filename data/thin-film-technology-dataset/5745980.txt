An inductive pinched-gap thin film head (TFH) device having pole-tips which are in substantial contact along their side-edges, thereby precisely defining a pinched-gap segment. The substantial contact between the pole-tips' side-edges effectively eliminates all flux lines emanating from the edges and corners during the write operation. The write magnetic field is thus precisely confined to across the pinched-gap segment. As a result, the written medium track width is accurately defined by the width of the pinched-gap segment with high degree of magnetization coherency and virtual elimination of the track-edge noise. The improved (medium) signal-to-noise ratio facilitates substantial increase of the track density. Photolithographic definition and etching of the gap-vias to the bottom pole-tip, followed by deposition of the top pole-tip, facilitates precise and consistent control of the width of the pinched-gap segment (and the written track) drawn to .ltoreq.1 .mu.m.

A thin film magnetic head in which at least a magnetic layer, a conductor layer constituting a coil and an insulating layer (or layers) are formed and patterned to a predetermined shape on a substrate, wherein the conductor layer is formed of a Cu--Ag alloy of Cu.sub.100-x Ag.sub.x where 0.1.ltoreq..times..ltoreq.10 in atomic percent. The gap surface has a surface irregularity level not exceeding 350 Angstroms at Rmax and the conductor layer has a resistivity of 2 .mu..OMEGA.cm or less even after heat treatment at 450.degree. to 550.degree.

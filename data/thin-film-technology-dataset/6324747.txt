A method of fabricating a magnetoresistive (MR) proximity head slider having substantial immunity to thermal asperities includes providing the head slider having an inductive write transducer and an MR read transducer each extending to a first region of an air bearing surface (ABS) of the head slider. The method further includes removing a portion of the first region of the ABS corresponding to the MR read transducer to form a cavity in the ABS. The cavity in the ABS provides a second region of the ABS such that after removal of the portion of the first region the MR read transducer extends only to the second region of the ABS.

A virtually transparent magnetic layer is included as an additional layer in a color negative film. Information exchange between various users of the film--such as (for example) the film manufacturer, the camera user, the dealer and photofinisher--is carried via plural longitudinal magnetic tracks on the film that begin and end in individual frames. Each track is dedicated to the writing and reading of a predetermined set of parameters related to the corresponding frame. The photofinisher-dedicated tracts fill the exposed image area of each frame. The camera-dedicated tracks lie along the edges of the film between the film perforations, the perforations being widely spaced for this purpose. All data is recorded on the film using a novel self-clocking code which is completely self-clocking, in order to provide automatic data synchronization between the various users without requiring that any of them to transport the film at the same speed or even at a uniform speed when reading and writing. A start sentinel character and stop sentinel character, each having a predetermined self-clocking encoded binary bit sequence, are placed at the beginning and end of each track respectively, and facilitate automatic detection of film transport direction.

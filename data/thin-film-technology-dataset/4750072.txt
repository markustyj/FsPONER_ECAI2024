A thin-film magnetic head provided with a magnetic thin film having a magnetostrictive characteristic is disclosed in which a central part of magnetic core formed of the magnetic thin film has a positive magnetostriction constants, and side parts of the magnetic core on both sides of the central part have negative magnetostriction constants. Thus, when a stress due to the patterning of the magnetic core varies the magnetic characteristic of the magnetic core, the permeability of the magnetic core becomes high, and the magnetic stability thereof is improved. Accordingly, a signal reproduced by this magnetic head has a high output level, and is low in noise level.

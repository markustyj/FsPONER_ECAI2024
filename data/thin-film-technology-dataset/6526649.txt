To present a manufacturing method of a magneto-resistive effect type head capable of manufacturing a magneto-resistive effect type head with stabilized head characteristics. A magneto-resistive effect type head is manufactured in a method comprising a step of forming a magneto-resistive effect film (30) in a trapezoidal shape (30A) having a specified abutting angle .theta.1 by means of ion milling through a resist mask of overhang structure, a step of forming bias magnet films (31) for filling in sides of the magneto-resistive effect film (30), and a step of forming an electrode film (33) to overlap partly with the magneto-resistive effect film (30) through the resist mask. The angle of the ion milling is 5.degree. or less to the normal of the substrate surface. The angle of ion beam sputtering when forming the electrode film (33) is 30.degree. or less to the normal of the substrate surface. At the step of for forming the trapezoidal shape (30A), the anti-ferromagnetic layer is etched to the position of 30% or less of its depth. A TiW film of 3 nm to 5 nm in thickness is used inn the base film (32) of the bias magnet film (31).

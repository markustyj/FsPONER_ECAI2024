A spin-valve type thin film element includes an antiferromagnetic layer; a fixed magnetic layer formed so as to be in contact with the antiferromagnetic layer, the magnetization direction of the fixed magnetic layer being fixed by the exchange anisotropic magnetic field between the fixed magnetic layer and the antiferromagnetic layer; a free magnetic layer formed on the fixed magnetic layer with a nonmagnetic conductive layer therebetween; a bias layer for setting the magnetization direction of the free magnetic layer in the direction perpendicular to the magnetization direction of the fixed magnetic layer; and a conductive layer for applying a sensing current into the fixed magnetic layer, the nonmagnetic conductive layer, and the free magnetic layer. The magnetization of the fixed magnetic layer in the central region is fixed in the height direction, and the magnetization of the fixed magnetic layer in the end regions is fixed in the direction inclined in relation to the height direction. A method of manufacturing such a spin-valve type thin film element is also disclosed.

A thin film magnetic core array has a large number of individual thin film core memory elements arranged on a substrate with X, Y, Z and SENSE conductor leads reeving through the core elements between contact pads arranged about the periphery of the array. Each thin film magnetic memory element includes a bottom pole, a top pole forming a closed magnetic path with the top pole, the structure surrounding the leads passing through the core, and insulation material for electrically insulating the leads from each other and from the pole pieces. The SENSE lead from the array is coupled to a miniature thin film transformer which amplifies the signals read from the individual core elements. The transformer has a bottom pole, a top pole forming a closed magnetic path with the bottom pole, including a central leg extending between the top and bottom poles, and a pair of electrically conductive coils mutually spaced in the region between the top and bottom poles.

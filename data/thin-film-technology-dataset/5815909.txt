A method is provided for fabricating a thin film magnetic head including a plurality of layered components. One or more vias are formed through an electrically insulative substrate which includes first and second opposed major surfaces. The via includes an interior side surface. The via is filled with electrically conductive material which is situated in contact with the interior side surface of the via. A via connective member is thus formed which extends between the first and second surfaces of the substrate. A protective via cap is formed atop the via connective member to protect the via connective member from subsequent etching operations. A thin film head is formed atop the first surface of the substrate by building up components of the head layer by layer. This forming a thin film head step includes the step of forming a coil for exciting the head by etching, with an etchant, portions of a layer of electrically conductive material within the head. The via protective cap is fabricated from a material which is substantially resistant to etching by the etchant. In this manner the via conductive member is shielded from the potentially deleterious effects of etching. The via connective member typically couples the coil to circuitry external to the thin film head.

A process for producing a planar thin film magnetic head wherein a sacrificial layer is introduced to provide control of the gap planarization procedure. Unbounded planar layers of lower pole-tip material and nonmagnetic gap material are first deposited and covered with a sacrificial layer that may be selectively removed by solvent. A critical layer island is then formed by etching the excess, thereby ensuring ideal planar characteristics at the edges of the critical gap layer. Following island formation, the entire assembly is covered with a nonmagnetic insulating layer and lapped or etched smooth. This planarization process is adjusted to end in the sacrificial layer. The remaining sacrificial layer material is then removed by solvent, a step that not only ensures the integrity of the underlying critical gap and pole layers but also creates the upper step needed for staggered pole-tip and conformal pole-tip head configurations.

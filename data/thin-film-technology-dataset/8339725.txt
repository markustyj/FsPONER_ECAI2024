 The invention provides a magnetic head slider and a magnetic disc drive which can position at a high precision and in a simple manner. A magnetic head slider (4) includes a recording and reproducing element (20) writing and reading data, a heat generating element (21) arranged at least in one side of directions (that is, a width direction of the magnetic head slider (4)) corresponding to a width direction of a recording track with respect to the recording and reproducing element (20), and generating heat on the basis of a current application, and a member (25) interposed at least between the recording and reproducing element (20) and the heat generating element (21) and expanding in correspondence to the heat generation of the heat generating element (21).

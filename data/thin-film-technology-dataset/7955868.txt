 A method of forming a micromagnetic device on a substrate including forming a first insulating layer above the substrate, a first seed layer above the first insulating layer, a first conductive winding layer above the first seed layer, and a second insulating layer above the first conductive winding layer. The method also includes forming a first magnetic core layer above the second insulating layer, a third insulating layer above the first magnetic core layer, and a second magnetic core layer above the third insulating layer. The method still further includes forming a fourth insulating layer above the second magnetic core layer, a second seed layer above the fourth insulating layer, and a second conductive winding layer above the second seed layer and in vias to the first conductive winding layer. The first and second conductive winding layers form a winding for the micromagnetic device.

 A slider mounted read/write head is protected from thermal asperities due to head-disk interactions by a ridge formed along an interfacial plane that extends above the ABS plane of the slider. The ridge is formed as part of a lapping process that is directed from the read/write head towards the slider substrate and uses an abrasive slurry to which may be added a strong base such as KOH. The height of the ridge is less than approximately 2 nm.

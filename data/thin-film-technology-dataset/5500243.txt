A process for forming dielectric thin film coating suitable for use in magnetic thin film heads includes the application of a spin-on-glass material on a substrate, the spinning of the substrate, the preheating of the substrate and thin film to remove the solvents in the spin-on-glass material, and the heating in a reducing or in an inert atmosphere of the film to provide a conversion to a SiO.sub.2 film. The reducing and the inert atmospheres permit carbon to be left in the film. The presence of the carbon improves structural properties of the thin films.

An electrically conductive element is employed in proximity to a thin film magnetic structure. The conductive element has current applied to it which is just sufficient to maintain, by field coupling between the thin film structure and the conductive element, the given magnetic orientation of the thin film structure, this occurring despite the application of a signal field tending to reorient the magnetization of the thin film structure. Such current is, therefore, the analog of the applied signal field and, since the magnetization of the thin film structure, by virtue of induced magnetic feedback, does not appreciably change direction, harmonics of any signal field applied to the thin film structure, and noise, are not manifested in the current analog.

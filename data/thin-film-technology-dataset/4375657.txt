A magnetic head assembly useful as a write head is formed with a ferrite substrate, having a recessed channel on one surface in which a conductive coil is deposited, and a ferrite closure having a planar surface that is joined to the substrate surface to establish a transducing gap and to enclose the recessed coil. In operation, pulsed write current is applied to the write head and a significant reduction in Joule heating is realized. A low resistance substrate is employed to provide a high saturation flux density.

A first magnetic layer (3) is laminated on a magnetic yoke film (2) forming a closed magnetic circuit containing a magnetic gap so as to be magnetically coupled to the magnetic yoke film (2), and a magnetic separation layer (4), a second magnetic layer (5) and an antiferromagnetic layer (6) are laminated on the first magnetic layer (3). Further, a pair of electrodes (1, 7) are formed so that the laminate comprising the above layers is sandwiched between the electrodes. A permanent magnet film 8 is disposed to apply a bias magnetic field to the first magnetic layer (3). The magnetic separation layer (4) is formed of an insulator. Tunnel current is made to flow between the electrodes (1, 7) through the magnetic separation layer (4), and magnetic signals in the magnetic yoke film (2) are detected by using the antiferromagnetic tunnel magnetoresistance effect that the tunnel current is varied in accordance with variation of the difference in the magnetization direction between the first magnetic layer (3) and the second magnetic layer (5).

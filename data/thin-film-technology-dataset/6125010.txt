A thin film head and a method for fabricating the same comprises depositing a first non-magnetic seedlayer on a substrate, forming a bottom portion of a magnetic core on the first non-magnetic seedlayer, depositing a second non-magnetic seedlayer and forming a top portion of the magnetic core on the second non-magnetic seedlayer. A gap comprised of non-magnetic material is formed between the top and bottom portions of the magnetic core. The stability of the thin film head while in a relaxed state and its read performance are significantly improved.

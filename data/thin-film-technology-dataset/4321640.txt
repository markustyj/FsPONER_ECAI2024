A magnetic head having a magnetoresistive element of the type which is covered with one or more strips of electrically readily conducting material which extend at an angle of approximately 45.degree. with the longitudinal axis for causing a measuring current to flow through the element at an angle with the longitudinal axis. The magnetoresistive element bridges a gap between two components of magnetic material one of which is destined to cooperate with a magnetic recording medium. In this manner the edges of the element are magnetically short-circuited, which improves the linearity of the playback characteristic.

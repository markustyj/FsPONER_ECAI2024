 A lower magnetic pole front end portion is provided on a lower magnetic pole main layer, and then, an upper magnetic pole front end portion or an upper magnetic pole front end layer is formed on the flat surface so as to enhance the track width accuracy of thin film head. The height of the lower magnetic pole front end portion is increased so as to enhance the magnetic field intensity. A projection step portion having a width larger than that of the upper magnetic pole front end layer is provided on the lower magnetic pole front end portion. The unnecessary medium in-plane magnetic field can be thus reduced in the off-track position. The respective parts of the head are corrected, thereby realizing a high recording magnetic field intensity exceeding 716 kA/m (9000Oe).

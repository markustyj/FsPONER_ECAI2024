A small light-weight thin film magnetic head apparatus for a rigid disk or a floppy disc. The apparatus includes a magnetic head formed directly on a distal end of a suspension as a thin layer, one end of the suspension being supported by an arm. This magnetic head is very small-sized and light-weight and has a head gap in direct contact with a recording medium, increasing the recording density and the read/write speed. Because of its reduced weight of the thin film magnetic head, a remarkably improved degree of followability with respect to the recording medium can be achieved. A method of manufacturing this magnetic head apparatus is also disclosed.

 Methods for fabrication of magnetic write heads, and more specifically to fabrication of magnetic poles and trailing magnetic pole steps. A write pole may first be patterned on a substrate. Then a side gap material may be patterned along sidewall portions of the write pole. Thereafter, a masking layer may be deposited and patterned to expose a portion of the write pole. A trailing magnetic pole step may be formed on the exposed portion of the write pole.

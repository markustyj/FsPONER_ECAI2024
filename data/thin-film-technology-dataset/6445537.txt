A magnetic head having an enhanced recession resistance characteristic, and a method of fabricating the magnetic head having the enhanced recession resistance characteristic is disclosed. The improvement is the addition of one or more hard protective layers exposed edgewise at the media-head interface. Each protective layer is formed between the substrate and the top closure of the magnetic head to a thickness of greater than approximately 0.2 micrometers and a hardness of greater than approximately 850 Knoop. The protective layers are formed by depositing a hard metal film above, below or within the read and write transducers inside the magnetic head. The hard metal film is selected for its hardness, ease of use during the fabrication process, and compatibility with adjoining materials. The hard metals include, but are not limited to, chromium, iridium, rhodium, tantalum, titanium and tungsten.

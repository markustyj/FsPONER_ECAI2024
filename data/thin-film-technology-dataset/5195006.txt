A thin-film magnetic head element comprising, on an insulative substrate, a core made by laminating a magnetic film for the lower core and a magnetic film for the upper core provided with a head gap which forms a magnetic pole generating a recording magnetic field, and a conductive film for coil crossing with the core through an insulator, being provided with a concave void which makes the shape of the magnetic pole in the vicinity of the head gap to be concave. The depth of the head gap is made shallow and the thickness of the magnetic pole outside the vicinity of the head gap satisfactorily thick. The length of the concave void in the moving direction of a recording medium is 1 to 7 .mu.m.

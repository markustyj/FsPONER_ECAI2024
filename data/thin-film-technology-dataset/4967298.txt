An elongated magnetoresistive sensor strip longitudinally biased to maintain a single domain sense region by exchange-biasing material atomically coupled to the strip at the ends of the strip outside of a central sense region. The magnetoresistive sense strip is included in a magnetic head which has a leading pole, a trailing pole, and a shield. A first gap is located between the leading pole and the trailing pole and a second gap is located between the trailing pole and the shield with the sense strip located in the second gap.

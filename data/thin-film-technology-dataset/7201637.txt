 A method for simultaneously planarizing to relatively equal smoothness a thin film magnetic head hardbaked resist structure having relatively low surface energy and one or more additional thin film magnetic head structures containing other materials having comparatively higher surface energy, such as copper, hardbaked resist, alumina and NiFe. The method begins with preparation of a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) slurry targeted at equaling the removal rate of the materials to be planarized. The CMP slurry includes a liquid vehicle, an abrasive, and a surfactant. The CMP slurry is applied to the surface of the structures to be planarized and the structures are simultaneously planarized using a CMP planarization technique.

A thin-film magnetic head with a layer-wise build-up on a nonmagnetic substrate for a recording medium which can be magnetized vertically comprises a magnetic conduction body carrying the magnetic flux, with two outer magnet legs and a further central magnet leg, the poles of which facing the recording medium are arranged one behind the other as seen in the direction of motion of the head, and with predetermined gap widths between each other, where the current conductors of a write/read coil arrangement extend through spaces formed between the central magnet leg and a respective outer magnet leg adjacent thereto. With this magnetic head it is possible to generate a magnetic writing field, the field pattern of which has a pronounced largely symmetrical maximum. It is provided that the current conductors of the coil arrangement also run through a further space where the current flow directions in the current conductors arranged on both sides of the central magnet leg are opposed to each other. It is particularly advantageous if the central magnet leg has, at least in the vicinity of the pole, a higher saturation magnetization than the outer magnet legs, so that these magnet legs are in magnetic saturation sooner than the central leg during writing.

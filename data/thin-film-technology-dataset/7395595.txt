 A method for forming a P3 layer with NiFe and alumina mask using resist shrink process for use in perpendicular magnetic write heads. The method includes forming a laminated layer, forming an alumina layer on top of the laminated layer, depositing a conductive layer onto the laminated layer, forming a plating frame on a gap layer. The plating frame has a trench defined by plating track, the alumina, laminated and conductive layers each including an area below the trench. The method further includes shrinking the trench, plating NiFe into a portion of the shrunk trench, stripping the plating frame, removing the conductive layer except the conductive layer formed below the trench, removing the alumina layer except the alumina layer formed below the trench, removing the laminated layer except the laminated layer formed below the trench and patterning the laminated layer formed below the trench.

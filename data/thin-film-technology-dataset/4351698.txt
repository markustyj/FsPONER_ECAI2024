A method of fabricating variable sloped, as well as straight, edges on a permalloy body of a thin film head is disclosed. The process comprises forming a titanium layer on the permalloy body covering at least those areas of the body which are intended to exhibit the variable slope. A photoresist layer is formed atop the titanium layer and the permalloy body and is removed in those areas of the titanium layer and permalloy body which are not to be retained as part of the thin film head after etching. The body is then etched with an etchant containing HF and FeCl.sub.3 to form variable sloped edges in those areas of the permalloy body covered with titanium and photoresist and straight edges in those areas of the permalloy body covered only with photoresist.

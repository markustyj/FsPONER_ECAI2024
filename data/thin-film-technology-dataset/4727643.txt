A method for manufacturing a magnetic head by a thin-film technique which head comprises at least two magnet legs which have pole surfaces which face a recording medium and which lie in a common plane. With this method, a preliminary product of the magnetic head having end pieces of the legs which extend beyond this plane and which are spaced by a small gap, and an electrically conducting structure are applied in such a manner that this structure is separated, if the substrate body is processed by material removal from the side facing the recording medium, just when the plane of the pole surfaces has been reached, into two conductor parts electrically insulated from each other. With this method, the area portion required for the manufacture of a magnetic head on the substrate body is to be reduced. It is provided for this purpose that, for forming the preliminary product of the magnetic head, at least in the region of the gap between the end pieces of the magnet legs, one of the magnet legs is provided with a thin metal layer electrically insulated therefrom as the one conductor part of the conductor structure, and the second magnet leg is deposited as the other conductor part in the region of its end piece directly on the metal layer.

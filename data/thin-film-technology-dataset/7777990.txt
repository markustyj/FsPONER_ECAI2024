 In a magnetic disk unit, the flying height margin of a magnetic recording element part during recording is reduced, whereby improvement in recording density and increase in capacity or decrease in size of the unit is realized. In one embodiment, a magnetic disk unit has a magnetic disk arranged in a freely rotational manner and a magnetic head slider disposed to face a surface of the magnetic disk, and generates air flow between the magnetic disk and the magnetic head slider for flying, and records data using a magnetic recording element. The magnetic head slider has a slider substrate part and a thin-film head part formed on the slider substrate part using a thin-film process. The thin-film head part has an insulating member, a magnetic recording element provided in the insulating member, and a heat radiation member for radiating heat generated by the magnetic recording element from lateral regions of the magnetic recording element to the slider substrate part.

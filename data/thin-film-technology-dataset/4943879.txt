A thin film magnetic head having a first magnetic layer of a saturation magnetic flux density greater than that of a Ni-Fe alloy and a second magnetic layer of a saturation magnetic flux density grater than that of a Ni-Fe alloy supported by a base layer, the magnetic layers for forming a magnetic core of the head with a non-magnetic material gap layer interposed therebetween, and an electrically insulating layer provided between the magnetic layers so that turns of coil wound about the magnetic core are partly formed in electrically insulated relation within the insulating layer, in which a metal film is provided between the first magnetic layer and the electrically insulating layer so that the electrically insulating layer does not contact with the first magnetic layer and/or another metal film is formed on the second magnetic layer so that the other metal layer is sandwiched between the non-magnetic layer and the second magnetic layer.

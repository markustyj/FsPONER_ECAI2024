 A method for forming a magnetic structure, such as a pole tip, includes forming a pole tip layer of magnetic material. A layer of polyimide precursor material is added above the pole tip layer and cured. A silicon-containing resist layer is added above the layer of polyimide precursor material and patterned. The resist layer is exposed to oxygen plasma for converting the resist into a glass-like material. Exposed portions of the cured polyimide precursor material are removed for exposing portions of the pole tip layer. The exposed portions of the pole tip layer are removed for forming a pole tip. Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) can then be performed to remove any unwanted material remaining above the pole tip.

 According to one embodiment, a perpendicular magnetic recording head includes a main magnetic pole having a trailing side and two lateral sides, a magnetic shield near the trailing side and both lateral sides of the main magnetic pole, the magnetic shield comprising: a first soft magnetic film with a relatively high saturation flux density positioned facing depthwise from a floating surface side thereof, a second soft magnetic film with a relatively low saturation flux density, and a first non-magnetic film. The head also includes a non-magnetic film interposed between the magnetic shield and the main magnetic pole, a first magnetic film magnetically coupled to the magnetic shield and the main magnetic pole on a side opposite a floating surface side thereof, and a coil surrounding a magnetic circuit, the magnetic circuit comprising the main magnetic pole and the first magnetic film. Other systems and methods are also described.

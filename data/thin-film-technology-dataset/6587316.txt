The relation of (RS1/H1)/(Rsg/Hg).ltoreq.0.02 is valid when the extending length in the vertical direction from an opposed face to an magnetic recording medium toward the inside of the electrode layer is represented by H1, a sheet resistance of the electrode layer is defined by Rs1, the extending length in the vertical direction from an opposed face to an magnetic recording medium toward the inside of the laminated body, or the elevation of the element, is defined by Hg, and the sheet resistance of the laminated body is defined by Rsg, thereby the output characteristics of the spin-valve type thin film magnetic element is improved while preventing side-reading from generating.

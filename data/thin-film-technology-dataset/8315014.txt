 Provided are a perpendicular magnetic recording head and a method of manufacturing the same. The perpendicular magnetic recording head includes a main pole including a pole tip applying a recording magnetic field to a recording medium, a coil surrounding the main pole in a solenoid shape such that recording magnetic field for recording information to a recording medium is generated at the pole tip, and a return yoke forming a magnetic path for the recording magnetic field together with the main pole and surrounding a portion of the coil passing above the main pole. The number of times that the coil passes above the main pole is smaller than the number of times that the coil passes below the main pole.

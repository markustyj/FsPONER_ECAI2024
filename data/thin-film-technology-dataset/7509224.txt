 A method for making an electrical connection between a head gimbal assembly and a tester. The method includes providing a solderless connector including a housing with bores extending from a first side of the housing to a second opposed side of the housing, and conductors within the bores of the housing. The conductors have a first end protruding from the first side of the housing and a second end protruding from the second side of the housing. The solderless connector is positioned so the first end of the conductor engages the conductive pad of the tester, and a clamp is applied to the first side of the electrical contact on the head gimbal assembly to urge the second side of the electrical contact against the second end of the conductor on the solderless connector.

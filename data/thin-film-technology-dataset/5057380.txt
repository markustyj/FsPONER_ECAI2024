Disclosed is a soft magnetic thin film having a basic composition of FecoNi or FeCoDy which is specified for use as a single layer film for increasing the saturation magnetic flux density and the coercive force.The soft magnetic properties are achieved by laminating the above defined soft magnetic thin film as the first soft magnetic thin film layer with a second magnetic thin film layer. In this case, crystal structures of the first and the second soft magnetic thin films should appropriately be selected and combined.

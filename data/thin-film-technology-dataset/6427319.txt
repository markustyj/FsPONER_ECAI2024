A method for protecting magnetic read/write head assembly against electrostatic discharge during disk drive manufacturing are disclosed. The magnetic head assembly is supported on a substrate having a magnetoresistive sensor element disposed in spaced relationship between several magnetic shield elements. Before a focused ion beam fabrication operation, at least a portion of an air bearing surface of the magnetic head assembly is coated with a thin and transparent layer of conductive material. This layer of conductive material is subsequent removed after the focused ion beam fabrication operation.

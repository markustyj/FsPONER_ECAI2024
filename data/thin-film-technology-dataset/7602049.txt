 Improved methods and structures are provided using capacitive techniques to reduce noise in high speed interconnections, such as in CMOS integrated circuits. Embodiments of an electronic device having a transmission line circuit include a first layer of electrically conductive material on a substrate and a first layer of insulating material on the first layer of the electrically conductive material. The first layer of insulating material has a thickness of less than 1.0 micrometers (.mu.m). A transmission line is formed on the first layer of insulating material and a second layer of insulating material is formed on the transmission line. A second layer of electrically conductive material is formed on the second layer of insulating material.

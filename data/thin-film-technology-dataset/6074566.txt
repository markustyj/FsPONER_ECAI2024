A thin film inductive write head has minimal organic insulation material in contact with the encapsulating overcoat. The process for its fabrication includes a reactive ion etching (RIE) process to remove the organic insulative material while still allowing the head top pole piece to be planar. The organic insulation material is removed by RIE down to the head gap layer in the region between the ABS and the coil. The etching is done with the top or second pole piece acting as a mask so that the planarized organic insulation material is still maintained over the portion of the coil that is located between the two pole pieces. Thus the organic insulation material is still present in this region as the planarization layer onto which the ferromagnetic layer for the second pole piece was deposited. This allows the encapsulating overcoat to be deposited directly on the gap layer, which is formed of the same material as the overcoat, rather than on the organic insulation material, in a substantial portion of the write head structure. In a further embodiment the write head also has the organic insulation material removed down to the gap layer between the coil turns in the portion of the coil that does not lie beneath the second pole piece. The region between the coil turns in this portion of the coil is filled with overcoat material during the head encapsulation process.

A thin film tape head assembly is formed by depositing a multiplicity of thin film transducers on a ceramic wafer or substrate. The wafer is divided into head bars, each of which has one or more thin film transducers on its face. End sections and a cover bar are joined to the head bar to form a head bar subassembly. A flexible cable or electrical pins are provided between the end sections to enable electrical connection between the head circuit and external circuitry. By joining a number of head bar subassemblies, a multigap thin film tape head assembly is produced to serve as a read/write device.

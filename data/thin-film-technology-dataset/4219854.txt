A thin film magnetic head assembly has a multi-turn electrical conducting coil, which is formed by deposition in an elliptical pattern. By virtue of the elliptical pattern, the coil turn portions between the back gap closure and transducing gap of the thin film head are relatively narrow, whereas the coil turn portions furthest from the transducing gap are widest. Corners and sharp ends are eliminated. Electrical resistance effects are thereby minimized and signal output is enhanced.

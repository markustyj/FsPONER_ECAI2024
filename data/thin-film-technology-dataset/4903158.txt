The invention teaches the use of a permanent magnet easy axis biasing structure having the same (or nearly so) physical geometry as the MR sense film itself, whereby a similar, but opposite, demagnetization field is generated in the biasing structure as is generated in the sense film. Thus, with the two demagnetization fields complementarily cancelling each other, any tendency of the sense film for multi-domain formation therein is cancelled (or at least lessened).

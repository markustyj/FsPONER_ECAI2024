 A write driver circuit for a magnetic storage medium that communicates with a write head having first and second nodes comprises a first driver circuit with an input and an output that communicates with the first node of the write head. A first charge pump communicates with said input and said output of said first driver circuit and provides additional current to said input of said first driver circuit during a first transition period between current flowing through the write head in a first direction and current flowing through the write head in a second direction. A second driver circuit with an input and an output communicates with the second node of the write head. A second charge pump communicates with said input and said output of said second driver circuit and provides additional current to said input of said second driver circuit during a second transition period between current flowing through the write head in said second direction and current flowing through the write head in said first direction.

 For a Tunneling Magnetoresistive (TMR) element, an electrode is used as a magnetic shield or vice versa. This can pose a problem in that noise from a heater source or electromagnetic induction has a direct influence on the TMR element, namely, on a read signal. According to one embodiment of the present invention, however, a thin film head portion has an insulating film, a heater, an electromagnetic shield, a read element, and a write element laminated in this order from the side of a slider. Insulating films isolate the constituent elements above from each other, and a protection film covers the group mentioned above. The heater is a thin film resistive element made of NiCr or the like, and is disposed above the insulating film. The electromagnetic shield is a magnetic film made of permalloy or the like, and covers the heater. The read element comprises a lower shield and electrode, a TMR element, and an upper shield and electrode. The write element comprises a lower magnetic pole piece, an upper magnetic pole piece, and a coil formed therebetween. The thin film head portion is formed with a common terminal.

A method and design for the fabrication of a laminated yoke for a high data rate magnetic read-write transducer head. A full film layer of first ferromagnetic material is formed on a base using either plating or sputtering. The base comprises a read head, a ferromagnetic pole piece, and a ferromagnetic shield which also serves as a pole piece. A patterned layer of first non-magnetic dielectric is then formed on the full film layer of first ferromagnetic material. A patterned layer of photoresist is then formed on the full film layer of first ferromagnetic material and the patterned non-magnetic dielectric and used as a frame for a frame plating deposition of a patterned layer of second ferromagnetic material. The full film layer of first ferromagnetic material and the non-magnetic dielectric are then patterned, using the patterned layer of second ferromagnetic material as a mask and ion beam etching.

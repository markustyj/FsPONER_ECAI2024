Thin-film magnetic recording heads and systems and processes for manufacturing the same are disclosed. In one embodiment, the invention is understood as a focused particle beam system that includes a pattern recognition element and that employs the pattern recognition element to image and analyze the pole-tip assembly footprint of a recording head and that employs a processor to generate instruction signals that direct a focused particle beam to remove selected portions of the recording head and thereby shape the pole-tip assembly of the recording head. The focused particle beam system provides a precision milling device that can employ the coordinate information to mill selectively the recording head and thereby shape the geometry of the pole-tip assembly footprint, including geometries that have contoured surfaces.

A thin film inductive transducer is shown comprising three magnetic layers (10, 11, 12) deposited on a slider substrate (13) for perpendicular recording of magnetic transitions on a movable magnetic medium. Two magnetic closures are provided. One is defined by electrical contact of one outer magnetic layer (12 or 10) with the intermediate magnetic layer (11 or 11') within the area bounded by conductive turns (a-h) of single layer coil (19 or 19'). The other is defined by electrical contact (10, 12 or 10', 12') outboard of the conductive turns (a-h). Magnetic transitions may be read by conventional peak detection techniques because the disclosed transducer has three pole tips (P1, P2, P3), the central one P2 of which is approximately 33-40% of the thickness of the outer pole tips (P1, P3). To avoid "wrap-around", the pole tips (P1, P2, P3) are progressively narrower in width as their distance from the substrate (13) increases.

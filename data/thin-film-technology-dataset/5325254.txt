A thin film magnetic head having a yoke structure comprising a pair of legs, a low reluctance back gap and a high reluctance front gap. The front gap is defined by the pole faces of pole tips which each have a cross-sectional area, in a plane paralleling the pole faces, for limiting magnetic saturation in the yoke structure to regions in the pole tip at and/or adjacent to the front gap. The pole tips define a short throat at the front gap to increase flux density at the gap and each yoke end face or pole tip has a thickness measured in the direction across the front gap which is greater than the thickness of either leg.

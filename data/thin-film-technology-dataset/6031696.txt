A thin-film magnetic head includes a recording gap layer, lower and upper magnetic pole layers deposited to sandwich the recording gap layer, the upper magnetic pole layer having side surfaces facing toward a track width direction, and non-magnetic conductive material members being in contact with at least a part of the respective side surfaces of the upper magnetic pole layer and in contact with the lower magnetic pole layer.

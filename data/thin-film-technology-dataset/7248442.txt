 A recording head for use in magnetic storage devices is disclosed. The recording head includes a transducer that is bi-directionally movable with respect to a magnetic medium surface of the magnetic storage medium, thereby enabling improved positioning of the transducer during read and write operations of the transducer. The recording head further includes a slider body and an interleaver assembly that is interposed between the transducer and the slider body. The interleaver assembly includes a flexure assembly having a plurality of resilient flexure beams. A motor assembly incorporated into the recording head can be selectively actuated to cause movement of the flexure assembly and corresponding movement of a portion of the interleaver assembly and the transducer body. The flexure assembly is configured to constrain motion of the transducer in vertical and horizontal directions with respect to the magnetic medium surface to allow for enhanced transducer positioning.

A method of manufacturing a thin film magnetic head including a first magnetic layer, a second magnetic layer, a gap layer, and a thin film coil consisting of one or more thin film coil layers. According to the method, the step of forming a first thin film coil layer of the thin film coil comprises, in succession, the steps of: forming a first inorganic insulating layer on a part of the first magnetic layer; forming coil-shaped recesses in the first insulating layer by a reactive ion etching such that the recesses have a width and a spacing which are equal to a width and a spacing of coil windings of the thin film coil layer to be formed and have a depth which is deeper than a height of the coil windings; depositing an electrically conductive material within the recesses by a chemical vapor deposition such that the recesses are completely filled with a deposited electrically conductive material and the surface of the first insulating layer is completely covered with the deposited electrically conductive material; polishing the deposited electrically conductive material such that coil windings are formed in the recesses and the surface of the first insulating layer is exposed to form a flat surface consisting of the exposed surface of the first insulating layer and upper surfaces of the coil windings; and forming a second insulating layer on the flat surface consisting of the exposed surface of the first insulating layer and the upper surfaces of the coil windings.

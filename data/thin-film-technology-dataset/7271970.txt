 A conventional magnetic head has a structure, in which a MR element and a recording element are stacked. The influence of a recording magnetic field on the magnetically sensitive portion of a reproduction element is lessened and the performance of the MR element is stabilized. Also, the reliability of the magnetic disk drive using a MR element is enhanced. The magnetic disk drive uses a composite magnet head, which has a plurality of reproduction elements arranged such that the magnetically sensitive layer of a reproduction element of the composite magnetic head does not overlap with the normal direction projection of the recording element, and which lessens the influence of a recording magnetic field on the magnetically sensitive portion of each reproduction element.

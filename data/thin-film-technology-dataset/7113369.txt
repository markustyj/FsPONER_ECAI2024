 In the head slider of the present invention, recording and reproducing electrode pads and heater electrode pads are attached to the same surface of an overcoat layer. The heater electrode pads are located on both sides of a group constituted by the recording and reproducing electrode pads. As a consequence, leads for the heater are located between respective leads for recording and reproducing head parts, whereby crosstalk can be prevented from occurring between the leads for the recording and reproducing head parts.

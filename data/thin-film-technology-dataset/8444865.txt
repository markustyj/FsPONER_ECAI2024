 A method for encapsulating a magnetic recording head including coating at least a portion of a magnetic recording head containing a recording gap with a first layer of at least one coating material, including silicon nitride, the first layer of at least one coating material having a first removal rate, coating at least a portion of the magnetic recording head containing a recording gap and coated with the first layer of at least one coating material with a second layer of at least one coating material, including aluminum oxide, the second layer of at least one coating material having a second removal rate higher than the first removal rate, and removing at least a portion of the second layer of at least one coating material via a removal process, including chemical-mechanical polishing, lapping, or vacuum processing to at least partially planarize the surface of the recording gap.

 A magnetic head according to one embodiment includes a side gap layer comprising primarily silicon nitride, wherein outer sides of the side gap layer taper away from one another from a leading end of the side gap layer towards a trailing end of the side gap layer; a seed layer above the silicon nitride side gap layer; and a magnetic pole on the seed layer. A method for forming a magnetic head according to one embodiment includes etching a channel in a silicon oxide layer; forming a side gap layer comprising primarily silicon nitride in the channel; forming a seed layer above the side gap layer; plating a pole on the seed layer; and removing the silicon oxide layer by wet etching. Additional systems and methods are also presented.

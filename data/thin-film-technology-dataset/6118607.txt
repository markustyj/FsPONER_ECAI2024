A method for eliminating wiggle noise in a disk drive storage device including a magnetic thin film head and a disk provided with an alternate servo sector and a data sector is characterized by the step of writing deliberately arbitrary data in a data sector following a servo sector where there has occurred an error caused by the wiggle noise during retrieving the servo information, thereby eliminating the wiggle noise.

In the method of making a thin-film magnetic head in accordance with the present invention, an electron beam resist is irradiated with electron beams in a state where an electrically conductive member is in contact with a magnetoresistive film. Since the magnetoresistive film electrically connects individual forming positions to be formed with magnetoresistive devices, charges stored near the forming positions upon irradiation with the electron beams can be drawn to the outside by way of the electrically conductive member. As a consequence, the electron beams are less likely to lose their rectilinearity, whereby the writing precision for patterning the magnetoresistive film by electron beam lithography can be improved.

A lapping sensor is provided for measuring a throat height of a thin film recording element during a mechanical lapping process. The recording element is fabricated in a photolithographic process and has a zero throat location. The lapping sensor includes a sensor device for generating an output signal indicative of the throat height during the lapping process, and a calibration switch in electrical communication with the sensor device. The switch is fabricated during the same photolithographic process as the recording element and generates an output signal during the lapping process indicative of a low resistance value up to a selected distance from the zero throat location of the recording element, and indicative of a high resistance value thereafter. Transition of the switch output signal from the low resistance value to the high resistance value during the lapping process is used to calibrate the sensor device output signal to the selected distance from the zero throat location of the recording element. A method for manufacturing the lapping sensor is also provided.

 A magnetoresistive thin-film magnetic head with high corrosion resistance for recording medium having massive capacity is provided by providing a protective film having a thickness of 40 .ANG. or less. Since the distance between the head and the medium is remarkably reduced, the film is suitable for a recording medium having high-packing density. The magnetoresistive type thin-film magnetic head is provided, wherein the following layers are formed on at least the surface of the head facing a recording medium: (A) a lower layer composed of a thin film having the composition represented by the formula selected from the group consisting of: formula (i): SiC.sub.XH.sub.YO.sub.ZN.sub.WF.sub.TB.sub.UP.sub.V (where X=0.5 26, Y=0.5 13, Z=0 6, W=0 6, T=0 6, U=0 1 and V=0 1, in terms of atomic ratio), and formula (ii): SiH.sub.YO.sub.ZN.sub.WF.sub.TB.sub.UP.sub.V (where Y=0.0001 0.7, Z=0 6, W=0 6, T=0 6, U=0 1 and V=0 1); and (B) an upper layer composed of a diamond-like thin film having the composition represented by the following formula: CH.sub.aO.sub.bN.sub.cF.sub.dB.sub.eP.sub.f (where a=0 0.7, b=0 1, c=0 1, d=0 1, e=0 1 and f=0 1), and the total thickness of the lower layer and the upper layer is 40 .ANG. or less. Also provided are a method for producing the same, and a magnetic head device using the same.

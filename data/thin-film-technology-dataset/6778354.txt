It is an object of the invention to provide a magnetic head in which coils can be miniaturized while shortening the manufacturing time and improve the yield, and a method of manufacturing the same. A coil is formed in a form of continuum in which a first winding unit wound clockwise around a bottom pole and a second winding unit wound counterclockwise around a top pole are alternatively coupled. If the number of turns of the coil is increased, spaces between each of coil parts become close. However, spaces between each of other coil parts are sufficiently kept apart. The former coil part is required to be formed with high precision while the latter coil parts do not require such precision. Therefore, portion of the thin film coil which requires high precision is reduced.

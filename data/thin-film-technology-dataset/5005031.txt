Magnetic recording apparatus for photographic still camera comprises a magnetic head mounted on a film platen to contact a magnetic coating on the film. A pressure pad on the opposite side of the film urges the film into contact with the head. The head is inclined transversely of the film to conform to the transverse film curl and is provided with angled surfaces to provide for better wrap of the film around the head and easier threading.

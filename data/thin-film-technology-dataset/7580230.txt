 A magnetoresistive sensor having a shape enhanced pinning and a flux guide structure. First and second hard bias layers and lead layers extend from the sides of a sensor stack. The hard bias layers and leads have a stripe height that is smaller than the stripe height of a free layer, resulting in a free layer that extends beyond the back edge of the lead and hard bias layer. This portion of the free layer that extends beyond the back edge of the leads and hard bias layers provides a back flux guide. Similarly, the sensor may have a free layer that extends beyond the front edge of the lead and hard bias layers to provide a front flux guide. The pinned layer extends significantly beyond the back edge of the free layer, providing the pinned layer with a strong shape enhanced magnetic anisotropy.

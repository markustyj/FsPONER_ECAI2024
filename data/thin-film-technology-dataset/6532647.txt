A manufacturing method of a composite type thin-film magnetic head with a reading head element and an inductive writing head element, includes a step of forming the reading head element and its lead conductor layers on a first insulation layer, a step of forming a second insulation layer to cover the reading head element and the lead conductor layers, a step of forming a second shield layer on the second insulation layer, a step of forming a third insulation layer, and a step of forming via holes and a back gap hole. The via holes and back gap hole forming step is executed by reactive ion etching (RIE) for simultaneously removing the second insulation layer and the third insulation layer located at the via holes and the third insulation layer located at the back gap hole.

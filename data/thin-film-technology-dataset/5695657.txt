A magneto-resistance effect type thin-film magnetic head for detecting reproduced signals by the magneto-resistance effect, which is suitable for detecting reproduced signals by magneto-resistance effects, is disclosed. The thin-film magnetic head includes a two-layered magneto-resistance effect element made up of a first magneto-resistance effect film and a second magneto-resistance effect film of substantially the same width as the first magneto-resistance effect film, layered with a non-magnetic insulating film in-between. Since the magneto-static coupling is produced between the first and second MR films, the magnetic state between the first and second MR films is stabilized. The film thickness contributing to the playback output can be reduced as in the case of a single-layer magnetic head constituted by a single-layer MR film for realizing a high playback output.

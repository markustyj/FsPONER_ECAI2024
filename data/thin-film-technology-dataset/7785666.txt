 A method and system for fabricating a magnetic recording device are described. The method and system include providing a mask layer on the magnetic recording device and imprinting a pattern in the mask layer to form a mask. The method and system also include transferring the pattern from the mask to the magnetic recording device. In another aspect, the method and system include providing a malleable mask layer on the magnetic recording device. In this aspect, the method and system also include depressing an imprint mask into the mask layer and curing the mask layer while the imprint mask is depressed into the mask layer to provide a mask having a pattern. The pattern may correspond to a read sensor and/or a perpendicular magnetic recording pole. The method and system also include transferring the pattern from the mask to the magnetic recording device.

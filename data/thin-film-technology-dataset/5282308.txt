A method for fabricating a thin film magnetic head assembly including the procedure of hardening a portion of the upper pole-tip photoresist mask to create a planarizing stitching pedestal in the region where the upper pole-tip overlaps with the upper pole-yoke. The upper pole assembly is deposited in two steps to create a stitched pole consisting of an upper pole-tip joined to an upper pole-yoke element at the stitching pedestal. The method reduces process complexity by eliminating masking steps and also eliminates the usual close alignment requirements for upper insulation and pole-yoke deposition procedures, thereby improving process yield.

A thin film magnetic head comprising a magnetic core of accumulation layers forming a magnetic circuit and including at least two layers of magnetic film with a particular magnetic characteristic. The constitution of completely covering a magnetic film with a small pattern by a magnetic film with a large pattern makes the edge part smooth because the end of the underlying magnetic film is covered with the upper magnetic film. This edge-smoothing effect appears most pronounced in a manufacturing method in which electrodeposition is used for the formation of magnetic films. By sequentially forming the magnetic films from that of a smaller pattern towards that of a larger pattern, the film formation proceeds at step parts such as end parts of the underlying magnetic films due to the levelling action which is inherent in the electrodeposition method. Such a film formation realizes extremely smooth shielding and yet the pattern formation can be carried out by a single step of photoresist coating to shorten the production process.

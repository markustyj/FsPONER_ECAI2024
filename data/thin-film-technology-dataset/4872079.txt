A thin film magnetic head having a substrate, a magnetic head and a superstrate formed of materials which are highly resistive to being abraded by a magnetic media being moved thereacross is shown. The magnetic head includes a bottom pole piece having a front gap section and a rearwardly extending portion positioned at predetermined locations on the substrate. The bottom pole piece forms a bottom support for a coil having a plurality of coil windings. An insulating structure having a thin gap defining section and a thick coil windings enclosing portion is located on the bottom pole piece such that the thin gap defining portion establishes the thickness of a magnetic transducing gap and the thick coil windings enclosing portion encloses and surrounds that portion of the coil windings supported by the bottom pole piece. A magnetic top pole piece layer having a front gap portion, a contoured outer surface having a step formed therein, and a rear magnetic closure portion is positioned with the front gap section thereof on the thin gap defining portion of the insulating structure located on the front gap section of the bottom pole piece. The top pole piece extends from the transducing gap rearward to a rear magnetic closure section to enclose that portion of the coil windings located between the top pole piece and the bottom pole piece. A leveler layer is positioned on top of the top pole piece to support a superstrate.

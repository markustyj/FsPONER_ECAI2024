A read while write dual bump tape head for increasing allowable linear and areal bit density comprises first and second thin-film inductive write heads. The first thin film, inductive write head has a first top pole and a first shared pole. The first shared pole is patterned such that it has a width at a tape bearing surface of the dual bump tape head narrower than a width of the first top pole at the tape bearing surface. The second thin-film inductive head has a second top pole and a second shared pole. The second shared pole is patterned such that it has a width at the tape bearing surface narrower than a width of the second top pole at the tape bearing surface.

A method of eliminating a wiggle noise generated by a data write current applied to a thin-film head during a data write operation in a disk drive storage apparatus having a storage medium on which data is recorded, the method comprising the step of: on occurrence of any read error owing to the wiggle noise, causing the head to perform a dummy write operation onto a given one of one or more intersector gap intervals in a corresponding track on the storage medium; and retrying a data read operation, subsequent to searching a target sector, the data read operation being repeated by predetermined retry times if the read error is continuously detected on the data read operation.

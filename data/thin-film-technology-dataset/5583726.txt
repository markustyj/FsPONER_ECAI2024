A magneto-resistive (MR) head has an MR layer in a space formed by shield layers by providing a distance enough to protect magnetic flux, flowing through the MR layer from a recording medium through a gap formed by the shield layers, from leaking out to the shield layers. A flux guide is provided between the MR layer and the gap and has an end magnetically connected to the MR extending over an effective area of the MR head, and another end having a width a little narrower than a width of track of the recording medium. A side of the MR layer, opposite to the side connected with the flux guide layer is placed in a narrow space formed at a corner of the space. Magnetic flux leaked from the gap due to a sense current flowing through the MR layer is eliminated by making a current flow through a recording coil layer or through an electrically conductive layer placed in the space.

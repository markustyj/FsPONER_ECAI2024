A thin film magnetic transducer having a magnetic circuit having nickel-iron layers which encloses a portion of first and second windings. The portions of each winding traversing the nickel-iron layers have conductor segments equal in number and separated from each other in parallel planes. The conductor segments of each winding have a center-to-center spacing different from the remaining winding selected to avoid contact with the transition regions of the nickel-iron layers and which results in a common inductance for each winding. The windings are joined at one end to form a center tapped winding.

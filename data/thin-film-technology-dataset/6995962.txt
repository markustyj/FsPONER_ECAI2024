 There is provided a magnetoresistance effect element including a first pinned ferromagnetic layer, a second pinned ferromagnetic layer facing the first pinned ferromagnetic layer, surface regions of the first and second pinned ferromagnetic layer facing each other being different from each other in composition, a free ferromagnetic layer intervening between the first and second pinned ferromagnetic layers, a first tunnel barrier layer intervening between the first pinned ferromagnetic layer and the free ferromagnetic layer, and a second tunnel barrier layer intervening between the second pinned ferromagnetic layer and the free ferromagnetic layer.

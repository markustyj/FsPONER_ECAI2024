A thin film magnetic read/write head deposited upon a non-magnetic substrate reduces leading edge undershoots in readback pulse signal. A magnetic layer is deposited between the thin film magnetic read/write head and the non-magnetic substrate. Undershoots are reduced by making the leading edge of the thin film head less sensitive to the magnetization transitions in a magnetic storage medium.

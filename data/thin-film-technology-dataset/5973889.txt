Single-channel magnetic head having a head face (1) which extends in a first direction (I) in which a magnetic record carrier (3) is relatively movable with respect to the magnetic head, and in a second direction (II) transverse to the first direction. The magnetic head has a structure of layers which, viewed in the first direction, are situated one on top of the other and extend substantially in the second direction and a third direction (III) transverse to the first and the second direction. The structure is provided with a magnetoresistive measuring element (5), a first magnetic element (7) and a second magnetic element (9). Both magnetic elements are electrically conducting, while the measuring element is arranged electrically in series between the two magnetic elements for passing a measuring current (i) through the measuring element substantially in the third direction. Each magnetic element has an electric contact face (7a, 9a). To obtain a stable single-channel magnetic head having a narrow, well-defined scanning width, at least one magnetic element extending as far as the head face has an extensiveness which is larger in the second direction than in the third direction. This extensiveness in the second direction is also larger than the effective width (w) of the measuring element. In the third direction, the relevant magnetic element has a larger relative magnetic permeability (.mu..sub.rIII) than in the second direction.

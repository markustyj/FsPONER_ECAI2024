 In a magnetic disk device, cost reduction is designed by improving productivity, and increase in recording density and increase in capacity of the device or size reduction are designed with reliability being ensured. In one embodiment, a magnetic disk device has a magnetic disk arranged rotatably, a magnetic head slider arranged in a manner of facing a surface of the magnetic disk, and a driving device for moving the magnetic head slider in a radial direction of the surface of the magnetic disk. The magnetic head slider has a silicon slider-substrate-portion and a thin-film head portion which is formed on the slider substrate portion using a thin-film process and forms an air-bearing surface along with the slider substrate portion. The thin-film head portion has recording/reproduction elements facing the surface of the magnetic disk, and a ceramic insulation film has alumina and silicon-based ceramics in order to have a coefficient of linear expansion approximately equal to that of the silicon slider-substrate-portion.

A magnetic reading head having a magnetoresistive element which is connected to a reading amplifier. In order to reduce the modulation noise (Barkhausen effect) when making the relationship between the resistance variation and the strength of the signal field linear in a negative feedback loop of the reading amplifier an electric turn is present which turn is positioned relative to the magnetoresistive element in such manner that a negative feedback field (Ht) can be generated with it which causes a magnetic flux in the element which is directed oppositely to the magnetic flux caused in the element by a magnetic field (H.sub.y) to be detected.

A still camera usable with film having a recording medium for recording optical information obtained by photographing and various magnetic information loaded in the camera body comprises a magnetic head for recording the magnetic information on the recording medium with movement of the film, a magnetic head driving device for selectively moving the magnetic head to a position retracted from the film surface and a position urged against the film surface, a discriminating device for discriminating between a one-frame photographing mode and a continuous photographing mode, and a control device for controlling the magnetic head driving device according to the photographing mode. With the one-frame mode, the magnetic head is urged against the film surface after termination of photographing to record magnetic information and is then moved to the retracted position after termination of one-frame movement of the film. With the continuous mode, the magnetic head is urged against the film surface after termination of photographing to thereby record the magnetic information, and it is held in the urged position after termination of one-frame movement until a continuous photographing signal is released.

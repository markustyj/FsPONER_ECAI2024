A slider element includes a thin film transducer deposited onto a slider along at least one of the rails forming the flying air bearing surface with a magnetic media. A portion of the end tips of the pole pieces and gap of the thin film inductive transducer and a portion of the slider rail adjacent to the transducer is etched by a sputter etching process. A layer of a passivation material such as chromium is sputter deposited into the etched portion such that the leading portion of the rail protects the passivation material from wear. The passivation material over the pole tips of the transducer prevents the corrosion of the iron-nickel alloy comprising the pole tips.

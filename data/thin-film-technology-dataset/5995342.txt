A low-noise toroidal thin film head ("TFH") device has low coil resistance and inductance, especially suitable for very high magnetic recording areal densities and channel frequencies. The length of a toroidal coil turn is only about 20-30% that of the length of an average turn in the conventional planar spiral coil design. This allows either reduction of the device thermal noise (by about 6 dB) and/or increase of the device operational frequency bandwidth (by a factor of 3-5). The toroidal coil coupling efficiency between each turn and the magnetic core is practically 100%, thereby improving the write and read-back efficiencies. In one embodiment a non-via large back-closure contact area is provided between the bottom and top magnetic poles along their entire back-side width, and all other open branches and loose ends in the magnetic circuit are eliminated. The magnetic core has a gradual, smooth toroidal (or a horse-shoe) shape with no loose ends, nooks, crevices, or sharp corners. The larger back-closure contact area decreases the magnetic core reluctance and improves the device efficiency. Utilization of a soft non-magnetic seed-layer, such as gold, eliminates interference noise due to the conventional magnetic (NiFe) seed-layer. Slight mechanical texturing (scratching) of the seed-layer along the intended easy axis helps to define and induce strong magnetic uniaxial anisotropy in the plated magnetic poles. All these features facilitate significant reduction of Barkhausen and other sources of device noise. Embodiments include conventional TFH's, Planar TFH's, Pinched-Gap TFH's, and various versions of Magnetoresistive (MR) TFH's.

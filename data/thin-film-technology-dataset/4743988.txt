A thin-film magnetic head is disclosed wherein a first core portion includes an insulative island of inorganic material. A first coil section is formed in the island so that it presents a flat common surface with the island and substrate. A gap-forming insulating layer is on the first coil section and the first core portion. A second core portion is on the gap-forming layer, forming a magnetic circuit with the first core portion. A second coil section is connected to the first coil section to form a coil therewith. In a modification, the head comprises a nonmagnetic substrate in which a coil section is formed to present a flat common surface. Metallic ferromagnetic material is used to form core portions on the coil section.

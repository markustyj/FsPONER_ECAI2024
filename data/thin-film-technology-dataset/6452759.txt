The present invention provides a yoke type magnetoresistive (MR) composite thin film head having no other gap than the recording/reproducing gap so as to increase the recording characteristics and reproduction characteristics. A magnetic gap 70 is formed between a front portion of an upper pole 6 and a front portion of a lower pole 1, whereas a rear portion of the upper pole 6 and a rear portion of the lower pole 1 are magnetically connected to form a magnetic flux path. A mesa pattern 2 is provided apart from the magnetic gap 70 and a magnetoresistive element (MR pattern) 3 is arranged on a front slope 2a of the mesa pattern 2. The upper pole 6 and the lower pole 1 are magnetically bridged via the MR element 3, so as to form a separate magnetic flux flow path via the MR element 3. This separate magnetic flux flow path is used for reproduction of a magnetic recording information. A write-in coil is arranged on the mesa pattern 2. The upper pole 6 and the lower pole 1 have no gap in the midst of the poles, increasing the ratio of generation of the recording magnetic field. A lead pattern 3a is derived from the front slope 2a and via a side slope 2b.

 A method and system for fabricating a microelectric device are described. A write pole of an energy assisted magnetic recording head or a capacitor might be fabricated. The method includes depositing a resist film and curing the resist film at a temperature of at least 180 degrees centigrade. A cured resist film capable of supporting a line having an aspect ratio of at least ten is thus provided. A portion of the cured resist film is removed. A remaining portion of the resist film forms the line. An insulating or nonmagnetic layer is deposited after formation of the line. The line is removed to provide a trench in the insulating or nonmagnetic layer. The trench has a height and a width. The height divided by the width corresponds to the aspect ratio. At least part of the structure is provided in the trench.

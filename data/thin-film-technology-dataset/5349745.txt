A method of fabricating a thin-film magnetic in which a mask pattern in etching a bottom pole is formed of first and second mask films in this order when viewed from the bottom pole, the first mask film is used for defining, by self-alignment, the length of that portion of the side edge of a top pole which is nearly perpendicular to a magnetic gap, the second mask film makes it possible to etch the bottom pole with high dimensional accuracy, a non-magnetic film is formed on the mask pattern having the bottom pole thereunder and the exposed region of a substrate, and the top pole is formed after the mask pattern has been exposed and removed.

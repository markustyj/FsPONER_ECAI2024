Multi-track magnetic thin film heads for recording and reproducing an analog signal of an electronic still camera. The heads are constructed on a single non-magnetic substrate. Each of lower magnetic cores for the heads is separately formed in the surface of the non-magnetic substrate, in order to reduce cross talk from adjacent tracks. Further, in order to decrease a resistance of a coil thereof, a distance of back head gap parts of adjacent heads is formed larger than a distance of front head gap parts of the adjacent heads. As the non-magnetic substrate, a ceramic material comprising at least MnO and NiO are used, as a magnetic core material, an amorphous material including Co, Nb and Zr is used, and as a magnetic gap material, Cr or Zr is used.

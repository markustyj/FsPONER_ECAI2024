In a magnetoresistance thin film magnetic head, a bias conductor and a magnetoresistive magnetic sensing section are electrically connected to each other in series. Further, the bias conductor (7) is formed in such a pattern as to have a width and distance from a magnetic recording medium facing surface which become larger as it is away from a portion transversing the magnetoresistive magnetic sensing section.

A method of lapping the air bearing surface of a magnetoresistive head which minimizes the likelihood of interelement shorts at the air bearing surface is described. In a final, linear lapping phase, the air bearing surface is lapped back and forth parallel to the longitudinal axis of the head elements in an oscillatory path across a stationary lapping surface. Any scratches or smears of the elements will be along the length of the elements rather than transverse to the elements. Any transverse scratches or smears occurring in earlier lapping phases will be removed during the linear lapping phase.

A magnetic head device of thin-film type having superior recording and reproducing characterisics. The magnetic head device has a non-magnetic substrate and lower and upper magnetic layers formed on the substrate. At least one of the magnetic layers has a double-layered structure composed of two soft magnetic layers. One of these soft magnetic layers, which is disposed at the inner side of the magnetic circuit, has a coercive force smaller than that of the other soft magnetic layer. The soft magnetic layer having the greater coercive force, at least at a portion thereof contactable with the recording medium, has a greater width than the soft magnetic layer of the smaller coercive force as viewed in the direction of the track.

A thin-film magnetic head includes an ABS and a three-layer pole tip structure located between the ABS and a position at a predetermined height from the ABS. The structure consists of a first pole, a recording gap layer and a second pole. The recording gap layer is made of a material having a etching rate equal to or higher than that of a material for making the first and second poles.

One aspect of the invention is a method of flux conduction comprising providing a structure with anisotropy not purely in the transverse in-plane direction such that flux spreading into the transverse in-plane direction can occur by rotation. Apparatus includes a thin film magnetic recording device having at least one pole with two magnetic layers and capable of conducting signal flux, a first of the magnetic layers having domains oriented in a first direction, a second of said magnetic layers having domains oriented in a second distinct direction, the layers coupled to each other such that signal flux can flow therebetween. Method of making and various embodiments disclosed.

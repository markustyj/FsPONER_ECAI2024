A slider (34) for reading data from a disk surface (80), the slider (80) including a magneto-resistive head (36). The head (36) includes a transducer (58) having a stack of layers (59), each layer (62,66,70,74) having a proximal end (64,68,72,76) proximal to the disk surface, and a pair of electrical leads (82), connected to the transducer (58), each one of the electrical leads (82) also having a proximal end (83) proximal to the disk surface (80). At least one of the proximal ends (83) of the electrical leads (82) and the layers (66) is recessed to provide one or more recessed areas (92). The recessed areas (92) are then filled with protective material (94) to a depth such that when the layer of protective material (48) is worn from the proximal ends (64,68,72,76,83) by burnishing by the disk surface (80), protective material (94) still remains in the recessed areas (92). Also disclosed is a method of fabrication of a slider (80) having recessed areas (92) filled with protective material (92) which protect materials from corrosion and electrical spiking.

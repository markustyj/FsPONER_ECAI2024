The present invention pertains to a thin film magnetic recording head which minimizes erase fringing and the process for manufacturing the thin film magnetic recording head. The head is used to record and read information made up of alternating magnetization patterns on a magnetic recording medium. Known recording heads cause erase fringing of the magnetic medium during the write operations. The structure of the recording head of the present invention has the ABS portion of one of two magnetic poles beveled away from ABS at the gap to zero throat, reduces erase fringing of the magnetic recording medium and is easily manufactured. By reducing erase fringing, the present invention enables an increase in disk density of information without risking loss of data integrity.

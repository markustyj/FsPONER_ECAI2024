 Closer spacing of elements for writing multiple tracks onto a magnetic media increases the areal density of stored information. A thin film multiple track recording head includes recording gaps in a plane parallel with the head substrate. This configuration allows for flexible placement of the elements within the head, improved control of recording gap geometry, and alternating azimuth gap angles.

A thin film structure suitable for use as a shield for a read element of a transducing head has a first ferromagnetic layer, a second ferromagnetic layer, a spacer layer and a bias layer. The spacer layer is positioned between the first ferromagnetic layer and the second ferromagnetic layer. The bias layer is positioned adjacent the first ferromagnetic layer. A product of a thickness of the first ferromagnetic layer and a magnetic moment of the first ferromagnetic layer is substantially equal to a product of a thickness of the second ferromagnetic layer and a magnetic moment of the second ferromagnetic layer. An easy axis of the first ferromagnetic layer is substantially parallel to an easy axis of the second ferromagnetic layer.

Audio to be recorded in a photographic film camera in association with individual exposed frames is first digitized and stored in a temporary storage memory in the camera allowing playback through a speaker mounted in the camera to permit playback review and editing, as needed. When the film is advanced in the camera to the next exposure frame, the digital audio signal is recorded on a magnetic layer formed on the film. At the photofinisher, the digital audio signal is read and converted to suitable encodement format, such as bar code or binary coded blister marks which are impressed on the photoprint for subsequent playback.

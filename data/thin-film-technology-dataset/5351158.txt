A magnetoresistance-effect thin film head including a substrate, a magnetic field sensing element provided on the substrate, an electrode layer having portions respectively extending from the opposite ends of the magnetic field sensing element to apply a sense current to the magnetic field sensing element so that the sense current will flow in the direction of a signal magnetic field, an insulating layer formed over the magnetic field sensing element, a bias magnetic field creating conductor formed on the insulating layer so as to extend across the magnetic field sensing element, and a magnetic shielding layer shielding the magnetic field sensing element. At least a portion of the electrode layer and a portion of the bias magnetic field creating conductor are included in a conductive pattern.

An object of the invention is to provide a thin film magnetic head and a magnetic transducer, which can obtain resistance properties adaptable to ultra-high-density recording. The thin film magnetic head has a stack including a plurality of magnetic layers stacked alternately with a plurality of nonmagnetic layers. The stack is divided into a first region and a second region in a direction of stacking. The first region comprises a projecting portion projecting toward a magnetic medium, an extending portion extending in the direction opposite to the projecting portion, and a pair of wide portions widened in the direction perpendicular to the direction in which the extending portion extends. An end surface of the projecting portion is exposed to the outside and faces the magnetic medium. Thus, the end surface functions as a magnetic field capturing portion for capturing a signal magnetic field of the magnetic medium. The stack has the projecting portion, and the projecting portion functions as the magnetic field capturing portion. Thus, the number of layers of the stack can be increased without increasing a length of a surface facing the magnetic medium. Therefore, the rate of resistance change and the resistance can be increased.

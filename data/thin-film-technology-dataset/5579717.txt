According to the present grinding method, a plurality of optical markers are formed by photolithography such that the markers are embedded in a chiplet having a magnetic head. Markers are preferably in the shape of a bar having predetermined height, width and length and are spaced from each other by a predetermined distance where one end of the bars are sequentially offset from each other by a predetermined amount. During coarse grinding of the magnetic head as the magnetic head surface material is ground away, the end-face of the bars, one at a time, become visible. The closer the grinding surface approaches the desired inductive throat or MR element height, more end-faces become visible. Coarse grinding continues until a predetermined number of end-faces become visible at which point the grinding process is terminated and the magnetic head is ready for the final lapping process.

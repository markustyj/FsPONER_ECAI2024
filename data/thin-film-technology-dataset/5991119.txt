A proximity magnetoresistive head slider and method of making the same are disclosed. The head slider includes a slider body having an air bearing surface (ABS). An inductive write transducer is formed at a first portion of the ABS. A cavity is formed in the slider body such that a first surface of the cavity forms a second portion of the ABS which is out of plane with the first portion of the ABS. A magnetoresistive (MR) read transducer is positioned in the cavity at the first surface such that the MR read transducer is recessed relative to the inductive write transducer, thereby preventing contact between the MR read transducer and a surface of a disc.

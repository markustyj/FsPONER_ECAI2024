A thin film magnetic head adapted for recording and/or reproducing signals at a frequency of 1 MHz or higher, in which a soft magnetic film having uniaxial magnetic anisotropy is used as a magnetic pole film material and the direction of the magnetic path of the magnetic circuit of the head is arranged to be substantially orthogonal to the axis of easy magnetization, wherein a magnetic pole film constituting the magnetic path is formed as a lamination of at least two, particularly four soft magnetic films, with an intervening nonmagnetic film between the adjacent soft magnetic films, the length W of the magnetic pole film along the direction of the axis of easy magnetization is 30 .mu.m.ltoreq.W.ltoreq.300 .mu.m, and the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy constant Ku is Ku.ltoreq.300 J/m.sup.3. This provides a relative permeance of at least 1000.

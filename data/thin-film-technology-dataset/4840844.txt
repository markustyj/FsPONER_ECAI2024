A magnetic recording medium which comprises a non-magnetic substrate, a magnetic film formed on the substrate and a protective film provided on the magnetic film, the protective film being composed of at least two groups of element, the element in one group being at least one of B and C having a smaller atomic size, and a concentration of the element increasing from the interface side of the protective film with the magnetic film toward the opposite face side throughout the protective film has an improved durability against a magnetic head.

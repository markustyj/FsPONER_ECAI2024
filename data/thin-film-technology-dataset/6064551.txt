The present invention provides a high quality magnetoresistance effect type magnetic head having an increased reproduction output and capable of applying a uniform bias magnetic field to a magnetoresistance effect layer without increasing an impedance. The magnetoresistance effect type magnetic head according to the present invention includes: a magnetic layer 11 magnetized approximately in a vertical direction to a plane 14 opposing to a magnetic recording medium; a non-magnetic insulation layer 12 formed on the magnetic layer 11; and a magnetoresistance effect layer 13 formed on the non-magnetic insulation layer 12 and exhibiting the magnetoresistance effect. In the longitudinal type magnetoresistance effect type magnetic head according to the present, the detection current supplied to a magnetoresistance element is prevented from flowing into a hard magnetic film to lower the head reproduction output.

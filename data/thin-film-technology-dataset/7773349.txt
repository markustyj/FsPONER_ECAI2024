 In a CPP MR device such as a tunnel magnetoresistive (TMR) device, shoulders that have a magnetic moment that is matched to the magnetic moments of the free layer extend between the free layer and the S2 shield to provide an electrical path from one shoulder, through the shield, to the other shoulder for dissipating edge charges. Thus, a CPP MR device may include a seed stack, a pinned stack on the seed stack, and a tunnel barrier on the pinned stack. A free stack may be on the tunnel barrier, and the free stack can include a free sublayer separated from a magnetic shield and a path for dissipating edge charges in the free stack through the magnetic shield.

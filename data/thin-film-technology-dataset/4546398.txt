A perpendicular magnetic recording and reproducing head, including: a spiral coil of at least one electrically conductive thin film; and a main pole of a first thin magnetic film having an end for recording and reproducing information, the main pole and the spiral coil being electromagnetically coupled to each other. A perpendicular magnetic head such as this can be easily manufactured, can be adapted not only to floppy disks but also to rigid disks, is suitable for high-frequency operation, and has an improved recording/reproducing efficiency.

A magnetic converter having a magnetoresistive element, the resistance of which is measured by means of an alternating current having a frequency which is larger than 8.rho./.mu.D, where .rho. is the resistivity, .mu. the magnetic permeability and D the cross-section of the element so that the current distribution is concentrated at the edges of the element due to the resultant lateral skin effect.

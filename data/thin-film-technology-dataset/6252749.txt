A thin film magnetic head comprises a lower gap layer composed of an adhesion layer formed of Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 or the like, an AlN film having a high thermal conductivity and a protective layer formed of Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 or the like. Since the lower gap layer comprises the AlN film, it has an extremely high thermal conductivity as compared to conventional equivalents. Accordingly, heat generated from a magnetroresistive element layer can be escaped through the lower gap layer to a lower shield layer so as to inhibit the temperature of element from elevating and to obtain a satisfactory regeneration sensitivity.

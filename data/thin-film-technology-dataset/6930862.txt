An extraordinary magnetoresistance (EMR) magnetic head is provided including a first shield and a second shield defining a gap adapted for being positioned over a magnetic recording disk. An EMR sensor is positioned between the first shield and the second shield. In order to ensure proper operation of the EMR sensor, a plane in which the EMR sensor is positioned is perpendicular to magnetic flux associated with the magnetic recording disk.

A thin film magnetic structure for use as a flux guide in a magnetic recording system has tapered edges transverse to the magnetization axis of the film. The tapered edges eliminate magnetic edge domains and thereby assure a single magnetic domain in the film structure. Thus, Barkhausen noise is essentially eliminated from the signal read by the film structure from the magnetic recording medium.

A device for keeping a magnetic head for reading and/or writing magnetic information in precise position with respect to a magnetic surface of a film. A lever, one end of which is provided with a balancer and the other end of which is rotatably provided with a support plate, is rotatably mounted on a frame of an apparatus in which a film having a magnetic surface is used. On the support plate are mounted a magnetic head and a pair of pins located on both sides of the magnetic head with respect to a direction in which the film is fed. A pivot at which the lever is rotatably mounted on the frame of the apparatus is positioned in the vicinity of a center of gravity of the total system including the lever, the balancer and the support plate having the magnetic head and the pins. In the apparatus is provided a coil spring by which the lever is biased to the direction in which the pins are contacted with the edge extending longitudinally of the film. When an impulse is exerted on the apparatus to move it in a direction, there is no occurrence of rotational momentum of the lever around the pivot thereof.

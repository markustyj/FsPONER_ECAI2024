The seed-layer, or metallization layer, used to form the coil winding in a thin film head (TFH) by electrodeposition, is removed from between individual winding turns by selective etching with an etchant which preferentially, or selectively, attacks the seed-layer while leaving the coil winding, insulation, and gap materials essentially intact. A suitable combination of compatible materials which can be used as the seed-layer, coil winding, and etchant, respectively, in practicing this invention comprises nickel-iron Permalloy, copper, and a mixture of nitric acid and phosphoric acid diluted in pure water. Other combinations of materials and types of etching processes suitable for this invention are also disclosed.

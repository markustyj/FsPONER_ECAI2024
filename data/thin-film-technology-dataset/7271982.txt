 A method for forming a perpendicular magnetic recording head using an air-bearing surface damascene process and perpendicular magnetic recording head formed thereby is disclosed. The perpendicular head is formed by depositing a pseudo trailing shield layer over a pole layer and selectively etching the pseudo trailing shield layer to a depth equal to a desired trailing shield throat height. Then, a magnetic material is deposited in the resulting void.

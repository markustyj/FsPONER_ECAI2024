A thin film magnetic head incorporates an inductive write portion including two pole/shield layers and a read portion including a giant magnetoresistive (GMR) element. The pole/shield layers are relatively thick and serve as conductive leads which can carry high current with minimal heating and low current density. The GMR element defines data track width and thus minimizes off-track reading of data.

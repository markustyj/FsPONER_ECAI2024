Provided are a magnetic transducer, a thin film magnetic head and a method of manufacturing the same which can improve efficiency of heat dissipation.An MR element functioning as a magnetic transducer including: a nonmagnetic metal layer; a free layer formed on one surface of the nonmagnetic metal layer; a pinned layer formed on the other surface of the nonmagnetic metal layer; and an antiferromagnetic layer formed on a surface of the pinned layer, the surface being opposite to a surface in contact with the nonmagnetic metal layer. One end face of the free layer, the nonmagnetic metal layer, the pinned layer and the antiferromagnetic layer forms a medium facing surface forming a surface facing an external magnetic field. A tapered surface inclined to the medium facing surface is formed on the end face opposite to the medium facing surface of a stack comprising the free layer, the nonmagnetic metal layer, the pinned layer and the antiferromagnetic layer. A distance between the medium facing surface of the antiferromagnetic layer and the opposite face is longer than a distance between the medium facing surface of the free layer and the opposite face. Thus, a sufficient amount of heat dissipation from the antiferromagnetic layer can be ensured. Therefore, heating of the magnetic transducer can be prevented.

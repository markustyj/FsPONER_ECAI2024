A magnetic head having an elongate magnetoresistive element bearing a pattern of equipotential strips extending obliquely to its longitudinal axis for adjusting a suitable workpoint. With its edges extending parallel to the longitudinal axis, the element bears on components of magnetically permeable material one of which, in operation, is in direct flux coupling with a magnetic recording medium and the other of which is in flux coupling with the recording medium via a further element of magnetically permeable material which may be ferrite.

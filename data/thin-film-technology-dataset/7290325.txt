 According to one aspect, an exemplary method for manufacturing a magnetic head includes forming a plurality of magnetoresistive devices, a reference device, and a monitoring device, where the reference device includes a desired stripe height less than the magnetoresistive devices and monitoring device. Material is removed from the air/tape bearing surface, e.g., by lapping, thereby reducing the stripe height of the magnetoresistive devices and monitoring device. A characteristic of the reference device, e.g., resistance, voltage, or the like, is compared with a similar characteristic of the monitoring device, wherein the characteristic of the monitoring device varies as material is removed. Material may be removed from the bearing surface until the characteristic of the monitoring device and the reference device are substantially equal, at which time, the stripe height of the monitoring device and magnetoresistive devices are substantially equal to that of the reference device.

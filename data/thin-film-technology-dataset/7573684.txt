 An apparatus comprises a first current-in-plane sensor, a first magnetic field source for biasing the first current-in-plane sensor in a first direction, a second current-in-plane sensor positioned parallel to the first current-in-plane sensor, a second magnetic field source for biasing the second current-in-plane sensor in a second direction, and first and second electrodes for supplying sense current to the first and second current-in-plane sensors.

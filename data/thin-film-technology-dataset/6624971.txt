Disclosed are a thin film magnetic head which realizes an accurate control of a pole width and a sufficient overwrite characteristic even when the pole width is narrowed and a method of manufacturing the same. The throat height zero (TH0) position is defined by an edge face of a top pole tip formed on a flat face. The TH0 position can be accurately determined upon formation of the top pole tip, so that the throat height which contributes to the recording characteristic of a thin film magnetic head can be determined with high precision. The top pole tip and the top pole are magnetically coupled to each other with a sufficient contact area by two connection portions which are separated from each other in the width direction. Thus, a magnetic flux propagation loss caused by a magnetic flux saturation which occurs when a magnetic flux flows from a region of a large magnetic volume into a region of a small magnetic volume can be reduced.

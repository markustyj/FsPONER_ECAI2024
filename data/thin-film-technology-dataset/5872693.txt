A thin-film magnetic head comprising a lower magnetic core formed on a substrate, an upper magnetic core formed on the lower magnetic core with a magnetic gap therebetween, and a coil interposed between the lower magnetic core and the upper magnetic core as insulated from the lower magnetic core and the upper magnetic core, characterized in that at least either of the lower magnetic core and the upper magnetic core comprises a front body of a magnetic pole facing a magnetic recording medium and a rear body of a magnetic pole having part thereof superposed on the front body of the magnetic pole, the rear body of the magnetic pole is disposed as recessed from the head surface facing the medium and held in contact with the front body of the magnetic pole in a plane, the plane is terminated at a rear of the end of the front body of the magnetic pole, and the rear body of the magnetic pole has a shape curved or bent in the direction opposite to the magnetic gap, and further the front body of the magnetic pole is composed of a magnetic member embedded in a trench formed in advance in an insulating layer.

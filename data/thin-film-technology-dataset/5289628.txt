A method of producing a thin film magnetic head in which at least one of two, lower and upper, magnetic layers is formed of a soft magnetic amorphous alloy thin film of a given pattern shape, includes the steps of preparing a soft magnetic thin film to communicate directly or magnetically with the soft magnetic amorphous alloy thin film so that an external magnetic field can effectively be applied, during in-field heat treatment, to the soft magnetic amorphous alloy thin film of the head core assembly from a direction at a right angle to the direction of a head core magnetic path, inducing uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in the soft magnetic amorphous alloy thin film through heat treatment in the external magnetic field, and removing the soft magnetic thin film for application of the external magnetic field during the in-field heat treatment. Also, another form of the method in which at least one of two, lower and upper, magnetic layers is formed by electroplating of a soft magnetic alloy thin film of a given pattern shape, includes the steps of preparing a soft magnetic thin film to communicate directly or magnetically with the soft magnetic electroplated alloy thin film so that an external magnetic field can effectively be applied, during in-field electroplating action, to the soft magnetic electroplated alloy thin film of the head core assembly from a direction at a right angle to the direction of a head core magnetic path.

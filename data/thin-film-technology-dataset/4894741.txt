To provide optimized performance in a magneto-resistive head having a soft adjacent magnetic biasing layer separated from a current-carrying magneto-resistive sense film by an extremely thin electrically insulating film, the invention provides that the soft adjacent magnetic biasing layer be comprised of a magnetically soft layer of high electrical resistivity, whereby the effect of pinholes in the electrically insulating film is significantly lessened.

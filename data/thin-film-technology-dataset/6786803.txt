An onboard electronic lapping guide for lapping a magneto-resistive head having a magneto-resistive sensor element disposed for electrical communication with a pair of sensor electrical leads. The lapping guide includes an electronic lapping guide resistive element disposed for electrical communication with the sensor electrical leads. The resistive element has a predetermined height in a lapping direction and is adapted to produce an electrical resistance in the presence of a lapping current that increases as said resistive element height is reduced during lapping. A lapping method and a method of forming the onboard electronic lapping guide are also disclosed.

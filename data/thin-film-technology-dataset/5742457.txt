An inductive-write magnetoresistive-read horizontal head for magnetic recording having two polarization conductors. The two polarization conductors are used to simultaneously activate a MR sensor and to disable the write head during the read back process to eliminate the secondary read back signal from the inductive-write head. During the read process, the current through a first conductor biases the MR stripe while current through the second conductor generates an applied field to switch the magnetization of the permalloy in the write head pole and reduce the permeability. The head incorporates write-wide read-narrow head attributes and has the reliability advantages associated with yoke or recessed MR or GMR structures. The magnetoresistive stripe may be disposed directly in the gap of the heads or it may be recessed.

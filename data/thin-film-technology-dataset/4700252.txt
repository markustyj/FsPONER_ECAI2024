A magnetic thin film head used for perpendicular magnetic recording and reproduction. The head includes a magneto-resistive element and a flux guide made of high permeability thin film whose one end portion faces a perpendicular magnetic recording medium. The magnetic flux produced by the magnetization signal on the perpendicular magnetic recording medium is led to the magneto-resistive element through the flux guide. The head also includes electrodes for supplying an electric current londitudinally to the magneto-resistive element, and high permeability members for introducing the magnetic flux through the magneto-resistive element back to the perpendicular magnetic recording medium. The head further includes a exciting means for the flux guide.

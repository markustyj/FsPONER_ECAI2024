A head piece aggregate which includes a plurality of columns of thin-film magnetic head elements is cut from a wafer which is provided with a plurality of thin-film magnetic head elements arrayed in a lattice-like pattern on a base body. The thin-film magnetic head elements in the columns included in the head piece aggregate thus cut out have the same directionality on a given surface. Then, one of the two cut surfaces of the head piece aggregate is attached to a mounting tool so that polishing can be performed on the other surface. Next, the uppermost column of the plurality of columns included in the head piece aggregate is cut away from the others. Deviation in throat height caused by bow and bend of the head piece aggregate can, thereby, be prevented.

 A single-element magnetoresistive (MR) read head with reduced susceptibility to noise is disclosed. In particular, the present invention addresses the problem of noise generated thermally through contact with the recording medium. The present invention solves this problem by keeping the temperature of the read head at a level that minimizes the noise level. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the shielding material used in the read head is recessed with respect to the magnetic-medium-bearing surface. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, a thin coating of metal on the read head surface is applied. In yet another embodiment, the read element is operated with a low bias current so as to minimize the thermal effect of power consumption due to electrical resistance. In still another embodiment, the read element makes use of insulating material that is both an electrical insulator and a high quality thermal insulator.

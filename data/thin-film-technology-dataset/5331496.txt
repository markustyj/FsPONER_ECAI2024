A thin film magnetic head, and process for making the same, features a thin film magnetic transducer formed from multiple layers of film and having a magnetic yoke interacting with an electrical coil. The yoke has multiple magnetic flux circuits, deposited on multiple layers of film, encircling the center of the transducer and connected together by proximal and distal vias. A coil has multiple turns intertwined with the yoke, passing between the distal and proximal vias so that the distal vias are exterior to the coil and the proximal Vias are interior to the coil, to provide at least four magnetic flux interactions between the coil and the yoke. In preferred embodiments at least one layer of the film is deposited with at least two pole pieces having different easy axis orientations. In other preferred embodiments at least one distal via is configured as an elongated "flux strap" for conducting magnetic flux along the length of the via in a direction oblique to the easy axis of either pole piece coupled together by the magnetic flux strap.

 A recording head for use in magnetic storage devices is disclosed. The recording head includes a transducer that is bi-directionally movable with respect to a magnetic medium surface of the magnetic storage medium, thereby enabling improved positioning of the transducer during read and write operations of the transducer. The recording head further includes a wafer assembly having a motor segment and a flexure segment that are joined together. The flexure segment includes a cavity that receives the transducer therein. The recording head further includes a slider body that receives the wafer assembly in a cavity defined therein. A motor located in the motor segment can be selectively actuated to cause movement of the flexure assembly and corresponding movement of the transducer body. Various features regarding the construction and assembly of the recording head are also disclosed to improve head operation, including techniques for preventing head damage during a shock event.

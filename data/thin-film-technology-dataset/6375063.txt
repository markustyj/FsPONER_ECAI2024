A multi-step stud design and method for fabricating the same of special utility for producing closely packed interconnects in magnetic recording heads, particularly higher density magnetoresistive and giant magnetoresistive tape heads. The multi-step stud fabrication process and structure enables the achievement of significantly higher interconnect densities resulting in an increased number of channels per millimeter on a single computer mass storage device recording head. A resultant stronger encapsulation surrounding the stud further provides increased channel reliability. The improved uniformity of the photoresist aperture achieved for each step in the stud structure, and lower current spreading resistance because of the wider underlying stud base size, increases stud uniformity resulting in improved stud yields. This increased yield compared with conventional single step stud processes reduces cost, even with the additional photolithography and plating processes involved.

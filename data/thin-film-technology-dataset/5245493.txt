A magnetic head for reading from and/or writing to a magnetic information storage medium has a substrate on which a plurality of thin films are formed in sequence. The films provide a magnetic circuit having a magnetic gap, a bottom pole piece and a top pole piece overlying said bottom pole piece. The top pole piece is formed as a tip portion adjoining the magnetic gap and a rear portion which makes magnetic contact with the tip portion. The rear portion is formed in the sequence after the tip portion. To ensure accurate thickness and width of the tip portion, a non-magnetic protective film is formed on the tip portion after the tip portion is formed and before the rear portion is formed.

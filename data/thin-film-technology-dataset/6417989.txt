Read and write performance in a magnetic thin-film head is improved by forming a highly compact multiple-gap head with separate magnetic core and coil structures for a read head and a write head that are respectively designed to improve reading and writing performance. A thin film magnetic head includes a thin-film magnetic core including a read core portion and an interconnected write core portion, a thin-film read coil encircling the read core portion, and a thin-film write coil encircling the write core portion. The read core portion is separated by a read magnetic gap and the write core portion being separated by a write magnetic gap. The read gap and write gap are mutually combined in close proximity in abutting sections of the read core portion and the write core portion respectively so that a magnetic medium is accessible to the read gap and the write gap simultaneously.

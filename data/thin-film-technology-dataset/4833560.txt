In a magnetoresistive reproduce head which is self-biased by a saturated soft adjacent layer magnetically coupled to the magnetoresistive element, the induced anisotropy fields of the magnetoresistive element and the soft adjacent layer are made to lie in the direction of the bias field at the magnetoresistive element rather than perpendicular to the bias field. These induced anistropy fields partially counteract demagnetizing fields which oppose the bias field, and thereby lower the current in the magnetoresistive element required to saturate the soft adjacent layer in biasing the magnetoresistive element. The lowered current reduces the Joule heating of the magnetoresistive element and attendantly results in improved head performance.

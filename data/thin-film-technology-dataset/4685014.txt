In producing a magnetic head by thin film technique, a magnetic film is formed on an insulating member covering coil conductor films after the surface of the insulating member is flattened. After a flattening coating is formed on the insulating member, the flattening coating as well as the insulating member are etched by plasma-assisted etching technique in order to flatten the surface.

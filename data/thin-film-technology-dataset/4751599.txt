A thin-film magnetic head is composed of a lower magnetic layer, a first insulating layer, a coil conductor, a second insulating layer, a gapping layer disposed on the second insulating layer and having an end exposed for sliding contact with a magnetic recording medium for recording signals on and reproducing signals from the magnetic recording medium, and an upper magnetic layer disposed on the gapping layer. The coil conductor has a plurality of turns including an outermost turn having a portion which is closest to the end of the gapping layer and which has a width larger than that of each of the other turns. The coil turns may also include an innermost turn having a portion which is remote from the end of the gapping layer and which has a width larger than that of each of the other turns except the portion of the outermost turn.

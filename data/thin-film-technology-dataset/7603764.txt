 A method for manufacturing a thin film magnetic head having superior overwrite characteristics as well as having a locally minimized pole width includes: forming top pole chip having a first magnetic film that is a top layer portion of the top pole chip; forming a second magnetic film that is a bottom layer portion of the top pole chip; and forming the first and second magnetic films of magnetic material having a high magnetic flux density of 1.5 tesla or more; wherein a thin film magnetic head is produced that does not suffer from saturation of magnetic flux in the top pole chip, even when the pole width is locally minimized to about 0.3 .mu.m or less, and therefore has superior overwrite characteristics.

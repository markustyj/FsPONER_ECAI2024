An economical and reliable film magnetic head comprises magnetic layers, a coil conductor layer, insulating layers, and a protective layer formed on a substrate, with copper electrode pads connected to the coil conductor layer. A layer of Ti or Cr is formed on the surface of each electrode pad, preventing the copper electrode pads from corroding.

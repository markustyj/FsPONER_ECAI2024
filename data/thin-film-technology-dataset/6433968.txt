A merged thin film read/write head having a read element having a first shield layer, a second shield layer and a magnetoresistive element disposed between the first and second shield layers, a thin spacer layer of nonmagnetic material formed upon the second shield layer and an inductive write element having a first pole pedestal formed upon the spacer layer and a second pole separated from the pedestal by a gap. The pedestal includes a tapered portion for reducing the formation of pinned magnetic domains in the pedestal and providing improved flux passage. In combination with the thin nonmagnetic spacer layer, the tapered feature of the pedestal eliminates popcorn noise in the read element.

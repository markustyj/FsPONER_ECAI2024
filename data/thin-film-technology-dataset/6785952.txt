A first magnetic film, a gap film, a thin film coil supported by a insulated film and a second magnetic film are formed in turn. The second magnetic film has a pole part opposite to the first magnetic film via the gap film and a yoke part extending backward from the pole part to be magnetically connected to the first magnetic film. The forefront surface of the yoke part is receded from an air bearing surface. The pole part of the second magnetic film has a step d1 in a running direction of a magnetic recording medium and a step d2 in the perpendicular direction to the running direction within the yoke forefront surface and its periphery as is viewed from the yoke forefront surface. A protective film embeds the steps d1 and d2, and covers an inductive type thin film magnetic head element entirely. Thereby, without debasing the overwrite characteristic when the pole part is miniaturized, a thin film magnetic head having a narrowed track width can be provided.

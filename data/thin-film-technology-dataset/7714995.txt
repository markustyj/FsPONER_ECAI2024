 A material independent profiler system and method for measuring a slope on the surface of an object such as a thin film disk, a silicon wafer, or a glass substrate is disclosed. In one embodiment, the system comprises an electromagnetic energy source to generate a beam of electromagnetic energy, a polarizer to polarize the beam of electromagnetic energy into a first component having a first polarization orientation and a second component having a second polarization orientation, a radiation targeting assembly to direct the first component onto the surface in a first direction and a first plane of orientation, direct the second component onto the surface in a second direction and a second plane of orientation, wherein the second direction is opposite the first direction, a radiation detector assembly to generate a first signal from a portion of the first component reflected from the surface, generate a second signal from a portion of the second component reflected from the surface, and a processor to generate a surface measurement from the first signal and the second signal.

 A thin film magnetic head having one or more magneto-resistive (MR) elements. A thermally conductive stud is incorporated in an underlayer of the head, below the bottom shield of the MR element. This stud acts as a heat sink, and enhances the heat flow from the bottom shield to the substrate to thereby reduce thermal contact noise in the device, as well as allowing use of higher bias currents when reading signals from the media.

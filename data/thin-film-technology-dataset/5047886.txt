A thin-film magnetic head is constructed by a lower core, a first insulating layer, a gap layer, a plurality of coil conductor layers, a plurality of insulating layers and an upper layer. The coil conductor layers are respectively embedded in the insulating layers. Each of the coil conductor layers is spirally formed on the gap layer, and the coil conductor layers are sequentially piled up on the gap layer. The gap layer is formed on the first insulating layer which coats and insulates the lower core. Then, an edge portion is formed by sandwiching the first insulating layer and the gap layer between the lower and upper cores. The first insulating layer whose shape affects the writing/reading efficiency of the thin-film magnetic head is protected by the gap layer. Preferably, the gap layer is formed by coating Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 film or SiO.sub.2 on the first insulating layer.

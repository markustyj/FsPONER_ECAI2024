 A thin-film magnetic head structure has a configuration adapted to manufacture a thin-film magnetic head configured such that a main magnetic pole layer including a magnetic pole end part on a side of a medium-opposing surface opposing a recording medium, a write shield layer opposing the magnetic pole end part so as to form a recording gap layer on the medium-opposing surface side, and a thin-film coil wound about the write shield layer or main magnetic pole layer are laminated. The main magnetic pole layer includes a base magnetic pole part comprising the magnetic pole end part and a base depression distanced farther from the medium-opposing surface than the magnetic pole end part, and an embedded magnetic pole part buried in the base depression and joined to the base magnetic pole part. The thin-film magnetic head structure includes a yoke magnetic pole part joined to the base magnetic pole part and embedded magnetic pole part at a position distanced farther from the medium-opposing surface than the recording gap layer, and an intervening insulative film disposed between the embedded magnetic pole part and yoke magnetic pole part at a position distanced farther from the medium-opposing surface than the recording gap layer.

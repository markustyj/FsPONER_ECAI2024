A thin film magnetic head is capable of reducing inductance by shortening a magnetic path, and also preventing a cavity from being formed in a coil insulating layer. The coil insulating layer is deposited on a lower core layer and at the rear of a recording portion, and a coil forming groove is formed in the coil insulating layer. Then, a coil layer is embedded in the coil forming groove. With this arrangement, bulges of the layers from an upper surface of the recording portion can be decreased so as to shorten a magnetic path.

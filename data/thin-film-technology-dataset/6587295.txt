A property improving method includes first and second steps. In the first step popcorn noise in a read signal of a thin-film magnetic head is measured so as to determine whether the popcorn noise falls within a permissible range. In the second step a current is fed to the recording head of the thin-film magnetic head, the current having a value greater than that of the current fed when a normal writing operation is performed. While the value of the current fed to the recording head is gradually increased in the second step, the first and second steps are alternately repeated until it is determined that the popcorn noise falls within a permissible range in the first step, or the current value reaches a specific upper limit.

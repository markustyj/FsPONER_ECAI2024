A magnetic recording medium is disclosed, wherein a magnetic film comprising a partially oxidized cobalt with its in-plane coercive force not less than 500 Oe is provided on a substrate. Further disclosed are megnetic recording media, wherein there is further provided an underlayer comprising Cr, Fe or an Fe-Co alloy under said magnetic film, and wherein a perpendicular magnetic anisotropic film comprising a partially oxidized metal is further provided on said magnetic film. The magnetic recording media of the present invention are high in recording density and reproduction output, low in noise and high in S/N ratio.

A method for manufacturing a thin film magnetic head includes a step of preparing a wafer with a thickness greater than a desired slider length for the magnetic head, a step of forming a plurality of thin film magnetic head elements on one surface of the wafer, a step of slicing the wafer to obtain a plurality of bars so that each of the bars includes a plurality of the thin film magnetic head elements, and a step of longitudinally cutting each of the bars in parallel with a first side face of the bar, on which the thin film magnetic head elements are formed, to remove a portion of the bar at the side of a second side face which is opposed to the first side face so that a length of the bar becomes equal to the desired slider length for the magnetic head.

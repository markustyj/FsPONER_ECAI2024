A thin-film magnetic head having a magnetic substrate made from ferrite, iron-aluminum-silicon alloy or like material, and an upper magnetic layer formed on the magnetic substrate with a lower magnetic layer and a conductive layer interposed therebetween. A portion of the upper magnetic layer is jointed to the magnetic substrate while another portion of the upper magnetic layer is jointed to the lower magnetic layer through a non-magnetic layer of SiO.sub.2 or like material constituting a magnetic gap. The lower magnetic layer, magnetic substrate, upper magnetic layer and the non-magnetic layer in combination form a closed magnetic circuit. A groove is defined between the lower magnetic layer and the magnetic substrate, and formed in the side surface of the magnetic substrate adapted to face a magnetic recording medium. The recess is filled with a non-magnetic material such as glass. Accordingly, it is possible to realize a definite pole piece length to permit an improvement in short-wavelength reproduction characteristics.

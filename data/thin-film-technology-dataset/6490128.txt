A coil layer as an electrically conductive thin-film of a thin-film device comprises a copper layer as an electrically conductive material layer and a nickel layer as an electrically conductive protective layer composed of a material, in which an oxide layer formed on the material grows to a thickness of not more than a predetermined thickness. Consequently, the thickness of the oxide layer can be predicted and the oxide layer can be reliably removed by ion-milling or the like.

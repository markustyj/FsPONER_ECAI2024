Method for producing a head core slider for a rigid magnetic disk drive, including a ferrite slider body having a pair of air bearing portions which have a predetermined height and are spaced apart from each other in a transverse direction perpendicular to a direction of extension thereof, and further including a pair of ferrite yoke portions formed integrally with the slider body. The yoke portions cooperate with the slider body to form a first and a second closed magnetic path and define therebetween a first and a second magnetic gap. The slider body and the yoke portions cooperate to provide a first and a second track portion in which the first and second magnetic gaps are open, respectively. The first and second track portions have sliding surfaces which have the same height as the air bearing portions. The first track portion is used exclusively for an information writing operation, while the second track portion is used exclusively for an information reading operation. Where the first and second track portions have a same width, the first and second magnetic gaps have different sizes. Where the two magnetic gaps have a same size, the two track portions have different widths. Alternatively, the two track portions have different widths while the two magnetic gaps have different sizes.

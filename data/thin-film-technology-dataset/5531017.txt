A novel thin film magnetic head fabrication process is provided for fabricating a plurality of thin film magnetic head elements. The process begins with the selection of an appropriate wafer substrate of suitable size and quality. At least two primary sub-areas of the wafer substrate are designated as work areas for the deposition of magnetic recording transducer elements. The work areas have first and second end portions and are arranged in mutually adjacent relation along a shared boundary zone that extends in a first direction through the wafer substrate between the first and second end portions. The wafer substrate is populated with plural rows of magnetic recording transducer elements in the designated work areas such that the plural rows extend in a second direction that is substantially perpendicular to the first direction. The work areas are separated from the wafer substrate and magnetic transducer slider elements are fabricated from the plural rows of magnetic recording transducer elements. The process steps are such that they reduce the number of fabrication steps to a minimum while increasing the consistency of throat and stripe heights.

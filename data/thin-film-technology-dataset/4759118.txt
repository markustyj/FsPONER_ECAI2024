A method of manufacturing a thin film magnetic head is disclosed. This method is characterized such that a protection film is formed on a substrate; only corresponding portions of the protection film to bonding pads are ground in a groove-like configuration before cutting out the thin film magnetic heads therefrom so that the bonding pads are exposed; and the substrate is cut to a predetermined size per thin film magnetic head. With this arrangement, it is feasible to prevent an upper magnetic layer from being damaged during the grinding operation.

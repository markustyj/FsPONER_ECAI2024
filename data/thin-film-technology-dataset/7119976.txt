 A planar servo verifier head is provided comprising a plurality of magnetic head elements optimized for the readback process. The plurality of magnetic head elements are fabricated in a planar two-dimensional array in which individual elements can be used to read servo format tracks spaced across the width of a magnetic tape. In one embodiment, the magnetic head element comprises a read transducer formed of one or more turns of a sense wire inductively coupled to a magnetic yoke in a trench formed on the transducing surface of a substrate. In another embodiment, the magnetic head element comprises a read transducer formed of a thin film magnetoresistive sensor coupled to a magnetic flux guide in a trench formed on the transducing surface of a substrate. According to the method for manufacturing an embodiment of the servo verifier read head for magnetic tape recording, a plurality of trenches are formed in a nonmagnetic substrate wafer, preferably, a ceramic wafer. A first magnetic permeable layer is deposited in the trench. A first insulating layer is deposited on the first magnetic permeable layer. A conducting circuit is defined on the first insulating layer such as by lithographically defining the circuit. A second insulating layer is deposited in the trench such that the conducting circuit is enclosed between the first and second insulating layers. The wafer can be planarized down to about the original surface level of the wafer. A pattern of read gaps is defined and a second magnetic layer is added over the second insulating layer.

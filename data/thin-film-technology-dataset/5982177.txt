A magnetic sensor for detecting the presence of a magnetic sample proximate a sensing region. A magnetoresistive element is positioned in a biasing region of the sensor which is spaced apart from the sensing region. A magnetic circuit provides a magnetic field to the sensing region and the biasing region. The magnetic field biases the magnetoresistive element positioned in the biasing region. A circuit detects changes in the magnetic field in the biasing region as a function of changes in the resistance of the magnetoresistive element whereby changes in the magnetic field caused by the presence of a magnetic sample proximate the sensing region are detected.

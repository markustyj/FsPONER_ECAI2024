 By inserting a first antistripping layer comprising a first non-magnetic layer 22 and a first conductive layer 23 between a first magnetic layer 16 and a magnetic separation layer 13, adhesion between the first conductive layer 23 and the magnetic separation layer 13 is improved to prevent the first magnetic layer 16 from stripping. In addition, by inserting a second antistripping layer comprising a second non-magnetic layer 24 and a second conductive layer 25 between a second magnetic layer 21 and a magnetic gap layer 17, adhesion between the second conductive layer 24 and the magnetic gap layer 17 is improved to prevent the second magnetic layer 25 from stripping.

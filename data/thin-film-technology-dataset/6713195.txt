A ferromagnetic thin-film based magnetoresistive device with a first ferromagnetic material based film having electrically conductive, ferromagnetic material nanogranules embedded in an intergranular material of a smaller electrical conductivity first nonmagnetic. The device may have an intermediate layer adjacent the first ferromagnetic material based film and a second film is on the other side of the intermediate layer of a substantially ferromagnetic material. The first film is less than 1.0 .mu.m thick.

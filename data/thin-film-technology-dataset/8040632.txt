 A head for a hard disk drive. The head includes a substrate, a write element, a read element and a heater element. The head also includes a buffer layer between the read element and the substrate, and a first resistor connected to the heater element and the buffer layer. The buffer layer and resistor create an impedance that suppresses noise introduced to the head from the disk of the drive.

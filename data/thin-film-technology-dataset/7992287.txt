 A system for fabricating a transducer for an ink jet imaging device comprises a transducer assembly including a transducer overlying at least a portion of a flexible carrier. The transducer has a top surface extending a first distance from the carrier. A spacer overlies a portion of the carrier not covered by the transducer. The spacer has a top surface extending a second distance form the carrier. The second distance is less than the first distance and corresponds to a target thickness for the transducer. A lapping tool is configured to lap the top surface of the transducer. The system includes a detector for detecting when the lapping tool contacts the lapping spacer.

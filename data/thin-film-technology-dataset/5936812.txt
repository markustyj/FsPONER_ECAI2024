An upper magnetic layer and a lower magnetic layer of an inductive magnetic conversion element constitute pole tips which face opposite each other over a gap layer at their front end portions and have a back gap portion for completing a thin film magnetic circuit at the rear. A magnetoresistive element is provided on a slider below the inductive magnetic conversion element between an upper shield layer positioned above it and a lower shield layer positioned below it. The upper shield layer also constitutes the lower magnetic layer of the inductive magnetic conversion element. The lower shield layer is formed outside a projection area achieved by projecting the back gap portion onto the surface where the lower shield layer is formed.

 Systems and methods for providing hybrid coils for magnetic write heads used in disk drives are described. One such system includes a magnetic read/write head including a read transducer, and a write transducer including a pair of write poles, a hybrid coil including a first coil having a pancake coil configuration including at least one turn positioned between the pair of write poles, and a second coil having a helical coil configuration including a plurality of turns positioned between the pair of write poles, the second coil coupled to the first coil, where the at least one turn of the first coil is interleaved with the turns of the second coil.

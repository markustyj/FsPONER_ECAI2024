A lower magnetic pole layer and/or an upper magnetic pole layer are formed of a CoFe.alpha. alloy in which the component ratio X of Co is 8 to 48 mass %, the component ratio Y of Fe is 50 to 90 mass %, the component ratio Z of the element .alpha. (the element .alpha. is at least one of Ni and Cr) is 2 to 20 mass %, and the equation X+Y+Z=100 mass % is satisfied. Consequently, the saturated magnetic flux density can be 2.0 T or more, and a thin-film magnetic head have a higher recording density can be manufactured.

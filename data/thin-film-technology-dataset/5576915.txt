A magnetoresistive head includes an antiferromagnetic portion interposed between first and second spin-valve units. Sense current supply directions through the first and second spin-valve units are perpendicular to a head facing surface of a magnetic recording medium. The first spin-valve unit is formed of a first inner magnetic film, a first outer magnetic film and a nonmagnetic film interposed between and in direct physical contact with the first inner magnetic film and the first outer magnetic film. The second spin-valve unit is formed of a second inner magnetic film, a second outer magnetic film and a nonmagnetic film interposed between and in direct physical contact with the second inner magnetic film and the second outer magnetic film. The antiferromagnetic portion is formed of a first antiferromagnetic sublayer and a second antiferromagnetic sublayer laminated on the first antiferromagnetic sublayer. The first antiferromagnetic sublayer is in contact with the first inner magnetic film to apply a first exchange bias magnetic field to the first inner magnetic film in a direction perpendicular to the head facing surface of the magnetic recording medium. The second antiferromagnetic sublayer is in contact with the second inner magnetic film to apply a second exchange bias magnetic field to the second inner magnetic film in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the magnetic recording medium. The second exchange bias magnetic field has a polarity opposite to that of the first exchange bias magnetic field.

A method of making a thin film magnetic head assembly having a spaced substrate and superstrate with a thin film magnetic transducer mounted therebetween by the steps of positioning at least one spacing member between the substrate and superstrate, placing a quantity of insulating bonding material of selected characteristics adjacent the spaced substrate and superstrate and controllably heating the substrate, superstrate, thin film magnetic transducer and spacing member sub-assembly to a bonding temperature located in a bonding temperature range and maintaining the sub-assembly at a bonding temperature to enable the bonding material to substantially fill the space by capillary action thereby encapsulating the thin film magnetic transducer bonding the substrate, superstrate and thin film magnetic transducer into an integral assembly is shown.

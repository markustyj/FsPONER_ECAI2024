 The present invention provides servo systems and accompanying methods for determining the relative position of a transducer head to a magnetic storage tape utilizing existing data structures on the magnetic storage tape and the position of the tape edge. In one example, a method for positioning a transducer head relative to a magnetic storage medium includes sensing a read signal from a read element associated with a transducer head, the read signal in response to a reference data track stored on a magnetic storage medium, optically sensing a position of an edge of the storage medium, and repositioning the transducer head relative to the storage medium in response to the read signal and the position of the edge of the storage medium.

A thin film helical conductor coil assembly includes an electrically-nonconducting ceramic substrate having a substantially planar surface and separated first and second magnetic elements which mutually bound a volume of the ceramic substrate. The thin film conductor coil assembly also includes a thin film magnetic core, which magnetically connects the first magnetic element to the second magnetic element. The thin film magnetic core, which overlies the substantially planar surface of the ceramic substrate, is constructed from a compliant electroplated magnetic material. The thin film conductor coil assembly further includes an electroplated thin film helical coil which traverses about the thin film magnetic core and forms a conductive path from a first terminal to a second terminal.

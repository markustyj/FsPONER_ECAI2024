A thin film magnetic head comprising a lower magnetic core, an upper magnetic core, and a thin film copper coil wound between magnetic poles of the lower and upper magnetic cores, the time constant of which can be reduced by reducing the specific resistance of the thin film coil and reducing insulating resin layers between the thin film coil conductors and between the coil layers, thereby allowing writing information at higher frequencies. The average crystal grain size of the thin film copper coil is made to be not more than 0.5 .mu.m. More preferably, the average crystal grain size should be not more than 0.2 .mu.m. In the thin film magnetic head, the surface roughness of the thin film copper coil can be reduced to not more than 15 nm.

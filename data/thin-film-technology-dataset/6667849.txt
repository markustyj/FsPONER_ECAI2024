A thin film magnetic head that suppresses "leakage of magnetic flux" and has an excellent overwrite characteristic and a method of manufacturing the same are provided. Between a top pole tip and a bottom pole, first and second non-magnetic layer patterns are disposed in order from the bottom pole. The position of a front end of the second non-magnetic layer pattern recedes rearward of the position of a front end of the first non-magnetic layer pattern, and thereby a step is formed between the first non-magnetic layer pattern and the second non-magnetic layer pattern. Due to the existence of the first and second non-magnetic layer patterns, the propagation of the magnetic flux between the top pole tip and the bottom pole is suppressed, and the flow of the magnetic flux in the top pole tip is smoothed so that the excellent overwrite characteristic can be assured.

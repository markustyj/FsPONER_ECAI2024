The thin film magnet head is to be guided over a recording medium to be magnetized perpendicularly, in which flux changes are to be registered along a track with a predetermined record wavelength and flux change density. The magnet head contains a flux-carrying, ring head-like guiding element with two magnet legs which constitute magnet poles which are arranged one behind the other and separated by a gap of predetermined width and having predetermined extents in the movement direction. With this magnet head the expanse for signal processing in a write/read channel is to be reduced. The magnet head fulfills this end by at least approximately satisfying the following relation:.lambda.* being the record wavelength which results for the value D.sub.p of the flux change density at which the read voltage of the magnet head is maximum; g, the width of the gap; and max(A.sub.1, A.sub.2) the greater value of the two extents (A.sub.1, A.sub.2) of the magnet poles.

 A method for measuring the thickness of a thin film disk overcoat layer includes radiating x-rays on a thin film disk comprising at least one base layer and an overcoat layer, collecting fluorescence data on electromagnetic radiation fluoresced from the thin film disk, reflecting polarized light from a surface of the thin film disk corresponding to the overcoat layer, collecting ellipsometry data from the polarized light, and estimating the thickness of the overcoat layer using both the fluorescence data and the ellipsometry data. The method may further include providing a statistical model to determine optimal deposition and manufacturing parameters. A system to conduct the described method may include a data analyzer, an ellipsometry measurement device, and an x-ray fluorescence measurement device.

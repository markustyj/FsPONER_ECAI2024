A plurality of magnetoresistive heads are arranged on a wafer substrate. A plurality of electrode pads are arranged on the wafer substrate in a first direction. Each electrode pad is connected to an associated magnetoresistive head. Respective adjacent electrode pads are shifted from each other in a second direction perpendicular to the first direction. The shifted amount of the adjacent pads in the second direction is larger than a dimension of the electrode pad in the second direction.

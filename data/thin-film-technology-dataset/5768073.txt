A magnetic thin film head with reduced undershoot characteristics includes a pair of relatively high permeability pole members having a low permeability gap member therebetween. Disposed adjacent to the surfaces of the pole members, which are opposite to the gap member, are layers of magnetic material of lower permeability than the permeability of the pole members, these lower permeability layers having a Curie point temperature which is within the operating temperature range of the head so that these lower permeability layers are paramagnetic. In operation, the lower permeability layers provide a change in permeability across the head gap which reduces the transition in permeability at the head pole tips, thereby reducing undershoots.

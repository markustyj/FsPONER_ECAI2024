A method for forming a giant magnetoresistance sensor and method for making is described incorporating an oriented granular layer wherein the layer has a copper matrix with magnetic particles of a nickel cobalt alloy wherein the magnetic particles have a magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant K.sub.1 in the range from 0 to 3.times.10.sup.4 ergs/cm.sup.3. Alternatively, a silver or gold matrix may be used with magnetic particles of a nickel-iron alloy. The granular layer preferably has a (100) texture to provide the magnetic particles with their easy axes in the plane of the layer. The magnetic particles have their largest dimension in the range from 40 to 400 angstroms. The invention overcomes the problem of requiring a large magnetic field to obtain the saturation .DELTA.R/R. By providing a granular film with magnetic particles of low anisotropy, the saturation field to obtain .DELTA.R/R may be as low as 10 to 20 Oe.

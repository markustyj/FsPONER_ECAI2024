In accordance with the present invention, an apparatus and process for convenient electrical access following application of an overcoat layer to the core of a thin film transducer for measuring core-to-coil impedance and breakdown voltage during manufacture and final testing is disclosed. The invention may employ existing process feedback circuitry at the wafer level typically severed in the machining process or the invention provides for a permanent dedicated terminal on the support structure.

A thin film magnetic head includes first and second head chips, each of the head chips having a substrate, a reproducing head portion provided in a side edge portion on the substrate, and a protecting plate convering the reproducing head portion and the recording head portion. The reproducing head portion and the recording head portion are formed of a lower magentic layer, an electroconductive coil layer, an upper magnetic layer and insulation layers interposed therebetween, deposited in stacked relation on the substrate one after another. The first and second head chips are arranged in side-by-side relation and are inverted with respect to each other so that the recording head portion in the first head chip and the reproducing head portion in the second head chip form a recording/reproducing head portion for a first traveling direction of a magnetic recording medium, and the reprducing head portion in the first head chip and the recording head portion in the second head chip form a recording/reproducing head portion for a second or reverse traveling direction of the recording medium.

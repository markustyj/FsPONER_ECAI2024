 A magnetoresistive sensor having magnetically anisotropic bias layers for biasing the free layer of the sensor. The hard magnetic layer is formed over a seed layer structure that has been treated to induce the magnetic anisotropy in the hard bias layers. The treated seed layers also allow the hard bias layers to be deposited over a crystalline material such as in a partial mill design, without the need for a buffer layer such as Si to break the epitaxial growth initiated by the underlying crystalline layer.

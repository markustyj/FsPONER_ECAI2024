 In formation of an upper shield of a magnetic thin film head by electroplating, a current density of electroplating is regulated stepwise with time. Thus, in the upper shield formation, a film composition and magnetic characteristic with respect to the direction of film thickness can be controlled precisely, making it possible to provide a magnetic thin film head featuring significantly reduced noise-after-write and output fluctuation.

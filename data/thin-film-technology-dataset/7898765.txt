 Provided is a thin-film magnetic head that can be adequately contacted with the magnetic recording medium, and thus, can perform read and write operations sufficiently and stably. This head comprises: at least one magnetic head element for reading and/or writing data, formed on/above an element formation surface of a substrate; an overcoat layer formed so as to cover the at least one magnetic head element; and a closure adhered on at least a portion of an upper surface of the overcoat layer, wherein a groove, extending in a track width direction, is provided on a medium-opposed surface: in an area on an end surface of the substrate, the area being on a boundary between the substrate and the overcoat layer; or in an area covering end surface portions of the substrate and the overcoat layer, the area thus overlapping the boundary between the substrate and the overcoat layer.

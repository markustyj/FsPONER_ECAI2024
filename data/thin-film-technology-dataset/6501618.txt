A first magnetic member including a first pole portion and a first yoke portion is formed so as to be supported by a substrate, and a write gap film is formed so as to cover the first magnetic member. A thin film is formed so as to be supported by an insulating film, and thereafter, an antireflection film is formed on the surface of the insulating film including an inclined portion rising on the write gap film. The antireflection film is patterned by a photolithography process so that the patterned antireflection film can remain only on the inclined portion. Then, a photoresist is applied so as to cover the antireflection film and the insulating film, and is processed by a photolithography process for a second magnetic member to form a resistframe having a given enclosed pattern. In the enclosed pattern of the resistframe is formed, so as to cover the antireflection film, the second magnetic member including a second pole portion opposing to the first pole portion via a write gap film and constituting, with the first pole portion, an air bearing surface to oppose to a magnetic recording medium and a second yoke portion magnetically connected to the first yoke portion in the remote position from the air bearing surface. In this way, the thin film magnetic head having the antireflection film between the insulating film and the second pole portion of the second magnetic member can be obtained.

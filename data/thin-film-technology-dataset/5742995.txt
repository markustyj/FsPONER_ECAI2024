A system and method of determining a height of a sensor is disclosed. The sensor has an air bearing surface. The method includes determining a pre-processing width of a base of a first triangle, a top of a second triangle and a first and a second rectangle, all formed of the same material which forms the sensor. The air bearing surface of the magnetoresistive sensor, the base of the first triangle, the top of the second triangle and the first and second rectangles are then processed and simultaneously lapped. A post-lapping width of the base of the first triangle, the top of the second triangle and the first and second rectangles are then determined. The height of the sensor is then calculated through use of the pre-processing and post-lapping widths at the air bearing surfaces of the bases of the first triangle, the top of the second triangle and the first and second rectangles.

The object of the present invention is to improve the bonding characteristics and peeling resistance of the insulating film formed on the substrate of a thin-film magnetic head.An insulating film consisting of Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 is formed by sputtering on the surface of an ALTIC substrate in which numerous recesses and projections (in which the projecting portions consist of TiC) have been formed by selectively removing the alumina portions of said substrate by etching using an RIE process. An electromagnetic transducer element circuit is then laminated on the surface of said insulating film.Since the contact area between the substrate surface and the insulating layer is increased, and especially since the contact area between the TiC and the Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 is increased due to the projection of the TiC, the bonding force between the two films is increased, and the resistance to peeling is conspicuously improved. Accordingly, the manufacturing yield is improved and the durability of the heads manufactured is also improved, so that slider miniaturization can easily be accomplished.

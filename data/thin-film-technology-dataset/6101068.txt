A thin-film magnetic head includes an MR element serving as a reproducing element and a recording induction coil. The MR element is disposed between a lower magnetic pole and an intermediate magnetic pole. The recording induction coil is disposed between the intermediate magnetic pole and an upper magnetic pole. At least a portion of the upper magnetic pole in the vicinity of a recording gap is formed of a material having a high saturation magnetic flux density of 1.4 T or higher. The intermediate magnetic pole is formed of a material having a high resistivity of 80 .mu..OMEGA..multidot.cm or higher.

A camera for use with a photo film having a magnetic layer includes an exposure frame, behind which a film support plate supports the photo film. A magnetic head is disposed on the film support plate, and includes a shielding case, and a core provided with a coil wound thereon. The core is at least partially contained in the shielding and may have a portion which extends from the shielding case for contacting the recording layer. The lo core has curvature with reference to a longitudinal direction of the film and is convex with respect to the exposure frame. A pad confronts the magnetic head, is formed from inflexible material, and contacts the film at the magnetic head. Two projections are mounted on the exposure frame, and support the pad to be shiftable in a width direction of the film. The pad is pressed against the film, thereby to ensure contact of the magnetic head with the recording layer. The film is fed longitudinally between the exposure frame and the film support plate. While the film is fed, the magnetic head writes data to the recording layer and/or reads data therefrom.

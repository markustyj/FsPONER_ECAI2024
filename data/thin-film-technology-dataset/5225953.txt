A perpendicular magnetic recording/reproducing thin film head of the single pole type formed of a magnetic member provided on its main surface with a grooved portion, and a non-magnetic material filled in the grooves of the grooved portion, thin film conductor coils, an inter-layer insulation film and a main magnetic pole film, wherein at least the thin film conductor coils, the inter-layer insulation film and the main magnetic pole film are laminated on the magnetic member to form a return path. The magnetic member and the main magnetic pole film are connected at the return path and the thin film head has an exposed laminated end face adapted to be opposed to a recording medium and the magnetic member forming a return path appears on the exposed laminated end face and is formed with a portion having the same width as that of the main magnetic pole film and arranged in parallel with the main magnetic pole film and the remaining portions other than the parallel portion are arranged in non-parallel relationship with the main magnetic pole film.

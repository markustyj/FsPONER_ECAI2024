A new read/write head for use in a mass storage device in a digital data processing system. The head is a thin-film head having a solenoidal coil around one or both of the pole pieces. Sets of planar conductive traces are formed on planar layers of insulating material on opposing sides of a pole piece, with vias connecting the ends of selected traces to thereby form a solenoidal coil around the pole piece.

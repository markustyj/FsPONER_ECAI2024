Substrates are disclosed having an ultra-smooth surface finish thereon rendering them useful in making high density magnetic storage components, such as a computer hard disk or thin-film head which can read and/or write data on such disks. The substrates are comprised of a non-oxide ceramic base which is coated with a smoothing layer comprised of amorphous, non-stoichiometric silicon carbide corresponding to the formula SiC.sub.x, wherein x is the molar ratio of carbon to silicon and is greater than 1. Also disclosed are processes for making the substrates and components.

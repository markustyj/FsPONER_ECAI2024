 A process for achieving tighter reader and writer track width control is disclosed. The write gap layer is used as the plating seed on which the upper pole is electro-formed. This allows the write gap layer to then be deposited through a precisely controllable process such as sputtering. Since less material needs to be removed during pole trimming, a thinner layer of photoresist may be used, resulting in improved dimensional control.

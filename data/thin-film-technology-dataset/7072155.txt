 A magnetoresistive sensor of the type of flowing a signal sensing current perpendicular to the plane, a magnetic head using the magnetoresistive sensor, and a magnetic disk apparatus, comprising a substrate, a pair of magnetic shield layers consisting of a lower magnetic shield layer and an upper magnetic shield layer, a magnetoresistive sensor layer, disposed between the pair of magnetic shield layers, an electrode terminal for flowing a signal current perpendicular to the plane of the magnetoresistive sensor layer, and magnetic domain control layers for controlling Barkhausen noise of the magnetoresistive sensor layer, the magnetic domain control layers being disposed in contact with opposite ends of the magnetoresistive sensor layer consist of a material having high electric resistivity and with a specific resistance not less than 10 m.OMEGA.cm.

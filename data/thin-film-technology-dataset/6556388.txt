A Vertical Giant Magnetoresistive Sensor (VGMR) with two VGMR structures (61 A, 61 B), each responding differently to an external magnetic field, producing a differential signal proportional to the field. The magnetizations (M1, M1', M2, M2') in each of the sensors are oriented antiparallel. The antiparallel magnetization is attained by altering the magnetic compositions of the two structures, or adding an additional structure such as a permanent magnet or current strip (11) between the VGMR structures.

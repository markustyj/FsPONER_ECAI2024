 A magnetic tape head having an array of reader/writer pairs formed on a common substrate, each reader/writer pair being configured in a piggyback configuration such that the writer and reader of each pair are aligned in a direction parallel to a relative direction of media travel thereover. Each reader comprises a first shield, a second shield, a sensor positioned between the shields, and leads coupled to the sensor. Each writer comprises a first pole and a second pole. A charge clamp circuit electrically couples at least one of the reader shields to at least one of the leads. An electrical conductor operatively electrically couples the at least one of the shields to at least one of the poles.

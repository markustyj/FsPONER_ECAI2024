A thin film magnetic head comprising a thin film magnetic head structure and a protective plate thereon such as glass or the like has an improved bonding interlayer between them. The interlayer is formed by fusing together registered solder areas which have been preformed respectively on the mirror image positions of the upper surface of the head structure and the lower surface of the protective plate.

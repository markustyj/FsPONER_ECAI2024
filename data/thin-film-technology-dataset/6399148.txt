A lapping control sensor for a MR head includes a multi-layered structure of a metallic layer, an insulation layer, a resister layer and a lead conductor layer, and being provided in parallel with the MR head which has a multi-layered structure of at least a lower shield layer, a shield gap insulation layer, a MR layer and a lead conductor layer is provided. The insulation layer of the lapping control sensor has a thickness larger than that of the shield gap insulation layer of the MR head. The thickness of the insulation layer of the sensor is 0.1 .mu.m or more.

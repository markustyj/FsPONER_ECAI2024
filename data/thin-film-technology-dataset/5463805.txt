A system for lapping a magnetoresistive (MR) sensor on a slider to a proper height is disclosed. The system comprises simultaneously lapping the MR lap monitor and the MR sensor positioned on the slider until a resistance of a variable resistor located within the MR lap monitor is approximately equal to a resistance of a target resistor located within the MR lap monitor. During the lapping process, a reference resistor located within the lap monitor is compared to both the variable and target resistors to prevent a lapping failure. In one preferred embodiment, the reference, target, and variable resistors are formed from a ferromagnetic metal alloy. The MR lap monitor and the MR sensor are lapped until a height of the ferromagnetic metal alloy forming the variable resistor is approximately equal to a height of the ferromagnetic metal alloy forming the target resistor.

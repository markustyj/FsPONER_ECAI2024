An MR element and an inductive element are provided. The MR element is provided with a first magnetic shield film and a second magnetic shield film on the two sides of a magnetoresistive film. A first magnetic film of the inductive element and the second magnetic shield film are separated from each other by a non- magnetic film. The non- magnetic film induces magnetic coupling between the second magnetic shield film and the first magnetic film. The width of the first pole portion of the first magnetic film is smaller than the width of the second magnetic shield film and the saturation magnetization of the first magnetic film is higher than the saturation magnetization of the second magnetic shield film.

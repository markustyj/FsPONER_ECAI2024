A head suspension system for use in a photofinishing operation comprises a movable support mounted for movement through an arc having a predetermined radius and a pair of magnetic head suspension assemblies each rotatably mounted on the movable support. The suspension assemblies are biased towards each other to cause surfaces of the magnetic head assemblies to engage opposite edges of a photographic film respectively. The entire system including the movable support is movable through an arc to adjust for angular variations of the film while each head suspension assembly is rotatable relative to the movable support to compensate for film width variations and film edge irregularities to insure constant orientation of the magnetic heads with respect to the film edges.

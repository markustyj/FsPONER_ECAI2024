In a preferred embodiment, a thin film write head having upper and lower pole structures. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a middle coat insulation layer is located over a yoke of the lower pole structure and adjacent a pedestal pole tip of the lower pole structure. A trench is formed in the middle coat layer by etching part way into the middle coat layer. A conductor coil is formed on the middle coat so that a portion of the coil is located within the trench and a portion above the trench. Preferably, the middle coat is planarized and then etched using a resist mask to form the trench. With one method, the resist mask is removed after etching the trench, a conductor seed layer deposited, a resist mask formed on the seed layer, a conductor coil formed within the mask, and the seed layer etched after resist mask removal to electrically isolate the turns of the coil. In another method, after trench etching and resist mask removal, conductor material may be deposited on the middle coat and planarized to form the portion of the coil within the trench. With this method, additional conductor material is deposited on the conductor material in the trench using a resist mask to form the coil. The additional conductor material provided in the trench can significantly reduce the coil resistance without increasing stack height or yoke lengths to improve write head performance.

 An assembly comprises a flex circuit including a first set of electrical contacts on a first side of the flex circuit and a compliant support backing adjacent a second side of the flex circuit and opposite the set of electrical contacts. The first set of electrical contacts is configured to connect to a second set of electrical contacts on an electronic component. The compliant support backing includes a set of support elements that individually support the first set of electrical contacts to increase the contact pressure between the first set of electrical contacts and the second set of electrical contacts when the flex circuit is connected to the electronic component. Embodiments may provide robust electrical contracts which provide a reliable connection useful for testing electronic components, such as head gimbal assemblies.

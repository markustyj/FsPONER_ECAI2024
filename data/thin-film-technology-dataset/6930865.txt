A transducing head has a magnetoresistive sensor, a first bias element, and a second bias element. The magnetoresistive sensor is positioned between the first and second bias elements, and has a sensor width. The first bias element has a first length and the second bias element has a second length. The direction of the first and second lengths are substantially similar to the direction of the sensor width. The first and second lengths in the range of about one-tenth to about twenty times the sensor width.

A system and method for providing a magnetoresistive head is disclosed. The method and system include providing a spin valve including a synthetic free layer. The synthetic free layer includes a ferromagnetic layer. The method and system also include providing an antiferromagnetic biasing layer exchange coupled to a first portion of the ferromagnetic layer. The antiferromagnetic biasing layer magnetically biases the synthetic free layer to ensure the single domain structure and reduce noise.

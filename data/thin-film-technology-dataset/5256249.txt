A magnetoresistive sensor includes a track width oxide layer which overlies a magnetoresistive element. Etch stop layers lie on opposite sides of the magnetoresistive element adjacent a magnetoresistive element. Contact/boundary control layers overlie the etch stop layer and lie adjacent the track width oxide layer. A separate loft oxide layer overlies the contact/boundary control layers and the track width oxide layer. The magnetoresistive sensor is formed by depositing a track width oxide to a thickness of the contact/boundary control layers.

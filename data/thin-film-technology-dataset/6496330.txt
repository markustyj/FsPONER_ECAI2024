A magnetoresistive head having a split coil structure including multiple, similar coil layers separated by an insulator and joined at their ends to define parallel electrical paths. The coil passes through a magnetic yoke having an open end and a closed end and is electrically insulated from the yoke. The parallel electrical paths of the separate coil layers can each be modeled as a resistor in series with an inductor, each of the paths also being in parallel with a capacitor. The split coil has a much faster current rise time than a comparable single layer coil or than multiple coils connected in series. Since the coil current provides the magneto-motive force for imparting a signal on a passing recording medium, the decreased current rise time corresponds to an increased data recording rate.

 A disk drive data storage system, comprising a magnetic disk a head for writing data to the disk, and circuitry for providing a first voltage (HWX) to a first node (N.sub.1) and a second voltage (HWY) to a second node (N.sub.2). The first and second voltage circuitry comprises a first transistor (42.sub.1P2) of a first type and coupled to the first node, a first transistor (42.sub.2N2) of a second type and coupled to the second node, a second transistor (44.sub.1P2) of the first type and coupled to the second node, and a second transistor (44.sub.2N2) of the second type and coupled to the node. The system also comprises circuitry for providing, during a first time period, a first biasing signal (VNDY) and a second biasing signal (VPDY) and circuitry for providing, during a second time period, a third biasing signal (VNDX) and a fourth biasing signal (VPDX).

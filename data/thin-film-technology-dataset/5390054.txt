A digital recording system utilizing a magnetoresistive transducer in a magnetic recording head. The system measures the amplitude of an output signal, E.sub.o, from the transducer for various bias currents as a recorded magnetic media passes by the head. The system then determines the bias current for which the output signal, E.sub.o, is maximized and multiplies that bias current by a suitable factor. The system then operates at the calculated bias current level, thereby minimizing the error rate of the system.

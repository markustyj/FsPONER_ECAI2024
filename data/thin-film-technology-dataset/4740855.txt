A magnetic thin-film head with layer-wise buildup on a nonmagnetic substrate is provided for a recording medium which can be magnetized perpendicularly (vertically), and contains a conduction body which carries the magnetic flux, and the magnet legs of which form a main and an auxiliary pole. With these magnet legs which are arranged on the substrate with predetermined spacing side by side, a write/read coil winding is associated, the conductor turns of which extend through a space formed between the magnet legs. This magnetic head should be able to fly at a very small flying altitude above the recording and should at the same time be easy to realize in a thin film technique. To this end, it is provided that only the partially overlapping magnet legs serve as the magnetic conduction body, which are connected together in their common overlap zone, forming a magnetic return in a partial region and are spaced outside of this return region, forming the intermediate space for the conductors.

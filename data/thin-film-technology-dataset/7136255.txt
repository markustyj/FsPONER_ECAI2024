 The present invention provides servo systems and accompanying methods for determining the relative position of a transducer head to a magnetic storage tape utilizing the position of the magnetic storage tape edge. In one example, a method for positioning a transducer head relative to a magnetic storage medium includes optically sensing a position of an edge of the storage medium, and repositioning the transducer head relative to the storage medium based on the read signal and the position of the edge of the storage medium.

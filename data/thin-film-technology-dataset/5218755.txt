Method of manufacturing a magnetic head having a tape contact face (5) with transducing gaps, which method starts from a substrate (1) on which a magnetic head structure is formed layer by layer. A magnetic head structure comprises magnetoresistive elements (E1-E11) connected each to first connection faces (13a, 13b) by means of at least two first connection tracks (11a, 11b), and flux guides (19a, 19b) for cooperating with the magnetoresistive elements. An electrically conducting uninterrupted layer (27) extending parallel to the tape contact face to be formed is provided during formation of the magnetic head structure, which layer is interrupted locally when the tape contact face is being formed so as to define spatially separated electric conductors for biasing at least one magnetoresistive element. Each electric conductor is connected to second connection faces (17a, 17b) by means of at least two second connection tracks (15a, 15b).

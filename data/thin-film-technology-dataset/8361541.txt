 The subject matter disclosed herein provides methods for manufacturing an electronic lapping guide and a magnetic read head assembly. The magnetoresistive head assembly includes a sensing element that has a front edge and a front flux guide that has a back edge, such that the sensing element front edge and the front flux guide back edge share a common interface that defines an interface plane normal to the surface of a wafer substrate. The electronic lapping guide comprises a conductive material adapted to attach to two electrical leads for measuring a resistance through the conductive material. The conductive material may include a conductive material back edge aligned with the interface plane. The resistance of the conductive material may be inversely proportional to a conductive material length normal to the interface plane.

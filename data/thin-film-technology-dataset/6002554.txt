A multitrack coupled element read head and a method for manufacturing such a read head are provided. The multitrack coupled element read head includes multiple coupled magnetoresistive read elements in a spaced relationship, and a support structure between a pair of coupled read elements, the support structure also being a magnetoresistive material. The read head also includes a closure material bonded on the plurality of coupled read elements and the support structure, where the support structure provides for substantially even pressure on the pair of coupled read elements such that shorting therein is eliminated.

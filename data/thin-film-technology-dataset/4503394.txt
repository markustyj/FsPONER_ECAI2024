A magnetoelectric conversion element comprises a magnetoresistive effect material having a closed domain structure, a pair of contacts for supply of current flowing through the magnetoresistive effect material, and a bias electrode disposed between the contacts for biasing the direction of the current flow. The bias electrode is disposed so that the respective angles of intersection between the directions of current flow through different magnetic domains of the magnetoresistive effect material biased by the bias electrode and the directions of spontaneous magnetization biased by an external magnetic field are both increased or decreased.

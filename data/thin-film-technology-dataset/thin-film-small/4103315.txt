In thin film magnetic transducers, e.g., inductive or magnetoresistive recording heads, at least a pair of layers of a ferromagnetic material and an antiferromagnetic material are deposited upon one another and exchange coupled to retain a unidirectional bias in the plane of the ferromagnetic material. When multiple pairs of layers are used, they are separated by layers of nonmagnetic material. In some cases, successive pairs of layers of material with unidirectional bias have their directions of bias pointing in opposite directions. The domain walls in the layers of material are minimized by this technique.

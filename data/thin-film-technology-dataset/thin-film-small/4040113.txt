A magnetic head having a magnetoresistive element. The element comprises a center tap, while on the left-hand half a pattern of equipotential strips is provided at an angle with the longitudinal direction of approximately 45.degree. and on the right-hand half a pattern of equipotential strips is provided at an angle of approximately 135.degree. with the longitudinal direction. The halves are each controlled with a current source and their output signals are subtracted from each other. The relation between the resistance of the total element and the value of external magnetic fields is more linear than in known magnetic heads having a magnetoresistive element and thermal noise is eliminated.

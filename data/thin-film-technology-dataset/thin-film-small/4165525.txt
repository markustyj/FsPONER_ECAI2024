A thin-film magnetic head in which the electrically conductive magnetic material of the core is wound directly a number of times around an electrical conductor which ensures the energization of the head presents the advantage that the manufacture can take place by means of exclusively electroplating methods, since in this configuration no insulating layers are necessary between the material of the core and the conductor.

A first lead is connected to an edge of a free layer of a spin valve sensor for conducting a sense current parallel to the planes of its film surfaces after which the sense current is conducted perpendicular to the planes of the film surfaces of the remainder of the layers of the spin valve sensor to a second lead layer which may be a first shield layer of the read head. The conduction of the sense current parallel to the film surfaces of the free layer provides the spin valve sensor with sufficient resistance so as to enable processing circuitry to efficiently produce playback signals.

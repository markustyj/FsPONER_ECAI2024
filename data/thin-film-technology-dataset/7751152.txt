 A head suspension for a hard disk drive is thin from an arm to a head and involves a minimum step between the arm and a load beam. The head suspension includes a load beam that includes a rigid part and a resilient part. The load beam applies load onto a head that is arranged at a front end of the load beam to write and read data to and from a disk arranged in the hard disk drive. The head is connected to read/write wiring patterns of a flexure. The flexure supports the head and is attached to a disk-facing surface of the rigid part. An arm is attached to a carriage of the hard disk drive and is turned around a spindle. The arm supports the resilient part that is attached to a base end of the rigid part. A disk-facing surface of the arm is arranged within the total of thicknesses of the rigid part and head.

An improved disc head for increased wear protection. The disc head includes wear members 74, 76, 92, 94, formed proximate to transducer elements of a thin film head. The wear members 74, 76, 92, 94 are formed along a portion of a lower surface of the head facing the disc surface and are formed of a relatively hard material for increasing wear resistance of the head, proximate to the transducer elements 70.

An improved magnetic head for a hard disk drive including a lead overlaid read head component in which the magnetic fields of the passive region of the free magnetic layer regions are pinned. In one embodiment a thin film layer composed of a magnetic material is deposited on top of the free layer of the GMR head in the passive region beneath the overlaid electrical leads. In an alternative embodiment the passive region of the free layer is anti-parallel coupled.

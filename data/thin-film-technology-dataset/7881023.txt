 The invention provides a magnetoresistive device with the CPP (current perpendicular to plane) structure, comprising a magnetoresistive unit, and a first shield layer and a second shield layer located and formed such that the magnetoresistive unit is sandwiched between them, with a sense current applied in a stacking direction, wherein the magnetoresistive unit comprises a nonmagnetic intermediate layer, and a first ferromagnetic layer and a second ferromagnetic layer stacked and formed such that the nonmagnetic intermediate layer is interposed between them, wherein the first shield layer, and the second shield layer is controlled by magnetization direction control means in terms of magnetization direction, and the first ferromagnetic layer, and the second ferromagnetic layer receives action such that there is an antiparallel magnetization state created, in which mutual magnetizations are in opposite directions, under the influences of magnetic actions of the first shield layer and the second shield layer.

A thin film magnetic head comprises a non-magnetic oxide substrate 11 and a soft magnetic thin film 12 of an Fe-Si-Al alloy or the like laminated on the substrate 11. A reaction prevention film 40 of magnesia or an oxide material containing magnesia is formed in the interface between the substrate and soft magnetic thin film. The film 40 has a function of preventing the reaction between the substrate 11 and the thin film 12 to preclude magnetic property deterioration of the soft magnetic thin film and also reproduced output reduction and further preclude increase of the residual stress in the interface between the substrate and soft magnetic thin film, thus permitting excellent magnetic properties to be obtained.

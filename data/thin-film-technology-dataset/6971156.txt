A thin film magnetic head capable of improving a high frequency response characteristic and the efficiency of the head, and reducing the manufacturing time, and a method of manufacturing the thin film magnetic head. After laminating a precursory layer for forming a coil pattern, a precursory layer for forming a separate layer, and a precursory layer for forming a coil pattern, these layers are continuously patterned with the use of a mask by etching to selectively form the coil pattern, the separate layer and the coil pattern in a batch process. The number of the manufacturing steps (the number of photolithography processes) is reduced compared with the case where the coil pattern, the separate layer, and the coil pattern are formed by plating in separate processes, so that a thin film coil comprising the coil patterns can be formed in a shorter time.

 A transducer includes a first layer that is selectively deposited in a contact region to form a core, and selectively deposited in a transducer region to form a first element of the transducer. The transducer includes an electrically conductive magnetic deposit. The electrically conductive magnetic deposit forms a sidewall on the core. The electrically conductive magnetic deposit forms a second element of the transducer in the transducer region. The second element of the transducer has a planarized surface that is coplanar with a planarized surface of the sidewall.

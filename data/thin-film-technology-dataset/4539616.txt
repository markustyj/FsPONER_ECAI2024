Herein disclosed is a thin film magnetic head which is so constructed that a conductor layer arranged in a non-magnetic insulating layer isolating two magnetic poles and adapted to form a coil of plural turns has a height made larger than the width and gap thereof. A method of fabricating that head includes the step of forming a non-magnetic insulating layer, the step of etching the insulating layer by using a mask layer formed thereover as a mask, the step of depositing a metal for providing a conductor layer, the step of removing the mask layer together with the metal thereover, and the step forming a coating of a non-magnetic insulating layer thereover, thereby to form the conductor layer. The head thus fabricated has its magnetic recording and reproducing characteristics improved.

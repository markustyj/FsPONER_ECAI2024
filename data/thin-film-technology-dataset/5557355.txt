A magnetic head for a camera having a track-forming portion for at least reading information from a magnetic memory region of a film associated with the camera wherein the track forming portion includes an improved core forming a magnetic circuit and having a pair of pole pieces characterized in that each of the pole pieces is generally flat with arms extending to one side of spaced coil winding areas and the pole pieces are placed at a substantial angle with ends of front and rear arms of the two pole pieces closely opposed, the front pair of ends being spaced to form a non-magnetic gap. Thickness of the magnetic circuit near the gap is reduced by recesses in the adjacent front arms preferably filled by non-magnetic inserts that support the narrowed arms during contouring of the ends to further define the gap depth and form a contact surface for the film track. Angling of the pole pieces provides a low height core with coils lying parallel with the film surface but made from simple flat pole elements. Angling of the opposing ends of the rear arms increases contact area of the arm ends for improved core efficiency.

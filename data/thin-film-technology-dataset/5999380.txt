A thin-film head has patterned pole tips (68) and a smooth interface topography (70) which eliminates the accumulation of foreign material around the pole tips (68). The patterned pole tips (68) are formed by removing material to obtain a desired pole tip shape. Fill material is added and reduced to produce a smooth surface topography (70).

A recording head includes at least one magnetic pole and magnetic side shields adjacent to the pole, the side shields disposed to shield the pole from adjacent tracks on a magnetic medium. Embodiments are disclosed for both longitudinal and vertical recording in monopole, two-pole, and three-pole heads, including inductive, MR and Hall-type read elements. A magnetic head capable of detecting flux from a target source among a group of sources, includes at least one magnetic pole and a magnetic shield, the shield providing to the pole 360.degree. of magnetic shielding against sensing by the pole of flux other than the target source. Also disclosed is an alternate flux return conductor being separated at the pole tip from the shield section by a non-magnetic insulation layer. A shielded magnetic head may have two outer magnetic poles, the two outer poles acting as the magnetic shield for a center pole, whereby the outer poles can be used for writing and the center pole can be used for reading.

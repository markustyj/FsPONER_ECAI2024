A magnetoresistant transducer is described for reading very high-density a. The magnetoresistant transducer (TMRI) includes at least one magnetoresistor (MRI) of an anisotropic magnetic material placed perpendicular to the direction in which the data of a medium (SM) pass. The axis (AFAI) of easy magnetization of the magnetoresistor is normal to the medium and includes a thin, mono-range or single domain magnetic anisotropic layer (CI) normal to the medium and to the direction in which the data pass. The mono-range or single domain layer is strongly coupled magnetically with the magnetoresistor, and its axis of easy magnetization (AFACI) is normal to the medium and opposite in direction to the axis of easy magnetization of the magnetoresistor. The invention is particularly applicable to the reading of magnetic tapes and disks containing high density data.

A thin film magnetic head that reduces the coil resistance of the coil layer formed between core layers is formed by increasing the conductor width at a fixed ratio from the inner to the outer side of the coil layer in the conductor width of each turn. The conductor width on the front side with respect to a base end portion of an upper core layer is smaller than the conductor width on the rear side with respect to the base end portion, whereby it is possible to reduce the coil resistance value of the entire coil layer. Further, using a change in conductor width, it is possible to increase the magnetic efficiency of the magnetic head compared to conventional magnetic heads.

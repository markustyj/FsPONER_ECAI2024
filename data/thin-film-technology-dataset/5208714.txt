An interleaved head for reading and writing data transitions onto a magnetic tape. A magnetic recording system for the bi-directional transportation of the tape media across the interleaved head. A controller controls the tape drive in a reel-to-reel format to accomplish the bi-directional motion of the tape media. The interleaved head includes two modules with each module having a plurality of alternating read and write transducers alternately spaced apart along a single line placed transverse to the movement of the magnetic tape. The two modules are placed together such that the write gaps of one module are aligned with the read gaps of the other module. Each read module includes the magneto-resistive element. Each write transducer includes a thin film conductor driving a nickel zinc ferrite substrate as one pole piece and a nickel zinc closure piece as the second pole piece. In order to provide leveling across the write transducers of the module, write back gap islands are provided in the back gap regions of the write transducer made of the same material with the same thickness as the magneto resistive element and the conductors interconnecting the magneto resistive element to the read/write network of the tape drive.

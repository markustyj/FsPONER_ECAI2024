A lapping sensor used in fabrication of a magnetic head with an MR element includes a resistor film with a resistance that varies depending upon a lapping amount, and a pair of connection pads formed on a element-forming surface of the magnetic head and electrically connected to both end sections of the resistor film. The pair of connection pads consist of a first connection pad and a second connection pad located nearer to a lapping surface than the first connection pad. One edge of the first connection pad is faced to one edge of the second connection pad and inclined toward the lapping surface.

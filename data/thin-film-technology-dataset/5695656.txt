A magnetic thin-film head fabrication method which improves the yield of the thin-film head by reducing the deviation of line widths for various regions of a pole layer includes the steps of forming an upper pole layer on a to-be-etched magnet-forming layer formed on a lower pole layer, forming a metallic seed layer on the upper pole layer, forming an insulating layer having an aperture corresponding to a desired pattern on the seed layer, forming a metal mask layer on the exposed plane of the seed layer by a plating method, removing the insulating layer and etching the exposed portion of the magnet-forming layer which is not covered by the metal mask layer to a predetermined depth. Since the pattern of the metal mask layer can be changed easily and precisely by the shape of the photoresist layer, the size deviation of the processed products due to processing error for each product is reduced, thereby maximizing the reproducibility of the upper pole layer. Consequently, the deterioration rate of the completed magnetic thin-film head is minimized, and the performance difference between the products is reduced.

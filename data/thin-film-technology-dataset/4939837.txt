A process for the batch fabrication of an array of shielded magnetoresistive (MR) read transducers comprising the steps of depositing a full film over the entire substrate of a first magnetic shield layer, a first non-magnetic gap layer and sputter depositing a layer of MR sensor material in the presence of a magnetic field for orienting the anisotropy axes of the layers of MR sensor material in a chosen direction. The MR sensor layer and the first gap layer are permitted to produce a plurality of MR read transducers, and the first magnetic shield layer is then patterned to produce a first shield for each of the MR read transducers. A second gap layer and a second shield layer are patterned to produce a second shield for each of the MR read transducers.

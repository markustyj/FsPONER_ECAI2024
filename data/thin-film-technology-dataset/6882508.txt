A thin-film magnetic head comprises a read head and a write head. The read head and the write head are placed such that a top shield layer of the read head and a bottom pole layer of the write head are opposed to each other. A magnetism intercepting layer is provided between the top shield layer and the bottom pole layer. The magnetism intercepting layer is made of a nonmagnetic metal material that is capable of being formed through plating, such as platinum. The top shield layer, the magnetism intercepting layer and the bottom pole layer are consecutively formed through plating.

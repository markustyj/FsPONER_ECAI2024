 A device comprises a mounting surface configured to mount a head gimbal assembly (HGA), a housing that pivots relative to the mounting surface, and a mechanism coupled to the housing that deflects the HGA when the housing pivots relative to the mounting surface. For example the mechanism may be a pneumatically actuated finger that pulls the HGA towards the housing. The device may be used to load the HGA on a rotating test disc. Once loaded on the test disc, the HGA is supported only by the mounting surface and an air bearing at an interface of a slider of the HGA and the test disc. Embodiments of the invention may provide precise and repeatable positioning of the HGA because dimensional tolerances and vibrations in the mechanism are not transferred to the HGA once it is loaded on the test disc.

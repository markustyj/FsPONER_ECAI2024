A novel thin film magnetic head is provided characterized by the use of a new substrate material excellent in mechanical property as well as machinability. This substrate is composed of a ceramic compact comprising 4 to 45% by volume of Component A, 55 to 96% by volume of Component B and at most 3% by volume of unavoidable impurities:Component A: at least one member selected from the group consisting of carbides, nitrides, carbonitrides, carboxides, oxynitrides and carboxynitrides of Group IVa, Va and VIa elements of Periodic Table and mixtures or solid solutions thereof.Component B: ZrO.sub.2 consisting of at least 70% by weight of tetragonal and/or cubic system and the balance of monoclinic system, in which at least one member selected from the group consisting of oxides of Group IIIa elements of Periodic Table, CaO and MgO, and mixtures thereof is dissolved to form a solid solution.

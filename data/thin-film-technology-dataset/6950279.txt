A thin-film magnetic head comprises a medium facing surface, a bottom pole layer, a top pole layer, a recording gap layer, and a thin-film coil. The bottom pole layer and the top pole layer are coupled to each other via a coupling portion located away from the medium facing surface. The coupling portion has an end face facing toward the medium facing surface. The end face includes a curved surface convex toward the medium facing surface. The thin-film coil has a conductive layer of three turns disposed around the coupling portion. The first turn of the conductive layer from an inner side thereof includes a portion disposed between the end face of the coupling portion and the medium facing surface. This portion has a minimum width of the conductive layer at a position on a virtual line connecting the end face of the coupling portion and the medium facing surface in the shortest distance, and increases in width with distance from the virtual line.

A magnetic thin film head having a laminated structure includes a non-magnetic substrate, a lower magnetic layer deposited on the non-magnetic substrate, a magnetic gap layer overlying the lower magnetic layer, at least two insulating layers overlying the magnetic gap layer, at least one electrically conductive layer interposed between the insulating layers, and an upper magnetic layer overlying the insulating layers. A magnetic core of the magnetic thin film head is made up of the upper and lower magnetic layers, at least one of which includes a plurality of magnetically soft layers plated with a metal alloy and a plurality of modified layers each interposed between two adjoining magnetically soft layers. The modified layers function to magnetostatically separate the magnetically soft layers. Each of the modified layers is made by introducing, during electroplating, an anodic dissolution process wherein a surface to be plated is temporarily used as an anode.

The thin film of the invention for use in a magnetic head has an atomic ratio composition of the formula:wherein M is at least one member selected from the group consisting of Mg, Ca, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, and B, 6.ltoreq.x.ltoreq.14, 6.2.ltoreq.y.ltoreq.15, 0.6.ltoreq.y/x.ltoreq.2.0, and 0.ltoreq.z.ltoreq.10, and has a relative intensity ratio of Fe (200) peak to Fe (110) peak in an X-ray diffraction spectrum of at least 1 and high Fe (100) orientation, with a film surface oriented in (200) plane. Heat treatment improves the (100) orientation. The thin film has very high heat resistance of remaining stable at 700.degree. C. or higher and excellent soft magnetic properties in that it has a high saturation magnetic flux density Bs, a low coercive force, a high magnetic permeability, and minimized magnetostriction. It is hard enough. The thin film exhibits improved soft magnetic properties immediately after its preparation which experience a limited range of variation with a change of heat treating conditions so that the control of heat treatment is easy. A magnetic head using such a thin film has improved overwrite properties, recording/reproducing sensitivity, and electromagnetic properties, and is highly reliable.

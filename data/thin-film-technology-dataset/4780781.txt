A thin film magnetic head comprising a lower magnetic film, an upper magnetic film which is formed over the lower magnetic film and in which one end is come into contact with one end of the lower magnetic film and the other end faces the other end of the lower magnetic film through a magnetic gap and thereby forming a magnetic circuit which has a magnetic gap in a part thereof, together with the lower magnetic film, and a conductor coil forming a coil of a predetermined number of turns and passing between the upper and lower magnetic films and crossing the magnetic circuit. Each of the upper and lower magnetic films is formed of a Co-Ni-Fe ternary alloy having a face-centered cubic crystal structure. Also, uniaxial anisotropy is alternately and perpendicularly given in every layer of a predetermined thickness stacked in the direction of thickness of the film.

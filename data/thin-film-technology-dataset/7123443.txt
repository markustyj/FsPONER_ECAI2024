 The present invention includes an overplated component which includes an enlarged mushroom head having outer portions which overhang a hard baked resist layer. The device is ultimately encapsulated such that no voids and/or redeposition problems exist under the overhang due to the presence of the hard baked resist. While not intended to be limiting in any manner, a device of the present invention is a thin film magnetic head wherein the yoke portion of a magnetic pole is formed utilizing the mushroom plating techniques of the present invention. Another mushroom plated component found in many devices is a mushroom plated electrical interconnecting stud that is formed utilizing the process steps of the present invention.

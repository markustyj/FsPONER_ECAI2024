A magnetoresistive sensor includes a magnetic field detecting portion composed of a ferromagnetic thin film formed on one side of an insulating rectangular substrate, at least two terminal electrode portions and wiring portions. In the magnetoresistive sensor, the surface level of at least two corner portions is lower than that of the surface portion of the substrate other than at least two corner portions on the one side of the substrate, the at least two terminal electrode portions are separately formed at the corner portions having the lower surface level and the magnetic field detecting portion composed of the ferromagnetic thin film is formed on a portion of the surface of the substrate other than the at least two corner portions. In the magnetoresistive sensor, the terminal electrode portions are formed on the corner portions of the substrate whose level is lower than that of the surface on which the magnetic field detecting portion is formed and accordingly, when a resin mold is applied for the purpose of reinforcing the bonded portions, the resin mold can be formed such that the surface level of the molded portion is almost equal to that of the surface on which the magnetic field detecting portion is formed.

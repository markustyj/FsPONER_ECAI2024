A combination magnetic head includes a reading head portion and a writing head portion successively stacked on a substrate. A magnetic shield layer is formed on a portion of the substrate between a recessed portion formed in a surface of the substrate and an air bearing surface. A shield gap layer with a magnetoresistive reproducing element embedded therein is formed on the magnetic shield layer. A first magnetic layer has a pole portion formed on the shield gap layer and an extended portion extending along a bottom wall of the recessed portion. A thin film coil has a portion provided on the extended portion and fully embedded within the recessed portion such that the portion of the thin film coil is closer to the substrate than the reproducing element.

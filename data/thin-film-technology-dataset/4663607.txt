A magnetroresistive element formed by laminating a plurality of metallic magnetoresistance effect films having magnetostriction of different signs on a substrate. The magnetoresistive element can be formed to exhibit zero magnetostriction or to exhibit magnetostriction of any desired value. Further, the magnetoresistive element exhibits magnetostriction that changes little with the change in the film composition. The metallic magnetoresistance effect films preferably have positive and negative magnetostriction with an absolute value not greater than 15.times.10.sup.-6.

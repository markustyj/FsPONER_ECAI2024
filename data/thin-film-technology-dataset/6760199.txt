A magnetic head assembly with an air bearing surface (ABS) layer over a double-shielded magnetoresistive (MR) sensor and a write gap formed between two spaced magnetic pole tips, with an optional write-gap shield disposed so that one magnetic pole tip is disposed between the write-gap shield and the other magnetic pole tip. At least one of the MR element shields is electrically connected to one of the MR signal lead conductors (preferably the one having the most positive potential) and the one magnetic pole tip (and/or the optional write-gap shield) is coupled to the clamped MR element shield with an electrical conductor. For multi-track read/write arrays, the connection between adjacent reader shield and writer pole and/or shield is provided independently for each read/write pair in the array, thereby equalizing the voltage environments to reduce variations in the chemical/mechanical erosion of the read and write head ABS layers.

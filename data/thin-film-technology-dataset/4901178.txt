A thin film magnetic head whereby the inclined surface is formed with a prescribed angle relative to the upper surface of the substrate in the vicinity of a slide contact surface thereof with a magnetic recording medium, the magnetic gap is formed on the magnetic film on the inclined surface, and the azimuth of the magnetic gap is set by the inclined surface.By forming grooves or protrusions on the substrate, the inclined surface by which the azimuth of the magnetic gap is set is defined. A coil conductor is formed on the flat portion of the upper surface of the substrate.With the thin film magnetic head presented by this invention, a double azimuth thin film magnetic head of a multi-channel thin film magnetic head can be easily provided.

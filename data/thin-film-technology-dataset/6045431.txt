Improved manufacture of thin-film magnetic heads includes a piezoelectric driven actuator for bending row tools used in the mass manufacture of magnetic heads. The actuator is independent of the row tool and includes a lever arm which structurally deflects when driven by the piezoelectric element, converting physical displacement of the piezoelectric element to a force supplied to the row tool, through a portion of the lever arm arranged to undergo deflection. Arrays of piezoelectric actuators are also disclosed for individual adjustment of each magnetic head component of a row being polished.

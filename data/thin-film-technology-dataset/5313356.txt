A thin film magnetic head includes a magnetic core composed of upper and lower magnetic pole films spaced apart to define a read-write gap and a coil disposed between the upper and lower magnetic pole films in an area outside of the gap. The upper and lower magnetic pole films each comprise a thin-film laminate having alternating magnetic and non-magnetic thin films. The magnetic thin film includes an amorphous Co alloy having a soft magnetic property and a thickness within a range of 0.1 .mu.m to 0.5 .mu.m and the non-magnetic thin-film includes a non-magnetic metal or an insulating nitride.

 Components of a plurality of magnetic heads are formed on a single substrate to fabricate a magnetic head substructure in which a plurality of pre-head portions are aligned in a plurality of rows. The substructure is cut to separate the plurality of pre-head portions from one another, and the plurality of magnetic heads are thereby fabricated. The surface formed by cutting the substructure is lapped to form a lapped surface. The lapped surface is lapped so as to reach a target position of a medium facing surface. The substructure incorporates first to fourth resistor elements each of which detects the position of the lapped surface. The third and fourth detection elements are located at positions shifted from the first and second resistor elements along the direction orthogonal to the medium facing surface.

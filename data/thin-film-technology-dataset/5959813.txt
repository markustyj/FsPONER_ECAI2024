The present invention provides a combination read/write thin film magnetic head wherein the width of a gap layer is the same as the track width Tw, and a shielding magnetic layer of a soft magnetic material is formed on both sides of the gap layer so that blots of a record magnetic field out of the track width Tw can be absorbed by the shielding magnetic layer, and write fringing can be prevented. Particularly, when the saturation magnetic flux density and thickness of the shielding magnetic layer are appropriately adjusted, it is possible to suppress write fringing, and at the same time maintain reproduced output at a high level.

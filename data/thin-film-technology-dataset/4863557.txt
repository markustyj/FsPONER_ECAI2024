Disclosed herein are a pattern forming process, particularly the one by lithography for fine fabrication, and a thin-film magnetic head formed by said process. The present invention provides a process for accurately fabricating a substrate having a stepped surface by dry etching, using as the mask a resist film formed by plasma polymerization. Plasma polymerization forms a uniform photosensitive resist film on a stepped surface, and the resist film can be used as the mask for the ion milling of the substrate.

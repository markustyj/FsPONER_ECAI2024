A thin film magnetic head is carried in a recessed region which is etched in a basecoat. The thin film magnetic head includes upper and lower pole pieces having an upper pole tip and a lower pole tip, respectively. The upper and lower pole tips form a magnetic flux gap. Electrical conductors are carried in an insulating layer between the upper and lower pole pieces. The magnetic flux gap defines a plane which is generally parallel with a plane defined by the conductors. The electrical conductors lie on either side of the plane.

 A thin-film magnetic head includes a first magnetic core, a second magnetic core, a connecting layer which connects the first magnetic core and the second magnetic core, a toroidal coil layer, and a shielding layer. The connecting layer extends in the height direction so as to face the back side in the height direction of the shielding layer. Alternatively, the width in the track width direction of the connecting layer is larger than the width in the track width direction of the toroidal coil layer. Consequently, the volume of the connecting layer is increased, and thereby the heat capacity is increased. Heat generated in the thin-film magnetic head can be properly dissipated via the connecting layer, and an increase in the temperature inside the thin-film magnetic head can be prevented. As a result, protrusion of the thin-film magnetic head due to thermal expansion can be prevented.

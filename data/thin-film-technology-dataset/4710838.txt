A magnetic thin-film head with layer-wise build-up on a nonmagnetic substrate for a recording medium which can be magnetized vertically, comprises a ring head-like conduction body for carrying magnetic flux having two magnet legs, of which the end pole pieces facing the recording medium have, respectively, a predetermined small width transverse to the direction of motion and change into widening leg parts a space being provided between the two magnet legs through which the turns of a write/read coil winding extend. A magnetic head having highly efficient write and read functions is thereby obtained. The vertical length (gap height h) of one of the two end pole pieces is relatively small, while the corresponding length (l) of the other end pole piece is several times the former, and a widening leg part of the magnet leg with the comparatively shorter vertical end pole piece is provided with a recess which extends along its center line lying in the conduction direction of the magnetic flux and extends at least approximately to the shorter end pole piece.

 An assembly for testing a head gimbal assembly (HGA) comprises a support platform configured to hold a base plate of the HGA. A base plate of the HGA is mounted on the support platform. The assembly further comprises a channel with an opening adjacent to a tail of the HGA and a vacuum source connected the channel. The vacuum source creates a negative pressure in the channel to secure the tail of the HGA to the opening of the channel. Embodiments of the invention may be useful to inhibit vibration in the tail of an HGA, which may also reduce vibration in the head of the HGA. Reducing vibration in the head of the HGA may increase the accuracy and precision of tests performed on the HGA using the assembly.

 A method for testing head gimbal assemblies includes picking a first head gimbal assembly and holding the first head gimbal assembly with a first an end effector. The first end effector and the picked head gimbal assembly are positioned adjacent a nest using at least one actuator, and the first picked head gimbal assembly is released from the end effector to the nest. The first head gimbal assembly is tested on the nest by reading from and/or writing to a rotating disc. A second head gimbal assembly is held with a second end effector at the same time the first end effector holds the first head gimbal assembly.

The invention provides a thin film magnetic head including a first pole portion having depressed portion that is formed therein. The depressed portion descends, backward within the first pole portion, at a first inclination angle .theta.1 from a first inclination starting point P1. Then, an insulating film is filled up in the depressed portion so that it can be located up to the upper side of the surface of the first pole and have an inclined surface in the side of a medium opposing surface. Additionally, a first magnetic film of a second pole portion can have a larger saturated magnetic flux density than a second magnetic film of the second pole portion, and can include an inclined portion with a second inclination angle .theta.2 from a second inclination starting point P2.

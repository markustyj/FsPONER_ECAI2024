A magnetoresistive layered structure having on a substrate two or more magnetoresistive, anisotropic ferromagnetic thin-films each two of which are separated by an intermediate layer on a substrate of less than 50 .ANG. thickness formed of a substantially nonmagnetic, conductive alloy having two immiscible components therein. A further component to provide temperature stability in some circumstances is to be at least partially miscible in the first two components. Such structures can be formed as a sensor by having them electrically connected together with one positioned in a gap between magnetic material masses and one shielded by one of such masses. The magnetic material mass being used for shielding can be divided into two masses with one of those masses farthest from the gap serving as the shield.

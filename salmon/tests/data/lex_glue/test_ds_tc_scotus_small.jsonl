{"text":"405 U.S. 625\n92 S.Ct. 1221\n31 L.Ed.2d 536\nClaude ALEXANDER, Petitioner,v.State of LOUISIANA.\nNo. 70\u20145026.\nArgued Dec. 6 and 7, 1971.\nDecided April 3, 1972.\n\nSyllabus\nPetitioner, a Negro, attacks his rape conviction in Lafayette Parish, which was affirmed by the Louisiana Supreme Court, contending that the grand jury selection procedures followed in his case were invidiously discriminatory against Negroes and, because of a statutory exemption provision, against women. The jury commissioners (all white) sent out questionnaires (including a space for racial designation) to those on a list compiled from nonracial sources. Of the 7,000-odd returns, 1,015 (14%) were from Negroes, though Negroes constituted 21% of the parish population presumptively eligible for grand jury service. By means of two culling-out procedures, when racial identifications that the commissioners had attached to the forms were plainly visible, the pool was reduced to 400, of whom 27 (7%) were Negro, from which group the 20-man grand jury venires were drawn. Petitioner's venire included one Negro (5%), and the grand jury that indicted him had none. There was no evidence of conscious racial selection and one commissioner testified that race was no consideration. Held:\n1. Petitioner made out a prima facie case of invidious racial discrimination in the selection of the grand jury that indicted him\u2014not only on a statistical basis but by a showing that the selection procedures were not racially neutral\u2014and the State, which did not adequately explain the disproportionately low number of Negroes throughout the selection process, did not meet the burden of rebutting the presumption of unconstitutionality in the procedures used. Cf. Avery v. Georgia, 345 U.S. 559, 73 S.Ct. 891, 97 L.Ed. 1244; Whitus v. Georgia, 385 U.S. 545, 87 S.Ct. 643, 17 L.Ed.2d 599. Pp. 628\u2014632.\n2. Petitioner's contentions regarding discrimination against women in the selection of grand jurors are not reached. Pp. 633 634.\n255 La. 941, 233 So.2d 891, reversed.\nCharles Stephen Ralston, New York City, for petitioner.\nBertrand De Blanc, Lafayette, La., for respondent.\nMr. Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nAfter a jury trial in the District Court for the Fifteenth Judicial District of Lafayette Parish, Louisiana, petitioner, a Negro, was convicted of rape and sentenced to life imprisonment. His conviction was affirmed on appeal by the Louisiana Supreme Court,1 and this Court granted certiorari.2 Prior to trial, petitioner had moved to quash the indictment because (1) Negro citizens were included on the grand jury list and venire in only token numbers, and (2) female citizens were systematically excluded from the grand jury list, venire, and impaneled grand jury.3 Petitioner therefore argued that the indictment against him was invalid because it was returned by a grand jury impaneled from a venire made up contrary to the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Petitioner's motions were denied.\n\n\n2\nAccording to 1960 U.S. census figures admitted into evidence below, Lafayette Parish contained 44,986 persons over 21 years of age and therefore presumptively eligible for grand jury service;4 of this total, 9,473 persons (21.06%) were Negro.5 At the hearing on petitioner's motions to quash the indictment, the evidence revealed that the Lafayette Parish jury commission consisted of five members, all of whom were white, who had been appointed by the court. The commission compiled a list of names from various sources (telephone directory, city directory, voter registration rolls, lists prepared by the school board, and by the jury commissioners themselves) and sent questionnaires to the persons on this list to determine those qualified for grand jury service. The questionnaire included a space to indicate the race of the recipient. Through this process, 7,374 questionnaires were returned, 1,015 of which (13.76%) were from Negroes,6 and the jury commissioners attached to each questionnaire an information card designating, among other things, the race of the person, and a white slip indicating simply the name and address of the person. The commissioners then culled out about 5,000 questionnaires, ostensibly on the ground that these persons were not qualified for grand jury service or were exempted under state law. The remaining 2,000 sets of papers were placed on a table, and the papers of 400 persons were selected, purportedly at random, and placed in a box from which the grand jury panels of 20 for Lafayette Parish were drawn. Twenty-seven of the persons thus selected were Negro (6.75%).7 On petitioner's grand jury venire, one of the 20 persons drawn was Negro (5%), but none of the 12 persons on the grand jury that indicted him, drawn from this 20, was Negro.\n\n\n3\n* For over 90 years, it has been established that a criminal conviction of a Negro cannot stand under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if it is based on an indictment of a grand jury from which Negroes were excluded by reason of their race. Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 25 L.Ed. 664 (1880); Neal v. Delaware, 103 U.S. 370, 26 L.Ed. 567 (1881). Although a defendant has no right to demand that members of his race be included on the grand jury that indicts him, Virginia v. Rives, 100 U.S. 313, 25 L.Ed. 667 (1880), he is entitled to require that the State not deliberately and systematically deny to members of his race the right to participate as jurors in the administration of justice.8 Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 25 L.Ed. 676 (1880); Gibson v. Mississippi, 162 U.S. 565, 16 S.Ct. 904, 40 L.Ed. 1075 (1896). Cf. Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.S. 475, 74 S.Ct. 667, 98 L.Ed. 866 (1954). It is only the application of these settled principles that is at issue here.\n\n\n4\nThis is not a case where it is claimed that there have been no Negroes called for service within the last 30 years, Patton v. Mississippi, 332 U.S. 463, 464, 68 S.Ct. 184, 185, 92 L.Ed. 76 (1947); only one Negro chosen within the last 40 years, Pierre v. Louisiana, 306 U.S. 354, at 359, 59 S.Ct. 536, at 539 (1939); or no Negroes selected 'within the memory of witnesses who had lived (in the area) all their lives,' Norris v. Alabama, 294 U.S. 587, 591, 55 S.Ct. 579, 581, 79 L.Ed. 1074 (1935). Rather, petitioner argues that, in his case, there has been a consistent process of progressive and disproportionate reduction of the number of Negroes eligible to serve on the grand jury at each stage of the selection process until ultimately an all-white grand jury was selected to indict him.\n\n\n5\nIn Lafayette Parish, 21% of the population was Negro and 21 or over, therefore presumptively eligible for grand jury service. Use of questionnaires by the jury commissioners created a pool of possible grand jurors which was 14% Negro, a reduction by one-third of possible black grand jurors. The commissioners then twice culled this group to create a list of 400 prospective jurors, 7% of whom were Negro\u2014a further reduction by one-half. The percentage dropped to 5% on petitioner's grand jury venire and to zero on the grand jury that actually indicted him. Against this background, petitioner argues that the substantial disparity between the proportion of blacks chosen for jury duty and the proportion of blacks in the eligible population raises a strong inference that racial discrimination and not chance has produced this result because elementary principles of probability make it extremely unlikely that a random selection process would, at each stage, have so consistently reduced the number of Negroes.9\n\n\n6\nThis Court has never announced mathematical standards for the demonstration of 'systematic' exclusion of blacks but has, rather, emphasized that a factual inquiry is necessary in each case that takes into account all possible explanatory factors. The progressive decimation of potential Negro grand jurors is indeed striking here, but we do not rest our conclusion that petitioner has demonstrated a prima facie case of invidious racial discrimination on statistical improbability alone, for the selection procedures themselves were not racially neutral. The racial designation on both the questionnaire and the information card provided a clear and easy opportunity for racial discrimination. At two crucial steps in the selection process, when the number of returned questionnaires was reduced to 2,000 and when the final selection of the 400 names was made, these racial identifications were visible on the forms used by the jury commissioners, although there is no evidence that the commissioners consciously selected by race. The situation here is thus similar to Avery v. Georgia, 345 U.S. 559, 73 S.Ct. 891, 97 L.Ed. 1244 (1953), where the Court sustained a challenge to an array of petit jurors in which the names of prospective jurors had been selected from segregated tax lists. Juror cards were prepared from these lists, yellow cards being used for Negro citizens and white cards for whites. Cards were drawn by a judge, and there was no evidence of specific discrimination. The Court held that such evidence was unnecessary, however, given the fact that no Negroes had appeared on the final jury: 'Obviously that practice makes it easier for those to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate.' 345 U.S., at 562, 73 S.Ct., at 892. Again, in Whitus v. Georgia, 385 U.S. 545, 87 S.Ct. 643, 17 L.Ed.2d 599 (1967), the Court reversed the conviction of a defendant who had been tried before an all-white petit jury. Jurors had been selected from a one-volume tax digest divided into separate sections of Negroes and whites; black taxpayers also had a '(c)' after their names as required by Georgia law at the time. The jury commissioners testified that they were not aware of the '(c)' appearing after the names of the Negro taxpayers; that they had never included or excluded anyone because of race; that they had placed on the jury list only those persons whom they knew personally; and that the jury list they compiled had had no designation of race on it. The county from which jury selection was made was 42% Negro, and 27% of the county's taxpayers were Negro. Of the 33 persons drawn for the grand jury panel, three (9%) were Negro, while on the 19-member grand jury only one was Negro; on the 90-man venire from which the petit jury was selected, there were seven Negros (8%), but no Negroes appeared on the actual jury that tried petitioner. The Court held that this combination of factors constituted a prima facie case of discrimination, and a similar conclusion is mandated in the present case.\n\n\n7\nOnce a prima facie case of invidious discrimination is established, the burden of proof shifts to the State to rebut the presumption of unconstitutional action by showing that permissible racially neutral selection criteria and procedures have produced the monochromatic result. Turner v. Fouche, 396 U.S. 346, 361, 90 S.Ct. 532, 540, 24 L.Ed.2d 567 (1970); Eubanks v. Louisiana, 356 U.S. 584, 587, 78 S.Ct. 970, 973, 2 L.Ed.2d 991 (1958). The State has not carried this burden in this case; it has not adequately explained the elimination of Negroes during the process of selecting the grand jury that indicted petitioner. As in Whitus v. Georgia, supra, the clerk of the court, who was also a member of the jury commission, testified that no consideration was given to race during the selection procedure. App. 34. The Court has squarely held, however, that affirmations of good faith in making individual selections are insufficient to dispel a prima facie case of systematic exclusion. Turner v. Fouche, supra, 396 U.S., at 361, 90 S.Ct., at 540; Jones v. Georgia, 389 U.S. 24, 25, 88 S.Ct. 4, 5, 19 L.Ed.2d 25 (1967); Sims v. Georgia, 389 U.S. 404, 407, 88 S.Ct. 523, 525, 19 L.Ed.2d 634 (1967). 'The result bespeaks discrimination, whether or not it was a conscious decision on the part of any individual jury commissioner.' Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.S., at 482, 74 S.Ct., at 672. See also Norris v. Alabama, 294 U.S., at 598, 55 S.Ct., at 583. The clerk's testimony that the mailing list for questionnaires was compiled from nonracial sources is not, in itself, adequate to meet the State's burden of proof, for the opportunity to discriminate was presented at later stages in the process. The commissioners, in any event, had a duty 'not to pursue a course of conduct in the administration of their office which would operate to discriminate in the selection of jurors on racial grounds.' Hill v. Texas, 316 U.S. 400, 404, 62 S.Ct. 1159, 1161, 86 L.Ed. 1559 (1942). See also Smith v. Texas, 311 U.S. 128, 130, 61 S.Ct. 164, 165, 85 L.Ed. 84 (1940). Cf. Carter v. Jury Commission of Greene County, 396 U.S. 320, 330, 90 S.Ct. 518, 523, 24 L.Ed.2d 549 (1970). We conclude, therefore, that 'the opportunity for discrimination was present and (that it cannot be said) on this record that it was not resorted to by the commissioners.' Whitus v. Georgia, supra, 385 U.S., at 552, 87 S.Ct., at 647.\n\nII\n\n8\nPetitioner also challenges the Louisiana statutory exemption of women who do not volunteer for grand jury service. Article 402, La.Code Crim.Proc. This claim is novel in this Court and, when urged by a male, finds no support in our past cases. The strong constitutional and statutory policy against racial discrimination has permitted Negro defendants in criminal cases to challenge the systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand juries that indicted them. Also, those groups arbitrarily excluded from grand or petit jury service are themselves afforded an appropriate remedy. Cf. Carter v. Jury Commission of Greene County, supra. But there is nothing in past adjudications suggesting that petitioner himself has been denied equal protection by the alleged exclusion of women from grand jury service. Although the Due Process Clause guarantees petitioner a fair trial, it does not require the States to observe the Fifth Amendment's provision for presentment or indictment by a grand jury. In Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968), the Court held that because trial by jury in criminal cases under the Sixth Amendment is 'fundamental to the American scheme of justice,' id., at 149, 88 S.Ct., at 1447, such a rigth was guaranteed to defendants in state courts by the Fourteenth Amendment, but the Court has never held that federal concepts of a 'grand jury,' binding on the federal courts under the Fifth Amendment, are obligatory for the States. Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516, 538, 4 S.Ct. 111, 122, 28 L.Ed. 232 (1884).\n\n\n9\nAgainst this background and because petitioner's conviction has been set aside on other grounds, we follow our usual custom of avoiding decision of constitutional issues unnecessary to the decision of the case before us. Burton v. United States, 196 U.S. 283, 295, 25 S.Ct. 243, 245, 49 L.Ed. 482 (1905). See Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288, 346\u2014348, 56 S.Ct. 466, 482\u2014483, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). The State may or may not recharge petitioner, a properly constituted grand jury may or may not return another indictment, and petitioner may or may not be convicted again. See Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187, 196, 67 S.Ct. 261, 265, 91 L.Ed. 181 (1946).\n\n\n10\nReversed.\n\n\n11\nMr. Justice POWELL and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n12\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, concurring.\n\n\n13\nWhile I join Part I of the Court's opinion, I am convinced we should also reach the constitutionality of Louisiana's exclusion of women from jury service. The issue is squarely presented, it has been thoroughly briefed and argued, and it is of recurring importance. The Court purports to follow 'our usual custom' of avoiding unnecessary constitutional issues. But that cannot be the sole rationale, for both questions are of constitutional dimension. We could just as well say that deciding the constitutionality of excluding women from juries renders it unnecessary to reach the question of racial exclusion.\n\n\n14\nIt can be argued that the racial exclusion admits of the 'easier' analysis. But this Court does not sit to decide only 'easy' questions. And even when faced with 'hard' constitutional questions, we have often decided cases on alternate grounds where a decision on only one would have been dispositive. See, e.g., Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 92 S.Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274.\n\n\n15\nPetitioner complains of the exclusion of blacks and women from the grand jury which indicted him. Conceivably, he could have also complained of the exclusion of several other minority groups. Would he then be relegated to suffer repetitive re-indictment and re-conviction while this court considered the exclusion of each group in a separate lawsuit? I believe the time has come to reject the dictum in Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 310, 25 L.Ed. 664, that a State 'may confine' jury service 'to males.' I would here reach the question we reserved in Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.S. 57, 60, 82 S.Ct. 159, 161, 7 L.Ed.2d 118, and hold that Art. 402, La.Code Crim.Proc.,1 as applied to exclude women as a class from Lafayette Parish jury rolls, violated petitioner Alexander's constitutional right to an impartial jury drawn from a group representative of a cross-section of the community.2\n\n\n16\nIt is irrelevant to our analysis that Alexander attacks the composition of the grand jury that indicted him, not the petit jury which convicted him, for it is clear that a State which has a grand jury procedure must administer that system consonantly with the Federal Constitution. The Court asserts, however, that 'federal concepts' of a grand jury do not obligate the States, and cites Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516, 538, 4 S.Ct. 111, 122, 28 L.Ed.2d 232. Ante, at 633. But Hurtado supports no such proposition. That case merely held that the Fifth Amendment grand jury requirement was not binding on the States. It said nothing as to the constitutional requirements which obtain once a State chooses to provide a grand jury, and we are directed to no other case which does speak to the subject. But this Court has said time and again, regardless of a State's freedom to reject the federal grand jury, and to reject even the petit jury for offenses punishable by less than six months' imprisonment, Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. 66, 90 S.Ct. 1886, 26 L.Ed.2d 437, 'Once the State chooses to provide grand and petit juries, whether or not constitutionally required to do so, it must hew to federal constitutional criteria . . .' Carter v. Jury Commission of Greene County, 396 U.S. 320, 330, 90 S.Ct. 518, 523, 24 L.Ed.2d 549.3\n\n\n17\nIt is furthermore clear that just such a 'federal constitutional criteri(on)' is that the grand jury, just as the petit jury must be drawn from a representative cross-section of the community. The Court was speaking of both grand and petit juries in Carter v. Jury Commission, supra, when, quoting Smith v. Texas, 311 U.S. 128, 130, 61 S.Ct. 164, 165, 85 L.Ed. 84, it defined the jury as 'a body truly representative of the community.' 396 U.S., at 330, 90 S.Ct., at 524. The Court was speaking of grand and petit juries when it said in Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 474, 73 S.Ct. 397, 416, 97 L.Ed. 469: 'Our duty to protect the federal constitutional rights of all does not mean we must or should impose on states our conception of the proper source of jury lists, so long as the source reasonably reflects a cross-section of the population suitable in character and intelligence for that civic duty.' (Emphasis supplied.) As Mr. Justice Black said, speaking for the Court in Pierre v. Louisiana, 306 U.S. 354, 358, 59 S.Ct. 536, 83 L.Ed. 757: 'Indictment by Grand Jury and trial by jury cease to harmonize with our traditional concepts of justice at the very moment particular groups, classes or races . . . are excluded as such from jury service.' (Footnote omitted.)\n\n\n18\nThe requirement that a jury reflect a cross-section of the community occurs throughout our jurisprudence: 'The American tradition of trial by jury, considered in connection with either criminal or civil proceedings, necessarily contemplates an impartial jury drawn from a cross-section of the community. Smith v. Texas, 311 U.S. 128, 130, 61 S.Ct. 164, 165, 85 L.Ed. 84; Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 85, 62 S.Ct. 457, 471, 86 L.Ed. 680.' Thiel v. Southern Pacific Co., 328 U.S. 217, 220, 66 S.Ct. 984, 985, 90 L.Ed. 1181. Accord, Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78, 100, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 1905, 26 L.Ed.2d 446; Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 520, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 20 L.Ed.2d 776; Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187, 192\u2014193, 67 S.Ct. 261, 263\u2014264, 91 L.Ed. 181; Labat v. Bennett, 5 Cir., 365 F.2d 698, 722\u2014724.4\n\n\n19\nThis is precisely the constitutional infirmity of the Louisiana statute. For a jury list from which women have been systematically excluded is not representative of the community.\n\n\n20\n'It is said, however, that an all male panel drawn from the      various groups within a community will be as truly      representative as if women were included. The thought is that      the factors which tend to influence the action of women are      the same as those which influence the action of men      personality, background, economic status\u2014and not sex.\n\n\n21\nYet it is not enough to say that women when sitting as jurors      neither act nor tend to act as a class. Men likewise do not      act as a class. But, if the shoe were on the other foot, who      would claim that a jury was truly representative of the community if all      men were intentionally and systematically excluded from the      panel? The truth is that the two sexes are not fungible; a      community made up excusively of one is different from a      community composed of both; the subtle interplay of influence      one on the other is among the imponderables. To insulate the      courtroom from either may not in a given case make an iota of      difference. Yet a flavor, a distinct quality is lost if      either sex is excluded. The exclusion of one may indeed make      the jury less representative of the community than would be      true if an economic or racial group were excluded.' Ballard      v. United States, supra, 329 U.S., at 193\u2014194, 67 S.Ct., at      264. (Emphasis supplied; footnotes omitted).\n\n\n22\nThe record before us, moreover, indisputably reveals that such a systematic exclusion operated with respect to the Lafayette Parish jury lists. There were no women on the grand jury that indicted petitioner, and there were no women on the venire from which the jury was chosen. While the venire was selected from returns to questionnaires sent to parish residents, not a single one of the some 11,000 questionnaires was even sent to a woman. This was done deliberately.5\n\n\n23\nThe State relies on the fact that the automatic exemption it grants to women is the same as the one upheld in Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.S. 57, 82 S.Ct. 159, 7 L.Ed.2d 118. In Hoyt, however, there were women on the jury rolls, and the jury commissioners had made good-faith efforts to include women on the jury lists despite the fact that they had an automatic exemption unless they volunteered for service. Id., 368 U.S., at 69, 82 S.Ct., at 166 (Warren, C.J., concurring opinion). Here, on the other hand, only the feeblest efforts were made to interest women in service,6 and there was testimony that only a single woman had filled out a jury service questionnaire.7 This, out of a parish population of 45,000 adults, 52% of whom were female.\n\n\n24\nThe absolute exemption provided by Louisiana, and no other State,8 betrays a view of a woman's role which cannot withstand scrutiny under modern standards. We once upheld the constitutionality of a state law denying to women the right to practice law, solely on grounds of sex. Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130, 21 L.Ed. 442. The rationale underlying Art. 402 of the Louisiana Code is the same as that which was articulated by Justice Bradley in Bradwell:\n\n\n25\n'Man is, or should be, woman's protector and defender. The      natural and proper timidity and delicacy which belongs to the      female sex evidently unfits it for many of the occupations of      civil life. The constitution of the family organization,      which is founded in the divine ordinance, as well as in the      nature of things, indicates the domestic sphere as that which      properly belongs to the domain and functions of womanhood.      The harmony, not to say identity, of interests and views      which belong, or should belong, to the family institution is      repugnant to the idea of a woman adopting a distinct and      independent career from that of her husband. . . .\n\n\n26\n'. . . The paramount destiny and mission of woman are to      fulfil the noble and benign offices of wife and mother. This      is the law of the Creator. And the rules of civil society      must be adapted to the general constitution of things, and      cannot be based upon exceptional cases.' Id., at 141\u2014142.\n\n\n27\nClassifications based on sex are no longer insulated from judicial scrutiny by a legislative judgment that 'woman's place is in the home,' or that woman is by her 'nature' ill-suited for a particular task. See, e.g., Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 92 S.Ct. 251, 30 L.Ed.2d 225. But such a judgment is precisely that which underpins the absolute exemption from jury service at issue.9 Insofar as Hoyt, supra, embodies this discredited stereotype, it should be firmly disapproved.10 See Johnston & Knapp, Sex Discrimination by Law: A Study in Judicial Perspective, 46 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 675, 708\u2014721 (1971).\n\n\n28\nLouisiana says, however, that women are not totally excluded from service; they may volunteer. The State asserts it is impractical to require women affirmatively to claim the statutory exemption because of the large numbers who would do so. This argument misses the point. Neither man nor woman can be expected to volunteer for jury service. Hoyt, supra, 368 U.S., at 64\u201465, 82 S.Ct., at 164. See L. Kanowitz, Women and the Law 30 (1969). Thus, the automatic exemption, coupled with the failure even to apprise parish women of their right to volunteer, results in as total an exclusion as would obtain if women were not permitted to serve at all.\n\n\n29\nSome violations of due process of law may be excused in the context of a criminal trial, if the error cannot be shown to have had an effect on the outcome. See, e.g., Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104; Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 272, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 1178, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217. But the right to a representative jury is one which would be trivialized were a similar requirement imposed:\n\n\n30\n'We can never measure accurately the prejudice that results      from the exclusion of certain types of qualified people from      a jury panel. Such prejudice is so subtle, so intangible,      that it escapes the ordinary methods of proof. It may be      absent in one case and present in another; it may gradually      and silently erode the jury system before it becomes evident.      But it is no less real or meaningful for our purposes. If the      constitutional right to a jury impartially drawn from a      cross-section of the community has been violated, we should      vindicate that right even though the effect of the violation has not      yet put in a tangible appearance. Otherwise that right may be      irretrievably lost in a welter of evidentiary rules.' Fay v.      New York, 332 U.S. 261, 300, 67 S.Ct. 1613, 1634, 91 L.Ed.      2043 (Murphy, J., dissenting).\n\n\n31\nA statutory procedure which has the effect of excluding all women does not produce a representative jury, and is therefore repugnant to our constitutional scheme. Cf. White v. Crook, 251 F.Supp. 401, 408\u2014409 (MD Ala.1966). For these reasons, I would hold Art. 402, La.Code Crim.Proc., to be unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n1\n 255 La. 941, 233 So.2d 891 (1970). Petitioner was indicted for aggravated rape, and a 12-member jury unanimously returned a verdict of 'Guilty without Capital Punishment.'\n\n\n2\n 401 U.S. 936, 91 S.Ct. 946, 28 L.Ed.2d 215 (1971).\n\n\n3\n Petitioner does not here challenge the composition of the petit jury that convicted him. The principles that apply to the systematic exclusion of potential jurors on the ground of race are essentially the same for grand juries and for petit juries, however. Pierre v. Louisiana, 306 U.S. 354, 358, 59 S.Ct. 536, 538 539, 83 L.Ed. 757 (1939). See generally Neal v. Delaware, 103 U.S. 370, 26 L.Ed. 567 (1881).\n\n\n4\n The general qualifications for jurors set by Louisiana law are that a person must be a citizen of the United States and of Louisiana who has resided in the parish for at least a year prior to jury service, be at least 21 years old, be able to read, write, and speak the English language, '(n)ot be under interdiction, or incapable of serving as a juror because of a mental or physical infirmity,' and '(n)ot be under indictment for a felony, nor have been convicted of a felony for which he has not been pardoned.' La.Code Crim.Proc., Art. 401 (1967).\n\n\n5\n Testimony at the hearing on the motion to quash the indictment also revealed that there were 40,896 registered voters in the parish. Of this total, 17,803 were white males, and 16,483 were white females; 3,573 were Negro males, and 3,037 were Negro females. App. 38.\n\n\n6\n One hundred and eighty-nine questionnaires had no racial designation. App. 15.\n\n\n7\n There are some inconsistencies in the record as to the total number of Negroes in this group. The State introduced a certification by the clerk of the court stating that there were 25 Negroes and four persons with no race shown. App. 15. A count of the actual list of jurors, however, shows 27 Negroes and five persons with no race shown. App. 16\u201424.\n\n\n8\n Section 4 of the 1875 Civil Rights Act, 18 Stat. 336, now codified as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 243, affirms and reinforces this constitutional right: 'No citizen possessing all other qualifications which are or may be prescribed by law shall be disqualified for service as grand or petit juror in any court of the United States, or of any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude; and whoever, being an officer or other person charged with any duty in the selection or summoning of jurors, excludes or fails to summon any citizen for such cause, shall be fined not more than $5,000.'\n\n\n9\n We take note, as we did in Whitus v. Georgia, 385 U.S. 545, 552 n. 2, 87 S.Ct. 643, 647, 17 L.Ed.2d 599 (1967), of petitioner's demonstration that under one statistical technique of calculating probability, the chances that 27 Negroes would have been selected at random for the 400-member final jury list, when 1,015 out of the 7,374 questionnaires returned were from Negroes, are one in 20,000. Brief for Petitioner, 18 n. 18.\n\n\n1\n Article 402, La.Code Crim.Proc.: 'A woman shall not be selected for jury service unless she has previously filed with the clerk of court of the parish in which she resides a written declaration of her desire to be subject to jury service.'\n\n\n2\n The fact that Alexander is a male challenging the exclusion of females from the jury rolls is not of significance, for his claim rests, not on equal protection principles, but on the right of any defendant to an impartial jury, no matter what his sex or race.\n\n\n3\n While Carter arose under the Equal Protection Clause, and concerned the right of prospective jurors excluded from the venire solely by reason of their race, the analysis is the same in the instant case, where the question is the accused's right to an impartial jury. Turner v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 466, 85 S.Ct. 546, 13 L.Ed.2d 424.\n\n\n4\n The cases most precisely articulating the requirement that a jury reflect a cross section of the community arose under our supervisory power over the federal courts. See, e.g., Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187, 67 S.Ct. 261, 91 L.Ed. 181; Thiel v. Southern Pacific Co., 328 U.S. 217, 66 S.Ct. 984, 90 L.Ed. 1181; Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680. The detail with which these cases were written, however, simply reflects our obligation to provide guidelines for the federal system. It is consistent with our principle of federalism that the States be permitted greater latitude in fashioning their jury-selection procedures, but to avoid constitutional infirmity the result must be designed to produce a representative cross section of the community. Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 474, 73 S.Ct. 397, 416, 97 L.Ed. 469; Carter v. Jury Commission, 396 U.S. 320, 322, 333, 90 S.Ct. 518, 519, 525, 24 L.Ed.2d 549.\n\n\n5\n Mr. LeBlanc, clerk of the court in Lafayette Parish, and a member of the parish jury commission, testified as to the process by which the venire was chosen at the hearing on the motion to quash Alexander's indictment:\n'A. The slips or list that are put in the general venire box are made from questionnaires that I mailed out.\n'Q. Now, who is this questionnaire sent to? How is that determined?\n'A. To the different people in the Parish by the registrar of voter's list and the telephone book, city directory, different lists that are submitted by school board or any list that we can find that we think we got address (sic) for the mixed race one way or the other.\n'Q. Was the questionnaire mailed to any women at all?\n'A. We have received some that was filed in by some ladies. I think one.\n'Q. Did you mail any to any women intentionally or did you intentionally exclude women when you mailed them?\n'A. We didn't mail any to the women.' App. 35, 53.\n\n\n6\n The only evidence in the record that any effort whatsoever was expended to encourage women to volunteer for jury service was a statement by Mr. LeBlanc that he had 'discussed that with the Assistant District Attorney,' and that he had 'sent her at (sic) different women's clubs to explain to the women the possibility of being on the jury.' App. 54. He also averred that 'we're working on the women to submit names and intention to serve.' Ibid.\n'As indicated in n. 5, supra, however, these efforts produced but a single questionnaire from a woman. The 11,000 questionnaires sent to men, on the other hand, resulted in over 7,000 responses. App. 15.\n\n\n7\n Testimony of Mr. LeBlanc. See nn. 5\u20146, supra.\n\n\n8\n No State now prohibits women from service on juries altogether, Alabama's prohibition having been found unconstitutional in White v. Crook, 251 F.Supp. 401 (MD Ala.1966). Most States afford equal treatment to men and women, although exemptions are frequently provided for women who are pregnant or who have children under 18 at home. Five States now allow women an absolute exemption, based solely on their sex, but they must affirmatively request it. Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 59\u2014124 (1965); Mo.Const., Art. I, \u00a7 22(b); N.Y. Judiciary Law \u00a7 507(7), McKinney's Consol.Laws, c. 30 (1968); R.I.Gen.Laws Ann. \u00a7 9\u20149\u201411 (1970); Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 22\u2014101, \u00a7 22\u2014108 (1955).\n\n\n9\n Perhaps the purest articulation of the objection to woman jury service is that of Judge Turner, dissenting in Rosencrantz v. Territory, 2 Wash.Ter. 267, 5 P. 305 (1884), a case in which a female defendant challenged the grand jury which indicted her on the ground that it included married women living with their husbands. The challenge was rejected over Judge Turner's dissent:\n'It is said that the rights of the weaker sex, if I may now call them so, are more regarded than in the days of Blackstone; and that the theory for that day, that women were unfitted by physical constitution and mental characteristics to assume and perform the civil and political duties and obligations of citizenship, has been exploded by the advanced ideas of the nineteenth century. This may be true. No man honors the sex more than I. None has witnessed more cheerfully the improvement in the laws of the States, and particularly in the laws of this Territory, whereby many of the disabilities of that day are removed from them, and their just personal and property rights put upon an equal footing with those of men. I cannot say, however, that I wish to see them perform the duties of jurors. The liability to perform jury duty is an obligation, not a right. In the case of woman, it is not necessary that she should accept the obligation to secure or maintain her rights. If it were, I should stifle all expression of the repugnance that I feel at seeing her introduced into associations and exposed to influences which, however others regard it, must, in my opinion, shock and blunt those fine sensibilities, the possession of which is her chiefest charm, and the protection of which, under the religion and laws of all countries, civilized or semi-civilized, is her most sacred right.\n'If one woman is competent as a juror, all women having the same qualifications are competent. If women may try one case, they may try all cases. It is unnecessary, to say more; to suggest the shocking possibilities to which our wives, mothers, sisters, and daughters may be exposed . . .. These observations, however, are not pertinent here. The question is, What is the law?\n'I say, that the laws now concerning the important incidents of a jury trial are, by express constitutional provision, what they were at the common law, and that under that law a jury was no jury unless it was composed of men.' Id., at 278\u2014279, 5 P., at 309 310.\n\n\n10\n In Fay v. New York, 332 U.S. 261, 67 S.Ct. 1613, 91 L.Ed. 2043, there is also a dictum approving the constitutionality of excluding women from jury service. Relying solely on the proposition that: 'Until recently, and for nearly a half-century after the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, it was universal practice in the United States to allow only men to sit on juries,' the Court opined that 'woman jury service has not so become a part of the textual or customary law of the land that one convicted of crime must be set free by this Court if his state has lagged behind what we personally may regard as the most desirable practice in recognizing the rights adn obligations of womanhood.' Id., at 289\u2014290, 67 S.Ct. at 1628\u20141629. This dictum was totally irrelevant to the holding in Fay approving New York's special 'blue-ribbon' jury system for the Court stated flatly that: 'The evidence does not show that women are excluded from the special jury.' Id., at 278, 67 S.Ct., at 1622. Indeed, there were women on the very jury which was at issue in the case. Ibid.\nThe 'nose-counting' approach which led to the Fay Court's refusal to recognize woman jury service as 'part of the textual or customary law of the land' has, of course, been thoroughly undermined by subsequent events. See n. 8, supra. It has been suggested that the decision itself was overruled by Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491. Id., at 185 n. 25, 88 S.Ct., at 1468, and text following (Harlan, J., dissenting). And what little there may be left after Duncan, is, like Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 25 L.Ed. 664, and Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.S. 57, 82 S.Ct. 159, 7 L.Ed.2d 118, based on an obsolete view of woman's role which does not square with reality. '(The Fay) dictum . . . calls to mind\u2014in its total reliance on historical practice as justification for sex discrimination\u2014the . . . observation . . . that attitudes can be more formidable than arguments.' Johnston & Knapp, Sex Discrimination by Law: A Study in Judicial Perspective, 46 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 675, 715 (1971). See State v. Emery, 224 N.C. 581, 601, 31 S.E.2d 858, 871 (1944) (Seawell, J., dissenting). See also Resencrantz v. Territory, supra (Turner, J., dissenting).\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"407 U.S. 203\n92 S.Ct. 1951\n32 L.Ed.2d 659\nIvan V.v.CITY OF NEW YORK.\nNo. 71\u20146425.\nDecided June 12, 1972.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nThe Court held in In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368, decided March 31, 1970, that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is among the essentials of due process and fair treatment that must be afforded at the adjudicatory stage when a juvenile is charged with an act that would constitute a crime if committed by an adult. In this case, on January 6, 1970, before Winship was decided, petitioner was adjudged a delinquent in the Family Court of Bronx County, New York, on a finding, based on the preponderance-of-evidence standard, that, at knifepoint, he forcibly took a bicycle from another boy, an act that, if done by an adult, would constitute the crime of robbery in the first degree. On direct appeal, the Appellate Division, First Department, reversed on the ground that Winship should be retroactively applied to all cases still in the appellate process, 35 A.D.2d 806, 316 N.Y.S.2d 568 (1970). The New York Court of Appeals reversed the Appellate Division, holding that Winship was not to be applied retroactively, V. v. City of New York, 29 N.Y.2d 583, 324 N.Y.S.2d 313, 272 N.E.2d 895 (1971).* On remand, the Appellate Division thereupon affirmed the delinquency adjudication, 37 A.D.2d 822, 324 N.Y.S.2d 934 (1971), and the Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal from that affirmance, 29 N.Y.2d 489, 328 N.Y.S.2d 1026, 278 N.E.2d 655 (1972). We disagree with the holding of the Court of Appeals that Winship is not to be applied retroactively.\n\n\n2\n'Where the major purpose of new constitutional doctrine is to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impairs its truth-finding function and so raises serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials, the new rule has been given complete retroactive effect. Neither good-faith reliance by state or federal authorities on prior constitutional law or accepted practice, nor severe impact on the administration of justice has sufficed to require prospective application in these circumstances.' Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, 653, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 1152, 28 L.Ed.2d 388 (1971). See Adams v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 278, 280, 92 S.Ct. 916, 918, 31 L.Ed.2d 202 (1972); Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 295, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 1922, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1968).\n\n\n3\nWinship expressly held that the reasonable-doubt standard 'is a prime instrument for reducing the risk of convictions resting on factual error. The standard provides concrete substance for the presumption of innocence\u2014that bedrock 'axiomatic and elementary' principle whose 'enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law' . . . 'Due process commands that no man shall lose his liberty unless the Government has borne the burden of . . . convincing the factfinder of his guilt.' To this end, the reasonable-doubt standard is indispensable, for it 'impresses on the trier of fact the necessity of reaching a subjective state of certitude of the facts in issue.\" 397 U.S., at 363\u2014364, 90 S.Ct., at 1072.\n\n\n4\nPlainly, then, the major purpose of the constitutional standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt announced in Winship was to overcome an aspect of a criminal trial that substantially impairs the truth-finding function, and Winship is thus to be given complete retroactive effect. The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for writ of certiorari are granted. The judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York, First Judicial Department, is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n5\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n6\nJudgment of the Appellate Division reversed and case remanded.\n\n\n7\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n\n*\n The Court of Appeals followed Matter of D., 27 N.Y.2d 90, 313 N.Y.S.2d 704, 261 N.E.2d 627 (1970), where Winship was said not to be retroactive but that even if it were, appellant there had waived the claim when he entered a guilty plea to the charges. In that circumstance this Court dismissed an appeal and denied certiorari in that case. D. v. County of Onandaga, 403 U.S. 926, 91 S.Ct. 2244, 29 L.Ed.2d 705 (1971).\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"343 U.S. 808\n72 S.Ct. 999\n96 L.Ed. 1317\nCASEY et al.v.UNITED STATES.\nNo. 379.\nSubmitted March 3, 1952.\nDecided June 9, 1952.\n\nMr. F. M. Reischling, Seattle, Wash., for petitioner.\nMessrs. Philip B. Perlman, Sol. Gen., Washington, D.C., James M. McInerney, Asst. Atty. Gen., James L. Morrison, Miss Beatrice Rosenberg, and Mr. Murry Lee Randall, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nThe controlling claim in this case is that there was an unreasonable search and seizure of evidence, the admission of which vitiated the convictions. Before determining these issues conflicting views as to the facts in this case and the inferences to be drawn from them would have to be resolved. The Solicitor General confesses error and asks that the judgment below should be reversed as to all the petitioners, leaving of course the way open for a new trial. To accept in this case his confession of error would not involve the establishment of any precedent.\n\n\n2\nAccordingly we reverse the judgment as to all the petitioners.\n\n\n3\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice REED join, dissenting.\n\n\n4\nI do not believe we should take our law from the Department of Justice or from any other litigant. The reasons why the Department of Justice confesses error in a case may be wholly honorable. For example, those in the Solicitor General's office may be honestly converted to the point of view which their colleagues opposed below. I assume that is true in the present case. But I also know that litigants usually have selfish purposes. What the motivation behind a particular confession of error may be will seldom be known. We cannot become a paty to it without serving the unknown cause of the litigant. The practice in cases in which the Solicitor General confesses error was settled by Young v. United States, 1942, 315 U.S. 257, 62 S.Ct. 510, 86 L.Ed. 832. When the Government confessed error on Young's petition for certiorari, the confession was not accepted but, instead, the petition was granted and the case set down for argument. 1941, 314 U.S. 595, 62 S.Ct. 59, 86 L.Ed. 480. In the unanimous opinion of the Court, two Justices not participating, the function of this Court upon the Government's confession of error was described with particularity:\n\n\n5\n'The public trust reposed in the law enforcement officers of      the Government requires that they be quick to confess error      when, in their opinion, a miscarriage of justice may result      from their remaining silent. But such a confession does not      relieve this Court of the performance of the judicial      function. The considered judgment of the law enforcement      officers that reversible error has been committed is entitled      to great weight, but our judicial obligations compel us to      examine independently the errors confessed. See Parlton v.      United States, 64 App.D.C. 169, 75 F.2d 772. The public      interest that a result be reached which promotes a      well-ordered society is foremost in every criminal      proceeding. That interest is entrusted to our consideration      and protection as well as that of the enforcing officers.      Furthermore, our judgments are precedents, and the proper administration of the      criminal law cannot be left merely to the stipulation of      parties. Cf. Rex v. Wilkes, 4 Burr. 2527, 2551, 98 Eng.Rep.      327; State v. Green, 167 Wash. 266, 9 P.2d 62.' 315 U.S. at      258\u2014259, 62 S.Ct. at page 511, 86 L.Ed. 832.\n\n\n6\nAs a result, the Court proceeded to examine the errors urged by petitioner and, upon consideration of the record, reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.1\n\n\n7\nThe principles announced in Young v. United States, supra, were expressly reaffirmed in Gibson v. United States, 1946, 329 U.S. 338, 344, 67 S.Ct. 301, 304, 91 L.Ed. 331, cf. Marino v. Ragen, 1947, 332 U.S. 561, 562, 68 S.Ct. 240, 241, 92 L.Ed. 170.2 Moreover, the practice of this Court in cases in which the Solicitor General confesses error has followed the Young rule. Unlike today's per curiam, our recent per curiam orders and opinions have been careful to note that our reversal of a court of appeals judgment is based upon consideration of the record, not blind acceptance of a confession of error.3\n\n\n8\nWe sit in this cse not to enforce the requests of the Department of Justice but to review the action of a lower court. Here the Court of Appeals ruled that petitioners had no standing to complain of the search. That ruling is questionable in view of the intervening decision of this Court in United States v. Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48, 72 S.Ct. 93. But the confession of error is not limited to that ruling. The Department of Justice now maintains that the District Court was in error in ruling in the government's favor on the issue of search and seizure.\n\n\n9\nThe facts are not in dispute. The only question is the reach of our decision in Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543. That decision states a principle of constitutional law. Until it is reversed or modified, it prescribes a rule for the courts to apply according to their best lights, not according to the desires of either the prosecution or the defense.\n\n\n10\nSince the Court of Appeals did not reach that issue when the case was before it, we should at the very least remand the case to it for consideration of that question. If we are to decide it, we should do so only after full exploration of the facts and the law. Whatever action we take is a precedent.\n\n\n11\nI cannot state too strongly my belief that if the courts are to retain their independence, they must decide cases taken on the merits. A confession of error by a litigant is, of course, an important factor to take into account in studying a record.4 It may disclose an intervening decision on a question of law that undermines the lower court's conclusion; it may disclose perjury by an important witness or newly discovered evidence; it may disclose other factors which weaken the conclusion of the lower court. Or it may disclose a maneuver to save one case at the expense of another.5 Once we accept a confession of error at face value and make it the controlling and decisive factor in our decision, we no longer administer a system of justice under a government of laws.\n\n\n\n1\n During the same term of Court as Young v. United States, supra, the Government also confessed error in Weber v. United States. The Court granted certiorari, 1941, 314 U.S. 600, 62 S.Ct. 125, 86 L.Ed. 483, heard argument, and affirmed the Court of Appeals judgment by an equally divided Court. 1942, 315 U.S. 787, 62 S.Ct. 911, 86 L.Ed. 1192.\n\n\n2\n In Upshaw v. United States, 1948, 335 U.S. 410, 69 S.Ct. 170, 93 L.Ed. 100, the Government had confessed error in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. That court, adhering to its precedent in Parlton v. United States, 1935, 64 App.D.C. 169, 75 F.2d 772, cited with approval in Young v. United States, supra, 315 U.S. at page 259, 62 S.Ct. at page 511, 86 L.Ed. 832, conducted an independent examination of the errors confessed. 1948, 83 U.S.App.D.C. 207, 168 F.2d 167. This Court reversed in a 5\u20144 decision without suggesting that the Court of Appeals had erred in considering the merits of the Government's position.\n\n\n3\n Cates v. Haderlein, 1951, 342 U.S. 804, 72 S.Ct. 47; Chiarella v. United States, 1951, 341 U.S. 946, 71 S.Ct. 1004, 95 L.Ed. 1370; Ryles v. United States, 1949, 336 U.S. 949, 69 S.Ct. 882, 93 L.Ed. 1104; Bellaskus v. Crossman, 1948, 335 U.S. 840, 69 S.Ct. 64, 93 L.Ed. 391; Fogel v. United States, 1948, 335 U.S. 865, 69 S.Ct. 136, 93 L.Ed. 411; Wixman v. United States, 1948, 335 U.S. 874, 69 S.Ct. 233, 93 L.Ed. 417; Mogall v. United States, 1948, 333 U.S. 424, 68 S.Ct. 487, 92 L.Ed. 783.\n\n\n4\n Similarly, the fact that the Solicitor General does not oppose the granting of a petition for certiorari is entitled to respect, see, e.g., Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 1950, 339 U.S. 33, 36, 70 S.Ct. 445, 447, 94 L.Ed. 616. But it has never followed that we should automatically grant certiorari because of the Government's consent to such action. E.g., Community Services, Inc. v. United States, 1952, 342 U.S. 932, 72 S.Ct. 375 (certiorari denied); Dollar v. United States, 1952, 342 U.S. 910, 72 S.Ct. 304 (certiorari denied).\n\n\n5\n The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a treason conviction, one ground of affirmance being that the methods of expatriation listed in the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1168, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 801, were exclusive. Kawakita v. United States, 1951, 190 F.2d 506, 511\u2014514. We granted certiorari, 342 U.S. 932, 72 S.Ct. 375, and affirmed the Court of Appeals without resolving the question. 343 U.S. 717, 72 S.Ct. 950. The Solicitor General urged in support of the conviction that the expatriation procedures of the Nationality Act were exclusive.\nIn the District of Columbia Circuit, a judgment denying a claim of citizenship was affirmed, one ground of affirmance being that methods of expatriation listed in the Nationality Act of 1940 were not exclusive. Mandoli v. Acheson, 1952, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 112, 193 F.2d 920, 922. In his memorandum in response to the Mandoli petition for certiorari, the Solicitor General, adhering to his position in Kawakita, asserted that this ground of the Court of Appeals decision in this case is 'clearly erroneous.'\n\n\n","label":0}

Gen., State of Ill., Chicago Ill., for petitioners as amici curiae.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nPetitioners, the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services and its Secretary, seek review of a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ordering them to make payments to various nursing homes. These payments represent the amount that Florida was found to have underpaid these nursing homes in the course of its Medicaid reimbursements from July 1, 1976, to October 18, 1977.  Because we conclude that the court below misapplied the prevailing standard for finding a waiver of the State's immunity under the Eleventh Amendment, we grant a writ of certiorari and reverse.\n\n\n2\n* In 1972, Congress amended the Medicaid Program to provide that every \"skilled nursing facility and intermediate care facility\" must be reimbursed by participating States on a \"cost related basis.\"  86 Stat. 1426, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(E).  This amendment was to take effect on July 1, 1976, ibid., and had the effect of altering some reimbursement arrangements based on \"flat rates\" established by the States.  Regulations implementing this change were not promulgated by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) until 1976.  As a result, the regulations provided that HEW would not enforce the new \"cost related\" reimbursement requirement until January 1, 1978.  45 CFR \u00a7 250.30(a)(3)(iv) (1976).1\n\n\n3\nIn March 1977, respondents, an association of Florida nursing homes and various individual nursing homes in southern Florida, brought suit in federal court against the Secretary of HEW and petitioners.  They argued that the delay in enforcement created by the implementing regulations was inconsistent with the statutory directive that cost-related reimbursements begin on July 1, 1976. In addition to prospective relief, they sought retroactive relief in the form of payments by the State of the difference between the reimbursement they had received since July 1, 1976, and the amounts they would have received under a cost-related system.  The United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida held the regulations invalid, relying on its previous decision in Golden Isles Convalescent Center, Inc. v. Califano, 442 F.Supp. 201 (1977), aff'd 616 F.2d 1355 (CA5), cert. denied sub nom. Taylor v. Golden Isles Con- valescent Center, Inc., 449 U.S. 872, 101 S.Ct. 562, 66 L.Ed.2d 466 (1980).  These two cases were consolidated for consideration of the availability of retroactive relief, and the District Court held that such relief was barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n\n4\nOn appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the ruling that the regulations were invalid, but reversed the District Court's determination that retroactive relief was barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  616 F.2d 1355 (1980).2  The court acknowledged that retroactive monetary relief against a State in federal court is forbidden by the Eleventh Amendment \"if not consented to by the state.\"  Id., at 1362.  It found the requisite consent, however, based on two acts of the State.  First, Florida law provides that the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services is a \"body corporate\" with the capacity to \"sue and be sued,\" Fla.Stat. \u00a7 402.34 (1979).  616 F.2d, at 1363.  In addition to this general waiver of sovereign immunity, the court found a specific waiver of the Eleventh Amendment's immunity from suit in federal court in an agreement under the Medicaid Program in which the Department agreed to \"recognize and abide by all State and Federal Laws, Regulations, and Guidelines applicable to participation in an administration of, the Title XIX Medicaid Program.\"  Ibid.  \"By contracting with appellants to be bound by all federal laws applicable to the Medicaid program, the state has expressly waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity and consented to suit in federal court regarding any action by providers alleging a breach of these laws.\"  Ibid.\n\nII\n\n5\nThe analysis in this case is controlled by our decision in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).  There we applied 150 the Eleventh Amendment to retroactive grants of welfare benefits and discussed the proper standard for a waiver of this immunity by a State.  On the latter issue we stated that \"we will find waiver only where stated 'by the most express language or by such overwhelming implications from the text as [will] leave no room for any other reasonable construction.' \"  Id., at 673, 94 S.Ct., at 1361, quoting Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co., 213 U.S. 151, 171, 29 S.Ct. 458, 464, 53 L.Ed. 742 (1909).  We added that the \"mere fact that a State participates in a program through which the Federal Government provides assistance for the operation by the State of a system of public aid is not sufficient to establish consent on the part of the State to be sued in the federal courts.\"  415 U.S., at 673, 94 S.Ct., at 1361.\n\n\n6\nThe holding below, finding a waiver in this case, cannot be reconciled with the principles set out in Edelman.  As the Court of Appeals recognized, the State's general waiver of sovereign immunity for the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services \"does not constitute a waiver by the state of its constitutional immunity under the Eleventh Amendment from suit in federal court.\" 616 F.2d, at 1363.  See Smith v. Reeves, 178 U.S. 436, 441, 20 S.Ct. 919, 921, 44 L.Ed. 1140 (1900).  And the fact that the Department agreed explicitly to obey federal law in administering the program can hardly be deemed an express waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity.  This agreement merely stated a customary condition for any participation in a federal program by the State, and Edelman already established that neither such participation in itself, nor a concomitant agreement to obey federal law, is sufficient to waive the protection of the Eleventh Amendment.3 415 U.S., at 673-674, 94 S.Ct., at 1360-1361.\n\n\n7\nWe therefore reverse the decision below.\n\n\n8\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n9\nJustice BRENNAN, dissenting.\n\n\n10\nI dissent and would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  This suit is brought by Florida citizens against Florida officials.  In that circumstance I am of the view, expressed in dissent in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 687, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1367, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), that Florida \"may not invoke the Eleventh Amendment, since that Amendment bars only federal court suits against States by citizens of other States.\" Justice MARSHALL dissents and would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, substantially for the reasons stated in his dissent in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 688, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1368, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).\n\n\n11\nJustice BLACKMUN also dissents and would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals substantially for the reasons stated in Justice MARSHALL'S dissent in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 688, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1368, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).\n\n\n12\nJustice STEVENS, concurring.\n\n\n13\nThe decision of the Court of Appeals is in square conflict with this Court's holding in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662.  Apparently recognizing this fact, respondents urge the Court to grant certiorari and hear argument on the question whether Edelman should be overruled.1  I find this question less easily answered than do my Brothers, all of whom were Members of the Court when Edelman was decided.  Each has voted today consistently with his vote in Edelman itself.\n\n\n14\nThe arguments in favor of overruling Edelman are appealing, particularly because I share the opinion of Justice BRENNAN, Justice MARSHALL, and Justice BLACKMUN that Edelman was incorrectly decided.2  I have previously reliedon rather slender grounds for distinguishing Edelman,3 when wiser judges might have forthrightly urged rejection of the precedent.4 And I joined the Court's decision to overrule Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492, insofar as it concerned the financial responsibility of municipal corporations.  See Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 714, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2048, 56 L.Ed.2d 611, (STEVENS, J., concurring in part).  Moreover, the reflections of some former Members of the Court on the doctrine of stare decisis suggest that they would not have hesitated to overrule a decision that stands as an impediment to providing an adequate remedy for citizens injured by their government.5 Nevertheless, I find greater force in the countervailing arguments.\n\n\n15\nFirst, I would note that Edelman did not announce a rule of law fundamentally at odds with our current understanding of the scope of constitutionally protected civil rights,6 nor did it rest upon a discredited interpretation of the relevant historical documents.7  Rather, the rule of the Edelman case is of only limited significance and has been a part of our law for only a few years.  Its limiting effect on the jurisdiction of federal courts is not so restrictive that Congress may not mitigate its impact by unambiguously conditioning state participation in federal programs on a waiver of the Eleventh Amendment defense. The Edelman rule represents an interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment that had previously been endorsed by some of our finest Circuit Judges;8  it therefore cannot be characterized as unreasonable or egregiously incorrect.9\n\n\n16\nOf even greater importance, however, is my concern about the potential damage to the legal system that may be caused by frequent or sudden reversals of direction that may appear to have been occasioned by nothing more significant than a change in the identity of this Court's personnel.10  Granting that a zigzag is sometimes the best course.11  I am firmly convinced that we have a profound obligation to give recently decided cases the strongest presumption of validity.  Thatpresumption is supported by much more than the desire to foster an appearance of certainty and impartiality in the administration of justice, or the interest in facilitating the labors of judges.12 The presumption is an essential thread in the mantle of protection that the law affords the individual.  Citizens must have confidence that the rules on which they rely in ordering their affairs\u2014particularly when they are prepared to take issue with those in power in doing so\u2014are rules of law and not merely the opinions of a small group of men who temporarily occupy high office.13  It is the unpopular or beleaguered individual\u2014not the man in power\u2014who has the greatest stake in the integrity of the law.14\n\n\n17\nFor me, the adverse consequences of adhering to an arguably erroneous precedent in this case are far less serious than the consequences of further unravelling the doctrine of stare decisis. I therefore join the Court's disposition.\n\n\n\n1\n In a commentary accompanying the new regulations, the Secretary noted that no States would be able to accumulate needed data in time to meet the statutory deadline of July 1, 1976.  For this reason, cost-related reimbursement was not required under the regulations until January 1, 1978, but the States were \"encouraged to meet each requirement of the regulations as soon as possible.\" 41 Fed.Reg. 27305 (1976).\n\n\n2\n The Golden Isles case and this case remained consolidated on appeal.  The decision below, however, produced two separate petitions for certiorari.  The first, Taylor v. Golden Isles Convalescent Center, Inc., cert. denied, 449 U.S. 872, 101 S.Ct. 562, 66 L.Ed.2d 466 (1980), involved jurisdictional and venue issues.  The present petition relates only to the availability of retroactive relief.\n\n\n3\n Petitioners argue that under Florida law a waiver of immunity can only be accomplished by a state statute.  See Fla.Const., Art. 10, \u00a7 13.  No such waiver is present here.\nIn addition, it is worth noting that in October 1976 Congress repealed a provision requiring States participating in Medicaid to waive their Eleventh Amendment immunity.  Pub.L. 94-552, 90 Stat. 2540.  This repeal was made retroactive to January 1, 1976.\n\n\n1\n Respondents initially argued that the Court of Appeals' decision was distinguishable from Edelman and that certiorari therefore should be denied.  However, after the Solicitor General, on behalf of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, recommended that the Court grant certiorari and summarily reverse the lower court's decision, respondents requested that the Court instead grant certiorari and consider overruling Edelman.  See Supplemental Brief for Respondent Nursing Homes 4-13.\n\n\n2\n In 1972, I sat as a member of a three-judge District Court that rejected essentially the same Eleventh Amendment argument that the Court accepted in Edelman.  See Mothers and Childrens Rights Organization v. Sterrett, No. 70 F. 138 (ND Ind., Apr. 14, 1972) summarily aff'd, 409 U.S. 809, 93 S.Ct. 68, 34 L.Ed.2d 70; cited in Edelman, 415 U.S., at 670, n.13, 94 S.Ct., at 1359, n.13. I am therefore quite certain that I would have joined Justice MARSHALL'S dissent if I had been a Member of the Court when Edelman was decided.\n\n\n3\n See Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 458-460, 96 S.Ct. 2666, 2672-2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 614 (STEVENS, J., concurring).\n\n\n4\n In his 1949 Cardozo lecture, Justice Douglas stated:\n\"The idea that any body of law, particularly public law, should appear to stay put and not be in flux is an interesting phenomenon that Frank has explored in Law and the Modern Mind.  He points out how it is\u2014in law and in other fields too\u2014that men continue to chant of the immutability of a rule in order to 'cover up the transformation, to deny the reality of change, to conceal the truth of adaptation behind a verbal disguise of fixity and universality.'  But the more blunt, open, and direct course is truer to democratic traditions.  It reflects the candor of Cardozo.  The principle of full disclosure has as much place in government as it does in the market place.  A judiciary that discloses what it is doing and why it does it will breed understanding.  And confidence based on understanding is more enduring than confidence based on awe.\"  W. Douglas, Stare Decisis 30-31 (1949) (footnote omitted).\n\n\n5\n See W. Douglas, supra;  A. Goldberg, Equal Justice:  The Warren Era of the Supreme Court 67-97 (1971).\n\n\n6\n Cf. Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 489-495, 74 S.Ct. 686, 688-692, 98 L.Ed.2d 873, overruling Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256.\n\n\n7\n Cf. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 71-73, 58 S.Ct. 817, 818-820, 82 L.Ed. 1188, overruling Swift v. Tyson 16 Pet. 1, 10 L.Ed. 865.\n\n\n8\n The opinion in Rothstein v. Wyman, 467 F.2d 226, 228 (CA2 1972), which adopted the interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment subsequently approved by this Court in Edelman, was written by Judge McGowan (sitting by designation) and was joined by Chief Judge Friendly and Judge Timbers.  See 415 U.S., at 664-665, 666, n. 11, 94 S.Ct., at 1356, 1357, n. 11.\n\n\n9\n The principal justifications for refusing to apply the doctrine of stare decisis in Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611;  see id., at 695-701, 98 S.Ct., at 2038-2041, are therefore not available in this case.\n\n\n10\n Scholars have suggested that the identity of the Court's personnel was a factor underlying the decision in National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833, 853-855, 96 S.Ct. 2465, 2475-2476, 49 L.Ed.2d 245, to overrule Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U.S. 183, 88 S.Ct. 2017, 20 L.Ed.2d 1020.  See, e. g., J. Nowak, J. Young & R. Rotunda, Constitutional Law 159-163 (1978).\n\n\n11\n See, e. g., West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628, overruling Minersville School District v. Gobitis, 310 U.S. 586, 60 S.Ct. 1010, 84 L.Ed. 1375.\n\n\n12\n These concerns are not, however, insubstantial:\n\"[T]he labor of judges would be increased almost to the breaking point if every past decision could be reopened in every case, and one could not lay one's own course of bricks on the secure foundation of the courses laid by others who had gone before him.\"  B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 149 (1921).\n\n\n13\n This, of course, is not a novel suggestion.  As the first Justice White noted in his dissent in Pollack v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 157 U.S. 429, 652, 15 S.Ct. 673, 716, 39 L.Ed. 759:\n\"The fundamental conception of a judicial body is that of one hedged about by precedents which are binding on the court without regard to the personality of its members.  Break down this belief in judicial continuity, and let it be felt that on great constitutional questions this court is to depart from the settled conclusions of its predecessors, and to determine them all according to the mere opinion of those who temporarily fill its bench, and our Constitution will, in my judgment, be bereft of value and become a most dangerous instrument to the rights and liberties of the people.\"\n\n\n14\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE recently reminded us of this fact by quoting a statement ascribed to Sir Thomas More:\n\"This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coast Man's laws, not God's-and if you cut them down . . . d'you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? . . .  Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake.\"  See TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 195, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 2302, 57 L.Ed.2d 117, quoting R. Bolt, A Man for All Seasons, Act I, p. 147 (Three Plays, Heinemann ed. 1967).\n\n\n","label":1}

George Blow and George Rublee II, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nMr. Leonard B. Sand, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nOpinion of the Court by Mr. Justice BLACK announced by Mr. Justice DOUGLAS.\n\n\n1\nThis case presents a serious question concerning the meaning and application of that provision of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution which declares that no person shall\n\n\n2\n'* * * be subject for the same offence to be twice put in      jeopardy of life or limb * * *.'\n\n\n3\nThe petitioner, Everett Green, was indicted by a District of Columbia grand jury in two counts. The first charged that he had committed arson by maliciously setting fire to a house.1 The second accused him of causing the death of a woman by this alleged arson which if true amounted to murder in the first degree punishable by death.2 Green entered a plea of not guilty to both counts and the case was tried by a jury. After each side had presented its evidence the trial judge instructed the jury that it could find Green guilty of arson under the first count and of either (1) first degree murder or (2) second degree murder under the second count. The trial judge treated second degree murder, which is defined by the District Code as the killing of another with malice aforethought and is punishable by imprisonment for a term of years or for life,3 as an offense included within the language charging first degree murder in the second count of the indictment.\n\n\n4\nThe jury found Green guilty of arson and of second degree murder but did not find him guilty on the charge of murder in the first degree. Its verdict was silent on that charge. The trial judge accepted the verdict, entered the proper judgments and dismissed the jury. Green was sentenced to one to three years' imprisonment for arson and five to twenty years' imprisonment for murder in the second degree. He appealed the conviction of second degree murder. The Court of Appeals reversed that conviction because it was not supported by evidence and remanded the case for a new trial. 95 U.S.App.D.C. 45, 218 F.2d 856.\n\n\n5\nOn remand Green was tried again for first degree murder under the original indictment. At the outset of this second trial he raised the defense of former jeopardy but the court overruled his plea. This time a new jury found him guilty of first degree murder and he was given the mandatory death sentence. Again he appealed. Sitting en banc, the Court of Appeals rejected his defense of former jeopardy, relying on Trono v. United States, 199 U.S. 521, 26 S.Ct. 121, 50 L.Ed. 292, and affirmed the conviction. 98 U.S.App.D.C. 413, 236 F.2d 708. One judge concurred in the result, and three judges dissented expressing the view that Green had twice been placed in jeopardy in violation of the Constitution. We granted certiorari, 352 U.S. 915, 77 S.Ct. 217, 1 L.Ed.2d 122. Although Green raises a number of other contentions here we find it necessary to consider only his claim of former jeopardy.\n\n\n6\nThe sonstitutional prohibition against 'double jeopardy' was designed to protect an individual from being subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for an alleged offense. In his Commentaries, which greatly influenced the generation that adopted the Constitution, Blackstone recorded:\n\n\n7\n'* * * the plea of auterfoits acquit, or a former acquittal,      is grounded on this universal maxim of the common law of      England, that no man is to be brought into jeopardy of his      life more than once for the same offence.'4\n\n\n8\nSubstantially the same view was taken by this Court in Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, at page 169, 21 L.Ed. 872:\n\n\n9\n'The common law not only prohibited a second punishment for      the same offence, but it went further and forbid a second      trial for the same offence, whether the accused had suffered      punishment or not, and whether in the former trial he had      been acquitted or convicted.'5\n\n\n10\nThe underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\n\n\n11\nIn accordance with this philosophy it has long been settled under the Fifth Amendment that a verdict of acquittal is final, ending a defendant's jeopardy, and even when 'not followed by any judgment, is a bar to a subsequent prosecution for the same offence.' United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662, 671, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 1195, 41 L.Ed. 300. Thus it is one of the elemental principles of our criminal law that the Government cannot secure a new trial by means of an appeal even though an acquittal may appear to be erroneous. United States v. Ball, supra; Peters v. Hobby, 349 U.S. 331, 344\u2014345, 75 S.Ct. 790, 796, 99 L.Ed. 1129. Cf. Kepner v. United States, 195 U.S. 100, 24 S.Ct. 797, 49 L.Ed. 114; United States v. Sanges, 144 U.S. 310, 12 S.Ct. 609, 36 L.Ed. 445.\n\n\n12\nMoreover it is not even essential that a verdict of guilt or innocence be returned for a defendant to have once been placed in jeopardy so as to bar a second trial on the same charge. This Court, as well as most others, has taken the position that a defendant is placed in jeopardy once he is put to trial before a jury so that if the jury is discharged without his consent he cannot be tried again. Wade v. Hunter, 336 U.S. 684, 69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974; Kepner v. United States, 195 U.S. 100, 128, 24 S.Ct. 797, 804, 49 L.Ed. 114. In general see American Law Institute, Administration of The Criminal Law: Double Jeopardy 61\u201472 (1935). This prevents a prosecutor or judge from subjecting a defendant to a second prosecution by discontinuing the trial when it appears that the jury might not convict. At the same time jeopardy is not regarded as having come to an end so as to bar a second trial in those cases where 'unforeseeable circumstances * * * arise during (the first) trial making its completion impossible, such as the failure of a jury to agree on a verdict.' Wade v. Hunter, 336 U.S. 684, 688\u2014689, 69 S.Ct. 834, 837, 93 L.Ed. 974.\n\n\n13\nAt common law a convicted person could not obtain a new trial by appeal except in certain narrow instances.6 As this harsh rule was discarded courts and legislatures provided that if a defendant obtained the reversal of a conviction by his own appeal he could be tried again for the same offense.7 Most courts regarded the new trial as a second jeopardy but justified this on the ground that the appellant had 'waived' his plea of former jeopardy by asking that the conviction be set aside.8 Other courts viewed the second trial as continuing the same jeopardy which had attached at the first trial by reasoning that jeopardy did not come to an end until the accused was acquitted or his conviction became final.9 But whatever the rationalization, this Court has also held that a defendant can be tried a second time for an offense when his prior conviction for that same offense had been set aside on appeal. United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 41 L.Ed. 300.\n\n\n14\nIn this case, however, we have a much different question. At Green's first trial the jury was authorized to find him guilty of either first degree murder (killing while perpetrating a felony) or, alternatively, of second degree murder (killing with malice aforethought).10 The jury found him guilty of second degree murder, but on his appeal that conviction was reversed and the case remanded for a new trial. At this new trial Green was tried again, not for second degree murder, but for first degree murder, even though the original jury had refused to find him guilty on that charge and it was in no way involved in his appeal.11 For the reasons stated hereafter, we conclude that this second trial for first degree murder placed Green in jeopardy twice for the same offense in violation of the Constitution.12\n\n\n15\nGreen was in direct peril of being convicted and punished for first degree murder at his first trial. He was forced to run the gantlet once on that charge and the jury refused to convict him. When given the choice between finding him guilty of either first or second degree murder it chose the latter. In this situation the great majority of cases in this country have regarded the jury's verdict as an implicit acquittal on the charge of first degree murder.13 But the result in this case need not rest alone on the assumption, which we believe legitimate, that the jury for one reason or another acquitted Green of murder in the first degree. For here, the jury was dismissed without returning any express verdict on that charge and without Green's consent. Yet it was given a full opportunity to return a verdict and no extraordinary circumstances appeared which prevented it from doing so. Therefore it seems clear, under established principles of former jeopardy, that Green's jeopardy for first degree murder came to an end when the jury was discharged so that he could not be retried for that offense. Wade v. Hunter, 336 U.S. 684, 69 S.Ct. 834, 93 L.Ed. 974. In brief, we believe this case can be treated no differently, for purposes of former jeopardy, than if the jury had returned a verdict which expressly read: 'We find the defendant not guilty of murder in the first degree but guilty of murder in the second degree.'\n\n\n16\nAfter the original trial, but prior to his appeal, it is indisputable that Green could not have been tried again for first degree murder for the death resulting from the fire. A plea of former jeopardy would have absolutely barred a new prosecution even though it might have been convincingly demonstrated that the jury erred in failing to convict him of that offense. And even after appealing the conviction of second degree murder he still could not have been tried a second time for first degree murder had his appeal been unsuccessful.\n\n\n17\nNevertheless the Government contends that Green 'waived' his constitutional defense of former jeopardy to a second prosecution on the first degree murder charge by making a successful appeal of his improper conviction of second degree murder. We cannot accept this paradoxical contention. 'Waiver' is a vague term used for a great variety of purposes, good and bad, in the law. In any normal sense, however, it connotes some kind of voluntary knowing relinquishment of a right. Cf. Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461. When a man has been convicted of second degree murder and given a long term of imprisonment it is wholly fictional to say that he 'chooses' to forego his constitutional defense of former jeopardy on a charge of murder in the first degree in order to secure a reversal of an erroneous conviction of the lesser offense. In short, he has no meaningful choice. And as Mr. Justice Holmes observed, with regard to this same matter in Kepner v. United States, 195 U.S. 100, at page 135, 24 S.Ct. 797, at page 897, 49 L.Ed. 114: 'Usually no such waiver is expressed or thought of. Moreover, it cannot be imagined that the law would deny to a prisoner the correction of a fatal error unless he should waive other rights so important as to be saved by an express clause in the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n\n18\nIt is true that in Kepner, a case arising in the Philippine Islands under a statutory prohibition against double jeopardy, Mr. Justice Holmes dissented from the Court's holding that the Government could not appeal an acquittal in a criminal prosecution. He argued that there was only one continuing jeopardy until the 'case' had finally been settled, appeal and all, without regard to how many times the defendant was tried, but that view was rejected by the Court. The position taken by the majority in Kepner is completely in accord with the deeply entrenched principle of our criminal law that once a person has been acquitted of an offense he cannot be prosecuted again on the same charge. This Court has uniformly adhered to that basic premise. For example, in United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662, 671, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 1195, 41 L.Ed. 300, a unanimous Court held:\n\n\n19\n'The verdict of acquittal was final, and could not be      reviewed, on error or otherwise, without putting (the      defendant) twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the      constitution.'\n\n\n20\nAnd see Peters v. Hobby, 349 U.S. 331, 344\u2014345, 75 S.Ct. 790, 796\u2014797, 99 L.Ed. 1129; United States v. Sanges, 144 U.S. 310, 12 S.Ct. 609, 36 L.Ed. 445.\n\n\n21\nUsing reasoning which purports to be analogous to that expressed by Mr. Justice Holmes in Kepner, the Government alternatively argues that Green, by appealing, prolonged his original jeopardy so that when his conviction for second degree murder was reversed and the case remanded he could be tried again for first degree murder without placing him in new jeopardy. We believe this argument is also untenable. Whatever may be said for the notion of continuing jeopardy with regard to an offense when a defendant has been convicted of that offense and has secured reversal of the conviction by appeal, here Green was not convicted of first degree murder and that offense was not involved in his appeal. If Green had only appealed his conviction of arson and that conviction had been set aside surely no one would claim that he could have been tried a second time for first degree murder by reasoning that his initial jeopardy on that charge continued until every offense alleged in the indictment had been finally adjudicated.\n\n\n22\nReduced to plain terms, the Government contends that in order to secure the reversal of an erroneous conviction of one offense, a defendant must surrender his valid defense of former jeopardy not only on that offense but also on a different offense for which he was not convicted and which was not involved in his appeal. Or stated in the terms of this case, he must be willing to barter his constitutional protection against a second prosecution for an offense punishable by death as the price of a successful appeal from an erroneous conviction of another offense for which he has been sentenced to five to twenty years' imprisonment. As the Court of Appeals said in its first opinion in this case, a defendant faced with such a 'choice' takes a 'desperate chance' in securing the reversal of the erroneous conviction. The law should not, and in our judgment does not, place the defendant in such an incredible dilemma. Conditioning an appeal of one offense on a coerced surrender of a valid plea of former jeopardy on another offense exacts a forfeiture in plain conflict with the constitutional bar against double jeopardy.14\n\n\n23\nThe Government argues, however, that we should accept Trono v. United States, 199 U.S. 521, 26 S.Ct. 121, 50 L.Ed. 292, as a conclusive precedent against Green's claim of former jeopardy.15 The Trono case arose in the Philippine Islands, shortly after they had been annexed by the United States, under a statutory prohibition against double jeopardy. At that time a sharphy divided Court took the view that not all constitutional guarantees were 'applicable' in the insular possessions, particularly where the imposition of these guarantees would disrupt established customs. Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244, 21 S.Ct. 770, 45 L.Ed. 1088. In Trono the defendants had been charged with murder but were acquitted by the trial court which instead found them guilty of the lesser offense of assault. They appealed the assault conviction to the Philippine Supreme Court. That court, acting under peculiar local procedures modeled on pre-existing Spanish practices, which allowed it to review the facts and law and to substitute its findings for those of the trial judge, set aside their acquittal, found them guilty of murder and increased their sentences.\n\n\n24\nOn review by this Court, Mr. Justice Peckham, writing for himself and three other Justices, took the position that by appealing the conviction for assault the defendants waived their plea of former jeopardy with regard to the charge of murder. He said:\n\n\n25\n'We do not agree to the view that the accused has the right      to limit his waiver as to jeopardy, when he appeals from a      judgment against him. As the judgment stands before he      appeals, it is a complete bar to any further prosecution for      the offense set forth in the indictment. * * * No power can      wrest from him the right to so use that judgment, but if he      chooses to appeal from it * * * he thereby waives, if      successful, his right to avail himself of the former      acquittal of the greater offense * * *.' 199 U.S. at page      533, 26 S.Ct. at page 124.\n\n\n26\nMr. Justice Holmes refused to join the Peckham opinion but concurred in the result. Just the year before, in Kepner v. United States, 195 U.S. 100, 135, 24 S.Ct. 797, 807, 49 L.Ed. 114, he had sharply denounced the notion of 'waiver' as indefensible. There is nothing which indicates that his views had changed in the meantime. As pointed out above, he did dissent from the holding in Kepner\u2014that the Government could not appeal an acquittal\u2014on the ground that a new trial after an appeal by the Government was part of a continuing jeopardy rather than a second jeopardy. But that contention has been consistently rejected by this Court.\n\n\n27\nChief justice Fuller and Justices Harlan, White, and McKenna dissented in Trono. Mr. Justice McKenna wrote a dissent which was concurred in by Justices White and Harlan. During the course of this opinion he stated:\n\n\n28\n'It is, in effect, held that because the defendants * * *      appealed and sought a review, as authorized by the statute,      of the minor offense for which they were convicted, the      United States was given the right to try them for the greater      offense for which they were acquitted. * * * I think that the      guaranties of constitutions and laws should not be so      construed. * * * I submit that the state seeks no convictions      except in legal ways, and because it does not it affords      means of review of erroneous rulings and judgments, and      freely affords such means. It does not clog them with      conditions or forfeit by their exercise great and      constitutional rights. * * *\n\n\n29\n'* * * Here and there may be found a decision which supports      the exposition of once in jeopardy expressed in the (Peckham)      opinion. Opposed to it is the general concensus of opinion of      American text books on criminal law and the overwhelming      weight of American decided cases.' 199 U.S. at pages 538\u2014539,      540, 26 S.Ct. at page 125.\n\n\n30\nWe do not believe that Trono should be extended beyond its peculiar factual setting to control the present case. All that was before the Court in Trono was a statutory provision against double jeopardy pertaining to the Philippine Islands\u2014a territory just recently conquered with long-established legal procedures that were alien to the common law.16 Even then it seems apparent that a majority of the Court was unable to agree on any common ground for the conclusion that an appeal of a lesser offense destroyed a defense of former jeopardy on a greater offense for which the defendant had already been acquitted. As a matter of fact, it appears that each of the rationalizations advanced to justify this result was rejected by a majority of the Court. As Mr. Justice Holmes, who concurred in the result, effectively demonstrated, the 'waiver theory' is totally unsound and indefensible. On the other hand Mr. Justice Holmes' theory of continuing jeopardy has never outwardly been adhered to by any other Justice of this Court.17\n\n\n31\nWe believe that if either of the rationales offered to support the Trono result were adopted here it would unduly impair the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. The right not to be placed in jeopardy more than once for the same offense is a vital safeguard in our society, one that was dearly won and one that should continue to be highly valued. If such great constitutional protections are given a narrow, grudging application they are deprived of much of their significance. We do not feel that Trono or any other decision by this Court compels us to forego the conclusion that the second trial of Green for first degree murder was contrary to both the letter and spirit of the Fifth Amendment.\n\n\n32\nReversed.\n\n\n33\nMr. Justice FRANKFURTER, whom Mr. Justice BURTON, Mr. Justice CLARK and Mr. Justice HARLAN join, dissenting.\n\n\n34\nOn the basis of the following facts the Court has concluded that petitioner has twice been put in jeopardy of life in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.1\n\n\n35\nPetitioner was tried under an indictment on two counts. The first count charged arson under D.C.Code, 1951, \u00a7 22\u2014401. The second count charged murder in the first degree under D.C.Code, 1951, \u00a7 22\u20142401, in that in perpetrating the arson petitioner had caused the death of one Bettie Brown. In submitting the case to the jury under the second count, the trial court instructed on both first and second degree murder. The jury returned a verdict finding petitioner guilty of arson under the first count and of second degree murder under the second count; the verdict was silent on the charge of first degree murder. The court entered judgment on the verdict, and sentenced petitioner to terms of imprisonment of one to three years on the first count of the indictment and five to twenty years on the second count.\n\n\n36\nPetitioner appealed his conviction of second degree murder, contending that there was no evidence to suport a verdict for that offense. The Court of Appeals sustained this claim. It reversed the conviction and ordered a new trial on the ground that, since there was no basis in the evidence for finding petitioner guilty of murder in the second degree, it was error to instruct the jury on that issue. 95 U.S.App.D.C. 45, 218 F.2d 856.2 Petitioner was retried on the second count of the indictment, convicted of first degree murder, and sentenced to death. The Court of Appeals, the nine judges sitting en banc, affirmed this conviction, rejecting petitioner's contention that he had been put twice in jeopardy of his life in violation of the Federal Constitution, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 413, 236 F.2d 708, Chief Judge Edgerton and Judges Bazelon and Fahy dissenting.\n\n\n37\nSince the prohibition in the Constitution against double jeopardy is derived from history, its significance and scope must be determined, 'not simply by taking the words and a dictionary, but by considering (its) origin and the line of (its) growth.' Gompers v. United States, 233 U.S. 604, 610, 34 S.Ct. 693, 695, 58 L.Ed. 1115.\n\n\n38\nThe origin of this constitutional protection is found in the common-law pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict. In Vaux's Case, 4 Co.Rep. 44a, 45a, it was accepted as established that 'the life of a man shall not be twice put in jeopardy for one and the same offence, and that is the reason and cause that auterfoits acquitted or convicted of the same offence is a good plea * * *.' Likewise Blackstone stated that 'the plea of auterfoits acquit, or a former acquittal, is grounded on this universal maxim of the common law of England, that no man is to be brought into jeopardy of his life, more than once, for the same offense. And hence it is allowed as a consequence, that when a man is once fairly found not guilty upon any indictment, or other prosecution, before any court having competent jurisdiction of the offence, he may plead such acquittal in bar of any subsequent accusation for the same crime.' 4 Bl.Comm. 335. To try again one who had been previously convicted or acquitted of the same offense was 'abhorrent to the law of England.' Regina v. Tancock, 13 Cox C.C. 217, 220; see The King v. Emden, 9 East 437, 445\u2014447.\n\n\n39\nA principle so deeply rooted in the law of England, as an indispensable requirement of a civilized criminal procedure, was inevitably part of the legal tradition of the English Colonists in America. The Massachusetts Body of Liberties of 1641, an early compilation of principles drawn from the statutes and common law of England, declared that, 'No man shall be twise sentenced by Civill Justice for one and the same Crime, offence, or Trespasse,' and that 'Everie Action betweene partie and partie, and proceedings against delinquents in Criminal causes shall be briefly and destinctly entered on the Rolles of every Court by the Recorder thereof. That such actions be not afterwards brought againe to the vexation of any man.' Colonial Laws of Massachusetts 43, 47.\n\n\n40\nThus the First Congress, which proposed the Bill of Rights, came to its task with a tradition against double jeopardy founded both on ancient precedents in the English law and on legislation that had grown out of colonial experience and necessities. The need for the principle's general protection was undisputed, though its scope was not clearly defined. Fear of the power of the newly established Federal Government required 'an explicit avowal in (the Constitution) * * * of some of the plainest and best established principles in relation to the rights of the citizens, and the rules of the common law.' People v. Goodwin, 18 Johns., N.Y., 187, 202. Although many States in ratifying the Constitution had proposed amendments considered indispensable to secure the rights of the citizen against the Federal Government, New York alone proposed a prohibition against double jeopardy. This is not surprising in view of the fact that only in New Hampshire had the common-law principle been embodied in a constitutional provision. 2 Poore, Federal and State Constitutions, Colonial Charters and other Organic Laws (2d ed.), 1282. The bill of rights adopted by the New York convention, and transmitted to Congress with its ratification of the Constitution, included a declaration that, 'no Person ought to be put twice in Jeopardy of Life or Limb for one and the same Offence, nor, unless in case of impeachment, be punished more than once for the same Offence.' Documents Illustrative of the Formation of the Union, H.R.Doc. No. 398, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. 1035. This declaration was doubtless before Madison when he drafted the constitutional amendments to be proposed to the States.\n\n\n41\nThe terms in which Madison introduced into the House what became the specific provision that is our present concern were these: 'No person shall be subject, except in cases of impeachment, to more than one punishment or one trial for the same offence * * *.' 1 Annals of Cong. 434. Debate on this provision in the Committee of the Whole evidenced a concern that the language should express what the members understood to be the established common-law principle. There was fear that as proposed by Madison, it might be taken to prohibit a second trial even when sought by a defendant who had been convicted. Representative Benson of New York objected to the provision because he presumed it was meant to express the established principle 'that no man's life should be more than once put in jeopardy for the same offence; yet it was well known, that they were entitled to more than one trial.' 1 Annals of Cong. 753. Others who spoke agreed that although of course there could be no second trial following an acquittal, the prohibition should not extend to a second trial when a conviction had been set aside. The provision as amended by the Senate, S.J., 1st Cong., 1st Sess. 77, and eventually ratified as part of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, was substantially in the language used by Representative Benson to express his understanding of the common law.\n\n\n42\nThe question that had concerned the House in debating Madison's proposal, the relation between the prohibition against double jeopardy and the power to order a new trial following conviction, was considered at length by Mr. Justice Story on circuit in United States v. Gibert, 1834, 25 Fed.Cas. pages 1287, 1294\u20141303, No. 15,204. The defendants in that case had been found guilty of robbery on the high seas, a capital offense, and moved for a new trial. Mr. Justice Story, after full consideration of the English and American authorities, concluded that the court had no power to grant a new trial when the first trial had been duly had on a valid indictment before a court of competent jurisdiction. According to his view, the prohibition against double jeopardy applied equally whether the defendant had been acquitted or convicted, and there was no exception for a case where the new trial was sought by the defendant for his own benefit. Earlier, Mr. Justice Story had himself taken a non-literal view of the constitutional provision in United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 6 L.Ed. 165, where, writing for the Court, he found that discharge of a jury that had failed to agree was no bar to a second trial. See also 3 Story, Commentaries on The Constitution (1833), 659\u2014660.\n\n\n43\nStory's conclusion that English law prohibited, except in rate instances, granting a new trial after conviction of a felony was undoubtedly correct, see The King v. Mawbey, 6 T.R. 619, 638, and on occasion this result has been expressly made to depend on the maxim prohibiting double jeopardy. The Queen v. Murphy, 2 L.R.P.C. 535, 547\u2014548; see The Attorney-General v. Bertrand, 1 L.R.P.C. 520, 531\u2014534; but see The Queen v. Scaife, 17 Q.B. 238. To this day the Court of Criminal Appeals has ordinarily no power to order a new trial even after quashing a conviction on appeal by the defendant, Criminal Appeal Act, 7 Edw. VII, c. 23, s. 4(2), and repeated efforts to secure this power for the Court have met with the argument that a new trial would, at least in spirit, offend the principle that a defendant may not be put twice in jeopardy for the same offense. See 176 H.L.Deb. (5th ser. 1952) 759\u2014763.\n\n\n44\nThe old practice of the English courts, and the position taken by Mr. Justice Story, however, was generally rejected in the United States. The power to grant a new trial in the most serious cases appears to have been exercised by many American courts from an early date in spite of provisions against double jeopardy. United States v. Fries, 3 Dall. 515, 1 L.Ed. 701 (treason); see People v. Morrison, 1 Parker Cr.R., N.Y., 625, 626\u2014643 (rape). In United States v. Keen, 26 Fed.Cas. pages 686, 687\u2014670, No. 15,510, a decision rendered only five years after United States v. Gibert, Mr. Justice McLean, on circuit, vigorously rejected the view that the constitutional provision prohibited a new trial on the defendant's motion after a conviction, or that it 'guarantees to him the right of being hung, to protect him from the danger of a second trial.' See 26 Fed.Cas. at page 690. Other federal courts that had occasion to consider the question also rejected Mr. Justice Story's position, see United States v. Williams, 28 Fed.Cas. pages 636, 641, No. 16,707; United States v. Harding, 26 Fed.Cas. pages 131, 136\u2014138, No. 15,301, and statements by Court cast serious doubt on its validity. See Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 173\u2014174, 21 L.Ed. 872, and Mr. Justice Clifford dissenting at pages 201\u2014204. In Hopt v. Utah, 104 U.S. 631, 26 L.Ed. 873; 110 U.S. 574, 4 S.Ct. 202, 28 L.Ed. 262; 114 U.S. 488, 5 S.Ct. 972, 29 L.Ed. 183; 120 U.S. 430, 7 S.Ct. 614, 30 L.Ed. 708, the defendant was in fact retried three times following reversals of his convictions.\n\n\n45\nFinally, United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662\u2014671, 16 S.Ct. 1192\u20141195, 41 L.Ed. 300, expressly rejected the view that the double jeopardy provision prevented a second trial when a conviction had been set aside. Two of the defendants in the case had been convicted of murder, and on writ of error the judgments were reversed with directions to quash the indictment. The same defendants were then convicted on a new indictment. In affirming these convictions the Court said, 'it is quite clear that a defendant, who procures a judgment against him upon an indictment to be set aside may be tried anew upon the same indictment, or upon another indictment, for the same offence of which he had been convicted.' 163 U.S. at page 672, 16 S.Ct. at page 1195. On a literal reading of the constitutional provision, with an eye exclusively to the interests of the defendants, they had been 'once in jeopardy,' and were entitled to the benefit of a reversal of their convictions without the hazard of a new trial. The Court recognized, however, that such a wooden interpretation would distort the purposes of the constitutional provision to the prejudice of society's ligitimate interest in convicting the guilty as much as, in United States v. Gibert, they had been distorted to the prejudice of the defendants. See also Murphy v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 177 U.S. 155, 158\u2014160, 20 S.Ct. 639, 640\u2014641, 44 L.Ed. 711.\n\n\n46\nThe precise question now here first came before a federal court in United States v. Harding, 26 Fed.Cas. page 131, No. 15,301. There three defendants had been jointly indicted and tried for murder. One was convicted of murder and two of manslaughter, and all moved for a new trial. A new trial was ordered for the defendant convicted of murder, and as to the other two defendants the case was continued to allow them to decide whether they would take a new trial or abide by their convictions. Mr. Justice Grier warned these defendants:\n\n\n47\n'You ought clearly to understand and weigh well the position      in which you now stand. You have been once tried and      acquitted of the higher grade of offence charged against you      in this indictment, the penalty affixed to which is death;      but * * * you have (escaped). * * * But let me now solemnly      warn you to consider well the choice you shall make. Another      jury instead of acquitting you altogether, may find you      guilty of the whole indictment, and thus your lives may      become forfeit to the law.' 26 Fed.Cas. at page 138.\n\n\n48\nIn thus assuming that the defendants could be retried for the greater offense of murder without violating the prohibition against double jeopardy, Mr. Justice Grier evidently drew upon a familiar background and what he took to be established practice in the federal courts. To one versed in these traditions, the choice to which the defendants were put in abiding by their convictions or obtaining a new trial, on which the entire question of their guilt would be open to re-examination, seemed legally speaking a matter of course.\n\n\n49\nNot until Trono v. United States, 1905, 199 U.S. 521, 26 S.Ct. 121, 50 L.Ed. 292, more than fifty years after the Harding case, did the question that had there been passed upon by Mr. Justice Grier first come before this Court. Trono v. United States came here from the Philippine Islands. The plaintiffs in error had been proceeded against in a court of first instance on a complaint accusing them of murder in the first degree. They were acquitted of this charge, but convicted of the included offense of assault. They appealed to the Supreme Court of the Philippines, and that court, exercising a jurisdiction similar to that conferred by Spanish law on the former Audiencia to review the whole case both on the facts and the law, reversed the judgment of the court of first instance, convicted the plaintiffs in error of the crime of 'homicide,' or murder in the second degree, and increased the punishment imposed by the court of first instance. The plaintiffs in error then sought review by this Court, claiming that the action of the Supreme Court of the Philippines had placed them twice in jeopardy in contravention of the declaration of rights contained in \u00a7 5 of the Act of July 1, 1902, for the Government of the Philippines. The provision in the statute relied on by the plaintiffs in error declared that, 'no person for the same offense shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment * * *.' 32 Stat. 692. This language, it will be noted, is substantially identical with that in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, upon which petitioner in the present case relies. Its legal relation to the Fifth Amendment calls for later consideration.\n\n\n50\nThis Court affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Philippines, holding that since the plaintiffs in error had appealed their convictions of the lower offense in order to secure a reversal, there was no bar to convicting them of the higher offense in proceedings in the appellate court that were tantamount to a new trial. After canvassing state and federal precedents, Mr. Justice Peckham concluded that, 'the better doctrine is that which does not limit the court or jury, upon a new trial to a consideration of the question of guilt of the lower offense of which the accused was convicted on the first trial, but that the reversal of the judgment of conviction opens up the whole controversy, and acts upon the original judgment as if it had never been.' 199 U.S. at page 533, 26 S.Ct. at page 124. It was pointed out that in permitting retrial for the greater offense the Court only applied the principle laid down in United States v. Ball, supra, and that the result was justified not only on the theory that the accused had 'waived' their right not to be retried, but also on the ground that, 'the constitutional provision was really never intended to, and, properly construed, does not, cover the case of a judgment under these circumstances, which has been annulled by the court at the request of the accused * * *.' 199 U.S. at page 534, 26 S.Ct. at page 124.\n\n\n51\nThe Court in Trono left no doubt that its decision did not turn on any surviving peculiarities of Spanish procedure, or on the fact that the plaintiffs in error relied on a statutory provision rather than on the Fifth Amendment itself. 'We may regard the question as thus presented,' stated Mr. Justice Peckham, 'as the same as if it arose in one of the Federal courts in this country, where, upon an indictment for a greater offense, the jury had found the accused not guilty of that offense, but guilty of a lower one which was included in it, and upon an appeal from that judgment by the accused, a new trial had been granted by the appellate court, and the question was whether, upon the new trial accorded, the accused could be again tried for the greater offense * * *.' 199 U.S. at page 530, 26 S.Ct. at page 123. The dissenters did not dispute this view of the case, but on the contrary were concerned with the Court's holding precisely because of its constitutional implications. Mr. Justice Harlan adhered to the view he had taken in earlier cases that the Bill of Rights applied to the Islands, and Mr. Justice McKenna in the principal dissent observed that, 'Let it be remembered that we are dealing with a great right, I may even say a constitutional right, for the opinion of the court discusses the case as though it were from a circuit court of the United States.' 199 U.S. at page 539, 26 S.Ct. at page 125.\n\n\n52\nThe scope and significance of the Trono case is underscored by the Court's decision in Kepner v. United States, 195 U.S. 100, 24 S.Ct. 797, 49 L.Ed. 114, rendered only a year before. That case also arose in the Philippine Islands. The plaintiff in error had been acquitted by the court of first instance of the offense with which he was charged. On appeal by the Government to the Supreme Court of the Islands, the judgment was reversed and the plaintiff in error convicted. In this Court both the Attorney General for the Philippines and the Solicitor General of the United States contended that \u00a7 5 of the Act of July 1, 1902, which included the same prohibition against double jeopardy involved in the Trono case, should be construed in the light of the system of law prevailing in the Philippines before they were ceded to the United States. Brief for the Attorney General of the Philippines, pp. 6 16, 29\u201438; Brief for the Solicitor General, pp. 34\u201444. Under that jurisprudence, proceedings in the Supreme Court, or Audiencia, were regarded not as a new trial but as an extension of preliminary proceedings in the court of first instance. The entire proceedings constituted one continuous trial, and the jeopardy that attached in the court of first instance did not terminate until final judgment had been rendered by the Audiencia.\n\n\n53\nThe Court rejected the Government's contention and held that the proceedings after acquittal had placed the accused twice in jeopardy. Whatever the Spanish tradition, the purpose of Congress was 'to carry some, at least, of the essential principles of American constitutional jurisprudence to these islands, and to engraft them upon the law of this people, newly subject to our jurisdiction.' 'This case does not * * * require determination of the question whether the jeopardy clause (of the Fifth Amendment) became the law of the islands * * * without Congressional action, as the act of Congress made it the law of these possessions when the accused was tried and convicted.' 195 U.S. at pages 121\u2014122, 125, 24 S.Ct. at page 801. The Court also rejected the suggestion that the rights enumerated in the Act of Congress could have been used 'in any other sense than that which has been placed upon them in construing the instrument from which they were taken * * *.' 195 U.S., at page 124, 24 S.Ct. at page 802. Mr. Justice Holmes, dissenting, found the case 'of great importance, not only in its immediate bearing upon the administration of justice in the Philippines, but, since the words used in the Act of Congress are also in the Constitution, even more because the decision necessarily will carry with it an interpretation of the latter instrument.' 195 U.S. at page 134, 24 S.Ct. at page 806.\n\n\n54\nThe legislative history of the Philippine Bill of Rights, \u00a7 5 of the Act of July 1, 1902, made inevitable the Court's conclusion that by its enactment Congress extended to the Islands the double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment, notwithstanding surviving Spanish procedures, so that the Court should construe the statute as it would the constitutional provision itself. President McKinley, in his famous instructions to the Philippine Commission, dated April 7, 1900, drawn by a leader of the American Bar, Secretary of War Elihu Root, had stated that\n\n\n55\n'the Commission should bear in mind, and the people of the      Islands should be made plainly to understand, that there are      certain great principles of government which have been made      the basis of our governmental system, which we deem essential      to the rule of law and the maintenance of individual freedom,      and of which they have, unfortunately, been denied the      experience possessed by us; that there are also certain      practical rules of government which we have found to be essential to the preservation of these      great principles of liberty and law, and that these      principles and these rules of government must be established      and maintained in their islands for the aske of their liberty      and happiness, however, much they may conflict with the      customs or laws of procedure with which they are familiar. It      is evident that the most enlightened thought of the      Philippine Islands fully appreciates the importance of these      principles and rules, and they will inevitably within a short      time command universal assent. Upon every division and branch      of the Government of the Philippines, therefore, must be      imposed these inviolable rules:\n\n\n56\n'That no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or      property without due process of law; that private property      shall not be taken for public use without just compensation;      that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the      right to a speedy and public trial, to be informed of the      nature and cause of the accusation, to be confronted with the      witnesses against him, to have compulsory process for      obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance      of counsel for his defense; that excessive bail shall not be      required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual      punishment inflicted; that no person shall be put twice in      jeopardy for the same offense * * *.' 1 Public Laws of the      Philippine Commission, p. LXVI.3\n\n\n57\nAs the Court pointed out, 'These principles were not taken from the Spanish law; they were carefully collated from our own Constitution, and embody almost verbatim the safeguards of that instrument for the protection of life and liberty.' 195 U.S. at page 124, 24 S.Ct. at page 802. In the Act of July 1, 1902, Congress adopted, almost in the language of the President's instructions, the fundamental provisions he considered must be engrafted onto Philippine law, and the historical context in which Congress acted leaves no doubt that it was also actuated by the Same purpose as the President to extend to the Philippines 'certain great principles of government which have been made the basis of our governmental system * * *.' 1 Public Laws of the Philippine Commission, p. LXVI. In the double jeopardy provision of \u00a7 5 Congress did not fashion a novel principle specially adapted to Philippine conditions and different from what was familiar to American constitutional thought. On the contrary, it extended over those newly subject to our jurisdiction the specific command of the Fifth Amendment, as construed and developed in the decisions of this Court. The Court in Kepner and Trono cases, therefore, following the statutory language itself, emphasized by its legislative history, construed the double jeopardy provision of \u00a7 5 as though it were construing the same provision in the United States Constitution. See also Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 367 368, 30 S.Ct. 544, 549, 54 L.Ed. 793. The background of these decisions, and the expressed understanding of the Court on the nature and scope of the provision construed, make them direct authority in all cases arising under the double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment.\n\n\n58\nThe decision in Trono was emphatically a decision of the Court. Although Mr. Justice Holmes concurred in the result only, and not in the opinion of Mr. Justice Peckham, there can be no doubt of where he stood. He had dissented in the Kepner case on the ground that trial and retrial constituted one procedure entailing one continuous jeopardy, and that there could be no second jeopardy until a conviction or acquittal free from legal error had been obtained. He was dissatisfied with the opinion of Mr. Justice Peckham in the Trono case, therefore, not remotely because it upheld the accused's conviction of the greater offense, but because it did not go further and adopt the continuing jeopardy theory Mr. Justice Holmes had espoused in the Kepner case. It there was no double jeopardy for him when the Government appealed an acquittal, obviously there was none when the defendant appealed a conviction. Indeed, in Kepner he explicitly stated that he considered state cases that held the defendant could not be retried for the greater offense to be wrong.\n\n\n59\nMany statements by this Court since Trono show that the principle of that case cannot in all good conscience be rested on the criminal procedure of the Philippine Islands, but on a construction of the Fifth Amendment itself and as such binding on the entire federal judiciary. In Burton v. United States, 202 U.S. 344, 378, 26 S.Ct. 688, 697, 50 L.Ed. 1057, a case arising in the continental United States, the Court referred to the principle established by the Trono decision without any suggestion that it was confined to cases arising in the Philippines. In Brantley v. State of Georgia, 217 U.S. 284, 30 S.Ct. 514, 54 L.Ed. 768, the defendant was convicted of manslaughter under an indictment for murder. On appeal to the State Court of Appeals, the conviction was reversed and the defendant retried and convicted of murder. Although the case concerned the Due Process Clause, the Court comprehensively stated that this 'was not a case of twice in jeopardy under any view of the Constitution of the United States.' 217 U.S. at page 285, 30 S.Ct. at page 515.\n\n\n60\nOf special relevance is Stroud v. United States, 251 U.S. 15, 17\u201418, 40 S.Ct. 50, 51, 64 L.Ed. 103. In that case the defendant was indicted for murder, and the jury returned a verdict of 'guilty as charged in the indictment without capital punishment.' The judgment was reversed and a new trial had on which the defendant was again found guilty of murder, but without a recommendation against capital punishment. He was then sentenced to death. This Court expressly relied on Trono in affirming the judgment and rejecting the contention that the imposition of a greater punishment had placed the defendant twice in jeopardy. As a practical matter and on any basis of human values, it is scarcely possible to distinguish a case in which the defendant is convicted of a greater offense from one in which he is convicted of an offense that has the same name as that of which he was previously convicted but carries a significantly different punishment, namely death rather than imprisonment.\n\n\n61\nWhatever formal disclaimers may be made, neither Trono itself nor the reliance placed upon it for more than half a century permits any other conclusion than that the Court today overrules that decision. It does so, furthermore, in a case where the defendant's position is far less persuasive than it was in Trono. There the plaintiffs in error had been expressly acquitted of the greater offense, whereas in the present case petitioner relies on an 'implied acquittal' based on his conviction of the lesser offense of second degree murder and the jury's silence on the greater offense. Surely the silence of the jury is not, contrary to the Court's suggestion, to be interpreted as an express finding that the defendant is not guilty of the greater offense. All that can with confidence be said is that the jury was in fact silent. Every trial lawyer and every trial judge knows that jury verdicts are not logical products, and are due to considerations that preclude accurate guessing or logical deduction. Insofar as state cases speak of the jury's silence as an 'acquittal,' they give a fictional description of a legal result: that when a defendant is found guilty of a lesser offense under an indictment charging a more serious one, and he is content to accept this conviction, the State may not again prosecute him for the greater offense. A very different situation is presented, with considerations persuasive of a different legal result, when the defendant is not content with his conviction, but appeals and obtains a reversal. Due regard for these additional considerations is not met by stating, as though it were a self-evident proposition, that the jury's silence has, for all purposes, 'acquitted' the defendant.\n\n\n62\nMoreover, the error of the District Court, which was the basis for petitioner's appeal from his first conviction, was of a kind peculiarly likely to raise doubts that the jury on the first trial had made a considered determination of petitioner's innocence of first degree murder. By instructing on second degree murder when the evidence did not warrant a finding of such an offense, the court gave the jury an opportunity for compromise and lenity that should not have been available. The fact of the matter is that by finding petitioner guilty of arson under count one of the indictment, and of second degree murder under count two, the jury found him guilty of all the elements necessary to convict him of the first degree felony murder with which he was charged, but the judge's erroneous instruction permitted the jury, for its own undisclosed reason, to render an irrational verdict.\n\n\n63\nWe should not be so unmindful, even when constitutional questions are involved, of the principle of stare decisis, by whose circumspect observance the wisdom of this Court as an institution transcending the moment can alone be brought to bear on the difficult problems that confront us. The question in the present case is effectively indistinguishable from that in Trono. Furthermore, we are not here called upon to weigh considerations generated by changing concepts as to minimum standards of fairness, which interpretation of the Due Process Clause inevitably requires. Instead, the defense of double jeopardy is involved, whose contours are the product of history. In this situation the passage of time is not enough, and the cnviction borne to the mind of the rightness of an overturning decision must surely be of a highly compelling quality to justify overruling a well-established precedent when we are presented with no considerations fairly deemed to have been wanting to those who preceded us. Whatever might have been the allowable result if the question of retrying a defendant for the greater offense were here for the first time, to fashion a policy in favorem vitae, it is foreclosed by the decision in Trono v. United States.\n\n\n64\nEven if the question were here for the first time, we would not be justified in erecting the holding of the present case as a constitutional rule. Yet the opinion of the Court treats the question, not as one within our supervisory jurisdiction over federal criminal procedure, but as a question answered by the Fifth Amendment itself, and which therefore even Congress cannot undertake to affect.\n\n\n65\nSuch an approach misconceives the purposes of the double jeopardy provision, and without warrant from the Constitution makes an absolute of the interests of the accused in disregard of the interests of society. In Palko v. State of Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 58 S.Ct. 149, 153, 82 L.ed. 288, we held that a State could permit the prosecution to appeal a conviction of second degree murder and on retrial secure a conviction of first degree murder without violating any 'fundamental principles of liberty and justice.' Since the State's interest in obtaining a trial 'free from the corrosion of substantial legal error' was sufficient to sustain the conviction of the greater offense after an appeal by the State, it would of course sustain such a conviction if the defendant had himself appealed. Although this case defined conduct permissible under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, it cannot wisely be ignored in tracting the constitutional limits imposed on the Federal Government. Nor should we ignore the fact that a substantial body of opinion in the States permits what today the Court condemns as violative of a 'vital safeguard in our society.'4 The Court restricts Congress within limits that in the experience of many jurisdictions are not a part of the protection against double jeopardy or required by its underlying purpose, and have not been imposed upon the States in the exercise of their governmental poewrs.\n\n\n66\nUndeniably the framers of the Bill of Rights were concerned to protect defendants from oppression and from efforts to secure, through the callousness of repeated prosecutions, convictions for whose justice no man could vouch. On the other hand, they were also aware of the countervailing interest in the vindication of criminal justice, which sets outer limits to the protections for those accused of crimes. Thus if a defendant appeals his conviction and obtains a reversal, all agree, certainly in this country, that he may be retried for the same offense. The reason is, obviously, not that the defendant has consented to the second trial\u2014he would much prefer that the conviction be set aside and no further proceedings had\u2014but that the continuation of the proceedings by an appeal, together with the reversal of the conviction, are sufficient to permit a re-examination of the issue of the defendant's guilt without doing violence to the purposes behind the Double Jeopardy Clause. The balance represented by that clause leaves free another appeal to law. Since the propriety of the original proceedings has been called in question by the defendant, a complete re-examination of the issues in dispute is appropriate and not unjust. In the circumstances of the present case, likewise, the reversal of petitioner's conviction was a sufficient reason to justify a complete new trial in order that both parties might have one free from errors claimed to be prejudicial. As Mr. Justice Peckham pointed out in Trono, 'the constitutional provision was really never intended to, and, properly construed, does not, cover the case of a judgment under these circumstances, which has been annulled by the court at the request of the accused * * *.' 199 U.S. at page 534, 26 S.Ct. at page 124.\n\n\n67\nI would affirm the judgment.\n\n\n\n1\n D.C.Code, 1951, \u00a7 22\u2014401.\n\n\n2\n D.C.Code, 1951, \u00a7 22\u20142401. 'Whoever, being of sound memory and discretion * * * without purpose so to do kills another in perpetrating or in attempting to perpetrate any arson, as defined in section 22\u2014401 * * * is guilty of murder in the first degree.'\nSection 22\u20142404 provides that the 'punishment of murder in the first degree shall be death by electrocution.'\n\n\n3\n D.C.Code, 1951, \u00a7 22\u20142403. 'Whoever with malice aforethought, except as provided in (s) 22\u20142401 * * * kills another, is guilty of murder in the second degree.'\n\u00a7 22\u20142404. 'The punishment of murder in the second degree shall be imprisonment for life, or for not less than twenty years.'\n\n\n4\n 4 Blackstone's Commentaries 335.\n\n\n5\n And see United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662, 669, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 1194, 41 L.Ed. 300:\n'The prohibition is not against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy; and the accused, whether convicted or acquitted, is equally put in jeopardy at the first trial.'\n\n\n6\n See 1 Stephen, History of the Criminal Law of England, c.x; United States v. Gibert, 25 Fed.Cas. page 1287, No. 15,204.\n\n\n7\n Under English law the appellate court has no power to order a new trial after any appeal except in certain cases where the first trial was a complete 'nullity,' as for example when the trial court was without jurisdiction over the person or subject matter. See 4 Stephen, Commentaries on the Laws of England (21st ed. 1950), 284. The English appellate court does have power to substitute a finding of guilt of a lesser offense if the evidence warrants, but it cannot find the defendant guilty of an offense for which he was acquitted or increase his sentence. See 10 Halsbury, Laws of England (Simonds ed. 1955), 539\u2014541, and the cases cited there.\n\n\n8\n See, e.g., Brewster v. Swope, 9 Cir., 180 F.2d 984; State v. McCord, 8 Kan. 232, 12 Am.Rep. 469; Cross v. Commonwealth, 195 Va. 62, 77 S.E.2d 447; Smith v. State, 196 Wis. 102, 219 N.W. 270.\n\n\n9\n See, e.g., State v. Aus, 105 Mont. 82, 69 P.2d 584. Cf. Griffin v. People of State of Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 18, 76 S.Ct. 585, 590, 100 L.Ed. 891.\n\n\n10\n In substance the situation was the same as though Green had been charged with these different offenses in separate but alternative counts of the indictment. The constitutional issues at stake here should not turn on the fact that both offenses were charged to the jury under one count.\n\n\n11\n It should be noted that Green's claim of former jeopardy is not based on his previous conviction for second degree murder but instead on the original jury's refusal to convict him of first degree murder.\n\n\n12\n Many of the state courts which have considered the problem have concluded that under circumstances similar to those of this case a defendant cannot be tried a second time for first degree murder. Other state cases take a contrary position. In general see the Annotations at 59 A.L.R. 1160, 22 L.R.A.,N.S., 959, and 5 L.R.A.,N.S., 571. Of course, many of the state decisions rest on local constitutional or statutory provisions.\n\n\n13\n See cases collected in the Annotations cited in n. 12, supra, and the Annotation at 114 A.L.R. 1406.\n\n\n14\n The suggestion is made that under the District Code second degree murder is not an offense included in a charge of first degree murder for causing a death in the course of perpetrating a felony (commonly referred to as 'felony murder') because it involves elements different from those necessary to establish the felony murder, and that therefore Green could not legally have been convicted of second degree murder under the indictment. We fail to comprehand how this suggestion aids the Government. In the first place, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has expressly held that second degree murder is a lesser offense which can be proved under a charge of felony murder. Goodall v. United States, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 148, 180 F.2d 397, 17 A.L.R.2d 1070; Green v. United States, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 45, 218 F.2d 856. Even more important, Green's plea of former jeopardy does not rest on his conviction for second degree murder but instead on the first jury's refusal to find him guilty of felony murder.\nIt is immaterial whether second degree murder is a lesser offense included in a charge of felony murder or not. The vital thing is that it is a distinct and different offense. If anything, the fact that it cannot be classified as 'a lesser included offense' under the charge of felony murder buttresses our conclusion that Green was unconstitutionally twice placed in jeopardy. American courts have held with uniformity that where a defendant is charged with two offenses, neither of which is a lesser offense included within the other, and has been found guilty on one but not on the second he cannot be tried again on the second even though he secures reversal of the conviction and even though the two offenses are related offenses charged in the same indictment. See, e.g., Annotation, 114 A.L.R. 1406.\n\n\n15\n With the exception of Trono, the Government appears to concede in its brief, pp. 38\u201439, that the double jeopardy problem raised in this case has not been squarely before this Court. Palko v. State of Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 58 S.Ct. 149, 82 L.Ed. 288; Brantley v. State of Georgia, 217 U.S. 284, 30 S.Ct. 514, 54 L.Ed. 768, and Kring v. State of Missouri, 107 U.S. 221, 2 S.Ct. 443, 27 L.Ed. 506, are not controlling here since they involved trials in state courts. Stroud v. United States, 251 U.S. 15, 40 S.Ct. 50, 64 L.Ed. 103, is clearly distinguishable. In that case a defendant was retried for first degree murder after he had successfully asked an appellate court to set aside a prior conviction for that same offense.\n\n\n16\n In the course of his opinion Mr. Justice Peckham made some general observations to the effect that he regarded the statutory provision as having the same effect as the Fifth Amendment. Those remarks were not essential to the decision so that even if they had been accepted by the full Court they would not be conclusive in this case where the interpretation of the Fifth Amendment is necessarily decisive. Cf. Cohens v. Commonwealth of Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399, 5 L.Ed. 257; Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 626\u2014627, 55 S.Ct. 869, 873, 79 L.Ed. 1611.\n\n\n17\n Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice McKenna who dissented with Mr. Justice Holmes in Kepner refused to agree with the Court in Trono. In his dissent in the latter case Mr. Justice McKenna attributed his vote in Kepner to the fact that the Philippine Islands had a system of jurisprudence which was totally different from ours in that it provided no trial by jury and traditionally had permitted appellate courts to review both the law and the facts in criminal cases and to substitute their findings for those made by the trial judge. Justice Peckham, in his opinion, also recognized the peculiar nature of these Phillippine procedures.\n\n\n1\n 'nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb * * *.'\n\n\n2\n In reversing petitioner's conviction the court observed that: 'In seeking a new trial at which\u2014if the evidence is substantially as before\u2014the jury would have no choice except to find him guilty of first degree murder or to acquit him, Green is manifestly taking a desperate chance. He may suffer the death penalty. At oral argument we inquired of his counsel whether Green clearly understood the possible consequence of success on this appeal, and were told the appellant, who is 64 years of age, says he prefers death to spending the rest of his life in prison. He is entitled to a new trial.' 95 U.S.App.D.C. 45, 48, 218 F.2d 856, 859.\n\n\n3\n These instructions were drawn up for the guidance of the commission headed by William Howard Taft. In 1912, W. Cameron Forbes, then Governor General of the Philippines, asked Taft 'what the history of the formation of the Philippine policy was, who it was that had written the instructions by President McKinley to the Taft Commission. He informed me that this was the work of Secretary Root, who wrote the letter of instructions, after which he had read them over to him (Judge Taft) and other members of his Commission, and that some suggestions and modifications were made but that the main work was intact.' 1 Forbes, The Philippine Islands, 130, n. 2. In an address in 1913, Taft stated that the instructions 'had a conspicuous place in the history of our relations to the Philippines, and a Congressional indorsement, given to but few documents in the whole history of our country. It secured to the Philippine people all the guaranties of our Bill of Rights except trial by jury and the right to bear arms. It was issued by President McKinley as commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy in the exercise of a power which Congress was glad to leave to him without intervention for four years. He had thus the absolute control of what should be done in the way of establishing government in the Philippine Islands, and this letter to Mr. Root was the fundamental law of a civil government established under military authority. Subsequently, in 1902, when Congress assumed responsibility, it formally adopted and expressly ratified this letter of instructions, and declared that it, as supplemented by the remaining provisions of the statute, should be the Constitution of the Government of the Philippine Islands, and the charter of the liberties of the Filipino people.' 2 Forbes, The Philippine Islands, 500.\n\n\n4\n Of the 36 States that have considered the question, 19 permit retrial for the greater offense:\nColorado.\u2014See Young v.

{"text":"452 U.S. 692\n101 S.Ct. 2587\n69 L.Ed.2d 340\nState of MICHIGAN, Petitioner,v.George SUMMERS.\nNo. 79-1794.\nArgued Feb. 25, 1981.\nDecided June 22, 1981.\n\n\nSyllabus\n\nWhen police officers executing a warrant to search a house for narcotics encountered respondent descending the front steps, they requested his assistance in gaining entry and detained him while they searched the premises.  After finding narcotics and ascertaining that respondent owned the house, the police arrested him, searched his person, and found heroin in his coat pocket. Respondent, who was charged with possession of the heroin found on his person, moved to suppress the heroin as the product of an illegal search in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  The trial judge granted the motion and quashed the information, and both the Michigan Court of Appeals and the Michigan Supreme Court affirmed.\nHeld :  The initial detention of respondent, which constituted a \"seizure\" and was assumed to be unsupported by probable cause, did not violate his constitutional right to be secure against an unreasonable seizure of his person.  For Fourth Amendment purposes, a warrant to search for contraband founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.  Because it was lawful to require respondent to re-enter and to remain in the house until evidence establishing probable cause to arrest him was found, his arrest and the search incident thereto were constitutionally permissible.

S., as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\nGerald M. Lorence, Detroit, Mich., for respondent.\nBruce J. Ennis, Jr., New York City, for the American Civil Liberties Union, as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\nJustice STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nAs Detroit police officers were about to execute a warrant to search a house for narcotics, they encountered respondent descending the front steps.  They requested his assistance in gaining entry and detained him while they searched the premises. After finding narcotics in the basement and ascertaining that respondent owned the house, the police arrested him, searched his person, and found in his coat pocket an envelope containing 8.5 grams of heroin.1\n\n\n2\nRespondent was charged with possession of the heroin found on his person.  He moved to suppress the heroin as the product of an illegal search in violation of the Fourth Amendment,2 and the trial judge granted the motion and quashed the information.  That order was affirmed by a divided panel of the Michigan Court of Appeals, 68 Mich.App. 571, 243 N.W.2d 689, and by the Michigan Supreme Court over the dissent of three of its justices.  407 Mich. 432, 286 N.W.2d 226.  We granted the State's petition for certiorari, 449 U.S. 898, 101 S.Ct. 265, 66 L.Ed.2d 127, and now reverse.\n\n\n3\n* The dispositive question in this case is whether the initial detention of respondent violated his constitutional right to be secure against an unreasonable seizure of his person.  The State attempts to justify the eventual search of respondent's person by arguing that the authority to search premises granted by the warrant implicitly included the authority to search persons on those premises, just as that authority included an authorization to search furniture and containers in which the particular things described might be concealed.  But as the Michigan Court of Appeals correctly noted, even if otherwise acceptable, this argument could not justify the initial detention of respondent outside the premises described in the warrant.  See 68 Mich.App., at 578-580, 243 N.W. 2d, at 692-693.  If that detention was permissible, there is no need to reach the question whether a search warrant for premises includes the right to search persons found there, because when the police searched respondent, they had probable cause to arrest him and had done so.3  Our appraisal of the validity of the search of respondent's person therefore depends upon a determination whether the officers had the authority to require him to re-enter the house and to remain there while they conducted their search.4\n\nII\n\n4\nIn assessing the validity of respondent's initial detention, we note first that it constituted a \"seizure\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.5  The State does not contend otherwise, and the record demonstrates that respondent was not free to leave the premises while the officers were searching his home.  It is also clear that respondent was not formally arrested until after the search was completed.  The dispute therefore involves only the constitutionality of a pre-arrest \"seizure\" which we assume was unsupported by probable cause.\n\n\n5\nIn Dunaway v. New York, 442 U.S. 200, 99 S.Ct. 2248, 60 L.Ed.2d 824, the Court reaffirmed the general rule that an official seizure of the person must be supported by probable cause, even if no formal arrest is made.  In that case police officers located a murder suspect at a neighbor's house, took him into custody, and transported him to the police station, where interrogation ultimately produced a confession.  Because the suspect was not arrested until after he had confessed, and because he presumably would have been set free if probable cause had not been established during his questioning, the State argued that the pre-arrest detention should not be equated with an arrest and should be upheld as \"reasonable\" in view of the serious character of the crime and the fact that the police had an articulable basis for suspecting that Dunaway was involved.  Id., at 207, 99 S.Ct., at 2253.  The Court firmly rejected the State's argument, noting that \"the detention of petitioner was in important respects indistinguishable from a traditional arrest.\" Id., at 212, 99 S.Ct., at 2256.6  We stated:\n\n\n6\n\"Indeed, any 'exception' that could cover a seizure as      intrusive as that in this case would threaten to swallow the      general rule that Fourth Amendment seizures are 'reasonable'      only if based on probable cause.\n\n\n7\n\"The central importance of the probable-cause      requirement to the protection of a citizen's privacy afforded      by the Fourth Amendment's guarantees cannot be compromised in      this fashion.  'The requirement of probable cause has roots      that are deep in our history.'  Henry v. United States, 361      U.S. 98, 100 [80 S.Ct. 168, 170, 4 L.Ed.2d 134] (1959).      Hostility to seizures based on mere suspicion was a prime      motivation for the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, and      decisions immediately after its adoption affirmed that      'common rumor or report, suspicion, or even \"strong reason to      suspect\" was not adequate to support a warrant for arrest.'      Id., at 101 [80 S.Ct., at 170] (footnotes omitted).  The      familiar threshold standard of probable cause for Fourth      Amendment seizures reflects the benefit of extensive      experience accommodating the factors relevant to the      'reasonableness' requirement of the Fourth Amendment, and      provides the relative simplicity and clarity necessary to the      implementation of a workable rule.  See Brinegar v. United      States, [338 U.S., at 175-176, 69 S.Ct., at 1310-1311].\"      Id., at 213, 99 S.Ct., at 2256.\n\n\n8\nAlthough we refused in Dunaway to find an exception that would swallow the general rule, our opinion recognized that some seizures significantly less intrusive than an arrest have withstood scrutiny under the reasonableness standard embodied in the Fourth Amendment.  In these cases the intrusion on the citizen's privacy \"was so much less severe\" than that involved in a traditional arrest that \"the opposing interests in crime prevention and detection and in the police officer's safety\" could support the seizure as reasonable.  Id., at 209, 99 S.Ct., at 2254.\n\n\n9\nIn the first such case, Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, the Court recognized the narrow authority of police officers who suspect criminal activity to make limited intrusions on an individual's personal security based on less than probable cause.  The Court approved a \"frisk\" for weapons as a justifiable response to an officer's reasonable belief that he was dealing with a possibly armed and dangerous suspect.7  In the second such case, Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612, the Court relied on Terry to hold that an officer could forcibly stop a suspect to investigate an informant's tip that the suspect was armed and carrying narcotics.8  And in United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607, the Court held that the special enforcement problems confronted by roving Border Patrol agents, though not sufficient to justify random stops of vehicles near the Mexican border to question their occupants about their citizenship, id., at 882-884, 95 S.Ct., at 2580-2581,9 were adequate to support vehicle stops based on the agents' awareness of specific articulable facts indicating that the vehicle contained illegal aliens.  The Court reasoned that the difficulty in patrolling the long Mexican border and the interest in controlling the influx of illegal aliens justified the limited intrusion, usually lasting no more than a minute, involved in the stop.  Id., at 878-880, 95 S.Ct., at 2578, 2579.10  See also United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621.\n\n\n10\nThese cases recognize that some seizures admittedly covered by the Fourth Amendment constitute such limited intrusions on the personal security of those detained and are justified by such substantial law enforcement interests that they may be made on less than probable cause, so long as police have an articulable basis for suspecting criminal activity.  In these cases, as inDunaway, the Court was applying the ultimate standard of reasonableness embodied in the Fourth Amendment.11  They are consistent with the general rule that every arrest, and every seizure having the essential attributes of a formal arrest, is unreasonable unless it is supported by probable cause.  But they demonstrate that the exception for limited intrusions that may be justified by special law enforcement interests is not confined to the momentary, on-the-street detention accompanied by a frisk for weapons involved in Terry and Adams.12  Therefore, in order to decide whether this case is controlled by the general rule, it is necessary to examine both the character of the official intrusion and its justification.\n\nIII\n\n11\nOf prime importance in assessing the intrusion is the fact that the police had obtained a warrant to search respondent's house for contraband.  A neutral and detached magistrate had found probable cause to believe that the law was being violated in that house and had authorized a substantial invasion of the privacy of the persons who resided there.  The detention of one of the residents while the premises were searched, although admittedly a significant restraint on his liberty, was surely less intrusive than the search itself.13  Indeed, we may safely assume that most citizens\u2014unless they intend flight to avoid arrest\u2014would elect to remain in order to observe the search of their possessions. Furthermore, the type of detention imposed here is not likely to be exploited by the officer or unduly prolonged in order to gain more information, because the information the officers seek normally will be obtained through the search and not through the detention.14 Moreover, because the detention in this case was in respondent's own residence, it could add only minimally to the public stigma associated with the search itself and would involve neither the inconvenience nor the indignity associated with a compelled visit to the police station.15  In sharp contrast to the custodial interrogation in Dunaway, the detention of this respondent was \"substantially less intrusive\" than an arrest.  442 U.S., at 210, 99 S.Ct., at 2255.16\n\n\n12\nIn assessing the justification for the detention of an occupant of premises being searched for contraband pursuant to a valid warrant, both the law enforcement interest and the nature of the \"articulable facts\" supporting the detention are relevant. Most obvious is the legitimate law enforcement interest in preventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found.  Less obvious, but sometimes of greater importance, is the interest in minimizing the risk of harm to the officers.  Although no special danger to the police is suggested by the evidence in this record, the execution of a warrant to search for narcotics is the kind of transaction that may give rise to sudden violence or frantic efforts to conceal or destroy evidence.17  The risk of harm to both the police and the occupants is minimized if the officers routinely exercise unquestioned command of the situation.  Cf. 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 4.9, pp. 150-151 (1978).  Finally, the orderly completion of the search may be facilitated if the occupants of the premises are present.  Their self-interest may induce them to open locked doors or locked containers to avoid the use of force that is not only damaging to property but may also delay the completion of the task at hand.\n\n\n13\nIt is also appropriate to consider the nature of the articulable and individualized suspicion on which the police base the detention of the occupant of a home subject to a search warrant.  We have already noted that the detention represents only an incremental intrusion on personal liberty when the search of a home has been authorized by a valid warrant.  The existence of a search warrant, however, also provides an objective justification for the detention.  A judicial officer has determined that police have probable cause to believe that someone in the home is committing a crime.  Thus a neutral magistrate rather than an officer in the field has made the critical determination that the police should be given a special authorization to thrust themselves into the privacy of a home.18  The connection of an occupant to that home gives the police officer an easily identifiable and certain basis for determining that suspicion of criminal activity justifies a detention of that occupant.\n\n\n14\nIn Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639, we held that police officers may not enter a private residence to make a routine felony arrest without first obtaining a warrant.  In that case we rejected the suggestion that only a search warrant could adequately protect the privacy interests at stake, noting that the distinction between a search warrant and an arrest warrant was far less significant than the interposition of the magistrate's determination of probable cause between the zealous officer and the citizen:\n\n\n15\n\"It is true that an arrest warrant requirement may afford      less protection than a search warrant requirement, but it      will suffice to interpose the magistrate's determination of      probable cause between the zealous officer and the citizen.      If there is sufficient evidence of a citizen's participation      in a felony to persuade a judicial officer that his arrest is      justified, it is constitutionally reasonable to require him      to open his doors to the officers of the law.  Thus, for      Fourth Amendment purposes, an arrest warrant founded on      probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited      authority to enter a dwelling in which the suspect lives when      there is reason to believe the suspect is within.\"  Id., at      602-603, 100 S.Ct., at 1388.\n\n\n16\nThat holding is relevant today.  If the evidence that a citizen's residence is harboring contraband is sufficient to persuade a judicial officer that an invasion of the citizen's privacy is justified, it is constitutionally reasonable to require that citizen to remain while officers of the law execute a valid warrant to search his home.19  Thus, for Fourth Amendment purposes, we hold that a warrant to search for contraband20 founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.21\n\n\n17\nBecause it was lawful to require respondent to re-enter and to remain in the house until evidence establishing probable cause to arrest him was found, his arrest and the search incident thereto were constitutionally permissible.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Michigan must therefore be reversed.\n\n\n18\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n19\nJustice STEWART, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting.\n\n\n20\nThe Court is correct in stating that \"some seizures significantly less intrusive than an arrest have withstood scrutiny under the reasonableness standard embodied in the Fourth Amendment.\"  Ante, at 697.  But to escalate this statement into some kind of a general rule is to ignore the protections that the Fourth Amendment guarantees to us all.  There are only two types of seizures that need not be based on probable cause.  The first, represented by the Terry line of cases, is a limited stop to question a person and to perform a pat-down for weapons when the police have reason to believe that he is armed and dangerous.  E. g., Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 23-24, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1881, 20 L.Ed.2d 889.  The second is a brief stop of vehicles near our international borders to question occupants of the vehicles about their citizenship.  E. g. United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 881, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 2580, 45 L.Ed.2d 607.\n\n\n21\nFrom these two special exceptions to the general prohibition on seizures not based on probable cause, the Court leaps to the very broad idea that courts may approve a wide variety of seizures not based on probable cause, so long as the courts find, after balancing the law enforcement purposes of the police conduct against the severity of their intrusion, that the seizure appears \"reasonable.\"  Ante, at 700-701, and nn. 11, 12.  But those two lines of cases do not represent some sort of exemplary balancing test for Fourth Amendment cases.  Rather, they represent two isolated exceptions to the general rule that the Fourth Amendment itself has already performed the constitutional balance between police objectives and personal privacy.  The seizure permitted by the Court today, the detention of a person at his home while the police execute a search warrant for contraband inside it, is categorically different from those two special exceptions to the warrant and probable-cause requirement, and poses a significantly greater threat to the protections guaranteed by the Constitution.\n\n\n22\n* The common denominator of the Terry cases and the border checkpoint cases is the presence of some governmental interest independent of the ordinary interest in investigating crime and apprehending suspects, an interest important enough to overcome the presumptive constitutional restraints on police conduct.  At issue in Terry was \"more than the governmental interest in investigating crime;  in addition, there is the more immediate interest of the police officer in taking steps to assure himself that the person with whom he is dealing is not armed with a weapon that could unexpectedly and fatally be used against him.\"  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S., at 23, 88 S.Ct., at 1881.  Though the officer in Terry was engaged in investigating crime, the governmental purpose that justified the stop and patdown was not the investigation itself, but \"the neutralization of danger to the policeman in the investigative circumstance.\"  Id., at 26, 88 S.Ct., at 1882.  Stating its essential holding, the Court said: \"When an officer is justified in believing that the individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others, it would appear to be clearly unreasonable to deny the officer the power to take necessary measures to determine whether the person is in fact carrying a weapon and to neutralize the threat of physical harm.\"  Id., at 24, 88 S.Ct., at 1881.\n\n\n23\nSimilarly, in Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612, the officer had received an informant's tip, not amounting to probable cause, that Williams was carrying narcotics and a gun.  The Court held that the officer acted legally in reaching into the car and intruding on Williams' person to see if Williams indeed was in possession of a lethal weapon.  In so holding, the Court made clear that what justified this intrusion on Williams' person was not the possibility of finding contraband narcotics, but rather the officer's need to protect himself from harm by seizing the suspected gun:  \"The purpose of this limited search is not to discover evidence of crime, but to allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence . . . .\"  Id., at 146, 92 S.Ct., at 1923, accord, Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U.S. 106, 110, 98 S.Ct. 330, 333, 54 L.Ed.2d 331.  See Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 93, 100 S.Ct. 338, 343, 62 L.Ed.2d 238.\n\n\n24\nIn United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, supra, the Court approved a limited stop of vehicles by patrols of immigration officers near the Mexican border, but in doing so it stressed the unique governmental interest in preventing the illegal entry of aliens. The Court held that brief stops and inquiries based on less than probable cause to search or arrest were necessary because the entry of undocumented aliens creates \"significant economic and social problems, competing with citizens and legal resident aliens for jobs, and generating extra demand for social services.\"  422 U.S., at 878-879, 95 S.Ct., at 2579.  And in United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116, upholding similarly brief stops and inquiries at permanent checkpoints, the Court relied on the unique difficulty of patrolling a 2,000-mile long and virtually uninhabited border area, a difficulty that would prove insuperable if the Government could stop a vehicle only on the basis of probable cause to believe that that particular vehicle contained illegal entrants. Id., at 552, 96 S.Ct., at 3080.\n\n\n25\nIt seems clear, therefore, that before a court can uphold a detention on less than probable cause on the ground that it is \"reasonable\" in the light of the competing interests, the government must demonstrate an important purpose beyond the normal goals of criminal investigation, or must demonstrate an extraordinary obstacle to such investigation.\n\nII\n\n26\nWhat the Court approves today is justified by no such special governmental interest or law enforcement need.  There were only two governmental purposes supporting the detention of the respondent.1  One was \"the legitimate law enforcement interest in preventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found.\"  Ante, at 702.  The other was that \"the orderly completion of the search may be facilitated if the occupants of the premises are present.\"  Ante, at 703.  Unlike the law enforcement objectives that justified the police conduct in Terry and the border stop cases, these objectives represented nothing more than the ordinary police interest in discovering evidence of crime and apprehending wrongdoers.  And the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments impose significant restraints upon these traditional police activities, even though the police and the courts may find those restraints unreasonably inconvenient.\n\n\n27\nIf the police, acting without probable cause, can seize a person to make him available for arrest in case probable cause is later developed to arrest him, the requirement of probable cause for arrest has been turned upside down.  And if the police may seize a person without probable cause in order to \"facilitate\" the execution of a warrant that did not authorize his arrest, the fundamental principle that the scope of a search and seizure can be justified only by the scope of the underlying warrant has suffered serious damage.  There is no authority in this Court for the principle that the police can engage in searches and seizures without probable cause simply because to do so enhances their ability to conduct investigations which may eventually lead to probable cause.  See Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721, 726-727, 89 S.Ct. 1394, 1397, 22 L.Ed.2d 676.2\n\n\n28\nBeyond the issue of the governmental interest justifying the detention, I question the Court's view that the detention here is of the limited, unintrusive sort that permits the Court to engage in a \"reasonableness\" balancing test.  As the Court said in Dunaway v. New York, 442 U.S. 200, 210, 99 S.Ct. 2248, 2255, 60 L.Ed.2d 824, Terry v. Ohio \"defined a special category of Fourth Amendment 'seizures' so substantially less intrusive than arrests that the general rule requiring probable cause to make Fourth Amendment 'seizures' reasonable could be replaced by a balancing test.\"  (Emphasis added.)  As we then noted in Dunaway, the patdown searches in Terry, Adams, and Mimms were declared legal because they were extremely limited in time and in the degree of personal intrusion.  442 U.S., at 210-211, 99 S.Ct., at 2255-2256. The Court also noted that in the border cases, the stops normally consumed less than a minute and involved no more than brief interrogation.  Id., at 211, 99 S.Ct., at 2256.  Thus, in the rare cases in which the Court has permitted an independent balancing of interests, the police intrusion has been extremely narrow. Moreover, the Court has required that the stop and inquiry or search be \"reasonably related in scope to the justification for their initiation,\" Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S., at 29, 88 S.Ct., at 1884, see United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S., at 881, 95 S.Ct., at 2580, and, under that requirement, the unusual governmental or law enforcement interests justifying the patdown stops and border stops have provided a limiting principle ensuring the narrowness of the police action.  The detention approved by the Court today, however, is of a very different order.\n\n\n29\nThe explicit holding of the Court is that \"a warrant to search for contraband founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.\"   Ante, at 705 (footnotes omitted).  Though on superficial reading, this language may suggest a minor intrusion of brief duration, a detention \"while a proper search is being conducted\" can mean a detention of several hours.3  The police thereby make the person a prisoner in his own home for a potentially very long period of time.4 Moreover, because of the questionable nature of the governmental interest asserted by the State and acknowledged by the Court in this case, the requirement that the scope of the intrusion be reasonably related to its justification does not provide a limiting principle for circumscribing the detention.  If the purpose of the detention is to help the police make the search, the detention can be as long as the police find it necessary to protract the search.5\n\n\n30\nIn Dunaway, the Court reaffirmed that the \" 'long-prevailing standards' of probable cause embodied 'the best compromise that has been found for accommodating [the] often opposing interests' in 'safeguard[ing] citizens from rash and unreasonable interferences with privacy' and in 'seek[ing] to give fair leeway for enforcing the law in the community's protection.' \"  442 U.S., at 208, 99 S.Ct., at 2254, quoting Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 176, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1311, 93 L.Ed. 1879.  Because the present case presents no occasion for departing from this principle, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n The execution of the warrant is described in greater detail in Justice Moody's opinion for the Michigan Supreme Court:\n\"Upon arriving at the named address, Officer Roger Lehman saw the defendant go out the front door of the house and proceed across the porch and down the steps.  When defendant was asked to open the door he replied that he could not because he left his keys inside, but he could ring someone over the intercom.  Dwight Calhoun came to the door, but did not admit the police officers. As a result, the officers obtained entrance to the premises by forcing open the front door.  Once admittance had been gained Officer Lehman instructed Officer Conant, previously stationed along the side of the house, to bring the defendant, still on the porch, into the house.\n\"After the eight occupants of the house were detained, a search of the premises revealed two plastic bags of suspected narcotics under the bar in the basement.  After finding the suspected narcotics in the basement and upon determining that the defendant was the owner of the house, Officer Conant formally arrested the defendant for violation of the Controlled Substances Act of 1971.  M.C.L. \u00a7 335.341(4)(a);  M.S.A. \u00a7 18.1070(41)(4)(a). A custodial search conducted by Officer Conant revealed a plastic bag containing suspected heroin in the defendant's jacket pocket. It is this heroin, discovered on the person of the defendant, that forms the basis of the instant possession charge.\"  407 Mich. 432, 441, 286 N.W.2d 226, 226-227.\n\n\n2\n The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:\n\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\"\nThe Fourteenth Amendment requires the several States to secure these rights.  See Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 576, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 1374, 63 L.Ed.2d 639;  Dunaway v. New York, 442 U.S. 200, 207, 99 S.Ct. 2248, 2253, 60 L.Ed.2d 824.\n\n\n3\n Because there were several other occupants of the house, under Michigan law the evidence that narcotics had been found in the basement of respondent's house would apparently be insufficient to support a conviction.  See People v. Davenport, 39 Mich.App. 252, 197 N.W.2d 521 (1972).  The Michigan Court of Appeals relied on Davenport to conclude that the officers did not have probable cause to arrest or search respondent even though he was the owner of a house in which contraband was found.  68 Mich.App., at 580-582, 243 N.W.2d, at 692-693.  Judge Bashara, dissenting in the Court of Appeals, id., at 585, 243 N.W.2d, at 695, and the three dissenting justices of the Michigan Supreme court, 407 Mich., at 450, 463-464, 286 N.W.2d, at 231, 237, pointed out that Davenport, which concerns the proof necessary to support a conviction, is not dispositive of the question whether the police had probable cause to arrest.  See Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 174-176, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1310-1311, 93 L.Ed. 1879.  Regardless of whether the police had probable cause to arrest respondent under Michigan law, probable cause within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment is not at issue here.  Respondent does not challenge the conclusion that the evidence found in his home established probable cause to arrest him.  See Brief for Respondent 17.\n\n\n4\n The \"seizure\" issue in this case should not be confused with the \"search\" issue presented in Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 100 S.Ct. 338, 62 L.Ed.2d 238.  In Ybarra the police executing a search warrant for a public tavern detained and searched all of the customers who happened to be present.  No question concerning the legitimacy of the detention was raised.  Rather, the Court concluded that the search of Ybarra was invalid because the police had no reason to believe he had any special connection with the premises, and the police had no other basis for suspecting that he was armed or in possession of contraband.  See id., at 90-93, 100 S.Ct., at 341-343.  In this case, only the detention is at issue. The police knew respondent lived in the house, and they did not search him until after they had probable cause to arrest and had done so.\n\n\n5\n \"It is quite plain that the Fourth Amendment governs 'seizures' of the person which do not eventuate in a trip to the station house and prosecution for crime\u2014'arrests' in traditional terminology.  It must be recognized that whenever a police officer accosts an individual and restrains his freedom to walk away, he has 'seized' that person.\"  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 16, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1877, 20 L.Ed.2d 889.\n\n\n6\n The Court noted that Dunaway was \"taken from a neighbor's home to a police car, transported to a police station, and placed in an interrogation room.\"  He was not informed that he was free to leave;  he would not have been free to leave and would have been physically restrained had he attempted to do so.  442 U.S., at 212, 99 S.Ct., at 2256.\n\n\n7\n In upholding the \"frisk\" employed by the officer in that case, the Court assumed, without explicitly stating, that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit forcible stops when the officer has a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is being committed.  See 392 U.S., at 32-33, 88 S.Ct., at 1885-1886 (HARLAN, J., concurring);  id., at 34, 88 S.Ct., at 1886 (WHITE, J., concurring).  In Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S., at 146, 92 S.Ct., at 1923, the Court made explicit what was implicit in Terry:\n\"A brief stop of a suspicious individual, in order to determine his identity or to maintain the status quo momentarily while obtaining more information, may be most reasonable in light of the facts known to the officer at the time.\"\nSee also United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607;  United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621.\n\n\n8\n The Court noted that the informant's tip was insufficient to justify an arrest or search based on probable cause under Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637, and Aquilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723, but the information \"carried enough indicia of reliability to justify the officer's forcible stop of Williams.\"  407 U.S., at 147, 92 S.Ct., at 1924.\n\n\n9\n In several cases, the Court has concluded that the absence of any articulable facts available to the officer rendered a detention unreasonable.  In Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 663, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1401, 59 L.Ed.2d 660, the Court held that police could not make random stops of vehicles in order to check drivers' licenses and vehicle registrations in the absence of \"articulable and reasonable suspicion\" that the motorist was unlicensed or the car unregistered.  In Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47, 99 S.Ct. 2637, 61 L.Ed.2d 357, we held that a statute requiring individuals to identify themselves was unconstitutional as applied because the police did not have any reasonable suspicion that the petitioner had committed or was committing a crime.  Finally, in Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 100 S.Ct. 338, 62 L.Ed.2d 238, we held that police executing a search warrant at a tavern could not invoke Terry to frisk a patron unless the officers had individualized suspicion that the patron might be armed or dangerous.\n\n\n10\n The detention approved in Brignoni-Ponce did not encompass a search of the vehicle.  The Court had held in Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596, that such a search must be supported by probable cause.  In United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116, the Court held that stops at permanent checkpoints involved even less intrusion to a motorist than the detention by the roving patrol, and thus a stop at such a checkpoint need not even be based on any individualized suspicion.\n\n\n11\n In his opinion for the Court in Terry, Chief Justice Warren identified \"the central inquiry under the Fourth Amendment\" as \"the reasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen's personal security.\"  392 U.S., at 19, 88 S.Ct., at 1878.  Before analyzing the specific stop and frisk involved in that case, he stated:\n\"The scheme of the Fourth Amendment becomes meaningful only when it is assured that at some point the conduct of those charged with enforcing the laws can be subjected to the more detached, neutral scrutiny of a judge who must evaluate the reasonableness of a particular search or seizure in light of the particular circumstances.  And in making that assessment it is imperative that the facts be judged against an objective standard:  would the facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure or the search 'warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief' that the action taken was appropriate?  Cf. Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, [45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543] (1925);  Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 96-97, [85 S.Ct. 223, 228, 13 L.Ed.2d 142] (1964).\" Id., at 21-22, 88 S.Ct., at 1879-1880 (footnotes omitted).\n\n\n12\n Justice WHITE, concurring in Dunaway, noted that Terry is not \"an almost unique exception to a hard-and-fast standard of probable cause.\"  Rather, \"the key principle of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness\u2014the balancing of competing interests.\" 442 U.S., at 219, 99 S.Ct., at 2260.  If the purpose underlying a Terry stop\u2014investigating possible criminal activity\u2014is to be served, the police must under certain circumstances be able to detain the individual for longer than the brief time period involved in Terry and Adams.  As one commentator observed:\n\"It is clear that there are several investigative techniques which may be utilized effectively in the course of a Terry-type stop.  The most common is interrogation, which may include both a request for identification and inquiry concerning the suspicious conduct of the person detained.  Sometimes the officer will communicate with others, either police or private citizens, in an effort to verify the explanation tendered or to confirm the identification or determine whether a person of that identity is otherwise wanted.  Or, the suspect may be detained while it is determined if in fact an offense has occurred in the area, a process which might involve checking certain premises, locating and examining objects abandoned by the suspect, or talking with other people.  If it is known that an offense has occurred in the area, the suspect may be viewed by witnesses to the crime.  There is no reason to conclude that any investigative methods of the type just listed are inherently objectionable;  they might cast doubt upon the reasonableness of the detention, however, if their use makes the period of detention unduly long or involves moving the suspect to another locale.\"  3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.2, pp. 36-37 (1978).\n\n\n13\n \"As the Court reiterated just a few years ago, the 'physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed.'  United States v. United States District Court, 407 U.S. 297, 313, [92 S.Ct. 2125, 2134, 32 L.Ed.2d 752].  And we have long adhered to the view that the warrant procedure minimizes the danger of needless intrusions of that sort.\"  Payton v. New York, 445 U.S., at 585-586, 100 S.Ct., at 1379-1380.\n\n\n14\n Professor LaFave has noted that the reasonableness of a detention may be determined in part by \"whether the police are diligently pursuing a means of investigation which is likely to resolve the matter one way or another very soon. . . .\"  3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.2, p. 40 (1978).\n\n\n15\n Moreover, unlike the seizure in Dunaway, which was designed to provide an opportunity for interrogation and did lead to Dunaway's confession, the seizure in this case is not likely to have coercive aspects likely to induce self-incrimination.\n\n\n16\n We do not view the fact that respondent was leaving his house when the officers arrived to be of constitutional significance.  The seizure of respondent on the sidewalk outside was no more intrusive than the detention of those residents of the house whom the police found inside.\n\n\n17\n The fact that our holding today deals with a case in which the police had a warrant does not, of course, preclude the possibility that comparable police conduct may be justified by exigent circumstances in the absence of a warrant.  No such question, however, is presented by this case.\n\n\n18\n Justice Jackson recognized the significance of this determination in Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 13-14, 68 S.Ct. 367, 368-369, 92 L.Ed. 436:\n\"The point of the Fourth Amendment, which often is not grasped by zealous officers, is not that it denies law enforcement the support of the usual inferences which reasonable men draw from evidence.  Its protection consists in requiring that those inferences be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.  Any assumption that evidence sufficient to support a magistrate's disinterested determination to issue a search warrant will justify the officers in making a search without a warrant would reduce the Amendment to a nullity and leave the people's homes secure only in the discretion of police officers.  Crime, even in the privacy of one's own quarters, is, of course, of grave concern to society, and the law allows such crime to be reached on proper showing.  The right of officers to thrust themselves into a home is also a grave concern, not only to the individual but to a society which chooses to dwell in reasonable security and freedom from surveillance.  When the right of privacy must reasonably yield to the right of search is, as a rule, to be decided by a judicial officer, not by a policeman or government enforcement agent.\"  (Footnotes omitted).\n\n\n19\n In refusing to approve seizures based on less than probable cause, the Dunaway Court declined to adopt a \"multifactor balancing test of 'reasonable police conduct under the circumstances' to cover all seizures that do not amount to technical arrests.\"  The Court noted:\n\"[T]he protections intended by the Framers could all too easily disappear in the consideration and balancing of the multifarious circumstances presented by different cases, especially when that balancing may be done in the first instance by police officers engaged in the 'often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.' \"  442 U.S., at 213, 99 S.Ct., at 2257.\nAs Justice WHITE noted in his concurrence in Dunaway, if police are to have workable rules, the balancing of the competing interests inherent in the Terry principle \"must in large part be done on a categorical basis\u2014not in an ad hoc, case-by-case fashion by individual police officers.\"  442 U.S., at 219-220, 99 S.Ct., at 2260.  The rule we adopt today does not depend upon such an ad hoc determination, because the officer is not required to evaluate either the quantum of proof justifying detention or the extent of the intrusion to be imposed by the seizure.\n\n\n20\n We do not decide whether the same result would be justified if the search warrant merely authorized a search for evidence.  Cf. Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, 436 U.S. 547, 560, 98 S.Ct. 1970, 1978, 56 L.Ed.2d 525.  See also id., at 581, 98 S.Ct., at 1989 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\n\n\n21\n Although special circumstances, or possibly a prolonged detention, might lead to a different conclusion in an unusual case, we are persuaded that this routine detention of residents of a house while it was being searched for contraband pursuant to a valid warrant is not such a case.\n\n\n1\n As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 702, the record in this case presents no evidence whatsoever that the police feared any threat to their safety or that of others from the conduct of the respondent, or that they could reasonably have so feared.  The Court says that this nevertheless was the \"kind of transaction that may give rise to sudden violence . . . .\"  Ibid.  But where the police cannot demonstrate, on the basis of specific and articulable facts, a reasonable belief that a person threatens physical harm to them or others, the speculation that other persons in that circumstance might pose such a threat cannot justify a search or seizure.   Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 92-93, 100 S.Ct. 338, 342-343, 62 L.Ed.2d 238.\n\n\n2\n In perplexing citation, the Court notes our holding in Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639, that an arrest warrant based on probable cause justifies entering a person's home to carry out the arrest, and declares that Payton \"is relevant today.\"  Ante, at 704.  But I had thought that the very point of the passage of the Court quotes from Payton, is that the police would be justified in arresting a person in his own home because they had a warrant for his arrest based upon probable cause to believe that he had violated the criminal law.  Since it is the absence of such probable cause that lies at the heart of this case, I fail to understand Payton's \"relevance.\"\n\n\n3\n The record does not clearly reveal the length of the search in this case.  In Harris v. United States, 331 U.S. 145, 67 S.Ct. 1098, 91 L.Ed. 1399, a Federal Bureau of Investigation search of a one-bedroom apartment for burglar tools and a pair of checks consumed five hours.  See also Stanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. 476, 477, 85 S.Ct. 506, 507, 13 L.Ed.2d 431.\n\n\n4\n I also question the Court's confident assertions about the inoffensive nature of the detention in this case.  First, the Court says the detention was innocuous because it was less intrusive than the search that was mandated by the warrant.  Ante, at 701.  This reasoning is, of course, circular, since the very question of the severity of the detention arises only because it was not based on a warrant or probable cause.\nSecond, the Court says that the intrusion was not a serious one because a reasonable-minded citizen would in fact want to be present at a search of his house unless he was fleeing to avoid arrest.  Ibid.  But I must infer that the respondent here did not want to be present in his house during the search, else he would not have brought this claim, and the law cannot penalize him for \"fleeing arrest\" when the police did not have probable cause to arrest him.  This second reason amounts to the view that a person cannot assert his rights under the exclusionary rule if he stands to benefit from the exclusion.\nFinally, the Court observes that this sort of detention is not likely to be exploited or unduly prolonged by the police, since the officers are more likely to find the information they seek through the search than through the detention.  Ibid.  I confess I do not understand this reason.  It seems no more than a restatement of the view that the police may detain the person to have him available for arrest when they complete the search, but that view merely begs the question whether the potential duration of the search threatens the person with a lengthy detention.\n\n\n5\n The Court adverts to this problem only by suggesting that \"special circumstances, or possibly a prolonged detention, might lead to a different conclusion in an unusual case.\"  Ante, at 705, n. 21.  But the Court provides no criteria for identifying \"special circumstances\" or for determining when a detention is \"prolonged\";  in particular, it fails to tell law enforcement officers whether a detention will always be permissible, however protracted, so as it does not exceed the length of the search of the house.  This ambiguity casts doubt on the Court's assertion, ante, at 705, n. 19, that its holding will not require individual police officers to engage in the sort of on-the-scene, ad hoc legal judgments which pose a serious threat to Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment protections.

{"text":"74 L.Ed.2d 12\n103 S.Ct. 281\n459 U.S. 14\nIMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICEv.Horacio Ramos MIRANDA.\nNo. 82-29.\nNov. 8, 1982.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nRespondent Horacio Miranda, a citizen of the Philippines, entered the United States in 1971 on a temporary visitor's visa. After his visa expired, he stayed in this country, eventually marrying Linda Milligan, a citizen of the United States, on May 26, 1976. Shortly thereafter, Milligan filed a visa petition with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) on respondent's behalf. She requested that he be granted an immigrant visa as her spouse.1 Respondent simultaneously filed an application requesting the INS to adjust his status to that of a permanent resident alien. Section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act conditions the granting of permanent resident status to an alien on the immediate availability of an immigrant visa.2 Milligan's petition, if approved, would have satisfied this condition.\n\n\n2\nThe INS did not act on either Milligan's petition or respondent's application for eighteen months. Following the breakup of her marriage with respondent, Milligan withdrew her petition in December 1977. At that point, the INS denied respondent's application for permanent residence because he had not shown that an immigrant visa was immediately available to him. The INS also issued an order to show cause why he should not be deported.\n\n\n3\nAt a deportation hearing, respondent conceded his deportability but renewed his application for permanent resident status because of his marriage to Milligan. Although the marriage had ended, he claimed that a previous marriage was sufficient to support his application. The immigration judge rejected this claim, concluding that the immediate availability of an immigrant visa was a necessary condition to respondent's application. Since Milligan had withdrawn her petition for an immigrant visa before the INS had acted on it, respondent was ineligible for permanent resident status.\n\n\n4\nRespondent appealed the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals. For the first time, he raised the claim that the INS was estopped from denying his application because of its \"unreasonable delay.\" He argued that the \"failure to act was not only unreasonable, unfair and unjust but also an abuse of governmental process if the delay was deliberate.\" Record 44. The Board rejected respondent's claim. It found \"no evidence of any 'affirmative misconduct' \" and no basis for an equitable estoppel. Record 4.\n\n\n5\nRespondent sought review of the Board's decision in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that \"(t)he unexplained failure of the INS to act on the visa petition for an eighteen-month period prior to the petitioner's withdrawal ... was affirmative misconduct by the INS.\" Miranda v. INS, 638 F.2d 83, 84 (CA9 1980). We granted certiorari, vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Schweiker v. Hansen, 450 U.S. 785, 101 S.Ct. 1468, 67 L.Ed.2d 685 (1981). See 454 U.S. 808, 102 S.Ct. 81, 70 L.Ed.2d 77 (1981).\n\n\n6\nOn remand, the Court of Appeals adhered to its earlier decision. 673 F.2d 1105 (CA9 1982) (per curiam). It found Hansen inapplicable for three reasons. First, the Government's conduct in Hansen had not risen to the level of affirmative misconduct. In this case, however, affirmative misconduct was established by the INS's unexplained delay in processing respondent's application. Second, although the private party in Hansen subsequently had been able to correct the Government's error, the INS's error here inflicted irrevocable harm on respondent. Finally, unlike the private party in Hansen who sought to recover from the public treasury, respondent was seeking only to become a permanent resident-a result that would entail no burden on the public fisc. The Court of Appeals determined \"that the Supreme Court's conclusion that the government was not estopped in Hansen neither compels nor suggests the same conclusion here.\" Id., at 1106.\n\n\n7\nIn Hansen, we did not consider whether estoppel will lie against the Government when there is evidence of affirmative misconduct. We found that a government official's misstatement to an applicant for federal insurance benefits, conceded to be less than affirmative misconduct, did not justify allowing the applicant to collect retroactive benefits from the public treasury. See 450 U.S., at 788-789, 101 S.Ct., at 1470-1471. Although Hansen involved estoppel in the context of a claim against the public treasury, we observed that \"(i)n two cases involving denial of citizenship, the Court has declined to decide whether even 'affirmative misconduct' would estop the Government from denying citizenship, for in neither case was 'affirmative misconduct' involved.\" Id., at 788, 101 S.Ct., at 1470.\n\n\n8\nThe Court of Appeals thus correctly considered whether, as an initial matter, there was a showing of affirmative misconduct. See INS v. Hibi, 414 U.S. 5, 8-9, 94 S.Ct. 19, 21-22, 38 L.Ed.2d 7 (1973) (per curiam); Montana v. Kennedy, 366 U.S. 308, 314-315, 81 S.Ct. 1336, 1340-1341, 6 L.Ed.2d 313 (1961). Hibi and Montana indicate, however, that the Court of Appeals erred in determining that the evidence in this case established affirmative misconduct. In Montana, a government official had incorrectly informed the petitioner's mother that she was unable to return to the United States because she was pregnant. The Court found that the official's misstatement \"falls far short of misconduct such as might prevent the United States from relying on petitioner's foreign birth\" as a basis for denying him citizenship. Id., at 314-315, 81 S.Ct., at 1340-1341. In Hibi, Congress had exempted aliens serving in the United States Armed Forces from certain requirements normally imposed on persons seeking naturalization. We found that neither the Government's failure to publicize fully the rights accorded by Congress nor its failure to make an authorized naturalization representative available to aliens serving outside of the United States estopped the Government from rejecting respondent's untimely application for naturalization. See 414 U.S., at 8-9, 94 S.Ct., at 21-22.\n\n\n9\nUnlike Montana and Hibi, where the Government's error was clear, the evidence that the Government failed to fulfill its duty in this case is at best questionable. The only indication of negligence is the length of time that the INS took to process respondent's application. Although the time was indeed long, we cannot say in the absence of evidence to the contrary that the delay was unwarranted.3 Cf. Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 415, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971) (presumption of regularity supports official act of public officer); United States v. Chemical Foundation, 272 U.S. 1, 14-15, 47 S.Ct. 1, 6, 71 L.Ed. 131 (1926) (same). Both the number of the applications received by the INS and the need to investigate their validity may make it difficult for the agency to process an application as promptly as may be desirable.4 Even if the INS arguably was negligent in not acting more expeditiously, its conduct was not significantly different from that in Montana and Hibi. Nor is the harm to respondent different. Montana and Hibi make clear that neither the Government's conduct nor the harm to the respondent is sufficient to estop the Government from enforcing the conditions imposed by Congress for residency in this country.\n\n\n10\nThe final distinction drawn by the Court of Appeals between this case and Hansen is unpersuasive. It is true that Hansen relied on a line of cases involving claims against the public treasury. But there was no indication that the Government would be estopped in the absence of the potential burden on the fisc. An increasingly important interest, implicating matters of broad public concern, is involved in cases of this kind. Enforcing the immigration laws, and the conditions for residency in this country, is becoming more difficult. See note 4, supra. Moreover, the INS is the agency primarily charged by Congress to implement the public policy underlying these laws. See, e.g., INS v. Wang, 450 U.S. 139, 144-145, 101 S.Ct. 1027, 1031, 67 L.Ed.2d 123 (1981) (per curiam); Hibi, supra, 414 U.S., at 8, 94 S.Ct., at 21. Appropriate deference must be accorded its decisions.\n\n\n11\nThis case does not require us to reach the question we reserved in Hibi, whether affirmative misconduct in a particular case would estop the Government from enforcing the immigration laws. Proof only that the Government failed to process promptly an application falls far short of establishing such conduct. Accordingly, we grant the petition for certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n12\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n13\nJustice MARSHALL, dissenting.\n\n\n14\nI dissent from the Court's summary reversal of the Court of Appeals. The Court concedes that the INS's 18-month delay in processing respondent's application \"was indeed long,\" but concludes that it \"cannot say in the absence of evidence to the contrary that the delay was unwarranted.\" Ante, at 18. The Court relies on a presumption of regularity which it says attends the official acts of public officers. Ibid. In view of the unusual delay in the processing of respondent's application, I do not agree that this case should be summarily disposed of on the basis of this convenient presumption. If the Court believes, as I do not, that this case raises an issue of sufficient importance to justify the exercise of our certiorari jurisdiction, and if the Court also believes that oral argument should be dispensed with, I would at least notify the parties that the Court is considering a summary disposition, so that they may have an opportunity to submit briefs on the merits.\n\n\n\n1\n Section 201(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as amended, provides for the admission of immigrants who are immediate relatives of United States citizens. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151(b).\n\n\n2\n Section 245(a) provides that the status of an alien who was admitted into the United States \"may be adjusted by the Attorney General, in his discretion and under such regulations as he may prescribe, to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if (1) the alien makes an application for such adjustment, (2) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence, and (3) an immigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time his application is filed.\" See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a).\n\n\n3\n The INS has maintained consistently that the eighteen-month delay was reasonable because of the need to investigate the validity of respondent's marriage. Because the issue of estoppel was raised initially on appeal, the parties were unable to develop any factual record on the issue.\n\n\n4\n In 1976, the year in which Milligan filed her petition on behalf of respondent, some 206,319 immediate relative petitions were filed. See 1976 Annual Report: Immigration and Naturalization Service 11. The Service has noted that \"(i)n dealing with these petitions, an inordinate amount of fraud, particularly in relation to claimed marriages, has been uncovered.... For a fee, partners are provided and marriages contracted to establish eligibility under the statutes for visa issuance benefits.\" Ibid. We cannot discount the need for careful investigation by the INS that these petitions demand.\n\n\n","label":1}

While respondent's subsequent appeal was pending in the Superior Court, where he had the right to a trial de novo, the prosecutor obtained an indictment covering the same conduct for the felony offense of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill and inflict serious bodily injury, to which respondent pleaded guilty. Thereafter, respondent applied for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court, claiming, inter alia, that the felony indictment deprived him of due process. The District Court granted the writ, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:\n1. The indictment on the felony charge contravened the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since a person convicted of a misdemeanor in North Carolina is entitled to pursue his right under state law to a trial de novo without apprehension that the State will retaliate by substituting a more serious charge for the original one and thus subject him to a significantly increased potential period of incarceration. Cf. North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656. Pp. 24\u201429.\n2. Since North Carolina, having chosen originally to proceed against respondent on the misdemeanor charge in the State District Court, was precluded by the Due Process Clause from even prosecuting respondent for the more serious charge in the Superior Court, respondent's guilty plea to the felony charge did not bar him from raising his constitutional claim in the federal habeas corpus proceeding. Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235, distinguished. Pp. 29\u201431.\nAffirmed.\nRichard N. League, Raleigh, N.C., for petitioners.\nJames E. Keenan, Durham, N.C., for respondent.\nMr. Justice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nWhile serving a term of imprisonment in a North Carolina penitentiary, the respondent Perry became involved in an altercation with another inmate. A warrant issued, charging Perry with the misdemeanor of assault with a deadly weapon, N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14\u201433(b)(1) (1969). Under North Carolina law, the District Court Division of the General Court of Justice has exclusive jurisdiction for the trial of misdemeanors. N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7A\u2014272. Following a trial without a jury in the District Court of Northampton County, Perry was convicted of this misdemeanor and given a six-month sentence, to be served after completion of the prison term he was then serving.\n\n\n2\nPerry then filed a notice of appeal to the Northampton County Superior Court. Under North Carolina law, a person convicted in the District Court has a right to a trial de novo in the Superior Court. N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 7A\u2014290, 15\u2014177.1. The right to trial de novo is absolute, there being no need for the appellant to allege error in the original proceeding. When an appeal is taken, the statutory scheme provides that the slate is wiped clean; the prior conviction is annulled, and the prosecution and the defense begin anew in the Superior Court.1\n\n\n3\nAfter the filing of the notice of appeal, but prior to the respondent's appearance for trial de novo in the Superior Court, the prosecutor obtained an indictment from a grand jury, charging Perry with the felony of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill and inflict serious bodily injury, N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14 32(a) (1969). The indictment covered the same conduct for which Perry had been tried and convicted in the District Court. Perry entered a plea of guilty to the indictment in the Superior Court, and was sentenced to a term of five to seven years in the penitentiary, to be served concurrently with the identical prison sentence he was then serving.2\n\n\n4\nA number of months later, the respondent filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. He claimed that the indictment on the felony charge in the Superior Court constituted double jeopardy and also deprived him of due process of law. In an unreported opinion, the District Court dismissed the petition for failure to exhaust available state remedies. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that resort to the state courts would be futile, because the Supreme Court of North Carolina had consistently rejected the constitutional claims presented by Perry in his petition. 453 F.2d 856.3 The case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.\n\n\n5\nOn remand, the District Court granted the writ. It held that the bringing of the felony charge after the filing of the appeal violated Perry's rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707. The District Court further held that the respondent had not, by his guilty plea in the Superior Court, waived his right to raise his constitutional claims in the federal habeas corpus proceeding. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in a brief per curiam opinion. We granted certiorari, 414 U.S. 908, 94 S.Ct. 218, 38 L.Ed.2d 145, to consider the seemingly important issues presented by this case.\n\n\n6\n* As in the District Court, Perry directs two independent constitutional attacks upon the conduct of the State in haling him into court on the felony charge after he took an appeal from the misdemeanor conviction. First, he contends that the felony indictment in the Superior Court placed him in double jeopardy, since he had already been convicted on the lesser included misdemeanor charge in the District Court. Second, he urges that the indictment on the felony charge constituted a penalty for his exercising his statutory right to appeal, and thus contravened the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.4 We find it necessary to reach only the latter claim.\n\n\n7\nPerry's due process arguments are derived substantially from North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656, and its progeny. In Pearce, the Court considered the constitutional problems presented when, following a successful appeal and reconviction, a criminal defendant was subjected to a greater punishment than that imposed at the first trial. While we concluded that such a harsher sentence was not absolutely precluded by either the Double Jeopardy or Due Process Clause, we emphasized that 'imposition of a penalty upon the defendant for having successfully pursued a statutory right of appeal or collateral remedy would be . . . a violation of due process of law.' Id., at 724, 89 S.Ct. at 2080. Because 'vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial,' id., at 725, 89 S.Ct. at 2080, we held that an increased sentence could not be imposed upon retrial unless the sentencing judge placed certain specified findings on the record.\n\n\n8\nIn Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U.S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 32 L.Ed.2d 584, the Court was called upon to decide the applicability of the Pearce holding to Kentucky's two-tiered system of criminal adjudication. Kentucky, like North Carolina, allows a misdemeanor defendant convicted in an inferior trial court to seek a trial de novo in a court of general jurisdiction.5 The appellant in Colten claimed that the Constitution prevented the court of general jurisdiction, after trial de novo, from imposing a sentence in excess of that imposed in the court of original trial. This Court rejected the Pearce analogy. Emphasizing that Pearce was directed at insuring the absence of 'vindictiveness' against a criminal defendant who attacked his initial conviction on appeal, the Court found such dangers greatly minimized on the facts presented in Colten. In contrast to Pearce, the court that imposed the increased sentence after retrial in Colten was not the one whose original judgment had prompted an appellate reversal; thus, there was little possibility that an increased sentence on trial de novo could have been motivated by personal vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing judge. Hence, the Court thought the prophylactic rule of Pearce unnecessary in the de novo trial and sentencing context of Colten.\n\n\n9\nThe Pearce decision was again interpreted by this Court last Term in Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U.S. 17, 93 S.Ct. 1977, 36 L.Ed.2d 714, in the setting of Georgia's system under which sentencing responsibility is entrusted to the jury. Upon retrial following the reversal of his original conviction, the defendant in Chaffin was reconvicted and sentenced to a greater term than had been imposed by the initial jury. Concentrating again on the issue of vindictiveness, the Court found no violation of the Pearce rule. It was noted that the second jury was completely unaware of the original sentence, and thus could hardly have sought to 'punish' Chaffin for his successful appeal. Moreover, the jury, unlike a judge who had been reversed on appeal, could hardly have a stake in the prior conviction or any motivation to discourage criminal defendants from seeking appellate review. Hence, it was concluded that the danger of vindictiveness under the circumstances of the case was 'de minimis,' id., 412 U.S. at 26, 93 S.Ct. at 1982, and did not require adoption of the constitutional rule set out in Pearce.\n\n\n10\nThe lesson that emerges from Pearce, Colten, and Chaffin is that the Due Process Clause is not offended by all possibilities of increased punishment upon retrial after appeal, but only by those that pose a realistic likelihood of 'vindictiveness.' Unlike the circumstances presented by those cases, however, in the situation here the central figure is not the judge or the jury, but the prosecutor. The question is whether the opportunities for vindictiveness in this situation are such as to impel the conclusion that due process of law requires a rule analogous to that of the Pearce case. We conclude that the answer must be in the affirmative.\n\n\n11\nA prosecutor clearly has a considerable stake in discouraging convicted misdemeanants from appealing and thus obtaining a trial de novo in the Superior Court, since such an appeal will clearly require increased expenditures of prosecutorial resources before the defendant's conviction becomes final, and may even result in a formerly convicted defendant's going free. And, if the prosecutor has the means readily at hand to discourage such appeals\u2014by 'upping the ante' through a felony indictment whenever a convicted misdemeant pursues his statutory appellate remedy\u2014the State can insure that only the most hardy defendants will brave the hazards of a de novo trial.\n\n\n12\nThere is, of course, no evidence that the prosecutor in this case acted in bad faith or maliciously in seeking a felony indictment against Perry. The rationale of our judgment in the Pearce case, however, was not grounded upon the proposition that actual retaliatory motivation must inevitably exist. Rather, we emphasized that 'since the fear of such vindictiveness may unconstitutionally deter a defendant's exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his first conviction, due process also requires that a defendant be freed of apprehension of such a retaliatory motivation on the part of the sentencing judge.' 395 U.S., at 725, 89 S.Ct. at 2080. We think it clear that the same considerations apply here. A person convicted of an offense is entitled to pursue his statutory right to a trial de novo, without apprehension that the State will retaliate by substituting a more serious charge for the original one, thus subjecting him to a significantly increased potential period of incarceration.6 Cf. United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570, 88 S.Ct. 1209, 20 L.Ed.2d 138.\n\n\n13\nDue process of law requires that such a potential for vindictiveness must not enter into North Carolina's two-tiered appellate process. We hold, therefore, that it was not constitutionally permissible for the State to respond to Perry's invocation of his statutory right to appeal by bringing a more serious charge against him prior to the trial de novo.7\n\nII\n\n14\nThe remaining question is whether, because of his guilty plea to the felony charge in the Superior Court, Perry is precluded from raising his constitutional claims in this federal habeas corpus proceeding. In contending that such is the case, petitioners rely chiefly on this Court's decision last Term in Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235.\n\n\n15\nThe precise issue presented in Tollett was 'whether a state prisoner, pleading guilty with the advice of counsel, may later obtain release through federal habeas corpus by proving only that the indictment to which he pleaded was returned by an unconstitutionally selected grand jury.' Id., at 260, 93 S.Ct. at 1604. The Court answered that question in the negative. Relying primarily on the guilty-plea trilogy of Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747; McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763, and Parker v. North Carolina, 397 U.S. 790, 90 S.Ct. 1458, 25 L.Ed.2d 785, the Court characterized the guilty plea as 'a break in the chain of events which has preceded it in the criminal process.' Id., 411 U.S., at 267, 93 S.Ct., at 1608. Accordingly, the Court held that when a criminal defendant enters a guilty plea, 'he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.' Ibid. Rather, a person complaining of such 'antecedent constitutional violations,' Id., 411 U.S. at 266, 93 S.Ct. at 1607, is limited in a federal habeas corpus proceeding to attacks on the voluntary and intelligent nature of the guilty plea, through proof that the advice received from counsel was not 'within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.' See McMann, supra, 397 U.S. at 771, 90 S.Ct. at 1449.\n\n\n16\nWhile petitioners' reliance upon the Tollett opinion is understandable, there is a fundamental distinction between this case and that one. Although the underlying claims presented in Tollett and the Brady trilogy were of constitutional dimension, none went to the very power of the State to bring the defendant into court to answer the charge brought against him. The defendants in McMann v. Richardson, for example, could surely have been brought to trial without the use of the allegedly coerced confessions, and even a tainted indictment of the sort alleged in Tollett could have been 'cured' through a new indictment by a properly selected grand jury. In the case at hand, by contrast, the nature of the underlying constitutional infirmity is markedly different. Having chosen originally to proceed on the misdemeanor charge in the District Court, the State of North Carolina was, under the facts of this case, simply precluded by the Due Process Clause from calling upon the respondent to answer to the more serious charge in the Superior Court. Unlike the defendant in Tollett, Perry is not complaining of 'antecedent constitutional violations' or of a 'deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.' 411 U.S., at 266, 267, 93 S.Ct., at 1607, 1608. Rather, the right that he asserts and that we today accept is the right not to be haled into court at all upon the felony charge. The very initiation of the proceedings against him in the Superior Court thus operated to deny him due process of law.\n\n\n17\nLast Term in Robinson v. Neil, 409 U.S. 505, 93 S.Ct. 876, 35 L.Ed.2d 29, in explaining why the Double Jeopardy Clause is distinctive, the Court noted that 'its practical result is to prevent a trial from taking place at all, rather than to prescribe procedural rules that govern the conduct of a trial.' Id., at 509, 93 S.Ct., at 878. While our judgment today is not based upon the Double Jeopardy Clause, we think that the quoted language aptly describes the due process right upon which our judgment is based. The 'practical result' dictated by the Due Process Clause in this case is that North Carolina simply could not permissibly require Perry to answer to the felony charge. That being so, it follows that his guilty plea did not foreclose him from attacking his conviction in the Superior Court proceedings through a federal writ of habeas corpus.8\n\n\n18\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is affirmed.\n\n\n19\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n20\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting.\n\n\n21\nI would find it more difficult than the Court apparently does in Part I of its opinion to conclude that the very bringing of more serious charges against respondent following his request for a trial de novo violated due process as defined in North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969). Still more importantly, I believe the Court's conclusion that respondent may assert the Court's new-found Pearce claim in this federal habeas action, despite his plea of guilty to the charges brought after his invocation of his statutory right to a trial de novo, marks an unwarranted departure from the principles we have recently enunciated in Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973), and the Brady trilogy, Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970); McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970); and Parker v. North Carolina, 397 U.S. 790, 90 S.Ct. 1458, 25 L.Ed.2d 785 (1970).\n\n\n22\n* As the Court notes, in addition to his claim based on Pearce, respondent contends that his felony indictment in the Superior Court violated his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969). Presumably because we have earlier held that 'the jeopardy incident to' a trial does 'not extent to an offense beyond (the trial court's) jurisdiction,' Diaz v. United States, 223 U.S. 442, 449, 32 S.Ct. 250, 251, 56 L.Ed. 500 (1912), the Court rests its decision instead on the Fourteenth Amendment due process doctrine of Pearce. In so doing, I think the Court too readily equates the role of the prosecutor, who is a natural adversary of the defendant and who, we observed in Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U.S. 17, 27 n. 13, 93 S.Ct. 1977, 1983, 36 L.Ed.2d 714 (1973), 'often request(s) more than (he) can reasonably expect to get,' with that of the sentencing judge in Pearce. I also think the Court passes too lightly over the reasoning of Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U.S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 32 L.Ed.2d 584 (1972), in which we held that imposition of the prophylactic rule of Pearce was not necessary in Kentucky's two-tier system for de novo appeals from justice court convictions, even though the judge at retrial might impose a more severe sentence than had been imposed by the justice court after the original trial.\n\n\n23\nThe concurring opinion in Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 726, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2081, 23 L.Ed.2d 656, took the position that the imposition of a penalty after retrial which exceeded the penalty imposed after the first trial violated the guarantee against double jeopardy. But the opinion of the Court, relying on cases such as United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 41 L.Ed. 300 (1896), and Stroud v. United States, 251 U.S. 15, 40 S.Ct. 50, 64 L.Ed. 103 (1919), specifically rejected such an approach to the case. The Court went on to hold 'that neither the double jeopardy provision nor the Equal Protection Clause imposes an absolute bar to a more severe sentence upon reconviction.' 395 U.S., at 723, 89 S.Ct., at 2079. The Court concluded by holding that due process crequires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial. And since the fear of such vindictiveness may unconstitutionally deter a defendant's exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his first conviction, due process also requires that a defendant be freed of apprehension of such a retaliatory motivation on the part of the sentencing judge.' Id., at 725, 89 S.Ct., at 2080. To make certain that those requirements of due process were met, the Court laid down the rule that 'whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for his doing so must affirmatively appear.' Id., at 726, 89 S.Ct., at 2081. Thus the avowed purpose of the remedy fashioned in Pearce was to prevent judicial vindictiveness from resulting in longer sentences after a retrial following successful appeal.\n\n\n24\nSince in theory if not in practice the second sentence in the Pearce situation might be expected to be the same as the first unless influenced by vindictiveness or by intervening conduct of the defendant, in theory at least the remedy mandated there reached no further than the identified wrong. The same cannot be said here. For while indictment on more serious charges after a successful appeal would present a problem closely analogous to that in Pearce in this respect, the bringing of more serious charges after a defendant's exercise of his absolute right to a trial de novo in North Carolina's two-tier system does not. The prosecutor here elected to proceed initially in the State District Court where felony charges could not be prosecuted, for reasons which may well have been unrelated to whether he believed respondent was guilty of and could be convicted of the felony with which he was later charged. Both prosecutor and defendant stand to benefit from an initial prosecution in the District Court, the prosecutor at least from its less burdensome procedures and the defendant from the opportunity for an initial acquittal and the limited penalties. With the countervailing reasons for proceeding only on the misdemeanor charge in the District Court no longer applicable once the defendant has invoked his statutory right to a trial de novo, a prosecutor need not be vindictive to seek to indict and convict a defendant of the more serious of the two crimes of which he believes him guilty. Thus even if one accepts the Court's equation of prosecutorial vindictiveness with judicial vindictiveness, here, unlike Pearce, the Court's remedy reaches far beyond the wrong it identifies.\n\n\n25\nIndeed, it is not a little puzzling that the Court's remedy is the same that would follow upon a conclusion that the bringing of the new charges violated respondent's rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause. And the Court's conclusion that '(t)he very initiation of the proceedings against (respondent) in the Superior Court thus operated to deny him due process of law' surely sounds in the language of double jeopardy, however, it may be dressed in due process garb.\n\nII\n\n26\nIf the Court is correct in stating the consequences of upholding respondent's constitutional claim here, and indeed the State lacked the very power to bring him to trial, I believe this case is governed by cases culminating in Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973). In that case the State no doubt lacked 'power' to bring Henderson to trial without a valid grand jury indictment; yet that constitutional disability was held by us to be merged in the guilty plea. I do not see why a constitutional claim the consequences of which make it the identical twin of double jeopardy may not, like double jeopardy, be waived by the person for whose benefit it is accorded. Kepner v. United States, 195 U.S. 100, 131, 24 S.Ct. 797, 805, 49 L.Ed. 114 (1904); Harris v. United States, 237 F.2d 274, 277 (CA8 1956); Kistner v. United States, 332 F.2d 978, 980 (CA8 1964).\n\n\n27\nIn Tollett v. Henderson, supra, we held that 'just as the guilty pleas in the Brady trilogy were found to foreclose direct inquiry into the merits of claimed antecedent constitutional violations there . . . respondent's guilty plea here alike forecloses independent inquiry into the claim of discrimination in the selection of the grand jury.' 411 U.S., at 266, 93 S.Ct., at 1607. Surely the due process violation found by the Court today is no less 'antecedent' than the constitutional violations claimed to make the grand jury indictment invalid in Tollett v. Henderson, the confession inadmissible in McMann, or the exercise of the right to a jury trial impermissibly burdened in Brady and Parker. As the Court notes, we reaffirmed in Tollett v. Henderson the principle of the Brady trilogy that 'a guilty plea represents a break in the chain of events which has preceded it in the criminal process.' 411 U.S., at 267, 93 S.Ct., at 1608. We went on to say there:\n\n\n28\n'When a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open      court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he      is charged, he may not thereafter raise independent claims      relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that      occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea. He may only      attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the guilty      plea by showing that the advice he received from counsel was      not within the standards set forth in McMann.' Ibid.\n\n\n29\nThe assertion by the Court that this reasoning is somehow inapplicable here because the claim goes 'to the very power of the State to bring the defendant into court to answer the charge brought against him' is little other than a conclusion. Any difference between the issue resolved the other way in Tollett v. Henderson and the issue before us today is at most semantic. But the Court's 'test' not only fails to distinguish Henderson; it also fails to provide any reasoned basis on which to approach such questions as whether a speedy trial claim is merged in a guilty plea. I believe the Court's departure today from the principles of Henderson and the cases preceding it must be recognized as a potentially major breach in the wall of certainty surrounding guilty pleas for which we have found constitutional sanction in those cases.\n\n\n30\nThere is no indication in this record that respondent's guilty plea was the result of an agreement with the prosecutor. But the Court's basis for distinguishing the Henderson and Brady cases seems so insubstantial as to permit the doctrine of this case to apply to guilty pleas which have been obtained as a result of 'plea bargains.' In that event it will be not merely the State which stands to lose, but the accused defendant in the position of the respondent as well. Since the great majority of criminal cases are resolved by plea bargaining, defendants as a class have at least as great an interest in the finality of voluntary guilty pleas as do prosecutors. If that finality may be swept aside with the ease exhibited by the Court's approach today, prosecutors will have a reduced incentive to bargain, to the detriment of the many defendants for whom plea bargaining offers the only hope for ameliorating the consequences to them of a serious criminal charge.\n\nIII\n\n31\nBut, if, as I believe, a proper analysis of respondent's constitutional claim produces at most a violation of the standards laid down in North Carolina v. Pearce, supra, I agree with the Court, though not for the reasons it gives, that respondent's claim was not merged in his guilty plea. Imposition of sentence in violation of Pearce is not an 'antecedent constitutional violation,' since sentence is customarily imposed after a plea of guilty, and is a separate legal event from the determination by the Court that the defendant is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged.\n\n\n32\nIf respondent's claim is properly analyzed in terms of Pearce, I would think that a result quite different from that mandated in the Court's opinion would obtain. Pearce and the decisions following it have made it clear that the wrong lies in the increased sentence, not in the judgment of conviction, and that the remedy for a Pearce defect is a remand for sentencing consistent with due process. North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244, 247\u2014248, 92 S.Ct. 402, 404, 30 L.Ed.2d 413 (1971). In Rice we concluded that the Court of Appeals had erred in ruling that Pearce authorized the expunging of Rice's conviction after his trial de novo in North Carolina:\n\n\n33\n'It could not be clearer . . . that Pearce does not      invalidate the conviction that resulted from Rice's second      trial . . .. Pearce, in short, requires only resentencing;      the conviction is not ipso facto set aside and a new trial      required. Even if the higher sentence imposed after Rice's      trial de novo was vulnerable under Pearce, Rice was entitled      neither to have his conviction erased nor to avoid the      collateral consequences flowing from that conviction and a      proper sentence.' Ibid.\n\n\n34\nSince Rice had completely served his sentence, rather than reaching the merits of Rice's Pearce claim, we remanded for a determination whether any collateral consequences flowed from his service of the longer sentence imposed after retrial, or whether the case was moot.\n\n\n35\nHere, while respondent faced the prospect of a more severe sentence at the conclusion of his felony trial in the Superior Court of North Carolina, it was by no means self-evident that this would be the result. The maximum sentence which he could receive on the misdemeanor court was one and one-half years, but nothing in the record indicates that the Superior Court judge might not impose a lesser penalty than that, or even grant probation. Nor is there any indication in the habeas record, which contains only a fragment of the state court proceedings, that the Superior Court judge might not at the conclusion of the trial and after a verdict of guilty have before him for sentencing purposes information which would support an augmented sentence under Pearce. In fact, the habeas court found that the sentence actually imposed was more severe than that which could have been imposed under the misdemeanor charge. But the remedy for that violation should be a direction to the state court to resentence in accordance with Pearce, rather than an order completely annulling the conviction. Respondent was originally convicted of assaulting a fellow inmate with a deadly weapon, and later pleaded guilty to a charge of assaulting the inmate with a deadly weapon with intent to kill him. But in spite of both a verdict of guilty on one charge and a plea of guilty to the other, the Court's decision may well, as a practical matter, assure that no penalty whatever will be imposed on him.\n\n\n36\nMr. Justice POWELL joins in Part II of this opinion.\n\n\n\n1\n See generally State v. Spencer, 276 N.C. 535, 173 S.E.2d 765; State v. Sparrow, 276 N.C. 499, 173 S.E.2d 897.\n\n\n2\n The respondent's guilty plea was apparently premised on the expectation that any sentence he received in the Superior Court would be served concurrently with the sentence he was then serving, as contrasted with the consecutive sentence imposed in the District Court. That expectation was fulfilled, but it turned out that the guilty plea resulted in increasing the respondent's potential term of incarceration. Under applicable North Carolina law, the five- to seven-year assault sentence did not commence until the date of the guilty plea, October 29, 1969. By that time, Perry had already served some 17 months of the sentence he was serving at the time of the five- to seven-year Thus, the effect of the five- to seven-year concurrent sentence on the assault charge was to increase his potential period of confinement by these 17 months, as opposed to the six-month increase envisaged by the District Court's consecutive sentence.\n\n\n3\n The Court of Appeals further instructed the District Court to await the ruling of this Court in Rice v. North Carolina, 434 F.2d 297 (CA4), cert. granted, 401 U.S. 1008, 91 S.Ct. 1256, 28 L.Ed.2d 544. Rice involved a challenge to the constitutionality of an enhanced penalty received after a criminal defendant had sought a trial de novo under North Carolina's two-tiered misdemeanor adjudication system. This Court did not reach the merits of this issue in Rice, instead vacating and remanding to the Court of Appeals for consideration as to whether the case had become moot. 404 U.S. 244, 92 S.Ct. 402, 30 L.Ed.2d 413.\nSubsequently, in Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U.S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 32 L.Ed.2d 584, we dealt with the merits of this issue, and held that the imposition of an increased sentence on trial de novo did not violate either the Due Process or the Double Jeopardy Clause. The District Court in the present case had the benefit of the Colten decision before issuing its opinion granting habeas corpus relief.\n\n\n4\n This Court has never held that the States are constitutionally required to establish avenues of appellate review of criminal convictions. Nonetheless, 'it is now fundamental that, once established, these avenues must be kept free of unreasoned distinctions that can only impede open and equal access to the courts.' Rinaldi v. Yeager, 384 U.S. 305, 310, 86 S.Ct. 1497, 1500, 16 L.Ed.2d 577. See also Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891; Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811; Lane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477, 83 S.Ct. 768, 9 L.Ed.2d 892; Draper v. Washington, 372 U.S. 487, 83 S.Ct. 774, 9 L.Ed.2d 899; North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 724 725, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2080, 23 L.Ed.2d 656; Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U.S. 17, 24 n. 11, 93 S.Ct. 1977, 1981, 36 L.Ed.2d 714.\n\n\n5\n For a more exhaustive list of States employing similar two-tiered procedures, see Colten, supra, 407 U.S. at 112 n. 4, 92 S.Ct. at 1958.\n\n\n6\n Moreover, even putting to one side the potentiality of increased incarceration, conviction of a 'felony' often entails more serious collateral consequences than those incurred through a misdemeanor conviction. See generally Special Project, The Collateral Consequences of a Criminal Conviction, 23 Vand.L.Rev. 929, 955\u2014960; Note, Civil Disabilities of Felons, 53 Va.L.Rev. 403, 406\u2014408. Cf. O'Brien v. Skinner, 414 U.S. 524, 94 S.Ct. 740, 38 L.Ed.2d 702 (involving New York law under which convicted misdemeanants retain the right to vote).\n\n\n7\n This would clearly be a different case if the State had shown that it was impossible to proceed on the more serious charge at the outset, as in Diaz v. United States, 223 U.S. 442, 32 S.Ct. 250, 56 L.Ed. 500. In that case the defendant was originally tried and convicted for assault and battery. Subsequent to the original trial, the assault victim died, and the defendant was then tried and convicted for homicide. Obviously, it would not have been possible for the authorities in Diaz to have originally proceeded against the defendant on the more serious charge, since the crime of homicide was not complete until after the victim's death.\n\n\n8\n Contrary to the dissenting opinion, our decision today does not 'assure that no penalty whatever will be imposed' on respondent. Post, at 39. While the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment bars trial of Perry on the felony assault charges in the Superior Court, North Carolina is wholly free to conduct a trial de novo in the Superior Court on the original misdemeanor assault charge. Indeed, this is precisely the course that Perry has invited, by filing an appeal from the original judgment of the District Court.\nThe dissenting opinion also seems to misconceive the nature of the due process right at stake here. If this were a case involving simply an increased sentence violative of the Pearce rule, a remand for resentencing would be in order. Our holding today, however, is not that Perry was denied due process by the length of the sentence imposed by the Superior Court, but rather by the very institution of the felony indictment against him. While we reach this conclusion in partial reliance on the analogy of Pearce and its progeny, the due process violation here is not the same as was involved in those cases, and cannot be remedied solely through a resentencing procedure in the Superior Court. Cf. n. 6, supra.\n\n\n","label":0}

Beyond an investigative report made a month after the crimes were committed, little additional information was developed in the following 17 months. Claiming that the preindictment delay, during which material defense testimony had been lost, deprived him of due process, respondent moved to dismiss the indictment. The District Court, which found that the delay had not been explained or justified and was unnecessary and prejudicial to respondent, granted the motion to dismiss. The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the delay, which it found was solely attributable to the Government's hope that other participants in the crime would be discovered, was unjustified. Held : The Court of Appeals erred in affirming the District Court's dismissal of the indictment. Pp. 788-797.\n(a) Although the Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment is applicable only after a person has been accused of a crime and statutes of limitations provide \" 'the primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges,' \" United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 322, 92 S.Ct. 455, 464, 30 L.Ed.2d 468, those statutes do not fully define a defendant's rights with respect to events antedating the indictment, and the Due Process Clause has a limited role to play in protecting against oppressive delay. Pp. 788-789.\n(b) While proof of prejudice makes a due process claim ripe for adjudication, it does not automatically validate such a claim, and the reasons for the delay must also be considered. Pp. 789-790.\n(c) To prosecute a defendant following good-faith investigative delay, as apparently existed in this case, does not deprive him of due process even if his defense might have been somewhat prejudiced by the lapse of time. Prosecutors are under no duty to file charges as soon as probable cause exists but before they are satisfied that they will be able to establish a suspect's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Nor is there a constitutional requirement that charges must be filed after there is sufficient evidence to prove such guilt but before the investigation is complete. An immediate arrest or indictment might impair the prosecutors' ability to continue the investigation or obtain additional indictments, would pressure prosecutors into resolving doubtful cases in favor of early (and possibly unwarranted) prosecutions, and would preclude full consideration of the desirability of not prosecuting in particular cases. Pp. 790-796.\n8 Cir., 532 F.2d 59, reversed.\nLouis Gilden, St. Louis, for the respondent.\nJohn P. Rupp, Washington, D. C., for the petitioner.\nMr. Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nWe granted certiorari in this case to consider the circumstances in which the Constitution requires that an indictment be dismissed because of delay between the commission of an offense and the initiation of prosecution.\n\n\n2\n* On March 6, 1975, respondent was indicted for possessing eight firearms stolen from the United States mails, and for dealing in firearms without a license. The offenses were alleged to have occurred between July 25 and August 31, 1973, more than 18 months before the indictment was filed. Respondent moved to dismiss the indictment due to the delay.\n\n\n3\nThe District Court conducted a hearing on respondent's motion at which the respondent sought to prove that the delay was unnecessary and that it had prejudiced his defense. In an effort to establish the former proposition, respondent presented a Postal Inspector's report on his investigation that was prepared one month after the crimes were committed, and a stipulation concerning the post-report progress of the probe. The report stated, in brief, that within the first month of the investigation respondent had admitted to Government agents that he had possessed and then sold five of the stolen guns, and that the agents had developed strong evidence linking respondent to the remaining three weapons.1 The report also stated, however, that the agents had been unable to confirm or refute respondent's claim that he had found the guns in his car when he returned to it after visiting his son, a mail handler, at work.2 The stipulation into which the Assistant United States Attorney entered indicated that little additional information concerning the crimes was uncovered in the 17 months following the preparation of the Inspector's report.3\n\n\n4\nTo establish prejudice to the defense, respondent testified that he had lost the testimony of two material witnesses due to the delay. The first witness, Tom Stewart, died more than a year after the alleged crimes occurred. At the hearing respondent claimed that Stewart had been his source for two or three of the guns. The second witness, respondent's brother, died in April 1974, eight months after the crimes were completed. Respondent testified that his brother was present when respondent called Stewart to secure the guns, and witnessed all of respondent's sales. Respondent did not state how the witnesses would have aided the defense had they been willing to testify.4\n\n\n5\nThe Government made no systematic effort in the District Court to explain its long delay. The Assistant United States Attorney did expressly disagree, however, with defense counsel's suggestion that the investigation had ended after the Postal Inspector's report was prepared. App. 9-10. The prosecutor also stated that it was the Government's theory that respondent's son, who had access to the mail at the railroad terminal from which the guns were \"possibly stolen,\" id., at 17, was responsible for the thefts, id., at 13.5 Finally, the prosecutor elicited somewhat cryptic testimony from the Postal Inspector indicating that the case \"as to these particular weapons involves other individuals\"; that information had been presented to a grand jury \"in regard to this case other than . . . (on) the day of the indictment itself\"; and that he had spoken to the prosecutors about the case on four or five occasions. Id., at 20.\n\n\n6\nFollowing the hearing, the District Court filed a brief opinion and order. The court found that by October 2, 1973, the date of the Postal Inspector's report, \"the Government had all the information relating to defendant's alleged commission of the offenses charged against him,\" and that the 17-month delay before the case was presented to the grand jury \"had not been explained or justified\" and was \"unnecessary and unreasonable.\" The court also found that \"(a)s a result of the delay defendant has been prejudiced by reason of the death of Tom Stewart, a material witness on his behalf.\" Pet. for Cert. 14a. Accordingly, the court dismissed the indictment.\n\n\n7\n(1) The Government appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. In its brief the Government explained the months of inaction by stating:\n\n\n8\n\"(T)here was a legitimate Government interest in keeping the      investigation open in the instant case. The defendant's son      worked for the Terminal Railroad and had access to mail. It      was the Government's position that the son was responsible      for the theft and therefore further investigation to      establish this fact was important.\n\n\n9\n\". . . Although the investigation did not continue on a full      time basis, there was contact between the United States      Attorney's office and the Postal Inspector's office      throughout . . . and certain matters were brought before a      Federal Grand Jury prior to the determination that the case      should be presented for indictment . . . .\" Brief for United      States in No. 75-1852 (CA8), pp. 5-6.\n\n\n10\nThe Court of Appeals accepted the Government's representation as to the motivation for the delay, but a majority of the court nevertheless affirmed the District Court's finding that the Government's actions were \"unjustified, unnecessary, and unreasonable.\" 532 F.2d 59, 61 (1976). The majority also found that respondent had established that his defense had been impaired by the loss of Stewart's testimony because it understood respondent to contend that \"were Stewart's testimony available it would support (respondent's) claim that he did not know that the guns were stolen from the United States mails.\" Ibid. The court therefore affirmed the District Court's dismissal of the three possession counts by a divided vote.6\n\n\n11\nWe granted certiorari, 429 U.S. 884, 97 S.Ct. 233, 50 L.Ed.2d 164, and now reverse.7\n\nII\n\n12\n(2, 3) In United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971), this Court considered the significance, for constitutional purposes, of a lengthy preindictment delay. We held that as far as the Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment is concerned, such delay is wholly irrelevant, since our analysis of the language, history, and purposes of the Clause persuaded us that only \"a formal indictment or information or else the actual restraints imposed by arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge . . . engage the particular protections\" of that provision. Id., at 320, 92 S.Ct., at 463.8 We went on to note that statutes of limitations, which provide predictable, legislatively enacted limits on prosecutorial delay, provide \" 'the primary guarantee, against bringing overly stale criminal charges.' \" Id., at 322, 92 S.Ct., at 464, quoting United States v. Ewell, 383 U.S. 116, 122, 86 S.Ct. 773, 777, 15 L.Ed.2d 627 (1966). But we did acknowledge that the \"statute of limitations does not fully define (defendants') rights with respect to the events occurring prior to indictment,\" 404 U.S., at 324, 92 S.Ct., at 465, and that the Due Process Clause has a limited role to play in protecting against oppressive delay.\n\n\n13\n(4) Respondent seems to argue that due process bars prosecution whenever a defendant suffers prejudice as a result of preindictment delay. To support that proposition respondent relies on the concluding sentence of the Court's opinion in Marion where, in remanding the case, we stated that \"(e)vents of the trial may demonstrate actual prejudice, but at the present time appellees' due process claims are speculative and premature.\" Id., at 326, 92 S.Ct., at 466. But the quoted sentence establishes only that proof of actual prejudice makes a due process claim concrete and ripe for adjudication, not that it makes the claim automatically valid. Indeed, two pages earlier in the opinion we expressly rejected the argument respondent advances here:\n\n\n14\n\"(W)e need not . . . determine when and in what circumstances      actual prejudice resulting from preaccusation delays requires      the dismissal of the prosecution. Actual prejudice to the defense of a criminal case may result from      the shortest and most necessary delay; and no one suggests      that every delay-caused detriment to a defendant's case      should abort a criminal prosecution.\" Id., at 324-325, 92      S.Ct., at 465. (Footnotes omitted.)\n\n\n15\nThus Marion makes clear that proof of prejudice is generally a necessary but not sufficient element of a due process claim, and that the due process inquiry must consider the reasons for the delay as well as the prejudice to the accused.\n\n\n16\n(5, 6) The Court of Appeals found that the sole reason for the delay here was \"a hope on the part of the Government that others might be discovered who may have participated in the theft . . . .\" 532 F.2d, at 61. It concluded that this hope did not justify the delay, and therefore affirmed the dismissal of the indictment. But the Due Process Clause does not permit courts to abort criminal prosecutions simply because they disagree with a prosecutor's judgment as to when to seek an indictment. Judges are not free, in defining \"due process,\" to impose on law enforcement officials our \"personal and private notions\" of fairness and to \"disregard the limits that bind judges in their judicial function.\" Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 170, 72 S.Ct. 205, 209, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952). Our task is more circumscribed. We are to determine only whether the action complained of here, compelling respondent to stand trial after the Government delayed indictment to investigate further violates those \"fundamental conceptions of justice which lie at the base of our civil and political institutions,\" Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103, 112, 55 S.Ct. 340, 342, 79 L.Ed. 791 (1935), and which define \"the community's sense of fair play and decency,\" Rochin v. California, supra, 342 U.S., at 173, 72 S.Ct. at 210. See also Ham v. South Carolina, 409 U.S. 524, 526, 93 S.Ct. 848, 850, 35 L.Ed.2d 46 (1973); Lisenba v. California, 314 U.S. 219, 236, 62 S.Ct. 280, 289, 86 L.Ed. 166 (1941); Hebert v. Louisiana, 272 U.S. 312, 316, 47 S.Ct. 103, 104, 71 L.Ed. 270 (1926); Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516, 535, 4 S.Ct. 111, 120, 28 L.Ed. 232 (1884).\n\n\n17\n(7) It requires no extended argument to establish that prosecutors do not deviate from \"fundamental conceptions of justice\" when they defer seeking indictments until they have probable cause to believe an accused is guilty; indeed it is unprofessional conduct for a prosecutor to recommend an indictment on less than probable cause.9 It should be equally obvious that prosecutors are under no duty to file charges as soon as probable cause exists but before they are satisfied they will be able to establish the suspect's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. To impose such a duty \"would have a deleterious effect both upon the rights of the accused and upon the ability of society to protect itself,\" United States v. Ewell, supra, 383 U.S., at 120, 86 S.Ct., at 776. From the perspective of potential defendants, requiring prosecutions to commence when probable cause is established is undesirable because it would increase the likelihood of unwarranted charges being filed, and would add to the time during which defendants stand accused but untried.10 These costs are by no means insubstantial since, as we recognized in Marion, a formal accusation may \"interfere with the defendant's liberty, . . . disrupt his employment, drain his financial resources, curtail his associations, subject him to public obloquy, and create anxiety in him, his family and his friends.\" 404 U.S., at 320, 92 S.Ct., at 463. From the perspective of law enforcement officials, a requirement of immediate prosecution upon probable cause is equally unacceptable because it could make obtaining proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt impossible by causing potentially fruitful sources of information to evaporate before they are fully exploited.11 And from the standpoint of the courts, such a requirement is unwise because it would cause scarce resources to be consumed on cases that prove to be insubstantial, or that involve only some of the responsible parties or some of the criminal acts.12 Thus, no one's interests would be well served by compelling prosecutors to initiate prosecutions as soon as they are legally entitled to do so.13\n\n\n18\n(8) It might be argued that once the Government has assembled sufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, it should be constitutionally required to file charges promptly, even if its investigation of the entire criminal transaction is not complete. Adopting such a rule, however, would have many of the same consequences as adopting a rule requiring immediate prosecution upon probable cause.\n\n\n19\nFirst, compelling a prosecutor to file public charges as soon as the requisite proof has been developed against one participant on one charge would cause numerous problems in those cases in which a criminal transaction involves more than one person or more than one illegal act. In some instances, an immediate arrest or indictment would impair the prosecutor's ability to continue his investigation, thereby preventing society from bringing lawbreakers to justice. In other cases, the prosecutor would be able to obtain additional indictments despite an early prosecution, but the necessary result would be multiple trials involving a single set of facts. Such trials place needless burdens on defendants, law enforcement officials, and courts.\n\n\n20\nSecond, insisting on immediate prosecution once sufficient evidence is developed to obtain a conviction would pressure prosecutors into resolving doubtful cases in favor of early and possibly unwarranted prosecutions. The determination of when the evidence available to the prosecution is sufficient to obtain a conviction is seldom clear-cut, and reasonable persons often will reach conflicting conclusions. In the instant case, for example, since respondent admitted possessing at least five of the firearms, the primary factual issue in dispute was whether respondent knew the guns were stolen as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708. Not surprisingly, the Postal Inspector's report contained no direct evidence bearing on this issue. The decision whether to prosecute, therefore, required a necessarily subjective evaluation of the strength of the circumstantial evidence available and the credibility of respondent's denial. Even if a prosecutor concluded that the case was weak and further investigation appropriate, he would have no assurance that a reviewing court would agree. To avoid the risk that a subsequent indictment would be dismissed for preindictment delay, the prosecutor might feel constrained to file premature charges, with all the disadvantages that would entail.14\n\n\n21\nFinally, requiring the Government to make charging decisions immediately upon assembling evidence sufficient to establish guilt would preclude the Government from giving full consideration to the desirability of not prosecuting in particular cases. The decision to file criminal charges, with the awesome consequences it entails, requires consideration of a wide range of factors in addition to the strength of the Government's case, in order to determine whether prosecution would be in the public interest.15 Prosecutors often need more information than proof of a suspect's guilt, therefore, before deciding whether to seek an indictment. Again the instant case provides a useful illustration. Although proof of the identity of the mail thieves was not necessary to convict respondent of the possessory crimes with which he was charged, it might have been crucial in assessing respondent's culpability, as distinguished from his legal guilt. If, for example, further investigation were to show that respondent had no role in or advance knowledge of the theft and simply agreed, out of paternal loyalty, to help his son dispose of the guns once respondent discovered his son had stolen them, the United States Attorney might have decided not to prosecute, especially since at the time of the crime respondent was over 60 years old and had no prior criminal record.16 Requiring prosecution once the evidence of guilt is clear, however, could prevent a prosecutor from awaiting the information necessary for such a decision.\n\n\n22\n(9) We would be most reluctant to adopt a rule which would have these consequences absent a clear constitutional command to do so. We can find no such command in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In our view, investigative delay is fundamentally unlike delay undertaken by the Government solely \"to gain tactical advantage over the accused,\" United States v. Marion, 404 U.S., at 324, 92 S.Ct., at 465, precisely because investigative delay is not so one-sided.17 Rather than deviating from elementary standards of \"fair play and decency,\" a prosecutor abides by them if he refuses to seek indictments until he is completely satisfied that he should prosecute and will be able promptly to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Penalizing prosecutors who defer action for these reasons would subordinate the goal of \"orderly expedition\" to that of \"mere speed,\" Smith v. United States, 360 U.S. 1, 10, 79 S.Ct. 991, 997, 3 L.Ed.2d 1041 (1959). This the Due Process Clause does not require. We therefore hold that to prosecute a defendant following investigative delay does not deprive him of due process, even if his defense might have been somewhat prejudiced by the lapse of time.\n\n\n23\n(10) In the present case, the Court of Appeals stated that the only reason the Government postponed action was to await the results of additional investigation. Although there is, unfortunately, no evidence concerning the reasons for the delay in the record, the court's \"finding\" is supported by the prosecutor's implicit representation to the District Court, and explicit representation to the Court of Appeals, that the investigation continued during the time that the Government deferred taking action against respondent. The finding is, moreover, buttressed by the Government's repeated assertions in its petition for certiorari, its brief, and its oral argument in this Court, \"that the delay was caused by the government's efforts to identify persons in addition to respondent who may have participated in the offenses.\" Pet. for Cert. 14.18 We must assume that these statements by counsel have been made in good faith. In light of this explanation, it follows that compelling respondent to stand trial would not be fundamentally unfair. The Court of Appeals therefore erred in affirming the District Court's decision dismissing the indictment.\n\nIII\n\n24\n(11) In Marion we conceded that we could not determine in the abstract the circumstances in which preaccusation delay would require dismissing prosecutions. 404 U.S., at 324, 92 S.Ct., at 465. More than five years later, that statement remains true. Indeed, in the intervening years so few defendants have established that they were prejudiced by delay that neither this Court nor any lower court has had a sustained opportunity to consider the constitutional significance of various reasons for delay.19 We therefore leave to the lower courts, in the first instance, the task of applying the settled principles of due process that we have discussed to the particular circumstances of individual cases. We simply hold that in this case the lower courts erred in dismissing the indictment.\n\n\n25\nReversed.\n\n\n26\nMr. Justice STEVENS, dissenting.\n\n\n27\nIf the record presented the question which the Court decides today, I would join its well-reasoned opinion. I am unable to do so because I believe our review should be limited to the facts disclosed by the record developed in the District Court and the traditional scope of review we have exercised with regard to issues of fact.\n\n\n28\nAfter a thorough hearing on the respondent's motion to dismiss the indictment for prejudicial preindictment delay a hearing at which both sides were given every opportunity to submit evidence concerning the question the District Court found that \"(t)he Government's delay ha(d) not been explained or justified and (was) unnecessary and unreasonable.\" On appeal, the Court of Appeals concurred, noting that the District Court's determination was \"supported by the evidence.\" 532 F.2d 59, 60-61 (CA8 1976). These concurrent findings of fact make it improper, in my judgment, for this Court to make its own determination that \"the Government postponed action . . . to await the results of additional investigation,\" ante, at 796.1\n\n\n29\nThat determination is not supported by the record.2 The majority opinion correctly points out that there was \"no evidence concerning the reasons for delay in the record,\" and yet proceeds to accept as fact the representations in the Government's briefs to the Court of Appeals and to this Court that \" 'the delay was caused by the government's efforts to identify persons in addition to respondent who may have participated in the offenses.' \" Ibid. This finding of a continuing investigation, which forms the foundation of the majority opinion, comes from statements of counsel made during the appellate process. As we have said of other unsworn statements which were not part of the record and therefore could not have been considered by the trial court: \"Manifestly, (such statements) cannot be properly considered by us in the disposition of (a) case.\" Adickes v. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157-158, n. 16, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1608, n. 16, 26 L.Ed.2d 142. While I do not question the good faith of Government counsel, it is not the business of appellate courts to make decisions on the basis of unsworn matter not incorporated in a formal record.\n\n\n30\nThe findings of the District Court, as approved by the Court of Appeals, establish four relevant propositions: (1) this is a routine prosecution; (2) after the Government assembled all of the evidence on which it expects to establish respondent's guilt, it waited almost 18 months to seek an indictment; (3) the delay was prejudicial to respondent's defense; and (4) no reason whatsoever explains the delay. We may reasonably infer that the prosecutor was merely busy with other matters that he considered more important than this case.\n\n\n31\nThe question presented by those facts is not an easy one. Nevertheless, unless we are to conclude that the Constitution imposes no constraints on the prosecutor's power to postpone the filing of formal charges to suit his own convenience, I believe we must affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. A contrary position \"can be tenable only if one assumes that the constitutional right to a fair hearing includes no right whatsoever to a prompt hearing.\" Moody v. Daggett, 429 U.S. 78, 91, 97 S.Ct. 274, 281, 50 L.Ed.2d 236 (Stevens, J., dissenting). The requirement of speedy justice has been part of the Anglo-American common-law tradition since the Magna Carta. See id., at 92 n. 5, 97 S.Ct., at 281. It came to this country and was embodied in the early state constitutions, see the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780, Part I, Art. XI, and later in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. As applied to this case, in which respondent made numerous anxious inquiries of the Postal Inspectors concerning whether he would be indicted, in which the delay caused substantial prejudice to the respondent, and in which the Government has offered no justification for the delay, the right to speedy justice should be honored.\n\n\n32\nIf that right is not honored in a case of this kind, the basic values which the Framers intended to protect by the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a speedy trial, and which motivated Congress to enact the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, will become nothing more than managerial considerations for the prosecutor to manipulate.\n\n\n33\nI respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n The report indicated that the person to whom respondent admitted selling five guns had told Government agents that respondent had actually sold him eight guns which he, in turn, had sold to one Martin Koehnken. The report also indicated that Koehnken had sold three of these guns to undercover federal agents and that a search of his house had uncovered four others. Finally the report stated that the eighth gun was sold by one David Northdruft (or Northdurft) to Government agents, and that Northdruft claimed Koehnken had sold him the gun.\nAt the hearing on the motion to dismiss, respondent for the first time admitted that he had possessed and sold eight guns.\n\n\n2\n The only contrary evidence came from respondent's purchaser who told the Government investigators that he knew the guns were \"hot.\"\n\n\n3\n In March 1975, the Inspector learned of another person who claimed to have purchased a gun from respondent. App. 18. At the hearing the parties disagreed as to whether this evidence would have been admissible since it did not involve any of the guns to which the indictment related. Id., at 9-10. In any event, the Assistant United States Attorney stated that the decision to prosecute was made before this additional piece of evidence was received. Id., at 19.\n\n\n4\n Respondent admitted that he had not mentioned Stewart to the Postal Inspector when he was questioned about his source of the guns. He explained that this was because Stewart \"was a bad tomato\" and \"was liable to take a shot at me if I told (on) him.\" Id., at 13. Respondent also conceded that he did not mention either his brother's or Stewart's illness or death to the Postal Inspector on the several occasions in which respondent called the Inspector to inquire about the status of the probe.\n\n\n5\n The Inspector's report had stated that there was no evidence establishing the son's responsibility for the thefts.\n\n\n6\n The court unanimously reversed the dismissal of a fourth count of the indictment charging respondent with dealing in firearms without a license since respondent had not alleged that the missing witnesses could have provided exculpatory evidence on this charge.\n\n\n7\n In addition to challenging the Court of Appeals' holding on the constitutional issue, the United States argues that the District Court should have deferred action on the motion to dismiss until after trial, at which time it could have assessed any prejudice to the respondent in light of the events at trial. This argument, however, was not raised in the District Court or in the Court of Appeals. Absent exceptional circumstances, we will not review it here. See, e. g., Duignan v. United States, 274 U.S. 195, 200, 47 S.Ct. 566, 568, 71 L.Ed. 996 (1927); Neely v. Martin K. Eby Constr. Co., 386 U.S. 317, 330, 87 S.Ct. 1072, 1080, 18 L.Ed.2d 75 (1967).\nAt oral argument, the Government seemed to suggest that its failure to raise the procedural question in its brief in the Court of Appeals should be excused because the proceedings in that court were \"skewed\" by the fact that the District Court had based its dismissal solely on Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 48(b), and because the issue was raised by the Government in its petition for rehearing. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7-8, 51. But even assuming that the basis for the District Court's dismissal could have \"skewed\" appellate proceedings regarding the procedural question, the fact is that the opening paragraph of the argument in the Government's brief below recognized that the only issue before the court was a due process question, and the remainder of the brief treated that question on the merits. And even after the Court of Appeals issued its decision based solely on the Due Process Clause, the Government's petition for rehearing did not squarely raise the procedural issue as an alternative ground for rehearing the case en banc.\n\n\n8\n Marion also holds that Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 48(b), which permits district courts to dismiss indictments due to preindictment or postindictment delay, is \"limited to post-arrest situations.\" 404 U.S., at 319, 92 S.Ct., at 462. Since respondent was not arrested until after he was indicted, the District Court plainly erred in basing its decision on this Rule.\n\n\n9\n ABA Code of Professional Responsibility DR 7-103(A) (1969); ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, The Prosecution Function \u00a7 3.9 (App. Draft 1971).\n\n\n10\n To the extent that the period between accusation and trial has been strictly limited by legislative action, see, e. g., Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 88 Stat. 2076, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161 et seq. (1970 ed., Supp. V), compelling immediate prosecutions upon probable cause would not add to the time during which defendants stand accused, but would create a risk of guilty persons escaping punishment simply because the Government was unable to move from probable cause to guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in the short time available to it. Even absent a statute, of course, the Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment imposes restraints on the length of post-accusation delay.\n\n\n11\n Cf. United States v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 431, 96 S.Ct. 820, 831, 46 L.Ed.2d 598 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring) (\"Good police practice often requires postponing an arrest, even after probable cause has been established, in order to place the suspect under surveillance or otherwise develop further evidence necessary to prove guilt to a jury\").\n\n\n12\n Defendants also would be adversely affected by trials involving less than all of the criminal acts for which they are responsible, since they likely would be subjected to multiple trials growing out of the same transaction or occurrence.\n\n\n13\n See also Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 310, 87 S.Ct. 408, 417, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966), quoted in United States v. Marion, 404 U.S., at 325 n. 18, 92 S.Ct., at 465 n. 18:\n\"There is no constitutional right to be arrested. The police are not required to guess at their peril the precise moment at which they have probable cause to arrest a suspect, risking a violation of the Fourth Amendment if they act too soon, and a violation of the Sixth Amendment if they wait too long. Law enforcement officers are under no constitutional duty to call a halt to a criminal investigation the moment they have the minimum evidence to establish probable cause, a quantum of evidence which may fall far short of the amount necessary to support a criminal conviction.\"\n\n\n14\n In addition, if courts were required to decide in every case when the prosecution should have commenced, it would be necessary for them to trace the day-by-day progress of each investigation. Maintaining daily records would impose an administrative burden on prosecutors, and reviewing them would place an even greater burden on the courts. See also United States v. Marion, supra, at 321 n. 13, 92 S.Ct., at 464.\n\n\n15\n See, e. g., The Prosecution Function, supra, n. 9, at \u00a7 3.9(b):\n\"The prosecutor is not obliged to present all charges which the evidence might support. The prosecutor may in some circumstances and for good cause consistent with the public interest decline to prosecute, notwithstanding that evidence may exist which would support a conviction. Illustrative of the factors which the prosecutor may properly consider in exercising his discretion are:\n\"(i) the prosecutor's reasonable doubt that the accused is in fact guilty;\n\"(ii) the extent of the harm caused by the offense;\n\"(iii) the disproportion of the authorized punishment in relation to the particular offense or the offender;\n\"(iv) possible improper motives of a complainant;\n\"(v) reluctance of the victim to testify;\n\"(vi) cooperation of the accused in the apprehension or conviction of others;\n\"(vii) availability and likelihood of prosecution by another jurisdiction.\"\n\n\n16\n Of course, in this case further investigation proved unavailing and the United States Attorney ultimately decided to prosecute based solely on the Inspector's report. But this fortuity cannot transform an otherwise permissible delay into an impermissible one.\n\n\n17\n In Marion we noted with approval that the Government conceded that a \"tactical\" delay would violate the Due Process Clause. The Government renews that concession here, Brief for United States 32, and expands it somewhat by stating: \"A due process violation might also be made out upon a showing of prosecutorial delay incurred in reckless disregard of circumstances, known to the prosecution, suggesting that there existed an appreciable risk that delay would impair the ability to mount an effective defense,\" id., at 32-33, n. 25. As the Government notes, however, there is no evidence of recklessness here.\n\n\n18\n See also Pet. for Cert. 4, 8; Brief for United States 3, 8, 38; Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, 7, 10, 47.\n\n\n19\n Professor Amsterdam has catalogued some of the noninvestigative reasons for delay:\n\"(P)roof of the offense may depend upon the testimony of an undercover informer who maintains his 'cover' for a period of time before surfacing to file charges against one or more persons with whom he has dealt while disguised. . . . (I)f there is more than one possible charge against a suspect, some of them may be held back pending the disposition of others, in order to avoid the burden upon the prosecutor's office of handling charges that may turn out to be unnecessary to obtain the degree of punishment that the prosecutor seeks. There are many other motives for delay, of course, including some sinister ones, such as a desire to postpone the beginning of defense investigation, or the wish to hold a 'club' over the defendant.\n\"Additional reasons for delay may be partly or completely beyond the control of the prosecuting authorities. Offenses may not be immediately reported; investigation may not immediately identify the offender; an identified offender may not be immediately apprehendable. . . . (A)n indictment may be delayed for weeks or even months until the impaneling of the next grand jury. It is customary to think of these delays as natural and inevitable . . . but various prosecutorial decisions such as the assignment of manpower and priorities among investigations of known offenses may also affect the length of such delays.\" Speedy Criminal Trial: Rights and Remedies, 27 Stan.L.Rev. 525, 527-728 (1975).\nSee also Dickey v. Florida, 398 U.S. 30, 45-46, n. 9, 90 S.Ct. 1564, 1572-1573, 26 L.Ed.2d 26 (1970) (BRENNAN, J., concurring).\n\n\n1\n It is a settled rule of this Court that we will not review concurrent findings of fact by two courts \" 'in the absence of a very obvious and exceptional showing of error.' \" Berenyi v. Immigration Director, 385 U.S. 630, 635, 87 S.Ct. 666, 670, 17 L.Ed.2d 656, citing Graver Mfg. Co. v. Linde Co., 336 U.S. 271, 275, 69 S.Ct. 535, 537, 93 L.Ed. 672. Mr. Justice Jackson has called this a \"seasoned and wise rule . . . .\" Comstock v. Group of Investors, 335 U.S. 211, 214, 68 S.Ct. 1454, 1456, 92 L.Ed. 1911.\n\n\n2\n An examination of the transcript of the District Court hearing reveals that the Government produced no evidence as to why the indictment was delayed. The Government stipulated that it proceeded before the grand jury only on evidence collected some 17 months before the presentation and that no additional evidence had caused it to proceed. Although the Court of Appeals surmised that \"(n)o reason existed for the delay except a hope on the part of the Government that others might be discovered who may have participated in the theft(s) . . .,\" 532 F.2d, at 61, even this assumption is not borne out by the record of the District Court hearing. Although not under oath, the prosecuting attorney indicated that the Government theorized that the guns in question came from the respondent's son, who worked at a freight terminal and would have had access to the mails. Yet even this theory was never shown to be the cause of the delay. Not even the prosecuting attorney stated as much.\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"411 U.S. 213\n93 S.Ct. 1461\n36 L.Ed.2d 169\nDavid X. FONTAINE, Petitioner,v.UNITED STATES.\nNo. 71\u20146757.\nArgued Feb. 28, 1973.\nDecided April 2, 1973.\n\nSteven M. Umin, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nSamuel Huntington, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nOn November 13, 1969, the petitioner was arraigned in a federal district court upon a charge of robbery of a federally insured bank.1 He executed a written waiver of his right to counsel and to a grand jury indictment, and pleaded guilty. Before accepting the plea, the trial judge, proceeding under Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 11, addressed the petitioner personally. The petitioner acknowledged in substance that his plea was given voluntarily and knowingly, that he understood the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea, and that he was in fact guilty. See McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 464\u2014467, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 1169, 22 L.Ed.2d 418; cf. Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 242, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1711, 23 L.Ed.2d 274. The judge then accepted the guilty plea and subsequently sentenced the petitioner to 20 years in prison.\n\n\n2\nOn August 6, 1971, the petitioner filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate his sentence on the ground that his plea of guilty had been induced by a combination of fear, coercive police tactics, and illness, including mental illness. The District Judge who had accepted the petitioner's plea and sentenced him to prison considered the motion but denied it without an evidentiary hearing; the District Judge reasoned that since the requirements of Rule 11 had been met, this collateral attack was per se unavailable, stating: 'When the trial court has so questioned the accused about pleading guilty, the petitioner cannot now be heard to collaterally attack the record and deny what was said in open court.' The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed on the same grounds.\n\n\n3\nPetitioner seek certiorari to review that judgment; he urges that under the plain wording of \u00a7 2255 and our decision in Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 473, he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his claims. Petitioner's motion for relief under \u00a7 2255 sets out detailed factual allegations regarding alleged circumstances occurring after his arrest and before his appearance in court. Those allegations describe physical abuse and illness from a recent gunshot wound that required hospitalization which was documented by records tendered in support of his petition. The records also showed that a month following the plea he was again hospitalized for heroin addiction, for aggravation of the earlier gunshot would and for other severe illnesses. Petitioner further alleges that prolonged interrogation continued during the period preceding his plea. All of this, he claims, coerced his confession, his waiver of counsel, and the uncounseled plea of guilty. It is elementary that a coerced plea is open to collateral attack. Machibroda v.

Redstone, Peyton Ford, Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\nMr. Marvin E. Frankel, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nMr. Justice CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nPetitioners, husband and wife, stand convicted under \u00a7 145 of the Internal Revenue Code1 of an attempt to evade and defeat their income taxes for the year 1948. The prosecution was based on the net worth method of proof, also in issue in three companion cases2 and a number of other decisions here from the Courts of Appeals of nine circuits. During the past two decades this Court has been asked to review an increasing number of criminal cases in which proof of tax evasion rested on this theory. We have denied certiorari because the cases involved only questions of evidence and, in isolation, presented no important questions of law. In 1943 the Court did have occasion to pass upon an application of the net worth theory where the taxpayer had no records. United States v. Johnson, 319 U.S. 503, 63 S.Ct. 1233, 87 L.Ed. 1546.\n\n\n2\nIn recent years, however, tax-evasion convictions obtained under the net worth theory have come here with increasing frequency and left impressions beyond those of the previously unrelated petitions. We concluded that the method involved something more than the ordinary use of circumstantial evidence in the usual criminal case. Its bearing, therefore, on the safeguards traditionally provided in the administration of criminal justice called for a consideration of the entire theory. At our last Term a number of cases arising from the Courts of Appeals brought to our attention the serious doubts of those courts regarding the implications of the net worth method. Accordingly, we granted certiorari in these four cases and have held others to await their decision.\n\n\n3\nIn a typical net worth prosecution, the Government, having concluded that the taxpayer's records are inadequate as a basis for determining income tax liability, attempts to establish an 'opening net worth' or total net value of the taxpayer's assets at the beginning of a given year. It then proves increases in the taxpayer's net worth for each succeeding year during the period under examination and calculates the difference between the adjusted net values of the taxpayer's assets at the beginning and end of each of the years involved. The taxpayer's nondeductible expenditures, including living expenses, are added to these increases, and if the resulting figure for any year is substantially greater than the taxable income reported by the taxpayer for that year, the Government claims the excess represents unreported taxable income. In addition, it asks the jury to infer willfulness from this understatement, when taken in connection with direct evidence of 'conduct, the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to conceal.' Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492, 499, 63 S.Ct. 364, 368, 87 L.Ed. 418.\n\n\n4\nBefore proceeding with a discussion of these cases, we believe it important to outline the general problems implicit in this type of litigation. In this consideration we assume, as we must in view of its widespread use, that the Government deems the net worth method useful in the enforcement of the criminal sanctions of our income tax laws. Nevertheless, careful study indicates that it is so fraught with danger for the innocent that the courts must closely scrutinize its use.\n\n\n5\nOne basic assumption in establishing guilt by this method is that most assets derive from a taxable source, and that when this is not true the taxpayer is in a position to explain the discrepancy. The application of such an assumption raises serious legal problems in the administration of the criminal law. Unlike civil actions for the recovery of deficiencies, where the determinations of the Commissioner have prima facie validity, the prosecution must always prove the criminal charge beyond a reasonable doubt. This has led many of our courts to be disturbed by the use of the net worth method, particularly in its scope and the latitude which it allows prosecutors. E.g., Demetree v. United States, 5 Cir., 1953, 207 F.2d 892, 894; United States v. Caserta, 3 Cir., 1952, 199 F.2d 905, 907; United States v. Fenwick, 7 Cir., 177 F.2d 488.\n\n\n6\nBut the net worth method has not grown up overnight. It was first utilized in such cases as Capone v. United States, 7 Cir., 1931, 51 F.2d 609 and Guzik v. United States, 7 Cir., 1931, 54 F.2d 618, to corroborate direct proof of specific unreported income. In United States v. Johnson, supra, this Court approved of its use to support the inference that the taxpayer, owner of a vast and elaborately concealed network of gambling houses upon which he declared no income, had indeed received unreported income in a 'substantial amount.' It was a potent weapon in establishing taxable income from undisclosed sources when all other efforts failed. Since the Johnson case, however, its horizons have been widened until now it is used in run-of-the-mine cases, regardless of the amount of tax deficiency involved. In each of the four cases decided today the allegedly unreported income comes from the same disclosed sources as produced the taxpayer's reported income and in none is the tax deficiency anything like the deficiencies in Johnson, Capone or Guzik. The net worth method, it seems, has evolved from the final volley to the first shot in the Government's battle for revenue, and its use in the ordinary income-bracket cases greatly increases the chances for error. This leads us to point out the dangers that must be consciously kept in mind in order to assure adequate appraisal of the specific facts in individual cases.\n\n\n7\n1. Among the defenses often asserted is the taxpayer's claim that the net worth increase shown by the Government's statement is in reality not an increase at all because of the existence of substantial cash on hand at the starting point. This favorite defense asserts that the cache is made up of many years' savings which for various reasons were hidden and not expended until the prosecution period. Obviously, the Government has great difficulty in refuting such a contention. However, taxpayers too encounter many obstacles in convincing the jury of the existence of such hoards. This is particularly so when the emergence of the hidden savings also uncovers a fraud on the taxpayer's creditors.\n\n\n8\nIn this connection, the taxpayer frequently gives 'leads' to the Government agents indicating the specific sources from which his cash on hand has come, such as prior earnings, stock transactions, real estate profits, inheritances, gifts, etc. Sometimes these 'leads' point back to old transactions far removed from the prosecution period. Were the Government required to run down all such leads it would face grave investigative difficulties; still its failure to do so might jeopardize the position of the taxpayer.\n\n\n9\n2. As we have said, the method requires assumptions, among which is the equation of unexplained increases in net worth with unreported taxable income. Obviously such an assumption has many weaknesses. It may be that gifts, inheritances, loans and the like account for the newly acquired wealth. There is great danger that the jury may assume that once the Government has established the figures in its net worth computations, the crime of tax evasion automatically follows. The possibility of this increases where the jury, without guarding instructions, is allowed to take into the jury room the various charts summarizing the computations; bare figures have a way of acquiring an existence of their own, independent of the evidence which gave rise to them.\n\n\n10\n3. Although it may sound fair to say that the taxpayer can explain the 'bulge' in his net worth, he may be entirely honest and yet unable to recount his financial history. In addition, such a rule would tend to shift the burden of proof. Were the taxpayer compelled to come forward with evidence, he might risk lending support to the Government's case by showing loose business methods or losing the jury through his apparent evasiveness. Of course, in other criminal prosecutions juries may disbelieve and convict the innocent. But the courts must minimize this danger.\n\n\n11\n4. When there are no books and records, willfulness may be inferred by the jury from that fact coupled with proof of an understatement of income. But when the Government uses the net worth method, and the books and records of the taxpayer appear correct on their face, an inference of willfulness from net worth increases alone might be unjustified, especially where the circumstances surrounding the deficiency are as consistent with innocent mistake as with willful violation. On the other hand, the very failure of the books to disclose a proved deficiency might indicate deliberate falsification.\n\n\n12\n5. In many cases of this type, the prosecution relies on the taxpayer's statements, made to revenue agents in the course of their investigation, to establish vital links in the Government's proof. But when a revenue agent confronts the taxpayer with an apparent deficiency, the latter may be more concerned with a quick settlement than an honest search for the truth. Moreover, the prosecution may pick and choose from the taxpayer's statement, relying on the favorable portion and throwing aside that which does not bolster its position. The problem of corroboration, dealt with in the companion cases of Smith v. United States, 348 U.S. 147, 75 S.Ct. 194, and United States v. Calderon, 348 U.S. 160, 75 S.Ct. 186, therefore becomes crucial.\n\n\n13\n6. The statute defines the offense here involved by individual years. While the Government may be able to prove with reasonable accuracy an increase in net worth over a period of years, it often has great difficulty in relating that income sufficiently to any specific prosecution year. While a steadily increasing net worth may justify an inference of additional earnings, unless that increase can be reasonably allocated to the appropriate tax year the taxpayer may be convicted on counts of which he is innocent.\n\n\n14\nWhile we cannot say that these pitfalls inherent in the net worth method foreclose its use, they do require the exercise of great care and restraint. The complexity of the problem is such that it cannot be met merely by the application of general rules. Cf. Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474, 489, 71 S.Ct. 456, 465, 95 L.Ed. 456. Trial courts should approach these cases in the full realization that the taxpayer may be ensnared in a system which, though difficult for the prosecution to utilize, is equally hard for the defendant to refute. Charges should be especially clear, including, in addition to the formal instructions, a summary of the nature of the net worth method, the assumptions on which it rests, and the inferences available both for and against the accused. Appellate courts should review the cases, bearing constantly in mind the difficulties that arise when circumstantial evidence as to guilt is the chief weapon of a method that is itself only an approximation.\n\n\n15\nWith these considerations as a guide, we turn to the facts.\n\n\n16\nThe indictment returned against the Hollands embraced three counts. The first two charged Marion L. Holland, the husband, with attempted evasion of his income tax for the years 1946 and 1947. He was found not guilty by thejury on both of these counts. The third count charged Holland and his wife with attempted evasion in 1948 of the tax on $19,736.74 not reported by them in their joint return. The jury found both of them guilty. Mrs. Holland was fined $5,000, while her husband was sentenced to two years' imprisonment and fined $10,000.\n\n\n17\nThe Government's opening net worth computation shows defendants with a net worth of $19,152.59 at the beginning of the indictment period. Shortly thereafter, defendants purchased a hotel, bar and restaurant, and began operating them as the Holland House. Within three years during which they reported $31,265.92 in taxable income, their apparent net worth increased by $113,185.32.3 The Government's evidence indicated that, during 1948, the year for which defendants were convicted, their net worth increased by some $32,000, while the amount of taxable income reported by them totaled less than one-third that sum.\n\n\n18\nUse of Net Worth Method Where Books Are Apparently Adequate.\n\n\n19\nAs we have previously noted, this is not the first net worth case to reach this Court. In United States v. Johnson, supra (319 U.S. 503, 63 S.Ct. 1240), the Court affirmed a tax-evasion conviction on evidence showing that the taxpayer's expenditures had exceeded his 'available declared resources.' Since Johnson and his concealed establishments had destroyed the few records they had, the Government was forced to resort to the net worth method of proof. This Court approved on the ground that 'To require more * * * would be tantamount to holding that skilful concealment is an invincible barrier to proof', 319 U.S. at pages 517\u2014518, 63 S.Ct. at page 1240. Petitioners ask that we restrict the Johnson case to situations where the taxpayer has kept no books. They claim that \u00a7 41 of the Internal Revenue Code,4 expressly limiting the authority of the Government to deviate from the taxpayer's method of accounting, confines the net worth method to situations where the taxpayer has no books or where his books are inadequate. Despite some support for this view among the lower courts, see United States v. Riganto, D.C., 121 F.Supp. 158, 161, 162; United States v. Williams, 3 Cir., 208 F.2d 437, 437\u2014438; Remmer v. United States, 9 Cir., 205 F.2d 277, 286, judgment vacated on other grounds, 347 U.S. 227, 74 S.Ct. 450, we conclude that this argument must fail. The provision that the 'net income shall be computed * * * in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the books of such taxpayer', refers to methods such as the cash receipts or the accrual method, which allocate income and expenses between years. United States v. American Can Co., 280 U.S. 412, 419, 50 S.Ct. 177, 179, 74 L.Ed. 518. The net worth technique, as used in this case, is not a method of accounting different from the one employed by defendants. It is not a method of accounting at all, except insofar as it calls upon taxpayers to account for their unexplained income. Petitioners' accounting system was appropriate for their business purposes; and, admittedly, the Government did not detect any specific false entries therein. Nevertheless, if we believe the Government's evidence, as the jury did, we must conclude that the defendants' books were more consistent than truthful, and that many items of income had disappeared before they had even reached the recording stage. Certainly Congress never intended to make \u00a7 41 a set of blinders which prevents the Government from looking beyond the self-serving declarations in a taxpayer's books. 'The United States has relied for the collection of its income tax largely upon the taxpayer's own disclosures * * *. This system can function successfully only if those within and near taxable income keep and render true accounts.' Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 495, 63 S.Ct. 366. To protect the revenue from those who do not 'render true accounts', the Government must be free to use all legal evidence available to it in determining whether the story told by the taxpayer's books accurately reflects his financial history.\n\n\n20\nEstablishing a Definite Opening Net Worth.\n\n\n21\nWe agree with petitioners that an essential condition in cases of this type is the establishment, with reasonable certainty, of an opening net worth, to serve as a starting point from which to calculate future increases in the taxpayer's assets. The importance of accuracy in this figure is immediately apparent, as the correctness of the result depends entirely upon the inclusion in this sum of all assets on hand at the outset. The Government's net worth statement included as assets at the starting point stock costing $29,650 and $2,153.09 in cash.5 The Hollands claim that the Government failed to include in its opening net worth figure an accumulation of $113, 000 in currency and 'hundreds and possibly thousands of shares of stock' which they owned at the beginning of the prosecution period. They asserted that the cash had been accumulated prior to the opening date, $104,000 of it before 1933, and the balance between 1933 and 1945. They had kept the money, they claimed, mostly in $100 bills and at various times in a canvas bag, a suitcase, and a metal box. They had never dipped into it until 1946, when it became the source of the apparent increase in wealth which the Government later found in the form of a home, a ranch, a hotel and other properties. This was the main issue presented to the jury. The Government did not introduce any direct evidence to dispute this claim. Rather it relied on the inference that anyone who had had $104,000 in cash would not have undergone the hardship and privation endured by the Hollands all during the late 20's and throughout the 30's. During this period they lost their cafe business; accumulated $35,000 in debts which were never paid; lost their household furniture because of an unpaid balance of $92.20; suffered a default judgment for $506.66; and were forced to separate for some eight years because it was to their 'economical advantage.' During the latter part of this period, Mrs. Holland was obliged to support herself and their son by working at a motion picture house in Denver while her husband was in Wyoming. The evidence further indicated that improvements to the hotel, and other assets acquired during the prosecution years, were bought in installments and with bills of small denominations, as if out of earnings rather than from an accumulation of $100 bills. The Government also negatived the possibility of petitioners' accumulating such a sum by checking Mr. Holland's income tax returns as far back as 1913, showing that the income declared in previous years was insufficient to enable defendants to save any appreciable amount of money. The jury resolved this question of the existence of a cache of cash against the Hollands, and we believe the verdict was fully supported.\n\n\n22\nAs to the stock, Mr. Holland began dabbling in the stock market in a small way in 1937 and 1938. His purchases appear to have been negligible and on borrowed money. His only reported income from stocks was in his tax returns for 1944 and 1945 when he disclosed dividends of $1,600 and $1,850 respectively. While the record is unclear on this point, it appears that during the period from 1942 to 1945 he pledged considerable stock as collateral for loans. There is no evidence, however, showing what portions of this stock Mr. Holland actually owned at any one time, since he was trading in shares from day to day. And, even if we assume that he owned all the stock, some 4,550 shares, there is evidence that Mr. Holland's stock transactions were usually in 'stock selling for only a few dollars per share.' In this light, the Government's figure of approximately $30,000 is not out of line. In 1946 Holland reported the sale of about $50,000 in stock, but no receipt of dividends; nor were dividends reported in subsequent years. It is reasonable to assume that he sold all of his stock in 1946. In fact, Holland stated to the revenue agents that he had not 'fooled with the stock market' since the beginning of 1946; that he had not owned any stocks for two or three years prior to 1949; that he had saved about $50,000 from 1933 to 1946, and that in 1946 he had $9,000 in cash with the balance of his savings in stocks.6 The Government's evidence, bolstered by the admissions of petitioners, provided convincing proof that they had no stock other than the amount included in the opening net worth statement. By the same token, the petitioners' argument that the Government failed to account for the proceeds of stock sold by them before the starting date must also fail. The Government's evidence fully justified the jury's conclusion that there were no proceeds over and above the amount credited to petitioners.\n\n\n23\nThe Government's Investigation of Leads.\n\n\n24\nSo overwhelming, indeed, was the Government's proof on the issue of cash on hand that the Government agents did not bother to check petitioners' story that some of the cash represented proceeds from the sales of two cafe \u00a7 in the 20's; and that in 1933 and additional portion of this $113,000 in currency was obtained by exchanging some $12,000 in gold at a named bank. While sound administration of the criminal law requires that the net worth approach\u2014a powerful method of proving otherwise undetectable offenses\u2014should not be denied the Government, its failure to investigate leads furnished by the taxpayer might result in serious injustice. It is, of course, not for us to prescribe investigative procedures,7 but it is within the province of the courts to pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence to convict. When the Government rests its case solely on the approximations and circumstantial inferences of a net worth computation, the cogency of its proof depends upon its effective negation of reasonable explanations by the taxpayer inconsistent with guilt. Such refutation might fail when the Government does not track down relevant leads furnished by the taxpayer\u2014leads reasonably susceptible of being checked, which, if true, would establish the taxpayer's innocence. When the Government fails to show an investigation into the validity of such leads, the trial judge may consider them as true and the Government's case insufficient to go to the jury. This should aid in forestalling unjust prosecutions, and have the practical advantage of eliminating the dilemma, especially serious in this type of case, of the accused's being forced by the risk of an adverse verdict to come forward to substantiate leads which he had previously furnished the Government. It is a procedure entirely consistent with the position long espoused by the Government, that its duty is not to convict but to see that justice is done.\n\n\n25\nIn this case, the Government's detailed investigation was a complete answer to the petitioners' explanations. Admitting that in cases of this kind it 'would be desirable to track to its conclusion every conceivable line of inquiry,' the Government centered its inquiry on the explanations of the Hollands and entered upon a detailed investigation of their lives covering several states and over a score of years. The jury could have believed that Mr. Holland had received moneys from the sale of cafe \u00a7 in the twenties and that he had turned in gold in 1933 and still it could reasonably have concluded that the Hollands lacked the claimed cache of currency in 1946, the crucial year. Even if these leads were assumed to be true, the Government's evidence was sufficient to convict. The distant incidents relied on by petitioners were so remote in time and in their connection with subsequent events proved by the Government that, whatever petitioner's net worth in 1933, it appears by convincing evidence that on January 1, 1946, they had only such assets as the Government credited to them in its opening net worth statement.\n\n\n26\nNet Worth Increases Must be Attributable to Taxable Income.\n\n\n27\nAlso requisite to the use of the net worth method is evidence supporting the inference that the defendant's net worth increases are attributable to currently taxable income.\n\n\n28\nThe Government introduced evidence tending to show that although the business of the hotel apparently increased during the years in question, the reported profits fell to approximately one-quarter of the amount declared by the previous management in a comparable period;8 that the cash register tapes, on which the books were based, were destroyed by the petitioners; and that the books did not reflect the receipt of money later withdrawn from the hotel's cash register for the personal living expenses of the petitioners and for payments made for restaurant supplies. The unrecorded items in this latter category totaled over $12,500 for 1948. Thus there was ample evidence that not all the income from the hotel had been included in its books and records. In fact, the net worth increase claimed by the Government for 1948 could have come entirely from the unreported income of the hotel and still the hotel's total earnings for the year would have been only 73% of the sum reported by the previous owner for the comparable period in 1945.\n\n\n29\nBut petitioners claim the Government failed to adduce adequate proof because it did not negative all the possible nontaxable sources of the alleged net worth increases\u2014gifts, loans, inheritances, etc. We cannot agree. The Government's proof, in our view, carried with it the negations the petitioners urge. Increases in net worth, standing alone, cannot be assumed to be attributable to currently taxable income. But proof of a likely source, from which the jury could reasonably find that the net worth increases sprang, is sufficient. In the Johnson case, where there was no direct evidence of the source of the taxpayer's income, this Court's conclusion that the taxpayer 'had large, unreported income was reinforced by proof * * * that (for certain years his) private expenditures * * * exceeded his available declared resources.' This was sufficient to support 'the finding that he had some unreported income which was properly attributable to his earnings * * *.'  United States v. Johnson, 319 U.S. at page 517, 63 S.Ct. at page 1240. There the taxpayer was the owner of an undisclosed business capable of producing taxable income; here the disclosed business of the petitioners was proven to be capable of producing much more income than was reported and in a quantity sufficient to account for the net worth increases. Any other rule would burden the Government with investigating the many possible nontaxable sources of income, each of which is as unlikely as it is difficult to disprove. This is not to say that the Government may disregard explanations of the defendant reasonably susceptible of being checked. But where relevant leads are not forthcoming, the Government is not required to negate every possible source of nontaxable income, a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant. See Rossi v. United States, 289 U.S. 89, 91\u201492, 53 S.Ct. 532, 533, 77 L.Ed. 1051.\n\n\n30\nThe Burden of Proof Remains on the Government.\n\n\n31\nNor does this rule shift the burden of proof. The Government must still prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt though not to a mathematical certainty. The settled standards of the criminal law are applicable to net worth cases just as to prosecutions for other crimes. Once the Government has established its case, the defendant remains quiet at his peril. Cf. Yee Hem v. United States, 268 U.S. 178, 185, 45 S.Ct. 470, 472, 69 L.Ed. 904. The practical disadvantages to the taxpayer are lessened by the pressures on the Government to check and negate relevant leads.\n\n\n32\nWillfulness Must be Present.\n\n\n33\nA final element necessary for conviction is willfulness. The petitioners contend that willfulness 'involves a specific intent which must be proven by independent evidence and which cannot be inferred from the mere understatement of income.' This is a fair statement of the rule. Here, however, there was evidence of a consistent pattern of underreporting large amounts of income, and of the failure on petitioners' part to include all of their income in their books and records. Since, on proper submission, the jury could have found that these acts supported an inference of willfulness, their verdict must stand. Spies v. United States, supra, 317 U.S. at pages 499\u2014500, 63 S.Ct. 368.\n\n\n34\nThe Charge to the Jury.\n\n\n35\nPetitioners press upon us, finally, the contention that the instructions of the trial court were so erroneous and misleading as to constitute grounds for reversal. We have carefully reviewed the instructions and cannot agree. But some require comment. The petitioners assail the refusal of the trial judge to instruct that where the Government's evidence is circumstantial it must be such as to exclude every reasonable hypothesis other than that of guilt. There is some support for this type of instruction in the lower court decisions, Garst v. United States, 4 Cir., 180 F. 339, 343; Anderson v. United States, 5 Cir., 30 F.2d 485\u2014487; Stutz v. United States, 5 Cir., 47 F.2d 1029, 1030; Hanson v. United States, 6 Cir., 208 F.2d 914, 916, but the better rule is that where the jury is properly instructed on the standards for reasonable doubt, such an additional instruction on circumstantial evidence is confusing and incorrect, United States v. Austin-Bagley Corp., 2 Cir., 31 F.2d 229, 234, certiorari denied, 279 U.S. 863, 49 S.Ct. 479, 73 L.Ed. 1002; United States v. Becker, 2 Cir., 62 F.2d 1007, 1010; 1 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.), \u00a7\u00a7 25\u201426.\n\n\n36\nCircumstantial evidence in this respect is intrinsically no different from testimonial evidence. Admittedly, circumstantial evidence may in some cases point to a wholly incorrect result. Yet this is equally true of testimonial evidence. In both instances, a jury is asked to weigh the chances that the evidence correctly points to guilt against the possibility of inaccuracy or ambiguous inference. In both, the jury must use its experience with people and events in weighing the probabilities. If the jury is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, we can require no more.\n\n\n37\nEven more insistent is the petitioners' attack, not made below, on the charge of the trial judge as to reasonable doubt. He defined it as 'the kind of doubt . . . which you folks in the more serious and important affairs of your own lives might be willing to act upon.' We think this section of the charge should have been in terms of the kind of doubt that would make a person hesitate to act, see Bishop v. United States, 71 App.D.C. 132, 107 F.2d 297, 303, rather than the kind on which he would be willing to act. But we believe that the instruction as given was not of the type that could mislead the jury into finding no reasonable doubt when in fact there was some. A definition of a doubt as something the jury would act upon would seem to create confusion rather than misapprehension. 'Attempts to explain the term 'reasonable doubt' do not usually result in making it any clearer to the minds of the jury,' Miles v. United States, 103 U.S. 304, 312, 26 L.Ed. 481, and we feel that, taken as a whole, the instructions correctly conveyed the concept of reasonable doubt to the jury.\n\n\n38\nPetitioners also assign as error the refusal of the trial judge to give instructions on the wording of the criminal statute under which they were indicted, even though the judge fully and correctly instructed the jury on every element of the crime. The impossibility of pointing to any way in which defendants' rights were prejudiced by this, assuming it was error, is enough to indicate that the trial judge was correct, see United States v. Center Veal and Beef Co., 2 Cir., 162 F.2d 766, 771. There is here no question of the jury's duty to apply the law to the facts. That operation implies the application of a general standard to the specific physical facts as found by the jury. The meanings of standards such as willfulness were properly explained by the trial judge in no greater particularity than necessary, and thus the jury's function was not invaded.\n\n\n39\nIn the light of these considerations the judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n40\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n1\n 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 145, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 145.

In recent years, nearly all of the students have been referred to the school by city school committees under a Massachusetts statute or by a state agency. When the students are referred to the school by the city committees, these cities pay for the students' education.  The school also receives funds from a number of state and federal agencies.  Public funds have recently accounted for at least 90% of the school's operating budget.  To be eligible for tuition funding under the state statute, the school must comply with a variety of state regulations, but these regulations impose few specific personnel requirements.  Similarly, the school's contracts with the State and the city committees generally do not cover personnel policies.  Petitioners, a former vocational counselor and teachers at the school, brought separate actions in Federal District Court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming that they had been discharged by the school in violation of their First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  The court dismissed the counselor's action but denied a motion to dismiss the teachers' action, reaching conflicting conclusions as to whether the school had acted under color of state law so as to be subject to liability under \u00a7 1983.  On appeal the cases were consolidated, and the Court of Appeals held that it was error to conclude that the school acted under color of state law, since, although regulated by the State, it was not dominated by the State, especially with respect to decisions involving discharge of personnel.\nHeld :  Respondent school did not act under color of state law when it discharged petitioner employees, and hence petitioners have not stated a claim for relief under \u00a7 1983.  Pp. 837-843.\n(a) The ultimate issue in determining whether a person is subject to suit under \u00a7 1983 is the same question posed in cases arising under the Fourteenth Amendment:  Is the alleged infringement of federal rights fairly attributable to the State? Pp. 837-838\n(b) The school's receipt of public funds does not make the discharge decisions acts of the State.  Cf. Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 102 S.Ct. 2777, 73 L.Ed.2d 534.  The school is not fundamentally different from many private corporations whose business depends primarily on contracts with the government, and whose acts do not become acts of the government by reason of their significant or even total engagement in performing public contracts.  The decision to discharge petitioners was not compelled or even influenced by any state regulation, and the fact that the school performs a public function in educating maladjusted high school students does not make its acts state action.  Moreover, since the school's fiscal relationship with the State is not any different from that of many contractors performing services for the government, there is no \"symbiotic relationship\" between the school and the State.  Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45, distinguished.  Pp 839-843.\n641 F.2d 14 (C.A.1 1981) affirmed.\nZachary R. Karol, Boston, Mass., for petitioners.\nMatthew H. Feinberg, Boston, Mass., for respondents.\nChief Justice BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nWe granted certiorari to decide whether a private school, whose income is derived primarily from public sources and which is regulated by public authorities, acted under color of state law when it discharged certain employees.\n\n\n2\n* A.\n\n\n3\nRespondent Kohn is the director of the New Perspectives School, a nonprofit institution located on privately owned property in Brookline, Massachusetts.  The school was founded as a private institution and is operated by a board of directors, none of whom are public officials or are chosen by public officials. The school specializes in dealing with students who have experienced difficulty completing public high schools;  many have drug, alcohol, or behavioral problems, or other special needs.  In recent years, nearly all of the students at the school have been referred to it by the Brookline or Boston School Committees, or by the Drug Rehabilitation Division of the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health.  The school issues high school diplomas certified by the Brookline School Committee.\n\n\n4\nWhen students are referred to the school by Brookline or Boston under Chapter 766 of the Massachusetts Acts of 1972, the School Committees in those cities pay for the students' education.1  The school also receives funds from a number of other state and federal agencies.  In recent years, public funds have accounted for at least 90%, and in one year 99%, of respondent school's operating budget.  There were approximately 50 students at the school in those years and none paid tuition.2\n\n\n5\nTo be eligible for tuition funding under Chapter 766, the school must comply with a variety of regulations, many of which are common to all schools.  The State has issued detailed regulations concerning matters ranging from recordkeeping to student-teacher ratios.  Concerning personnel policies, the Chapter 766 regulations require the school to maintain written job descriptions and written statements describing personnel standards and procedures, but they impose few specific requirements.\n\n\n6\nThe school is also regulated by Boston and Brookline as a result of its Chapter 766 funding.  By its contract with the Boston School Committee, which refers to the school as a \"contractor,\" the school must agree to carry out the individualized plan developed for each student referred to the school by the Committee.  See n. 1, supra.  The contract specifies that school employees are not city employees.3\n\n\n7\nThe school also has a contract with the State Drug Rehabilitation Division.  Like the contract with the Boston School Committee, that agreement refers to the school as a \"contractor.\" It provides for reimbursement for services provided for students referred to the school by the Drug Rehabilitation Division, and includes requirements concerning the services to be provided. Except for general requirements, such as an equal employment opportunity requirement, the agreement does not cover personnel policies.\n\n\n8\nWhile five of the six petitioners were teachers at the school, petitioner Rendell-Baker was a vocational counselor hired under a grant from the federal Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, whose funds are distributed in Massachusetts through the State Committee on Criminal Justice.  As a condition of the grant, the Committee on Criminal Justice must approve the school's initial hiring decisions.  The purpose of this requirement is to insure that the school hires vocational counselors who meet the qualifications described in the school's grant proposal to the Committee;  the Committee does not interview applicants for counselor positions.\n\nB\n\n9\nRendell-Baker was discharged by the school in January 1977, and the five other petitioners were discharged in June 1978. Rendell-Baker's discharge resulted from a dispute over the role of a student-staff council in making hiring decisions.  A dispute arose when some students presented a petition to the school's board of directors in December 1976, seeking greater responsibilities for the student-staff council.  Director Kohn opposed the proposal, but Rendell-Baker supported it and so advised the board.  On December 13, Kohn notified the State Committee on Criminal Justice, which funded Rendell-Baker's position, that she intended to dismiss Rendell-Baker and employ someone else.  Kohn notified Rendell-Baker of her dismissal in January 1977.\n\n\n10\nRendell-Baker then advised the board of directors that she had been discharged without due process because she exercised her First Amendment rights.  She demanded reinstatement or a hearing. The school agreed to apply a new policy, calling for appointment of a grievance committee, to consider her claims.  Rendell-Baker also complained to the State Committee on Criminal Justice, which asked the school to provide a written explanation for her discharge.  After the school complied, the Committee responded that it was satisfied with the explanation, but notified the school that it would not pay any backpay or other damages award Rendell-Baker might obtain from it as a result of her discharge. The Committee told Rendell-Baker that it had no authority to order a hearing, although it would refuse to approve the hiring of another counselor if the school disregarded its agreement to apply its new grievance procedure in her case.  At this point Rendell-Baker objected to the composition of the grievance committee, and its proceedings apparently never went forward. Rendell-Baker filed this suit in July 1977 under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that she had been discharged in violation of her rights under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n\n11\nIn the spring of 1978, students and staff voiced objections to Kohn's policies.  The five petitioners other than Rendell-Baker, who were all teachers at the school, wrote a letter to the board of directors urging Kohn's dismissal.  When the board affirmed its confidence in Kohn, students from the school picketed the home of the president of the board.  The students were threatened with suspension;  a local newspaper then ran a story about the controversy at the school.  In response to the story, the five petitioners wrote a letter to the editor in which they stated that they thought the prohibition of picketing was unconstitutional.  On the day the letter to the editor appeared, the five teachers told the president of the board that they were forming a union.  Kohn discharged the teachers the next day.  They brought suit against the school and its directors in December 1978.  Like Rendell-Baker, they sought relief under \u00a7 1983, alleging that their rights under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments had been violated.\n\nC\n\n12\nOn April 16, 1980, the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, 488 F.Supp. 764, granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment in the suit brought by Rendell-Baker.  A claim may be brought under \u00a7 1983 only if the defendant acted \"under color\" of state law.4  The District Court took as its standard \" 'whether there is a sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged action of the regulated entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself,' \" quoting Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, 351, 95 S.Ct. 449, 453, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974).  Noting that, although the State regulated the school in many ways, it imposed few conditions on the school's personnel policies, the District Court concluded that the nexus between the school and the State was not sufficiently close so that the action of the school in discharging Rendell-Baker could be considered action of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\n\n13\nNine days earlier, on April 7, 1980, a different judge of the District Court for the District of Massachusetts had reached a contrary conclusion on the same question in the case brought by the other five petitioners.  His opinion stressed the school's dependency on public funding and its regulation by numerous public entities.  It also noted that although education was not a uniquely public function, it is primarily a public function, and that Brookline did not maintain a school to serve maladjusted adolescents with drug, alcohol, or emotional problems.  The District Court, following the guidelines of Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, 722, 81 S.Ct. 856, 860, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961), concluded that the school performed a \"public function,\" as described in Jackson, supra, at 352, 95 S.Ct., at 454.  Accordingly, it held that the defendants acted under color of state law and denied the motion to dismiss.  However, on June 13, 1980, noting that there was substantial ground for disagreement on that holding, the District Court certified its order as immediately appealable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).\n\nD\n\n14\nThe Court of Appeals for the First Circuit consolidated the two actions.  It noted that the school's funding, regulation, and function show that it has a close relationship with the State. However, it stressed that the school is managed by a private board and that the State has relatively little involvement in personnel matters.  It concluded that the school, although regulated by the State, was not dominated by the State, especially with respect to decisions involving the discharge of personnel.  The Court of Appeals then concluded that the District Court which certified the question in the action brought by the five teachers had erred in concluding that the defendants acted under color of state law.\n\n\n15\nThe Court of Appeals separately considered Rendell-Baker's claim that she was discharged under color of state law since her position was funded directly by the Committee on Criminal Justice. The court rejected her claim, noting that the Committee had the power to insure that those hired had the qualifications described in the grant proposal, but that it did not have any other control over the school's personnel decisions.  It therefore affirmed the District Court's dismissal of her action.  641 F.2d 14 (1981).\n\n\n16\nWe granted certiorari, 454 U.S. 891, 102 S.Ct. 385, 70 L.Ed.2d 205 (1981), and we affirm.\n\nII\nA.\n\n17\nPetitioners do not claim that their discharges were discriminatory in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Nor do they claim that their discharges were unfair labor practices in violation of the National Labor Relations Act. Rather, they allege that respondents violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, see n. 4, supra, by discharging them because of their exercise of their First Amendment right of free speech and without the process due them under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Although Title VII and the National Labor Relations Act govern action by private parties making personnel decisions, it is fundamental that the First Amendment prohibits governmental infringement on the right of free speech.  Similarly, the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits the states from denying federal constitutional rights and which guarantees due process, applies to acts of the states, not to acts of private persons or entities.   Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 11, 3 S.Ct. 18, 21, 27 L.Ed. 835 (1883); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 13, 68 S.Ct. 836, 842, 92 L.Ed. 1161 (1948).5  And \u00a7 1983, which was enacted pursuant to the authority of Congress to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits interference with federal rights under color of state law.\n\n\n18\nIn United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 794, n. 7, 86 S.Ct. 1152, 1157, n. 7, 16 L.Ed.2d 267 (1966), the Court stated:\n\n\n19\n\"In cases under \u00a7 1983, 'under color' of law has consistently      been treated as the same thing as the 'state action' required      under the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\n\n20\nSee also, United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 326, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 1043, 85 L.Ed. 1368 (1941).  The ultimate issue in determining whether a person is subject to suit under \u00a7 1983 is the same question posed in cases arising under the Fourteenth Amendment:  is the alleged infringement of federal rights \"fairly attributable to the State?\"  Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 937, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 2754, 73 L.Ed.2d 482.  The core issue presented in this case is not whether petitioners were discharged because of their speech or without adequate procedural protections, but whether the school's action in discharging them can fairly be seen as state action.6  If the action of the respondent school is not state action, our inquiry ends.\n\nB\n\n21\nIn Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 102 S.Ct. 2777, 73 L.Ed.2d 534, the Court analyzed the state action requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Court considered whether certain nursing homes were state actors for the purpose of determining whether decisions regarding transfers of patients could be fairly attributed to the State, and hence be subjected to Fourteenth Amendment due process requirements.  The challenged transfers primarily involved decisions, made by physicians and nursing home administrators, to move patients from \"skilled nursing facilities\" to less expensive \"health related facilities.\"  457 U.S., at 1005, 102 S.Ct., at 2786.  Like the New Perspectives School, the nursing homes were privately owned and operated.   Id., at 1003, 102 S.Ct., at 2785. Relying on Flagg Brothers, Inc. v. Brooks, 436 U.S. 149, 98 S.Ct. 1729, 56 L.Ed.2d 185 (1978);  Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, 95 S.Ct. 449, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974);  Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 92 S.Ct. 1965, 32 L.Ed.2d 627 (1972);  and Adickes v. S. H. Kress Co., 398 U.S. 144, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970), the Court held that, \"a State normally can be held responsible for a private decision only when it has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the State.\"  457 U.S. at 1004, 102 S.Ct., at 2786.  In determining that the transfer decisions were not actions of the State, the Court considered each of the factors alleged by petitioners here to make the discharge decisions of the New Perspectives School fairly attributable to the State.\n\n\n22\nFirst, the nursing homes, like the school, depended on the State for funds;  the State subsidized the operating and capital costs of the nursing homes, and paid the medical expenses of more than 90% of the patients.  457 U.S., at 1011, 102 S.Ct., at 2789. Here the Court of Appeals concluded that the fact that virtually all of the school's income was derived from government funding was the strongest factor to support a claim of state action.  641 F.2d, at 24.  But in Blum v. Yaretsky, we held that the similar dependence of the nursing homes did not make the acts of the physicians and nursing home administrators acts of the State, and we conclude that the school's receipt of public funds does not make the discharge decisions acts of the State.\n\n\n23\nThe school, like the nursing homes, is not fundamentally different from many private corporations whose business depends primarily on contracts to build roads, bridges, dams, ships, or submarines for the government.  Acts of such private contractors do not become acts of the government by reason of their significant or even total engagement in performing public contracts.\n\n\n24\nThe school is also analogous to the public defender found not to be a state actor in Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981).  There we concluded that, although the State paid the public defender, her relationship with her client was \"identical to that existing between any other lawyer and client.\"  Id., at 318, 102 S.Ct., at 449.  Here the relationship between the school and its teachers and counselors is not changed because the State pays the tuition of the students.\n\n\n25\nA second factor considered in Blum v. Yaretsky was the extensive regulation of the nursing homes by the State.  There the State was indirectly involved in the transfer decisions challenged in that case because a primary goal of the State in regulating nursing homes was to keep costs down by transferring patients from intensive treatment centers to less expensive facilities when possible.  Both state and federal regulations encouraged the nursing homes to transfer patients to less expensive facilities when appropriate.  457 U.S., at 1007-1008, 1009-1110, 102 S.Ct., at 2787-2789.  The nursing homes were extensively regulated in many other ways as well.  The Court relied on Jackson, where we held that state regulation, even if \"extensive and detailed,\" 419 U.S., at 350, 95 S.Ct., at 453, did not make a utility's actions state action.\n\n\n26\nHere the decisions to discharge the petitioners were not compelled or even influenced by any state regulation.  Indeed, in contrast to the extensive regulation of the school generally, the various regulators showed relatively little interest in the school's personnel matters.  The most intrusive personnel regulation promulgated by the various government agencies was the requirement that the Committee on Criminal Justice had the power to approve persons hired as vocational counselors.  Such a regulation is not sufficient to make a decision to discharge, made by private management, state action. See n. 6, supra.\n\n\n27\nThe third factor asserted to show that the school is a state actor is that it performs a \"public function.\"  However, our holdings have made clear that the relevant question is not simply whether a private group is serving a \"public function.\"  We have held that the question is whether the function performed has been \"traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the State.\"   Jackson, supra, at 353, 95 S.Ct., at 454;  quoted in Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S., at 1011, 102 S.Ct., at 2789 (emphasis added).  There can be no doubt that the education of maladjusted high school students is a public function, but that is only the beginning of the inquiry. Chapter 766 of the Massachusetts Acts of 1972 demonstrates that the State intends to provide services for such students at public expense.  That legislative policy choice in no way makes these services the exclusive province of the State.  Indeed, the Court of Appeals noted that until recently the State had not undertaken to provide education for students who could not be served by traditional public schools.  641 F.2d, at 26.  That a private entity performs a function which serves the public does not make its acts state action.7\n\n\n28\nFourth, petitioners argue that there is a \"symbiotic relationship\" between the school and the State similar to the relationship involved in Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961).  Such a claim is rejected in Blum v. Yaretsky, and we reject it here.  In Burton, the Court held that the refusal of a restaurant located in a public parking garage to serve Negroes constituted state action. The Court stressed that the restaurant was located on public property and that the rent from the restaurant contributed to the support of the garage.  365 U.S., at 723, 81 S.Ct., at 860.  In response to the argument that the restaurant's profits, and hence the State's financial position, would suffer if it did not discriminate, the Court concluded that this showed that the State profited from the restaurant's discriminatory conduct.  The Court viewed this as support for the conclusion that the State should be charged with the discriminatory actions.  Here the school's fiscal relationship with the State is not different from that of many contractors performing services for the government.  No symbiotic relationship such as existed in Burton exists here.\n\nC\n\n29\nWe hold that petitioners have not stated a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983;  accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit is\n\n\n30\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n31\nJustice WHITE, concurring in the judgments.\n\n\n32\nThe issue in Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 102 S.Ct. 2777, 73 L.Ed.2d 534, is whether a private nursing home's decision to discharge or transfer a Medicaid patient satisfies the state-action requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment.  To satisfy this requirement, respondents must show that the transfer or discharge is made on the basis of some rule of decision for which the State is responsible.  Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 937, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 2754, 73 L.Ed.2d 482.  It is not enough to show that the State takes certain actions in response to this private decision.  The rule of decision implicated in the actions at issue here appears to be nothing more than a medical judgment. This is the clear import of the majority's conclusion that the \"decisions ultimately turn on medical judgments made by private parties according to professional standards that are not established by the State,\" 457 U.S., at 1008, 102 S.Ct., at 2788, with which I agree.\n\n\n33\nSimilarly, the allegations of the petitioners in Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, No. 80-2102 [457 U.S. 830, 102 S.Ct. 2764, 73 L.Ed.2d 418], fail to satisfy the state-action requirement.  In this case, the question of state action focuses on an employment decision made by a private school that receives most of its funding from public sources and is subject to state regulation in certain respects.  For me, the critical factor is the absence of any allegation that the employment decision was itself based upon some rule of conduct or policy put forth by the State.  As the majority states, \"in contrast to the extensive regulation of the school generally, the various regulators showed relatively little interest in the school's personnel matters.\"  Ante, at 841.  The employment decision remains, therefore, a private decision not fairly attributable to the State.\n\n\n34\nAccordingly, I concur in the judgments.\n\n\n35\nJustice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting.\n\n\n36\nPetitioners in these consolidated cases, former teachers and a counselor at the New Perspectives School in Brookline, Mass., were discharged by the school's administrators when they criticized certain school policies.  They commenced actions under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming that they had been discharged in violation of the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Court today holds that their suits must be dismissed because the school did not act \"under color\" of state law.  According to the majority, the decision of the school to discharge petitioners cannot fairly be regarded as a decision of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\n\n37\nIn my view, this holding simply cannot be justified.  The State has delegated to the New Perspectives School its statutory duty to educate children with special needs.  The school receives almost all of its funds from the State, and is heavily regulated. This nexus between the school and the State is so substantial that the school's action must be considered state action.  I therefore dissent.\n\n\n38\n* The critical facts of this case deserve restatement.  Chapter 766 of the Massachusetts Acts of 1972, Mass.Gen.Laws Ann., ch. 71B, \u00a7\u00a7 1-14 (West 1981), provides that all students with special needs are entitled to a suitable publicly funded education under the supervision of the state and local governments.  The school committee of every city, town, or school district in Massachusetts must identify all children who, because of physical or emotional disability, have special educational needs.  It must prepare an individualized educational program tailored to meet those needs, and arrange for the implementation of that program.  The school committee may offer the programs through existing public schools, or it may contract with private schools to implement the programs. If the school committee decides to place a child in a private school, it must bear all the expenses associated with the placement;  parents need not pay the tuition.\n\n\n39\nIf a school committee decides to place a child in a private school, it must closely monitor the child's educational progress. Every three months it must determine whether the child can be transferred to a less restrictive environment, such as a public school.  603 Code Mass.Regs. \u00a7 28, &Par; 502.4(i), 804.2 (1979).  In general, special education programs must be provided in the least restrictive environment possible.  Id., at \u00b6 322.2.  If the parents object to the placement of their child in private school, the child may remain in public school unless he is disruptive or dangerous.  Parents may also place their child in a private school of their own choice.  If they do so, however, they must pay the tuition.\n\n\n40\nAs of 1978, all 50 students enrolled at the New Perspectives School were children with alcohol, drug, behavioral, or other special problems.  They had been placed there pursuant to Chapter 766 by the town of Brookline, the city of Boston, or the Drug Rehabilitation Division of the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health.  None of the students pays tuition.  When they graduate, they receive a diploma certified by the Town of Brookline School Committee.\n\n\n41\nThe New Perspectives School is funded almost entirely by governmental agencies.  In fiscal year 1975-1976, public funds accounted for 91% of the school's budget.  In fiscal year 1976-1977, public funds accounted for 99% of the budget.  The school has received money from the town of Brookline, the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health, the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services, the Massachusetts Division of Family and Children's Services, the Massachusetts Office for Children, and the federal Law Enforcement Assistance Administration.  See 641 F.2d 14, 17 (C.A.1 1981).\n\n\n42\nIn order to remain eligible for placements and funding under Chapter 766, the New Perspectives School must comply with a variety of regulations.  The Massachusetts Department of Education has promulgated \"Guidelines for Approval of Day Educational Component in Private Schools under Chapter 766.\"  These guidelines cover almost every aspect of a private school's operations, including financial recordkeeping, student discipline, medical examinations for students, parent involvement, health care, subjects of instruction, teacher-student ratio, student records, confidentiality of records, transportation, insurance, nutrition, food preparation, toileting procedures, physical facilities, and classroom equipment.  The guidelines also address personnel policies.  They set forth minimum standards for staff training, use of volunteers, teacher qualifications, and teacher evaluations.  They further require that the school maintain written job descriptions and a written policy on criteria and procedures for hiring and dismissal, and procedures for handling staff complaints.  And they require that the school provide vacations and other benefits.\n\n\n43\nThe New Perspectives School is subject to additional regulation under contracts with each of the governmental units that refers students.  A contract with the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health, Drug Rehabilitation Division, requires the school to provide counseling, educational, and vocational services for drug abusers.  Under a contract with the city of Boston, the school must carry out the educational plan devised by the Boston School Committee for each Boston student placed with the school.  The school must submit periodic reports to the city and is subject to inspection at any time during normal business hours.  Finally, the school is bound by regulations contained in contracts with the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services and the Brookline School Committee.  See 641 F.2d, at 18.\n\nII\n\n44\nThe decisions of this Court clearly establish that where there is a symbiotic relationship between the State and a privately owned enterprise, so that the State and a privately owned enterprise are participants in a joint venture, the actions of the private enterprise may be attributable to the State. \"Conduct that is formally 'private' may become so entwined with governmental policies or so impregnated with a governmental character\" that it can be regarded as governmental action.  Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296, 299, 86 S.Ct. 486, 488, 15 L.Ed.2d 373 (1966).  See Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961);  see also Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, 351, 95 S.Ct. 449, 453, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974);  Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 175, 92 S.Ct. 1965, 1972, 32 L.Ed.2d 627 (1972).  The question whether such a relationship exists \"can be determined only in the framework of the peculiar facts or circumstances present.\" Burton, supra, at 726, 81 S.Ct., at 862.  Here, an examination of the facts and circumstances leads inexorably to the conclusion that the actions of the New Perspectives School should be attributed to the State;  it is difficult to imagine a closer relationship between a government and a private enterprise.\n\n\n45\nThe New Perspectives School receives virtually all of its funds from state sources.  This financial dependence on the State is an important indicium of governmental involvement. The school's very survival depends on the State.  If the State chooses, it may exercise complete control over the school's operations simply by threatening to withdraw financial support if the school takes action that it considers objectionable.\n\n\n46\nThe school is heavily regulated and closely supervised by the State.  This fact provides further support for the conclusion that its actions should be attributed to the State.  The school's freedom of decisionmaking is substantially circumscribed by the Massachusetts Department of Education's guidelines and the various contracts with state agencies.  For example, the school is required to develop and comply with written rules for hiring and dismissal of personnel.  Almost every decision the school makes is substantially affected in some way by the State's regulations.1\n\n\n47\nThe fact that the school is providing a substitute for public education is also an important indicium of state action.  The provision of education is one of the most important tasks performed by government:  it ranks at the very apex of the function of a State.  Ambach v. Norwick, 441 U.S. 68, 77, 99 S.Ct. 1589, 1594, 60 L.Ed.2d 49 (1979).2  Of course, as the majority emphasizes, ante, at 2772, performance of a public function is by itself sufficient to justify treating a private entity as a state actor only where the function has been \"traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the State.\"   Jackson, supra, at 353, 95 S.Ct., at 454.  See Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.S. 501, 66 S.Ct. 276, 90 L.Ed. 265 (1946);  Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649, 64 S.Ct. 757, 88 L.Ed. 987 (1944). But the fact that a private entity is performing a vital public function, when coupled with other factors demonstrating a close connection with the State, may justify a finding of state action. Cf. Evans v. Newton, supra.\n\n\n48\nThe school's provision of a substitute for public education deserves particular emphasis because of the role of Chapter 766. Under this statute, the State is required to provide a free education to all children, including those with special needs. Clearly, if the State had decided to provide the service itself, its conduct would be measured against constitutional standards. The State should not be permitted to avoid constitutional requirements simply by delegating its statutory duty to a private entity.3  In my view, such a delegation does not convert the performance of the duty from public to private action when the duty is specific and the private institution's decisionmaking authority is significantly curtailed.\n\n\n49\nWhen an entity is not only heavily regulated and funded by the State, but also provides a service that the State is required to provide, there is a very close nexus with the State. Under these circumstances, it is entirely appropriate to treat the entity as an arm of the State.  Cf. Smith v. Allwright, supra; Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461, 469, 73 S.Ct. 809, 813, 97 L.Ed. 1152 (1953) (opinion of Black, J.).  Here, since the New Perspectives School exists solely to fulfill the State's obligations under Chapter 766, I think it fully reasonable to conclude that the school is a state actor.\n\n\n50\nIndeed, I would conclude that the actions challenged here were under color of state law, even if I believed that the sole basis for state action was the fact that the school was providing Chapter 766 services.  Petitioners claim that they were discharged because they supported student demands for increased responsibilities in school affairs, that is, because they criticized the school's educational policies.  If petitioners' allegations are true, then the school has adopted a specific view of the sort of education that should be provided under the statute, and refuses to tolerate departures from that view.4  The State, by refusing to intervene, has effectively endorsed that view of its duties under Chapter 766.  In short, because petitioners' criticism was directly addressed to the State's responsibilities under Chapter 766, a finding of state action is justified.5\n\n\n51\nThe majority repeatedly compares the school to a private contractor that \"depends primarily on contracts to build roads, bridges, dams, ships, or submarines for the government.\"  Ante, at 840-841.  The New Perspectives School can be readily distinguished, however.  Although shipbuilders and dambuilders, like the school, may be dependent on government funds, they are not so closely supervised by the government.  And unlike most private contractors, the school is performing a statutory duty of the State.\n\n\n52\nThe majority also focuses on the fact that the actions at issue here are personnel decisions.  It would apparently concede that actions directly affecting the students could be treated as under color of state law, since the school is fulfilling the State's obligations to those children under Chapter 766.  It suggests, however, that the State has no interest in personnel decisions.  As I have suggested, I do not share this narrow view of the school's obligations;  the personnel decisions challenged here are related to the provision of Chapter 766 education.  In any event, since the school is funded almost entirely by the State, is closely supervised by the State, and exists solely to perform the State's statutory duty to educate children with special needs\u2014since the school is really just an arm of the State its personnel decisions may appropriately be considered state action.\n\nIII\n\n53\nEven though there are myriad indicia of state action in this case, the majority refuses to find that the school acted under color of state law when it discharged petitioners.  The decision in this case marks a return to empty formalism in state action doctrine.  Because I believe that the state action requirement must be given a more sensitive and flexible interpretation than the majority offers, I dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n Chapter 766, 1972 Mass.Acts, Mass.Gen.Laws Ann., ch. 71B, \u00a7 3 (West Supp.1981), requires school committees to identify students with special needs and to develop suitable educational programs for such students.  Massachusetts Gen.Laws Ann., ch. 71B, \u00a7 4 (West Supp.1981), provides that school committees may \"enter into an agreement with any public or private school, agency, or institution to provide the necessary special education\" for these students.  A student identified as having special needs and recommended for placement in private school may remain in public school, if his parents object to a placement in a particular private school, unless he is especially disruptive or dangerous. Parents who object to placement in a particular private school may also elect to place their child in a private school of their choice;  in such cases, they must pay the tuition.\n\n\n2\n Amicus curiae Massachusetts Association of 766 Approved Private Schools, Inc., of which the New Perspectives School is a member, informs the Court that many of its members have a student population which is more or less evenly divided between students referred and paid for by the State and students referred and paid for by their parents or guardians.  Brief as Amicus Curiae 3.\n\n\n3\n The record does not contain details of the school's contract with the Brookline School Committee.\n\n\n4\n Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides:\n\"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\"\n\n\n5\n The Fourteenth Amendment provides, in pertinent part:\n\"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. . . .\"\n\n\n6\n The Court has concluded that the acts of a private party are fairly attributable to the state on certain occasions when the private party acted in concert with state actors.  For example, in Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 155-156, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1607, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970), the issue was whether a restaurant violated \u00a7 1983 by refusing service to a white teacher who was in the company of six Negro students;  the town sheriff arrested the white teacher for vagrancy as a result of her request to be served lunch in their company.  The Court concluded that the restaurant acted under color of state law because it conspired with the sheriff, a state actor, in depriving the white teacher of federal rights.\nSimilarly, Flagg Brothers, Inc. v. Brooks, 436 U.S. 149, 98 S.Ct. 1729, 56 L.Ed.2d 185 (1978), and Lugar, 457 U.S. 922, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482, illustrate the relevance of whether action was taken in\nconcert with a state actor.  The issue in Flagg Brothers was whether a warehouseman could be sued under \u00a7 1983 because it sought to execute a lien by selling goods in its possession pursuant to \u00a7 7-210 of the New York Uniform Commercial Code. While the sale was authorized by a state statute, and hence appeared to be threatened under color of state law, the Court did not reach that issue.  Instead, it concluded that the warehouseman's decision to threaten to sell the goods was not \"properly attributable to the State of New York,\" 436 U.S., at 156, 98 S.Ct., at 1733, since no state actor was involved.  Since the respondent in Flagg Brothers claimed that the warehouseman violated her Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process and equal protection, and the Fourteenth Amendment is only offended by action of the state, we held that no claim for relief had been stated.\nIn Lugar, a lessee obtained an ex parte writ of attachment pursuant to a state statute, which was executed by a sheriff.  The Court held that \u00a7 1983 applied because the involvement of the sheriff distinguished the case from Flagg Brothers.  457 U.S., at 941, 102 S.Ct., at 2756.  The lessee thus acted under color of state law and the sheriff's involvement satisfied the state action requirement.\nThe limited role played by the Massachusetts Committee on Criminal Justice in the discharge of Rendell-Baker is not comparable to the role played by the public officials in Adickes and Lugar.  The uncontradicted evidence presented by the school showed that the Committee had the power only initially to review the qualifications of a counselor selected by the school to insure that the counselor met the requirements described in the school's grant application.  641 F.2d 14, 28 (1981).  The Committee had no power to hire or discharge a counselor who had the qualifications specified in the school's grant application.  Moreover, the Committee did not take any part in discharging Rendell-Baker;  on the contrary, it attempted to use leverage to aid her.  It requested an explanation for her discharge from the school and stated that it would not approve the appointment of a successor unless a grievance committee considered Rendell-Baker's case.  As the Court of Appeals correctly concluded, there is no evidence that the Committee had any authority to take even those steps. Ibid.\n\n\n7\n There is no evidence that the State has attempted to avoid its constitutional duties by a sham arrangement which attempts to disguise provision of public services as acts of private parties. Cf. Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296, 86 S.Ct. 486, 15 L.Ed.2d 373 (1966) (private trustees appointed to manage previously public park for white persons only).\n\n\n1\n The majority argues that the fact that the school receives almost all of its funds from the state is not enough, by itself, to justify a finding of state action.  It also contends that the fact that the school is closely supervised and heavily regulated is not enough, by itself, to justify such a finding.  Ante, at 840-842.  I am in general agreement with both propositions. However, when these two factors are present in the same case, and when other indicia of state action are also present, a finding of state action may very well be justified.  By analyzing the various indicia of state action separately, without considering their cumulative impact, the majority commits a fundamental error.  See also ante, at 842-843.\n\n\n2\n This Court has repeatedly recognized the unique role that education plays in American society.  See Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 221, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 2397, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982) (public education is not \"merely some governmental 'benefit' indistinguishable from other forms of social welfare legislation\");  Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 221, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1536, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972) (education is necessary to \"prepare citizens to participate effectively and intelligently in our open political system\");  Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 230, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 1575, 10 L.Ed.2d 844 (1963) (BRENNAN, J., concurring) (public education is a \"most vital civic institution for the preservation of a democratic system of government\");  Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 400, 43 S.Ct. 625, 627, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923) (\"The American people have always regarded education and acquisition of knowledge as matters of supreme importance\").\n\n\n3\n A State may not deliberately delegate a task to a private entity in order to avoid its constitutional obligations.  Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461, 73 S.Ct. 809, 97 L.Ed. 1152 (1953).  But a State's decision to delegate a duty to a private entity should be carefully examined even when it has acted, not in bad faith, but for reasons of convenience.  The doctrinal basis for the state action requirement is that exercises of state authority pose a special threat to constitutional values.  A private entity vested with state authority poses that threat just as clearly as a state agency.\n\n\n4\n This Court has previously emphasized the close relationship between teachers' free speech and the educational process.  See Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District, 439 U.S. 410, 99 S.Ct. 693, 58 L.Ed.2d 619 (1979);  Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968);  Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 87 S.Ct. 675, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967);  Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 81 S.Ct. 247, 5 L.Ed.2d 231 (1960).\nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts has recently promulgated regulations recognizing that the role of teachers of special needs students is not limited to course instruction.  These regulations provide:\n\"[T]he candidate will demonstrate that he or she:\n1. responds to the needs of individual students so as to enhance their self-esteem and development\n2. establishes constructive relationships with parents and others primarily concerned with the well-being of his or her students\n3. works to develop a learning environment which is favorable to openness of inquiry and devoid of ridicule.\"  603 Code Mass.Regs. \u00a7 7, \u00b6 7.04(40)(f) (1982).\n\n\n5\n In my view, this connection between the teacher's role and the provision of Chapter 766 education would justify a finding that the State had acted under color of state law, even if the school did not depend solely on Chapter 766 placements.  If the school had only one special needs student, and petitioners were discharged for criticizing the school's education of that child, a finding of state action might be justified.\n\n\n","label":1}

A hearing was held before an immigrant inspector who recommended deportation. The Acting Commissioner approved; and the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed.\n\n\n3\nWong Yang Sung then sought release from custody by habeas corpus proceedings in District Court for the District of Columbia, upon the sole ground that the administrative hearing was not conducted in conformity with \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 11 of the Administrative Procedure Act.1 The Government admitted noncompliance, but asserted that the Act did not apply. The court, after hearing, discharged the writ and remanded the prisoner to custody, holding the Administrative Procedure Act inapplicable to deportation hearings. 80 F.Supp. 235. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 84 U.S.App.D.C. 419, 174 F.2d 158. Prisoner's petition for certiorari was not opposed by the Government and, because the question presented has obvious importance in the administration of the immigration laws, we granted review. 338 U.S. 812, 70 S.Ct. 66.\n\nI.\n\n4\nThe Administrative Procedure Act of June 11, 1946, supra, is a new, basic and comprehensive regulation of procedures in many agencies, more than a few of which can advance arguments that its generalities should not or do not include them. Determination of questions of its coverage may well be approached through consideration of its purposes as disclosed by its background.\n\n\n5\nMultiplication of federal administrative agencies and expansion of their functions to include adjudications which have serious impact on private rights has been one of the dramatic legal developments of the past half-century.2 Partly from restriction by statute, partly from judicial self-restraint, and partly by necessity\u2014from the nature of their multitudinous and semilegislative or executive tasks\u2014the decisions of administrative tribunals were accorded considerable finality, and especially with respect to fact finding.3 The conviction developed, particularly within the legal profession, that this power was not sufficiently safeguarded and sometimes was put to arbitrary and biased use.4\n\n\n6\nConcern over administrative impartiality and response to growing discontent was reflected in Congress as early as 1929, when Senator Norris introduced a bill to create a separate administrative court.5 Fears and dissatisfactions increased as tribunals grew in number and jurisdiction, and a succession of bills offering various remedies appeared in Congress.6 Inquiries into the practices of state agencies, which tended to parallel or follow the federal pattern, were instituted in several states, and some studies noteworthy for thoroughness, impartiality and vision resulted.7\n\n\n7\nThe Executive Branch of the Federal Government also became concerned as to whether the structure and procedure of these bodies was conducive to fairness in the administrative process. President Roosevelt's Committee on Administrative Management in 1937 recommended complete separation of adjudicating functions and personnel from those having to do with investigation or prosecution.8 The President early in 1939 also directed the Attorney General to name 'a committee of eminent lawyers, jurists, scholars, and administrators to review the entire administrative process in the various departments of the executive Government and to recommend improvements, including the suggestion of any needed legislation.'9\n\n\n8\nSo strong was the demand for reform, however, that Congress did not await the Committee's report but passed what was known as the Walter-Logan bill, a comprehensive and rigid prescription of standardized procedures for administrative agencies.10 This bill was vetoed by President Roosevelt December 18, 1940,11 and the veto was sustained by the House.12 But the President's veto message made no denial of the need for reform. Rather it pointed out that the task of the Committee, whose objective was 'to suggest improvements to make the process more workable and more just,' had proved 'unexpectedly complex.' The President said, 'I should desire to await their report and recommendations before approving any measure in this complicated field.'13\n\n\n9\nThe committee devided in its views and both the majority and the minority submitted bills14 which were introduced in 1941. A subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee held exhaustive hearings on three proposed measures,15 but, before the gathering storm of national emergency and war, consideration of the problem was put aside. Though bills on the subject reappeared in 1944,16 they did not attract much attention.\n\n\n10\nThe McCarran-Sumners bill, which evolved into the present Act, was introduced in 1945.17 Its consideration and hearing, especially of agency interests, was painstaking. All administrative agencies were invited to submit their views in writing. A tentative revised bill was then prepared and interested parties again were invited to submit criticisms.18 The Attorney General named representatives of the Department of Justice to canvass the agencies and report their criticisms, and submitted a favorable report on the bill as finally revised.19 It passed both Houses without opposition and was signed by President Truman June 11, 1946.20\n\n\n11\nThe Act thus represents a long period of study and strife; it settles long-continued and hard-fought contentions, and enacts a formula upon which opposing social and political forces have come to rest. It contains many compromises and generalities and, no doubt, some ambiguities. Experience may reveal defects. But it would be a disservice to our form of government and to the administrative process itself if the courts should fail, so far as the terms of the Act warrant, to give effect to its remedial purposes where the evils it was aimed at appear.\n\nII.\n\n12\nOf the several administrative evils sought to be cured or minimized, only two are particularly relevant to issues before us today. One purpose was to introduce greater uniformity of procedure and standardization of administrative practice among the diverse agencies whose customs had departed widely from each other.21 We pursue this no further than to note that any exception we may find to its applicability would tend to defeat this purpose.\n\n\n13\nMore fundamental, however, was the purpose to curtail and change the practice of embodying in one person or agency the duties of prosecutor and judge. The President's Committee on Administrative Management voiced in 1937 the theme which, with variations in language, was reiterated throughout the legislative history of the Act. The Committee's report, which President Roosevelt transmitted to Congress with his approval as 'a great document of permanent importance,'22 said:\n\n\n14\n'* * * the independent commission is obliged to carry on judicial functions under conditions which threaten the impartial performance of that judicial work. The discretionary work of the administrator is merged with that of the judge. Pressures and influences properly enough directed toward officers responsible for formulating and administering policy constitute an unwholesome atmosphere in which to adjudicate private rights. But the mixed duties of the commissions render escape from these subversive influences impossible.\n\n\n15\n'Furthermore, the same men are obliged to serve both as prosecutors and as judges. This not only undermines judicial fairness; it weakens public confidence in that fairness. Commission decisions affecting private rights and conduct lie under the suspicion of being rationalizations of the preliminary findings which the commission, in the role of prosecutor, presented to itself.' Administrative Management in the Government of the United States, Report of the President's Committee on Administrative Management, 36\u201437 (1937).\n\n\n16\nThe Committee therefore recommended a redistribution of functions within the regulatory agencies. '(I)t would be divided into an administrative section and a judicial section' and the administrative section 'would formulate rules, initiate action, investigate complaints * * *' and the judicial section 'would sit as an impartial, independent body to make decisions affecting the public interest and private rights upon the basis of the records and findings presented to it by the administrative section.' Id. at 37.\n\n\n17\nAnother study was made by a distinguished committee named by the Secretary of Labor, whose jurisdiction at the time included the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Some of the committee's observations have relevancy to the procedure under examination here. It said: 'The inspector who presides over the formal hearing is in many respects comparable to a trial judge. He has, at a minimum, the function of determining\u2014subject to objection on the alien's behalf what goes into the written record upon which decision ultimately is to be based. Under the existing practice he has also the function of counsel representing the moving party\u2014he does not merely admit evidence against the alien; he has the responsibility of seeing that such evidence is put into the record. The precise scope of his appropriate functions is the first question to be considered.' The Secretary of Labor's Committee on Administrative Procedure, The Immigration and Naturalization Service, 77 (Mimeo. 1940).\n\nFurther:\n\n18\n'Merely to provide that in particular cases different inspectors shall investigate and hear is an insufficient guarantee of insulation and independence of the presiding official. The present organization of the field staff not only gives work of both kinds commonly to the same inspector but tends toward an identity of viewpoint as between inspectors who are chiefly doing only one or the other kind of work. * * *\n\n\n19\n'* * * We recommend that the presiding inspectors be relieved of their present duties of presenting the case against aliens and be confirmed (sic) entirely to the duties customary for a judge. This, of course, would require the assignment of another officer to perform the task of a prosecuting attorney. The appropriate officer for this purpose would seem to be the investigating inspector who, having prepared the case against the alien, is already thoroughly familiar with it. * * * 'A genuinely impartial hearing, conducted with critical detachment, is psychologically improbable if not impossible, when the presiding officer has at once the responsibility of appraising the strength of the case and of seeking to make it as strong as possible. Nor is complete divorce between investigation and hearing possible so long as the presiding inspector has the duty himself of assembling and presenting the results of the investigation. * * *' Id. at 81\u201482.\n\n\n20\nAnd the Attorney General's Committee on Administrative Procedure, which divided as to the appropriate remedy,23 was unanimous that this evil existed. Its Final Report said: 'These types of commingling of functions of investigation or advocacy with the function of deciding are thus plainly undesirable. But they are also avoidable and should be avoided by appropriate internal division of labor. For the disqualifications produced by investigation or advocacy are personal psychological ones which result from engaging in those types of activity; and the problem is simply one of isolating those who engage in the activity. Creation of independent hearing commissioners insulated from all phases of a case other than hearing and deciding will, the Committee believes, go far toward solving this problem at the level of the initial hearing provided the proper safeguards are established to assure the insulation. * * *' Rep. Atty. Gen. Comm. Ad. Proc. 56 (1941), S. Doc. No. 8, 77th Cong., 1st Sess. 56 (1941).\n\n\n21\nThe Act before us adopts in general this recommended form of remedial action. A minority of the Committee had, furthermore, urged an even more thoroughgoing separation and supported it with a cogent report. Id., at 203 et seq.\n\n\n22\nSuch were the evils found by disinterested and competent students. Such were the facts before Congress which gave impetus to the demand for the reform which this Act was intended to accomplish. It is the plain duty of the courts, regardless of their views of the wisdom or policy of the Act, to construe this remedial legislation to eliminate, so far as its text permits, the practices it condems.\n\nIII.\n\n23\nTurning now to the case before us, we find the administrative hearing a perfect exemplification of the practices so unanimously condemned.\n\n\n24\nThis hearing, which followed the uniform practice of the Immigration Service,24 was before an immigrant inspector, who, for purposes of the hearing, is called the 'presiding inspector.' Except with consent of the alien, the presiding inspector may not be the one who investigated the case. 8 C.F.R. 150.6(b).25 But the inspector's duties include investigation of like cases; and while he is today hearing cases investigated by a colleague, tomorrow his investigation of a case may be heard before the inspector whose case he passes on today. An 'examining inspector' may be designated to conduct the prosecution, 8 C.F.R. 150.6(n), but none was in this case; and, in any event, the examining inspector also has the same mixed prosecutive and hearing functions. The presiding inspector, when no examining inspector is present, is required to 'conduct the interrogation of the alien and the witnesses in behalf of the Government and shall cross-examine the alien's witnesses and present such evidence as is necessary to support the charges in the warrant of arrest.' 8 C.F.R. 150.6(b). It may even become his duty to lodge an additional charge against the alien and proceed to hear his own accusation in like mammer. 8 C.F.R. 150.6(1). Then, as soon as practicable, he is to prepare a summary of the evidence, proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a proposed order. A copy is furnished the alien or his counsel, who may file exceptions and brief, 8 C.F.R. 150.7, whereupon the whole is forwarded to the Commissioner. 8 C.F.R. 150.9.\n\n\n25\nThe Administrative Procedure Act did not go so far as to require a complete separation of investigating and prosecuting functions from adjudicating functions. But that the safeguards it did set up were intended to ameliorate the evils from the commingling of functions as exemplified here is beyond doubt. And this commingling, if objectionable anywhere, would seem to be particularly so in the deportation proceedings, where we frequently meet with a voteless class of litigants who not only lack the influence of citizens, but who are strangers to the laws and customs in which they find themselves involved and who often do not even understand the tongue in which they are accused. Nothing in the nature of the parties or proceedings suggests that we should strain to exempt deportation proceedings from reforms in administrative procedure applicable generally to federal agencies.\n\n\n26\nNor can we accord any weight to the argument that to apply the Act to such hearings will cause inconvenience and added expense to the Immigration Service. Of course it will, as it will to nearly every agency to which it is applied. But the power of the purse belongs to Congress, and Congress has determined that the price for greater fairness is not too high. The agencies, unlike the aliens, have ready and persuasive access to the legislative ear and if error is made by including them, relief from Congress is a simple matter.\n\n\n27\nThis brings us to contentions both parties have advanced based on the pendency in Congress of bills to exempt this agency from the Act. Following an adverse decision,26 the Department asked Congress for exempting legislation,27 which appropriate committees of both Houses reported favorably but in different form and substance.28 Congress adjourned without further action. The Government argues that Congress knows that the Immigration Service has construed the Act as not applying to deportation proceedings, and that it 'has taken no action indicating disagreement with that interpretation'; that therefore it 'is at least arguable that Congress was prepared to specifically confirm the administrative construction by clarifying legislation.' We do not think we can draw that inference from incompleted steps in the legislative process. Cf. Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U.S. 106, 119\u2014120, 60 S.Ct. 444, 451, 84 L.Ed. 604, 125 A.L.R. 1368.\n\n\n28\nOn the other hand, we will not draw the inference, urged by petitioner, that an agency admits that it is acting upon a wrong construction by seeking ratification from Congress. Public policy requires that agencies feel free to ask legislation which will terminate or avoid adverse contentions and litigations. We do not feel justified in holding that a request for and failure to get in a single session of Congress clarifying legislation on a genuinely debatable point of agency procedure admits weakness in the agency's contentions. We draw, therefore, no inference in favor of either construction of the Act\u2014from the Department's request for legislative clarification, from the congressional committees' willingness to consider it, or from Congress' failure to enact it.\n\n\n29\nWe come, then, to examination of the text of the Act to determine whether the Government is right in its contentions: first, that the general scope of \u00a7 5 of the Act does not cover deportation proceedings; and, second, that even if it does, the proceedings are excluded from the requirements of the Act by virtue of \u00a7 7.\n\nIV.\n\n30\nThe Administrative Procedure Act, \u00a7 5, establishes a number of formal requirements to be applicable 'In every case of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.' The argument here depends upon the words 'adjudication required by statute.' The Government contends that there is no express requirement for any hearing or adjudication in the statute authorizing deportation,29 and that this omission shields these proceedings from the impact of \u00a7 5. Petitioner, on the other hand, contends that deportation hearings, though not expressly required by statute, are required under the decisions of this Court,30 and the proceedings, therefore, are within the scope of \u00a7 5.\n\n\n31\nBoth parties invoke many citations to legislative history as to the meaning given to these key words by the framers, advocates or opponents of the Administrative Procedure Act. Because \u00a7 5 in the original bill applied to hearings required 'by law,'31 because it was suggested by the Attorney General that it should be changed to 'required by statute or Constitution,'32 and because it finally emerged 'required by statute,' the Government argues that the section is intended to apply only when explicit statutory words granting a right to adjudication can be pointed out. Petitioner on the other hand cites references which would indicate that the limitation to statutory hearing was merely to avoid creating by inference a new right to hearings where no right existed otherwise. We do not know. The legislative history is more conflicting than the text is ambiguous.\n\n\n32\nBut the difficulty with any argument premised on the proposition that the deportation statute does not require a hearing is that, without such hearing, there would be no constitutional authority for deportation. The constitutional requirement of procedural due process of law derives from the same source as Congress' power to legislate and, where applicable, permeates every valid enactment of that body. It was under compulsion of the Constitution that this Court long ago held that an antecedent deportation statute must provide a hearing at least for aliens who had not entered clandestinely and who had been here some time even if illegally. The Court said: 'This is the reasonable construction of the acts of Congress here in question, and they need not be otherwise interpreted. In the case of all acts of Congress, such interpretation ought to be adopted as, without doing violence to the import of the words used, will bring them into harmony with the Constitution.' The Japanese Immigrant Case (Yamataya v. Fisher), 189 U.S. 86, 101, 23 S.Ct. 611, 615, 47 L.Ed. 721.\n\n\n33\nWe think that the limitation to hearings 'required by statute' in \u00a7 5 of the Administrative Procedure Act exempts from that section's application only those hearings which administrative agencies may hold by regulation, rule, custom, or special dispensation; not those held by compulsion. We do not think the limiting words render the Administrative Procedure Act inapplicable to hearings, the requirement for which has been read into a statute by the Court in order to save the statute from invalidity. The exempt hearings of less than statutory authority, not those of more than statutory authority. We would hardly attribute to Congress a purpose to be less scrupulous about the fairness of a hearing necessitated by the Constitution than one granted by it as a matter of expediency.\n\n\n34\nIndeed, to so construe the Immigration Act might again bring it into constitutional jeopardy. When the Constitution requires a hearing, it requires a fair one, one before a tribunal which meets at least currently prevailing standards of impartiality. A deportation hearing involves issues basic to human liberty and happiness and, in the present upheavals in lands to which aliens may be returned, perhaps to life itself. It might be difficult to justify as measuring up to constitutional standards of impartiality a hearing tribunal for deportation proceedings the like of which has been condemned by Congress as unfair even where less vital matters of property rights are at stake.\n\n\n35\nWe hold that the Administrative Procedure Act, \u00a7 5, does cover deportation proceedings conducted by the Immigration Service.\n\nV.\n\n36\nThe remaining question is whether the exception of \u00a7 7(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act exempts deportation hearings held before immigrant inspectors. It provides:\n\n\n37\n'Sec. 7. In hearings which section 4 or 5 requires to be conducted pursuant to this section\u2014\n\n\n38\n'(a) Presiding Officers.\u2014There shall preside at the taking of evidence (1) the agency, (2) one or more members of the body which comprises the agency, or (3) one or more examiners appointed as provided in this Act; but nothing in this Act shall be deemed to supersede the conduct of specified classes of proceedings in whole or part by or before boards or other officers specially provided for by or designated pursuant to statute. * * *' 60 Stat. 237, 241, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1006, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1006.\n\n\n39\nThe Government argues that immigrant inspectors are 'specially provided for by or designated pursuant to' \u00a7 16 of the Immigration Act, which, in pertinent part, reads: '* * * The inspection * * * of aliens, including those seeking admission or readmission to or the privilege of passing through or residing in the United States, and the examination of aliens arrested within the United States under this Act,33 shall be conducted by immigrant inspectors, except as hereinafter provided in regard to boards of special inquiry. * * * Said inspectors shall have power to administer oaths and to take and consider evidence touching the right of any alien to enter, reenter, pass through, or reside in the United States, and, where such action may be necessary, to make a written record of such evidence; * * *' 39 Stat. 874, 885, as amended, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 152, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152.\n\n\n40\nCertainly nothing here specifically provides that immigrant inspectors shall conduct deportation hearings or be designated to do so. This language does direct them to conduct border inspections of aliens seeking admission. They may administer oaths and take, record, and consider evidence. But these functions are indispensable to investigations which are concededly within their competence. And these functions are likewise necessary to enable the preparation of complaints for prosecutive purposes. But that Congress by grant of these powers has specially constituted them or provided for their designation as hearing officers in deportation proceedings does not appear.\n\n\n41\nSection 7(a) qualifies as presiding officers at hearings the agency and one or more of the members of the body comprising the agency, and it also leaves untouched any others whose responsibilities and duties as hearing officers are established by other statutory provision. But if hearings are to be had before employees whose responsibility and authority derives from a lesser source, they must be examiners whose independence and tenure are so guarded by the Act as to give the assurances of neutrality which Congress thought would guarantee the impartiality of the administrative process.\n\n\n42\nWe find no basis in the purposes, history or text of this Act for judicially declaring an exemption in favor of deportation proceedings from the procedural safeguards enacted for general application to administrative agencies. We hold that deportation proceedings must conform to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act if resulting orders are to have validity. Since the proceeding in the case before us did not comply with these requirements, we sustain the writ of habeas corpus and direct release of the prisoner.\n\n\n43\nReversed.\n\n\n44\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice CLARK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n45\nMr. Justice REED, dissenting.\n\n\n46\nThe Court, it seems to me, has disregarded a congressional exemption of certain agencies, including the Immigration and Naturalization Service, from some of the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. Such judicial intrusion into the legislative domain justifies a protest. It may be useful to call attention to the necessity of recognizing specific exceptions to general rules. This protest is rested on the ground that immigrant inspectors performing duties under \u00a7 16 of the Immigration Act are within the exception provided by \u00a7 7(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Court's opinion discusses this point under subdivision V. The sections are there set out and can be examined by the reader.\n\n\n47\nIn this case no one questions the constitutionality of the hearing Wong received before the immigrant inspector, with administrative review by the Commissioner and the Board of Immigration Appeals. The question on which I disagree with the Court is whether the Administrative Procedure Act permits an inspector of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to serve as a presiding officer at a deportation hearing.\n\n\n48\nSection 7(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act provides that the official presiding at the taking of evidence shall be an agency, an agency member or an examiner appointed under that Act. There is an exception to this requirement. It reads as follows: 'but nothing in this Act shall be deemed to supersede the conduct of specified classes of proceedings in whole or part by or before boards or other officers specially provided for by or designated pursuant to statute.' It is this exception that made it proper for an immigrant inspector to preside at this deportation hearing.\n\n\n49\nUnder \u00a7 16 of the Immigration Act, 39 Stat. 874, 885, the 'inspection * * * of aliens, including those seeking admission or readmission to or the privilege of passing through or residing in the United States, and the examination of aliens arrested within the United States under this Act, shall be conducted by immigrant inspectors * * *. Said inspectors shall have power to administer oaths and to take and consider evidence touching the right of any alien to enter, reenter, pass through, or reside in the United States, and, where such action may be necessary, to make a written record of such evidence; * * *.' It seems to me obvious that the exception provided in \u00a7 7(a) covers immigrant inspectors dealing with the arrest of an alien for violation of the Immigration Act. The examination of arrested aliens at a deportation proceeding is surely a specified class of proceedings under \u00a7 7(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act, and it is surely conducted by an officer 'specially provided for by * * * statute.'\n\n\n50\nThe reason for the exception in \u00a7 7(a) was not spelled out in the legislative history or in the Act itself. The exception may have been made to retain smoothness of operation in the several agencies where there were officials specially provided for by statute or designated pursuant to a statute. When making exceptions from the requirements as to separation of the investigatory and adjudicatory functions, it was natural to include officers specially designated by statute to sit in judgment. Agency members are excluded from these requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. They, too, have investigatory and adjudicatory duties. Since the members of the agency and the statutorily designated officers were specially selected for the functions they were to perform, Congress probably reposed confidence in their experience and expertness. It doubtless did not wish to disorganize administration until time showed whether that confidence was well placed.1\n\n\n51\nSince the Court does not accept my view of the reach of \u00a7 7(a), it would be useless to undertake an analysis of the other questions presented by the petition for certiorari.\n\n\n\n1\n Particularly invoked are \u00a7 5(c), 60 Stat. 237, 240, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1004(c), 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1004(c), which provides in part: 'The same officers who preside at the reception of evidence pursuant to section 7 shall make the recommended decision or initial decision required by section 8 except where such officers become unavailable to the agency. Save to the extent required for the disposition of ex parte matters as authorized by law, no such officer shall consult any person or party on any fact in issue unless upon notice and opportunity for all parties to participate; nor shall such officer be responsible to or subject to the supervision or direction of any officer, employee, or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions for any agency. No officer, employee, or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions for any agency in any case shall, in that or a factually related case, participate or advise in the decision, recommended decision, or agency review pursuant to section 8 except as witness or counsel in public proceedings. * * *'; and \u00a7 11, 60 Stat. at page 244, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1010, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1010, which provides in part: 'Subject to the civil-service and other laws to the extent not inconsistent with this Act, there shall be appointed by and for each agency as many qualified and competent examiners as may be necessary for proceedings pursuant to sections 7 and 8, who shall be assigned to cases in rotation so far as practicable and shall perform no duties inconsistent with their duties and responsibilities as examiners. Examiners shall be removable by the agency in which they are employed only for good cause established and determined by the Civil Service Commission (hereinafter called the Commission) after opportunity for hearing and upon the record thereof. Examiners shall receive compensation prescribed by the Commission independently of agency recommendations or ratings and in accordance with the Classification Act of 1923, as amended, except that the provisions of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (b) of section 7 of said Act, as amended, and the provisions of section 9 of said Act, as amended, shall not be applicable. * * *'\n\n\n2\n See e.g., Blachly and Oatman, Administrative Legislation and Adjudication 1 (1934); Landis, The Administrative Process 1 (1938); Pound, Administrative Law 27 (1942); Carrow, Background of Administrative Law 1 (1948); The Federal Administrative Procedure Act and the Administrative Agencies 4 (N.Y.U.1947); Final Report of Attorney General's Committee on Administrative Procedure 7 (1941), contained in S.

Sand, Washington, D.C., for the petitioner.\nMr. David Carliner, Washington, D.C., for the respondents.\nMr. Justice CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis is a companion case to Leng May Ma v. Barber, 357 U.S. 185, 78 S.Ct. 1072. The five respondents are natives of China who came to the United States seeking admission between 1949 and 1954, four of them arriving before the effective date of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Like petitioner in Leng May Ma, all were paroled into the United States, and all have been ordered excluded. They applied for stays of deportation under \u00a7 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,1 and upon refusal, filed complaints in the District Court seeking judgments declaring their nondeportability to China, directing considerarion of their claims under \u00a7 243(h), and restraining the Attorney General from deporting them. The complaints were dismissed by the District Court, but the Court of Appeals held that excluded aliens on parole are 'within the United States' for purposes of \u00a7 243(h), 101 U.S.App.D.C. 229, 248 F.2d 89. Because of the conflict with the Ninth Circuit's decision in Leng May Ma, we granted certiorari. 1957, 355 U.S. 861, 78 S.Ct. 95, 2 L.Ed.2d 67. We have concluded that respondents, like petitioner in Leng May Ma, are ineligible for stays of deportation under \u00a7 243(h). However, because of the importance of this problem in the administration of the immigration laws, we deem it appropriate to deal specifically with a contention not directly asserted by petitioner in Leng May Ma.\n\n\n2\nThe deportation of excluded aliens under the Immigration and Nationality Act is authorized in \u00a7 237(a) of Chapter 4, wherein it is provided that an alien excluded under the Act 'shall be immediately deported to the country whence he came * * *.' 66 Stat. 201, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1227(a). A similar provision existed in the immediate predecessor to \u00a7 237(a), which was \u00a7 18 of the Immigration Act of 1917.2 Deportation in expulsion proceedings is separately provided for under the present Act in \u00a7 243 of Chapter 5, subsection (h) of which, of course, contains the authority which respondents seek to invoke in this case. 66 Stat. 212, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1253. Like authority existed in the immediate predecessor of \u00a7 243, which was \u00a7 20 of the Immigration Act of 1917, 39 Stat. 890, as amended by \u00a7 23 of the Internal Security Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 1010.\n\n\n3\nRespondents assert, however, that neither \u00a7 237(a) nor its predecessor, \u00a7 18 of the 1917 Act, is the basis for their deportation since they were not 'immediately' deported as required in the sections. Hence, they argue that deportation must rest upon \u00a7 243 of the present Act, as to the respondent who arrived after the Immigration and Nationality Act, and its predecessor, \u00a7 20 of the 1917 Act, as to the four who arrived prior to the present Act.\n\n\n4\nWe will assume, for purpose of analysis, that four of the five respondents are, as they claim, deportable only under prior Acts by virtue of their early arrival. However, under neither of the exclusion sections, i.e., \u00a7 237(a) of the present Act or \u00a7 18 of the 1917 Act, is the deportation authority confined, as respondents contend, to those situations where deportation is immediate. Neither section, when read in its entirety and in context, fairly suggests any such limitation. Nor are there reasons of policy to compel such a result. As the desie to remain increases, those knocking on our doors quite naturally become more litigious, and contested departures often involve long delays. We doubt that the Congress intended the mere fact of delay to improve an alien's status from that of one seeking admission to that of one legally considered within the United States. We conclude that there is ample basis under \u00a7 237(a) and \u00a7 18 of the 1917 Act to deport respondents; we need not draw upon the provisions in \u00a7 243 of the present Act or \u00a7 20 of the 1917 Act.\n\n\n5\nRegardless of which of the two exclusion sectons, \u00a7 237(a) of the 1952 Act or \u00a7 18 of the 1917 Act, provides the basis for respondents' deportation, the applications for stays were all filed subsequent to the 1952 Act and hence must be determined by that Act. For reasons explained in Leng May Ma, \u00a7 243(h) is unavailable to excluded aliens, and the fact of parole creates no variance from this principle.\n\n\n6\nReversed.\n\n\n7\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, and Mr. Justice BRENNAN dissent for the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion in Leng May Ma v. Barber, 357 U.S. 190, 78 S.Ct. 1075.\n\n\n\n1\n Section 243(h): 'The Attorney General is authorized to withhold deportation of any alien within the United States to any country in which in his opinion the alien would be subject to physical persencution and for such period of time as he deems to be necessary for such reason.' 66 Stat. 214, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1253(h).\n\n\n2\n Section 18: '(A)ll aliens brought to this country in violation of law shall be immediately sent back * * *.' 39 Stat. 887.\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"391 U.S. 404\n88 S.Ct. 1705\n20 L.Ed.2d 697\nMENOMINEE TRIBE OF INDIANS, Petitioner,v.UNITED STATES.\nNo. 187.\nReargued April 26, 1968.\nDecided May 27, 1968.\n\nCharles A. Hobbs, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nLouis F. Claiborne, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nBronson C. LaFollette, Madison, Wis., for State of Wisconsin, as amicus curiae, at the invitation of the Court.\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe Menominee Tribe of Indians was granted a reservation in Wisconsin by the Treaty of Wolf River in 1854. 10 Stat. 1064. By this treaty the Menominees retroceded certain lands they had acquired under an earlier treaty and the United States confirmed to them the Wolf River Reservation 'for a home, to be held as Indian lands are held.' Nothing was said in the 1854 treaty about hunting and fishing rights. Yet we agree with the Court of Claims1 that the language 'to be held as Indian lands are held' includes the right to fish and to hunt. The record shows that the lands covered by the Wolf River Treaty of 1854 were selected precisely because they had an abundance of game. See Menominee Tribe of Indians v. United States, 95 Ct.Cl. 232, 240\u2014241 (1941). The essence of the Treaty of Wolf River was that the Indians were authorized to maintain on the new lands ceded to them as a reservation their way of life which included hunting and fishing.2\n\n\n2\nWhat the precise nature and extent of those hunting and fishing rights were we need not at this time determine. For the issue tendered by the present decision of the Court of Claims, 388 F.2d 998, 179 Ct.Cl. 496, is whether those rights, whatever their precise extent, have been extinguished.\n\n\n3\nThat issue arose because, beginning in 1962, Wisconsin took the position that the Menominees were subject to her hunting and fishing regulations. Wisconsin prosecuted three Menominees for violating those regulations and the Wisconsin Supreme Court held3 that the state regulations were valid, as the hunting and fishing rights of the Menominees had been abrogated by Congress in the Menominee Indian Termination Act of 1954. 68 Stat. 250, as amended, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 891\u2014902.\n\n\n4\nThereupon the tribe brought suit in the Court of Claims against the United States to recover just compensation for the loss of those hunting and fishing rights.4 The Court of Claims by a divided vote held that the tribe possessed hunting and fishing rights under the Wolf River Treaty; but it held, contrary to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, that those rights were not abrogated by the Termination Act of 1954. We granted the petition for a writ of certiorari in order to resolve that conflict between the two courts. 389 U.S. 811, 88 S.Ct. 51, 19 L.Ed.2d 67. On oral argument both petitioner and respondent urged that the judgment of the Court of Claims be affirmed. The State of Wisconsin appeared as amicus curiae and argued that that judgment be reversed.\n\n\n5\nIn 1953 Congress by concurrent resolution5 instructed the Secretary of the Interior to recommend legislation for the withdrawal of federal supervision over certain American Indian tribes, including the Menominees. Several bills were offered, one for the Menominee Tribe that expressly preserved hunting and fishing rights.6 But the one that became the Termination Act of 1954, viz., H.R. 2828, did not mention hunting and fishing rights. Moreover, counsel for the Menominees spoke against the bill, arguing that its silence would by implication abolish those hunting and fishing rights.7 It is therefore argued that they were abolished by the Termination Act.\n\n\n6\nThe purpose of the 1954 Act was by its terms 'to provide for orderly termination of Federal supervision over the property and members' of the tribe. Under its provisions, the tribe was to formulate a plan for future control of tribal property and service functions theretofore conducted by the United States. On or before April 30, 1961, the Secretary was to transfer to a tribal corporation or to a trustee chosen by him all property real and personal held in trust for the tribe by the United States.8\n\n\n7\nThe Menominees submitted a plan, looking toward the creation of a county in Wisconsin out of the former reservation and the creation by the Indians of a Wisconsin corporation to hold other property of the tribe and its members. The Secretary of the Interior approved the plan9 with modifications; the Menominee Enterprises, Inc., was incorporated;10 and numerous ancillary laws were passed by Wisconsin integrating the former reservation into its county system of government. The Termination Act provided that after the transfer by the Secretary of title to the property of the tribe, all federal supervision was to end and 'the laws of the several States shall apply to the tribe and its members in the same manner as they apply to other citizens or persons within their jurisdiction.'\n\n\n8\nIt is therefore argued with force that the Termination Act of 1954, which became fully effective in 1961, submitted the hunting and fishing rights of the Indians to state regulation and control. We reach, however, the opposite conclusion. The same Congress that passed the Termination Act also passed Public Law 280, 67 Stat. 588, as amended, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1162. The latter came out of the same committees of the Senate and the House as did the Termination Act; and it was amended11 in a way that is critical here only two months after the Termination Act became law. As amended, Public Law 280 granted designated States, including Wisconsin, jurisdiction 'over offenses committed by or against Indians in the areas of Indian country' named in the Act, which in the case of Wisconsin was described as 'All Indian country within the State,' But Public Law 280 went on to say that 'Nothing in this section * * * shall deprive any Indian or any Indian tribe, band, or community of any right, privilege, or immunity afforded under Federal treaty, agreement, or statute with respect to hunting, trapping, or fishing or the control, licensing, or regulation thereof.' (Emphasis added.) That provision on its face contains no limitation; it protects any hunting, trapping, or fishing right granted by a federal treaty. Public Law 280, as amended, became the law in 1954, nearly seven years before the Termination Act became fully effective in 1961. In 1954, when Public Law 280 became effective, the Menominee Reservation was still 'Indian country' within the meaning of Public Law 280.\n\n\n9\nPublic Law 280 must therefore be considered in pari materia with the Termination Act. The two Acts read together mean to us that, although federal supervision of the tribe was to cease and all tribal property was to be transferred to new hands, the hunting and fishing rights granted or preserved by the Wolf River Treaty of 185412 survived the Termination Act of 1954.\n\n\n10\nThis construction is in accord with the overall legislative plan. The Termination Act by its terms provided for the 'orderly termination of Federal supervision over the property and members' of the tribe. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 891. (Emphasis added.) The Federal Government ceded to the State of Wisconsin its power of supervision over the tribe and the reservation lands, as evident from the provision of the Termination Act that the laws of Wisconsin 'shall apply to the tribe and its members in the same manner as they apply to other citizens or persons within (its) jurisdiction.'\n\n\n11\nThe provision of the Termination Act (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 899) that 'all statutes of the United States which affect Indians because of their status as Indians shall no longer be applicable to the members of the tribe' plainly refers to the termination of federal supervision. The use of the word 'statutes' is potent evidence that no treaty was in mind.\n\n\n12\nWe decline to construe the Termination Act as a backhanded way a abrogating the hunting and fishing rights of these Indians. While the power to abrogate those rights exists (see Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U.S. 553, 564\u2014567, 23 S.Ct. 216, 220\u2014222, 47 L.Ed. 299) 'the intention to abrogate or modify a treaty is not to be lightly imputed to the Congress.' Pigeon River, etc., Co. v. Charles W. Cox, Limited, 291 U.S. 138, 160, 54 S.Ct. 361, 367, 78 L.Ed. 695. See also Squire v. Capoeman, 351 U.S. 1, 76 S.Ct. 611, 100 L.Ed. 883.\n\n\n13\nOur conclusion is buttressed by the remarks of the legislator chiefly responsible for guiding the Termination Act to enactment, Senator Watkins, who stated upon the occasion of the signing of the bill that it 'in no way violates any treaty obligation with this tribe.'13\n\n\n14\nWe find it difficult to believe that Congress, without explicit statement, would subject the United States to a claim for compensation14 by destroying a property rights conferred by treaty, particularly when Congress was purporting by the Termination Act to settle the Government's financial obligations toward the Indians.15\n\n\n15\nAccordingly the judgment of the Court of Claims is affirmed.\n\n\n16\nAffirmed.\n\n\n17\nMr. Justice MARSHALL took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n18\nMr. Justice STEWART, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK joins, dissenting.\n\n\n19\nBy the Treaty of Wolf River in 1854, 10 Stat. 1064, the United States granted to the Menominee Tribe of Indians a reservation 'to be held as Indian lands are held.' As the Court says, this language unquestionably conferred special hunting and fishing rights within the boundaries of the reservation. One hundred years later, in the Menominee Indian Termination Act of 1954, 68 Stat. 250, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 891\u2014902, Congress provided for the termination of the reservation and the transfer of title to a tribal corporation. The Act provided that upon termination of the reservation,\n\n\n20\n'(T)he laws of the several States shall apply to the tribe      and its members in the same manner as they apply to other      citizens or persons within their jurisdiction.' 25 U.S.C. \u00a7      899.1\n\n\n21\nThe reservation was formally terminated on April 30, 1961, seven years after the Termination Act, and the State of Wisconsin has ever since subjected the Menominees, just as any other citizens, to its hunting and fishing regulations. State v. Sanapaw, 21 Wis.2d 377, 124 N.W.2d 41.\n\n\n22\nThe Menominees instituted this proceeding against the United States, asking compensation for the taking of their special rights. Shoshone Tribe, etc. v. United States, 299 U.S. 476, 57 S.Ct. 244, 81 L.Ed. 360. The Court of Claims denied compensation on the ground that the Termination Act had not in fact extinguished those rights, and that they remained immune from regulation by Wisconsin. The Court today agrees. I do not.\n\n\n23\nThe statute is plain on its face: after termination the Memominees are fully subject to state laws just as other citizens are, and no exception is made for hunting and fishing laws. Nor does the legislative history contain any indication that Congress intended to say anything other than what the unqualified words of the statute express.2 In fact two bills which would have explicitly preserved hunting and fishing rights3 were rejected in favor of the bill ultimately adopted4\u2014a bill which was opposed by counsel for the Menominees because it failed to preserve their treaty rights.5\n\n\n24\nThe Court today holds that the Termination Act does not mean what it says. The Court's reason for reaching this remarkable result is that it finds 'in pari materia' another statute which, I submit, has nothing whatever to do with this case.\n\n\n25\nThat statute, Public Law 280, 67 Stat. 588, as amended, 68 Stat. 795, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1162 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1360, granted to certain States, including Wisconsin, general jurisdiction over 'Indian country' within their boundaries.6 Several exceptions to the general grant were enumerated, including an exception from the grant of criminal jurisdiction for treaty-based hunting and fishing rights. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1162(b). But this case does not deal with state jurisdiction over Indian country; it deals with state jurisdiction over Indians after Indian country has been terminated. Whereas Public Law 280 provides for the continuation of the special hunting and fishing rights while a reservation exists, the Termination Act provides for the applicability of all state laws without exception after the reservation has disappeared.7\n\n\n26\nThe Termination Act by its very terms provides:\n\n\n27\n'(A)ll statutes of the United States which affect Indians      because of their status as Indians shall no longer be      applicable to the members of the tribe * * *.' 25 U.S.C. \u00a7      899.\n\n\n28\nPublic Law 280 is such a statute. It has no application to the Menominees now that their reservation is gone.8\n\n\n29\nThe 1854 Treaty granted the Menominees special hunting and fishing rights. The 1954 Termination Act, by subjecting the Menominees without exception to state law, took away those rights. The Menominees are entitled to compensation.\n\n\n30\nI would reverse the judgment of the Court of Claims.\n\n\n\n1\n Menominee Tribe of Indians v. United States, 388 F.2d 998, 1002, 179 Ct.Cl. 496, 503\u2014504.\n\n\n2\n As stated by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin:\n'It would seem unlikely that the Menominees would have knowingly relinquished their special fishing and hunting rights which they enjoyed on their own lands, and have accepted in exchange other lands with respect to which such rights did not extend. They undoubtedly believed that these rights were guaranteed to them when these other lands were ceded to them 'to be held as Indian lands are held.' Construing this ambiguous provision of the 1854 treaty favorably to the Menominees, we determine that they enjoyed the same exclusive hunting rights free from the restrictions of the state's game laws over the ceded lands, which comprised the Menominee Indian Reservation, as they had enjoyed over the lands ceded to the United States by the 1848 treaty.' State v. Sanapaw, 21 Wis.2d 377, 383, 124 N.W.2d 41, 44 (1963).\nThe Court said in United States v. Winans, 198 U.S. 371, 380 381, 25 S.Ct. 662, 664, 49 L.Ed. 1089, '(W)e will construe a treaty with the Indians as 'that unlettered people' understood it, and 'as justice and reason demand, in all cases where power is exerted by the strong over those to whom they owe care and protection,' and counterpoise the inequality 'by the superior justice which looks only to the substance of the right, without regard to technical rules.\"\nAs the Solicitor General points out in his brief, the words 'to be held as Indian lands are held' sum up in a single phrase the familiar provisions of earlier treaties which recognized hunting and fishing as normal incidents of Indian life. See Treaty of January 3, 1786, with the Choctaws, 7 Stat. 22; Treaty of January 31, 1786, with the Shawnees, 7 Stat. 27; Treaty of January 9, 1789, with the Wyandots, 7 Stat. 29; Treaty of August 3, 1795, with the Wyandots, 7 Stat. 52; Treaty of November 10, 1808, with the Osages, 7 Stat. 109; Treaty of August 24, 1835, with the Comanches, 7 Stat. 475.\n\n\n3\n State v. Sanapaw, 21 Wis.2d 377, 124 N.W.2d 41.\n\n\n4\n See Shoshone Tribe, etc. v. United States, 299 U.S. 476, 57 S.Ct. 244, 81 L.Ed. 360.\n\n\n5\n H.R.Con.Res. 108, 83d Cong., 1st Sess., 67 Stat.

The roll was closed in December 1957. 22 Fed.Reg. 9951.\n\n\n9\n 26 Fed.Reg. 3726.\n\n\n10\n Wisconsin questions whether Menominee Enterprises, Inc., to which all tribal assets were conveyed pursuant to the termination plan (26 Fed.Reg. 3726), should be viewed as the successor entity to the tribe and the present holder of the hunting and fishing rights, and, if so, to what extent the corporation or the tribal members thereof can withhold or parcel out these rights.\nThe Menominees, on the other hand, claim the rights are held by Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin, Inc., a tribal body organized in 1962. Its Articles of Incorporation provide for four categories of membership (Article X): Menominee Indian membership (\u00a7 1(a)) (all Menominee Indians appearing on the final roll of the tribe approved by the Secretary of the Interior, n. 8, supra); Associate membership of Menominee descendants (\u00a7 1(b)) (any descendants of enrolled Menominee Indians or recipients through inheritance of Menominee Enterprises securities); Associate membership of persons married to enrolled Menominees (\u00a7 1(c)); and Associate membership of non-Indians (\u00a7 1(d)). In March 1968, the first category was enlarged by amendment of Art. X, \u00a7 1(a), of the Articles of Incorporation to include all descendants of enrolled Menominee Indians with at least one-quarter Menominee blood, one or both of whose parents resided on the Menominee Reservation at the time of the descendant's birth. The corporation also adopted a resolution defining those persons entitled to exercise the hunting and fishing rights, which provided:\n'All tribal members, as defined in Article X of the Articles of Incorporation, Section 1(a), and only such members, shall have the right to exercise tribal hunting and fishing rights, subject to tribal regulations;\n'PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any member who violates any tribal hunting or fishing regulation may upon finding of the Council of Chiefs be declared ineligible to exercise such rights, for such period of time as the Council of Chiefs may specify.'\nWe believe it inappropriate, however, to resolve the question of who the beneficiaries of the hunting and fishing rights may be; and we expressly reserve decision on it. Neither it nor the nature of those rights nor the extent, if any, to which Wisconsin may regulate them has been fully briefed and argued by the parties either in the Court of Claims or in this Court, and the posture of the present litigation does not require their resolution.\n\n\n11\n As originally enacted Public Law 280 exempted the Menominees from its provisions. The House Reports on Pub.L. 280 (H.R. 1063, 83d Cong., 1st Sess.) and on Pub.L. 661 (H.R. 9821, 83d Cong., 2d Sess.) indicate that the Menominees had specifically asked for exemption from the provisions of the bill that eventually became Pub.L. 280, on the ground that their tribal law and order program was functioning satisfactorily. Subsequently, the tribe reconsidered its position and sponsored H.R. 9821, amending Pub.L. 280 to extend its provisions to the Menominee Reservation. The Department of the Interior recommended favorable action on the proposed amendment, and the amendment was enacted into law on August 24, 1954 (68 Stat. 795), two months after the passage of the Menominee Termination Act. See H.R.Rep.No. 848, 83d Cong., 1st Sess., 6 (1953); H.R.Rep.No. 2322, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. (1954).\n\n\n12\n The Act creating the Wisconsin Territory (5 Stat. 10) contained an express reservation of Indian rights, though both the Enabling Act of 1846 (9 Stat. 56), and the Act admitting Wisconsin to the Union in 1848 (9 Stat. 233) were silent on the subject. It was only a few months after Wisconsin achieved statehood that the Menominees ceded all of their Wisconsin lands to the United States in anticipation of the tribe's removal to other lands west of the Mississippi. Treaty of October 18, 1848, 9 Stat. 952. But as already noted, this removal never fully succeeded, and the Menominee Reservation created by the Treaty of Wolf River was carved out of the lands the Indians had previously ceded to the United States.\nThe State argues that since it was admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the original States, its sovereignty over the lands designated in 1854 as the Menominee Reservation attached in some degree between the time the Indians ceded all of their Wisconsin lands to the United States in 1848 and the time when the United States ceded back a certain portion of those lands for the reservation in 1854. Wisconsin contends that any hunting or fishing privileges guaranteed the Menominees free from state regulation did not survive the dissolution of the reservation and the termination of the trusteeship of the United States over the Menominees. At that time, it is said, Wisconsin's long dormant power to exercise jurisdiction over those reservation lands was awakened by the termination of the reservation.\nIf any hiatus in title to the reservation lands in question occurred between 1848 and 1854, any jurisdiction that the State may have acquired over those would not have survived the Treaty of 1854. The Treaty of Wolf River was, under Article VI of the Constitution, the 'supreme law of the land,' and the exercise of rights on reservation lands guaranteed to the tribe by the Federal Government would not be subject to state regulation, at least in absence of a cession by Congress. Cf. Ward v. Race Horse, 163 U.S. 504, 514, 16 S.Ct. 1076, 1079, 41 L.Ed. 244. In this connection it should be noted that in 1853 the Wisconsin Legislature consented to the establishment of the Menominee Reservation subsequently confirmed by the 1854 Treaty (1853 Wis.Jt.Res., c. I), an action which can be fairly construed as a disclaimer of any jurisdiction the State may have possessed.\n\n\n13\n 100 Cong.Rec. 8538.\n\n\n14\n See n. 4, supra.\n\n\n15\n Compare the hearings on the Klamath Termination bill, which took place shortly before the Menominee bills were reached, in which Senator Watkins expressed the view that perhaps the Government should 'buy out' the Indians' hunting and fishing rights rather than preserve them after termination. See Joint Hearings, Subcommittees of the Committees on Interior and Insular Affairs, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., Pt. 4, on S. 2745 and H.R. 7320, pp. 254\u2014255.\n\n\n1\n The Termination Act was adopted in response to an earlier congressional resolution which stated in part:\n'(I)t is the policy of Congress, as rapidly as possible, to make the Indians within the territorial limits of the United States subject to the same laws and entitled to the same privileges and responsibilities as are applicable to other citizens of the United States * * *.' 67 Stat. B132.\n\n\n2\n I cannot attach any significant weight to an offhand remark in a speech made by one Senator after the enactment of the bill. Ante, at 413.\nIt is, of course, irrelevant that the legislative history reveals no intention by the Congress to incur a financial obligation to the Menominees. If what the Congress did took away the Menominees' property rights, then regardless of congressional intent they are entitled to compensation from the United States for the taking.\n\n\n3\n H.R. 7135 and S. 2813, 83d Cong., 2d Sess.\n\n\n4\n H.R. 2828, 83d Cong., 2d Sess.\n\n\n5\n 'I think it is clear that (the bill) does affect those treaty rights and that those treaties are abrogated. Certainly it abolishes the tribal right to exclusive hunting and fishing privileges, because automatically upon the final termination date, the Menominee Reservation so far as hunting and fishing is concerned, would become subject to the laws of Wisconsin.' Joint Hearings on S. 2813, H.R. 2828, and H.R. 7135, Subcommittees of Committees on Interior and Insular Affairs, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., Pt. 6, pp. 692, 708.\n\n\n6\n 'Indian country' is defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151 as land within Indian reservations, dependent Indian communities, and Indian allotments.\nPublic Law 280 as originally enacted in 1953, 67 Stat. 588, did not include the Menominee reservation. In 1954 the statute was amended to include that reservation. 68 Stat. 795. From that time until the reservation was terminated in 1961, Public Law 280 governed the extent to which the State could assert jurisdiction over the Menominees on their reservation.\n\n\n7\n The only real relevance of Public Law 280 lies in its demonstration that when Congress wants to except treaty rights from jurisdictional grants, it knows how to do so. Cf. Klamath Termination Act, 68 Stat. 718, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 564 et seq., enacted by the same Congress that enacted the Menominee Termination Act, which explicitly preserves fishing rights. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 564m(b).\n\n\n8\n If, as the Court seems to say, the exceptions enumerated in Public Law 280 continue in effect after termination of Indian country, it follows that Wisconsin cannot now tax, or otherwise regulate the use of, property owned by the Memominees. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1162(b); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1360(b). Cf. Snohomish County v. Seattle Disposal Co., 70 Wash.2d 668, 425 P.2d 22, holding that Public Law 280 prohibits zoning regulation of a garbage dump on reservation land leased to non-Indians. Certiorari was denied, 389 U.S. 1016, 88 S.Ct. 585, 19 L.Ed.2d 662, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, joined by MR. JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.\n\n\n","label":1}

Pp. 506\u2014511.\n452 F.2d 370, vacated and remanded.\nJames D. Robinson, Chattanooga, Tenn., for petitioner.\nBart C. Durham, III, Nashville, Tenn., for respondent.\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nIn 1962 petitioner was tried and convicted in the Chattanooga municipal court of three counts of assault and battery in violation of a city ordinance. He was fined $50 and costs on each count. He was later indicted by the grand jury of Hamilton County, Tennessee, which, out of the same circumstances giving rise to the municipal trial, charged him with three offenses of assault with intent to commit murder in violation of state law. The petitioner pleaded guilty to the state charges and received consecutive sentences of three to 10 years for two offenses and three to five years for the third offense. He is presently in the custody of the respondent warden of the Tennessee State Penitentiary.\n\n\n2\nIn 1966 the petitioner unsuccessfully sought habeas corpus relief in state courts on the ground that the second convictions for state offenses violated his federal constitutional guarantee against twice being placed in jeopardy for the same offense. In 1967 federal courts denied a similar request for habeas corpus relief. Robinson v. Henderson, 268 F.Supp. 349 (ED Tenn.1967), aff'd, 391 F.2d 933 (CA6 1968). In 1970 the petitioner renewed his claims for habeas relief, basing his arguments on this Court's intervening decisions in Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969), and Waller v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387, 90 S.Ct. 1184, 25 L.Ed.2d 435 (1970). Holding that Waller was to be accorded retrospective effect, the District Court granted the petitioner habeas corpus relief. 320 F.Supp. 894 (ED Tenn.1971). The Sixth Circuit reversed (452 F.2d 370 (1971)) and we granted certiorari to decide the retroactivity of Waller v. Florida. Robinson v. Neil, 406 U.S. 916, 92 S.Ct. 1800, 32 L.Ed.2d 115 (1972).\n\n\n3\nThe Fifth Amendment's guarantee that no person be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense was first held binding on the States in Benton v. Maryland, supra. Our subsequent decision in Waller v. Florida, supra, held that the scope of this guarantee precluded the recognition of the 'dual sovereignty' doctrine with respect to separate state and municipal prosecutions. Waller involved the theft of a mural from the City Hall of St. Petersburg, Florida. The petitioner there was first tried and convicted of violating city ordinances with respect to the destruction of city property and breach of the peace. Subsequently, he was convicted of grand larceny in violation of state law involving the same theft. The Court stated:\n\n\n4\n'the Florida courts were in error to the extent of holding      that\u2014\n\n\n5\n\"even if a person has been tried in a municipal court for the      identical offense with which he is charged in a state court, this would not be a bar to the prosecution      of such person in the proper state court.\" 397 U.S. at 395,      90 S.Ct., at 1189.\n\n\n6\nPrior to this Court's 1965 decision in Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601, there would have been less doubt concerning the retroactivity of the Waller holding. For, until that time, both the common law and our own decisions recognized a general rule of retrospective effect for the constitutional decisions of this Court, e.g., Norton v. Shelby County, 118 U.S. 425, 442, 6 S.Ct. 1121, 1125, 30 L.Ed. 178 (1886), subject to limited exceptions of a nature such as those stated in Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank, 308 U.S. 371, 60 S.Ct. 317, 84 L.Ed. 329 (1940). In Linkletter, the Court, declaring that it was charting new ground (381 U.S., at 628 and n. 13, 85 S.Ct., at 1737), held that with respect to new constitutional interpretations involving criminal rights 'the Constitution neither prohibits nor requires retrospective effect.' Id., at 629, 85 S.Ct., at 1737. Linkletter and succeeding cases established a set of factors for determining which constitutional rules were to be accorded retrospective and which prospective effect only.* The District Court and the Sixth Circuit in this case applied the factors enunciated by these cases to the Waller holding. The Sixth Circuit held, contrary to the conclusion of the District Court, that Waller is not to be applied retroactively.\n\n\n7\nWe do not believe that this case readily lends itself to the analysis established in Linkletter. Certainly, there is nothing in Linkletter or those cases following it to indicate that all rules and constitutional interpretations arising under the first eight Amendments must be subjected to the analysis there enunciated. Linkletter itself announced an exception to the general rule of retroactivity in a decision announcing that the exclusionary rule of Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), would be given prospective effect only. Linkletter, and the other cases relied upon by the Sixth Circuit, dealt with those constitutional interpretations bearing on the use of evidence or on a particular mode of trial. Those procedural rights and methods of conducting trials, however, do not encompass all of the rights found in the first eight Amendments. Guarantees that do not relate to these procedural rules cannot, for retroactivity purposes, be lumped conveniently together in terms of analysis. For the purpose and effect of the various constitutional guarantees vary sufficiently among themselves so as to affect the necessity for prospective rather than retrospective application.\n\n\n8\nLinkletter indicated, for instance, that only those procedural rules affecting 'the very integrity of the factfinding process' would be given retrospective effect. 381 U.S., at 639, 85 S.Ct., at 1743. In terms of some nonprocedural guarantees, this test is simply not appropriate. In Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972), for example, this Court held that in the situation there presented imposition of the death penalty was not constitutionally permissible. Yet, while this holding does not affect the integrity of the factfinding process, we have not hesitated to apply it retrospectively without regard to whether the rule meets the Linkletter criteria. E.g., Walker v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 936, 92 S.Ct. 2845, 33 L.Ed.2d 753.\n\n\n9\nThe prohibition against being placed in double jeopardy is likewise not readily susceptible of analysis under the Linkletter line of cases. Although the Court has not handed down a fully reasoned opinion on the retroactivity of Benton v. Maryland, it has indicated that it is retroactive without examination of the Linkletter criteria. North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969); Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 437 n. 1, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 1191, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970). These decisions do not directly control the question of whether Waller should be given retrospective effect but they bear upon its disposition.\n\n\n10\nThe guarantee against double jeopardy is significantly different from procedural guarantees held in the Linkletter line of cases to have prospective effect only. While this guarantee, like the others, is a constitutional right of the criminal defendant, its practical result is to prevent a trial from taking place at all, rather than to prescribe procedural rules that govern the conduct of a trial. A number of the constitutional rules applied prospectively only under the Linkletter cases were found not to affect the basic fairness of the earlier trial, but to have been directed instead to collateral purposes such as the deterrence of unlawful police conduct, Mapp v. Ohio, supra. In Waller, however, the Court's ruling was squarely directed to the prevention of the second trial's taking place at all, even though it might have been conducted with a scrupulous regard for all of the constitutional procedural rights of the defendant.\n\n\n11\nWe would not suggest that the distinction that we draw is an ironclad one that will invariably result in the easy classification of cases in one category or the other. The element of reliance embodied in the Linkletter analysis will not be wholly absent in the case of constitutional decisions not related to trial procedure, as indeed this case when contrasted with Furman illustrates.\n\n\n12\nIn Furman v. Georgia, supra, our mandate was tailored so as to deny to the State only the authority to impose a punishment that we held unconstitutional, without the necessity of a redetermination of the factual question of whether the offense had in fact been committed. Thus, the prejudice to the State resulting from the necessity of an entirely new trial because of procedures newly found to be constitutionally defective, with the attendant difficulties of again assembling witnesses whose memories would of necessity be dimmer for the second trial than for the first, was not present. That which was constitutionally invalid could be isolated and excised without requiring the State to begin the entire factfinding process anew.\n\n\n13\nThe application of Waller retrospectively may, on the other hand, result in a form of prejudice to the State because, in reliance upon the 'dual sovereignty' analogy, the municipal prosecution may have occurred first and the sentence already have been served prior to the commencement of the state prosecution. If the offense involved was a serious one under state law, as it apparently was in this case, the defendant may have been unintentionally accorded a relatively painless form of immunity from the state prosecution. But the Court's opinion in Waller makes clear that the analogy between state and municipal prosecutions, and federal and state prosecutions permitted in Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121, 79 S.Ct. 676, 3 L.Ed.2d 684 (1959), had never been sanctioned by this Court and was not analytically sound. Since the issue did not assume federal constitutional proportions until after Benton v. Maryland held the Double Jeopardy Clause applicable to the States, this Court had not earlier had occasion to squarely pass on the issue. But its decision in Waller cannot be said to have marked a departure from past decisions of this Court. Therefore, while Waller-type cases may involve a form of practical prejudice to the State over and above the refusal to permit the trial that the Constitution bars, the justifiability of the State's reliance on lower court decisions supporting the dual sovereignty analogy was a good deal more dubious than the justification for reliance that has been given weight in our Linkletter line of cases. We intimate no view as to what weight should be accorded to reliance by the State that was justifiable under the Linkletter test in determining retroactivity of a nonprocedural constitutional decision such as Waller.\n\n\n14\nWe hold, therefore, that our decision in Waller v. Florida, is to be accorded full retroactive effect. We refrain from an outright reversal of the judgment below, however, because statements of counsel at oral argument raised the issue of whether the state and municipal prosecutions were actually for the same offense. We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case so that respondent may have an opportunity to present this issue there or in the District Court.\n\n\n15\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n16\nJudgment of the Court of Appeals vacated and case remanded.\n\n\n17\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MARSHALL concur.\n\n\n18\nAlthough I otherwise join the opinion of the Court, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals outright. I adhere to my view that, regardless of the similarity of the offenses, the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which is applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969), requires the prosecution, except in most limited circumstances not present here, 'to join at one trial all the charges against a defendant that grow out of a single criminal act, occurrence, episode, or transaction.' Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 453\u2014454, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 1199, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring); see Grubb v. Oklahoma, 409 U.S. 1017, 93 S.Ct. 450, 34 L.Ed.2d 309 (1972) (Brennan, J., dissenting); Miller v. Oregon, 405 U.S. 1047, 92 S.Ct. 1321, 31 L.Ed.2d 590 (1972) (Brennan, J., dissenting); Harris v. Washington, 404 U.S. 55, 57, 92 S.Ct. 183, 184, 30 L.Ed.2d 212 (1971) (separate statement of Douglas, Brennan, and Marshall, JJ.). Under this 'same transaction' test, all charges against petitioner should have been brought in a single prosecution.\n\n\n\n*\n See Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969), which carefully examined all of the cases decided since Linkletter and more fully enunciated the guiding criteria of those cases.\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"363 U.S. 405\n80 S.Ct. 1139\n4 L.Ed.2d 1299\nDiamond KIMM, Petitioner,v.George K. ROSENBERG, District Director, Immigration  and Naturalization Service.\nNo. 139.\nArgued May 16 and 17, 1960.\nDecided June 13, 1960.\n\nMr. Joseph Forer, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nMr. John F. Davis, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner applied for suspension of an order directing his deportation to Korea or permitting his voluntary departure. He does not question the validity of the deportation order, but contends that he is within the eligible statutory class whose deportation may be suspended at the discretion of the Attorney General. \u00a7 19(c) of the Immigration Act of 1917, as amended. Relief on this score was denied on the basis that the Attorney General has no power to exercise his discretion in that regard since petitioner failed to prove his eligibility under that section and the Internal Security Act of 1950.\n\n\n2\nBefore the hearing officer, petitioner was asked if he was a member of the Communist Party. He refused to answer, claiming the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The officer refused the suspension on the grounds that petitioner had failed to prove that he was a person of good moral character and that he had not met the statutory requirement of showing that he was not a member of or affiliated with the Communist Party. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed on the latter ground, as did the Court of Appeals. Kimm v. Hoy, 263 F.2d 773.\n\n\n3\nPetitioner contends that he presented 'clear affirmative evidence' as to eligibility which stands uncontradicted and that the burden was on the Government to show his affiliations, if any, with the Party. He contends that the disqualifying factor of Communist Party membership is an exception to \u00a7 19(c) which the Government must prove. We think not. Rather than a proviso, it is an absolute disqualification, since that class of aliens is carved out of the section at its very beginning by the words 'other than one to whom subsection (d) of this section is applicable.1 Subsection (d)2 referred to aliens deportable under the Act of October 16, 1918. Section 22 of the Internal Security Act of 1950 amended the 1918 Act to include Communists,3 and thus terminated the discretionary authority under \u00a7 19(c) as to any alien who was deportable because of membership in the Communist Party. Petitioner offered no evidence on this point, although the regulations place on him the burden of proof as to 'the statutory requirements precedent to the exercise of discretionary relief.' 8 CFR, 1949 ed., \u00a7 151.3(e), as amended, 15 Fed.Reg. 7638. This regulation is completely consistent with \u00a7 19(c). The language of that section, in contrast with the statutory provisions governing deportation, imposes the general burden of proof upon the applicant.\n\n\n4\nIt follows that an applicant for suspension, 'a matter of discretion and of administrative grace,' U.S. ex rel. Hintopoulos v. Shaughnessy, 1957, 353 U.S. 72, 77, 77 S.Ct. 618, 621, 1 L.Ed.2d 652, must, upon the request of the Attorney General, supply such information that is within his knowledge and has a direct bearing on his eligibility under the statute. The Attorney General may, of course, exercise his authority of grace through duly delegated agents. Jay v. Boyd, 1956, 351 U.S. 345, 76 S.Ct. 919, 100 L.Ed. 1242. Perhaps the petitioner was justified in his personal refusal to answer\u2014a question we do not pass upon\u2014but this did not relieve him under the statute of the burden of establishing the authority of the Attorney General to exercise his discretion in the first place.\n\n\n5\nAffirmed.\n\n\n6\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice BLACK concur, dissenting.\n\n\n7\nIt has become much the fashion to impute wrongdoing to or do impose punishment on a person for invoking his constitutional rights.1 Lloyd Barenblatt has served a jail sentence for invoking his First Amendment rights. See Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U.S. 109, 79 S.Ct. 1081, 3 L.Ed.2d 1115. As this is written, Dr. Willard Uphaus, as a consequence of our decision in Uphaus v. Wyman, 360 U.S. 72, 79 S.Ct. 1040, 3 L.Ed.2d 1090, is in jail in New Hampshire for invoking rights guaranteed to him by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. So is the mathematician, Horace Chandler Davis, who invoked the First Amendment against the House Un-American Activities Committee. Davis v. United States, 6 Cir., 269 F.2d 357. Today we allow invocation of the Fifth Amendment to serve, in effect though not in terms, as proof that an alien lacks the 'good moral character' which he must have under \u00a7 19(c) of the Immigration Act in order to become eligible for the dispensing powers entrusted to the Attorney General.\n\n\n8\nThe import of what we do is underlined by the fact that there is not a shred of evidence of bad character in the record against this alien. The alien has fully satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 19(c) as shown by the record. He entered as a student in 1928 and pursued his studies until 1938. He planned to return to Korea but the outbreak of hostilities between China and Japan in 1937 changed his mind. Since 1938 he has been continuously employed in gainful occupations. That is the sole basis of his deportability.2 The record shows no criminal convictions, nothing that could bring stigma to the man. His employment since 1938 has been as manager of a produce company, as chemist, as foundry worker, and as a member of O.S.S. during the latter part of World War II. He also was self-employed in the printing business, publishing a paper 'Korean Independence.' No one came forward to testify that he was a Communist. There is not a word of evidence that he had been a member of the Communist Party at any time. The only thing that stands in his way of being eligible for suspension of deportation by the Attorney General is his invocation of the Fifth Amendment.\n\n\n9\nThe statute says nothing about the need of an alien to prove he never was a Communist. If the question of Communist Party membership had never been asked and petitioner had never invoked the Fifth Amendment, can it be that he would still be ineligible for suspension? It is for me unthinkable. Presumption of innocence is too deeply ingrained in our system for me to believe that an alien would have the burden of establishing a negative. What the case comes down to is simply this: invocation of the Fifth Amendment creates suspicions and doubts that cloud the alien's claim of good moral character.\n\n\n10\nImputation of guilt for invoking the protection of the Fifth Amendment carries us back some centuries to the hated oath ex officio used both by the Star Chamber and the High Commission. Refusal to answer was contempt.3 Thus was started in the English-speaking world the great rebellion against oaths that either violated the conscience of the witness or were used to obtain evidence against him. See Ullmann v. United States, 350 U.S. 422, 445\u2014449, 76 S.Ct. 497, 510\u2014512, 100 L.Ed. 511 (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n11\nI had assumed that invocation of the privilege is a neutral act, as consistent with innocence as with guilt. We pointed out in Slochower v. Board of Education, 350 U.S. 551, 557\u2014558, 76 S.Ct. 637, 641, 100 L.Ed. 692: 'The privilege serves to protect the innocent who otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.' We re-emphasized that view in Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 391, 421, 77 S.Ct. 963, 982, 1 L.Ed.2d 931: 'Recent re-examination of the history and meaning of the Fifth Amendment has emphasized anew that one of the basic functions of the privilege is to protect innocent men.'\n\n\n12\nWe went further in Konigsberg v. State Bar, 353 U.S. 252, 267, 77 S.Ct. 722, 730, 1 L.Ed.2d 810, and in Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U.S. 232, 246, 77 S.Ct. 752, 760, 1 L.Ed.2d 796, and held that even past membership in the Communist Party was not by itself evidence that the person was of bad moral character.\n\n\n13\nWe therefore today make a marked departure from precedent when we attach a penalty for reliance on the Fifth Amendment. The Court in terms does not, and cannot, rest its decision on the ground that by invoking the Fifth Amendment the petitioner gave evidence of bad moral character. Yet the effect of its decision is precisely the same. In so holding we disregard history and, in the manner of the despised oath ex officio, attribute wrongdoing to the refusal to answer. It seems to me indefensible for courts which act under the Constitution to draw an inference of bad moral character from the invocation of a privilege which was deemed so important to this free society that it was embedded in the Bill of Rights.\n\n\n14\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS join, dissenting.\n\n\n15\nSuspension of deportation may be 'a matter of discretion and of administrative grace,' United States ex rel. Hintopoulos v. Shaughnessy, 353 U.S. 72, 77, 77 S.Ct. 618, 621, but eligibility for suspension, for the exercise of that discretion, is very much a matter of law. McGrath v. Kristensen, 340 U.S. 162, 169, 71 S.Ct. 224, 229, 95 L.Ed. 173. The decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals was that petitioner was not, under the governing statute, eligible for suspension; and on that basis its order must stand or fall in court. Securities & Exchange Comm. v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87, 63 S.Ct. 454, 459, 87 L.Ed. 626.\n\n\n16\nThe only basis of the Appeals Board's determination of ineligibility that the Government seriously defends here is the Board's finding that the petitioner had not shown he was not deportable under \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Act of October 16, 1918, 40 Stat. 1012, as amended by \u00a7 22 of the Internal Security Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 1006, 1008. Those provisions retroactively made deportable an alien who had been a Communist Party member at any time since his entry into the United States; and \u00a7 19 of the 1917 Immigration Act, 39 Stat. 889, as later amended,1 under which petitioner's eligibility for suspension was determined, made those aliens who were deportable on that basis ineligible for suspension of deportation.\n\n\n17\nIt has not been, and scarcely could be, controverted that the Government must in general bear the burden of demonstrating, in administrative proceedings, the deportability of an alien; whatever the exceptions to this rule may be,2 it was established by the time relevant here that where post-entry misconduct is charged as the basis for deportability, the burden is the Government's. Hughes v. Tropello, 3 Cir., 296 F. 306, 309; Werrmann v. Perkins, 7 Cir., 79 F.2d 467, 469. Here the Government never bore any burden of showing that petitioner was deportable as having been, since his entry, a Communist. The determination of his deportability was made on entirely different grounds; that (as was conceded) he had failed to maintain the student status on the basis of which he had been admitted to the United States. At the hearing on suspension of deportation the Government introduced literally no evidence even remotely suggesting that petitioner had ever been a Communist; and much evidence as to petitioner's good character was introduced. But, apparently at random, and out of the blue, petitioner was asked about membership in the Communist Party; and he declined to answer, citing his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. On this basis the administrative officials found that he was ineligible for suspension of deportation.\n\n\n18\nIf the basis on which it was sought to deport petitioner in the first place was that he was deportable as a Communist or ex-Communist under \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the 1918 Act, as amended, it could hardly be contended that this would be evidence, let alone sufficient evidence, that he was or had been a Communist, on which to base a finding of deportability. Cf. Slochower v. Board of Higher Education, 350 U.S. 551, 76 S.Ct. 637. The provision in \u00a7 19 of the 1917 Immigration Act, as amended, which is relied on, disqualifies from suspension an alien who is 'deportable' under the other Act; and one would think the burden of proof of deportability in both circumstances should be the same. The most obvious case, of course, for the application of \u00a7 19's disqualification from suspension is the one in which the Government, in the deportation proceedings, has already borne the burden of proving the alien deportable under the amended 1918 Act. It is an anomaly that the burden of proof shifts, there cases to be a requirement of evidence of deportability as a Communist or ex-Communist, and the alien must prove a negative in order to qualify for suspension, when the Government has chosen to base deportation on some other ground. In support of this the Court cites only a regulation which stated in general terms that it was up to the alien to show his eligibility for suspension. 8 CFR, 1949 ed., \u00a7 151.3(e), as added, 15 Fed.Reg. 7638.\n\n\n19\nI would think it perfectly plain that such a regulation, as applied in this case, would be contrary to the statutory scheme, properly and responsibly construed.3 In the first place, as I have noted, it turns around the ordinary rules as to the burden of proof as to which party shall show 'deportability.' It requires the alien to prove a negative\u2014that he never was a Communist since he entered the country\u2014when no one has said or intimated that he was. Such proof would necessarily lead to petitioner's bearing the laboring oar in showing that all his political or economic expressions in this country were independent of any covert connection with the Communist Party. The effect of imposing such a burden of exculpation on the exercise, for example, of non-Communist political action on behalf of causes which Communists might also happen to favor is obvious. In fact, on this very basis, we not so long ago struck down a state statute which placed on an individual desiring a tax exemption the burden of proof to show that his political activities were not of a proscribed nature\u2014of a nature, moreover, which we assumed the State had the power directly to proscribe. Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 520, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 1338, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460. We have this Term reaffirmed the central principle of that case, its inhibition on procedural devices which, though designed to reach legitimate ends, impose burdens on the exercise of the freedom of speech, in a subsequent decision, by striking down another state enactment. Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, 80 S.Ct. 215, 4 L.Ed.2d 205. On such a basis we declared the enactments of sovereign States unconstitutional; I think we should hardly be less willing to apply the same doctrine to set aside, as not statutorily warranted, a federal administrative regulation which anomalously truns about the ordinary state of the burden of proof as to 'deportability,' and in fact so far dispenses with the ordinary requirement of evidence of 'deportability' that the alien must shoulder the burden of negating it even where the Government has introduced no evidence at all on the issue.\n\n\n20\nWe are, apart from construction of the Constitution, responsible for the proper construction of Acts of Congress, and for determining the validity of challenged administrative regulations and procedures under them. Here we are called upon only to put a rational construction upon a federal statute and the allocation of the burden of proof under it, that will promote the statute's internal consistency and minimize its frictions with the First Amendment. One of the relevant enactments, \u00a7 22 of the 1950 Internal Security Act, is a harsh one whose constitutionality was upheld here only on historical grounds. See Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 530\u2014532, 74 S.Ct. 737, 742\u2014743, 98 L.Ed. 911. By subscribing to the anomalous allocation of the burden of proof here, we increase the statute's harshness, promote the procedural restriction on the freedom of speech which we condemned in Speiser and Smith, and in practical effect, because of the allocation, let this petitioner's invocation of his constitutional privilege be equated with a demonstration of his deportability as to the matters on which he invoked the privilege. I cannot subscribe to a construction that has this effect, and accordingly dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n Section 19(c) provided, in relevant part:\n'In the case of any alien (other than one to whom subsection (d) of this section is applicable) who is deportable under any law of the United States and who has proved good moral character for the preceding five years, the Attorney General may * * * (2) suspend deportation of such alien if he is not ineligible for naturalization * * * if he finds * * * (b) that such alien has resided continuously in the United States for seven years or more and is residing in the United States upon the effective date of this Act. * * *' 8 U.S.C.

(1946 ed.) \u00a7 204(e), now 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(F).\n\n\n3\n See Maguire, Attack of the Common Lawyers on the Oath Ex Officio As Administered in the Ecclesiatical Courts in England, Essays in History and Political Theory (1936), c. VII, p. 199, at 215, where the procedure of the High Commission is described:\n'Thus the defendant swore to answer fully and truly all questions which might be put to him before he knew the charges in detail, and in cases ex officio without knowing the accuser. Either party could produce witnesses who gave their depositions on oath, but in the most important cases ex officio mero the whole trial was based on the answers of the defendant. As in the Star Chamber the judges delivered their opinions seriatim and the decree accorded with the decision of the majority.\n'Thus the crux of the procedure was the oath ex officeo. Until the defendant had been sworn, the articles for his examination could not be produced; until he had been examined, the case could not proceed to trial. Refusal or partial answers constituted contempt, followed by imprisonmentf perjury was a cardinal sin.'\n\n\n1\n The suspension provisions, with their reference to deportability under the 1918 Act as a disqualification, were added to the old \u00a7 19 through the amendments of 1940 and 1948, 54 Stat. 672, 62 Stat. 1206.\nThe validity of the proceedings here is to be tested under the law as it stood as of the time of the administrative hearing and review in 1951 and early 1952, before the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq., 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 et seq., on June 27, 1952. See \u00a7 405(a) of the later Act, 66 Stat. 280.\n\n\n2\n Section 23 of the 1924 Immigration Act, 43 Stat. 165, placed the burden on the alien in a deportation proceeding to show that he had been lawfully admitted to the country. The current Act is to the same effect. \u00a7 291, 66 Stat. 234, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1361. The courts in the cases cited in text drew a sharp distinction between this issue and the matter of deportability owing to post-admission conduct. The failure of Congress to specify other issues on which the alien has the burden is confirmation of the correctness of these decisions. See United States ex rel. Bilokumsky v. Tod, 263 U.S. 149, 153, 44 S.Ct. 54, 55, 68 L.Ed. 221.\n\n\n3\n Section 19(c) in terms imposes a burden of proof on the alien as to his good moral character, but is silent as to the burden of proof otherwise. And it is in \u00a7 19(d) that the noneligibility of those deportable under the amended 1918 Act is provided for; and \u00a7 19(d) is inexplicit as to the burden of proof. Accordingly, no support for this application of the regulation can be found in \u00a7 19(c).\n\n\n","label":1}

DUCKWORTH, Warden.\nNo. 78-5795.\nJuly 2, 1979.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nUpon a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, the petitioner was found guilty by an Indiana jury of murder in the second degree.  The Indiana Supreme Court upon direct appeal affirmed the conviction.  Moore v. State, 260 Ind. 154, 293 N.E.2d 28 (1973).  The petitioner then sought a writ of habeas corpus in a Federal District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.  He claimed, inter alia, that he had been denied due process of law because he had been convicted upon evidence allegedly insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was sane at the time the victim was killed.*  The District Court denied the writ, and the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  581 F.2d 639 (1978).\n\n\n2\nIn holding that the District Court had been correct in rejecting the petitioner's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction, the Court of Appeals stated that such a challenge presents a federal due process issue \"only where a state court conviction is totally devoid of evidentiary support.\"  Id., at 642.  The petitioner claims that this was error, and he urges that under In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), a state prisoner is entitled to a determination whether the record evidence could support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  We agree.  Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560. Nonetheless, under the circumstances of this case we conclude that a remand for further consideration in light of Jackson v. Virginia would be inappropriate.\n\n\n3\nThe petitioner has contended that the prosecution failed to meet its burden because it relied upon lay witnesses to prove sanity without providing any expert testimony to rebut his expert opinion testimony.  But, as the Court of Appeals noted, under Indiana law sanity may be established by either expert or lay testimony.  The state appellate court, in an opinion thoroughly discussing the record evidence and the petitioner's sufficiency challenge, concluded that the lay evidence in this case could have been credited by the jury, and it held that the State's evidence was fully sufficient to support a jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the petitioner was sane at the time of the killing.\n\n\n4\nThe Court of Appeals properly deferred to the Indiana law governing proof of sanity.  Although that court applied an improper legal standard when it considered the petitioner's due process claim, it is clear from its opinion that the essence of that challenge concerned the rule of state law that permits the State to rely on lay proof of sanity.  It is likewise clear from the record that under the standard enunciated in Jackson v. Virginia, the evidence in support of this conviction was constitutionally adequate.\n\n\n5\nAccordingly, the writ of certiorari is granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n\n6\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n*\n The District Court found, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that the petitioner had failed to exhaust his available state remedies on all but his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.  The petitioner takes issue with this ruling, but we are satisfied that it was correct.\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"389 U.S. 109\n88 S.Ct. 258\n19 L.Ed.2d 319\nJames Cleveland BURGETT, Petitioner,v.STATE OF TEXAS.\nNo. 53.\nArgued Oct. 18, 1967.\nDecided Nov. 13, 1967.\n\nR. Gordon Gooch, Houston, Tex., for petitioner.\nLeon B. Douglas, Austin, Tex., for respondent.\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner was convicted of 'assault with malice aforethought with intent to murder; repetition of offense.' The jury fixed the punishment at 10 years in the Texas State Penitentiary.1 On appeal, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed petitioner's conviction.2 We granted certiorari, 386 U.S. 931, 87 S.Ct. 959, 17 L.Ed.2d 805.\n\n\n2\nPetitioner was charged in a five-count indictment. In the first count the State alleged that he had cut one Bradley with a knife and had stabbed at Bradley's throat with intent to kill. Pursuant to the Texas recidivist statutes,3 the remaining counts of the indictment consisted of allegations that petitioner had incurred four previous felony convictions: a Texas conviction for burglary, and three Tennessee convictions for forgery.  If these allegations were found to be true, petitioner would be subject to a term of life imprisonment upon conviction of the offense charged in count one.4\n\n\n3\nPetitioner's counsel filed a pretrial motion to quash the four counts of the indictment referring to the prior convictions for failure to apprise the defense of what the State would attempt to prove.5 The record is silent as to the court's action on this motion. But when the indictment was read to the jury at the beginning of the trial, before any evidence was introduced, the four counts relating to the prior convictions were included.\n\n\n4\nDuring the course of the trial, while the jury was present, the State offered into evidence a certified copy of one of the Tennessee convictions. The conviction read in part, 'Came the Assistant Attorney-General for the State and the Defendant in proper person and without Counsel.' Petitioner's counsel objected to the introduction of the record on the ground that the judgment on its face showed that petitioner was not represented by counsel in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. There was no indication in the record that counsel had been waived. The court stated that it would reserve ruling on the objection, apparently to give the State an opportunity to offer any of the other convictions into evidence. The State then offered a second version of the same Tennessee conviction which stated that petitioner had appeared 'in proper person' but did not contain the additional words 'without counsel.' This second version also stated that 'After said jury had heard the evidence, argument of counsel, and the charge of the Court, they retired to consider of their verdict.' It is not clear, however, whether 'counsel' was being used in the singular or plural, and in any event no explanation was offered for the discrepancy between the two records. Petitioner's counsel objected to this section version on the same ground. The court again reserved its ruling.\n\n\n5\nThe State then offered into evidence a certified copy of the indictment in the prior Texas case. Petitioner's counsel indicated he had no objection, and that record was received into evidence. Thereafter, testimony was offered concerning the judgment and sentence in the prior Texas case. After some testimony had been given, the jury was excused and the hearing continued out of its presence. At the conclusion of the hearing, petitioner's attorney objected that the Texas judgment was void on its face under state law. The court sustained that objection, and the record of the Texas conviction was stricken from evidence. At the same time, the court sustained petitioner's objection to the first version of the Tennessee conviction; but overruled the objection to the second version of the same conviction. The jury was then recalled and testimony was heard on the substantive offense charged. The next reference to the prior convictions was when th court instructed the jury not to consider the prior offenses6 for any purpose whatsoever in arriving at the verdict.\n\n\n6\nPetitioner's motion for a new trial was denied. In the Court of Criminal Appeals, petitioner argued, inter alia, that the court erred in permitting counts two through five of the indictment to be read to the jury at the beginning of the trial, and in failing to sustain petitioner's objection to the admission into evidence of the second version of the Tennessee conviction. The Court of Criminal Appeals held that since petitioner had not suffered the enhanced punishment provided by the recidivist statutes, and since the instruction to disregard the prior offenses had been given, no error was presented.\n\n\n7\nWe do not sit as a court of criminal appeals to review state cases. The States are free to provide such procedures as they choose, including rules of evidence, provided that none of them infringes a guarantee in the Federal Constitution. The recent right-to-counsel cases, starting with Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, are illustrative of the limitations which the Constitution places on state criminal procedures. Those limitations sometimes touch rules of evidence.\n\n\n8\nThe exclusion of coerced confessions is one example. Chambers v. State of Florida, 309 U.S. 227, 60 S.Ct. 472, 84 L.Ed. 716.\n\n\n9\nThe exclusion of evidence seized in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments is another. Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081.\n\n\n10\nStill another is illustrated by Pointer v. State of Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923. In that case we held that a transcript of a preliminary hearing had to be excluded from a state criminal trial because the defendant had no lawyer at that hearing, and did not, therefore, have the opportunity to cross-examine the principal witness against him who since that time had left the State. The exclusionary rule that we fashioned was designed to protect the privilege of confrontation guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment and made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth.\n\n\n11\nThe same result must follow here. Gideon v. Wainwright established the rule that the right to counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment was applicable to the States by virtue of the Fourteenth, making it unconstitutional to try a person for a felony in a state court unless he had a lawyer or had validly waived one. And that ruling was not limited to prospective applications. See Doughty v. Maxwell, 376 U.S. 202, 84 S.Ct. 702, 11 L.Ed.2d 650; Pickelsimer v. Wainwright, 375 U.S. 2, 84 S.Ct. 80, 11 L.Ed.2d 41. In this case the certified records of the Tennessee conviction on their face raise a presumption that petitioner was denied his right to counsel in the Tennessee proceeding, and therefore that his conviction was void. Presuming waiver of counsel from a silent record is impermissible. Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U.S. 506, 82 S.Ct. 884, 8 L.Ed.2d 70. To permit a conviction obtained in violation of Gideon v. Wainwright to be used against a person either to support guilt or enhance punishment for another offense (see Greer v. Beto, 384 U.S. 269, 86 S.Ct. 1477) is to erode the principle of that case. Worse yet, since the defect in the prior conviction was denial of the right to counsel, the accused in effect suffers anew from the deprivation of that Sixth Amendment right.\n\n\n12\nThe admission of a prior criminal conviction which is constitutionally infirm under the standards of Gideon v. Wainwright is inherently prejudicial and we are unable to say that the instructions to disregard it7 made the constitutional error 'harmless beyond a reasonable doubt' within the meaning of Chapman v. State of California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705.\n\n\n13\nOur decision last Term in Spencer v. State of Texas, 385 U.S. 554, 87 S.Ct. 648, 17 L.Ed.2d 606, is not relevant to our present problem. In Spencer the prior convictions were not presumptively void. Moreover, the contention was that the guilt phase of the trial was prejudiced by the introduction of the evidence of prior crimes. As the Court noted, '(i)n the procedures before us, * * * no specific federal right\u2014such as that dealing with confessions\u2014is involved; reliance is placed solely on a general 'fairness' approach.' Id., at 565, 87 S.Ct. at 654. In this case, however, petitioner's right to counsel, a 'specific federal right,' is being denied anew. This Court cannot permit such a result unless Gideon v. Wainwright is to suffer serious erosion.\n\n\n14\nReversed.\n\n\n15\nMr. Chief Justice WARREN, concurring.\n\n\n16\nI am in full agreement with the opinion of the Court and the reasons stated therein for reversing the conviction in this case. However, in view of the terse dissent entered by my Brother Harlan, I feel constrained to add some observations of my own.\n\n\n17\nThe dissent refers to the Court's decision in Spencer v. State of Texas, 385 U.S. 554, 87 S.Ct. 648, 17 L.Ed.2d 606, and the entire thrust of the dissent is reminiscent of that decision of last Term which placed this Court's stamp of approval on the Texas recidivist procedures from which this case evolves. The dissent reminds us that '(w)e do not sit as a court of errors and appeals in state cases.' I would not disagree with that statement is an abstract proposition. But we are not dealing with abstracts in this case. We are dealing with a very real denial of a state criminal defendant's rights as guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. We are also told by the dissent that 'this case shows no prosecutorial bad faith or intentional misconduct.' But this misses the mark. We are not limited in our review of constitutional errors in state criminal proceedings to those errors which flow from 'prosecutorial bad faith or intentional misconduct.'1 Our concern is with the effect of those errors, whether well-intentioned or not,2 on the constitutionally protected right of a criminal defendant to a fair and impartial trial.\n\n\n18\nThis case is a classic example of how a rule eroding the procedural rights of a criminal defendant on trial for his life or liberty can assume avalanche proportions, burying beneath it the integrity of the fact-finding process. In Spencer, the Court approved a procedure whereby a State, for the sole purpose of enhancing punishment, includes in the indictment allegations of prior crimes which are read to the jury and enters evidence at trial of those prior crimes, no matter how unrelated they might be to the charge on which the defendant is being tried. The rule adopted in Spencer went so far as to allow the State to enter evidence on the prior crimes even though a defendant might be willing to stipulate the earlier convictions. In this case, that harsh rule was expanded to a degree close to barbarism.\n\n\n19\nIn addition to charging the petitioner with the principal crime of 'assault with malice aforethought with intent to murder,' the indictment alleged four prior convictions, one in Texas and three in Tennessee. Despite the efforts of the petitioner's attorney to quash those portions of the indictment referring to the prior crimes, the entire indictment was read to the jury at the start of the petitioner's one-day trial. The prosecutor then proceeded to offer evidence of the prior convictions. The petitioner's attorney objected to evidence of one Tennessee conviction because a certified copy of that conviction showed that the petitioner had not been represented by counsel. The trial judge reserved his ruling on the objection. The prosecution next offered a second version of that same Tennessee conviction which omitted any reference to the absence of counsel but which did not show a waiver of counsel. The petitioner's attorney again objected and the trial judge again reserved his ruling. The prosecutor then offered into evidence a certified copy of the indictment in the prior Texas case, and it was received without objection. All this occurred in the presence of the jury. However, when the petitioner's attorney objected to evidence concerning the judgment and sentence in the prior Texas case, the jury was excused and testimony was taken out of the presence of the jury. At the close of that evidence and before the jury returned, the trial judge ruled that the prior Texas conviction was void under state law. In addition, the trial judge sustained the objection to the first version of the Tennessee conviction but overruled the objection to the second version of the same conviction.3 The jury then returned and the trial continued. The next the jury was to hear of the prior convictions was a brief instruction from the trial judge advising the jurors not to consider the prior crimes for any purpose. The jury was never told, however, that two of the prior convictions charged were void and that the prosecution had failed to offer testimony on the validity of the other prior crimes charged in the indictment.\n\n\n20\nThus, the jury went into its deliberations knowing that the petitioner had been convicted and imprisoned for four prior felonies, although not one had been proven at the trial. To expect that the jury could wipe this from its memory and decide the petitioner's guilt only on the basis of the evidence of assault is to place too much faith in a jury's ability to detach itself from reality. This is particularly true since the trial judge gave the jurors not the slightest clue as to why matters which consumed so much time at trial were suddenly being removed from their consideration.\n\n\n21\nTo suggest that such a procedure accords a man charged with a crime due process is beyond belief. This Court has reversed convictions in other cases based on unfair influences on juries which must be deemed minor when compared to the pervasive prejudice in this case. Not long ago we ruled that a defendant was denied due process when a court bailiff remarked in the presence of the jurors, 'Oh that wicked fellow, he is guilty'; and, 'If there is anything wrong (in the verdict) the Supreme Court will correct it.' Parker v. Gladden, 385 U.S. 363, 87 S.Ct. 468, 17 L.Ed.2d 420. We also reversed a murder conviction because two prosecution witnesses were deputy sheriffs who had been assigned to accompany the jury while it was sequestered. Turner v. State of Louisiana, 379 U.S. 466, 85 S.Ct. 546, 13 L.Ed.2d 424.4 If these transgressions offend constitutional standards of fairness, can it be doubted that the petitioner's trial was stripped of all vestiges of due process when the jurors were told of his prior void convictions and the error was not explained to them?\n\n\n22\nThis case is the frightful progeny of Spencer and of that decision's unjustified deviation from settled principles of fairness. Today we have placed a needed limitation on the Spencer rule, but nothing except an outright rejection would truly serve the cause of justice.\n\n\n23\nMr. Justice HARLAN, whom Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice WHITE join, dissenting.\n\n\n24\nThe record in this case shows no prosecutorial bad faith or intentional misconduct. To the extent that the prosecutor contemplated the use of prior convictions in a one-stage recidivist trial, his right to do so is of course established by Spencer v. State of Texas, 385 U.S. 554, 87 S.Ct. 648, 17 L.Ed.2d 606, decided only last Term. The fact that the prior convictions turned out to be inadmissible for other reasons involves at the most a later corrected trial error in the admission of evidence. We do not sit as a court of errors and appeals in state cases, and I would affirm the judgment of the state court.\n\n\n\n1\n The maximum penalty for a first conviction of assault with intent to murder is 25 years; the minimum penalty is two years. Tex.Pen.Code, Art. 1160 (Supp.1966).\n\n\n2\n Burgett v. State of Texas, Tex.Cr.App., 397 S.W.2d 79 (1965).\n\n\n3\n The statutes involved here are Articles 62 and 63 of the Tex.Pen.Code (1952).\nArticle 62 provides: 'It is be shown on the trial of a felony less than capital that the defendant has been before convicted of the same offense, or one of the samd nature, the punishment on such second or other subsequent conviction shall be the highest which is affixed to the commission of such offenses in ordinary cases.'\nArticle 63 provides: 'Whoever shall have been three times convicted of a felony less than capital shall on such third conviction be imprisoned for life in the penitentiary.'\n\n\n4\n Tex.Pen.Code, Art. 63 (1952).\n\n\n5\n In petitioner's amended motion for a new trial, which was denied by the court, he explained that the purpose of the pretrial motion was 'so that defendant could establish their (the previous convictions alleged for enhancement) admissibility before they were read into the record in the presence of the jury; same reading into the record in the presence of the jury was prejudicial to defendant herein.'\n\n\n6\n The court apparently withdrew consideration of the prior convictions from the jury since only the record of the one prior Tennessee conviction for forgery had been accepted. Thus, Article 63 could not be applied to petitioner. Further, since forgery could not be considered as an offense of the 'same nature' as assault with intent to murder, Article 62 would not be applicable. See n. 3, supra.\nThe State apparently did not attempt to introduce the records of the other two Tennessee convictions for forgery because the indictment showed that all of the convictions occurred on the same date. To invoke the provisions of Article 63, each succeeding conviction must be subsequent in time to the previous conviction both with respect to commission of the offense and to conviction. Cowan v. State, 172 Tex.Cr.R. 183, 355 S.W.2d 521 (1962).\n\n\n7\n See, e.g., Boyd v. United States, 142 U.S. 450, 12 S.Ct. 292, 35 L.Ed. 1077; United States v. Clarke, 343 F.2d 90 (C.A.3d Cir. 1965). Cf. Waldron v. Waldron, 156 U.S. 361, 383, 15 S.Ct. 383, 389, 39 L.Ed. 453; Throckmorton v. Holt, 180 U.S. 552, 21 S.Ct. 474, 45 L.Ed. 663; Lawrence v. United States, 357 F.2d 434 (C.A.10th Cir. 1966); United States v. DeDominicis, 332 F.2d 207 (C.A.2d Cir. 1964).\nWhat Mr. Justice Jackson said in Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440, 445, 453, 69 S.Ct. 716, 723, 93 L.Ed. 790 (concurring opinion), in the sensitive area of conspiracy is equally applicable in this sensitive area of repetitive crimes, 'The naive assumption that prejudicial effects can be overcome by instructions to the jury * * * all practicing lawyers know to be unmitigated fiction.'\n\n\n1\n Prosecutorial bad faith, of course, is not an irrelevant element in our review of state criminal convictions. It can often make even more intolerable errors which demand correction in this Court. See, e.g., Miller v. Pate, 386 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 785, 17 L.Ed.2d 690; Napue v. People of State of Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217; Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103, 55 S.Ct. 340, 79 L.Ed. 791.\n\n\n2\n The dissent is not alone in viewing this case solely in terms of the prosecutor's good or bad faith. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals disposed of the petitioner's objection to the use of the prior void convictions at trial with the cryptic observation that '(t)here is no showing of bad faith on the part of the state in alleging or attempting to prove the prior convictions.' Boswell tells us that Dr. Johnson once observed that 'Hell is paved with good intentions.' Boswell, Life of Samuel Johnson 257 (Great Books ed. 1952). If the good-faith view of this case should prevail, then surely this petitioner's road to prison would be paved with the same good intentions.\n\n\n3\n The record is silent concerning the second and third Tennessee convictions alleged in the indictment, and the prosecution apparently did not offer any evidence on those convictions. However, the jury had been made aware of those prior crimes when the indictment was read at the start of the trial.\n\n\n4\n I do not mean to express any disapproval of our decisions in Parker and Turner. I joined both of those opinions and I have no doubt the practices condemned in those cases were at odds with settled principles of due process of law. However, it follows a fortiori from those decisions that we are presented in this case with a violation of due process.\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"372 U.S. 368\n83 S.Ct. 801\n9 L.Ed.2d 821\nJames H. GRAY et al., Appellants,v.James O'Hear SANDERS.\nNo. 112.\nArgued Jan. 17, 1963.\nDecided March 18, 1963.\n\n[Syllabus from pages 368-369 intentionally omitted]\nB. D. Murphy and E. Freeman Leverett, Atlanta, Ga., for appellants.\nMorris B. Abram, Atlanta, Ga., for appellee.\nAtty. Gen., Robert F. Kennedy for the United States, as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nI.\n\n1\nThis suit was instituted by appellee, who is qualified to vote in primary and general elections in Fulton County, Georgia, to restrain appellants from using Georgia's county unit system as a basis for counting votes in a Democratic primary for the nomination of a United States Senator and statewide officers, and for declaratory relief. Appellants are the Chairman and Secretary of the Georgia State Democratic Executive Committee, and the Secretary of State of Georgia. Appellee alleges that the use of the county unit system in counting, tabulating, consolidating, and certifying votes cast in primary elections for statewide offices violates the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Seventeenth Amendment. As the constitutionality of a state statute was involved and the question was a substantial one, a three-judge court was properly convened. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281; United States v. Georgia Public Service Comm., 371 U.S. 285, 83 S.Ct. 397, 9 L.Ed.2d 317.\n\n\n2\nAppellants moved to dismiss; and they also filed an answer denying that the county unit system was unconstitutional and alleging that it was designed 'to achieve a reasonable balance as between urban and rural electoral power.'\n\n\n3\nUnder Georgia law each county is given a specified number of representatives in the lower House of the General Assembly.1 This county unit system at the time this suit was filed was employed as follows in statewide primaries:2 (1) Candidates for nominations who received the highest number of popular votes in a county were considered to have carried the county and to be entitled to two votes for each representative to which the county is entitled in the lower House of the General Assembly; (2) the majority of the county unit vote nominated a United States Senator and Governor; the plurality of the county unit vote nominated the others.\n\n\n4\nAppellee asserted that the total population of Georgia in 1960 was 3,943,116; that the population of Fulton County, where he resides, was 556,326; that the residents of Fulton County comprised 14.11% of Georgia's total population; but that, under the county unit system, the six unit votes of Fulton County constituted 1.46% of the total of 410 unit votes, or one-tenth of Fulton County's percentage of statewide population. The complaint further alleged that Echols County, the least populous county in Georgia, had a population in 1960 of 1,876, or .05% of the State's population, but the unit vote of Echols County was .48% of the total unit vote of all counties in Georgia, or 10 times Echols County's statewide percentage of population. One unit vote in Echols County represented 938 residents, whereas one unit vote in Fulton County represented 92,721 residents. Thus, one resident in Echols County had an influence in the nomination of candidates equivalent to 99 residents of Fulton County.\n\n\n5\nOn the same day as the hearing in the District Court, Georgia amended the statutes challenged in the complaint. This amendment3 modified the county unit system by allocating units to counties in accordance with a 'bracket system' instead of doubling the number of representatives of each county in the lower House of the Georgia Assembly. Counties with from 0 to 15,000 people were allotted two units; an additional one unit was allotted for the next 5,000 persons; an additional unit for the next 10,000 persons; another unit for each of the next two brackets of 15,000 persons; and, thereafter, two more units for each increase of 30,000 persons. Under the amended Act, all candidates for statewide office (not merely for Senator and Governor as under the earlier Act) are required to receive a majority of the county unit votes to be entitled to nomination in the first primary. In addition, in order to be nominated in the first primary, a candidate has to receive a majority of the popular votes unless there are only two candidates for the nomination and each receives an equal number of unit votes, in which event the candidate with the popular majority wins. If no candidate receives both a majority of the unit votes and a majority of the popular votes, a second run-off primary is required between the candidate receiving the highest number of unit votes and the candidate receiving the highest number of popular votes. In the second primary, the candidate receiving the highest number of unit votes is to prevail. But again, if there is a tie in unit votes, the candidate with the popular majority wins.\n\n\n6\nAppellee was allowed to amend his complaint so as to challenge the amended Act. The District Court held that the amended Act had some of the vices of the prior Act. It stated that under the Amended Act 'the vote of each citizen counts for less and less as the population of the county of his residence increases.' 203 F.Supp. 158, 170, n. 10. It went on to say:\n\n\n7\n'There are 97 two-unit counties, totalling 194 unit votes,      and 22 counties totalling 66 unit votes, altogether 260 unit      votes, within 14 of a majority; but no county in the above      has as much as 20,000 population. The remaining 40 counties      range in population from 20,481 to 556,326, but they control      altogether only 287 county unit votes. Combination of the      units from the counties having the smallest population gives      counties having population of one-third of the total in the      state a clear majority of county units.' Ibid.\n\n\n8\nThe District Court held that as a result of Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663, it had jurisdiction, that a justiciable case was stated, that appellee had standing, and that the Democratic primary in Georgia is 'state' action within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. It held that the county unit system as applied violates the Equal Protection Clause, and it issued an injunction,4 not against conducting any party primary election under the county unit system, but against conducting such an election under a county unit system that does not meet the requirements specified by the court.5 203 F.Supp. 158. In other words, the District Court did not proceed on the basis that in a statewide election every qualified person was entitled to one vote and that all weighted voting was outlawed. Rather it allowed a county unit system to be used in weighting the votes if the system showed no greater disparity against a county than exists against any State in the conduct of national elections.6 Thereafter the Democratic Committee voted to hold the 1962 primary election for the statewide offices mentioned on a popular vote basis. We noted probable jurisdiction. 370 U.S. 921, 82 S.Ct. 1564, 8 L.Ed.2d 502.\n\nII.\n\n9\nWe agree with the District Court that the action of this party in the conduct of its primary constitutes state action within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. Judge Sibley, writing for the court in Chapman v. King, 5 Cir., 154 F.2d 460, showed with meticulous detail the manner in which Georgia regulates the conduct of party primaries (id. pp. 463\u2014464) and he concluded:\n\n\n10\n'We think these provisions show that the State, through the      managers it requires, collaborates in the conduct of the      primary, and puts its power behind the rules of the party. It      adopts the primary as a part of the public election      machinery. The exclusions of voters made by the party by the      primary rules become exclusions enforced by the State.' Id.,      p. 464.\n\n\n11\nWe agree with that result and conclude that state regulation of this preliminary phase of the election process makes it state action. See United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 85 L.Ed 1368; Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649, 64 S.Ct. 757, 88 L.Ed. 987.\n\n\n12\nWe also agree that appellee, like any person whose right to vote is impaired (Smith v. Allwright, supra; Baker v. Carr, supra, 369 U.S. pp. 204\u2014208, 82 S.Ct. pp. 703\u2014705), has standing to sue.7\n\n\n13\nMoreover, we think the case is not moot by reason of the fact that the Democratic Committee voted to hold the 1962 primary on a popular vote basis. But for the injunction issued below, the 1962 Act remains in force; and if the complaint were dismissed it would govern future elections. In addition, the voluntary abandonment of a practice does not relieve a court of adjudicating its legality, particularly where the practice is deeply rooted and long standing. For if the case were dismissed as moot appellants would be 'free to return to * * * (their) old ways.' United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632, 73 S.Ct. 894, 897, 97 L.Ed. 1303.\n\nIII.\n\n14\nOn the merits we take a different view of the nature of the problem than did the District Court.\n\n\n15\nThis case, unlike Baker v. Carr, supra, does not involve a question of the degree to which the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment limits the authority of a State Legislature in designing the geographical districts from which representatives are chosen either for the State Legislature or for the Federal House of Representatives. Nor does it include the related problems of Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110, where 'gerrymandering' was used to exclude a minority group from participation in municipal affairs. Nor does it present the question, inherent in the bicameral form of our Federal Government, whether a State may have one house chosen without regard to population. The District Court, however, analogized Georgia's use of the county unit system in determining the results of a statewide election to phases of our federal system. It pointed out that under the electoral college,8 required by Art. II, \u00a7 1, of the Constitution and the Twelfth Amendment in the election of the President, voting strength 'is not in exact proportion to population * * *. Recognizing that the electoral college was set up as a compromise to enable the formation of the Union among the several sovereign states, it still could hardly be said that such a system used in a state among its counties, assuming rationality and absence of arbitrariness in end result, could be termed invidious.' 203 F.Supp., at 169.\n\n\n16\nAccordingly the District Court as already noted9 held that use of the county unit system in counting the votes in a statewide election was permissible 'if the disparity against any county is not in excess of the disparity that exists against any state in the most recent electoral college allocation.' 203 F.Supp., at 170. Moreover the District Court held that use of the county unit system in counting the votes in a statewide election was permissible 'if the disparity against any county is not in excess of the disparity that exists * * * under the equal proportions formula for representation of the several states in the Congress.' Ibid. The assumption implicit in these conclusions is that since equality is not inherent in the electoral college and since precise equality among blocs of votes in one State or in the several States when it comes to the election of members of the House of Representatives is never possible, precise equality is not necessary in statewide elections.\n\n\n17\nWe think the analogies to the electoral college, to districting and redistricting, and to other phases of the problems of representation in state or federal legislatures or conventions10 are inapposite. The inclusion of the electoral college in the Constitution, as the result of specific historical concerns,11 validated the collegiate principle despite its inherent numerical inequality, but implied nothing about the use of an analogous system by a State in a statewide election. No such specific accommodation of the latter was ever undertaken, and therefore no validation of its numerical inequality ensued. Nor does the question here have anything to do with the composition of the state or federal legislature. And we intimate no opinion on the constitutional phases of that problem beyond what we said in Baker v. Carr, supra. The present case is only a voting case. Cf. Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U.S. 536, 47 S.Ct. 446, 71 L.Ed. 759; Nixon v. Condon, 286 U.S. 73. 52 S.Ct. 484, 76 L.Ed. 984; Smith v. Allwright, supra. Georgia gives every qualified voter one vote in a statewide election; but in counting those votes she employs the county unit system which in end result weights the rural vote more heavily than the urban vote and weights some small rural counties heavier than other larger rural counties.\n\n\n18\nStates can within limits specify the qualifications of voters in both state and federal elections; the Constitution indeed makes voters' qualifications rest on state law even in federal elections. Art. I, \u00a7 2. As we held in Lassiter v. Northampton County Election Board, 360 U.S. 45, 79 S.Ct. 985, 3 L.Ed.2d 1072, a State may if it chooses require voters to pass literacy tests, provided of course that literacy is not used as a cloak to discriminate against one class or group. But we need not determine all the limitations that are placed on this power of a State to determine the qualifications of voters, for appellee, is a qualified voter.\n\n\n19\nThe Fifteenth Amendment prohibits a State from denying or abridging a Negro's right to vote. The Nineteenth Amendment does the same for women. If a State in a statewide election weighted the male vote more heavily than the female vote or the white vote more heavily than the Negro vote, none could successfully contend that that discrimination was allowable. See Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461, 73 S.Ct. 809, 97 L.Ed. 1152. How then can one person be given twice or 10 times the voting power of another person in a statewide election merely because he lives in a rural area or because he lives in the smallest rural county? Once the geographical unit for which a representative is to be chosen is designated, all who participate in the election are to have an equal vote\u2014whatever their race, whatever their sex, whatever their occupation, whatever their income, and wherever their home may be in that geographical unit. This is required by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The concept of 'we the people' under the Constitution visualizes no preferred class of voters but equality among those who meet the basic qualifications. The idea that every voter is equal to every other voter in his State, when he casts his ballot in favor of one of several competing candidates, underlies many of our decisions.\n\n\n20\nThe Court has consistently recognized that all qualified voters have a constitutionally protected right 'to cast their ballots and have them counted at Congressional elections.' United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 315, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 1037, 85 L.Ed. 1368; see Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651, 4 S.Ct. 152, 28 L.Ed. 274; Wiley v. Sinkler, 179 U.S. 58, 21 S.Ct. 17, 45 L.Ed. 84; Swafford v. Templeton, 185 U.S. 487, 22 S.Ct. 783, 46 L.Ed. 1005. Every voter's vote is entitled to be counted once. It must be correctly counted and reported. As stated in United States v. Mosley, 238 U.S. 383, 386, 35 S.Ct. 904, 905, 59 L.Ed. 1355, 'the right to have one's vote counted' has the same dignity as 'the right to put a ballot in a box.' It can be protected from the diluting effect of illegal ballots. Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 25 L.Ed. 717; United States v. Saylor, 322 U.S. 385, 64 S.Ct. 1101, 88 L.Ed. 1341. And these rights must be recognized in any preliminary election that in fact determines the true weight a vote will have. See United States v. Classic, supra; Smith v. Allwright, supra. The concept of political equality in the voting booth contained in the Fifteenth Amendment extends to all phases of state elections, see Terry v. Adams, supra; and, as previously noted, there is no indication in the Constitution that homesite or occupation affords a permissible basis for distinguishing between qualified voters within the State.\n\n\n21\nThe only weighting of votes sanctioned by the Constitution concerns matters of representation, such as the allocation of Senators irrespective of population and the use of the electoral college in the choice of a President. Yet when Senators are chosen, the Seventeenth Amendment states the choice must be made 'by the people.' Minors, felons, and other classes may be excluded. See Lassiter v. Northampton County Election Board, supra, 360 U.S. p. 51, 79 S.Ct. p. 990. But once the class of voters is chosen and their qualifications specified, we see no constitutional way by which equality of voting power may be evaded. As we stated in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, supra, 364 U.S. p. 347, 81 S.Ct. p. 130:\n\n\n22\n'When a State exercises power wholly within the domain of      state interest, it is insulated from federal judicial review.      But such insulation is not carried over when state power is      used as an instrument for circumventing a federally protected      right.'\n\n\n23\nThe conception of political equality from the Declaration of Independence, to Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, to the Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and Nineteenth Amendments can mean only one thing\u2014one person, one vote.\n\n\n24\nWhile we agree with the District Court on most phases of the case and think it was right in enjoining the use of the county unit system12 in tabulating the votes, we vacate its judgment and remand the case so that a decree in conformity with our opinion may be entered.\n\n\n25\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n26\nJudgment vacated and case remanded.\n\n\n27\nMr. Justice STEWART, whom Mr. Justice CLARK joins, concurring.\n\n\n28\nIn joining the opinion and judgment of the Court, I emphasize what\u2014but for my Brother HARLAN'S dissent\u2014I should have thought would be apparent to all who read the Court's opinion. This case does not involve the validity of a State's apportionment of geographic constituencies from which representatives to the State's legislative assembly are chosen, nor any of the problems under the Equal Protection Clause which such litigation would present. We do not deal here with 'the basic ground rules implementing Baker v. Carr.' This case, on the contrary, involves statewide elections of a United States Senator and of state executive and judicial officers responsible to a statewide constituency. Within a given constituency, there can be room for but a single constitutional rule\u2014one voter, one vote. United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 85 L.Ed. 1368.\n\n\n29\nMr. Justice HARLAN, dissenting.\n\n\n30\nWhen Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663, was argued at the last Term we were assured that if this Court would only remove the roadblocks of Colegrove v. Green, 328 U.S. 549, 66 S.Ct. 1198, 90 L.Ed. 1432, and its predecessors to judicial review in 'electoral' cases, this Court in all likelihood would never have to get deeper into such matters. State legislatures, it was predicted, would be prodded into taking satisfactory action by the mere prospect of legal proceedings.\n\n\n31\nThese predictions have not proved true. As of November 1, 1962, the apportionment of seats in at least 30 state legislatures had been challenged in state and federal courts,1 and, besides this one, 10 electoral cases of one kind or another are already on this Court's docket.2 The present case is the first of these to reach plenary consideration.\n\n\n32\nPreliminarily, it is symptomatic of the swift pace of current constitutional adjudication that the majority opinion should have failed to mention any of the four occasions on which Georgia's County Unit System has previously been unsuccessfully challenged in this Court. Cook v. Fortson, decided with Turman v. Duckworth, 329 U.S. 675, 67 S.Ct. 21, 91 L.Ed. 596 (1946); South v. Peters, 339 U.S. 276, 70 S.Ct. 641, 94 L.Ed. 834 (1950); Cox v. Peters, 342 U.S. 936, 72 S.Ct. 559, 96 L.Ed. 697 (1952); and Hartsfield v. Sloan, 357 U.S. 916, 78 S.Ct. 1363, 2 L.Ed.2d 1363 (1958).\n\n\n33\nIt is true that none of these cases reached the stage of full plenary consideration but, in light of the judicial history recounted by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in his dissenting opinion in Baker v. Carr, supra, 82 S.Ct. at 266, 278, 82 S.Ct. at 737, 743 et seq., only the guileless could fail to recognize that the prevailing view then was that the validity of this County Unit System was not open to serious constitutional doubt.3 This estimate of the earlier situation is highlighted by the dissenting opinion of Justices BLACK and DOUGLAS in South v. Peters, supra, 339 U.S. at 277, 70 S.Ct. at 642, in which they unsuccessfully espoused the very views which now become the law. Presumably my two Brothers also reflected these same views in noting their dissents in the Cox and Hartsfield cases. See also Cook v. Fortson, etc., supra, in which Mr. Justice BLACK also noted his dissent.\n\n\n34\nBut even if the Court's present silence about these cases can be deemed justified on the premise that their summary disposition can be satisfactorily accounted for on grounds not involving the merits, I consider today's decision not supportable.\n\n\n35\nIn the context of a nominating primary respecting candidates for statewide office, the Court construes the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as requiring that each person's vote be given equal weight. The majority says: 'The conception of political equality from the Declaration of Independence, to Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, to the Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and Nineteenth Amendments can mean only one thing\u2014one person, one vote.' Ante, p. 381. The Court then strikes down Georgia's County Unit System as such, a holding which the District Court declined to make. 203 F.Supp., at 170.\n\n\n36\nThe Court's holding surely flies in the face of history. For, as impressively shown by the opinion of Frankfurter, J., in Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S., at 301\u2014324, 82 S.Ct., at 755\u2014767, 'one person, one vote' has never been the universally accepted political philosophy in England, the American Colonies, or in the United States. The significance of this historical fact seems indeed to be recognized by the Court, for it implies that its newfound formula might not obtain in a case involving the apportionment of seats in the 'State Legislature or for the Federal House of Representatives.' Ante, p. 376.\n\n\n37\nBut, independently of other reasons that will be discussed in a moment, any such distinction finds persuasive refutation in the Federal Electoral College whereby the President of the United States is chosen on principles wholly opposed to those now held constitutionally required in the electoral process for statewide office. One need not close his eyes to the circumstance that the Electoral College was born in compromise, nor take sides in the various attempts that have been made to change the system,4 in order to agree with the court below that it 'could hardly be said that such a system used in a state among its counties, assuming rationality and absence of arbitrariness in end result, could be termed invidious.' 203 F.Supp., at 169.\n\n\n38\nIndeed this Court itself some 15 years ago rejected, in a comparable situation, the notion of political equality now pronounced. In MacDougall v. Green, 335 U.S. 281, 69 S.Ct. 1, challenge was made to an Illinois law requiring that nominating petitions of a new political party be signed by at least 25,000 voters, including a minimum of 200 voters from each of at least 50 of the 102 counties in the State. The claim was that the '200 requirement' made it possible for 'the voters of the less populous counties * * * to block the nomination of candidates whose support is confined to geographically limited areas.' Id., at 283, 69 S.Ct. at 2. In disallowing this claim, the Court said (id., at 283 284, 69 S.Ct. at 2):\n\n\n39\n'To assume that political power is a function exclusively of      numbers is to disregard the practicalities of government.      Thus, the Constitution protects the interests of the smaller      against the greater by giving in the Senate entirely unequal      representation to populations. It would be strange indeed,      and doctrinaire, for this Court, applying such broad      constitutional concepts as due process and equal protection      of the laws, to deny a State the power to assure a proper      diffusion of political initiative as between its thinly      populated counties and those having concentrated masses, in      view of the fact that the latter have practical opportunities      for exerting their political weight at the polls not      available to the former. The Constitution\u2014a practical      instrument of government\u2014makes no such demands on the      States.'\n\n\n40\nCertainly no support for this equal protection doctrine can be drawn from the Fifteenth, Seventeenth, or Nineteenth Amendment. The Fifteenth Amendment simply assures that the right to vote shall not be impaired 'on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.' The Seventeenth Amendment provides that Senators shall be 'elected by the people,' with no indication that all people must be accorded a vote of equal weight. The Nineteenth Amendment merely gives the vote to women. And it is hard to take seriously the argument that 'dilution' of a vote in consequence of a legislatively sanctioned electoral system can, without more, be analogized to an impairment of the political franchise by ballot box stuffing or other criminal activity, e.g., United States v. Mosley, 238 U.S. 383, 35 S.Ct. 904, 59 L.Ed. 1355; United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 85 L.Ed. 1368; United States v. Saylor, 322 U.S. 385, 64 S.Ct. 1101, 88 L.Ed. 1341, or to the disenfranchisement of qualified voters on purely racial grounds, Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110.\n\n\n41\nA violation of the Equal Protection Clause thus cannot be found in the mere circumstance that the Georgia County Unit System results in disproportionate vote weighting. It 'is important for this court to avoid extracting from the very general language of the 14th Amendment a system of delusive exactness * * *.' Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Barber Asphalt Co., 197 U.S. 430, 434, 25 S.Ct. 466, 467, 49 L.Ed. 819 (Holmes, J.). What then remains of the equal protection claim in this case?\n\n\n42\nAt the core of Georgia's diffusion of voting strength which favors the small as against the large counties is the urban-rural problem, so familiar in the American political scene. In my dissent in Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S., at 336, 82 S.Ct., at 774, I expressed the view that a State might rationally conclude that its general welfare was best served by apportioning more seats in the legislature to agricultural communities than to urban centers, lest the legitimate interests of the former be submerged in the stronger electoral voice of the latter. In my opinion, recognition of the same factor cannot be deemed irrational in the present situation even though all of the considerations supporting its use in a legislative apportionment case are not present here.\n\n\n43\nGiven the undeniably powerful influence of a state governor on law and policy making,5 I do not see how it can be deemed irrational for a State to conclude that a candidate for such office should not be one whose choice lies with the numerically superior electoral strength of urban voters. By like token, I cannot consider it irrational for Georgia to apply its County Unit System to the selection of candidates for other statewide offices6 in order to assure against a predominantly 'city point of view' in the administration of the State's affairs.\n\n\n44\nOn the existing record, this leaves the question of 'irrationality' in this case to be judged on the basis of pure arithmetic. The Court by its 'one person, one vote' theory in effect avoids facing up to that problem, but the District Court did face it, holding that the disparities in voting strength between the largest county (Fulton) and the four smallest counties (Webster, Glascock, Quitman, and Echols), running respectively 8 to 1, 10 to 1, 11 to 1, and 14 to 1 in favor of the latter,7 were invidiously discriminatory. But it did not tell us why. I do not understand how, on the basis of these mere numbers, unilluminated as they are by any of the complex and subtle political factors involved, a court of law can say, except by judicial fiat, that these disparities are in themselves constitutionally invidious.\n\n\n45\nThe disproportions in the Georgia County Unit System are indeed not greatly out of line with those existing under the Electoral College count for the Presidency. The disparity in population per Electoral College vote between New York (the largest State in the 1960 census) and Alaska (the smallest) was about 5 to 1.8 There are only 15 Georgia counties, out of a total of 159, which have a greater disparity per unit vote, and of these 15 counties 4 have disparity of less than 6 to 1. It is thus apparent that a slight modification of the Georgia plan could bring it within the tolerance permitted in the federal scheme.\n\n\n46\nIt was of course imponderables like these that lay at the root of the Court's steadfast pre-Baker v. Carr refusal 'to enter (the) political thicket.' Colegrove v. Green, supra, 328 U.S. at 556, 66 S.Ct. at 1201. Having turned its back on this wise chapter in its history, the Court, in my view, can no longer escape the necessity of coming to grips with the thorny problems it so studiously strove to avoid in Baker v. Carr (see concurring opinion of STEWART, J., 369 U.S., at 265, 82 S.Ct., at 736, and dissenting opinion of HARLAN, J., id., at 339, 82 S.Ct. at 775) and in two subsequent cases, Scholle v. Hare, 369 U.S. 429, 430, 82 S.Ct. 910, 8 L.Ed.2d 1 (concurring opinion of CLARK, J., and STEWART, J.), 430\u2014435, 82 S.Ct. 910\u2014913 (dissenting opinion of HARLAN, J.); W.M.C.A., Inc., v. Simon, 370 U.S. 190, 191\u2014194, 82 S.Ct. 1234, 1235\u20141236, 8 L.Ed.2d 430 (dissenting opinion of HARLAN, J.). To regard this case as being outside the general stream of electoral cases because only two other States, Maryland and Mississippi, have county unit systems, is to hide one's head in the sand.\n\n\n47\nWhat then should be the test of 'rationality' in this judicially unfamiliar field? My Brother CLARK has perhaps given us a clue in the legislative inactivity\u2014absence of any other remedy crazy quilt approach contained in his concurring opinion in Baker v. Carr, supra, at 369 U.S. 253-262, 82 S.Ct. 729\u2014734. But I think a formulation of the basic ground rules in this untrod area of judicial competence should await a fully developed record. This case is here at an interlocutory stage. The temporary injunction before us issued upon a record consisting only of the pleading, answers to interrogatories, affidavits, statistical material, and what the lower court described as a 'liberal use of our right to take judicial notice of matters of common knowledge and public concern.' 203 F.Supp., at 160, n. 1. No full-dress exploration of any of the many intricate questions involved in establishing criteria for judging 'rationality' took place, the opinion and decree below issued the day following the hearing, and the District Court observed that, while its standards of equal protection (which this Court now puts aside) 'may appear doctrinaire to some extent,' it was constrained to act as it did because of the then (but no longer existing)9 urgency of the situation. 203 F.Supp., at 170.\n\n\n48\nSurely, if the Court's 'one person, one vote' ideology is constitutionally untenable, as I think it clearly is, the basic ground rules implementing Baker v. Carr should await the trial of this or some other case in which we have before us a fully developed record. Only then can we know what we are doing. Cf. White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 83 S.Ct. 696. A matter which so profoundly touches the barriers between federal judicial and state legislative authority demands nothing less.\n\n\n49\nI would vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand the case for trial.\n\n\n\n1\n Ga.Const.1945, Art. III, \u00a7 III, I:\n'The House of Representatives shall consist of representatives apportioned among the several counties of the State as follows: To the eight counties having the largest population, three representatives each; to the thirty counties having the next largest population, two representatives each; and to the remaining counties, one representative each.'\n\n\n2\n Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 34\u20143212, 34\u20143213 (1936).\n\n\n3\n Ga.Laws 1962, Ex.Sess., No. 1, p. 1217; Ga.Code Ann., \u00a7\u00a7 34\u20143212, 34\u20143213 (1962).\n\n\n4\n The order, dated April 28, 1962, was not restricted to the party primary of September 12, 1962; nor was the relief asked so restricted.\n\n\n5\n The District Court in its order defined the type of county unit system which violated the Equal Protection Clause as follows:\n'A county unit system for use in a party primary is invidiously discriminatory if any unit has less than its share to the nearest whole number proportionate to population, or to the whole of the vote in a recent party gubernatorial primary, or to the vote for electors of the party in the most recent presidential election; provided, no discrimination is deemed to be invidious under such system if the disparity against any county is not in excess of the disparity that exists as against any state in the most recent electoral college allocation, or under the equal proportions formula for representation of the several states in the Congress of the United States, and, provided provision is made for allocations to be adjusted to accord with changes in the basis at least once each ten years.'\n\n\n6\n See note 5, supra.\n\n\n7\n Chief Justice Holt stated over 250 years ago:\n'A right that a man has to give his vote at the election of a person to represent him in parliament, there to concur to the making of laws, which are to bind his liberty and property, is a most transcendent thing, and of an high nature * * *. (I)t is a great injury to deprive * * * (him) of it. * * *\n'* * * It would look very strange, when the commons of England are so fond of their right of sending representatives to parliament, that it should be in the power of a sheriff, or other officer, to deprive them of that right, and yet that they should have no remedy * * *. This right of voting is a right in the plaintiff by the common law, and consequently he shall maintain an action for the obstruction of it. * * *\n'But in the principal case my brother says, we cannot judge of this matter, because it is a parliamentary thing. O! by all means be very tender of that. Besides it is intricate, and there may be contrariety of opinions. * * * To allow this action will make publick officers more careful to observe the constitution of cities and boroughs, and not to be so partial as they commonly are in all elections, which is indeed a great and growing mischief, and tends to the prejudice of the peace of the nation. But they say, that this is a matter out of our jurisdiction, and we ought not to inlarge it. I agree we ought not to incroach or inlarge our jurisdiction; * * * but sure we may determine on a charter granted by the king, or on a matter of custom or prescription, when it comes before us without incroaching on the parliament. And if it be a matter within our jurisdiction, we are bound by our oaths to judge of it. This is a matter of property determinable before us. Was ever such a petition heard of in parliament, as that a man was hindered of giving his vote, and praying them to give him remedy? The parliament undoubtedly would say, take your remedy at law. It is not like the case of determining the right of election between the candidates.' Ashby v. White, 2 Ld.Raym. 938, 953, 954, 956 (1702).\n\n\n8\n The electoral college was designed by men who did not want the election of the President to be left to the people. See S. Doc. No. 97, Survey of the Electoral College in the Political System of the United States, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. 'George Washington was elected to the office of Chief Magistrate of the Nation, by 69 votes\u2014the total num-\nber cast by the electors. At that time, three States did not vote. New York had not yet passed an electoral law, and North Carolina and Rhode Island had not yet ratified the Constitution. Therefore, of an estimated population of 4,000,000 people, a President was chosen by 69 voters, who had not been selected by the people, but appointed by State legislatures, save in the instances of Maryland and Virginia.' Id., p. 4.\nHamilton expressed the philosophy behind the electoral college in The Federalist No. 68. 'This process of election affords a moral certainty, that the office of president, will seldom fall to the lot of any man, who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications. Talents for low intrigue and the little arts of popularity may alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors in a single state; but it will require other talents and a different kind of merit to establish him in the esteem and confidence of the whole union, or of so considerable a portion of it as would be necessary to make him a successful candidate for the distinguished office of president of the United States. It will not be too strong to say, that there will be a constant probability of seeing the station filled by characters preeminent for ability and virtue. And this will be thought no inconsiderable recommendation of the constitution, by those, who are able to estimate the share, which the executive in every government must necessarily have in its good or ill administration.'\nPassage of the Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and Nineteenth Amendments shows that this conception of political equality belongs to a bygone day, and should not be considered in determining what the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires in statewide elections.\n\n\n9\n See note 5, supra.\n\n\n10\n We do not reach here the questions that would be presented were the convention system used for nominating candidates in lieu of the primary system.\n\n\n11\n See note 8, supra.\n\n\n12\n The county unit system, even in its amended form (see note 3, supra) would allow the candidate winning the popular vote in the county to have the entire unit vote of that county. Hence the weighting of votes would continue, even if unit votes were allocated strictly in proportion to population. Thus if a candidate won 6,000 of 10,000 votes in a particular county, he would get the entire unit vote, the 4,000 other votes for a different candidate being worth nothing and being counted only for the purpose of being discarded.\n\n\n1\n Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, Report on Apportionment of State Legislatures, December 1962, p.

{"text":"352 U.S. 202\n77 S.Ct. 275\n1 L.Ed.2d 254\nUNITED STATES of America, Petitioner,v.Paul E. PLESHA et al.\nNo. 39.\nArgued Nov. 8, 1956.\nDecided Jan. 14, 1957.\n\nMr. Lester S. Jayson, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nMr. Lawrence A. Schei, Sacramento, Cal., for respondent.\nMr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nArticle IV of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 provided a plan under which men inducted into the armed forces would continue to receive the protection of previously purchased commercial life insurance while in the service without paying premiums.1 Insurance companies were required to keep the policies of servicemen who elected to come under the Act in effect until one year after their military service ended even though these men made no further payments. The Government assured the insurance companies that the premiums would eventually be paid by giving its promissory certificates to the companies. The respondents, Plesha, Mabbutt, and Kern, who entered the Army in 1941, had previously purchased commercial life insurance. They invoked the benefits of the Act by filing proper applications with their companies and the Veterans' Administration. They made no further payment of premiums but the policies were kept in effect by government certificates. After leaving the Army, they were notified by the Veterans' Administration that unless they paid back premiums with interest their policies would lapse. Respondents allowed the policies to lapse and the Government paid the insuring companies the back premiums after first deducting the cash surrender value of the policies. In this case, the Government contends that it has a legal right to be reimbursed for these payments.2 The District Court agreed with this contention, 123 F.Supp. 593. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding Servicemen had no statutory or contractual obligation to the Government to repay the premiums. 227 F.2d 624.3 We affirm the judgment below because the language of the 1940 Act, its legislative history and its administrative interpretation demonstrate that Congress intended that ex-soldiers would not have to reimburse the Government.\n\n\n2\n1. The Act.\u2014As the Government concedes, the 1940 Act contained no express provision which required reimbursement for premiums paid by the Government on a lapsed policy.4 But significantly it did contain specific provisions to reduce any losses the Government might incur in administering the insurance plan by giving the Government certain other rights. Under \u00a7 408 the United States had a lien upon the policy from the time it came under the protection of the Act. When a soldier died the insurance company was authorized by \u00a7 409 to deduct unpaid premiums from the proceeds payable under the policy. If after leaving the service the insured desired to maintain his policy, \u00a7 410 required him to pay the unpaid premiums to the insurance company. If he chose not to pay these premiums, \u00a7 410 further provided that the policy would lapse. And if a policy lapsed, \u00a7 411 provided that the United States should be given credit for the policy's cash surrender value as an offset against the Government's promise to pay the back premiums. There was nothing that indicated that an ex-soldier had to reimburse the Government for any balance that it paid.\n\n\n3\n2. The legislative history.\u2014The Government's claim for reimbursement is refuted by the legislative history. Article IV of the 1940 Act substantially reenacted the insurance provisions of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 19185 and had little independent legislative history. We agree with the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs that this scant history 'is of little, if any, help' in interpreting the 1940 Act.6 We must therefore examine the history of the 1918 bill.7 During the Senate Committee hearings on this bill, Senator Reed, who was the principal critic of its insurance provisions, interpreted them as permitting a soldier to let his policy lapse without any obligation to restore the premiums paid by theGovernment.8 He objected to the Government's bearing any part of the cost and even suggested that the bill should be amended to authorize the Government to deduct the premiums from the soldier's monthly pay. Professor John H. Wigmore, who as a major representing the Army had a dominant part in drafting the bill and presenting it to Congress, strongly objected to Senator Reed's suggestions. Professor Wigmore pointed out that this benefit would be in keeping with the many new benefits which were being conferred on servicemen at that critical war period. When directly asked whether a soldier could be made to pay, he called attention to the fact that the Government had a lien on the policy and could recover the cash surrender value. He admitted, however, that the cash surrender value would not in all cases pay the entire amount of back premiums but predicted that the loss to the Government would be very slight.9 The Committee accepted Professor Wigmore's position and reported the bill in the form he urged.\n\n\n4\nThe House Judiciary Committee made a comprehensive report on the 1918 bill.10 It referred to the insurance sections as providing a method for the Government to 'carry' the premiums upon servicemen's policies in private companies. The Committee recognized that carrying this insurance would cost the Government money, but expressed the hope that this burden would not be large because:\n\n\n5\n'In the first place the Government only guarantees the      payment of the premiums. If the soldier dies the insurance      company will get its premiums out of the policy and the      Government's guaranty will not be called upon. If the soldier      comes back from the war he will repay the premiums if he      continues the policy, and if he lets the policy lapse the      Government will be subrogated to his rights.'11\n\n\n6\nThus, the Committee apparently thought that the Government must look to the cash surrender value to mitigate its loss where a policy was allowed to lapse.\n\n\n7\nIn 1942, the 1940 Act was amended to require ex-servicemen to reimburse the Government for back premiums paid by it on their lapsed policies.12 The Government contends that this 1942 Amendment was to clarify and reaffirm the meaning of the 1940 Act. However it appears that the Veterans' Administration requested the 1942 Amendment to '* * * eliminate the possibility of requiring the Government to pay premiums on insurance which the insured does not intend to carry except during his period of active service. * * *'13 And during a hearing before the House Committee on Military Affairs a Veterans' Administration representative testified, '(t)he insured is liable for all of the premiums of the $5,000 policy, the Government acting really as a guarantor. However, if there is a default (by the ex-serviceman), there would not be any liability for the whole amount, in excess of the cash (surrender) value under present construction of existing law.'14 If the legislative history of the 1942 Act indicates anything, it is that Congress thought that it was changing the law by changing the language of the Act.15\n\n\n8\n3. The administrative interpretation.\u2014The administration of the 1918 and 1940 Acts does not support the Government's claim for reimbursement. The Government relies on the fact that a few soldiers who invoked the protection of the 1918 Act and allowed their policies to lapse were later required to reimburse it. However these collections were so sporadic and so insignificant that instead of supporting the Government's position they contradict it.16 Under the 1940 Act, \u00a7 401(2) required the Veterans' Administration to issue notices explaining the Act. None of the notices promulgated prior to 1943 suggested any duty on the part of servicemen to reimburse the Government.17 But public statements of Veterans' Administration officials gave the Act a squarely contrary construction.18\n\n\n9\nSection 401(1) required soldiers seeking the benefit of the 1940 Act to file applications on forms prepared in accordance with the regulations of the Veterans' Administration. The respondents here filed such an application which included within its terms the following agreement:\n\n\n10\n'In consideration hereof, I hereby consent and agree that the      United States shall be protected in the amount of any      premiums and interest guaranteed on the above numbered policy      in the event of its maturity as a claim, or out of the cash      surrender value of the policy, at the expiration of the      period of protection under the Act.'\n\n\n11\nThis contract, prepared by the Veterans' Administration, contained no suggestion to soldiers that they would be expected to reimburse the Government for its payment of premiums if they permitted their policies to lapse. Had the Veterans' Administration construed the Act as imposing such a liability on soldiers, we think it would have mentioned the obligation in the contract that it asked them to sign.\n\n\n12\nCongress passed the 1918 and 1940 Acts at a time when men were being called from civilian life into the Army in the face of impending war. Great efforts were made to ease the burden on these men and their dependents. Among these, the Government generously provided family allotments, disability payments, and low-cost government insurance. Similarly the provisions under consideration here were adopted to assist soldiers who had bought insurance before entering the Army and did not require them to reimburse the Government.\n\n\n13\nAffirmed.\n\n\n14\nMr. Justice FRANKFURTER, Mr. Justice BURTON and Mr. Justice HARLAN dissent for the reasons given by Circuit Judge HUXMAN in United States v. Hendler, 10 Cir., 225 F.2d 106.\n\n\n\n1\n 54 Stat. 1183, 50 U.S.C.App. (1940 ed.) \u00a7 540, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 540.\n\n\n2\n Plesha brought suit against the Government to recover a dividend declared on his National Service Life Insurance policy. The Government attempted to offset the amount it had paid on his commercial insurance. The other respondents intervened to litigate the same basic issue.\n\n\n3\n We granted certiorari, 350 U.S. 1013, 76 S.Ct. 658, because this holding was in conflict with United States v. Hendler, 1 Cir., 225 F.2d 106.\n\n\n4\n The Government contends that such an obligation should be implied from the Act and from general principles of the common law particularly the doctrine that a guarantor who pays the debt of another is entitled to reimbursement. In regard to the common-law right of a guarantor, we are not persuaded from the record that the insured servicemen were indebted to the insurance companies for the wartime premiums either under the Act or the terms of their policies. Where no debt exists there is no basis for applying the common-law rules of guaranty. In any event, we would be very hesitant to infer a right to reimbursement from these servicemen in favor of the Government based on a common-law doctrine which was not referred to in the Act or in its congressional history. Cf. United States v. Gilman, 347 U.S. 507, 74 S.Ct. 695, 98 L.Ed. 898.\n\n\n5\n 40 Stat. 444. 'The only change in this article (insurance) relates to method of administration.' H.R.Rep.

The Government relies here on a discussion between Congressmen Voorhis and Arends during the House debates on the 1940 Act. 86 Cong.Rec., Part 12, 13132\u201413133. Apparently these gentlemen were not familiar with the specific provisions of the Act. This is not surprising since neither was a sponsor of the measure. Moreover, since the 1940 Act was a substantial reenactment of the 1918 Act, there were no committee hearings to inform congressmen of the precise scope and effect of the Act. As neither Mr. Voorhis nor Mr. Arends were lawyers, it cannot be assumed that they were aware of the technical common-law theory of guaranty which the Government relies on here. We think the Veterans' Administrator was correct in concluding that the legislative history, which includes the Voorhis-Arends colloquy, 'is of little, if any, help' to the Government's claim.\n\n\n7\n See Boone v. Lightner, 319 U.S. 561, 565, 63 S.Ct. 1223, 1226, 87 L.Ed. 1587.\n\n\n8\n 'If he comes back and wants to keep his insurance in effect, I take it the proposition here is that he must then pay the Government; but if he does not want to keep this policy in effect he still has the option to walk away and leave it.' Hearings before the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on S. 2859 and H.R. 6361, 65th Cong., 1st and 2d Sess. 135.\n\n\n9\n In closing the argument over requiring the soldiers to pay, the following colloquy took place between Major Wigmore and Senator Reed:\n'Senator Reed: * * * Now, do you think that would be undesirable, Major, or do you think it would be greatly to be preferred that the Government just carry the risk?\n'Maj. Wigmore: I can only speak for myself in that respect; but, speaking from my own judgment, it would seem to me that that is going further than this Nation ought to wish to go against its soldiers and sailors. * * *\n'Senator Reed: * * * You really think it is desirable that the Government should carry it, regardless of the attempt to reimburse itself out of the man's pay?\n'Maj. Wigmore: I only want to point out the fact that the Government, in the war-risk insurance bill * * * has offered to give Government insurance to soldiers and sailors at a rate of, I think, $8 a thousand, which I am told means that the Government pays the entire expenses of administration of that insurance * * * They have therefore contributed that already to soldiers and sailors in providing insurance. If the Government has gone that far, it seems to me it would be inconsistent with that, in principle, not to go this far.' Id., at 137\u2014138.\n\n\n10\n H.R.Rep. No. 181, 65th Cong., 1st Sess.\n\n\n11\n Id., at 8.\n\n\n12\n 'The amount paid by the United States to an insurer on account of applications approved under the provisions of this article, as amended, shall become a debt due to the United States by the insured on whose account payment was made * * *.' (Emphasis added.) 56 Stat. 775, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 546.\n\n\n13\n Letter of the Veterans' Administrator to the President of the Senate, appended to S.Rep. No. 716, 77th Cong., 1st Sess. 6.\n\n\n14\n Hearings before the House Committee on Military Affairs on H.R. 7029, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 38.\n\n\n15\n Even the Veterans' Administration stated in a formal decision in 1947 that:\n'Fairness compels admission that the legislative history of the 1942 act reflects a probable belief, though an incorrect one, on the part of the Seventy-seventh Congress that the 1940 act (passed by the Seventy-sixth Congress) had been construed as not giving rise to a debt owing by the insured to the Government upon the latter's payment to the insurer of the amount by which the premiums with interest exceeded the cash surrender value.' Decisions of the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs, No. 742 (April 1947), Vol. 1, Supp. 1, pp. 93, 103.\n\n\n16\n According to the Government's figures, 7,745 policies were brought within the protection of the 1918 Act; 476 of these policies were allowed to lapse. The total amount of back premiums paid by the Government on these policies was less than $20,000 or approximately $42 per policy, showing that Major Wigmore's prophecy as to the smallness of the Government's losses was a correct one. The Government sought reimbursement on only 10 of these 476 lapsed policies and total collections were $484.42. Records submitted show that all collections were obtained from soldiers who were still in the Army at the time they were called on to pay. The demands for payment went through regular military channels.\n\n\n17\n Apparently the first time the Veterans' Administration ever officially interpreted the Act as authorizing the Government to be reimbursed for its payment of premiums on lapsed policies was in Administrator's Decision No. 513, March 1, 1943. This decision held that the Government's agreement to carry policies under the 1940 Act was a 'gratuitous assumption of liability' which had been retroactively changed by the 1942 Amendment. Decisions of the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs, No. 513 (March 1943), Vol. 1, 781. However we agree with the view expressed in a later Administrator's Decision, No. 742, that a serviceman's liability under the 1940 Act must be determined under it and not under the 1942 Act. And see Lynch v. United States, 292 U.S. 571, 54 S.Ct. 840, 78 L.Ed. 1434.\n\n\n18\n Less than two months after the 1940 Act was passed, the Director of Insurance for the Veterans' Administration replying to a telegraphic inquiry stated that 'No provision is made in the Act for collecting from insured the amount paid by Government to insurer.' Shortly afterwards the Director made a similar statement to an insurance company representative.\nIn the meantime the Assistant Director made the following statement for publication in an insurance journal: 'There is no provision in the Act at this time for collecting from the insured the amount that the premium with interest may exceed the cash surrender value at the time of termination.' This same interpretation was given by the Assistant Director when testifying before the House Committee on Military Affairs in favor of the 1942 Amendment.

{"text":"401 U.S. 667\n91 S.Ct. 1160\n28 L.Ed.2d 404\nFred T. MACKEY, Petitioner,v.UNITED STATES.\nNo. 36.\nArgued Oct. 21, 1970.\nDecided April 5, 1971.\n\nSyllabus\nAt petitioner's trial for income tax evasion, the Government used monthly wagering tax forms petitioner had filed, as required by statute, to show that the gross amount of wagers he reported, less business expenses, exceeded the gambling profits reported on his income tax returns. Petitioner objected on the ground that the forms were prejudicial and irrelevant, but he was convicted in 1964 and the Court of Appeals affirmed. After this Court's 1968 decisions in Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889, and Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906, petitioner applied for postconviction relief on the ground that the Fifth Amendment barred the prosecution's use of the wagering tax forms. The District Court denied the application. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that Marchetti and Grosso would not be applied retroactively to overturn the earlier income tax evasion conviction based on the then-applicable constitutional principles. Held: The judgment is affirmed.\n411 F.2d 504, affirmed.\nMr. Justice WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice STEWART, and Mr. Justice BLACKMUN, concluded that Marchetti and Grosso are not to be applied retroactively, since no threat to the reliability of the factfinding process was involved in the use of the wagering tax forms at petitioner's trial. Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott, 382 U.S. 406, 86 S.Ct. 459, 15 L.Ed.2d 453; Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882; Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 28 L.Ed.2d 388. Pp. 1150\u20141153.\nMr. Justice HARLAN concluded that in this case, here on collateral review, the judgment should be affirmed, since he cannot say that the pre-Marchetti rule that prevailed at the time of petitioner's conviction, viz., that the registration requirement and obligation to pay the gambling tax did not violate the Fifth Amendment, was so grossly erroneous as to work an unexcusable inequity against petitioner and that the then-existing justification for that result (that persons could avoid self-incrimination by ceasing to engage in illegal activities) is not without some force. P. 1184.\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, joined by Mr. Justice MARSHALL, concluded that the Fifth Amendment does not bar the use of information that, in furtherance of the general scheme of collecting taxes and enforcing the tax laws, required those in the business of accepting wagers to report their income, a situation readily distinguishable from that in Marchetti and Grosso, where the Amendment was held to bar forced disclosure of information that would have subjected the individual concerned to the 'real and appreciable' hazard of self-incrimination for violating pervasive state or federal laws proscribing gambling. Pp. 703\u2014713.\nWilliam M. Ward for petitioner.\nMatthew J. Zinn for respondent.\nMr. Justice WHITE announced he judgment of the Court and an opinion in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice STEWART, and Mr. Justice BLACKMUN join.\n\n\n1\nAn indictment was returned in March 1963 charging petitioner Fred T. Mackey in five counts of evading payment of income taxes by willfully preparing and causing to be prepared false and fraudulent tax returns for the years 1956 through 1960, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201. On January 21, 1964, a jury in the District Court for the Northern District of Indiana found Mackey guilty on all five counts.1 The conviction was affirmed on appeal by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in the spring of 1965. 345 F.2d 499 (CA7), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 824, 86 S.Ct. 54, 15 L.Ed.2d 69 (1965).\n\n\n2\nAt petitioner's trial, the Government used the networth method to prove evasion of income taxes.2 As part of its case, it introduced 60 wagering excise tax returns\u2014one for every month of each of the five years covered by the indictment\u2014filed by petitioner pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4401. A summary exhibit prepared from these returns and petitioner's income tax returns were also introduced, and an Internal Revenue Service technical advisor testified that for the years in question the totals of the gross amount of wagers reported on the wagering tax returns, less the expenses of running petitioner's 'policy wheel' operation as reported on his annual income tax returns, exceeded the net profits from gambling reported on the petitioner's income tax returns. Defense counsel objected to the introduction of these exhibits, arguing that they were prejudicial, inflammatory, and irrelevant; the Government responded that the wagering tax returns and the summary exhibit were relevant because they showed a likely source of unreported income. The exhibits were admitted, and the Court of Appeals found, without specific discussion, no error in the ruling.3\n\n\n3\nOn January 29, 1968, this Court held that the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimiantion was a valid defense to a prosecution for failure to register as a gambler and to pay the related occupational and gambling excise taxes under 26 U.S.C. ss 4401, 4411, 4412. Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906 (1968). Petitioner, who had begun serving his sentence in December 1965, filed on February 12, 1968, a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate his sentence and set aside the judgment of conviction on authority of Marchetti and Grosso. The motion was denied by the District Court for the Northern District of Indiana,4 and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 411 F.2d 504 (CA7 1969).\n\n\n4\nAlthough the Court of Appeals suggested that petitioner's argument that he had not waived the Fifth Amendment claim by his failure to raise it at trial was open to question, 411 F.2d, at 506\u2014507, it specifically held that Marchetti and Grosso would not be applied retroactively to upset a pre-Marchetti conviction for evading payment of income tax simply because the wagering excise tax returns filed pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4401 were introduced in evidence at trial. Employing the threefold analysis set forth in our retroactivity decisions, see, e.g., Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 297, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 1970, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967), the Court of Appeals found that law enforcement officials had relied on the old rule, that retroactive application of Marchetti and Grosso in cases such as petitioner's would have a substantial impact on the administration of justice, and that '(t)he unreliability of the fact-finding process which is the touchstone of retroactivity is simply not threatened by the impersonal command of the wagering tax laws.' 411 F.2d at 509. We granted certiorari. 396 U.S. 954, 90 S.Ct. 426, 24 L.Ed.2d 419.\n\n\n5\n* In United States v. Kahriger, 345 U.S. 22, 73 S.Ct. 510, 97 L.Ed. 754 (1953), a prosecution for failure to register and pay the gambling tax, this Court held that the registration requirement and the obligation to pay the gambling tax did not violate the Fifth Amendment. The Court construed the privilege as relating 'only to past acts, not to future acts that may or may not be committed. * * * Under the registration provisions of the wagering tax, appellee is not compelled to confess to acts already committed, he is merely informed by the statute that in order to engage in the business of wagering in the future he must fulfill certain conditions.' 345 U.S., at 32\u201433, 73 S.Ct., at 515. Lewis v. United States, 348 U.S. 419, 75 S.Ct. 415, 99 L.Ed. 475 (1955), reaffirmed this construction of the Fifth Amendment. Thirteen years later we could not agree with what was deemed an 'excessively narrow' view of the scope of the privilege. 390 U.S., at 52, 88 S.Ct., at 704. The 'force of the constitutional prohibition is (not) diminished merely because confession of a guilty purpose precedes the act which it is subsequently employed to evidence.' 390 U.S., at 54, 88 S.Ct., at 705. The gambling registration and tax requirements were held to present substantial risks of self-incrimination and therefore to be unenforceable; imposition of criminal penalties for noncompliance was an impermissible burden on the exercise of the privilege.\n\n\n6\nUntil Marchetti and Grosso, then, the registration and gambling tax provisions had the express approval of this Court; the Fifth Amendment provided no defense to a criminal prosecution for failure to comply. But as of January 29, 1968, the privilege was expanded to excuse noncompliance. The statutory requirement to register and file gambling tax returns was held to compel self-incrimination and the privilege became a complete defense to a criminal prosecution for failure to register and pay the related taxes. It followed that the registration and excise tax returns filed in response to the statutory command were compelled statements within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment and accordingly were inadmissible in evidence as part of the prosecution's case in chief. The question before us is whether the Marchetti-Grosso rule applies retroactively and invalidates Mackey's conviction because his gambling excise tax returns were introduced against him at his trial for income tax evasion.\n\n\n7\nWe have today reaffirmed the nonretroactivity of decisions overruling prior constructions of the Fourth Amendment. Williams v. United States and Elkanich v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 28 L.Ed.2d 388. The decision in those cases represents the approach to the question of when to accord retroactive sweep to a new constitutional rule taken by this Court in the line of cases from Linkletter5 in 1965 to Desist6 in 1969. Among those cases were two which determined that earlier decisions extending the reach of the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination would not be retroactively applied to invalidate prior convictions that in all respects conformed to the then-controlling law.\n\n\n8\nIn Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott, 382 U.S. 406, 86 S.Ct. 459, 15 L.Ed.2d 453 (1966), the Court declined to apply the rule of Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965), to prisoners seeking collateral relief. Griffin had construed the Fifth Amendment to forbid comment on defendants' failure to testify, thereby removing a burden from the exercise of the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination and further implementing its purpose. The basic purpose of the privilege, we said, was not related to 'protecting the innocent from conviction,' 382 U.S., at 415, 86 S.Ct., at 464, the privilege 'is not an adjunct to the ascertainment of truth,' but is aimed at serving the complex of values on which it was historically rested. 382 U.S., at 416, 86 S.Ct., at 465. Given this purpose, clear reliance on the pre-Griffin rules, and the frustration of state interests which retroactivity would have entailed, we refused relief to a state prisoner seeking collateral relief although the prosecutor's comment on his failure to take the stand at his trial would have infringed the new rule that was announced in Griffin and was being applied in contemporary trials.\n\n\n9\nJohnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966), reaffirmed this view of the Fifth Amendment by declining to apply the Miranda7 rules to cases pending on direct review as well as to those involving applications for collateral relief. Stating that the 'prime purpose of these rulings is to guarantee full effectuation of the privilege against self-incrimination, the mainstay of our adversary system of criminal justice,' 384 U.S., at 729, 86 S.Ct., at 1779, the Court also recognized that the new rules to some extent did guard against the possibility of unreliable admissions given during custodial interrogation. Id., at 730, 86 S.Ct., at 1779. The question, however, was one of 'probabilities.' The hazard of untrustworthy results in past trials was not sufficient apparent to require retroactive application in view of the existing, well-defined remedies against the use of many involuntary confessions, the obvious fact that the new warnings had not been standard practice prior to Miranda, and the consequent disruption to the administration of the criminal law.\n\nII\n\n10\nGuided by our decisions dealing with the retroactivity of new constitutional interpretations of the broad language of the Bill of Rights, we agree with the Court of Appeals that Marchetti and Grosso should not have any retroactive effect on Mackey's conviction. Petitioner was convicted in strict accordance with then-applicable constitutional norms. Mackey would have a significant claim only if Marchetti and Grosso must be given full retroactive sweep. But in overruling Kahriger and Lewis, the Court's purpose was to provide for a broader implementation of the Fifth Amendment privilege\u2014a privilege that does not include at its core a concern for improving the reliability of the results reached at criminal trials. There is no indication in Marchetti or Grosso that one of the considerations which moved the Court to hold that the Congress could not constitutionally compel citizens to register as gamblers and file related tax returns wjas the probable unreliability of such statements once given. Petitioner has not advanced any objective considerations suggesting such unreliability. The wagering tax returns introduced in evidence at his trial have none of the characteristics, and hence none of the potential unreliability, of coerced confessions produced by 'overt and obvious coercion.' Johnson, 384 U.S., at 730, 86 S.Ct., at 1779. Nor does Mackey suggest that his returns\u2014made under oath\u2014were inaccurate in any respect.8 Thus, a gambling excise tax return, like physical evidence seized in violation of a new interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, is concededly relevant and probative even though obtained by the Government through means since defined by this Court as constitutionally objectionable. As in Desist, Elkanich, and Williams, the result here should be that a pre-Marchetti trial in which the Government employed such evidence is not set aside through retroactive application of the new constitutional principle.\n\n\n11\nThe short of the matter is that Marchetti and Grosso raise not the slightest doubt about the accuracy of the verdict of guilt returned here. Under these circumstances, the principles represented by Elkanich and Williams, as well as by Tehan and Johnson, must control. For Tehan and Johnson indicate that even though decisions reinterpreting the Fifth Amendment may create marginal doubts as to the accuracy of the results of past trials, the purposes of those decisions are adequately served by prospective application. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n\n12\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n13\nJudgment affirmed.\n\n\n14\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in the judgments in Nos. 36 and 82 and dissenting in No. 81.\n\n\n15\nThese three cases have one question in common: the extent to which new constitutional rules prescribed by this Court for the conduct of criminal cases are applicable to other such cases which were litigated under different but then-prevailing constitutional rules.\n\n\n16\nOne of these cases is before us on direct review, No. 81, Williams, the other two being here on collateral review, No. 82, Elkanich, and No. 36, Mackey. In each instance the new rule is held not applicable, and, in consequence, the judgments below are affirmed, without reaching the merits of the underlying questions presented. Two of the cases, Williams and Elkanich, involve the Court's decision in Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752 (1969), changing the rule as to the scope of permissible searches and seizures incident to a lawful arrest. The other case, Mackey, involves the Court's decisions in Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 62 (1968), and Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62 (1968), changing the rule as to application of the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to criminal prosecutions arising under the federal gambling tax statutes.\n\n\n17\nToday's decisions mark another milestone in the development of the Court's \"retroactivity\" doctrine, which came into being somewhat less than six years ago in Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618 (1965). That doctrine was the product of the Court's disquietude with the impacts of its fast-moving pace of constitutional innovation in the criminal field. Some members of the Court, and I have come to regret that I was among them, initially grasped this doctrine as a way of limiting the reach of decisions that seemed to them fundamentally unsound. Others rationalized this resort to prospectivity as a \"technique\" that provided an \"impetus ... for the implementation of long overdue reforms, which otherwise could not be practicably effected.\" Jenkins v. Delaware, 395 U.S. 213, 281 (1969). The upshot of this confluence of viewpoints was that the subsequent course of Linkletter became almost as difficult to follow as the tracks made by a beast of prey in search of its intended victim. See my dissenting opinion in Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 256-257 (1969). See also United States v. United States Coin & Currency, post, p. 728 (appendix to concurring opinion of BRENNAN, J.). It was this train of events that impelled me to suggest two Terms ago in Desist that the time had come for us to pause to consider just where these haphazard developments might be leading us. That is what I had thought underlay the taking of these cases, and their companions, United States v. United States Coin & Currency, post, p. 715, and Hill v. California, post, p. 797. Regrettably, however, this opportunity has largely eventuated in little more than a reaffirmation of the post-Linkletter developments.\n\n\n18\nWhat emerges from today's decisions is that in the realm of constitutional adjudication in the criminal field the Court is free to act, in effect, like a legislature, making its new constitutional rules wholly or partially retroactive or only prospective as it deems wise. I completely disagree with this point of view. While I do not subscribe to the Blackstonian theory that the law should be taken to have always been what it is said to mean at a later time, I do believe that whether a new constitutional rule is to be given retroactive or simply prospective effect must be determined upon principles that comport with the judicial function, and not upon considerations that are appropriate enough for a legislative body.\n\n\n19\n* At the outset, I think it is clear that choosing a binding, generally applicable interpretation of the Constitution presents a problem wholly different from that of choosing whether to apply the rule so evolved \"retroactively\" to other cases arising on direct review.\n\n\n20\nIn adopting a particular constitutional principle, this Court very properly weighs the nature and purposes of various competing alternatives, including the extent to which a proposed rule will enhance the integrity of the criminal process and promote the efficient administration of justice, as well as the extent to which justifiable expectations have grown up surrounding one rule or another. Indeed, it is this very process of weighing such factors that should constitute the core of our task in giving concrete embodiment to those constitutional commands that govern the procedures by which the State and Federal Governments enforce their criminal laws.\n\n\n21\nBut we posses this awesome power of judicial review, this duty to bind coordinate branches of the federal system with our view of what the Constitution dictates, only because we are a court of law, an appellate court charged with the responsibility of adjudicating cases or controversies according to the law of the land and because the law applicable to any such dispute necessarily includes the Federal Constitution. That is the classic explanation for the basis of judicial review, an explanation first put forth by Chief Justice Marshall in Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177-178 (1803), and from that day to this the sole continuing rationale for the exercise of this judicial power:\n\n\n22\n\"Certainly all those who have framed written      constitutions contemplate them as forming the fundamental and      paramount law of the nation ....\n\n\n23\n. . . . .\n\n\n24\n\"It is emphatically the province and duty of the      judicial department to say what the law is. Those who apply      the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and      interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other,      the courts must decide on the operation of each.\n\n\n25\n. . . . .\n\n\n26\n\"If then the courts are to regard the constitution; and      the constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the      legislature; the constitution, and not such ordinary act,      must govern the case to which they both apply.\"\n\n\n27\nWe announce new constitutional rules, then, only as a correlative of our dual duty to decide those cases over which we have jurisdiction and to apply the Federal Constitution as one source of the matrix of governing legal rules. We cannot release criminals from jail merely because we think one case is a particularly appropriate one in which to apply what reads like a general rule of law or in order to avoid making new legal norms through promulgation of dicta. This serious interference with the corrective process is justified only by necessity, as part of our task of applying the Constitution to cases before us. Simply fishing one case from the stream of appellate review, using it as a vehicle for pronouncing new constitutional standards, and then permitting a stream of similar cases subsequently to flow by unaffected by that new rule constitute an indefensible departure from this model of judicial review.\n\n\n28\nIf we do not resolve all cases before us on direct review in light of our best understanding of governing constitutional principles, it is difficult to see why we should so adjudicate any case at all. If there is no need for an anti-majoritarian judicial control over the content of our legal system in nine cases precisely like that presented by Mr. Chimel's dispute with the State of California, it is hard to see the necessity, wisdom, or justification for imposing that control in the Chimel case itself. In truth, the Court's assertion of power to disregard current law in adjudicating cases before us that have not already run the full course of appellate review, is quite simply an assertion that our constitutional function is not one of adjudication but in effect of legislation. We apply and definitively interpret the Constitution, under this view of our role, not because we are bound to, but only because we occasionally deem it appropriate, useful, or wise. That sort of choice may permissibly be made by a legislature or a council of revision, but not by a court of law.\n\n\n29\nThe notion that cases before us on direct review need not be adjudicated in accordance with those legal principles governing at the time we are possessed of jurisdiction in the case entails additional significant untoward consequences. By this doctrine all other courts in this country are, in effect, reduced largely to the role of automatons, directed by us to apply mechanistically all then-settled federal constitutional concepts to every case before them. No longer do the inferior courts -- and, in the constitutional realm, all courts are inferior to us -- bear responsibility for developing or interpreting the Constitution. For it is a necessary corollary of this current retroactivity doctrine that an inferior court errs when it arrives at a result which this Court subsequently adopts but later decides must operate prospectively only. See my dissent in Desist, 394 U.S., at 259. Cf. United States v. White, post, p. 754 (Part II), and my dissenting opinion in that case, post, p. 768. See also United States v. United States Coin & Currency, post, p. 730 (WHITE, J., dissenting). Although it is necessary for the proper functioning of the federal system that this Court possess the last word on issues of federal constitutional law, it is intolerable that we take to ourselves the sole ability to speak to such problems.\n\n\n30\nRefusal to apply new constitutional rules to all cases arising on direct review may well substantially deter those whose financial resources are barely sufficient to withstand the costs of litigating to this Court, or attorneys who are willing to make sacrifices to perform their professional obligation in its broadest sense, from asserting rights bottomed on constitutional interpretations different from those currently prevailing in this Court. More importantly, it tends to cut this Court loose from the force of precedent, allowing us to restructure artificially those expectations legitimately created by extant law and thereby mitigate the practical force of stare decisis, Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. at 644 (BLACK, J., dissenting) a force which out properly to bear on the judicial resolution of any legal problem. Cf. Moragne v. States Marine Lines, 398 U.S. 375, 403 (1970).\n\n\n31\nOne could catalogue virtually ad infinitum what I view as unacceptable ancillary consequences of this aspect of the Court's ambulatory retroactivity doctrine. For me, the fact that this doctrine entails an inexplicable and unjustifiable departure from the basic principle upon which rests the institution of judicial review is sufficient to render it untenable. I continue to believe that a proper perception of our duties as a court of law, charged with applying the Constitution to resolve every legal dispute within our jurisdiction on direct review, mandates that we apply the law as it is at the time, not as it once was. Inquiry into the nature, purposes, and scope of a particular constitutional rule is essential to the task of deciding whether that rule should be made the law of the land. That inquiry is, however, quite simply irrelevant in deciding, once a rule has been adopted as part of our legal fabric, which cases then pending in this Court should be governed by it.\n\nII\n\n32\nOf the cases presently under discussion, only Williams involves direct review of a nonfinal criminal judgment. The other two, Elkanich and Mackey, were brought here by persons in federal custody, seeking release through issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. At the time their convictions became final, there was no constitutional error in the conviction of either. Since that time subsequent decisions of this Court have formulated new constitutional rules that invalidate the procedures like those involved in their trials.\n\n\n33\nWhile, as I have just stated, I think it clear what law should be applied to nonfinal convictions here on direct review, the choice of law problem as it applies to cases here on habeas seems to me a much more difficult one. However, that choice, in my view, is also one that can be responsibly made only by focusing, in the first instance, on the nature, function, and scope of the adjudicatory process in which such cases arise. The relevant frame of reference, in other words, is not the purpose of the new rule whose benefit the petitioner seeks, but instead the purposes for which the writ of habeas corpus is made available.\n\n\n34\nAs I first pointed out in my dissent in Desist, 394 U.S., at 260-261, this Court's function in reviewing a decisions allowing or disallowing a writ of habeas corpus is, and always has been, significantly different from our role in reviewing on direct appeal the validity of nonfinal criminal convictions. While the entire theoretical underpinnings of judicial review and constitutional supremacy dictate that federal courts having jurisdiction on direct review adjudicate every issue of law, including federal constitutional issues, fairly implicated by the trial process below and properly presented on appeal, federal courts have never had a similar obligation on habeas corpus.\n\n\n35\nHabeas corpus always has been a collateral remedy, providing an avenue for upsetting judgments that have become otherwise final. It is not designed as a substitute for direct review. The interest in leaving concluded litigation in a state of repose, that is, reducing the controversy to a final judgment not subject to further judicial revision, may quite legitimately be found by those responsible for defining the scope of the writ to outweigh in some, many, or most instances the competing interest in readjudicating convictions according to all legal standards in effect when a habeas petition is filed. Indeed, this interest in finality might well lead to a decision to exclude completely certain legal issues, whether or not properly determined under the law prevailing at the time of trial, from the cognizance of courts administering this collateral remedy. This has always been the case with collateral attacks on final civil judgments.2 More immediately relevant here is the fact that prior to Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443 (1953), federal courts would never consider the merits of a constitutional claim raised on habeas if the petitioner had a fair opportunity to raise his arguments in the original criminal proceeding, see my dissent in Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 449-463, (1963), unless the petitioner attacked the constitutionality of the federal, Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371 (1880), or state, Crowley v. Christensen, 137 U.S. 86 (1890), statute under which he had been convicted. See generally Bator, Finality in Criminal Law and Federal Habeas Corpus for State Prisoners, 76 Harv. L. Rev. 441, 463 (1963); Note, Developments in the Law -- Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 1040, 1042-1062 (1970).\n\n\n36\nThus, prior to Brown v. Allen, it must have been crystal clear that the \"retroactivity\" of a new constitutional rule was a function of the scope and purposes of the habeas corpus writ. Absent unusual circumstances, a new rule was not cognizable on habeas simply because of the limited scope of the writ. While the extent of inquiry into alleged constitutional error on habeas has been drastically expanded in the past 20 years, the retroactivity problem remains analytically constant. In my view, the issues respectively presented by the two cases I treat here that arise on collateral review (Elkanich and Mackey) -- whether the new rules of the Chimel case and the Marchetti and Grosso cases should be applied \"retroactively\" -- must be considered as none other than a problem as to the scope of the habeas writ. We can properly decline to apply the Chimel rule, or the principles of Marchetti and Grosso, to the present cases only if that is consistent with the reasons for the provision, in our federal legal system, of a habeas corpus proceeding to test the validity of an individual's official confinement.\n\n\n37\nThus I am led to make some inquiry into the purposes of habeas. At the outset I must note that this faces me with difficult problems, I have consistently protested a long course of habeas decisions in this Court which, I still believe, constitute an unsound extension of the historic scope of the writ and an unfortunate display of insensitivity to the principles of federalism which underlie the American legal system. See, e.g., Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 448 (1963); Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 23 (1963); Kaufman v. United States, 394 U.S. 217, 242 (1969); Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 325 (1963) (STEWART, J., dissenting). If I felt free to decide the present cases consistently with my own views of the legitimate role of the Great Writ, I should have little difficulty. But as my views on this score have not commended themselves to most of my Brethren, I feel obliged to approach these two collateral cases within the framework of current habeas corpus doctrine. This is not an easy exercise, for present habeas corpus decisions provide little assistance in fathoming the underlying understanding of habeas corpus upon which these decisions have been premised. The short of the matter is that this Court has in recent times yet to produce any considered, coherent statement of the general purposes of habeas. In considering the problem of \"retroactivity\" on direct review, it is possible to work from a general classic theory of judicial review, but while the specific uses of the habeas writ have greatly multiplied, the earlier perception of its general metes and bounds have been swallowed up and gone unreplaced. About the only way to proceed is to work from the bottom up, ascertaining fist which issues are cognizable on habeas, and which are not, and thereafter inferring what must be thought to be the nature of the writ.\n\n\n38\nI start with the proposition that habeas lies to inquire into every constitutional defect in any criminal trial, where the petitioner remains \"in custody\" because of the judgment in that trial, unless the error committed was knowingly and deliberately waived or constitutes mere harmless error. That seems to be the implicit premise of Brown v. Allen, supra, and the clear purport of Kaufman v. United States, supra. This not to say, however, that the function of habeas corpus is to provide a federal forum for determining whether any individual is presently \"in custody in violation of the constitution ... of the United States,\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (1964 ed., Supp. V), in the sense that the basis for his incarceration would, under the law existing at the time a petition is filed or adjudicated, as distinguished from the law that was applicable at the time his conviction became final, be held free of constitutional error. Cf. Meador, Habeas Corpus and the \"Retroactivity\" Illusion, 50 Va. L. Rev. 1115 (1964).\n\n\n39\nWhile it has been generally, although not universally, assumed that habeas courts should apply current constitutional law to habeas petitioners before them, I do not believe this is or should be the correct view. First, no such proposition has ever been squarely considered and embraced by this Court, at least since the recent proliferation of criminal defendants' protected constitutional rights and the concomitant expansion of the writ. Moreover, applying current constitutional standards to convictions finalized while different views were ascendant appears unnecessary to achieve the ends sought by Brown and Kaufman. The primary justification given by the Court for extending the scope of habeas to all alleged constitutional errors is that it provides a quasi-appellate review function, forcing trial and appellate courts in both the federal and state system to toe the constitutional mark. See Kaufman v. United States, 394 U.S., at 226. However, the opinion in Kaufman itself concedes that there is no need to apply new constitutional rules on habeas to serve the interests promoted by that decision. 394 U.S. at 229. Further, as I explain in the margin below, Congress, in at least one significant regard, seems plainly to have disapproved the notion that supervening constitutional interpretation ought to apply on habeas involving state convictions.\n\n\n40\nClearly, it is at least fair to regard this issue as not yet settled by this Court. Consequently, I go on to inquire how it ought to be resolved. For me, with a few exceptions, the relevant competing policies properly balance out to the conclusion that, given the current broad scope of constitutional issues cognizable on habeas, it is sounder, in adjudicating habeas petitions, generally to apply the law prevailing at the time a conviction became final than it is to seek to dispose of all these cases on the basis of intervening changes in constitutional interpretation.\n\n\n41\nI do not mean to neglect the force of countervailing contentions. Assuring every state and federal prisoner a forum in which he can continually litigate the current constitutional validity of the basis for his conviction tends to assure a uniformity of ultimate treatment among prisoners; provides a method of correcting abuses now, but not formerly, perceived as severely detrimental to societal interests; and tends to promote a rough form of justice, albeit belated, in the sense that current constitutional notions, it may be hoped, ring more 'correct' or 'just' than those they discarded.\n\n\n42\nIn my view, however, these interests are too easily overstated. Some discrimination must always exist in the legal treatment of criminal convicts within a system where the governing law is continuously subject to change. And it has been the law, presumably for at least as long as anyone currently in jail has been incarcerated, that procedures utilized to convict them must have been fundamentally fair, that is, in accordance with the command of the Fourteenth Amendment that '(n)o State shall * * * deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.' Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78, 29 S.Ct. 14, 53 L.Ed. 97 (1908). Moreover, it is too easy to suggest that constitutional updating is necessary in order to assure that the system arrives only at 'correct' results. By hypothesis, a final conviction, state or federal, has been adjudicated by a court cognizant of the Federal Constitution and duty bound to apply it. To argue that a conclusion reached by one of these 'inferior' courts is somehow forever erroneous because years later this Court took a different view of the relevant constitutional command carries more emotional than analytic force. No one has put this point better than Mr. Justice Jackson, in his concurring opinion in Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S., at 540, 73 S.Ct., at 427:\n\n\n43\n'(R)eversal by a higher court is not proof that justice is      thereby better done. There is no doubt that if there were a      super-Supreme Court, a substantial proportion of our      reversals of state courts would also be reversed. We are not      final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only      because we are final.'\n\n\n44\nMore importantly, there are operative competing policies in this area which I regard as substantial. It is, I believe, a matter of fundamental import that there be a visible end to the litigable aspect of the criminal process. Finality in the criminal law is an end which must always be kept in plain view. See, e.g., Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S., at 445, 83 S.Ct., at 852 (Clark, J., dissenting); Spencer v. Texas, 385 U.S. 554, 583, 87 S.Ct. 648, 663, 17 L.Ed.2d 606 (1967) (Warren, C.J., concurring and dissenting). See also Bator, finality in Criminal Law and Federal Habeas Corpus for State Prisoners, 76 Harv.L.Rev. 441 (1963); Friendly, Is Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Criminal Judgments, 38 U.Chi.L.Rev. 142, 146\u2014151 (1970). As I have stated before, 'Both the individual criminal defendant and society have an interest in insuring that there will at some point be the certainty that comes with an end to litigation, and that attention will ultimately be focused not on whether a conviction was free from error but rather on whether the prisoner can be restored to a useful place in the community.' Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S., at 24\u201425, 83 S.Ct., at 1082 (Harlan, J., dissenting). At some point, the criminal process, if it is to function at all, must turn its attention from whether a man ought properly to be incarcerated to how he is to be treated once convicted. If law, criminal or otherwise, is worth having and enforcing, it must at some time provide a definitive answer to the question litigants present or else it never provides an answer at all. Surely it is an unpleasant task to strip a man of his freedom and subject him to institutional restraints. But this does not mean that in so doing, we should always be halting or tentative. No one, not criminal defendants, not the judicial system, not society as a whole is benefited by a judgment providing a man shall tentatively go to jail today, but tomorrow and every day thereafter his continued incarceration shall be subject to fresh litigation on issues already resolved.\n\n\n45\nA rule of law that fails to take account of these finality interests would do more than subvert the criminal process itself. It would also seriously distort the very limited resources society has allocated to the criminal process. While men languish in jail, not uncommonly for over a year, awaiting a first trial on their guilt or innocence, it is not easy to justify expending substantial quantities of the time and energies of judges, prosecutors, and defense lawyers litigating the validity under present law of criminal convictions that were perfectly free from error when made final. See Friendly, supra, at 148\u2014149. This drain on society's resources is compounded by the fact that issuance of the habeas writ compels a State that wishes to continue enforcing its laws against the successful petitioner to relitigate facts buried in the remote past through presentation of witnesses whose memories of the relevant events often have dimmed. This very act of trying stale facts may well, ironically, produce a second trial no more reliable as a matter of getting at the truth than the first. See Amsterdam, Search, Seizure, and Section 2255: A Comment, 112 U.Pa.L.Rev. 378, 384 (1964).\n\n\n46\nIn sum, while the case for continually inquiring into the current constitutional validity of criminal convictions on collateral attack is not an insubstantial one, it is by no means overwhelming. Most interests such a doctrine would serve will be adequately protected by the current rule that all constitutional errors not waived or harmless are correctible on habeas and by defining such errors according to the law in effect when a conviction became final. Those interests not served by this intermediate position are, in my view, largely overridden by the interests in finality.\n\n\n47\nAlthough not necessary to the resolution of either of the two collateral cases now here, for sake of completeness I venture to add that I would make two exceptions to this general principle. First, the above discussion is written only with new 'procedural due process' rules in mind, that is, those applications of the Constitution that forbid the Government to utilize certain techniques or processes in enforcing concededly valid societal proscriptions on individual behavior.6 New 'substantive due process' rules, that is, those that place, as a matter of constitutional interpretation, certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe,7 must, in my view, be placed on a different footing. As I noted above, the writ has historically been available for attacking convictions on such grounds.8 This, I believe, is because it represents the clearest instance where finality interests should yield. There is little societal interest in permitting the criminal process to rest at a point where it ought properly never to repose. Moreover, issuance of the writ on substantive due process grounds entails none of the adverse collateral consequences of retrial I have described above. Thus, the obvious interest in freeing individuals from punishment for conduct that is constitutionally protected seems to me sufficiently substantial to justify applying current notions of substantive due process to petitions for habeas corpus. See generally Part II of my opinion for the Court in United States v. United States Coin & Currency, 401 U.S. 722, 91 S.Ct. 1045.\n\n\n48\nSecondly, I think the writ ought always to lie for claims of nonobservance of those procedures that, as so aptly described by Mr. Justice Cardozo in Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325, 58 S.Ct. 149, 152, 82 L.Ed. 288 (1937), are 'implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.' Typically, it should be the case that any conviction free from federal constitutional error at the time it became final, will be found, upon reflection, to have been fundamentally fair and conducted under those procedures essential to the substance of a full hearing. However, in some situations in might be that time and growth in social capacity, as well as judicial perceptions of what we can rightly demand of the adjudicatory process, will properly alter our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements that must be found to vitiate the fairness of a particular conviction. For example, such, in my view, is the case with the right to counsel at trial now held a necessary condition precedent to any conviction for a serious crime. See my separate opinion in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 349, 83 S.Ct. 792, 799, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), where I concurred in conferring this right on a state prisoner, seeking state habeas corpus, on the grounds that this 'new' rule was mandated by Palko. Hence, I would continue to apply Gideon itself on habeas, even to convictions made final before that decision was rendered. Other possible exceptions to the finality rule I would leave to be worked out in the context of actual cases brought before us that raise the issue.\n\n\n49\nSubsequent reflection upon what I wrote in Desist, where I undertook to expose in a preliminary way some of the considerations I thought ought to govern the problem of deciding which, if any, new constitutional rules should be held cognizable in habeas proceedings, leads me to these additional observations. There I tentatively suggested we might apply those new rules that 'significantly improve the pre-existing fact-finding procedures' mandated by the Federal Constitution. 394 U.S., at 262, 89 S.Ct., at 1041. Cf. Mishkin, The Supreme Court 1964 Term-Foreword: The High Court, The Great Writ, and the Due Process of Time and Law, 79 Harv.L.Rev. 56, 77\u2014101 (1965). As indicated above, I am now persuaded that those new rules cognizable on habeas ought to be defined, not by the 'truth-determining' test, but by the Palko test. My reasons are several. First, adherence to precedent, particularly Kaufman v. United States, must ineluctably lead one to the conclusion that it is not a principal purpose of the writ to inquire whether a criminal convict did in fact commit the deed alleged. Additionally, recent decisions of this Court, e.g., Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970), have revealed just how marginally effective are some new rules purportedly aimed at improving the factfinding process. I cannot believe that the interest in finality is always outweighed by the interests protected in cases like Coleman. Cf. Spencer v. Texas, 385 U.S., at 583, 87 S.Ct., at 663 (Warren, C.J., concurring and dissenting). I believe Palko more correctly marks the tipping point of finality interests, not only in terms of divining which new rules should apply on habeas, but also in its reminder that a particular rule may be more or less crucial to the fairness of a case depending on its own factual setting. Finally, I find inherently intractable the purported distinction between those new rules that are designed to improve the factfinding process and those designed principally to further other values. For a perfect example, note the plurality's difficulty today in explaining, on that basis, retroactivity decisions such as Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966); Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967); and DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U.S. 631, 88 S.Ct. 2093, 20 L.Ed.2d 1308 (1968). Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, at 655\u2014656, n. 7, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 1153, 28 L.Ed.2d 388.\n\n\n50\nSecondly, in Desist I went to some lengths to point out the inevitable difficulties that will arise in attempting 'to determine whether a particular decision has really announced a 'new' rule at all or whether it has simply applied a wellestablished constitutional principle to govern a case which is closely analogous to those which have been previously considered in the prior case law.' 394 U.S., at 263, 89 S.Ct., at 1041. See generally id., at 263\u2014269, 89 S.Ct., at 1041\u20141044. I remain fully cognizant of these problems and realize they will produce some difficulties in administering the writ, but believe they would be greatly ameliorated by adequate recognition of the principle of finality in the operation of the criminal process.\n\nIII\n\n51\nI realize, of course, that this opinion, which is already unfortunately lengthy, has thus far not been directly responsive to the plurality opinions announced in these cases. Essentially this is because I do not perceive the issues raised by these cases from the same perspective as my Brethren. Certain aspects of the other opinions announced today do, however, fairly call for a response both because they contain some small seeds of a challenge to what I have said above and because I think, with respect, that what is written today by some of those who would give virtually unlimited sweep to this 'retroactivity' doctrine strikingly illuminates the faulty premises of the thinking in this entire field.\n\n\n52\nIn the plurality opinions in Williams and Elkanich, and Mackey the only challenge I perceive to my views is the single assertion that my analysis is untenable because unsupported by precedent. Williams v. United States, 401 U.S., at 651\u2014652, 91 S.Ct., at 1151\u20141152. Truly, this is a remarkable claim. For Linkletter v. Walker, supra, the wellspring of the current retroactivity doctrine, took as its point of departure the very distinction between direct review and collateral attack which I have argued is crucial to any analysis in this field, a distinction which the Court now firmly discards.\n\n\n53\nFurther, as the dissenting opinion in United States v. United States Coin & Currency, 401 U.S., at 735, 91 S.Ct., at 1052, points out, in an analogous situation, the legislative repeal of a criminal statute, 'the judge-made rule was that those whose convictions had been finally affirmed when repeal took place received no benefit from the new rule; but repeal of a statute abated pending prosecutions and required reversal of convictions still on appeal when the law was changed.' In other words, the precise distinction I have urged between direct review and collateral attack, based not on the nature of the act of changing the law or of the new law thus pronounced but, instead, on the nature of the adjudicatory context in which the claim of legal error was presented has consistently been the model for the judicial process. Indeed, it would seem that the only precedential support for the position that prevails today is that conflicting and confusing flurry of 'retroactivity' opinions that commenced less than five years ago with Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966).\n\n\n54\nOther aspects of the dissent in Coin & Currency, supra, might, it seems to me, be construed as a further challenge to the views I have expressed here since that opinion is subscribed to by a majority of those members of the Court who have determined that, for purposes of deciding whether new search and seizure rules apply to subsequent cases arising in federal courts, the process invoked by the litigants is irrelevant. In any event, I find the implications of the analysis underlying that dissent startling. For example, that Congress currently provides that statutory repeal shall not abate pending prosecutions or require reversal of nonfinal convictions seems to me a singularly unhelpful bit of information. We sit as a court of law, not a council of revision. Our powers of judicial review are judicial, not legislative, in nature. The assertion that this evidence is relevant data for resolving the problems at hand serves at best only to make explicit that which I have attempted to demonstrate in Part I of this opinion\u2014that the retroactivity analysis currently ascendant in this Court proceeds on the false and unacceptable premise that constitutional interpretation is not purely a judicial, but, rather, something akin to a legislative, process. If, in fact, that premise is true we ought not to be writing retroactivity opinions but instead relinquishing some of our powers of judicial review.\n\n\n55\nThe dissenting opinion attempts to palliate its invocation of the legislative process by alternately suggesting that the typical statutory rule is, because widespread, part of our fabric of 'positive law' and the issue, therefore, is whether this Court should carry this policy over to the realm of constitutional interpretation. Three cases are cited that allegedly reveal we are not foreclosed from taking this course. The short answer to all this remains the same: the distinction between judicial and legislative power is equally woven deeply into the fabric of our positive law. So, too, is the notion that this Court definitively interprets the Constitution only because its role as a court of law requires it to do so. It is not surprising, then, to discover upon closer analysis that the cited cases do not bear the heavy weight placed on them. Gelpcke v. City of Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175, 17 L.Ed. 520 (1864), holds only that state courts may be compelled in some situations by particular provisions of the Federal Constitution to apply certain new rules prospectively only. No such claim has ever been made about these new constitutional rules of criminal procedure. Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., 287 U.S. 358, 53 S.Ct. 145, 77 L.Ed. 360 (1932), merely holds that the Federal Constitution imposes no barrier to a state court's decision to apply a new state commonlaw rule prospectively only. Is it not sufficient answer to the dissenters' final assertion of precedential support to point out that Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank, 308 U.S. 371, 60 S.Ct. 317, 84 L.Ed. 329 (1940), was a collateral attack on a civil judgment already otherwise final and entitled to res judicata effect? And, further, that it was written by the same Chief Justice, Hughes, who had held six years earlier in United States v. Chambers, 291 U.S. 217, 54 S.Ct. 434, 78 L.Ed. 763 (1934), that repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment abated all prosecutions begun, and required reversal on direct review of all convictions obtained, under statutes dependent for their constitutionality on the repealed amendment, yet did not affect final convictions so obtained?\n\nIV\n\n56\nBecause my comprehension of the relevant issues diverges so substantially from that of the Court it is necessary for me to discuss separately my view as to the proper disposition of each of these three cases.\n\nA.\n\n57\nWilliams v. United States (direct review). As this case is here on direct review, I would apply to its resolution the rule enunciated in Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685. The plurality correctly describes the salient facts in this case at n. 2 of its opinion, 401 U.S., at 650\u2014651, 91 S.Ct., at 1151, and I agree they plainly reveal a violation of Chimel. Indeed, the Ninth Circuit panel below, although it held Chimel nonretroactive, explicitly found the search here involved inconsistent with the dictates of Chimel. 418 F.2d 159, 161 (CA 9 1969). Consequently, I would reverse the judgment below and remand with instructions to vacate the judgment of conviction.\n\nB\n\n58\nElkanich v. United States (collateral review). I agree, but for wholly different reasons, with the Court's view, expressed in n. 2 of its opinion, 401 U.S., at 650, 91 S.Ct., at 1151, that we need not evaluate the search of Elkanich's apartment in light of the precepts of Chimel. His conviction became final five years prior to Chimel's promulgation, and prevailing law at that time certainly validated the search here involved. See United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653 (1950), and Harris v. United States, 331 U.S. 145, 67 S.Ct. 1098, 91 L.Ed. 1399 (1947). An appraisal of the facts surrounding this search leads me quite easily to conclude that the procedures used in obtaining this conviction were not so fundamentally devoid of the necessary elements of procedural due process as to require upsetting this conviction in spite of the fact that it was perfectly lawful when made final. The agents here clearly had probable cause to arrest petitioner, were not undertaking a fishing expedition for any evidence they might findbut, rather, were looking for specific items that they had reason to believe might be concealed in various places around the premises and, indeed, generally limited their search to areas indicated by petitioner. I would affirm the judgment below.\n\nC\n\n59\nMackey v. United States (collateral review). Petitioner in this case seeks relief from confinement by way of habeas. At his trial for evading payment of income taxes, part of the Government's case in chief consisted of the introduction of 60 wagering excise tax returns. At the time his conviction became final in 1965, the introduction of these statements would have been permissible under the authority of United States v. Kahriger, 345 U.S. 22, 73 S.Ct. 510, 97 L.Ed. 754 (1953). I find it unnecessary to inquire whether it inevitably follows from the new rule enunciated in Marchetti and Grosso that such a procedure would today be held an unacceptable abridgment of petitioner's Fifth Amendment right to be free of compulsory self-incrimination. For, even assuming the latter cases, if applicable, would produce a different result, I cannot conclude that this change in the law would be sufficient to entitle petitioner to the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\n\n\n60\nMackey is not asserting that the conduct for which he is being punished, evading payment of his federal income taxes, has been held to be constitutionally immune from punishment. In this regard, Mackey's claim differs from that raised by the respondent in Coin & Currency, also decided today, where Marchetti and Grosso do operate to render Congress powerless to punish the conduct there at issue. Instead, Mackey's claim is that the procedures utilized in procuring his conviction were vitiated by the Marchetti and Grosso decisions. Since matters of procedure rather than substance are involved, see Part II of this opinion, I would apply to the resolution of this habeas petition the law in effect at the time Mackey's conviction became final, absent a showing that the procedures employed were fundamentally unfair. While Kahriger did indeed, in my judgment, rest upon an 'excessively narrow' view of the scope of the privilege against self-incrimination, I cannot say that hindsight reveals that judgment to have been so grossly erroneous as to amount to the perpetration of an inexcusable inequity against Mackey in these circumstances. Despite our rejection of it as a matter of Fifth Amendment policy, the prior justification of the Government's activity in this area\u2014that persons affected could avoid incrimination by ceasing to engage in illegal activities\u2014is not without some force.\n\n\n61\nAlthough the question is, for me, not free of difficulty, I would affirm the judgment below for the reasons stated above.\n\nV\n\n62\nIn conclusion, the Court in deciding these cases seems largely to have forgotten the limitations that accompany its functions as a court of law. For the retroactivity doctrine announced today bespeaks more considerations of policy than of legal principle. Treating direct and collateral review as if they were of one piece seems to me faulty analysis, ignoring, as it does, the jurisprudential considerations that differentiate the two kinds of adjudicatory functions. As a court of law we have no right on direct review to treat one case differently from another with respect to constitutional provisions applicable to both. As regards cases coming here on collateral review, the problem of retroactivity is in truth none other than one of resettling the limits of the reach of the Great Writ, which under the recent decisions of this Court has been given almost boundless sweep.9 Until the Court is prepared to do this I can see no really satisfactory solution to the retroactivity problem. Meanwhile, I very much regret to see the existing free-wheeling approach to that problem now rewritten into the jurisprudence of this Court.\n\n\n63\nI would affirm the judgments in Nos. 36 and 82 and reverse the judgment in No. 81 upon the premises discussed in this opinion.\n\n\n64\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL joins, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n65\nThree years ago we held that the federal wagering tax statutes, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4401 et seq., subjected those to whom they applied to such a real and substantial danger of self-incrimination that those statutes could 'not be employed to punish criminally those persons who have defended a failure to comply with their requirements with a proper assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination.' Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 42, 88 S.Ct. 697, 699, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906 (1968). This case present the question what, if any, use the Government is entitled to make of wagering excise tax returns, filed pursuant to the statutory scheme, in a prosecution for income tax evasion. Since I believe the Fifth Amendment does not prevent the use of such returns to show a likely source of unreported income in a criminal prosecution for income tax evasion, I concur in the judgment of the Court.1\n\n\n66\n* The relevant facts may be briefly stated. As required by statute, petitioner from 1956 through 1960 filed monthly wagering excise tax returns showing his name, address, and the gross amount of wagers accepted by him during the month in question.2 He was subsequently indicted for willfully attempting to evade payment of his income taxes for those years. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201. At trial, the Government used the wagering tax returns to show that the gross amount of wagers reported, less the expenses of petitioner's business as reported on his annual income tax returns, was greater than the profits from gambling reported on those same annual returns. The Court of Appeals affirmed over petitioner's claim that the returns were inflammatory, prejudicial, and irrelevant. 345 F.2d 499 (CA7 1965). After our decisions in Marchetti v. United States, supra, and Grosso v. United States, supra, petitioner filed an application for postconviction relief on the ground that use of the wagering tax returns was barred by the Fifth Amendment. The application was denied by the District Court in an unreported opinion, and the denial was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 411 F.2d 504 (CA7 1969).\n\nII\n\n67\nAt first glance, petitioner's argument appears compellingly simple. Since the information required of him under the federal wagering tax statutes presented a real and substantial danger of subjecting him to criminal prosecution for his gambling activities, the Government lacked the power to compel the information absent a waiver of his Fifth Amendment privilege unless it provided the necessary immunity from prosecution. Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906 (1968); Heike v. United States, 227 U.S. 131, 143\u2014144, 33 S.Ct. 226, 228, 57 L.Ed. 450 (1913); Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 584\u2014586, 12 S.Ct. 195, 206, 35 L.Ed. 1110 (1892). Since petitioner filed the wagering tax returns under threat of criminal prosecution for failure to do so, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, and since he never knowingly waived his Fifth Amendment privilege, see Grosso v. United States, supra, 390 U.S., at 70\u201471, 88 S.Ct., at 714\u2014715, he is entitled to the immunity required by the Fifth Amendment. Adams v. Maryland, 347 U.S. 179, 181, 74 S.Ct. 442, 444, 98 L.Ed.2d 608 (1954). Therefore, petitioner argues, the Government was foreclosed from using the information provided by him on the wagering tax returns against him in a criminal prosecution for evasion of the income tax.\n\n\n68\nBut in Marchetti and Grosso, we dealt with the question whether, in light of possible uses of testimonial evidence sought to be compelled over a claim of privilege, the Fifth Amendment allows the individual concerned to withhold the evidence without penalty. In the present case, however, we deal with the scope of immunity required when the privilege is claimed and the evidence is nevertheless compelled. This distinction, in my view critical, is overlooked by petitioner. Where testimony has been refused, adjudication of necessity must take place in something of a vacuum. Although an individual may not 'draw a conjurer's circle around the whole matter' by refusing to provide any explanation why the information sought might be incriminating, United States v. Sullivan, 274 U.S. 259, 264, 47 S.Ct. 607, 608, 71 L.Ed. 1037 (1927), he need not provide the incriminating evidence in order to demonstrate that the privilege was validly invoked, Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486, 71 S.Ct. 814, 818, 95 L.Ed. 1118 (1951). In such circumstance, sanctions may be applied for refusal to testify only if it is \"perfectly clear, from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case * * * that the answer(s) cannot possibly have (a) tendency' to incriminate.' Id., at 488, 71 S.Ct., at 819, quoting Temple v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. 892, 898 (1881) (emphasis in original).\n\n\n69\nBut where the individual has succumbed to compulsion and provided the information sought, finer analytical tools may be employed. 'A factual record showing, for example, the substance of the individual's compelled testimony, the way that testimony was subsequently used by the prosecutor, and the crime for which the individual was ultimately prosecuted, provides important considerations to anchor and inform the constitutional judgment.' Piccirillo v. New York, 400 U.S. 548, 558, 91 S.Ct. 520, 526, 27 L.Ed.2d 596 (1971) (Brennan, J., dissenting). Thus, even when the privilege against self-incrimination permits an individual to refuse to answer questions asked by the Government, if false answers are given the individual may be prosecuted for making false statements. United States v. Knox, 396 U.S. 77, 80\u201483, 90 S.Ct. 363, 365\u2014367, 24 L.Ed.2d 275 (1969).\n\n\n70\nThe flaw in petitioner's argument lies in its misunderstanding of Marchetti and Grosso as applied to a situation where testimonial evidence has been compelled over a claim of privilege. For we did not, in those cases, cast any doubt upon the power of the United States to impose taxes on unlawful, as well as on lawful activities. 390 U.S., at 44, 88 S.Ct., at 700, see United States v. Sullivan, 274 U.S., at 263, 47 S.Ct., at 607. Nor did we suggest that the Fifth Amendment would make it impossible for Congress to construct an enforceable statutory scheme for reporting by individuals of their illicit gains. See 390 U.S., at 72, 88 S.Ct., at 716 (Brennan, J., concurring). Rather, we noted that '(t)he laws of every State, except Nevada, include broad prohibitions against gambling, wagering, and associated activities,' and that even Nevada imposed 'criminal penalties upon lotteries and certain other wagering activities taxable under (the federal) statutes.' Id., at 44\u201446, 88 S.Ct., at 700, 701. We noted that federal statutes prohibit the use of the mails and of interstate commerce for many activities ancillary to wagering.3 Id., at 44, 88 S.Ct., at 700. On that basis we concluded that 'throughout the United States, wagering is 'an area permeated with criminal statutes,' and those engaged in wagering are a group 'inherently suspect of criminal activities.' Albertson v. SACB, 382 U.S. 70, 79, 86 S.Ct. 194, 199, 15 L.Ed.2d 165.' Marchetti, 390 U.S., at 47, 88 S.Ct. at 702. Accordingly, registration and payment of the occupational tax, or the filing of a wagering excise tax return that the Government required as a prerequisite to payment of the excise tax,4 would subject the individual concerned to \"real and appreciable,' and not merely 'imaginary and unsubstantial,' hazards of self-incrimination.' Id., at 48, 88 S.Ct., at 702; Grosso, 390 U.S., at 64\u201467, 88 S.Ct., at 711\u2014713. Since we found the 'required records' doctrine of Shapiro v. United States, 335 U.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 1375, 92 L.Ed. 1787 (1948), inapplicable to the statutory requirement that a gambler admit his present or future involvement in gambling activity, Marchetti, 391 U.S., at 55\u201457, 88 S.Ct., at 706\u2014707, Grosso, 390 U.S., at 67\u201469, 88 S.Ct., at 713\u2014714, we held that the privilege against self-incrimination was available to the petitioners as a defense to prosecution for failure to register for, report, or pay the federal wagering taxes.5\n\n\n71\nHad the present case arisen in the context of a federal investigation designed simply to uncover evidence of criminal activity, we would need to go no further.6 In such a situation, petitioner would be entitled to 'absolute immunity * * * from prosecution (under federal laws) for any transaction revealed in that testimony.' Piccirillo v. New York, 400 U.S., at 562, 91 S.Ct., at 527 (Brennan, J., dissenting); Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S., at 584\u2014586, 12 S.Ct., at 206. But although we recognized in Marchetti that 'Congress intended information obtained as a consequence of registration and payment of the (gambling) occupational tax to be provided to interested prosecuting authorities,' Marchetti, 390 U.S., at 58\u201459, 88 S.Ct., at 708, 19 L.Ed.2d 889,7 we nevertheless concluded that the 'United States' principal interest is evidently the collection of revenue, and not the punishment of gamblers.' Id., at 57, 88 S.Ct., at 707; see United States v. Calamaro, 354 U.S. 351, 358, 77 S.Ct. 1138, 1143, 1 L.Ed.2d 1394 (1957).\n\n\n72\nThis dual purpose is significant here. For while the Government may not undertake the prosecution of crime by inquiring of individuals what criminal acts they have lately planned or committed, it may surround a taxing or regulatory scheme with reporting requirements designed to insure compliance with the scheme. See Marchetti, 390 U.S., at 44, 60, 88 S.Ct., at 700, 708; Grosso, 390 U.S., at 72 74, 88 S.Ct., at 715\u2014717 (concurring opinion). In the latter situation, the privilege may not be claimed if the danger of incrimination is only that the information required may show a violation of the taxing or regulatory scheme. Thus in Shapiro v. United States, 335 U.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 1375, 92 L.Ed. 1787 (1948), we upheld a conviction based upon records of sales provided under compulsion of a regulation under the Emergency Price Control Act, 56 Stat. 23. The privilege had been claimed on the basis that the records would (as they did) provide evidence of a violation of the Act. We rejected the claim, reasoning that the Government has power to compel \"suitable information of transactions which are the appropriate subjects of governmental regulation, and the enforcement of restrictions validly established.\" Id., at 33, 68 S.Ct., at 1392.8 And in United States v. Sullivan, 274 U.S. 259, 47 S.Ct. 607, 71 L.Ed. 1037 (1927), we rejected a claim that the privilege against self-incrimination allowed an individual whose income was earned in crime to file no form of income tax return whatsoever. Although dubious, we noted the possibility that the privilege could be claimed to excuse reporting the amount of income earned because that alone would disclose the criminal activities that had produced the income. Id., at 263\u2014264, 47 S.Ct., at 607. But neither in Sullivan nor in any other of our cases is there the slightest suggestion that an individual may refuse to disclose the income he has earned solely because such disclosure will indicate a failure to pay the taxes imposed on that income.\n\n\n73\nOf Course, the Government may not insulate inquiries designed to produce incriminating information merely by labeling the inquiry a necessary incident of a regulatory scheme. Where the essence of a statutory scheme is to forbid a given class of activities, it may not be enforced by requiring individuals to report their violations. See Marchetti, supra; Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 88 S.Ct. 722, 19 L.Ed.2d 923 (1968); Albertson v. SACB, 382 U.S. 70, 86 S.Ct. 194, 15 L.Ed.2d 165 (1965). But where the statutory scheme is not designed to forbid certain acts, but only to require that they be done in a certain way, the Government may enforce its requirements by a compulsory scheme of reporting, directed at all who engage in those activities, and not on its face designed simply to elicit incriminating information. Shapiro v. United States, supra; see Albertson v. SACB, supra, 382 U.S., at 77\u201480, 86 S.Ct., at 198 199.\n\n\n74\nViewed in this light, then, Marchetti and Grosso are the outgrowth of two principles inapplicable to the problem at hand. The first is that when a given class of activities is, in the main, made criminal by either state or federal law, an individual may not be compelled to disclose whether he engages in activities within the class unless his disclosure is compensated by the requisite grant of immunity.9 Marchetti, supra; Haynes v. United States, supra; Albertson v. SACB, supra. The second is that such individuals may likewise not be compelled, absent sufficient immunity, to disclose the details of their activities within such a suspect class: for if the mere admission of engaging in any of a class of activities is sufficiently likely to lead to criminal prosecution that the privilege against self-incrimination may be invoked, admission of the details of these activities is a fortiori likely to lead to incrimination. Grosso, supra.\n\n\n75\nNeither of these principles, however, controls the case at hand. The relevant class of activities 'permeated with criminal statutes,' Albertson v. SACB, 382 U.S., at 79, 86 S.Ct., at 199, is the class of activities related to gambling. But this case does not involve a prosecution for gambling or related activities. It involves a prosecution for income tax evasion, by use of information compelled pursuant to a scheme requiring all those who engage in the business of accepting wagers10 to report their income twice. For the reasons discussed above, the Government may validly enforce the tax laws by a scheme of required reports, directed at all persons engaging in certain types of activity, and requiring them to report the amount of their income so that the Government may insure that the requisite taxes have been paid. If such a reporting requirement raises a substantial danger of incrimination under state or federal statutes making criminal the activity that is being taxed, an individual may, of course, assert the privilege against self-incrimination and refuse to disclose the information sought. We so held in Marchetti and Grosso. And if the information has been compelled over a claim of privilege, application of those cases requires that the individual be protected against the use of that information in state prosecutions under the statutes making criminal the taxed activity, and to complete immunity from prosecution under federal statutes of like kind. Piccirillo v. New York, 400 U.S., at 561 574, 91 S.Ct., at 527\u2014533 (Brennan, J., dissenting); Adams v. Maryland, 347 U.S., at 181, 74 S.Ct., at 444, 98 L.Ed. 608; Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S., at 584\u2014586, 12 S.Ct., at 206; cf. Murphy v. Waterfront Comm., 378 U.S. 52, 79, and n. 18, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 1609, 12 L.Ed.2d 678 (1964). He is, in short, entitled to the protection required by the Fifth Amendment. But here the Government was entitled to demand the information that petitioner supplied\u2014his gross income from wagering\u2014in order to enforce the tax laws. Petitioner was entitled to claim the privilege only because of the possibility of prosecution under state or federal gambling laws. No such prosecution is involved here. 'Once the reason for the privilege ceases, the privilege ceases.' Ullmann v. United States, 350 U.S. 422, 439, 76 S.Ct. 497, 507, 100 L.Ed. 511 (1956). Since the United States was entitled to demand the information at issue here for the purpose to which it was eventually put, the danger that petitioner's disclosures might also have been impermissibly used does not prevent their present, legitimate use even though the danger of impermissible use would justify refusal to provide the information at all.11\n\nIII\n\n76\nFinally, our decisions in both Marchetti and Grosso not to attempt to salvage the statutory scheme by imposing use restrictions do not require that, once evidence has actually been compelled, we refuse to protect a valid governmental interest by restricting use of that evidence any more than is required by the Fifth Amendment. For although we recognized in Marchetti that 'the imposition of use-restrictions would directly preclude effectuation of a significant element of Congress' purposes in adopting the wagering taxes,' 390 U.S., at 59, 88 S.Ct., at 708, the primary basis for our refusal to impose such restrictions was that 'the imposition of such restrictions would necessarily oblige state prosecuting authorities to establish in each case that their evidence was untainted by any connection with information obtained as a consequence of the wagering taxes; the federal requirements would thus be protected, only at the cost of hampering, perhaps seriously, enforcement of state prohibitions against gambling.' Ibid.12 Since a balance between effective state enforcement of gambling laws and the interests of the federal treasury was one to be struck by Congress, and not this Court, we declined to impose the proposed restrictions. Id., at 59\u201460, 88 S.Ct., at 708. And in Gross, we merely noted that it would be 'inappropriate to impose such restrictions upon one portion of a statutory system, when we have concluded that it would be improper, for reasons discussed in Marchetti, to do so upon 'an integral part' of the same system.' 390 U.S., at 69, 88 S.Ct., at 714. Once again, however, different considerations apply when the question is not whether information may be compelled but rather to what uses compelled information may be put. Once the return has been filed, prosecution under state gambling laws can take place only if the State can demonstrate that its evidence is not tainted by information derived from the incriminatory aspects of the return. Since disclosure once made may never be completely undone, this burden must be borne by the State regardless of what additional restrictions are imposed upon use of the return. Accordingly, the considerations that led us to decline the imposition of use restrictions for the future in Marchetti and Grosso are not compelling in situations where the incriminating information has already been disclosed. Petitioner is therefore entitled to the immunity required by the Fifth Amendment, and to no more. Since I believe the Amendment is no bar to the use to which his wagering tax returns were put, I concur in the judgment of the Court.\n\n\n77\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK concurs, dissenting.\n\n\n78\nI had assumed that all criminal and civil decisions involving constitutional defenses which go in favor of the defendant were necessarily retroactive. That is to say, the Constitution has from Chief Justice Jay's time been retroactive,* for there were no decisions on the points prior thereto. Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 and Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906, exonerated defendants who, when they failed to file returns, were not by reason of United States v. Kahriger, 345 U.S. 22, 73 S.Ct. 510, 97 L.Ed. 754, entitled to a constitutional immunity. Why Marchetti and Grosso are entitled to relief and Mackey is not, is a mystery. It is said that Mackey's gambling return, 'like physical evidence seized in violation of a new interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, is concededly relevant and probative even though obtained by the Government through means since defined by this Court as constitutionally objectionable.' The same could be said of Marchetti and Crosso. Yet their convictions were reversed.\n\n\n79\nI could understand today's decision if Marchetti and Grosso had announced only a prospective rule applicable to all like defendants. But when the defendants in those cases are given the benefit of a new constitutional rule forged by the Court, it is not comprehensible, if justice rather than the fortuitous circumstances of the time of the trial is the standard, why all victims of the old unconstitutional rule should not be treated equally.\n\n\n80\nI can find nothing in the Constitution that authorizes some constitutional rules to be prospective and others to be retroactive. The majority often says the test is whether a new rule affects the integrity of the factfinding process, Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 22 L.Ed.2d 248. Yet even that test is not applied when the majority thinks that the impact of the new rule, if applied with due regard to the Equal Protection Clause, would be 'devastating.' Tehan v. Shott, 382 U.S. 406, 419, 86 S.Ct. 459, 467, 15 L.Ed.2d 453. The Constitution grants this Court no such legislative powers.\n\n\n81\nMy views have been expressed in Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 640, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 1743, 14 L.Ed.2d 601, and Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 736, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 1783, 16 L.Ed.2d 882, and I adhere to them. I would continue to construe all constitutional safeguards 'strictly.'\n\n\n\n1\n Petitioner received a sentence of five years' imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 on each count, the prison terms to be served concurrently.\n\n\n2\n This method of prosecution is discussed and approved in Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954); Friedberg v. United States, 348 U.S. 142, 75 S.Ct. 138, 99 L.Ed. 188 (1954); Smith v. United States, 348 U.S. 147, 75 S.Ct. 194, 99 L.Ed. 192 (1954); United States v. Calderon, 348 U.S. 160, 75 S.Ct. 186, 99 L.Ed. 202 (1954).\n\n\n3\n In rejecting petitioner's application for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the District Judge so read the Court of Appeals' earlier opinion. See App. 28.\n\n\n4\n The District Court advanced several reasons for denying petitioner's application. See App. 27\u201438. Noting that with gambling excise tax returns 'there is little danger of their unreliability other than their possible understatement of liability,' id., at 32, the District Judge held that Marchetti and Grosso should not be applied to petitioner's case:\n'An examination of these and other cases reveals no instance where the (Supreme) Court has given retroactive application to an exclusionary rule or other Constitutional guarantee where the reliability of the fact-finding process had not been jeopardized. The briefs for (Mackey) have suggested none. In (petitioner) Mackey's trial, the introduction of the wagering tax forms did not jeopardize the integrity of the trial except to the extent that they showed that he was engaged in illegal activities other than that charged. This possibility was raised by Mackey's attorneys at the trial, and apparently on appeal, and both times the Courts held that there was no error.' Id., at 36.\nWe note in reference to the last point mentioned by the District Judge that at trial, the court's charge to the jury included several strong admonitions to the effect that the question of whether any business run by petitioner was legal or illegal was irrelevant to the offense charged in the indictment failure to report income for five years. See Brief for the United States 11.\n\n\n5\n Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965).\n\n\n6\n Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969).\n\n\n7\n Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).\n\n\n8\n See n. 4, supra.\n\n\n2\n For example, we have more than once in recent years had before us a libel case in which a party was allegedly libeled and brought suit for redress prior to this Court's decision in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), where we announced a new constitutional rule governing liability in libel suits brought by public officials. Yet no one connected with such cases has ever been heard to do so much as hint that the New York Times rule is not applicable because the conduct complained of occurred or the suit was brought before this new rule was promulgated. See, e.g., Rosenblatt v. Baer, 383 U.S. 75, 86 S.Ct. 669, 15 L.Ed.2d 597 (1966). Cf. Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, 393 U.S. 268, 281\u2014283, 89 S.Ct. 518, 525\u2014527, 21 L.Ed.2d 474 (1969).\nConversely, is it not perfectly clear that, had such a party procured and collected a final damage award prior to New York Times the defendant could not have urged that the case be reopened solely because of our subsequent decision in that case? Absent proof of fraud or want of jurisdiction in the trial court that judgment would be res judicata and entitled to full faith and credit throughout the land.\nThis is not to suggest that civil and criminal collateral attack ought necessarily to be precisely congruent in the federal system. But certainly it illustrates that the law has always perceived collateral attack as a problem quite different from direct appeal.\n\n\n3\n Professor Mishkin has pointed out that 'prior to Linkletter, the criteria applied in federal habeas corpus proceedings were uniformly the constitutional standards in effect at the time of those proceedings, regardless of when the conviction was actually entered.' Mishkin, The Supreme Court 1964 Term\u2014Foreword: The High Court, the Great Writ, and the Due Process of Time and Law, 79 Harv.L.Rev. 56, 79 (1965). See also, e.g., Note, Developments in the Law\u2014Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1040, 1151, 1153 (1970); Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 17, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 1078, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963); Miller v. Gladden, 341 F.2d 972, 975 (CA9 1965).\nFor a counter-example, see Milton v. Wainwright, 306 F.Supp. 929 (SD Fla.1969), where a district judge adjudicating a habeas petition declined to consider any of this Court's decisions relating to involuntary confessions that post-dated 1958, the time at which the petitioner's murder conviction became final. See also n. 4, infra.\n\n\n4\n Arguably, Reck v. Pate, 367 U.S. 433, 81 S.Ct. 1541, 6 L.Ed.2d 948 (1961), tacitly holds that habeas petitions must be judged in accordance with current law. The Court there directed the issuance of the writ on the ground that petitioner's conviction, which became final in 1936, had been procured by the introduction into evidence of an illegally obtained confession, relying heavily on cases decided by this Court subsequent to 1936. The District Court, in denying relief, had clearly held that the admissibility of his confession was to be judged by standards prevailing in 1936. United States ex rel. Reck v. Ragen, 172 F.Supp. 734, 745\u2014746 (ND Ill.1959). However, this choice of law problem was not expressly adverted to and the case arose before this Court produced the recent enlargement of new constitutional rules of criminal procedure.\n\n\n5\n In 1966, Congress amended the habeas statutes to deal with this Court's discussion in Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963), of res judicata principles as they apply to habeas corpus. One subsection of that new statute provides:\n'In a habeas corpus proceeding brought in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a prior judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States on an appeal or review * * * of the decision of such State court, shall be conclusive as to all issues of fact or law * * * actually adjudicated by the Supreme Court therein, unless the applicant * * * shall plead and the court shall find the existence of a material and controlling\nfact which did not appear in the record of the proceeding in the Supreme Court (and could not have been put in by exercising due diligence).' 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(c) (1964 ed., Supp. V) (emphasis added).\nUnless one is to read 'fact' as including a change in the law, it would seem that Congress has provided in these circumstances for finality as to legal determinations. That 'fact' is properly read narrowly seems the better view in light of subsections (a) and (b) which permit a subsequent habeas petition (where there was no Supreme Court review) if it presents a 'new ground' or 'a factual or other ground not adjudicated on the (prior) hearing.' Although the legislative history is extremely sparse, it fully supports this reading. Both the House and Senate committee reports accompanying these amendments stated that the purpose of the reformulation of \u00a7 2244 was to introduce a greater measure of finality into the law by providing for a qualified application of the res judicata concept. See H.R.Rep.No.1892, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 3, 8 (1966); S.Rep.No.1797, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1966); U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, p. 3663. There was no relevant floor debate on these amendments.\nNor do I think the converse inference can properly be drawn that, if Congress provided legal finality for those prisoners whose convictions had been affirmed by us, it intentionally determined that other convicts should be able to avail themselves of all new constitutional rules on habeas. The language of subsections (a) and (b) certainly does not compel such a conclusion. The congressional committee reports neither state nor fairly imply that these amendments were designed to achieve the maximum feasible or desirable finality in habeas proceedings. Most important, it is difficult to imagine what would be the rationale for such a distinction merely between those who have and have not, at some time in the remote past, had full review of their cases in this Court.\n\n\n6\n I have in mind, of course, decisions such as Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963); Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966); Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969).\n\n\n7\n For example, Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576, 89 S.Ct. 1354, 22 L.Ed.2d 572 (1969); Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 89 S.Ct. 1243, 22 L.Ed.2d 542 (1969); Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967). Some rules may have both procedural and substantive ramifications, as I have used those terms here. See, e.g., my discussion, in Part IV-C of this opinion of the divergent ways Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), and Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906 (1968), bear on the problems raised by today's Fifth Amendment cases.\n\n\n8\n See, e.g., Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 25 L.Ed. 717 (1880); Crowley v. Christensen, 137 U.S. 86, 11 S.Ct. 13, 34 L.Ed. 620 (1890); Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886). And see cases collected in Amsterdam, Search, Seizure, and Section 2255: A Comment, 112 U.Pa.L.Rev. 378, 384 n. 30 (1964), and the discussion therein of the finality implications such instances present.\n\n\n9\n For example, though correct in its result, I am now of the view that Linkletter would have been better decided had it simply held that federal habeas corpus does not lie for claimed errors in the introduction of illegally seized evidence.\n\n\n1\n This view of the case makes it unnecessary for me to decide whether petitioner's conviction should be examined without regard to the standards embodied in Marchetti and Grosso. The balance of this opinion is written on the assumption that Marchetti and Grosso are applicable.\n\n\n2\n See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6011(a); Treas.Reg. \u00a7 44.6011(a)\u20141(a), 26 CFR \u00a7 44.6011(a)\u20141(a).\n\n\n3\n See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084 (interstate transmission of wagering information), \u00a7\u00a7 1301\u20141304 (conduct of lotteries by mails or broadcasting), \u00a7 1952 (interstate travel in aid of, inter alia, gambling), \u00a7 1953 (interstate transportation of wagering paraphernalia).\n\n\n4\n We were informed by the United States in Grosso that the wagering excise tax would not be accepted unless accompanied by the required return. 390 U.S., at 65, 88 S.Ct., at 712.\n\n\n5\n In addition, we declined in both Marchetti and Grosso the Government's invitation to salvage the statutory scheme by imposing use restrictions on the information required. Marchetti, 390 U.S., at 58\u201460, 88 S.Ct., at 707\u2014708; Grosso, 390 U.S., at 69, 88 S.Ct., at 714. The relevance of this to the issue before us is discussed infra, at 711\u2014713. For the moment it is sufficient to note that even the imposition of use restrictions could not have saved the convictions at issue in those cases, for the petitioners obviously had no way of knowing, when they failed to register and file the required forms, that use restrictions might be imposed. See Murphy v. Waterfront Comm., 378 U.S. 52, 79\u201480, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 1609\u20141610, 12 L.Ed.2d 678 (1964); Reina v. United States, 364 U.S. 507, 514\u2014515, 71 S.Ct. 260, 264\u2014265, 5 L.Ed.2d 249 (1960).\n\n\n6\n See n. 1, supra.\n\n\n7\n In Grosso, we remarked that 'although there is no statutory instruction, as there is for the occupational tax, that state and local prosecuting officers be provided listings of those who have paid the excise tax, neither has Congress imposed explicit restrictions upon the use of information obtained as a consequence of payment of the tax,' and that the Revenue Service in fact disseminated such information to 'interested prosecuting authorities.' Grosso, 390 U.S., at 66, 88 S.Ct., at 712.\n\n\n8\n The regulation upheld in Shapiro required only the keeping of records, and not their reporting; the information there was compelled pursuant to an administrative subpoena. But as we noted in Marchetti, this situation is constitutionally indistinguishable from a simple reporting requirement. 390 U.S., at 56 n. 14, 88 S.Ct., at 706.\n\n\n9\n Since the statutory scheme in Marchetti and Grosso provided no immunity whatsoever, and since those cases arose in the context of an attempt by the Government to punish individuals for failure to disclose the information requested, we had no occasion there to determine the precise scope of the immunity that would be required to displace the privilege.\n\n\n10\n The few exceptions to this requirement are noted in Marchetti, 390 U.S., at 42, 88 S.Ct., at 699.\n\n\n11\n The filing of a wagering tax return (or registration as a prospective gambler) necessarily involves an admission that one has engaged in, or intends to engage in gambling. Since gambling and related activities are very likely to be criminal under state or federal law, the Government lacks power to compel such an admission absent the requisite grant of immunity. This was the question involved in Marchetti and Grosso. But what is relevant to the present case is not whether petitioner was involved in criminal activity, but whether he paid the taxes imposed on his income. I have indicated above why I believe that the Government may enforce an otherwise unobjectionable scheme designed to insure that individuals report the amount of their income in order to enforce the tax laws. It therefore follows that the registration and reporting requirements of the federal wagering tax statutes could properly be enforced under a statute granting those who complied with the requirements immunity from prosecution under federal statutes that outlaw gambling and related activities, and protection against the use of information contained in the returns in aid of prosecution under state or federal laws making such activities criminal.\n\n\n12\n That this was the primary basis for our refusal is evidenced by our recognition that the 'United States' principal interest is evidently the collection of revenue and not the punishment of gamblers.' 390 U.S., at 57, 88 S.Ct., at 707. Absent the necessity for balancing state and federal interests, we would surely not have crippled the primary purpose of the statutes because a secondary purpose was necessarily disabled.\n\n\n*\n See Chisholm v.

{"text":"352 U.S. 599\n77 S.Ct. 545\n1 L.Ed.2d 583\nLuis Alvara CEBALLOS (y Arboleda), Petitioner,v.Edward J. SHAUGHNESSY, District Director of the  Immigration and Naturalization Service at the  Port of New York.\nNo. 71.\nArgued Jan. 16 and 17, 1957.\nDecided March 11, 1957.\n\nMr. Sidney Kansas, New York City, for the petitioner.\nMr. Oscar H. Davis, Washington, D.C., for the respondent.\nMr. Justice BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis declaratory judgment action was brought by petitioner, in March 1955 in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, to obtain a judgment against the District Director of Immigration declaring that petitioner was eligible for suspension of deportation and restraining the Director from taking him into custody for deportation.1 The District Court dismissed the complaint, without reaching the merits, upon the procedural ground 'that the Attorney General (of the United States) and\/or the Commissioner (of Immigration) are indispensable parties to the instant action.'2 The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, not only for the reason given by the District Court, but also upon the ground that, because the petitioner is 'an alien who 'has made application' to be relieved from military service,' he is debarred from citizenship as a matter of law and 'hence is not eligible for an order suspending deportation.'3 This Court granted certiorari.4\n\n\n2\nDeportation proceedings had been instituted because petitioner had entered the United States on April 2, 1951, on a temporary visa and remained beyond the period for which he was admitted. Petitioner was found deportable but was given permission to depart voluntarily, in lieu of deportation. Petitioner's timely application for suspension of deportation under \u00a7 19(c) of the Immigration Act of 1917, as amended,5 was denied by the Immigration and Naturalization Service because it found that petitioner did not satisfy a prerequisite for the application of that section\u2014eligibility for naturalization. His ineligibility was based on a finding that in August 1943 petitioner, as a citizen and subject of Colombia, then a World War II neutral, applied under \u00a7 3(a) of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended, for relief from service with the United States armed forces. Section 3(a) provided that 'any person who makes such application shall thereafter be debarred from becoming a citizen of the United States.'6\n\n\n3\nThe petitioner was admitted to the United States for permanent residence in February 1942, during World War II. On June 16, 1943, he executed Selective Service System Form DSS 304, 'Alien's Personal History and Statement,' which gave the alien a choice of inserting 'do' or 'do not' in the statement: 'I * * * object to service in the land or naval forces of the United States.' The petitioner inserted the word 'do.' The form contained this notice:\n\n\n4\n'* * * If you are a citizen or subject of a neutral country,      and you do not wish to serve in the land or naval forces of      the United States, you may apply to your local board for      Application by Alien for Relief from Military Service (Form      301) which, when executed by you and filed with the local      board, will relieve you from the obligation to serve in the      land or naval forces of the United States, but will also      debar you from thereafter becoming a citizen of the United      States.'7\n\n\n5\nOn August 26, 1943, the petitioner executed Form DSS 301, 'Application by Alien for Relief from Military Service.' The form contained the following paragraph:\n\n\n6\n'I do hereby make application to be relieved from liability      for training and service in the land or naval forces of the      United States, under the Selective Training and Service Act      of 1940, as amended, in accordance with the act of Congress,      approved December 20, 1941. I understand that the making of      this application to be relieved from such liability will debar me from becoming a citizen of the United States. *      * *'8\n\n\n7\nSelective Service Regulations required the local board to follow prescribed formalities to place a neutral applying for relief from service in Class IV\u2014C and to notify the alien of the classification.9 The board did not comply with these regulations in petitioner's case. Its first formal action was taken after the Selective Service System notified the board, on December 20, 1943, that Colombia, on November 26, 1943, had changed its neutral status to that of a cobelligerent with the United States. On January 27, 1944, five months after the petitioner filed the Form DSS 301, the board notified the petitioner that he was classified I\u2014A, available for military service, and ordered him to report for preinduction physical examination. He reported as ordered, but failed to pass the physical examination and, on March 2, 1944, was reclassified IV\u2014F, physically defective.\n\n\n8\nThe petitioner argues that neither the Attorney General nor the Commissioner of Immigration is a necessary party to this action. The respondent offers no argument in opposition. We hold that neither the Attorney General nor the Commissioner is a necessary party. This Court in Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U.S. 48, 75 S.Ct. 591, 99 L.Ed. 868, held that determination of the question of indispensability of parties is dependent, not on the nature of the decision attacked, but on the ability and authority of the defendant before the court to effectuate the relief which the alien seeks. In this case the petitioner asks to have the order of deportation suspended and to restrain the District Director from deporting him. Because the District Director is the official who would execute the deportation, he is a sufficient party. It is not a basis for distinction of Pedreiro that suspension of deportation, rather than deportation itself, is involved in this action.10\n\n\n9\nThe petitioner's argument on the merits challenges the holding of the Court of Appeals that the execution and filing of Form DSS 301 had the effect as a matter of law of debarring him from becoming a citizen of the United States. He contends that debarment could result only if the local board affirmatively granted the relief applied for by classifying him IV\u2014C on its records and giving him notice of its action. We hold that the petitioner's voluntary act of executing and filing, and allowing to remain on file, the legally sufficient application Form DSS 301 effected his debarment from citizenship under \u00a7 3(a).11 The explicit terms of the section debar the neutral alien 'who makes such application' for immunity from military service.\n\n\n10\nLegislative history shows this to be the effect contemplated by Congress.12 This same construction has been adopted in the few court decisions which refer to the section,13and administrative construction has consistently given the section this meaning.14 The neutral alien in this country during the war was at liberty to refuse to bear arms to help us win the struggle, but the price he paid for his unwillingness was permanent debarment from United States citizenship.\n\n\n11\nThe petitioner argues that in any event \u00a7 315 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952,15 and not s 3(a) of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, governs this case. Section 315 of the 1952 Act enacts a two-pronged requirement for the determination of permanent ineligibility for citizenship: the alien must be one 'who applies or has applied for exemption,' and also one who 'is or was relieved or discharged from such training or service on such ground.' That section has no application here. The 1952 law had not been enacted when the petitioner applied for relief from deportation in 195116 and by its terms is expressly made inapplicable to proceedings for suspension of deportation under \u00a7 19 of the Immigration Act of 1917 pending, as here, on the effective date of the 1952 law.17\n\n\n12\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n1\n The action was instituted pursuant to \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 60 Stat. 243, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1009, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009, and the general jurisdictional provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 230, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1329, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1329.\n\n\n2\n 130 F.Supp. 30, 31.\n\n\n3\n 229 F.2d 592, 593.\n\n\n4\n 351 U.S. 981, 76 S.Ct. 1047, 100 L.Ed. 1495.\n\n\n5\n Section 19(c) of the Immigration Act of 1917, as amended, provided in pertinent part:\n'In the case of any alien * * * who is deportable under any law of the United States and who has proved good moral character for the preceding five years, the Attorney General may (1) permit such alien to depart the United States to any country of his choice at his own expense, in lieu of deportation; or (2) suspend deportation of such alien if he is not ineligible for naturalization * * * if he finds (a) that such deportation would result in serious economic detriment to a citizen * * * who is the spouse * * * or minor child of such deportable alien * * *.' 39 Stat. 889, as amended, 54 Stat. 671, 62 Stat. 1206, 8 U.S.C.

Shaughnessy, 2 Cir., 208 F.2d 70, controlled. 229 F.2d at page 593.\n\n\n11\n The petitioner's claim that he executed the application in the belief that he was required to do so to obtain assignment to a Latin American contingent of the United States Army was rejected, after hearing, by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In fact, the Board of Immigration Appeals found that petitioner 'fully understood the legal consequences of his action and that he was not duly influenced by other considerations.' Cf. Moser v. United States, 341 U.S. 41, 71 S.Ct. 553, 95 L.Ed. 729.\n\n\n12\n This appears in both the House and Senate Reports. The House Report states:\n'* * * In the case of citizens or subjects of any neutral country, special provision is made to enable them, upon application, to be relieved from the liability for service, but the making of such application will debar them from becoming citizens of the United States. * * *' (Emphasis added.)

Belcher, Washington, D.C., for the respondent.\nMr. Chief Justice WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nTried and convicted in a Federal District Court for an offense against the United States, petitioner applied for leave to appeal his conviction to the Court of Appeals in forma pauperis. His application was denied. The case presents this question: What standard is to be applied by the lower federal courts in passing upon such applications? The articulation of a usable standard has been the source of considerable recent litigation.1 And, while we recognize that no single word or group of words can provide a precise formula that will dispose of every case, we think it appropriate to indicate in somewhat greater detail than in the past, the approach a Court of Appeals must take toward an indigent's application for leave to take a direct appeal from his criminal conviction in forma pauperis.\n\n\n2\nStatutory provision for litigation in forma pauperis in the federal courts is made by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915, authorizing '(a)ny court of the United States' to allow indigent persons to prosecute, defend or appeal suits without prepayment of costs. Before discussing our understanding of the proper manner in which a Court of Appeals is to exercise its authority to allow a criminal appeal in forma pauperis, we believe it would be helpful to indicate briefly the law applicable to criminal appeals generally. The provisions of \u00a7 1915 can be understood and applied in such cases only when read together with the other provisions of the Judicial Code and the Federal Rules governing criminal appeals.\n\n\n3\nPresent federal law has made an appeal from a District Court's judgment of conviction in a criminal case what is, in effect, a matter of right.2 That is, a defendant has a right to have his conviction reviewed by a Court of Appeals, and need not petition that court for an exercise of its discretion to allow him to bring the case before the court. The only requirements a defendant must meet for perfecting his appeal are those expressed as time limitations within which various procedural steps must be completed. First, a timely notice of appeal must be filed in the District Court to confer jurisdiction upon the Court of Appeals over the case.3 Subsequently, designations of the transcript, a record on appeal and briefs must be filed in the appropriate forum.4\n\n\n4\nThe indigent defendant will generally experience no material difficulty in filing a timely notice of appeal.5 But thereafter he is immediately faced with court fees for docketing his appeal in the Court of Appeals and with the cost of preparing the record, including a stenographic transcript of at least portions of the trial proceedings.6 If he is unable to meet either or both of these expenses, he can perfect his appeal only by applying for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. The application, to be made to the District Court in which the defendant was convicted,7 must conform to the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915(a) and include, in affidavit form, the defendant's representations of poverty, a statement of the case, and his belief that he is entitled to redress. The sole statutory language by which the District Court is guided in passing upon the application provides '(a)n appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis if the trial court certifies in writing that it is not taken in good faith.' 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915(a).\n\n\n5\nWhat meaning should be placed on the 'good faith' of which the statute speaks? In the context of a criminal appeal, we do not believe it can be read to require a District Court to determine whether the would-be appellant seeks further review of his case in subjective good faith, i.e., good faith from his subjective point of view.8 Such a construction would deprive the legislation of sensible meaning, there probably being no convicted defendant who would not sincerely wish a Court of Appeals to review his conviction. Further, a subjective standard might suggest that only persons who, in good conscience, could insist on their innocence, are to be entitled to a review of their convictions without payment of costs. We believe this interpretation of the statute is not required by reason nor is it consistent with the sound administration of criminal justice in the federal courts. We hold, instead, that 'good faith' in this context must be judged by an objective standard. We consider a defendant's good faith in this type of case demonstrated when he seeks appellate review of any issue not frivolous. In so doing, we note that if in forma pauperis litigation is attempted for reasons that may genuinely be characterized as the litigant's 'bad faith,' express authority exists in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915(d) for dismissal of the cause as frivolous.9\n\n\n6\nIf the District Court finds the application is not in good faith, and therefore denies leave to appeal in forma pauperis, the defendant may seek identical relief from the Court of Appeals.10 In considering such an application addressed to it, the Court of Appeals will have before it what is usually the pro se pleading of a layman and the certificate of a district judge that the applicant lacks 'good faith' in seeking appellate review. The District Court's certificate is not conclusive, although it is, of course, entitled to weight.11 However, we have recognized that the materials before the Court of Appeals at this stage of the proceedings are generally inadequate for passing upon the defendant's application. Nevertheless, if from the face of the papers he has filed, it is apparent that the applicant will present issues for review not clearly frivolous, the Court of Appeals should then grant leave to appeal in forma pauperis, appoint counsel to represent the appellant and proceed to consideration of the appeal on the merits in the same manner that it considers paid appeals. If, on the other hand, the claims made or the issues sought to be raised by the applicant are such that their substance cannot adequately be ascertained from the face of the defendant's application, the Court of Appeals must provide the would-be appellant with both the assistance of counsel and a record of sufficient completeness to enable him to attempt to make a showing that the District Court's certificate of lack of 'good faith' is in error and that leave to proceed with the appeal in forma pauperis should be allowed.12 If, with such aid, the applicant then presents any issue for the court's consideration not clearly frivolous, leave to proceed in forma pauperis must be allowed.\n\n\n7\nIn so holding we have been impelled by considerations beyond the corners of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915, considerations that it is our duty to assure to the greatest degree possible, within the statutory framework for appeals created by Congress, equal treatment for every litigant before the bar.13 We have expressed this view in a case comparable to the one before us here by holding that\n\n\n8\n'(u)nless the issues raised (by the indigent seeking leave to      appeal in forma pauperis) are so frivolous that the appeal      would be dismissed in the case of a nonindigent litigant,      Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. 39(a), 18 U.S.C.A., the request of an      indigent for leave to appeal in forma pauperis must be      allowed.' Ellis v. United States, 356 U.S. 674, 675, 78 S.Ct.      974, 975, 2 L.Ed.2d 1060.\n\n\n9\nThe point of equating the test for allowing a pauper's appeal to the test for dismissing paid cases, is to assure equality of consideration for all litigants. The equation is intended to place the burdens of proof and persuasion in all cases on the same party in these cases, on the Government. Since our statutes and rules make an appeal in a criminal case a matter of right, the burden of showing that that right has been abused through the prosecution of frivolous litigation should, at all times, be on the party making the suggestion of frivolity. It is not the burden of the petitioner to show that his appeal has merit, in the sense that he is bound, or even likely, to prevail ultimately. He is to be heard, as is any appellant in a criminal case, if he makes a rational argument on the law or facts. It is the burden of the Government, in opposing an attempted criminal appeal in forma pauperis, to show that the appeal is lacking in merit, indeed, that it is so lacking in merit that the court would dismiss the case on motion of the Government, had the case been docketed and a record been filed by an appellant able to afford the expense of complying with those requirements.14 If it were the practice of a Court of Appeals to screen the paid appeals on its docket for frivolity, without hearing oral argument, reviewing a record of the trial proceedings or considering full briefs, paupers could, of course, be bound by the same rules. But, if the practice of the Court of Appeals is to defer rulings on motions to dismiss paid appeals until the court has had the benefit of hearing argument and considering briefs and an adequate record, we hold it must no less accord the poor person the same procedural rights.\n\n\n10\nTwo additional factors have relevance to our view of the proper disposition of motions for leave to perfect criminal appeals in forma pauperis. These factors are the foundation for Rule 39(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, specifying that preference shall be given by the Courts of Appeals to criminal cases. This Rule, first, acknowledges the importance to the sovereign, to the accused and to society of a criminal prosecution. When society acts to deprive one of its members of his life, liberty or property, it takes its most awesome steps. No general respect for, nor adherence to, the law as a whole can well be expected without judicial recognition of the paramount need for prompt, eminently fair and sober criminal law procedures. The methods we employ in the enforcement of our criminal law have aptly been called the measures by which the quality of our civilization may be judged.15 Second, the preference to be accorded criminal appeals recognizes the need for speedy disposition of such cases. Delay in the final judgment of conviction, including its appellate review, unquestionably erodes the efficacy of law enforcement.\n\n\n11\nBoth of these considerations are particularly pertinent to criminal appeals in forma pauperis. Statistics compiled in the court below illustrate the undeniable fact that as many meritorious criminal cases come before that court through applications for leave to proceed in forma pauperis as on the paid docket, and that no a priori justification can be found for considering them, as a class, to be more frivolous than those in which costs have been paid.16 Even-handed administration of the criminal law demands that these cases be given no less consideration than others on the courts' dockets. Particularly since litigants in forma pauperis may, in the trial court, have suffered disadvantages in the defense of their cases inherent in their impecunious condition, is appellate review of their cases any less searching than that accorded paid appeals inappropriate. Indigents' appeals from criminal convictions cannot be used as a convenient valve for reducing the pressures of work on the courts. If there are those who insist on pursuing frivolous litigation, the courts are not powerless to dismiss or otherwise discourage it. But if frivolous litigation exists, we are not persuaded that it is concentrated in this narrow, yet vital, area of judicial duty.\n\n\n12\nSimilarly, statistics demonstrate the inevitable delay that surrounds a procedure in which the courts give piecemeal attention to the series of motions that indigents must make before a final adjudication of the merits of their cases is reached. Delays described in years between trial and final decision in criminal cases are the unhappy result of separate considerations of motions for the appointment of counsel, for the preparation of a transcript of the trial proceedings and, ultimately, for the leave to appeal in forma pauperis. The case before us illustrates the point. Petitioner was indicted on June 16, 1958, for offenses alleged to have been committed in early December 1957. He was first tried and convicted in December 1958. Leave to appeal in forma pauperis was granted by the District Court, and on June 23, 1959, the Court of Appeals reversed the conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. 106 U.S.App.D.C. 275, 272 F.2d 504. In October 1959, new counsel was appointed by the District Court to represent petitioner at his second trial. Pre-trial motions were argued in the District Court in December 1959 and January 1960, and petitioner's trial took place in the first week of March 1960. Petitioner was convicted and then sentenced on March 11, 1960. On March 22, 1960, the District Court denied an application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. An application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis was then directed to the Court of Appeals, and was filed in that court on April 15, 1960. On April 20, that court appointed counsel to represent petitioner, and on June 15, 1960, counsel filed a 30-page memorandum in support of the petition for leave to appeal. The following day, the Government answered with a memorandum stating that it believed it appropriate for the court to order the preparation of a transcript at government expense before ruling on the petition for leave to appeal. Petitioner objected to this procedure on the grounds that his memorandum sufficiently indicated that non-frivolous issues were present in his case and that further delay in allowing the appeal was, therefore, unwarranted. On July 1, 1960, the Court of Appeals ordered the preparation of a transcript at the expense of the United States. The transcript became available August 15, 1960, and the Government's opposition to petitioner's application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis was filed, pursuant to an extension of time granted by the court, on September 2, 1960. The Government, misconceiving the issue as we understand it, claimed the points sought to be raised were 'not sufficiently substantial' to warrant an appeal in forma pauperis; it did not suggest the appeal sought was 'frivolous.' Petitioner filed a reply memorandum on September 8. On November 5, 1960, the court, one judge dissenting, denied the petition for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. The petition for certiorari was filed in this Court on November 16, 1960, and was granted on June 19, 1961. 366 U.S. 959, 81 S.Ct. 1926, 6 L.Ed.2d 1252. We heard oral argument in December 1961, and our present disposition of the case, remanding it for reconsideration by the Court of Appeals on an intermediary step, still far from the end of petitioner's course through the courts on his original conviction, is now ordered more than four years after the commission of the offenses for which petitioner was tried and more than two years from the date of the trial and judgment petitioner seeks to have reviewed.17\n\n\n13\nIn the light of this delay, it is not surprising that petitioner asks us to reach the merits of his case immediately. However, delay alone, unfortunate though it is, is not sufficient cause to bypass the orderly processes of judicial review. Contrary to the Government's assertion here that petitioner has already received what amounts to plenary review of the conviction following his second trial, we hold petitioner has not yet received the benefits of presenting either oral argument or full briefs on the merits of his claims to the court first charged with the supervision of the trial court.18 The memoranda prepared by counsel in support of petitioner's application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis were not intended to be, nor are they rightly considered as, full appeallate briefs. But they do serve to demonstrate that petitioner sought consideration of issues that it would be difficult for an appellate court to consider so patently frivolous as to require a dismissal of petitioner's case without full briefing or argument. In so saying, we need not, and do not, express any opinion on whether petitioner's conviction should ultimately be affirmed or reversed. We only hold that taken as a whole, petitioner's various claims cannot justify the summary disposition of his case ordered below.\n\n\n14\nThe first of numerous claims asserted by the petitioner is that the indictment against him was procured through the use of perjured testimony before the grand jury. This Court has not yet decided whether such a charge, if proven, would require the reversal of a criminal conviction based upon an indictment returned by a grand jury hearing the perjury. But we have granted certiorari and given full consideration to related issues in other cases. See, e.g., Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 76 S.Ct. 406, 100 L.Ed. 397 (hearsay evidence considered by grand jury); Lawn v. United States, 355 U.S. 339, 78 S.Ct. 311, 2 L.Ed.2d 321 (illegally seized evidence considered by grand jury); Beck v. Washington, 369 U.S. 541, 82 S.Ct. 955, 8 L.Ed.2d 98 (alleged inflammatory publicity surrounding state grand jury deliberations).\n\n\n15\nPetitioner also claims that he has been unable to prove his charge that prejured testimony was presented to the grand jury because of the refusal of the courts below to permit him to examine the transcript of the grand jury's proceedings. Again, although in the particular context of this case access to the normally secret minutes of the grand jury may ultimately be held to have been properly denied, recent volumes of the United States Reports and the Federal Reporter include a number of opinions in which the extent of the secrey normally attached to grand jury minutes has been explored.19\n\n\n16\nA number of other arguable claims were also made by petitioner to support his application for leave to appeal. But we believe those mentioned would alone have warranted the allowance of an appeal in forma pauperis. They meet the test of being sufficiently reasonable to withstand a claim that their frivolity is so manifest that they merit no further argument or consideration, and that dismissal of petitioner's case is, therefore, in order. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n17\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n18\nJudgment of Court of Appeals vacated and case remanded with directions.\n\n\n19\nMr. Justice FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\n\n20\nMr. Justice WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n21\nMr. Justice STEWART, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN agrees, concurring.\n\n\n22\nIn joining the opinion and judgment of the Court, I think it appropriate to add a few words. The rule of Ellis v. United States is a simple one. An appeal in forma pauperis must be allowed in a criminal case 'unless the issues raised are so frivolous that the appeal would be dismissed in the case of a nonindigent litigant.' 356 U.S. 674, 675, 78 S.Ct. 974, 975, 2 L.Ed.2d 1060. The difficulties which the Courts of Appeals have encountered in applying this simple and practical test are largely, I think, of their own making.\n\n\n23\nThese difficulties may stem in part from a failure to consider the in forma pauperis statute in the context of the over-all scheme governing criminal appeals. Our statutes and rules make an appeal in a criminal case a matter of right. The provisions governing appeals in forma pauperis are not to be read as diluting that right by imposing a more stringent test of merit. Rather, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915 provides at most a device for advance screening of appeals which, if paid, would upon motion be dismissed before argument as frivolous. The only justification for such a preliminary screening is the absence of the built-in pecuniary brake upon frivolous appeals which is present in nonindigent cases. There is no other difference between paid and unpaid appeals. In both, the burden of showing that the right to appeal has been abused is on the party making the suggestion.\n\n\n24\nIt has been said that a District Court's certification that an appeal is not taken in good faith is entitled to great weight. Johnson v. United States, 352 U.S. 565, 566, 77 S.Ct. 550, 551, 1 L.Ed.2d 593. Nevertheless, if a District Court has denied leave to appeal in forma pauperis, the Court of Appeals has the ultimate responsibility of deciding for itself whether the appeal is frivolous. Justice demands an independent and objective assessment of a district judge's appraisal of his own conduct of a criminal trial. Anything less would impose a disability upon indigent defendants far greater than that contemplated by the preliminary screening provision which \u00a7 1915 permits. The statutory safeguard against overindulgence in free frivolous appeals cannot be allowed to impinge upon the fundamental right of every litigant, rich or poor, to equal consideration before the courts.\n\n\n25\nWhen a Court of Appeals chooses to utilize the preliminary screening device permitted by \u00a7 1915, difficulties of the kind evident in this case frequently arise. The bare application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis seldom furnishes sufficient material for evaluating the weight of the issues involved. For this reason, we have held that in such cases a Court of Appeals must provide the applicant with the assistance of counsel and with a record of sufficient completeness to give him full opportunity to show that the appeal is in 'good faith.' Johnson v. United States, supra; Farley v. United States, 354 U.S. 521, 77 S.Ct. 1371, 1 L.Ed.2d 1529. In the course of such proceedings, however, experience has shown that there may be a tendency to lose sight of the precise issue before the court at this point\u2014whether the appeal is so frivolous that it would be dismissed even if all the fees had been paid. Obviously arguments concerning the weight of the issues raised by an appeal are difficult to disengage from arguments dealing with the ultimate merits of these same issues. Understandably and commendably, counsel for indigent defendants often exert every effort to prove the substantial nature of their clients' claims\u2014an exertion of energy which draws a similar effort from government counsel. The product of these forces is a procedure which may bear close superficial resemblance to the appeal itself.\n\n\n26\nThe result is that a Court of Appeals may come to think of these preliminary proceedings as tantamount to appeals on the merits, and may tend to decide whether or not to grant leave to appeal by appraising the entire case in terms of whether or not reversible error appears. By the same token, when leave to appeal has been denied, and the case has come here, the Government has argued in the past, as it argues in this case, that the preliminary screening procedure was itself the equivalent of an affirmance on the merits. See Lurk v. United States, 366 U.S. 712, 81 S.Ct. 1229, 6 L.Ed.2d 845.\n\n\n27\nThis attempted conversion of the proceedings to determine good faith into a truncated substitute for appeal distorts the purpose of \u00a7 1915, and if accepted, would raise serious questions of due process. The filing of memoranda in support of an application for leave to appeal is not an appeal. The merits of the ultimate issues are not logically involved at this point, but only the weight of those issues. Appellate briefs are not written or submitted. There is no oral argument. The court's mode of considering such memoranda, as a matter of internal machinery, may markedly differ from the process employed in the decision of cases actually on appeal. For all these reasons the interim proceeding permitted by \u00a7 1915 cannot itself be deemed to constitute the appeal to which a person convicted of crime in the federal courts is entitled.\n\n\n28\nIn addition to the danger of equating the 'good faith' determination with the appeal itself, there are other disadvantages inherent in compelling the parties to go through the preliminary procedure permitted by \u00a7 1915. It is a serious imposition upon appointed counsel to require dissipation of energy and time in preliminary skirmishing. Moreover, the delay occasioned by this entended interim proceeding is itself offensive to the ideal of speedy administration of criminal justice.\n\n\n29\nThe primary responsibility for containing within limited bounds the separate 'good faith' proceeding permitted by \u00a7 1915 rests upon those Courts of Appeals which choose to utilize this system of dealing with in forma pauperis appeals. While I would not deny great latitude to the various circuits autonomously to devise their own procedures consistent with their appraisal of local conditions and needs, the courts' duty in this area can be properly achieved only by keeping in mind the very limited test of 'good faith' which the Ellis case established.\n\n\n30\nThis suggests that each Court of Appeals might well consider whether its task could not be more expeditiously and responsibly performed by simply granting applications to appeal from criminal convictions in forma pauperis as a matter of course, and appointing counsel to brief and argue each case on the merits. The Government would then be free in any case to file before argument a motion to dismiss the appeal as frivolous, as every appellee is always free to do. In the absence of such a motion an appeal which after argument appeared clearly without merit could be expeditiously disposed of by summary affirmance, in the secure knowledge that all the issues had been fully canvassed. This procedure, it seems to me, would not only save the time and energy of court and counsel, but would obviate the many difficulties which, as the present case shows, the complicated two-step system is all too likely to produce.\n\n\n31\nMr. Justice CLARK, with whom Mr. Justice HARLAN joins, dissenting.\n\nI.\n\n32\nCongress has provided that no indigent appeal may be taken 'if the trial court certifies in writing that it is not taken in good faith,' i.e., is frivolous. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915(a). With the opinion today the Court for all practical purposes repeals this statute by placing the burden on the Government to sustain such a certification rather than on the indigent to overturn it. This position is a sub silentio reversal of our previous holding in Farley v. United States, 354 U.S. 521, 523, 77 S.Ct. 1371, 1372, 1 L.Ed.2d 1529 (1957), where we said that 'petitioner has not yet been afforded an adequate opportunity to show the Court of Appeals that his claimed errors are not frivolous * * *.' Accord, Johnson v. United States, 352 U.S. 565, 77 S.Ct. 550, 1 L.Ed.2d 593 (1957).1 Moreover, the Court goes against a long line of cases holding that the trial judge's certificate of frivolity is entitled to 'great weight'\u2014a rule which the opinion here notes but fails to recognize. If the finding is entitled to 'great weight,' in fact controlling weight in the absence of 'some showing that the certificate is made without warrant * * *,' Wells v. United States, 318 U.S. 257, 259, 63 S.Ct. 582, 584, 87 L.Ed. 746 (1943), how can it be said the Government has the burden of upholding it' The Court seems to say the burden is upon the Government because when it files a motion to dismiss in a nonindigent case it has the burden of showing frivolity. I submit the two are not at all analogous. In the case of paid appeals Congress has not provided for a determination by the trial court of whether the issues warrant further review, and to treat nonpaid appeals like paid appeals is to ignore such a provision in the statute governing indigent appeals.\n\n\n33\nThe Court does not make clear on what grounds it bases its assumption that the Government has the burden of showing frivolity. It professes to act 'within the statutory framework for appeals created by Congress'; but it intimates that it is 'impelled by considerations beyond the corners of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915,' and the touchstone of its opinion is a principle arising from cases based on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. I do not believe, however, that a disparity in the burden of showing frivolity denies equal justice as between paid and nonpaid appeals. They both remain subject to the same peril. Congress has set up a special procedure which subjects every nonpaid appeal to an examination to determine if further briefing and oral argument are necessary. Such an examination in the case of paid appeals is left to the initiative of the court or the Government. This distinction does not give rise to a discrimination of constitutional proportions. As was pointed out in Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 100, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 1385, 87 L.Ed. 1774 (1943), '(t)he Fifth Amendment contains no equal protection clause and it restrains only such discriminatory legislation by Congress as amounts to a denial of due process. * * * Congress may hit at a particular danger where it is seen, without providing for others which are not so evident or so urgent.' I see no constitutional impediment to asking one who seeks a free ride to show that he is not just a joyrider. Although a government that affords appellate review must pay the cost of meritorious indigent appeals, surely it may protect itself from frivolous ones (which incidentally in numbers overwhelmingly predominate) being 'subsidized and public moneys * * * needlessly spent.' Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 24, 76 S.Ct. 585, 593, 100 L.Ed. 891 (1956) (concurring opinion).\n\nII.\n\n34\nThe Court holds that petitioner is entitled to oral argument in the Court of Appeals on new briefs. An examination of the record shows that the action of the Court of Appeals was on the basis of a complete transcript and extensive briefs filed by counsel. With due deference to the Court's suggestion that these briefs were only preliminary, I find them to be substantially similar in both bulk and substance to the ones filed here on which petitioner asks for a decision on the merits. Upon such presentation the Court of Appeals found itself satisfied that petitioner's conviction was proper. It is true that no oral argument was permitted. However, having come to the conclusion that the case had no merit, the court had to put a stop to the review proceeding. This is true whether the appeal is paid or nonpaid. See United States v. Johnson, 327 U.S. 106, 66 S.Ct. 464, 90 L.Ed. 562 (1946). We adjudicate most of our appeals in the same manner, i.e., by dismissing or affirming on the briefs without argument. Inasmuch as the case had arisen within the procedural confines of appeals in forma pauperis, the Court of Appeals simply denied leave to appeal. It could have granted leave to proceed and then summarily affirmed or dismissed the appeal under Rule 39(a), Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. I see no substantial distinction between the two dispositions.\n\n\n35\nThe Court, however, is remanding the case for further review proceedings because it has concluded that at least two of petitioner's claims are not frivolous and that the Court of Appeals therefore erred in not allowing the review to run its full length. The Court in reaching this conclusion has, in my view, misplaced the burden on the issue of frivolity, but even assuming arguendo that petitioner's contentions are not frivolous, I cannot agree to the fruitless approach the Court has taken.\n\n\n36\nTo be sure, frivolity or some analogous standard delimits those appeals, paid or nonpaid, which can be decided without oral argument. However, it would seem that any error by a Court of Appeals in evaluating frivolity upon such a full presentation as was had below is often not only incorrectable but harmless. Concededly, this Court has of late consistently remanded cases in which a Court of Appeals has mistakenly characterized contentions as frivolous. Experience has shown this tack to be unsatisfactory, and perhaps it is now time to re-evaluate our approach.\n\n\n37\nThis is not to say that we should do a complete turn about and never remand a case for further review. What I am suggesting is that we give substance to the congressional mandate and yet analyze, inter alia, the thoroughness of the review below, the character of the issues raised, the beneficiality of further action by a lower court, and the strength or weakness of the contentions made. Applying such criteria to the present case, I am convinced that to remand this case will only compel the lower court to go through wasteful formalities to the detriment of its consideration of other appeals and put off to another day action by this Court.2 The Court speaks of long delays, but by remanding it appears to have contributed to the very evil which it seeks to eliminate. I would follow the teaching of Pollard v. United States, 352 U.S. 354, 77 S.Ct. 481, 1 L.Ed.2d 393 (1957), and Holiday v. Johnston, 313 U.S. 342, 61 S.Ct. 1015, 85 L.Ed. 1392 (1941), and decide the merits of petitioner's contentions now. I therefore dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n During the past five Terms of the Court, we have found it necessary to vacate and remand for reconsideration 14 cases in which a Court of Appeals has applied an erroneous standard in passing on an indigent's application for leave to appeal.

Robinson, 361 U.S. 220, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259, a liberal view of papers filed by indigent and incarcerated defendants, as equivalents of notices of appeal, has been used to preserve the jurisdiction of the Courts of Appeals. See, e.g., Lemke v. United States, 346 U.S. 325, 74 S.Ct. 1, 98 L.Ed. 3 (notice of appeal filed prior to judgment); O'Neal v. United States, 272 F.2d 412 (C.A.5th Cir.)

United States, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 212, 188 F.2d 41 (notice of appeal delivered to prison officials for forwarding to District Court). See also Jordan v. United States District Court, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 160, 233 F.2d 362, vacated on other grounds sub nom. Jordan v. United States, 352 U.S. 904, 77 S.Ct. 151, 1 L.Ed.2d 114 (mandamus petition filed in Court of Appeals held equivalent of notice of appeal from judgment in proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255); West v. United States, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 46, 222 F.2d 774 (petition for leave to appeal in forma pauperis filed in Court of Appeals held equivalent in \u00a7 2255 case).\nFurther, Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. 37(a)(2) expressly provides:\n'When a court after trial imposes sentence upon a defendant not represented by counsel, the defendant shall be advised of his right to appeal and if he so requests, the clerk shall prepare and file forthwith a notice of appeal on behalf of the defendant.'\nThe salutary purpose of this provision may, however, not be achieved when the defendant appears at sentencing with counsel. If neither counsel, whether retained or court appointed, nor the district judge imposing sentence, notifies the defendant of the requirement for filing a prompt notice of appeal, the right of appeal may irrevocably be lost. Cf. Hodges v. United States, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 375, 282 F.2d 858, cert. granted, 365 U.S. 810, 81 S.Ct. 702, 5 L.Ed.2d 690, cert. dismissed as improvidently granted, 368 U.S. 139, 140\u2014141, 82 S.Ct. 235, 236\u2014237, 7 L.Ed.2d 184 (dissent); Lewis and Simms v.

Stenographic transcripts in the federal courts cost $0.65 per page for the first copy, and $0.30 per page for additional copies. Transcripts in excess of 100 pages are not uncommon. The cost of printing briefs, records, and appendices, as illustrated by the present charge for printing records in this Court, may be $3.80 per page or more. The printing requirements are generally waived in appeals proceeding in forma pauperis. Cf. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 75(m), 28 U.S.C.A. But if, in such cases, printing is required by the Court of Appeals, the expense is borne by the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915(a).\n\n\n7\n The statute appears to contemplate an initial application to the District Court by providing 'An appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis if the trial court certifies in writing that it is not taken in good faith.' 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915(a). And this is the manner in which the statute has been interpreted. See, e.g., West v. United States, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 46, 222 F.2d 774; Waterman v. McMillan, 77 U.S.App.D.C. 310, 135 F.2d 807; Murrey v. United States, 134 F.2d 956 (C.A.8th Cir.); Bayless v. Johnston, 127 F.2d 531 (C.A.9th Cir.). And see Rules of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit 41(a). But cf. Jordan v. United States District Court, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 160, 163, 233 F.2d 362, 365 note 3, vacated on other grounds sub nom. Jordan v. United States, 352 U.S. 904, 77 S.Ct. 151, 1 L.Ed.2d 114.\n\n\n8\n In discussing the 'good faith' requirement of what is now 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915(a). Senator Bacon of the Senate Judiciary Committee said:\n'When a judge has heard a case and it is about to be carried to an appellate court, he * * * is in a position to judge whether it is a case proceeding captiously, or viciously, or with prejudice, or from any other improper motive, or whether the litigant is proceeding in good faith.' 45 Cong.Rec. 1533 (1910).\nHowever, he was discussing primarily civil suits. And see Jaffe v. United States, 246 F.2d 760 (C.A.2d Cir.) (civil case). But in criminal cases cf. Cash v. United States, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 265, 269, 261 F.2d 731, 735, vacated, 357 U.S. 219, 78 S.Ct. 1365, 2 L.Ed.2d 1361; Parsell v. United States, 218 F.2d 232 (C.A.5th Cir.). See also United States v. Visconti, 261 F.2d 215 (C.A.2d Cir.) (proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255).\n\n\n9\n And see Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. 39(a); Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 12(f).\n\n\n10\n 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915 expressly authorizes '(a)ny court of the United States' to permit a litigant to proceed in forma pauperis. Thus it is not necessary to consider the application to the Court of Appeals a separate 'appeal' from the order of the District Court denying relief, to which the time requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure would be applicable as they are to appeals in other ancillary post-conviction proceedings. Cf. Roberts v. United States District Court, 339 U.S. 844, 845, 70 S.Ct. 954, 955, 94 L.Ed. 1326. The court below has, by its own Rule 41(b), required all persons seeking leave to appeal a judgment of the District Court in forma pauperis, to apply for such leave from the Court of Appeals within 30 days of the date on which their applications for such relief from the District Court have been denied. The instant petitioner has complied with this Rule.\n\n\n11\n Johnson v. United States, 352 U.S. 565, 566, 77 S.Ct. 550, 551, 1 L.Ed.2d 593.\n\n\n12\n Johnson v.

Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891, in which we were presented with a state law requiring defendants in all criminal cases in that State to furnish a bill of exceptions to the appellate court in which they sought review of their convictions. The bill of exceptions was difficult, if not impossible, to prepare without a stenographic transcript of the trial proceedings. Persons sentenced to death received transcripts at the expense of the State; all others were required to purchase a transcript. We found the failure of the State to provide for appellate review for indigents in noncapital cases, when such review was available for all defendants able to purchase transcripts, an 'invidious discrimination' inconsistent with the guarantees of due process and equal protection of the laws of the Fourteenth Amendment. See also Eskridge v. Washington State Board, 357 U.S. 214, 78 S.Ct. 1061, 2 L.Ed.2d 1269; Ross v. Schneckloth, 357 U.S. 575, 78 S.Ct. 1387, 2 L.Ed.2d 1547; Burns v.

Bennett, 365 U.S. 708, 81 S.Ct. 895, 6 L.Ed.2d 39, in which comparable state rules and practices, effectively limiting the poor person's access to courts ostensibly open to all, similarly have been found vulnerable.\n\n\n14\n See Brown v.

United States, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 326, 328, 266 F.2d 924, 926. There, Judge Bazelon pointed out that of 86 criminal appeals considered by the Court of Appeals within a period of approximately 15 months, 18 were prepaid, while 68 were considered after either the District Court or the Court of Appeals had granted leave to appeal in forma pauperis. Of this total, 14 of the prepaid appeals resulted in a judgment affirming the conviction; a similar majority of the paupers' appeals resulted in affirmance. However, during a comparable span between September 1, 1957, and February 28, 1959, 24 criminal appeals were decided by the Court of Appeals in which the District Court had initially denied leave to appeal in forma pauperis. In 11 of those 24 cases, reversals were ordered, and in 6 more, one of the three judges of the court's panel dissented from the judgment affirming the conviction. During those same 18 months, the court granted 31 of 47 petitions for leave to take a direct appeal in forma pauperis from a conviction, and this Court subsequently reversed the denials of leave to appeal ordered in the cases of 5 of the 16 unsuccessful applicants in the court below.\n\n\n17\n The instant case is not unique in this regard. See, e.g., Johnson: Indicted (March 1956), tried (May 1956), appeal in forma pauperis denied, 238 F.2d 565 (C.A.2d Cir.1956), vacated, 352 U.S. 565, 77 S.Ct. 550, 1 L.Ed.2d 593 (1957), conviction affirmed on the merits, 254 F.2d 175, petition for certiorari dismissed per stipulation of parties, 357 U.S. 933, 78 S.Ct. 1378, 2 L.Ed.2d 1369 (June 1958); Farley: Indicted (December 1955), tried (May 1956), application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis remanded to District Court, 238 F.2d 575 (C.A.2d Cir.1956), appeal in forma pauperis denied, 242 F.2d 338, vacated, 354 U.S. 521, 77 S.Ct. 1371, 1 L.Ed.2d 1529 (1957), remanded to District Court for settling transcript (December 1960), appeal in forma pauperis granted by District Court (May 1961), conviction affirmed on the merits, 292 F.2d 789 (1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 857, 82 S.Ct. 937 (April 1962); Ellis: Indicted (April 1956), tried (September 1956), appeal in forma pauperis denied, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 386, 249 F.2d 478 (1957), vacated, 356 U.S. 674, 78 S.Ct. 974, 2 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1958), conviction affirmed on the merits, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 86, 264 F.2d 372, cert. denied, 359 U.S. 998, 79 S.Ct. 1129, 3 L.Ed.2d 986 (May 1959), motion for leave to file petition for rehearing denied, 361 U.S. 945, 80 S.Ct. 407, 4 L.Ed.2d 365 (January 1960).\n\n\n18\n This argument was also presented by the Government, and then rejected by us, in Lurk v.

O'NEIL.\nNo. 336.\nArgued March 24, 1971.\nDecided June 1, 1971.\n\nSyllabus\nRespondent and one Runnels were charged with committing various crimes and at their joint trial offered an alibi defense. A police officer testified that Runnels had orally admitted the crimes and implicated respondent. Runnels, who took the stand, denied making the statement. The trial judge ruled that Runnels' alleged statement was inadmissible hearsay as to respondent and could not be considered by the jury in deciding whether respondent was guilty. Respondent also took the stand on his own behalf and gave the same version of their activities as Runnels. Both defendants were found guilty, and after unsuccessful efforts to have his conviction set aside, respondent applied for habeas corpus relief. The District Court ruled that respondent's conviction was improper under Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476, and Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100, which held that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment as made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth is violated where a codefendant's out-of-court hearsay statement is admitted into evidence without the declarant's being available at trial for 'full and effective' cross-examination by the defendant, and that a cautionary instruction to the jury does not adequately protect the defendant where the codefendant does not testify. The Court of Appeals affirmed, stressing that effective confrontation of a witness who has allegedly made an out-of-court statement implicating the defendant was possible only if the witness affirmed the statement as his. Held: Where a codefendant takes the stand in his own defense, denies making an alleged out-of-court statement implicating the defendant, and testifies in the defendant's favor, the defendant has been denied no rights protected by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments and in the circumstances of this case respondent, who would have encountered greater difficulty had Runnels affirmed the statement as his, was denied neither the opportunity nor the benefit of fully and effectively cross-examining Runnels. Bruton, supra, distinguished. Pp. 626 630.\n422 F.2d 319, reversed and remanded.\nCharles R.B. Kirk, San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\nJ. Strouse Campbell, Arlington, Va., for respondent.\nMr. Justice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe respondent, Joe O'Neil, was arrested along with a man named Runnels when the police of Culver City, California, answered a midnight call from a liquor store reporting that two men in a white Cadillac were suspiciously cruising about in the neighborhood. The police responded to the call, spotted the Cadillac, and followed it into an alley where a gun was thrown from one of its windows. They then stopped the car and apprehended the respondent and Runnels. Further investigation revealed that the car had been stolen about 10:30 that night in Los Angeles by two men who had forced its owner at gunpoint to drive them a distance of a few blocks and then had robbed him of $8 and driven off. The victim subsequently picked Runnels and the respondent from a lineup, positively identifying them as the men who had kidnaped and robbed him.\n\n\n2\nArraigned on charges of kidnaping, robbery, and vehicle theft, both the respondent and Runnels pleaded not guilty, and at their joint trial they offered an alibi defense. Each told the same story: they had spent the evening at the respondent's home until about 11 p.m., when they had left together. While waiting at a bus stop they were picked up by a friend driving a white cadillac, and he offered to lend them the car for a few hours while he went into a nightclub. They accepted the offer, and once on their way discovered that there was a gun in the glove compartment. They entered an alley in search of a place to dispose of the gun, since they were afraid of being stopped with it in the car. Soon after throwing the gun out of the window they were stopped by the police and arrested. The supposed friend was not called as a witness and was not shown to be unavailable, but other witnesses corroborated parts of their alibi testimony.\n\n\n3\nThe owner of the white Cadillac made a positive in-court identification of the defendants, and a police officer testified to the facts of the arrest. Another police officer testified that after the arrest Runnels had made an unsworn oral statement admitting the crimes and implicating the respondent as his confederate. The trial judge ruled the officer's testimony as to the substance of the alleged statement admissible against Runnels, but instructed the jury that it could not consider it against the respondent. When Runnels took the stand in his own defense, he was asked on direct examination whether he had made the statement, and he flatly denied having done so. He also vigorously asserted that the substance of the statement imputed to him was false. He was then intensively cross-examined by the prosecutor, but stuck to his story in every particular. The respondent's counsel did not cross-examine Runnels, although he was, of course, fully free to do so. The respondent took the stand on his own behalf and told a story identical to that of Runnels as to the activities of the two on the night in question. Both the prosecutor and Runnels' counsel discussed the alleged confession in their closing arguments to the jury, and the trial judge repeated his instruction that it could be considered only against Runnels.\n\n\n4\nThe jury found both defendants guilty as charged. After unsuccessful efforts to set aside the conviction in the California courts, the respondent applied for federal habeas corpus relief in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and while the case was pending there this Court decided Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476, and Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100, holding that under certain circumstances the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment,1 applicable to the States through the Fourteenth,2 is violated when a codefendant's confession implicating the defendant is placed before the jury at their joint trial.3 The District Court ruled that the respondent's conviction had to be set aside under Bruton and Roberts, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 422 F.2d 319 (1970). Petitioner then sought a writ of certiorari in this Court, contending, first, that there was no constitutional error under Bruton and Roberts, second, that any error there might have been was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under the doctrine of Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, and, third, that the District Court should have required the respondent first to seek redress in the state courts, which had had no opportunity to consider the Bruton claim. We granted certiorari to consider these issues. 400 U.S. 901, 91 S.Ct. 136, 27 L.Ed.2d 137. Since we agree with the petitioner that there was no violation of the Constitution in this case, it is unnecessary to consider the other questions presented.\n\n\n5\nRunnels' out-of-court confession implicating the respondent was hearsay as to the latter, and therefore inadmissible against him under state evidence law. The trial judge so ruled, and instructed the jury that it must not consider any part of the statement in deciding whether or not the respondent was guilty. In Bruton, however, we held that, quite apart from the law of evidence, such a cautionary instruction to the jury is not an adequate protection for the defendant where the codefendant does not take the witness stand. We held that where the jury hears the codefendant's confession implicating the defendant, the codefendant becomes in substance, if not in form, a 'witness' against the defendant. The defendant must constitutionally have an opportunity to 'confront' such a witness. This the defendant cannot do if the codefendant refuses to take the stand.\n\n\n6\nIt was clear in Bruton that the 'confrontation' guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments is confrontation at trial\u2014that is, that the absence of the defendant at the time the codefendant allegedly made the out-of-court statement is immaterial, so long as the declarant can be cross-examined on the witness stand at trial. This was confirmed in California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489, where we said that '(v)iewed historically * * * there is good reason to conclude that the Confrontation Clause is not violated by admitting a declarant's out-of-court statements, as long as the declarant is testifying as a witness and subject to full and effective cross-examination.' Id., at 158, 90 S.Ct., at 1935. Moreover, 'where the declarant is not absent, but is present to testify and to submit to cross-examination, our cases, if anything, support the conclusion that the admission of his out-of-court statements does not create a confrontation problem.' Id., at 162, 90 S.Ct., at 1937. This is true, of course, even though the declarant's out-of-court statement is hearsay as to the defendant, so that its admission against him, in the absence of a cautionary instruction, would be reversible error under state law. The Constitution as construed in Bruton, in other words, is violated only where the out-of-court hearsay statement is that of a declarant who is unavailable at the trial for 'full and effective' cross-examination.\n\n\n7\nThe question presented by this case, then, is whether cross-examination can be full and effective where the declarant is present at the trial, takes the witness stand, testifies fully as to his activities during the period described in his alleged out-of-court statement, but denies that he made the statement and claims that its substance is false.\n\n\n8\nIn affirming the District Court, the Court of Appeals relied heavily on the dictum of this Court in Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415, 420, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 1077, 13 L.Ed.2d 934, that 'effective confrontation' of a witness who has allegedly made an out-of-court statement implicating the defendant 'was possible only if (the witness) affirmed the statement as his.' The Court in that case also remarked that the witness 'could not be cross-examined on a statement imputed to but not admitted by him.' Id., at 419, 85 S.Ct., at 1077. Of course, a witness can be cross-examined concerning a statement not 'affirmed' by him, but this dictum from Douglas was repeated in Bruton, supra, 391 U.S., at 127, 88 S.Ct., at 1623. In Douglas and Bruton (and in the other confrontation cases before Green)4 there was in fact no question of the effect of an affirmance or denial of the incriminating statement, since the witness or codefendant was in each case totally unavailable at the trial for any kind of cross-examination. The specific holding of the Court in Bruton was:\n\n\n9\n'Plainly, the introduction of (the codefendant's) confession      added substantial, perhaps even critical, weight to the      Government's case in a form not subject to cross-examination,      since (the codefendant) did not take the stand. Petitioner      thus was denied his constitutional right of confrontation.'      391 U.S., at 127\u2014128, 88 S.Ct., at 1623.\n\n\n10\nThis Court has never gone beyond that holding.\n\n\n11\nIn California v. Green, supra, the defendant was accused of furnishing marihuana to a minor, partly on the basis of an unsworn statement, not subject to cross-examination, made by the minor himself while he was under arrest for selling the drug. When the minor, not a codefendant, took the stand at the defendant's trial, he claimed that he could not remember any of the incriminating events described in his out-of-court statement, although he admitted having made the statement and claimed that he believed it when he made it. The earlier statement was then introduced in evidence to show the truth of the matter asserted, and this Court held it admissible for that purpose. The circumstances of Green are inverted in this case. There, the witness affirmed the out-of-court statement but was unable to testify in court as to the underlying facts; here, the witness, Runnels, denied ever making an out-of-court statement but testified at length, and favorably to the defendant, concerning the underlying facts.\n\n\n12\nHad Runnels in this case 'affirmed the statement as his,' the respondent would certainly have been in far worse straits than those in which he found himself when Runnels testified as he did. For then counsel for the respondent could only have attempted to show through cross-examination that Runnels had confessed to a crime he had not committed, or, slightly more plausibly, that those parts of the confession implicating the respondent were fabricated. This would, moreover, have required an abandonment of the joint alibi defense, and the production of a new explanation for the respondent's presence with Runnels in the white Cadillac at the time of their arrest. To be sure, Runnels might have 'affirmed the statement' but denied its truthfulness, claiming, for example, that it had been coerced, or made as part of a plea bargain. But cross-examination by the respondents' counsel would have been futile in that event as will. For once Runnels had testified that the statement was false, it could hardly have profited the respondent for his counsel through cross-examination to try to shake that testimony. If the jury were to believe that the statement was false as to Runnels, it could hardly conclude that it was not false as to the respondent as well.\n\n\n13\nThe short of the matter is that, given a joint trial and a common defense, Runnels' testimony respecting his alleged out-of-court statement was more favorable to the respondent than any that cross-examination by counsel could possibly have produced, had Runnels 'affirmed the statement as his.' It would be unrealistic in the extreme in the circumstances here presented to hold that the respondent was denied either the opportunity or the benefit of full and effective cross-examination of Runnels.\n\n\n14\nWe conclude that where a codefendant takes the stand in his own defense, denies making an alleged out-of-court statement implicating the defendant, and proceeds to testify favorably to the defendant concerning the underlying facts, the defendant has been denied no rights protected by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n15\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n16\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n17\nMr. Justice HARLAN, concurring.\n\n\n18\nI join in the opinion and judgment of the Court. I would, however, go further and hold that, because respondent's conviction became final before this Court decided Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), he cannot avail himself of that new rule in subsequent federal habeas corpus proceedings. See Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S. 667, 675, 91 S.Ct. 1160, 1171, 28 L.Ed.2d 404, 410 (1971) (separate opinion of this writer).\n\n\n19\nIt is difficult to fathom what public policy is served by opening the already overcrowed federal courts to claims such as these. Respondent's trial and appeals were, at the time they occurred, conducted in a manner perfectly consistent with then-prevailing constitutional norms. A reversal of the conviction now would either compel the State to place an already once-tried case again on its criminal docket, to be retried on substantially the same (but now more stale) evidence or else force the State to forego its interest in enforcing in this instance its criminal laws relating to kidnaping, robbery, and car theft because of the disappearance of evidence. Conversely, if federal habeas relief is denied on the merits, as it now is by this Court, the energies of the federal courts have been expended to no good purpose.\n\n\n20\nTo justify such a serious interference with the State's powers to enforce its criminal law and the ability of federal courts to provide full, fair, and prompt hearings to those who have no other forum available should require the presence of a most substantial countervailing societal interest. But what interest is conceivably promoted by further adjudication of the contentions respondent urges upon us? Surely, indulging his claims does not serve the function of assuring that state courts properly apply governing constitutional standards. For this is precisely what the California courts did in this case. See, e.g., Delli Paoli v. United States, 352 U.S. 232, 77 S.Ct. 294, 1 L.Ed.2d 278 (1957). Nor can it plausibly be argued that we perceive in this case serious issues as to whether respondent was in fact likely innocent of the crime for which he was convicted or whether he was subjected to an intolerable abuse of the prosecutorial function that rendered his trial fundamentally unfair.\n\n\n21\nThe only rationale I can imagine that might support entertaining Bruton claims in federal habeas proceedings brought by state prisoners whose convictions and become final prior to the decision in Bruton and who had a full and fair opportunity to litigate their claims at trial and on appeal, is the notion that Bruton is somehow an unimpeachably correct decision, so infallibly just that other earlier decisions inconsistent with it must be treated as though they had never been made. Even were this a tenable position, the fact is, as the Court notes, that respondent is actually seeking an extension of the Bruton holding. More importantly, for me such an 'infallibility' argument could rest on nothing more than the fanciful notion that perception of ultimate constitutional verity is always to be found in those who 'came after' to this Court.\n\n\n22\nSuch a drastic disruption of judicial processes and alteration of our traditional federal-state balance should be supported by more persuasive considerations than those which led the Court in Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1968), to hold the Bruton rule fully 'retroactive' in application. I venture to repeat what I stated earlier this Term in Mackey, supra:\n\n\n23\n'No one, not criminal defendants, not the judicial system,      not society as a whole is benefited by a judgment providing a      man shall tentatively go to jail today, but tomorrow and      every day thereafter his continued incarceration shall be      subject to fresh litigation on issues already resolved.' 401      U.S., at 667, 91 S.Ct., at 1179.\n\n\n24\nI think it unfortunate that substantial federal judicial energies have been expended, for virtually no purpose at all, on the adjudication of this habeas proceeding. Since the Court has decided to address the merits of respondent's contentions, however, I unreservedly join in its resolution of them.\n\n\n25\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting.\n\n\n26\nWith all deference, I think the Court asks and answers the wrong question in this case. Under the law of California at the time of respondent's trial, admissions to a police officer by a criminal defendant after his arrest could not be used as substantive evidence against other defendants, whether or not the declarant testified at trial.1 The question with which we are faced is not, therefore, whether the Sixth Amendment would forbid California from using Runnels' statement as substantive evidence against respondent O'Neil if it chose to do so. California rejected that choice: the jury in the present case was explicitly instructed that Runnels' statement could not be considered as evidence against O'Neil. The question therefore, is whether California, having determined for whatever reason that the statement involved in this case was inadmissible against respondent, may nevertheless present the statement to the jury that was to decide respondent's guilt, and instruct that jury that it should not be considered against respondent. I think our cases compel the conclusion that it may not.\n\n\n27\nIn Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), we reviewed a federal trial in which the extrajudicial confession of one Evans, which implicated both Evans and Bruton in the crime charged, was set before the jury along with instructions that it could be considered as evidence only against Evans. Evans himself did not testify. We held, first, that the Sixth Amendment in those circumstances forbade the use against Bruton of Evans' statement; and second, that since there was a 'substantial risk that the jury, despite instructions to the contrary, looked to the incriminating extrajudicial statements in determining (Bruton's) guilt,' the Sixth Amendment required that Bruton's conviction be reversed. Id., at 126, 88 S.Ct., at 1622.\n\n\n28\nShortly thereafter, we made clear that the second prong of our holding in Bruton\u2014that instructing juries not to use one defendant's admissions against the other could not, in fact, prevent them from making such a use\u2014had a constitutional basis.2 In Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1968), we reviewed a state criminal trial presenting facts substantially identical to those presented in Bruton. Roberts and one Rappe had been jointly tried on charges to which Rappe had confessed to a police officer. Rappe's confession implicated both himself and Roberts; it was presented to the jury together with instructions that Rappe's extrajudicial statements could be considered as evidence only against Rappe, and not against Roberts. As in Bruton, we reversed. Roberts v. Russell, therefore, must stand for the proposition that as a constitutional matter, the risk that a jury will not follow instructions to disregard the statements of one codefendant against another is too great to tolerate in a criminal trial. For, as we pointed out in Bruton, 'If it were true that the jury disregarded the reference to the codefendant, no question would arise under the Confrontation Clause, because by hypothesis the case is treated as if the confessor made no statement inculpating the nonconfessor.' 391 U.S., at 126, 88 S.Ct., at 1622.\n\n\n29\nBruton and Roberts, therefore, compel the conclusion that the Federal Constitution forbids the States to assume that juries can follow instructions that tell them to wipe their minds of highly damaging, incriminating admissions of one defendant that simultaneously incriminate another defendant whose guilt or innocence the jury is told to decide. In the present case, California itself has made the judgment that, although Runnels did take the stand, his extrajudicial statements could not be considered by the jury as evidence against respondent. Under Bruton and Roberts, California having made the determination that Runnels' statement could not be considered as evidence against O'Neil may not subvert its own judgment in some but not all cases by presenting the inadmissible evidence to the jury and telling the jury to disregard it. For the inevitable result of this procedure is that, in fact, different rules of evidence will be applied to different defendants depending solely upon the fortuity of whether they are jointly or separately tried. This is a discrimination that the Constitution forbids.\n\n\n30\nAccordingly, I would affirm the judgment below. In no event, however, would I reach the question decided by the Court in this case. For if we assume that the jury did follow its instructions to disregard Runnels' statement against respondent, his complaint is obviously without foundation. If we assume that it did not, we still need not reach the question whether California could constitutionally allow Runnels' statements to be used as evidence against respondent, for California has not purported to do so.3 Having made that judgment, California is bound to apply it to all defendants or to none. I dissent.\n\n\n31\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, dissenting.\n\n\n32\nThis case dramatically illustrates the need for the adoption of new rules regulating the use of joint trials. Here there is no question that Runnels' alleged statement to the police was not admissible under state law against O'Neil. But as my Brother BRENNAN points out and as this Court recognized in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), there is a very real danger that the statement was in fact used against O'Neil.\n\n\n33\nThose that argue for the use of joint trials contend that joint trials, although often resulting in prejudice to recognized rights of one or more of the codefendants, are justified because of the saving of time, money, and energy that result. But, as this case shows, much of the supposed saving is lost through protracted litigation that results from the impingement or near impingement on a codefendant's rights of confrontation and equal protection.\n\n\n34\nThe American Bar Association's Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Advisory Committee on the Criminal Trial, suggested that if a defendant in a joint trial moves for a severance because the prosecutor intends to introduce an out-of-court statement by his codefendant that is inadmissible against the moving defendant, then the trial court should require the prosecutor) to elect between a joint trial in which the statement is excluded; a joint trial at which the statement is admitted but the portion that refers to the moving defendant is effectively deleted; and severance.* I believe that the adoption of such a practice is the only way in which the recurring problems of confrontation and equal protection can be eliminated.\n\n\n\n1\n The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution provides that '(i)n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him * * *.'\n\n\n2\n See Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923; Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934.\n\n\n3\n Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100, held that the decision in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476, is applicable to the States and is to be applied retroactively.\n\n\n4\n Brookhart v. Janies, 384 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314; Barber v. Page, 390 U.S. 719, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 20 L.Ed.2d 255; Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100; Harrington v.

The California Evidence Code, presently in effect, did not become operative until January 1, 1967.\n\n\n2\n This point was explicitly made in Bruton itself by Mr. Justice Stewart:\n'(C)ertain kinds of hearsay * * * are at once so damaging, so suspect, and yet so difficult to discount, that jurors cannot be trusted to give such evidence the minimal weight it logically deserves, whatever instructions the trial judge might give.' 391 U.S., at 138, 88 S.Ct., at 1629 (concurring opinion) (emphasis in original).\n\n\n3\n See n. 1, supra.\n\n\n*\n Section 2.3 of the American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Joinder and Severance (Approved Draft 1968) provides:\n'Severance of defendants.\n'(a) When a defendant moves for a severance because an out-of-court statement of a codefendant makes reference to him but is not admissible against him, the court should determine whether the prosecution intends to offer the statement in evidence at the trial. If so, the court should require the prosecuting attorney to elect one of the following courses:\n'(i) a joint trial at which the statement is not admitted into evidence;\n'(ii) a joint trial at which the statement is admitted into evidence only after all references to the moving defendant have been effectively deleted; or\n'(iii) severance of the moving defendant.'\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"373 U.S. 334\n83 S.Ct. 1236\n10 L.Ed.2d 383\nAlbert ANDREWS, Petitioner,v.UNITED STATES.  Robert L. DONOVAN, Petitioner,  v.  UNITED STATES.\nNos. 491 and 494.\nArgued March 25 and 26, 1963.\nDecided May 20, 1963.\n\nE. Barrett Prettyman, Jr., Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\nWayne G. Barnett, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nMr. Justice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe two petitioners and a co-defendant were convicted in a Federal District Court upon a three-court indictment charging that they had (1) assaulted a Post Office employee with intent to rob in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2114, (2) put the life of the Post Office employee in jeopardy by the use of a dangerous weapon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2114, and (3) conspired together to violate the aforesaid statute in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. The district judge sentenced each defendant to concurrent prison terms of 25 years on Count 2 and five years on Count 3.1 None of the defendants was asked before the sentences were imposed whether he had anything to say in his own behalf. On appeal, the convictions were affirmed, but the cases were remanded to the District Court for resentencing on Count 2, on the ground that the trial judge had been in error in thinking that under the statute2 he was without power to suspend sentence and grant probation on that count. United States v. Donovan, 2 Cir., 242 F.2d 61. Upon remand, the District Court suspended the 25-year sentence which had been imposed on the petitioners' co-defendant, but resentenced the two petitioners to 25-year prison terms. Again, neither petitioner was afforded an opportunity to speak in his own behalf before the sentences were imposed. The Court of Appeals reaffirmed the convictions. United States v. Donovan, 2 Cir., 252 F.2d 788.\n\n\n2\nThe proceedings now before us began when the petitioner Donovan filed a motion in the District Court requesting that his sentence 'be vacated and he be resentenced' on the ground that, contrary to Rule 32(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, he had been afforded no opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf either at the time of the original sentence or when the sentence was reimposed.3 The District Court granted the motion and ordered that Donovan 'be returned to this district for resentencing.' The petitioner Andrews then wrote to Judge Murphy, the district judge who had acted on Donovan's motion, pointing out that 'the identical circumstances exist with me' and asking for similar relief. Judge Murphy ordered that Andrews too be returned to the District Court for resentencing. The Government filed a notice of appeal from both orders, and the resentencing of the petitioners was stayed upon the Government's motion. The Court of Appeals ruled that its appellate jurisdiction had been properly invoked, and on the merits reversed the orders of the District Court, holding that under this Court's decisions in Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. 424, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 and Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 473, the sentencing court's failure to comply with Rule 32(a) did not constitute a ground for collateral relief. 2 Cir., 301 F.2d 376. We granted certiorari, 371 U.S. 812, 83 S.Ct. 57, 9 L.Ed.2d 54.\n\n\n3\nAs to the merits of the issue decided by the Court of Appeals, the petitioners contend that there was here not a mere failure to comply with the formal requirements of Rule 32(a) as in Hill and Machibroda, but that a number of aggravating circumstances accompanied the sentencing court's denial of the petitioners' right of allocution. And the Court's opinions in Hill and Machibroda, say the petitioners, clearly implied that collateral relief would be available in a case where such circumstances were shown to exist. Cf. United States v. Taylor, 4 Cir., 303 F.2d 165, 167\u2014168. But the petitioners argue preliminarily that the Government had no right of appeal in these cases. We agree with the petitioners that the Court of Appeals did not have appellate jurisdiction, and accordingly, without reaching the merits, we set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the cases to the District Court so that the petitioners may be resentenced in accordance with the District Court's orders.\n\n\n4\nThe motion which Donovan filed in the sentencing court was denominated by him as one made under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.4 Anderson's letter did not mention Rule 35, but in an affidavit opposing Anderson's request, an Assistant United States Attorney conceded that the 'factual and legal posture of this application therefore is identical to the similar motion of Robert L. Donovan.' Both applications were filed in the District Court under the docket number of the original criminal case.\n\n\n5\nIn view of this treatment of the motions by the parties and the trial court, the Court of Appeals was asked to consider the motions also as filed in the original criminal cases under Rule 35, and to hold that the trial court's rulings could not be appealed by the Government because they did not come within the limited purview of the Criminal Appeals Act.5 This reasoning the Court of Appeals declined to adopt, treating the motions instead as having been brought under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\n\n\n6\nThe court was correct in regarding Hill v. United States, supra, as requiring this view, in the case of a prisoner in custody under the sentence he is attacking. Cf. United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248. And in this area of the law, as the Court of Appeals pointed out, 'adjudication upon the underlying merits of claims is not hampered by reliance upon the titles petitioners put upon their documents.' 301 F.2d, at 378. See Heflin v. United States, 358 U.S. 415, 79 S.Ct. 451, 3 L.Ed.2d 407. Section 2255 explicitly authorizes a prisoner in custody under a sentence imposed by a federal court to attack such a sentence collaterally upon the ground that the sentence 'was imposed in violation of the * * * laws of the United States,' by moving the trial court 'to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.'6\n\n\n7\nAn action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is a separate proceeding, independent of the original criminal case. United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232. The Criminal Appeals Act has no applicability to such a proceeding. Instead, \u00a7 2255 itself provides that 'An appeal may be taken to the court of appeals from the order entered on the motion as from a final judgment on application for a writ of habeas corpus.' We cannot agree with the Court of Appeals, however, that under this provision the Government had a right to take appeals at the time it sought to do so in these cases, because we think it clear that the orders were interlocutory, not final. For a federal prisoner \u00a7 2255 can perform the full service of habeas corpus, by effecting the immediate and unconditional discharge of the prisoner. Sanders v. United States, 372 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068 (1963). But the provisions of the statute make clear that in appropriate cases a \u00a7 2255 proceeding can also be utilized to provide a more flexible remedy. In the present cases neither of the petitioners ever asked for his unconditional release. What they asked, and were granted, was the vacation of the sentences they were serving so that they might be returned to the trial court to be resentenced in proceedings in which their right to allocution would be accorded them. Such a remedy is precisely authorized by the statute. Under \u00a7 2255 a petitioner may 'move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.'7 And in response to such a motion a District Court is expressly authorized to 'discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.'8 Where, as here, what was appropriately asked and appropriately granted was the resentencing of the petitioners, it is obvious that there could be no final disposition of the \u00a7 2255 proceedings until the petitioners were resentenced. Cf. Parr v. United States, 351 U.S. 513, 518, 76 S.Ct. 912, 916, 100 L.Ed. 1377.\n\n\n8\nThe long-established rule against piecemeal appeals in federal cases and the overriding policy considerations upon which that rule is founded have been repeatedly emphasized by this Court. See, e.g., DiBella v. United States, 369 U.S. 121, 82 S.Ct. 654, 7 L.Ed.2d 614; Carroll v. United States, 354 U.S. 394, 77 S.Ct. 1332, 1 L.Ed.2d 1442; Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.S. 323, 60 S.Ct. 540, 84 L.Ed. 783. The standards of finality to which the Court has adhered in habeas corpus proceedings have been no less exacting. See, e.g., Collins v. Miller, 252 U.S. 364, 40 S.Ct. 347, 64 L.Ed. 616. There the Court said that the rule as to finality 'requires that the judgment to be appealable should be final not only as to all the parties, but as to the whole subject-matter and as to all the causes of action involved.' 252 U.S., at 370, 40 S.Ct. at 349.\n\n\n9\nThe basic reason for the rule against piecemeal interlocutory appeals in the federal system is particularly apparent in the cases before us. Until the petitioners are resentenced, it is impossible to know whether the Government will be able to show any colorable claim of prejudicial error. The District Court may, as before, sentence the petitioners to the same 25 years' imprisonment; it may place one or both of them on probation; it may make some other disposition with respect to their sentences. But until the court acts, none of the parties to this controversy will have had a final adjudication of his claims by the trial court in these \u00a7 2255 proceedings.\n\n\n10\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is set aside, and the cases are remanded to the District Court for the Southern District of New York for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n\n\n11\nJudgment Court of Appeals set aside and cases remanded to the District Court with directions.\n\n\n\n1\n No sentence was imposed on Count 1, because the court concluded that the conviction under this court had merged with the conviction under Count 2.\n\n\n2\n 'Whoever assaults any person having lawful charge, control, or custody of any mail matter or of any money or other property of the United States, with intent to rob, steal, or purloin such mail matter, money, or other property of the United States, or robs any such person of mail matter, or of any money, or other property of the United States, shall, for the first offense, be imprisoned not more than ten years; and if in effecting or attempting to effect such robbery he wounds the person having custody of such mail, money, or other property of the United States, or puts his life in jeopardy by the use of a dangerous weapon, or for a subsequent offense, shall be imprisoned twenty-five years.' 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2114.\n\n\n3\n Rule 32(a), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, provides in pertinent part as follows: 'Before imposing sentence the court shall afford the defendant an opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf and to present any information in mitigation of punishment.'\n\n\n4\n Rule 35 provides in pertinent part as follows: 'The court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.'\n\n\n5\n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731. The Government makes no claim of a right to appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act. No question as to the availability of a writ of mandamus is presented by this case. See United States v. Smith, 331 U.S. 469, 67 S.Ct. 1330, 91 L.Ed. 1610. Cf. United States v. Mayer, 235 U.S. 55, 35 S.Ct. 16, 59 L.Ed. 129.\n\n\n6\n The first paragraph of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 provides:\n'A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.'\n\n\n7\n See note 6, supra.\n\n\n8\n The third paragraph of \u00a7 2255 provides: 'Unless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the United States attorney, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto. If the court finds that the judgment was rendered without jurisdiction, or that the sentence imposed was not authorized by law or otherwise open to collateral attack, or that there has been such a denial or infringement of the constitutional rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment vulnerable to collateral attack, the court shall vacate and set the judgment aside and shall discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.'\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"410 U.S. 1\n93 S.Ct. 764\n35 L.Ed.2d 67\nUNITED STATES, Petitioner,v.Antonio DIONISIO.\nNo. 71\u2014229.\nArgued Nov. 6, 1972.\nDecided Jan. 22, 1973.\n\nSyllabus\nA grand jury subpoenaed about 20 persons, including respondent, to give voice exemplars for identification purposes. Respondent, on Fourth and Fifth Amendment grounds, refused to comply. The District Court rejected both claims and adjudged respondent in contempt. The Court of Appeals agreed in rejecting respondent's Fifth Amendment claim but reversed on the ground that the Fourth Amendment required a preliminary showing of reasonableness before a grand jury witness could be compelled to furnish a voice exemplar and that here the proposed 'seizures' would be unreasonable because of the large number of witnesses subpoenaed to produce the exemplars. Held:\n1. The compelled production of the voice exemplars would not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, since they were to be used only for identification purposes, and not for the testimonial or communicative content of the utterances. Pp. 5\u20147.\n2. Respondent's Fourth Amendment claim is also invalid. Pp. 8 18.\n(a) A subpoena to compel a person to appear before a grand jury does not constitute a 'seizure' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and the fact that many others besides respondent were ordered to give voice recordings did not render the subpoena unconstitutional. Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721, 89 S.Ct. 1394, 22 L.Ed.2d 676, distinguished. Pp. 8\u201413.\n(b) The grand jury's directive to make the voice recording infringed no valid Fourth Amendment interest. Pp. 13\u201415.\n(c) Since neither the summons to appear before the grand jury, nor its directive to give a voice exemplar contravened the Fourth Amendment, the Court of Appeals erred in requiring a preliminary showing of reasonableness before respondent could be compelled to furnish the exemplar. Pp. 15\u201416.\n442 F.2d 276, reversed and remanded.\nPhilip A. Lacovara, New York City, for petitioner.\nJohn Powers Crowley, Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\nMr. Justice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nA special grand jury was convened in the Northern District of Illinois in February 1971, to investigate possible violations of federal criminal statutes relating to gambling. In the course of its investigation, the grand jury received in evidence certain voice recordings that had been obtained pursuant to court orders.1\n\n\n2\nThe grand jury subpoenaed approximately 20 persons, including the respondent Dionisio, seeking to obtain from them voice exemplars for comparison with the recorded conversations that had been received in evidence. Each witness was advised that he was a potential defendant in a criminal prosecution. Each was asked to examine a transcript of an intercepted conversation, and to go to a nearby office of the United States Attorney to read the transcript into a recording device. The witnesses were advised that they would be allowed to have their attorneys present when they read the transcripts. Dionisio and other witnesses refused to furnish the voice exemplars, asserting that these disclosures would violate their rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.\n\n\n3\nThe Government then filed separate petitions in the United States District Court to compel Dionisio and the other witnesses to furnish the voice exemplars to the grand jury. The petitions stated that the exemplars were 'essential and necessary' to the grand jury investigation, and that they would 'be used solely as a standard of comparison in order to determine whether or not the witness is the person whose voice was intercepted . . ..'\n\n\n4\nFollowing a hearing, the District Judge rejected the witnesses' constitutional arguments and ordered them to comply with the grand jury's request. He reasoned that voice exemplars, like handwriting exemplars or fingerprints, were not testimonial or communicative evidence, and that consequently the order to produce them would not compel any witness to testify against himself. The District Judge also found that there would be no Fourth Amendment violation, because the grand jury subpoena did not itself violate the Fourth Amendment, and the order to produce the voice exemplars would involve no unreasonable search and seizure within the proscription of that Amendment:\n\n\n5\n'The witnesses are lawfully before the grand jury pursuant to      subpoena. The Fourth Amendment prohibition against      unreasonable search and seizure applies only where      identifying physical characteristics, such as fingerprints,      are obtained as a result of unlawful detention of a suspect,      or when an intrusion into the body, such as a blood test, is      undertaken without a warrant, absent an emergency situation.      E.g., Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721, 724\u2014728 (89 S.Ct.      1394, 1396\u20141398, 22 L.Ed.2d 676;) (1969); Schmerber v.      California, 384 U.S. 757, 770\u2014771 (86 S.Ct. 1826, 1835\u20141836,      16 L.Ed.2d 908.) (1966).'2\n\n\n6\nWhen Dionisio persisted in his refusal to respond to the grand jury's directive, the District Court adjudged him in civil contempt and ordered him committed to custody until he obeyed the court order, or until the expiration of 18 months.3\n\n\n7\nThe Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. 442 F.2d 276. It agreed with the District Court in rejecting the Fifth Amendment claims,4 but concluded that to compel the voice recordings would violate the Fourth Amendment. In the court's view, the grand jury was 'seeking to obtain the voice exemplars of the witnesses by the use of its subpoena powers because probable cause did not exist for their arrest or for some other, less unusual, method of compelling the production of the exemplars.' Id., at 280. The court found that the Fourth Amendment applied to grand jury process, and that 'under the fourth amendment law enforcement officials may not compel the production of physical evidence absent a showing of the reasonableness of the seizure. Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721, 89 S.Ct. 1394, 22 L.Ed.2d 676 . . ..' Ibid.\n\n\n8\nIn Davis this Court held that it was error to admit the petitioner's fingerprints into evidence at his trial for rape, because they had been obtained during a police detention following a lawless wholesale roundup of the petitioner and more than 20 other youths. Equating the procedures followed by the grand jury in the present case to the fingerprint detentions in Davis, the Court of Appeals reasoned that '(t)he dragnet effect here, where approximately twenty persons were subpoenaed for purposes of identification, has the same invidious effect on fourth amendment rights as the practice condemned in Davis.' Id., at 281.\n\n\n9\nIn view of a clear conflict between this decision and one in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,5 we granted the Government's petition for certiorari. 406 U.S. 956, 92 S.Ct. 2056, 32 L.Ed.2d 343.\n\n\n10\n* The Court of Appeals correctly rejected the contention that the compelled production of the voice exemplars would violate the Fifth Amendment. It has long been held that the compelled display of identifiable physical characteristics infringes no interest protected by the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. In Holt v. United States, 218 U.S. 245, 252, 31 S.Ct. 2, 6, 54 L.Ed. 1021, Mr. Justice Holmes, writing for the Court, dismissed as an 'extravagant extension of the Fifth Amendment' the argument that it violated the privilege to require a defendant to put on a blouse for identification purposes. He explained that 'the prohibition of compelling a man in a criminal court to be witness against himself is a prohibition of the use of physical or moral compulsion to extort communications from him, not an exclusion of his body as evidence when it may be material.' Id., at 252\u2014253, 31 S.Ct., at 6.\n\n\n11\nMore recently, in Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908, we relied on Holt, and noted that:\n\n\n12\n'(B)oth federal and state courts have usually held that (the      privilege) it offers no protection against compulsion to      submit to fingerprinting, photographing, or measurements, to      write or speak for identification, to appear in court, to      stand, to assume a stance, to walk, or to make a particular      gesture. The distinction which has emerged, often expressed      in different ways, is that the privilege is a bar against      compelling 'communications' or 'testimony,' but that      compulsion which makes a suspect or accused the source of      'real or physical evidence' does not violate it.' Id., at      764, 86 S.Ct., at 1832 (footnote omitted).\n\n\n13\nThe Court held that the extraction and chemical analysis of a blood sample involved no 'shadow of testimonial compulsion upon or enforced communication by the accused.' Id., at 765, 86 S.Ct., at 1832.\n\n\n14\nThese cases led us to conclude in Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178, that handwriting exemplars were not protected by the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. While '(o)ne's voice and handwriting are, of course, means of communication,' we held that a 'mere handwriting exemplar, in contrast to the content of what is written, like the voice or body itself, is an identifying physical characteristic outside its protection.' Id., at 266\u2014267, 87 S.Ct., at 1953. And similarly in United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149, we found no error in compelling a defendant accused of bank robbery to utter in a lineup words that had allegedly been spoken by the robber. The accused there was 'required to use his voice as an identifying physical characteristic, not to speak his guilt.' Id., at 222\u2014223, 87 S.Ct., at 1930.\n\n\n15\nWade and Gilbert definitively refute any contention that the compelled production of the voice exemplars in this case would violate the Fifth Amendment. The voice recordings were to be used solely to measure the physical properties of the witnesses' voices, not for the testimonial or communicative content of what was to be said.6\n\nII\n\n16\nThe Court of Appeals held that the Fourth Amendment required a preliminary showing of reasonableness before a grand jury witness could be compelled to furnish a voice exemplar, and that in this case the proposed 'seizures' of the voice exemplars would be unreasonable because of the large number of witnesses summoned by the grand jury and directed to produce such exemplars. We disagree.\n\n\n17\nThe Fourth Amendment guarantees that all people shall be 'secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures . . ..' Any Fourth Amendment violation in the present setting must rest on a lawless governmental intrusion upon the privacy of 'persons' rather than on interference with 'property relationships or private papers.' Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S., at 767, 86 S.Ct., at 1833; see United States v. Doe (Schwartz), 2 Cir., 457 F.2d 895, 897. In Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, the Court explained the protection afforded to 'persons' in terms of the statement in Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576, that 'the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places,' id., at 351, 88 S.Ct., at 511, and concluded that 'wherever an individual may harbor a reasonable 'expectation of privacy,' . . . he is entitled to be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.' Terry v. Ohio, supra, 392 U.S., at 9, 88 S.Ct., at 1873.\n\n\n18\nAs the Court made clear in Schmerber, supra, the obtaining of physical evidence from a person involves a potential Fourth Amendment violation at two different levels\u2014the 'seizure' of the 'person' necessary to bring him into contact with government agents, see Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721, 89 S.Ct. 1394, 22 L.Ed.2d 676, and the subsequent search for and seizure of the evidence. In Schmerber, we found the initial seizure of the accused justified as a lawful arrest, and the subsequent seizure of the blood sample from his body reasonable in light of the exigent circumstances. And in Terry, we concluded that neither the initial seizure of the person, an investigatory 'stop' by a policeman, nor the subsequent search, a 'patdown' of his outer clothing for weapons, constituted a violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The constitutionality of the compulsory production of exemplars from a grand jury witness necessarily turns on the same dual inquiry\u2014whether either the initial compulsion of the person to appear before the grand jury, or the subsequent directive to make a voice recording is an unreasonable 'seizure' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n\n19\nIt is clear that a subpoena to appear before a grand jury is not a 'seizure' in the Fourth Amendment sense, even though that summons may be inconvenient or burdensome. Last Term we again acknowledged what has long been recognized,7 that '(c)itizens generally are not constitutionally immune from grand jury subpoenas . . ..' Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 682, 92 S.Ct. 1646, 2656, 33 L.Ed.2d 626. We concluded that:\n\n\n20\n'Although the powers of the grand jury are not unlimited and      are subject to the supervision of a judge, the longstanding      principle that 'the public . . . has a right to every man's      evidence,' except for those persons protected by a      constitutional, commonlaw, or statutory privilege, United      States v. Bryan, 339 U.S. 323, 331, 70 S.Ct. 724, 730, 94      L.Ed. 884 (1950); Blackmer v. United States, 284 U.S. 421,      438, 52 S.Ct. 252, 255, 76 L.Ed. 375 (1932); 8 J. Wigmore,      Evidence \u00a7 2192 (McNaughton rev. 1961), is particularly      applicable to grand jury proceedings.' Id., at 688, 92 S.Ct.,      at 2660.\n\n\n21\nThese are recent reaffirmations of the historically grounded obligation of every person to appear and give his evidence before the grand jury. 'The personal sacrifice involved is a part of the necessary contribution of the individual to the welfare of the public.' Blair v. United States, 250 U.S. 273, 281, 39 S.Ct. 468, 471, 63 L.Ed. 979. See also Garland v. Torre, 2 Cir., 259 F.2d 545, 549. And while the duty may be 'onerous' at times, it is 'necessary to the administration of justice.' Blair v. United States, supra, at 281, 39 S.Ct., at 471.8\n\n\n22\nThe compulsion exerted by a grand jury subpoena differs from the seizure effected by an arrest or even an investigative 'stop' in more than civic obligation. For, as Judge Friendly wrote for the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit:\n\n\n23\n'The latter is abrupt, is effected with force or the threat      of it and often in demeaning circumstances, and, in the case      of arrest, results in a record involving social stigma. A      subpoena is served in the same manner as other legal process;      it involves no stigma whatever; if the time for appearance is      inconvenient, this can generally be altered; and it remains      at all times under the control and supervision of a court.'      United States v. Doe (Schwartz) 457 F.2d, at 898.\n\n\n24\nThus the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit correctly recognized in a case subsequent to the one now before us, that a 'grand jury subpoena to testify is not that kind of governmental intrusion on privacy against which the Fourth Amendment affords protection once the Fifth Amendment is satisfied.' Fraser v. United States, 452 F.2d 616, 620; cf. United States v. Weinberg, 9 Cir., 439 F.2d 743, 748\u2014749.\n\n\n25\nThis case is thus quite different from Davis v. Mississippi, supra, on which the Court of Appeals primarily relied. For in Davis it was the initial seizure\u2014the lawless dragnet detention that violated the Fourth and Fouteenth Amendments, not the taking of the fingerprints. We noted that '(i)nvestigatory seizures would subject unlimited numbers of innocent persons to the harassment and ignominy incident to involuntary detention,' 394 U.S., at 726, 89 S.Ct., at 1397, and we left open the question whether, consistently with the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, narrowly circumscribed procedures might be developed for obtaining fingerprints from people when there was no probable cause to arrest them. Id., at 728, 89 S.Ct., at 1398.9 Davis is plainly inapposite to a case where the initial restraint does not itself infringe the Fourth Amendment.\n\n\n26\nThis is not to say that a grand jury subpoena is some talisman that dissolves all constitutional protections. The grand jury cannot require a witness to testify against himself. It cannot require the production by a person of private books and records that would incriminate him. See Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 633\u2014635, 6 S.Ct. 524, 533\u2014535, 29 L.Ed. 746.10 The Fourth Amendment provides protection against a grand jury subpoena duces tecum too sweeping in its terms 'to be regarded as reasonable.' Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 76, 26 S.Ct. 370, 379, 50 L.Ed. 652; cf. Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, 327 U.S. 186, 208, 217, 66 S.Ct. 494, 505, 509, 90 L.Ed. 614. And last Term, in the context of a First Amendment claim, we indicated that the Constitution could not tolerate the transformation of the grand jury into an instrument of oppression: 'Official harassment of the press undertaken not for purposes of law enforcement but to disrupt a reporter's relationship with his news sources would have no justification. Grand juries are subject to judicial control and subpoenas to motions to quash. We do not expect courts will forget that grand juries must operate within the limits of the First Amendment as well as the Fifth.' Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S., at 707\u2014708, 92 S.Ct., at 2669\u20142670. See also, id., at 710, 92 S.Ct., at 2671 (Powell, J., concurring).\n\n\n27\nBut we are here faced with no such constitutional infirmities in the subpoena to appear before the grand jury or in the order to make the voice recordings. There is, as we have said, no valid Fifth Amendment claim. There was no order to produce private books and papers, and no sweeping subpoena duces tecum. And even if Branzburg be extended beyond its First Amendment moorings and tied to a more generalized due process concept, there is still no indication in this case of the kind of harassment that was of concern there.\n\n\n28\nThe Court of Appeals found critical significance in the fact that the grand jury had summoned approximately 20 witnesses to furnish voice exemplars.11 We think that fact is basically irrelevant to the constitutional issues here. The grand jury may have been attempting to identify a number of voices on the tapes in evidence, or it might have summoned the 20 witnesses in an effort to identify one voice. But whatever the case, '(a) grand jury's investigation is not fully carried out until every available clue has been run down and all witnesses examined in every proper way to find if a crime has been committed . . ..' United States v. Stone, 2 Cir., 429 F.2d 138, 140. See also Wood v. Georgia, 370 U.S. 375, 392, 82 S.Ct. 1364, 1374, 8 L.Ed.2d 569. As the Court recalled last Term, 'Because its task is to inquire into the existence of possible criminal conduct and to return only well-founded indictments, its investigative powers are necessarily broad.' Branzburg v. Hayes, supra, 408 U.S., at 688, 92 S.Ct., at 2659.12 The grand jury may well find it desirable to call numerous witnesses in the course of an investigation. It does not follow that each witness may resist a subpoena on the ground that too many witnesses have been called. Neither the order to Dionisio to appear nor the order to make a voice recording was rendered unreasonable by the fact that many others were subjected to the same compulsion.\n\n\n29\nBut the conclusion that Dionisio's compulsory appearance before the grand jury was not an unreasonable 'seizure' is the answer to only the first part of the Fourth Amendment inquiry here. Dionisio argues that the grand jury's subsequent directive to make the voice recording was itself an infringement of his rights under the Fourth Amendment. We cannot accept that argument.\n\n\n30\nIn Katz v. United States, supra, we said that the Fourth Amendment provides no protection for what 'a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office . . ..' 389 U.S., at 351, 88 S.Ct., at 511. The physical characteristics of a person's voice, its tone and manner, as opposed to the content of a specific conversation, are constantly exposed to the public. Like a man's facial characteristics, or handwriting, his voice is repeatedly produced for others to hear. No person can have a reasonable expectation that others will not know the sound of his voice, any more than he can reasonably expect that his face will be a mystery to the world. As the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stated:\n\n\n31\n'Except for the rare recluse who chooses to live his life in      complete solitude, in our daily lives we constantly speak and      write, and while the content of a communication is entitled      to Fourth Amendment protection . . . the underlying      identifying characteristics\u2014the constant factor throughout      both public and private communications\u2014are open for all to      see or hear. There is no basis for constructing a wall of      privacy against the grand jury which does not exist in casual      contacts with strangers. Hence no intrusion into an      individual's privacy results from compelled execution of      handwriting or voice exemplars; nothing is being exposed to      the grand jury that has not previously been exposed to the      public at large.' United States v. Doe (Schwartz), 2 Cir.,      457 F.2d, at 898\u2014899.\n\n\n32\nThe required disclosure of a person's voice is thus immeasurably further removed from the Fourth Amendment protection than was the intrusion into the body effected by the blood extraction in Schmerber. 'The interests in human dignity and privacy which the Fourth Amendment protects forbid any such intrusions on the mere chance that desired evidence might be obtained.' Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S., at 769\u2014770, 86 S.Ct., at 1835. Similarly, a seizure of voice exemplars does not involve the 'severe, though brief, intrusion upon cherished personal security,' effected by the 'pat down' in Terry\u2014'surely . . . an annoying, frightening, and perhaps humiliating experience.' Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S., at 24\u201425, 88 S.Ct., at 1882. Rather, this is like the fingerprinting in Davis, where, though the initial dragnet detentions were constitutionally impermissible, we noted that the fingerprinting itself 'involves none of the probing into an individual's private life and thoughts that marks an interrogation or search.' Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U.S., at 727, 89 S.Ct., at 1398; cf. Thom v. New York Stock Exchange, D.C., 306 F.Supp. 1002, 1009.\n\n\n33\nSince neither the summons to appear before the grand jury nor its directive to make a voice recording infringed upon any interest protected by the Fourth Amendment, there was no justification for requiring the grand jury to satisfy even the minimal requirement of 'reasonableness' imposed by the Court of Appeals.13 See United States v. Doe (Schwartz), supra, 457 F.2d, at 899\u2014900. A grand jury has broad investigative powers to determine whether a crime has been committed and who has committed it. The jurors may act on tips, rumors, evidence offered by the prosecutor, or their own personal knowledge. Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S., at 701, 92 S.Ct., at 2666. No grand jury witness is 'entitled to set limits to the investigation that the grand jury may conduct.' Blair v. United States, 250 U.S., at 282, 39 S.Ct., at 471. And a sufficient basis for an indictment may only emerge at the end of the investigation when all the evidence has been received.\n\n\n34\n'It is impossible to conceive that . . . the examination of      witnesses must be stopped until a basis is laid by an      indictment formally preferred, when the very object of the      examination is to ascertain who shall be indicted.' Hale v.      Henkel, 201 U.S., at 65, 26 S.Ct., at 375.\n\n\n35\nSince Dionisio raised no valid Fourth Amendment claim, there is no more reason to require a preliminary showing of reasonableness here than there would be in the case of any witness who, despite the lack of any constitutional or statutory privilege, declined to answer a question or comply with a grand jury request. Neither the Constitution nor our prior cases justify any such interference with grand jury proceedings.14\n\n\n36\nThe Fifth Amendment guarantees that no civilian may be brought to trial for an infamous crime 'unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury.' This constitutional guarantee presupposes an investigative body 'acting independently of either prosecuting attorney or judge,' Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212, 218, 80 S.Ct. 270, 273, 4 L.Ed.2d 252, whose mission is to clear the innocent, no less than to bring to trial those who may be guilty.15 Any holding that would saddle a grand jury with minitrials and preliminary showings would assuredly impede its investigation and frustrate the public's interest in the fair and expeditious administration of the criminal laws. Cf. United States v. Ryan, 402 U.S. 530, 532 533, 91 S.Ct. 1580, 1581\u20141582, 29 L.Ed.2d 85; Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 363\u2014364, 76 S.Ct. 406, 408\u2014409, 100 L.Ed. 397; Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.S. 323, 327\u2014328.16 60 S.Ct. 540, 542\u2014543, 84 L.Ed. 783. The grand jury may not always serve its historic role as a protective bulwark standing solidly between the ordinary citizen and an overzealous prosecutor, but if it is even to approach the proper performance of its constitutional mission, it must be free to pursue its investigations unhindered by external influence or supervision so long as it does not trench upon the legitimate rights of any witness called before it.\n\n\n37\nSince the Court of Appeals found an unreasonable search and seizure where none existed, and imposed a preliminary showing of reasonableness where none was required, its judgment is reversed and this case is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n38\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n39\nJudgment reversed and case remanded.\n\n\n\n1\n The court orders were issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518, a statute authorizing the interception of wire communications upon a judicial determination that '(a) there is probable cause for belief that an individual is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a particular offense enumerated in section 2516 of this chapter (including the transmission of wagering information); (b) there is probable cause for belief that particular communications concerning that offense will be obtained through such interception; (c) normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous; (d) there is probable cause for belief that the facilities from which, or the place where, the wire or oral communications are to be intercepted are being used, or are about to be used, in connection with the commission of such offense, or are leased to, listed in the name of, or commonly used by such person.'\n\n\n2\n The decision of the District Court is unreported.\n\n\n3\n The life of the special grand jury was 18 months, but could be extended up to an additional 18 months. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3331.\n\n\n4\n The court also rejected the argument that the grand jury procedure violated the witnesses' Sixth Amendment right to counsel. It found the contention particularly without merit in view of the option afforded the witnesses to have their attorneys present while they made the voice recordings. 442 F.2d 276, 278.\n\n\n5\n United States v. Doe (Schwartz), 2 Cir., 457 F.2d 895 (affirming civil contempt judgment against grand jury witness for refusal to furnish handwriting exemplars).\n\n\n6\n The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit appears to have recanted somewhat from its clear and correct holding in the present case that the compelled production of voice exemplars would not violate the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. In subsequently explaining that holding, the Court qualified it:\n'Nevertheless, the witnesses were potential defendants, and since the purpose of the voice exemplars was to identify the voices obtained by FBI agents pursuant to a court-ordered wiretap, the self-incriminatory impact of the compelled exemplars was clear. Thus the compelled exemplars were at odds with the spirit of the Fifth Amendment. Because the Fifth Amendment illuminates the Fourth (see . . . Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746 . . .), the Fourth Amendment violation appears more readily than where immunity is granted, and in Dionisio immunity had not yet been granted.' Fraser v. United States, 7 Cir., 452 F.2d 616, 619 n. 5.\nBut Boyd dealt with the compulsory production of private books and records, testimonial sources, a circumstance in which the 'Fourth and Fifth Amendments run almost into each other.' 116 U.S., at 630, 6 S.Ct., at 532. In the present case, by contrast, no Fifth Amendment interests are jeopardized; there is no hint of testimonial compulsion. The Court of Appeals' subsequent attempt to read the 'spirit of the Fifth Amendment' into the production of voice exemplars cannot survive comparison with Wade, Gilbert, and Schmerber.\n\n\n7\n See generally Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 443 444, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 1655\u20141656, 32 L.Ed.2d 212; Blair v. United States, 250 U.S. 273, 279\u2014281, 39 S.Ct. 468, 470\u2014471, 63 L.Ed. 979; 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2191 (J. McNaughton rev. 1961).\n\n\n8\n The obligation to appear is no different for a person who may himself be the subject of the grand jury inquiry. See United States v. Doe (Schwartz), 2 Cir., 457 F.2d, at 898; United States v. Winter, 2 Cir., 348 F.2d 204, 207\u2014208.\n\n\n9\n Judge Weinfeld correctly characterized Davis as 'but another application of the principle that the Fourth Amendment applies to all searches and seizures of the person no matter what the scope or duration. It held that in the circumstances there presented the detention for the sole purpose of fingerprinting was in violation of the Fourth Amendment ban against unreasonable search and seizure.' Thom v. New York Stock Exchange, D.C., 306 F.Supp. 1002, 1007 (footnote omitted). See also Allen v. Cupp, 9 Cir., 426 F.2d 756, 760.\n\n\n10\n While Boyd was concerned with a motion to produce invoices at a forfeiture trial, the Court treated it as the equivalent of a subpoena duces tecum, and Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 76, 26 S.Ct. 370, 379, 50 L.Ed. 652, applied Boyd in the context of a grand jury subpoena.\n\n\n11\n As noted above, supra, at 11, there is no valid comparison between the detentions of the 24 youths in Davis, and the grand jury subpoenas of the witnesses here. While the dragnet detentions by the police did constitute substantial intrusions into the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of each of the youths in Davis, no person has a justifiable expectation of immunity from a grand jury subpoena.\n\n\n12\n '(The grand jury) is a grand inquest, a body with powers of investigation and inquisition, the scope of whose inquiries is not to be limited narrowly by questions of propriety or forecasts of the probable result of the investigation, or by doubts whether any particular individual will be found properly subject to an accusation of crime. As has been said before, the identity of the offender, and the precise nature of the offense, if there be one, normally are developed at the conclusion of the grand jury's labors, not at the beginning. Hendricks v. United States, 223 U.S. 178, 184, 32 S.Ct. 313, 56 L.Ed. 394.' Blair v. United States, 250 U.S., at 282, 39 S.Ct., at 471.\n\n\n13\n In Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S., at 77, 26 S.Ct., at 380, the Court found that such a standard had not been met, but as noted supra, at 11\u201412, that was a case where the Fourth Amendment had been infringed by an overly broad subpoena to produce books and papers.\n\n\n14\n Mr. Justice MARSHALL, in dissent 410 U.S. 31, 93 S.Ct. 781, suggests that a preliminary showing of 'reasonableness' is required where the grand jury subpoenas a witness to appear and produce handwriting or voice exemplars, but not when it subpoenas him to appear and testify. Such a distinction finds no support in the Constitution. His dissent argues that there is a potential Fourth Amendment violation in the case of a subpoenaed grand jury witness because of the asserted intrusiveness of the initial subpoena to appear\u2014the possible stigma from a grand jury appearance and the inconvenience of the official restraint. But the initial directive to appear is as intrusive if the witness is called simply to testify as it is if he is summoned to produce physical evidence.\n\n\n15\n '(T)he institution was adopted in this country, and is continued from considerations similar to those which give to it its chief value in England, and is designed as a means, not only of bringing to trial persons accused of public offences upon just grounds, but also as a means of protecting the citizen against unfounded accusation, whether it comes from government, or be prompted by partisan passion or private enmity. No person shall be required, according to the fundamental law of the country, except in the cases mentioned, to answer for any of the higher crimes unless this body, consisting of not less than sixteen nor more than twenty-three good and lawful men, selected from the body of the district, shall declare, upon careful deliberation, under the solemnity of an oath, that there is good reason for his accusation and trial.' Ex parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1, 11, 7 S.Ct. 781, 786, 30 L.Ed. 849 (quoting grand jury charge of Mr. Justice Field). See also Wood v. Georgia, 370 U.S. 375, 390, 82 S.Ct. 1364, 1373, 8 L.Ed.2d 569.\n\n\n16\n The possibilities for delay caused by requiring initial showings of 'reasonableness' are illustrated by the Court of Appeals' subsequent decision in In re September 1971 Grand Jury, 7 Cir., 454 F.2d 580, rev'd sub nom. United States v. Mara, 410 U.S. 19, 93 S.Ct. 774, 35 L.Ed.2d 99, where the Court held that the Government was required to show in an adversary hearing that its request for exemplars was reasonable, and 'reasonableness' included proof that the exemplars could not be obtained from other sources.\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"429 U.S. 413\n97 S.Ct. 658\n50 L.Ed.2d 652\nUNITED STATES, Petitioner,v.Thomas W. DONOVAN et al.\nNo. 75-212.\nArgued Oct. 13, 1976.\nDecided Jan. 18, 1977.\n\nSyllabus\nTitle 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(1)(b)(iv), which is part of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, requires the Government to include in its wiretap applications \"the identity of the person, if known, committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted.\" Section 2518(8) (d) requires the judge to whom a wiretap application is made to cause to be served on the persons named in the wiretap order or application an inventory, which must give notice of entry of the order or application, state the disposition of the application, and indicate whether communications were intercepted, and further provides that the judge may order similar notice to other parties to intercepted communications if he concludes that such action is in the interest of justice. Evidence derived from wiretaps must be suppressed under \u00a7 2518(10)(a)(i) if \"the communication was unlawfully intercepted.\" On December 26, 1972, the Government applied for an extension of an order authorizing a wiretap interception of gambling-related conversations of certain named individuals other than respondents Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzacco and \"others as yet unknown\" to or from four listed telephones, and the Government did not identify these respondents in the application even though it had previously learned they were discussing illegal gambling activities with the named subjects. The District Court authorized a 15-day interception. On February 21, 1973, the Government submitted to the court a proposed order giving notice of the interception to 37 persons, the court signed the order, and an inventory notice was served on the listed persons, including respondents Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzacco. Subsequently, after the Government submitted the names of two additional persons whose identities allegedly had been omitted inadvertently from the initial list, the court entered an amended order giving notice to those individuals, but as a result of \"administrative oversight\" respondents Merlo and Lauer were not included in either list of names and were never served with an inventory notice. Respondents, along with others, were indicted for federal gambling offenses. On respondents' motion, the District Court suppressed as to respondents Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzacco all evidence derived from the December 26 intercept order on the ground that failure to name them in the application and order of that date violated \u00a7 2518(1)(b)(iv), inter alia, and suppressed at to respondents Merlo and Lauer all evidence derived from both intercept orders on the ground that these two respondents had not been served with an inventory notice as required by \u00a7 2518(8)(d). The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held :\n1. Section 2518(1)(b)(iv) is not satisfied when the wiretap application identifies only the \"principal target\" (usually the individual whose phone is monitored) of the interception, but the Government is required to name all individuals who it has probable cause to believe are engaged in the criminal activity under investigation and whose conversations it expects will be intercepted over the target telephone. Neither the language and structure of Title III nor its legislative history supports the interpretation that Congress intended to remove from the identification requirement those suspects whose intercepted communications originated on a telephone other than that listed in the wiretap application. Pp. 423-428.\n2. Under \u00a7 2518(8)(d), the Government has a statutory responsibility to inform the issuing judge of the identities of persons whose conversations were overheard in the course of the interception, thus enabling him to decide whether they should be served with notice of the interception. Here the Government did not comply adequately with \u00a7 2518(8)(d), since the names of respondents Merlo and Lauer were not included on the purportedly complete list of identifiable persons submitted to the issuing judge. Pp. 428-432.\n3. Although the Government was required under \u00a7 2518(1)(b)(iv) to identify respondents Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzacco in the December 26 application, failure to do so under these circumstances did not warrant suppression under \u00a7 2518(10)(a)(i), since the identification in an intercept application of all those likely to be overheard in incriminating conversations does not play a \"substantive role\" with respect to judicial authorization of intercept orders and hence does not impose a limitation on the use of intercept procedures. Pp. 435-437.\n(a) Here the statutorily imposed preconditions to judicial authorization (a determination that normal investigative techniques have failed or are unlikely to succeed, and probable cause to believe that (i) an individual is engaged in criminal activity, (ii) particular communications concerning the offense will be obtained through interception, and (iii) the target facilities are being used in connection with the specified criminal activity) were satisfied, and the issuing judge was simply unaware that additional persons might be overheard engaging in incriminating conversations, the intercept being lawful because the application provided sufficient information to enable the judge to determine that the statutory preconditions were satisfied. Pp. 435-436.\n(b) There is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that Congress intended \u00a7 2518(1)(b)(iv)'s broad identification requirement to play \"a central, or even functional, role in guarding against unwarranted use of wiretapping or electronic surveillance,\" United States v. Chavez, 416 U.S. 562, 578, 94 S.Ct. 1849, 1857, 40 L.Ed.2d 380. P. 437.\n4. Nor was suppression justified under \u00a7 2518(10)(a)(i) with respect to respondents Merlo and Lauer simply because the Government inadvertently omitted their names from the comprehensive list of all identifiable persons whose conversations had been overheard. Pp. 438-439.\n(a) There is nothing in the structure or legislative history of the Act to suggest that incriminating conversations are \"unlawfully intercepted\" whenever parties to those conversations do not receive discretionary inventory notice under \u00a7 2518(8)(d) as a result of the Government's failure to inform the court of their identities. P. 438.\n(b) Here, at the time inventory notice was served on the other identifiable persons, the intercept had been completed and the conversations had been \"seized\" under a valid intercept order, and the fact that discretionary notice reached 39 rather than 41 identifiable persons does not in itself mean that the conversations were unlawfully intercepted. Pp. 438-439.\n6 Cir., 513 F.2d 337, reversed and remanded.\nAndrew L. Frey, Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\nBernard A. Berkman, Cleveland, Ohio, and Carmen A. Policy, Youngstown, Ohio, for respondents.\nMr. Justice POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis case presents issues concerning the construction of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520. Specifically, we must decide whether 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(1)(b)(iv), which requires the Government to include in its wiretap applications \"the identity of the person, if known, committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted,\" is satisfied when the Government identifies only the \"principal targets\" of the intercept. Second, we must decide whether the Government has a statutory responsibility to inform the issuing judge of the identities of persons whose conversations were overheard in the course of the interception, thus enabling him to decide whether they should be served with notice of the interception pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(8)(d). And finally, we must determine whether failure to comply fully with these statutory provisions requires suppression of evidence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(10)(a).\n\n\n2\n* On November 28, 1972, a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation applied to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio for an order authorizing a wiretap interception in accordance with Title III.1 The application requested authorization to intercept gambling-related communications over two telephones at one address in North Olmstead, Ohio, and two other telephones at a home in Canton, Ohio. The accompanying affidavit recited that the telephones were being used by Albert Kotoch, Joseph Spaganlo, and George Florea to conduct an illegal gambling business, and that in conducting that business they would place calls to and receive calls from various persons, three of whom were also named in the wiretap application.2 The affiant also stated that the Government's informants would refuse to testify against the persons named in the application, that telephone records alone would be insufficient to support a gambling conviction, and that normal investigative techniques were unlikely to be fruitful. Pursuant to the Government's request, the District Court authorized for a period of 15 days the interception of gambling-related wire communications of Kotoch, Spaganlo, Florea, three named individuals other than the respondents, and \"others, as yet unknown,\" to and from the four listed telephones.3\n\n\n3\nDuring the course of the wiretap, the Government learned that respondents Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzacco were discussing illegal gambling activities with the named subjects. On December 26, 1972, the Government applied for an extension of the initial intercept order.4 This time it sought authorization to intercept gambling-related conversations of Kotoch, Spaganlo, Florea, two other named individuals, and \"others as yet unknown,\" but it did not identify respondents Donovan, Buzzacco and Robbins in this second application.5 The District Court again authorized interception of gambling-related conversations for a maximum of 15 days.\n\n\n4\nOn February 21, 1973, the Government submitted to the District Court a proposed order giving notice of the interceptions to 37 persons, a group which the Government apparently thought included all individuals who could be identified as having discussed gambling over the monitored telephones.6 The District Court signed the proposed order, and an inventory notice was served on the listed persons, including respondents Donovan, Buzzacco, and Robbins. On September 11, 1973, after the Government submitted the names of two additional persons whose identities allegedly had been omitted inadvertently from the initial list, the District Court entered an amended order giving notice to those individuals. As a result of what the Government labels \"administrative oversight,\" respondents Merlo and Lauer were not included in either list of names and were never served with inventory notice.7\n\n\n5\nOn November 1, 1973, an indictment was returned in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio charging Kotoch, Spaganlo, the five respondents, and 10 other individuals with conspiracy to conduct and conducting a gambling business in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 1955. The five respondents filed motions to suppress evidence derived from the wire interception. After an evidentiary hearing on the motions, the District Court suppressed as to respondents Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzacco all evidence derived from the December 26 intercept order on the ground that failure to identify them by name in the application and order of that date violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2518(1)(b)(iv) and 2518(4)(a). With respect to Merlo and Lauer, who were not known to the Government until after the December 26 application, the District Court suppressed all evidence derived from both intercept orders on the ground that they had not been served with inventory notice.\n\n\n6\nThe Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 513 F.2d 337 (1975).8 On the identification issue, the court held that the wiretap application must identify every person whose conversations relating to the subject criminal activity the Government has probable cause to believe it will intercept. Agreeing with the District Court that at the time of the December 26 application the Government had probable cause to believe that it would overhear Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzaco \"committing the offense,\" the Court of Appeals affirmed the suppression of evidence derived from the December 26 order. On the notice question, it held that the Government has an implied statutory duty to inform the issuing judge of the identities of the parties whose conversations were overheard so that he can determine whether discretionary inventory notice should be required.9 Because the Government had failed to perform this duty with respect to Merlo and Lauer, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's order suppressing evidence derived from both intercept orders. The court found it unnecessary to determine whether the failure to identify respondents Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzaco in the December 26 application and to name respondents Merlo and Lauer in the proposed inventory notice orders was inadvertent or purposeful, since the mere fact of omission was sufficient to require suppression under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(10)(a).10\n\n\n7\nWe granted certiorari to resolve these issues, which concern the construction of a major federal statute, 424 U.S. 907, 96 S.Ct. 1100, 47 L.Ed.2d 310, and now reverse.\n\nII\n\n8\nThe United States contends that \u00a7 2518(1)(b)(iv) requires that a wiretap application identify only the principal target of the interception, and that \u00a7 2518(8)(d) does not require the Government to provide the issuing judge with a list of all identifiable persons who were overheard in the course of an authorized interception. We think neither contention is sound.\n\nA.\n\n9\nWe turn first to the identification requirements of \u00a7 2518(1)(b)(iv). That provision requires a wiretap application to specify \"the identity of the person, if known, committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted.\" In construing that language, this Court already has ruled that the Government is not required to identify an individual in the application unless it has probable cause to believe (i) that the individual is engaged in the criminal activity under investigation and (ii) that the individual's conversations will be intercepted over the target telephone. United States v. Kahn, 415 U.S. 143, 94 S.Ct. 977, 39 L.Ed.2d 225 (1974). The question at issue here is whether the Government is required to name all such individuals.11\n\n\n10\nThe United States argues that the most reasonable interpretation of the plain language of the statute is that the application must identify only the principal target of the investigation, who \"will almost always be the individual whose phone is to be monitored.\"12 Brief for United States 18. Under this interpretation, if the Government has reason to believe that an individual will use the target telephone to place or receive calls, and the Government has probable cause to believe that the individual is engaged in the criminal activity under investigation, the individual qualifies as a principal target and must be named in the wiretap application. On the other hand, an individual who uses a different telephone to place calls to or receive calls from the target telephone is not a principal target even if the Government has probable cause to believe that the individual is engaged in the criminal activity under investigation. In other words, whether one is a principal target of the investigation depends on whether one operates the target telephone to place or receive calls.13\n\n\n11\nWhatever the merits of such a statutory scheme, we find little support for it in the language and structure of Title III or in the legislative history. The statutory language itself refers only to \"the person, if known, committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted.\" That description is as applicable to a suspect placing calls to the target telephone as it is to a suspect placing calls from that telephone. It is true, as the United States suggests, that when read in the context of the other subdivisions of \u00a7 2518(1) (b), an argument can be made that Congress focused in subdivision (iv) on the primary user of the target telephone. But is is also clear from other sections of the statute that Congress expected that wiretap applications would name more than one individual. For example, Title III requires that inventory notice be served upon \"the persons named in the order or the application.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(8)(d) (emphasis added). And \u00a7 2518(1)(e) requires that an intercept application disclose all previous intercept applications \"involving any of the same persons . . . specified in the application\" (emphasis added). It may well be that Congress anticipated that a given application would cover more than one telephone or that several suspects would use one telephone, and that an application for those reasons alone would require identification of more than one individual. But nothing on the face of the statute suggests that Congress intended to remove from the identification requirement those suspects whose intercepted communications originated on a telephone other than that listed in the wiretap application.14\n\n\n12\nNor can we find support in the legislative history for the \"principal target\" interpretation. Title III originated as a combination of S. 675, the Federal Wire Interception Act, which was introduced by Senator McClellan several months prior to this Court's decision in Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, 87 S.Ct. 1873, 18 L.Ed.2d 1040 (1967), and S. 2050, the Electronic Surveillance Control Act of 1967, introduced by Senator Hruska a few days after the Berger decision. S.Rep.No.1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 66 (1968), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1968, p. 2112. Both bills required that wiretap applications include a full and complete statement of the facts and circumstances relied upon by the applicant and specification of the nature and location of the communication facilities involved. Although neither bill contained an express identification requirement such as that at issue here, both bills required the application to include a \"full and complete statement of the facts concerning all previous applications . . . involving any person named in the application as committing, having committed, or being about to commit an offense.\" Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Criminal Laws and Procedures of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on Controlling Crime Through More Effective Law Enforcement, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 77, \u00a7 8(a)(3), and p. 1006, \u00a7 2518(4)(a) (1967) (emphasis added). Thus, even at this early stage, it was recognized that an application could identify several individuals, and there is no indication that the identification would be limited to principal targets.\n\n\n13\nS. 917 combined the major provisions of S. 675 and S. 2050 and eventually was enacted. While it was pending before the Senate Judiciary Committee, this Court decided Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). S. 917 was then redrafted to conform to Katz as well as Berger, and the identification provision was added at that time. The Senate Report states that the requirements set forth in the various subdivisions of \u00a7 2518(1)(b), including the identification requirement at issue here, were intended to \"reflect . . . the constitutional command of particularization.\" S.Rep.No.1097, supra, at 101, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1968, p. 2190, citing Berger v. New York, supra, 388 U.S., at 58-60, 87 S.Ct., at 1883, and Katz v. United States, supra, 389 U.S., at 354-356, 88 S.Ct., at 512. The United States now contends that although it may be that Congress read Berger and Katz to require, as a constitutional matter, that the subject of the surveillance be named if known, Congress would hardly have read those cases as requiring the naming of all parties likely to be overheard.15 Brief for United States 25-26. But to the extent that Congress thought it was meeting the constitutional commands of particularization established in Berger and Katz, Congress may have read those cases as mandating a broad identification requirement. The statute that we confronted in Berger required identification of \"the person or persons\" whose communications were to be overheard. 388 U.S., at 59, 87 S.Ct. at 1883. And we expressly noted that that provision \"(did) no more than identify the person whose constitutionally protected area is to be invaded . . ..\" Ibid. Given the statute at issue in Berger and our comment upon it, Congress may have concluded that the Constitution required the naming, in a wiretap application, of all suspects rather than just the primary user.16\n\n\n14\nIn any event, for our present purposes it is unnecessary to speculate as to exactly how Congress interpreted Berger and Katz with respect to the identification issue. It is sufficient to note that in response to those decisions Congress included an identification requirement which on its face draws no distinction based on the telephone one uses, and the United States points to no evidence in the legislative history that supports such a distinction. Indeed, the legislative materials apparently contain no use of the term \"principal target\" or any discussion of a different treatment based on the telephone from which a suspect speaks.17 We therefore conclude that a wiretap application must name an individual if the Government has probable cause to believe that the individual is engaged in the criminal activity under investigation and expects to intercept the individual's conversations over the target telephone.\n\nB\n\n15\nThe other statutory provision at issue in this case is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(8) (d), which provides that the judge shall cause to be served on the persons named in the order or application an inventory, which must give notice of the entry of the order or application, state the disposition of the application, and indicate whether communications were intercepted.18 Although the statute mandates inventory notice only for persons named in the application or the order, the statute also provides that the judge may order similar notice to other parties to intercepted communications if he concludes that such action is in the interest of justice.19 Observing that this notice provision does not expressly require law enforcement authorities routinely to supply the judge with specific information upon which to exercise his discretion, the United States contends that it would be inappropriate to read such a requirement into the statute since the judge has the option of asking the law enforcement authorities for whatever information he requires.\n\n\n16\nOur reading of the legislative history of the discretionary notice provision in light of the purposes of Title III leads us to reject the Government's interpretation. As reported from the Judiciary Committee, \u00a7 2518(8)(d) contained only a provision mandating notice to the persons named in the application or the order; the discretionary notice provision was added by amendment on the floor of the Senate. In introducing that amendment, Senator Hart explained its purpose:\n\n\n17\n\"The amendment would give the judge who issued the order      discretion to require notice to be served on other parties to      intercepted communications, even though such parties are not specifically named in the court order. The      Berger and Katz decisions established that notice of      surveillance is a constitutional requirement of any      surveillance statute. It may be that the required notice must      be served on all parties to intercepted communications. Since      legitimate interests of privacy may make such notice to all      parties undesirable, the amendment leaves the final      determination to the judge.\" 114 Cong.Rec. 14485-14486      (1968).20\n\n\n18\nIn deciding whether legitimate privacy interests justify withholding inventory notice from parties to intercepted conversations, a judge is likely to require information and assistance beyond that contained in the application papers and the recordings of intercepted conversations made available by law enforcement authorities. No purpose is served by holding that those authorities have no routine duty to supply the judge with relevant information. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently confronted this problem of dual responsibility, and we adopt the balanced construction that court placed on \u00a7 2518(8)(d):\n\n\n19\n\"To discharge this obligation the judicial officer must have,      at a minimum, knowledge of the particular categories into      which fall all the individuals whose conversations have been intercepted. Thus, while precise      identification of each party to an intercepted communication      is not required, a description of the general class, or      classes, which they comprise is essential to enable the judge      to determine whether additional information is necessary for      a proper evaluation of the interests of the various parties.      Furthermore, although the judicial officer has the duty to      cause the filing of the inventory (notice), it is abundantly      clear that the prosecution has greater access to and      familiarity with the intercepted communications. Therefore we      feel justified in imposing upon the latter the duty to      classify all those whose conversations have been intercepted,      and to transmit this information to the judge. Should the      judge desire more information regarding these classes in      order to exercise his (statutory) \u00a7 2518(8)(d) discretion, .      . . the government is (also) required to furnish such      information as is available to it.\" United States v. Chun, 9      Cir., 503 F.2d 533, 540 (1974). (Footnote omitted.)\n\n\n20\nWe agree with the Ninth Circuit that this allocation of responsibility best serves the purposes of Title III.21\n\n\n21\nCurrently, the policy of the Justice Department is to provide the issuing judge with the name of every person who has been overheard as to whom there is any reasonable possibility of indictment. Brief for United States 39. Because it fails to assure that the necessary range of information will be before the issuing judge, this policy does not meet the test set out in Chun. Moreover, where as here, the Government chooses to supply the issuing judge with a list of all identifiable persons rather than a description of the classes into which those persons fall, the list must be complete. Applying these principles, we find that the Government did not comply adequately with \u00a7 2518(8)(d), since the names of respondents Merlo and Lauer were not included on the purportedly complete list of identifiable persons submitted to the issuing judge.\n\nIII\n\n22\nWe turn now to the question whether the District Court properly suppressed evidence derived from the wiretaps at issue solely because of the failure of the law enforcement authorities to comply fully with the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 2518(1)(b)(iv) and 2518(8)(d). Section 2515 expressly prohibits the use at trial, and at certain other proceedings, of the contents of any intercepted wire communication or any evidence derived therefrom \"if the disclosure of that information would be in violation of this chapter.\" The circumstances that trigger suppression under \u00a7 2515 are in turn enumerated in \u00a7 2518(10)(a):\n\n\n23\n\"(i) the communication was unlawfully intercepted;\n\n\n24\n\"(ii) the order of authorization or approval under which it      was intercepted is insufficient on its face; or\n\n\n25\n\"(iii) the interception was not made in conformity with the      order of authorization or approval.\"\n\n\n26\nThere is no basis on the facts of this case to suggest that the authorization orders are facially insufficient, or that the interception was not conducted in conformity with the orders. Thus, only \u00a7 2518(10)(a)(i) is relevant: Were the communications \"unlawfully intercepted\" given the violations of \u00a7\u00a7 2518(1)(b) (iv) and 2518(8)(d)?22 Resolution of that question must begin with United States v. Giordano, 416 U.S. 505, 94 S.Ct. 1820, 40 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974), and United States v. Chavez, 416 U.S. 562, 94 S.Ct. 1849, 40 L.Ed.2d 380 (1974). Those cases hold that \"(not) every failure to comply fully with any requirement provided in Title III would render the interception of wire or oral communications 'unlawful.' \" Id., at 416 U.S., at 574-575, 94 S.Ct., at 1856. To the contrary, suppression is required only for a \"failure to satisfy any of those statutory requirements that directly and substantially implement the congressional intention to limit the use of intercept procedures to those situations clearly calling for the employment of this extraordinary investigative device.\" United States v. Giordano, supra, 416 U.S., at 527, 94 S.Ct., at 1832.\n\n\n27\nGiordano concerned the provision in Title III requiring that an application for an intercept order be approved by the Attorney General or an Assistant Attorney General specially designated by the Attorney General. Concluding that Congress intended to condition the use of wiretap procedures on the judgment of senior officials in the Department of Justice, the Court required suppression for failure to comply with the approval provision. Chavez concerned the statutory requirement that the application for an intercept order specify the identity of the official authorizing the application. The problem in Chavez was one of misidentification; although the application had in fact been authorized by the Attorney General, the application erroneously identified an Assistant Attorney General as the official authorizing the application. The Court concluded that mere misidentification of the official authorizing the application did not make the application unlawful within the meaning of \u00a7 2518(10)(a)(i) since that identification requirement did not play a \"substantive role\" in the regulatory system. 416 U.S., at 578, 94 S.Ct. at 1857.\n\n\n28\nIn the instant case, the Court of Appeals concluded that both the identification requirement of \u00a7 2518(1)(b)(iv) and the notice requirement of \u00a7 2518(8)(d) played a \"central role\" in the statutory framework, and for that reason affirmed the District Court's order suppressing relevant evidence. Although both statutory requirements are undoubtedly important, we do not think that the failure to comply fully with those provisions renders unlawful an intercept order that in all other respects satisfies the statutory requirements.\n\nA.\n\n29\nAs to \u00a7 2518(1)(b)(iv), the issue is whether the identification in an intercept application of all those likely to be overheard in incriminating conversations plays a \"substantive role\" with respect to judicial authorization of intercept orders and consequently imposes a limitation on the use of intercept procedures. The statute provides that the issuing judge may approve an intercept application if he determines that normal investigative techniques have failed or are unlikely to succeed and there is probable cause to believe that: (i) an individual is engaged in criminal activity; (ii) particular communications concerning the offense will be obtained through interception; and (iii) the target facilities are being used in connection with the specified criminal activity. \u00a7\u00a7 2518(3)(a-d). That determination is based on the \"full and complete statement\" of relevant facts supplied by law enforcement authorities. If, after evaluating the statutorily enumerated factors in light of the information contained in the application, the judge concludes that the wiretap order should issue, the failure to identify additional persons who are likely to be overheard engaging in incriminating conversations could hardly invalidate an otherwise lawful judicial authorization. The intercept order may issue only if the issuing judge determines that the statutory factors are present, and the failure to name additional targets in no way detracts from the sufficiency of those factors.\n\n\n30\nThis case is unlike Giordano, where failure to satisfy the statutory requirement of prior approval by specified Justice Department officials bypassed a congressionally imposed limitation on the use of the intercept procedure. The Court there noted that it was reasonable to believe that requiring prior approval from senior officials in the Justice Department \"would inevitably foreclose resort to wiretapping in various situations where investigative personnel would otherwise seek intercept authority from the court and the court would very likely authorize its use.\" 416 U.S., at 528, 94 S.Ct. at 1832. Here, however, the statutorily imposed preconditions to judicial authorization were satisfied, and the issuing judge was simply unaware that additional persons might be overheard engaging in incriminating conversations. In no meaningful sense can it be said that the presence of that information as to additional targets would have precluded judicial authorization of the intercept.23 Rather, this case resembles Chavez, where we held that a wiretap was not unlawful simply because the issuing judge was incorrectly informed as to which designated official had authorized the application. The Chavez intercept was lawful because the Justice Department had performed its task of prior approval, and the instant intercept is lawful because the application provided sufficient information to enable the issuing judge to determine that the statutory preconditions were satisfied.24 Finally, we note that nothing in the legislative history suggests that Congress intended this broad identification requirement to play \"a central, or even functional, role in guarding against unwarranted use of wiretapping or electronic surveillance.\" United States v. Chavez, 416 U.S., at 578, 94 S.Ct. at 1857. Neither S. 675 nor S. 2050, the predecessor bills of S. 917, contained an identification provision. See supra, at 426. The only explanation given in the Senate Report for the inclusion of the broad identification provision was that it was intended to reflect what Congress perceived to be the constitutional command of particularization. This explanation was offered with respect to all the information required by \u00a7 2518(1)(b) to be set out in an intercept application. No additional guidance can be gleaned from the floor debates, since they contain no substantive discussion of the identification provision.25\n\nB\n\n31\nWe reach the same conclusion with respect to the Government's duty to inform the judge of all identifiable persons whose conversations were intercepted. As noted earlier, the version of Title III that emerged from the Senate Judiciary Committee provided only for mandatory notice to the \"persons named in the order or the application.\" The Senate Report detailed the purpose of that provision:\n\n\n32\n\"(T)he intent of the provision is that the principle of      postuse notice will be retained. This provision alone should      insure the community that the techniques are reasonably      employed. Through its operation all authorized interceptions      must eventually become known at least to the subject. He can      then seek appropriate civil redress for example, under      section 2520 . . . if he feels that his privacy has been      unlawfully invaded.\" S.Rep.No.1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 105      (1968), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, p. 2194.\n\n\n33\nThe floor discussion concerning the amendment adding the provision for discretionary notice merely indicates an intent to provide notice to such additional persons as may be constitutionally required.\n\n\n34\nNothing in the structure of the Act or this legislative history suggests that incriminating conversations are \"unlawfully intercepted\" whenever parties to those conversations do not receive discretionary inventory notice as a result of the Government's failure to inform the District Court of their identities. At the time inventory notice was served on the other identifiable persons, the intercept had been completed and the conversations had been \"seized\" under a valid intercept order. The fact that discretionary notice reached 39 rather than 41 identifiable persons does not in itself mean that the conversations were unlawfully intercepted.26\n\n\n35\nThe legislative history indicates that postintercept notice was designed instead to assure the community that the wiretap technique is reasonably employed. But even recognizing that Congress placed considerable emphasis on that aspect of the overall statutory scheme, we do not think that postintercept notice was intended to serve as an independent restraint on resort to the wiretap procedure.\n\nIV\n\n36\nAlthough the Government was required to identify respondents Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzacco in the December 26 application for an extension of the initial intercept, failure to do so in the circumstances here presented did not warrant suppression under \u00a7 2518(10)(a)(i). Nor was suppression justified with respect to respondents Merlo and Lauer simply because the Government inadvertently omitted their names from the comprehensive list of all identifiable persons whose conversations had been overheard. We hold that this is the correct result under the provisions of Title III, but we reemphasize the suggestion we made in United States v. Chavez, that \"strict adherence by the Government to the provisions of Title III would nonetheless be more in keeping with the responsibilities Congress has imposed upon it when authority to engage in wiretapping or electronic surveillance is sought.\" 416 U.S., at 580, 94 S.Ct. at 1858.\n\n\n37\nThe order of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n38\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n39\nMr. Chief Justice BURGER, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n40\nI concur in the Court's judgment and in all except Part II-A of the Court's opinion. I cannot agree, however, with the Court's construction of the identification provisions of \u00a7 2518(1)(b)(iv), since I believe the application for surveillance in this case complied with statutory requirements. However, the precise reach of the identification requirement is irrelevant because respondents are foreclosed from seeking suppression in any event.\n\n\n41\nRespondents Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzacco contend that, since their names were not contained in the wiretap application, suppression is required under the express exclusionary provision of Title III, \u00a7 2518(10)(a). Their contention flies in the teeth of legislative history directly to the contrary. In the evolution of Title III, Congress considered and rejected a proposed amendment which would have expressly conferred the exclusionary benefit that respondents now seek. Specifically, Senators Long and Hart proposed the addition of a fourth subdivision to the suppression provision contained in \u00a7 2518(10)(a). 114 Cong.Rec. 14718 (1968). Had that proposal been adopted, it would have allowed suppression of intercepted conversations at the behest of any aggrieved person on the ground that he or she was not named in the application or extension.1 In its comment on the proposal, the Department of Justice said:\n\n\n42\n\"The amendment would permit intercepted communications to be      used in evidence only against the persons named in the court      order, not against other persons.\" Ibid. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n43\nConsistent with the Justice Department's recommendation, the Senate rejected the result which respondents now seek.\n\n\n44\nEven if the legislative history were silent with respect to suppression, however, I would nonetheless take issue with the Court's analysis of the identification requirement. In my view, Congress required no more than that a wiretap application identify by name the primary user of the monitored facility.\n\n\n45\nCongress drafted this statute with exacting precision. As its principal sponsor, Senator McClellan, put it:\n\n\n46\n\"(A) bill as controversial as this . . . requires close      attention to the dotting of every 'i' and the crossing of      every 't' . . . .\" Id., at 14751.\n\n\n47\nUnder these circumstances, the exact words of the statute provide the surest guide to determining Congress' intent, and we would do well to confine ourselves to that area. The statutory provision before us requires the wiretap application to specify the \"identity of the person, if known, committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(1) (b)(iv). (Emphasis supplied.) As the Court correctly indicates, the identification requirement was carefully added in the wake of Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, 87 S.Ct. 1873, 18 L.Ed.2d 1040 (1967). That case involved the constitutionality of a New York statute requiring the naming of \"the person or persons whose communications . . . are to be overheard.\" That very different statute plainly put Congress on notice that an identification provision could call, as did New York's, for the naming of multiple parties. Indeed, while requiring only the identification of \"the person\" whose communications are to be intercepted, Congress anticipated the obvious fact that interceptions effected pursuant to a single application and order could potentially affect a large number of persons. Standing to object to intercepted communications is conferred upon \"(a)ny aggrieved person . . . .\" \u00a7 2518(10)(a). In addition, a civil damages remedy is conferred upon \"(a)ny person\" whose communications are unlawfully intercepted or used in violation of the statute. Thus in fashioning highly specific requirements with respect to wiretap applications, Congress failed to employ language found in other parts of the same statute and so carefully written into the state statute at issue in the Berger case.\n\n\n48\nThe Court emphasizes, however, that the statute expressly recognizes that more than one person may be named in a wiretap application. Ante, at 425. That is indeed true. See \u00a7\u00a7 2518(1)(e), (8)(d). But I would think this is all the more reason for focusing upon the precise language in the provision establishing explicit requirements for an application. Since Congress expressly contemplated that applications might contain more than one name, its failure in \u00a7 2518(1)(b)(iv) to require the naming of \"any person\" or \"the persons\" whose communications are to be intercepted must mean that an open-ended identification requirement was never intended. In other words, Congress reasonably foresaw that, for a variety of reasons, actual wiretap applications might contain the names of more than one person. But Congress did not translate its recognition of what an application might reasonably contain into a command as to what it must contain.\n\n\n49\nAssuming that plain words of a statute might have to bow, in some circumstances, to compelling legislative history to the contrary, nothing of that kind is found here. As the Court observes, the earlier bills introduced in the Senate contained no identification provision at all. After Berger and Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967), were decided, the requirement was added in what was plainly an abundance of caution. For this Court in Berger flatly discounted any value in New York's broad identification requirement.\n\n\n50\n\"It is true that the statute requires the naming of 'the      person or persons whose communications, conversations or      discussions are to be overheard or recorded . . . .' But this      does no more than identify the person whose constitutionally      protected area is to be invaded rather than 'particularly      describing' the communications, conversations, or discussions      to be seized.\" 388 U.S., at 59, 87 S.Ct. at 1883. (Emphasis      supplied.)\n\n\n51\nAs shown by its rejection of the proposed suppression provision which obviously would have had the practical effect of increasing the number of persons identified in wiretap applications Congress correctly perceived little value in multiplying indefinitely the number of names to be set forth in wiretap applications and orders. This is particularly true since no Fourth Amendment values are served by a sweeping identification requirement. The Court has made clear:\n\n\n52\n\" 'The Fourth Amendment requires a warrant to describe only      \"the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be      seized,\" not the persons from whom things will be seized.' \"      United States v. Kahn, 415 U.S. 143, 155 n. 15, 94 S.Ct. 977,      984 39 L.Ed.2d 225 (1974). (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n53\nHence, the statute, as it presently stands, comports entirely with Fourth Amendment requirements, and thus achieves the express legislative purpose of \" 'reflect(ing) the constitutional commands of particularization.' \" Ante, at 427. Under those circumstances, it ill serves this Court to speculate that our coequal branch of Government, despite the clear teaching of the Constitution, incorrectly surmised \"that the Constitution (may have) required the naming . . . of all suspects rather than just the primary user.\" Ibid. In any event, if our own decisions have created confusion in the Congress, which is not surprising, nothing is gained by perpetuating that confusion in the face of Congress' clear intent to comply with this Court's interpretation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n\n54\nIn short, the Court has redrafted a statute passed by Congress to make it identical to a statutory provision found valueless by this Court a few years ago in the Berger case. This undertaking, unfortunately, is not entirely without consequence, notwithstanding the Court's refusal to approve suppression of the evidence here. Among other things, federal officers are potentially subject to a civil damages action, with compensatory damages of not less than $1,000, plus punitive damages, plus reasonable attorneys' fees.2 Nor is this federal remedy exclusive. State-provided damages remedies are not pre-empted. S.Rep.No. 1097, 90 Cong., 2d Sess., 107 (1968); 2 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1968, p. 2196. Damages awards aside, the Court's opinion albeit in dictum hints that suppression may indeed be in the offing if an intentional \"violation\" is shown. Finally, district judges will now be put to the task, at least in some cases, of determining whether probable cause exists with respect to each person listed in the application. \u00a7 2518(3)(d). Judges may well wonder why such burdens are imposed upon them for a gain which the Court found illusory in the Berger case.\n\n\n55\nI would therefore interpret this statute to mean just what it says and no more. Wisely or not, Congress decided, consistent with Fourth Amendment strictures, to require only the identification of \"the person\" whose conversations are to be intercepted. Since Congress demonstrably knew how to use other language when it so chose, I would take Congress at its word and not try to \"improve\" on its draftsmanship.\n\n\n56\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting in part.\n\n\n57\nThe Court today holds that an application for a warrant to authorize a wiretap under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520, must name all individuals who the Government has probable cause to believe are committing the offense being investigated and will be overheard. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(1)(b)(iv). It also holds that the Government must provide sufficient information to the issuing judge to allow him to exercise the discretion provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(8)(d). I fully agree with both of these holdings. The Court concludes, however, that if the Government violates these statutory commands, it is nevertheless free to use the intercepted communications as evidence in a criminal proceeding. I cannot agree.\n\n\n58\nI continue to adhere to the position, expressed for four Members of the Court by Mr. Justice Douglas in his dissent in United States v. Chavez, 416 U.S. 562, 584-585, 94 S.Ct. 1849, 1861, 40 L.Ed.2d 380 (1974), that Title III does not authorize \"the courts to pick and choose among various statutory provisions, suppressing evidence only when they determine that a provision is 'substantive,' 'central,' or 'directly and substantially' related to the congressional scheme.\" The Court has rejected that argument, however, see United States v. Chavez, supra; United States v. Giordano, 416 U.S. 505, 94 S.Ct. 1820, 40 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974), and nothing is to be gained by renewing it here. But even under the standard set forth in Giordano and Chavez and reaffirmed by the Court today, ante, at 433-434, the evidence at issue here should be suppressed.\n\n\n59\n* Title III requires that an application for a warrant to authorize wiretapping disclose \"the identity of the person, if known, committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(1)(b)(iv). The Court properly rejects the Government's contention that this provision requires it to name only the \"principal target\" of an investigation. In doing so, the Court relies both on the plain language and legislative history of the section, which do not support the Government's position, and on the statutory context. Ante, at 424-428. Part of that context is the obvious assumption of other portions of Title III that wiretap applications will name more than one target. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2518(1)(e), (8)(d). Another part is\n\n\n60\n\"the fact that identification of an individual in an      application for an intercept order triggers other statutory      provisions. First, \u00a7 2518(1)(e) requires an intercept      application to disclose all previous applications 'involving      any of the same persons . . . specified in the application.'      . . . Second, \u00a7 2518(8)(d) mandates that an inventory notice      be served upon 'the persons named in the order or the      application.' \" Ante, at 425 n. 14 (emphasis added).\n\n\n61\nYet in determining whether the identification requirement \"directly and substantially implement(s) the congressional intention to limit the use of intercept procedures,\" United States v. Giordano, supra, at 527, 94 S.Ct., at 1832, or plays a \"substantive role\" in the \"regulatory system\" established by Congress, United States v. Chavez, supra, 416 U.S., at 578, 94 S.Ct., at 1857, the Court ignores the requirement's function as a statutory \"trigger.\" In its analysis, the Court focuses solely on whether a list of additional names would affect a judge who must decide whether to issue a warrant. The Court reasons that once the judge has concluded that the specific requirements of \u00a7 2518(3)1 have been met, the presence of additional names in the warrant application could not change his decision. Ante, at 435-436. Failure to provide those names is, therefore, insignificant.\n\n\n62\nThe Court's reasoning is doubly flawed. First, a judge is not required to issue a warrant if the prerequisites of \u00a7 2518(3) are satisfied; he may do so. Once he determines that the \u00a7 2518(3) requirements have been met, he still must decide whether the invasion of privacy by the proposed wiretap is justified under the circumstances.2 Second, what is at issue here is more than a simple list of names. Section 2518(1)(e) requires that the Government disclose to the court the history of all prior applications to intercept the communications of anyone named in a warrant application. A history of recent applications would at the least cause a judge to consider whether the application before him was an attempt to circumvent the restrictive rulings of another judge or to continue an unjustified invasion of privacy.3 The decision whether to issue the warrant would certainly be affected by such consideration.4\n\n\n63\nIt is true, as the Court notes, ante, at 436 n. 23,5 that there is no allegation in this case that had the District Court been informed that the Government expected to overhear respondents Donovan, Buzzacco, and Robbins discussing illegal gambling activities it would not have issued a warrant. But that fact is irrelevant to an analysis of the role of the naming requirement in the regulatory system established by Congress. In Giordano, the Court rejected the argument that the Attorney General's failure to authorize the application for a warrant could be disregarded because the Attorney General had later ratified the application, thus demonstrating that he would have approved it originally. 416 U.S., at 523-524, n. 12, 94 S.Ct. at 1830. The important consideration was whether the requirement of high-level authorization was designed to play an important role, not whether it would have mattered in the particular case. The same analysis should be used here.\n\n\n64\nMoreover, even where there is no prior interception or application to disclose, as is apparently the case here, the naming requirement plays a vital role in the system designed by Congress. For unless that requirement is complied with from the first interception, no judge will know that a later interception is not the first. In addition, the naming requirement triggers the mandatory notification provision of \u00a7 2518(8)(d), another important component of the congressional design.6\n\n\n65\nThus, I conclude that the naming requirement recognized by the majority does play a \"substantive role\" in the system designed by Congress to limit the use of electronic surveillance. Failure to comply with that requirement, therefore, should lead to suppression on the ground that \"the communication was unlawfully intercepted.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(10)(a)(i).\n\nII\n\n66\nThe Court's discussion of the consequences of the Government's failure to comply with the notice provision of \u00a7 2518(8)(d) parallels its discussion of the naming requirement, and is similarly flawed. The Court does recognize that the notice provision was designed to assure the community that the wiretap technique is reasonably employed and that \"Congress placed considerable emphasis on that aspect of the overall statutory scheme.\" Ante, at 439. But because notice occurs after the intercept is completed, and because notice is not itself \"an independent restraint on resort to the wiretap procedure,\" the Court concludes that failure to notify does not render an interception \"unlawful\" under \u00a7 2518(10)(a)(i). Ante, at 439.\n\n\n67\nAgain, the Court takes too narrow a view of the provision at issue, ignoring its place in the system Congress has created to restrain wiretapping. That system involves not only direct restraints on applying for a warrant, but also restraints which reduce wiretaps by providing sanctions for misuse of surveillance techniques. Those sanctions are both criminal, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(1), and civil, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2520. Congress designed the notice provisions of \u00a7 2518(8)(d) to provide the information necessary to make the civil sanctions of \u00a7 2520 meaningful. The congressional analysis of \u00a7 2520 states:\n\n\n68\n\"Injunctive relief, with its attendant discovery proceedings,      is not intended to be available . . . . It is expected that      civil suits, if any, will instead grow out of the filing of      inventories under section 2518(8)(d).\" S.Rep.No.1097, 90th      Cong., 2d Sess., 107 (1968), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, p.      2196.\n\n\n69\nSee also id., at 105.\n\n\n70\nThe Court's conclusion that the notice provision is not central dismantles this carefully designed congressional structure.\n\nIII\n\n71\nThe Court's opinion implies that if the violations of Title III considered here had been intentional, the result would be different. Ante, at 436 n. 23, 439 n. 26. This must be so, for surely this Court would not tolerate the Government's intentional disregard of duties imposed on it by Congress. I also assume that if the Government fails to establish procedures which offer reasonable assurance that it will strictly adhere to the statutory requirements, see ante, at 439-440, resulting failures to comply will be recognized as intentional. There is, therefore, reason to hope that the Court's admonition that the Government should obey the law will have some effect in the future.\n\n\n72\nBut that hope is a poor substitute for certainty that the Government will make every effort to fulfill its responsibilities under Title III. We can obtain that certainty only by according full recognition to the role of the naming and notice requirements in the statutory scheme created by Congress. I respectfully dissent from the Court's failure to do so.\n\n\n73\nMr. Justice STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\n74\nFor the reasons stated in Parts I and II of Mr. Justice MARSHALL's opinion, I respectfully dissent from Parts III and IV of the Court's opinion. I join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion.\n\n\n\n1\n The wiretap application procedure is set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(1), which provides:\n\"(1) Each application for an order authorizing or approving the interception of a wire or oral communication shall be made in writing upon oath or affirmation to a judge of competent jurisdiction and shall state\nthe applicant's authority to make such application. Each application shall include the following information:\n\"(a) the identity of the investigative or law enforcement officer making the application, and the officer authorizing the application;\n\"(b) a full and complete statement of the facts and circumstances relied upon by the applicant, to justify his belief that an order should be issued, including (i) details as to the particular offense that has been, is being, or is about to be committed, (ii) a particular description of the nature and location of the facilities from which or the place where the communication is to be intercepted, (iii) a particular description of the type of communications sought to be intercepted, (iv) the identity of the person, if known, committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted;\n\"(c) a full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous;\n\"(d) a statement of the period of time for which the interception is required to be maintained. If the nature of the investigation is such that the authorization for interception should not automatically terminate when the described type of communication has been first obtained, a particular description of facts establishing probable cause to believe that additional communications of the same type will occur thereafter;\n\"(e) a full and complete statement of the facts concerning all previous applications known to the individual authorizing and making the application, made to any judge for authorization to intercept, or for approval of interceptions of, wire or oral communications involving any of the same persons, facilities or places specified in the application, and the action taken by the judge on each such application; and\n\"(f) where the application is for the extension of an order, a statement setting forth the results thus far obtained from the interception, or a reasonable explanation of the failure to obtain such results.\"\nThe issuing judge is free to require the applicant to furnish additional information. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(2).\n\n\n2\n The affidavit set forth extensive information indicating that the named individuals were conducting a gambling operation. This information was derived from physical surveillance by agents of the FBI, an examination of telephone company toll records, and the personal observations of six informants, whose past reliability also was detailed in the affidavit.\n\n\n3\n The District Court's order was issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2518(3), (4), which provide in pertinent part:\n\"(3) Upon such application the judge may enter an ex parte order, as requested or as modified, authorizing or approving interception of wire or oral communications within the territorial jurisdiction of the court in which the judge is sitting, if the judge determines on the basis of the facts submitted by the applicant that\n\"(a) there is probable cause for belief that an individual is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a particular offense enumerated in section 2516 of this chapter;\n\"(b) there is probable cause for belief that particular communications concerning that offense will be obtained through such interception;\n\"(c) normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous;\n\"(d) there is probable cause for belief that the facilities from which, or the place where, the wire or oral communications are to be intercepted are being used, or are about to be used, in connection with the commission of such offense, or are leased to, listed in the name of, or commonly used by such person.\n\"(4) Each order authorizing or approving the interception of any wire or oral communication shall specify\n\"(a) the identity of the person, if known, whose communications are to be intercepted;\n\"(b) the nature and location of the communications facilities as to which, or the place where, authority to intercept is granted;\n\"(c) a particular description of the type of communication sought to be intercepted, and a statement of the particular offense to which it relates;\n\"(d) the identify of the agency authorized to intercept the communications, and of the person authorizing the application; and\n\"(e) the period of time during which such interception is authorized, including a statement as to whether or not the interception shall automatically terminate when the described communication has been first obtained.\"\n\n\n4\n In addition to the December 26 application requesting an extension of the initial intercept order, the Government also filed on that date a separate application seeking authorization to monitor a third telephone discovered at the same North Olmstead address. Both applications were accompanied by another affidavit setting forth the results of the initial monitoring, the manner in which the third telephone was discovered, the facts indicating that the newly discovered telephone was being used to conduct a gambling business, and reasons why continued interception was necessary. A copy of the affidavit filed on November 28 was also attached to the December 26 applications. For the sake of clarity, the two applications filed on December 26 will be treated as a single application.\n\n\n5\n The United States conceded in the Court of Appeals that respondents Donovan and Robbins were \"known\" within the meaning of the statute at the time of the December 26 application, but challenged as clearly erroneous the District Court's finding that respondent Buzzacco was \"known\" at that time. The Court of Appeals upheld the District Court's finding, and the United States has not sought review of that disposition. Thus, for our purposes, all three respondents were \"known\" on December 26.\n\n\n6\n An inventory notice must be served within a designated period of time upon \"the persons named in the order or the application.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(8) (d). The inventory must give notice of the entry of the intercept order or application, state the disposition of the application, and indicate whether communications were or were not intercepted. Ibid. Upon the filing of a motion, the judge has discretion to make available the intercepted communications, the applications, and the orders. Ibid.\nTitle III also authorizes the District Court to cause an inventory notice to be served on \"other parties to intercepted communications\" if the judge determines that such notice is in the interest of justice. Ibid. Those other parties may also be given access to the intercepted communications, the applications, and the orders. Ibid.\n\n\n7\n Although respondents Merlo and Lauer were not served with inventory notice pursuant to \u00a7 2518(8)(d), the intercept orders, applications, and related papers were made available to all the defendants, including Merlo and Lauer, on November 26, 1973. Thus, the introduction into evidence at trial of the contents of the intercepted conversations and evidence derived therefrom would not be prohibited by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(9).\n\n\n8\n The Government filed its appeal from the District Court's order suppressing evidence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731, and there has been no trial on the charges with respect to the respondents.\n\n\n9\n See n. 6, supra.\n\n\n10\n Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(10)(a) provides in pertinent part:\n\"(10)(a) Any aggrieved person in any trial, hearing, or proceeding in or before any court, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, or other authority of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision thereof, may move to suppress the contents of any intercepted wire or oral communication, or evidence derived therefrom, on the grounds that\n\"(i) the communication was unlawfully intercepted;\n\"(ii) the order of authorization or approval under which it was intercepted is insufficient on its face; or\n\"(iii) the interception was not made in conformity with the order of authorization or approval.\"\n\n\n11\n Every Court of Appeals that has considered the issue has concluded that an individual whose conversations probably will be intercepted by a wiretap must be identified in the wiretap application if the law enforcement authorities have probable cause to believe the individual is committing the offense for which the wiretap is sought. United States v. Chiarizio, 525 F.2d 289, 292 (C.A.2 1975); United States v. Bernstein, 509 F.2d 996 (C.A.4 1975), cert. pending, No. 74-1486; United States v. Doolittle, 507 F.2d 1368 (CA5), aff'd en banc, 518 F.2d 500 (1975), cert. pending, Nos. 75-500, 75-509, 75-513; United States v. Civella, 533 F.2d 1395 (C.A.8 1976), cert. pending, Nos. 75-1813, 76-169; United States v. Russo, 527 F.2d 1051, 1056 (C.A.10 1975), cert. denied, 426 U.S. 906, 96 S.Ct. 2226, 48 L.Ed.2d 831 (1976). See also United States v. Moore, 168 U.S.App.D.C. 227, 235-236, 513 F.2d 485, 493-494 (1975) (interpreting D.C.Code \u00a7 23-547(a)(2)(D), which is almost identical to the provision at issue here).\nA number of these courts have concluded, and respondents Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzacco argue, that our decision in United States v. Kahn, 415 U.S. 143, 94 S.Ct. 977, 39 L.Ed.2d 225 (1974), resolved this identification issue. See United States v. Chiarizio, supra; United States v. Moore, supra. Although there is language in Kahn suggesting that wiretap applications must identify all such individuals, the identification question presented here was not before us in Kahn. The question in that case was whether a wiretap application had to identify a known user of the target telephone whose complicity in the criminal activity under investigation was not known at the time of the application. Kahn is a relevant, though not controlling, precedent.\n\n\n12\n The United States does not suggest that regardless of the factual circumstances a wiretap application must identify only a single individual. To the contrary, it concedes that if two or more persons are using the target telephone \"equally\" to commit the offense, and thus are \"equally\" targets of the investigation, \"all must be named.\" Brief for United States 18 n. 13.\n\n\n13\n Counsel for the United States explained this position succinctly at oral argument: \"The critical distinction . . . is (one) between the users of the telephone that is being monitored on the one hand, and all other persons throughout the world who may converse from unmonitored phones on the other hand.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 13.\n\n\n14\n Indeed, the contrary conclusion is suggested by the fact that identification of an individual in an application for an intercept order triggers other statutory provisions. First, \u00a7 2518(1)(e) requires an intercept application to disclose all previous applications \"involving any of the same persons . . . specified in the application.\" To the extent that Congress thought it necessary to provide the issuing judge with such information, there is no indication of congressional intent to require provision of such information only if a suspect operated from one end of a telephone line. Second, \u00a7 2518(8)(d) mandates that an inventory notice be served upon \"the persons named in the order or the application.\" As with \u00a7 2518(1)(e), the congressional purpose would not be served by limiting that notice on the basis of the telephone from which one speaks.\n\n\n15\n At the time of the enactment of Title III, Congress did not have before it the view we expressed on this issue in United States v. Kahn, 415 U.S., at 155 n. 15, 94 S.Ct. at 984. The Fourth Amendment requires specification of \"the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\" In the wiretap context, those requirements are satisfied by identification of the telephone line to be tapped and the particular conversations to be seized. It is not a constitutional requirement that all those likely to be overheard engaging in incriminating conversations be named. Specification of this sort \"identif(ies) the person whose constitutionally protected area is to be invaded rather than 'particularly describing' the communications, conversations, or discussions to be seized.\" Berger v. New York, 388 U.S., at 59, 87 S.Ct., at 1883.\n\n\n16\n That Congress may have so understood the constitutional requirement is also suggested by the portion of the Senate Report dealing with that provision of S. 917 that required the intercept order to \"specify the identity, of the individual if known, whose communications are to be intercepted.\" The Senate Report merely cites West v. Cabell, 153 U.S. 78, 14 S.Ct. 752, 38 L.Ed. 643 (1894), which concerns the need for proper identification of the subject of an arrest warrant. S.Rep.No.1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 102 (1968). To the extent that Congress may have considered West to apply to wiretap orders, we have no reason to believe that Congress considered its applicability to extend only to those suspects using the target telephone.\n\n\n17\n At least one Senator read the identification requirement in S. 917 to parallel the identification requirement contained in the statute at issue in Berger v. New York: \"Specificity is required as to the person or persons whose communications will be intercepted.\" 114 Cong.Rec. 14763 (1968) (remarks of Sen. Percy).\n\n\n18\n The inventory notice must be served within a reasonable time but not later than 90 days after the date the application for an intercept order was filed. On an ex parte showing of good cause, service of the inventory may be postponed.\n\n\n19\n In addition to these provisions for mandatory and discretionary inventory notice, the Government is required to supply the issuing judge with recordings of the intercepted conversations, which are to be sealed according to his directions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(8)(a). These notice and return provisions satisfy constitutional requirements. See Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 355-356, 88 S.Ct. 507, 513, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 and n. 16 (1967); Berger v. New York, supra, 388 U.S., at 60, 87 S.Ct., at 1884.\n\n\n20\n It is worth noting that shortly before Senator Hart proposed this amendment to S. 917, Senator Long had read to the Senate portions of a report prepared by the Association of the Bar of the City of New York on federal wiretap legislation. That report commented that parties to intercepted conversations other than those named in the application or order probably should be served with inventory notice, but it also recognized that under some circumstances the provision of such notice could be harmful and gave the following example:\n\"A, a businessman, talks with his customers, and the latter are served with papers showing that A is being bugged . . . . (T)he damage to confidence in A and to A's reputation in general may damage A unjustly. In this case it would seem that the customers should not be served with the inventory.\" 114 Cong.Rec. 14476 (1968).\n\n\n21\n At oral argument, counsel for the United States recognized the merit of the approach specified in United States v. Chun:\n\"Perhaps the approach of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which suggested that rather than submitting specific names we should submit categories of persons who had been overheard, is a better policy, would be more helpful to the district court in exercising its discretion, and we would have no objection to following any reasonable policy that the district courts determine would be useful to them in this area.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 6-7.\n\n\n22\n The availability of the suppression remedy for these statutory,\nas opposed to constitutional, violations, see nn. 15 and 19, supra, turns on the provisions of Title III rather than the judicially fashioned exclusionary rule aimed at deterring violations of Fourth Amendment rights. United States v. Giordano, 416 U.S. 505, 524, 94 S.Ct. 1820, 1831, 40 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974).\nThe concurring opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE contends that respondents Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzacco lack standing even to seek suppression. Post, at 440-441. This contention rests on the ground that Congress rejected an amendment proposed by Senators Long and Hart that would have added a fourth ground justifying suppression namely, that the person against whom the Government sought to introduce the evidence was not named in the court order. Since these three respondents would have been entitled to suppression under the rejected amendment, the concurring opinion concludes they cannot seek suppression here.\nThis view fails to recognize that \u00a7 2518(10)(a) establishing the suppression remedy provides alternative grounds on which one can seek suppression of evidence derived from a wiretap. Thus, the mere fact that Congress chose not to add a fourth alternative could not mean that it intended to prevent persons who would have been covered by that alternative from seeking suppression on one of the other grounds. As the Justice Department commented, in the same statement cited in the concurring opinion: \"The (Long and Hart) amendment is designed to limit the scope of electronic surveillance, but it accomplishes this purpose in an artificial manner. So long as a court order is validly obtained, evidence obtained under the order should be admissible against any person not merely against the person named in the order.\" 114 Cong.Rec. 14718 (1968) (emphasis added). Here, respondents Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzacco challenge the validity of the court order, and nothing in either Congress' rejection of the proposed amendment or the Justice Department's comment thereon suggests that \u00a7 2518(10)(a)(i) is unavailable to persons who might have had a remedy under a provision not enacted by Congress.\n\n\n23\n There is no suggestion in this case that the Government agents knowingly failed to identify respondents Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzacco for the purpose of keeping relevant information from the District Court that might have prompted the court to conclude that probable cause was lacking. If such a showing had been made, we would have a different case. Nor is there any suggestion that as a result of the failure to name these three respondents they were denied the mandatory inventory notice supplied to persons named in the application. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(8)(d). Respondents Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzacco were among the 37 persons served with the initial inventory.\n\n\n24\n No one suggests that the failure to identify in a wiretap application individuals who are \"unknown\" within the meaning of the statute, see United States v. Kahn, 415 U.S. 143, 94 S.Ct. 977, 39 L.Ed.2d 225 (1974), requires suppression of intercepted conversations to which those individuals were parties. Though recognizing that the failure to identify such an \"unknown\" individual does not make unlawful an otherwise valid intercept order respondents Donovan, Robbins, and Buzzacco suggest that the opposite is true with respect to the failure to identify in a wiretap application individuals who are \"known\" within the meaning of the statute. Counsel for these respondents suggested at oral argument that this difference in result is justified by analogy to warrantless searches or arrests. Tr. of Oral Arg. 40. Although law enforcement officials can often take action without a warrant when they have been unable to foresee the circumstances that eventually confronted them, they still must obtain a search or arrest warrant when their prior knowledge is sufficient to establish probable cause, and it is suggested that the same principle applies here. The major flaw in that reasoning is that this case does not concern warrantless action. Here, the omission on the part of law enforcement authorities was not a failure to seek prior judicial authorization, but a failure to identify every individual who could be expected to be overhead engaging in incriminating conversations. That the complete absence of prior judicial authorization would make an intercept unlawful has no bearing on the lawfulness of an intercept order that fails to identify every target.\n\n\n25\n Even if we assume that Congress thought that a broad identification requirement was constitutionally mandated, it does not follow that Congress imposed statutory suppression under \u00a7\u00a7 2515 and 2518(10)(a)(i) as a sanction for noncompliance. In limiting use of the intercept procedure to \"the most precise and discriminate circumstances,\" S.Rep.No.1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 102 (1968), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, p. 2191, Congress required law enforcement authorities to convince a district court that probable cause existed to believe that a specific person was committing a specific offense using a specific telephone. This requirement was satisfied here when the application set forth sufficient information to indicate that the primary targets were conducting a gambling business over four particular telephones. Nothing in the legislative history indicates that Congress intended to declare an otherwise constitutional intercept order \"unlawful\" under \u00a7 2518(10)(a)(i) resulting in suppression under \u00a7 2515 for failure to name additional targets.\n\n\n26\n Counsel for respondents Merlo and Lauer conceded at oral argument that the failure to name those respondents in the proposed inventory order was not intentional, Tr. of Oral Arg. 32, and we are therefore not called upon to decide whether suppression would be an available remedy if the Government knowingly sought to prevent the District Court from serving inventory notice on particular parties. Nor does this case present an opportunity to comment upon the suggestion, recognized by the United States, Brief 49 n. 40, that suppression might be required if the agents knew before the interception that no inventory would be served.\nMoreover, respondents Merlo and Lauer were not prejudiced by their failure to receive postintercept notice under either of the District Court's inventory orders. As noted earlier, the Government made available to all defendants the intercept orders, applications, and related papers. See n. 7, supra. And in response to pretrial discovery motions, the Government produced transcripts of the intercepted conversations.\n\n\n1\n The proposed addition provided:\n\"(iv) That he was not the subject of such application, authorization, or extension thereof.\"\nIt is true that the proposal did not speak directly to instances, such as here, where persons arguably should have been named in the application and order, but were not. But respondents, as unnamed persons, would plainly have had a suppression remedy if the amendment had passed.\n\n\n2\n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2520. Since a court order will necessarily reflect the officers' \"violation,\" it is not entirely certain that reliance upon a court order will provide a sufficient defense to a civil damages action.\n\n\n1\n Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(3) provides, in pertinent part:\n\"Upon such application the judge may enter an ex parte order . . . if the judge determines on the basis of the facts submitted by the applicant that\n\"(a) there is probable cause for belief that an individual is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a particular offense enumerated in section 2516 of this chapter;\n\"(b) there is probable cause for belief that particular communications concerning that offense will be obtained through such interception;\n\"(c) normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous;\n\"(d) there is probable cause for belief that the facilities from which, or the place where, the wire or oral communications are to be intercepted are being used, or are about to be used, in connection with the commission of such offense, or are leased to, listed in the name of, or commonly used by such person.\"\n\n\n2\n The information which the applicant is required to provide to the district court by \u00a7\u00a7 2518(1)(d)-(f) would be superfluous if the decision whether to issue a warrant depended only on the findings specified in \u00a7 2518(3).\n\n\n3\n Cf. United States v. Bellosi, 163 U.S.App.D.C. 273, 501 F.2d 833 (1974).\n\n\n4\n Thus, this case is unlike United States v. Chavez. There, the Court concluded that the misidentification of the authorizing official as an Assistant Attorney General when the Attorney General had actually authorized the warrant application could not have affected the judge's decision to issue the warrant. 416 U.S., at 572, 94 S.Ct. at 1854.\n\n\n5\n The Court actually states only that there is no suggestion that the failure to name respondents kept from the judge information \"that might have prompted the court to conclude that probable cause was lacking.\" As I have shown, that formulation understates the District Court's role.\n\n\n6\n See Part II, infra.\n\n\n","label":0}

On February 16, 1911, thirty out of a total of thirty-nine owners of property fronting both sides of Labadie Avenue between Taylor Avenue and Cora Avenue in the city of St. Louis, signed an agreement, which was subsequently recorded, providing in part:\n\n\n3\n'* * * the said property is hereby restricted to the use and occupancy for the term of Fifty (50) years from this date, so that it shall be a condition all the time and whether recited and referred to as (sic) not in subsequent conveyances and shall attach to the land, as a condition precedent to the sale of the same, that hereafter no part of said property or any portion thereof shall be, for said term of Fifty-years, occupied by any person not of the Caucasian race, it being intended hereby to restrict the use of said property for said period of time against the occupancy as owners or tenants of any portion of said property for resident or other purpose by people of the Negro or Mongolian Race.'\n\n\n4\nThe entire district described in the agreement included fifty-seven parcels of lamd. The thirty owners who signed the agreement held title to forty-seven parcels, including the particular parcel involved in this case. At the time the agreement was signed, five of the parcels in the district were owned by Negroes. One of those had been occupied by Negro families since 1882, nearly thirty years before the restrictive agreement was executed. The trial court found that owners of seven out of nine homes on the south side of Labadie Avenue, within the restrit ed district and 'in the immediate vicinity' of the premises in question, had failed to sign the restrictive agreement in 1911. At the time this action was brought, four of the premises were occupied by Negroes, and had been so occupied for periods ranging from twenty-three to sixty-three years. A fifth parcel had been occupied by Negroes until a year before this suit was instituted.\n\n\n5\nOn August 11, 1945, pursuant to a contract of sale, petitioners Shelley, who are Negroes, for valuable consideration received from one Fitzgerald a warranty deed to the parcel in question.1 The trial court found that petitioners had no actual knowledge of the restrictive agreement at the time of the purchase.\n\n\n6\nOn October 9, 1945, respondents, as owners of other property subject to the terms of the restrictive covenant, brought suit in Circuit Court of the city of St. Louis prarying that petitioners Shelley be restrained from taking possession of the property and that judgment be entered divesting title out of petitioners Shelley and revesting title in the immediate grantor or in such other person as the court should direct. The trial court denied the requested relief on the ground that the restrictive agreement, upon which respondents based their action, had never become final and complete because it was the intention of the parties to that agreement that it was not to become effective until signed by all property owners in the district, and signatures of all the owners had never been obtained.\n\n\n7\nThe Supreme Court of Missouri sitting en banc reversed and directed the trial court to grant the relief for which respondents had prayed. That court held the agreement effective and concluded that enforcement of its provisions violated no rights guaranteed to petitioners by the Federal Constitution.2 At the time the court rendered its decision, petitioners were occupying the property in question.\n\n\n8\nThe second of the cases under consideration comes to this Court from the Supreme Court of Michigan. The circumstances presented do not differ materially from the Missouri case. In June, 1934, one Ferguson and his wife, who then owned the property located in the city of Detroit which is involved in this case, executed a contract providing in part:\n\n\n9\n'This property shall not be used or occupied by any person or persons except those of the Caucasian race.\n\n\n10\n'It is further agreed that this restriction shall not be effective unless at least eighty percent of the property fronting on both sides of the street in the block where our land is located is subjected to this or a similar restriction.'\n\n\n11\nThe agreement provided that the restrictions were to remain in effect until January 1, 1960. The contract was subsequently recorded; and similar agreements were executed with respect to eighty percent of the lots in the block in which the property in question is situated.\n\n\n12\nBy deed dated November 30, 1944, petitioners, who were found by the trial court to be Negroes, acquired title to the property and thereupon entered into its occupancy. On January 30, 1945, respondents, as owners of property subject to the terms of the restrictive agreement, brought suit against petitioners in the Circuit Court of Wayne County. After a hearing, the court entered a decree directing petitioners to move from the property within ninety days. Petitioners were further enjoined and restrained from using or occupying the premises in the future. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Michigan affirmed, deciding adversely to petitioners' contentions that they had been denied rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.3\n\n\n13\nPetitioners have placed primary reliance on their contentions, first raised in the state courts, that judicial enforcement of the restrictive agreements in these cases has violated rights guaranteed to petitioners by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution and Acts of Congress passed pursuant to that Amendment.4 Specifically, petitioners urge that they have been denied the equal protection of the laws, deprived of property without due process of law, and have been denied privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States. We pass to a consideration of those issues.\n\nI.\n\n14\nWhether the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment inhibits judicial enforcement by state courts of restrictive covenants based on race or color is a question which this Court has not heretofore been called upon to consider. Only two cases have been decided by this Court which in any way have involved the enforcement of such agreements. The first of these was the case of Corrigan v. Buckley, 1926, 271 U.S. 323, 46 S.Ct. 521, 70 L.Ed. 969. There, suit was brought in the courts of the District of Columbia to enjoin a threatened violation of certain restrictive covenants relating to lands situated in the city of Washington. Relief was granted, and the case was brought here on appeal. It is apparent that that case, which had originated in the federal courts and involved the enforcement of covenants on land located in the District of Columbia, could present no issues under the Fourteenth Amendment; for that Amendment by its terms applies only to the States. Nor was the question of the validity of court enforcement of the restrictive covenants under the Fifth Amendment properly before the Court, as the opinion of this Court specifically recognizes.5 The only constitutional issue which the appellants had raised in the lower courts, and hence the only constitutional issue before this Court on appeal, was the validity of the covenant agreements as such. This Court concluded that since the inhibitions of the constitutional provisions invoked, apply only to governmental action, as contrasted to action of private individuals, there was no showing that the covenants, which were simply agreements between private property owners, were invalid. Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed for want of a substantial question. Nothing in the opinion of this Court, therefore, may properly be regarded as an adjudication on the merits of the constitutional issues presented by these cases, which raise the question of the validity, not of the private agreements as such, but of the judicial enforcement of those agreements.\n\n\n15\nThe second of the cases involving racial restrictive covenants was Hansberry v. Lee, 1940, 311 U.S. 32, 61 S.Ct. 115, 85 L.Ed. 22, 132 A.L.R. 741. In that case, petitioners, white property owners, were enjoined by the state courts from violating the terms of a restrictive agreement. The state Supreme Court had held petitioners bound by an earlier judicial determination, in litigation in which petitioners were not parties, upholding the validity of the restrictive agreement, although, in fact, the agreement had not been signed by the number of owners necessary to make it effective under state law. This Court reversed the judgment of the state Supreme Court upon the ground that petitioners had been denied due process f  law in being held estopped to challenge the validity of the agreement on the theory, accepted by the state court, that the earlier litigation, in which petitioners did not participate, was in the nature of a class suit. In arriving at its result, this Court did not reach the issues presented by the cases now under consideration.\n\n\n16\nIt is well, at the outset, to scrutinize the terms of the restrictive agreemens involved in these cases. In the Missouri case, the covenant declares that no part of the affected property shall be (355 Mo. 814, 198 S.W.2d 681) 'occupied by any person not of the Caucasian race, it being intended hereby to restrict the use of said property * * * against the occupancy as owners or tenants of any portion of said property for resident or other purpose by people of the Negro or Mongolian Race.' Not only does the restricton seek to proscribe use and occupancy of the affected properties by members of the excluded class, but as construed by the Missouri courts, the agreement requires that title of any person who uses his property in violation of the restriction shall be divested. The restriction of the covenant in the Michigan case seeks to bar occupancy by persons of the excluded class. It provides that (316 Mich. 614, 25 N.W.2d 642) 'This property shall not be used or occupied by any person or persons except those of the Caucasian race.'\n\n\n17\nIt should be observed that these covenants do not seek to proscribe any particular use of the affected properties. Use of the properties for residential occupancy, as such, is not forbidden. The restrictions of these agreements, rather, are directed toward a designated class of persons and seek to determine who may and who may not own or make use of the properties for residential purposes. The excluded class is defined wholly in terms of race or color.; 'simply that and nothing more.'6\n\n\n18\nIt cannot be doubted that among the civil rights intended to be protected from discriminatory state action by the Fourteenth Amendment are the rights to acquire, enjoy, own and dispose of property. Equality in the enjoyment of property rights was regarded by the framers of that Amendment as an essential pre-condition to the realization of other basic civil rights and liberties which the Amendment was intended to guarantee.7 Thus, s 1978 of the Revised Statutes, derived from \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 which was enacted by Congress while the Fourteenth Amendment was also under consideration,8 provides:\n\n\n19\n'All citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.'9\n\n\n20\nThis Court has given specific recognition to the same principle. Buchanan v. Warley, 1917, 245 U.S. 60, 38 S.Ct. 16, 62 L.Ed. 149, L.R.A.1918C, 210, Ann.Cas.1918A, 1201.\n\n\n21\nIt is likewise clear that restrictions on the right of occupancy of the sort sought to be created by the private agreements in these cases could not be squared with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment if imposed by state statute or local ordinance. We do not understand respondents to urge the contrary. In the case of Buchanan v. Warley, supa, a unanimous Court declared unconstitutional the provisions of a city ordinance which denied to colr ed persons the right to occupy houses in blocks in which the greater number of houses were occupied by white persons, and imposed similar restrictions on white persons with respect to blocks in which the greater number of houses were occupied by colored persons. During the course of the opinion in that case, this Court stated: 'The Fourteenth Amendment and these statutes enacted in furtherance of its purpose operate to qualify and entitle a colored man to acquire property without state legislation discriminating against him solely because of color.'10\n\n\n22\nIn Harmon v. Tyler, 1927, 273 U.S. 668, 47 S.Ct. 471, 71 L.Ed. 831, a unanimous court, on the authority of Buchanan v. Warley, supra, declared invalid an ordinance which forbade any Negro to establish a home on any property in a white community or any white person to establish a home in a Negro community, 'except on the written consent of a majority of the persons of the opposite race inhabiting such community or portion of the City to be affected.'\n\n\n23\nThe precise question before this Court in both the Buchanan and Harmon cases, involved the rights of white sellers to dispose of their properties free from restrictions as to potential purchasers based on considerations of race or color. But that such legislation is also offensive to the rights of those desiring to acquire and occupy property and barred on grounds of race or color, is clear, not only from the language of the opinion in Buchanan v. Warley, supra, but from this Court's disposition of the case of City of Richmond v. Deans, 1930, 281 U.S. 704, 50 S.Ct. 407, 74 L.Ed. 1128. There, a Negro, barred from the occupancy of certain property by the terms of an ordinance similar to that in the Buchanan case, sought injunctive relief in the federal courts to enjoin the enforcement of the ordinance on the grounds that its provisions violated the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment. Such relief was granted, and this Court affirmed, finding the citation of Buchanan v. Warley, supra, and Harmon v. Tyler, supra, sufficient to support its judgment.11\n\n\n24\nBut the present cases, unlike those just discussed, do not involve action by state legislatures or city councils. Here the particular patterns of discrimination and the areas in which the restrictions are to operate, are determined, in tne first instance, by the terms of agreements among private individuals. Participation of the State consists in the enforcement of the restrictions so defined. The crucial issue with which we are here confronted is whether this distinction removes these cases from the operation of the prohibitory provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n25\nSince the decision of this Court in the Civil Rights Cases, 1883, 109 U.S. 3, 3 S.Ct. 18, 27 L.Ed. 835, the principle has become firmly embedded in our constitutional law that the action inhibited by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States. That Amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful.12\n\n\n26\nWe conclude, therefore, that the restrictive agreements standing alone cannot be regarded as a violation of any rights guaranteed to pt itioners by the Fourteenth Amendment. So long as the purposes of those agreements are effectuated by voluntary adherence to their terms, it would appear clear that there has been no action by the State and the provisions of the Amendment have not been violated. Cf. Corrigan v. Buckley, supra.\n\n\n27\nBut here there was more. These are cases in which the purposes of the agreements were secured only by judicial enforcement by state courts of the restrictive terms of the agreements. The respondents urge that jjdicial enforcement of private agreements does not amount to state action; or, in any event, the participation of the State is so attenuated in character as not to amount to state action within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. Finally, it is suggested, even if the States in these cases may be deemed to have acted in the constitutional sense, their action did not deprive petitioners of rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. We move to a consideration of these matters.\n\nII.\n\n28\nThat the action of state courts and of judicial officers in their official capacities is to be regarded as action of the State within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, is a proposition which has long been established by decisions of this Court. That principle was given expression in the earliest cases involving the construction of the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, in Commonwealth of Virginia v. Rives, 1880, 100 U.S. 313, 318, 25 L.Ed. 667, this Court stated: 'It is doubtless true that a State may act through different agencies,\u2014either by its legislative, its executive, or its judicial authorities; and the prohibitions of the amendment extend to all action of the State denying equal protection of the laws, whether it be action by one of these agencies or by another.' In Ex parte Commonwealth of Virginia, 1880, 100 U.S. 339, 347, 25 L.Ed. 676, the Court observed: 'A State acts by its legislative, its executive, or its judicial authorities. It can act in no other way.' In the Civil Rights Cases, 1883, 109 U.S. 3, 11, 17, 3 S.Ct. 18, 21, 27 L.Ed. 835, this Court pointed out that the Amendment makes void 'state action of every kind' which is inconsistent with the guaranties therein contained, and extends to manifestations of 'state authority in the shape of laws, customs, or judicial or executive proceedings.' Language to like effect is employed no less than eighteen times during the course of that opinion.13\n\n\n29\nSimilar expressions, giving specific recognition to the fact that judicial action is to be regarded as action on the State for the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, are to be found in numerous cases which have been more recently decided. In Twining v. New Jersey, 1908, 211 U.S. 78, 90, 91, 29 S.Ct. 14, 16, 53 L.Ed. 97, the Court said: 'The judicial act of the highest court of the state, in authoritatively construing and enforcing its laws, is the act of the state.' In Brinkerhoff\u2014Faris Trust & Savings Co. v. Hill, 1930, 281 U.S. 673, 680, 50 S.Ct. 451, 454, 74 L.Ed. 1107, the Court, through Mr. Justice Brandeis, stated: 'The federal guaranty of due process extends to state action through its judicial as well as through its legislative, executive, or administrative branch of government.' Further examples of such declarations in the opinions of this Court are not lacking.14\n\n\n30\nOne of the earliest applications of the prohibitions contained in the Fourteenth Amendment to action of state judicial officials occurred in cases in which Negroes had been excluded from jury service in criminal prosecutions by reason of their race or color. These cases demonstrate, also, the early recognition by this Court that state action in violation of the Amendment's provisions is equally repugnant to the constitutional commands whether directed by state statute or taken by a judicial official in the absence of statute. Thus, in Strauder v. West Virginia, 1880, 100 U.S. 303, 25 L.Ed. 664, this Court declared invalid a state statute restricting jury service to white persons as amounting to a denial of the equal protection of the laws to the colored defendant in that case. In the notice and opportunity to defend, has, Ex parte Virginia, supra, held that a similar discrimination imposed by the action of a state judge denied rights protected by the Amendment, despite the fact that the language of the state statute relating to jury service contained no such restrictions.\n\n\n31\nThe action of state courts in imposing penalties or depriving parties of other substantive rights without providing adequate notice and opportunity to defen, has, of course, long been regarded as a denial of the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Brinkerhoff-Faris Trust & Savings Co. v. Hill, supra. Cf. Pennoyer v. Neff, 1878, 95 U.S. 714, 24 L.Ed. 565.15\n\n\n32\nIn numerous cases, this Court has reversed criminal convictions in state courts for failure of those courts to provide the essential ingredients of a fair hearing. Thus it has been held that convictions obtained in state courts under the domination of a mob are void. Moore v. Dempsey, 1923, 261 U.S. 86, 43 S.Ct. 265, 67 L.Ed. 543. And see Frank v. Mangum, 1915, 237 U.S. 309, 35 S.Ct. 582, 59 L.Ed. 969. Convictions obtained by coerced confessions,16 by the use of perjured testimony known by the prosecution to be such,17 or without the effective assistance of counsel,18 have also been held to be exertions of state authority in conflict with the fundamental rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n33\nBut the examples of state judicial action which have been held by this Court to violate the Amendment's commands are not restricted to situations in which the judicial proceedings were found in some manner to be procedurally unfair. It has been recognized that the action of state courts in enforcing a substantive common-law rule formulated by those courts, may result in the denial of rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, even though the judicial proceedings in such cases may have been in complete accord with the most rigorous conceptions of procedural due process.19 Thus, in American Federation of Labor v. Swing, 1941, 312 U.S. 321, 61 S.Ct. 568, 85 L.Ed. 855, enforcement by state courts of the common-law policy of the State, which resulted in the restraining of peaceful picketing, was held to be state action of the sort prohibited by the Amendment's guaranties of freedom of discussion.20 In Cantwell v. Connecticut, 1940, 310 U.S. 296, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213, 128 A.L.R. 1352, a conviction in a state court of the common-law crime of breach of the peace was, under the circumstances of the case, found to be a violation of the Amendment's commonds relating to freedom of religion. In Bridges v. California, 1941, 314 U.S. 252, 62 S.Ct. 190, 86 L.Ed. 192, 159 A.L.R. 1346, enforcement of the state's common-law rule relating to contempts by publication was held to be state action inconsistent with the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment.21 And cf. Chicago, B. & Q.R. Co. v. Chicago, 1897, 166 U.S. 226, 17 S.Ct. 581, 41 L.Ed. 979.\n\n\n34\nThe short of the matter is that from the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment until the present, it has been the consistent ruling of this Court that the action of the States to which the Amendment has reference, includes action of state courts and state judicial officials. Although, in construing the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment, differences have from time to time been expressed as to whether particular types of state action may be said to offend the Amendment's prohibitory provisions, it has never been suggested that state court action is immunized from the operation of those provisions simply because the act is that of the judicial branch of the state government.\n\nIII.\n\n35\nAgainst this background of judicial construction, extending over a period of some three-quarters of a century, we are called upon to consider whether enforcement by state courts of the restrictive agreements in these cases may be deemed to be the acts of those States; and, if so, whether that action has denied these petitioners the equal protection of the laws which the Amendment was intended to insure.\n\n\n36\nWe have no doubt that there has been state action in these cases in the full and complete sense of the phrase. The undisputed facts disclose that petitioners were willing purchasers of properties upon which they desired to establish homes. The owners of the properties were willing sellers; and contracts of sale were accordingly consummated. It is clear that but for the active intervention of the state courts, supported by the full panoply of state power, petitioners would have been free to occupy the properties in question without restraint.\n\n\n37\nThese are not cases, as has been suggested, in which the States have merely abstained from action, leaving private individuals free to impose such discriminations as theys ee fit. Rather, these are cases in which the States have made available to such individuals the full coercive power of government to deny to petitioners, on the grounds of race or color, the enjoyment of property rights in premises which petitioners are willing and financially able to acquire and which the grantors are willing to sell. The difference between judicial enforcement and nonenforcement of the restrictive covenants is the difference to petitioners between being denied rights of property available to other members of the community and being accorded full enjoyment of those rights on an equal footing.\n\n\n38\nThe enforcement of the restrictive agreements by the state courts courts in these cases was directed pursuant to the common-law policy of the States as formulated by those courts in earlier decisions.22 In the Missouri case, enforcement of the covenant was directed in the first instance by the highest court of the State after the trial court had determined the agreement to be invalid for want of the requisite number of signatures. In the Michigan case, the order of enforcement by the trial court was affirmed by the highest state court.23 The judicial action in each case bears the clear and unmistakable imprimatur of the State. We have noted that previous decisions of this Court have established the proposition that judicial action is not immunized from the operation of the Fourteenth Amendment simply because it is taken pursuant to the state's common-law policy.24 Nor is the Amendment ineffective simply because the particular pattern of discrimination, which the State has enforced, was defined initially by the terms of a private agreement. State action, as that phrase is understood for the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, refers to exertions of state power in all forms. And when the effect of that action is to deny rights subject to the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is the obligation of this Court to enforce the constitutional commands.\n\n\n39\nWe hold that in granting judicial enforcement of the restrictive agreements in these cases, the States have denied petitioners the equal protection of the laws and that, therefore, the action of the state courts cannot stand. We have noted that freedom from discrimination by the States in the enjoyment of property rights was among the basic objectives sought to be effectuated by the framers of theFourteenth Amendment. That such discrimination has occurred in these cases is clear. Because of the race or color of these petitioners they have been denied rights of ownership or occupancy enjoyed as a matter of course by other citizens of different race or color.25 The Fourteenth Amendment declares 'that all persons, whether colored or white, shall stand equal before the laws of the States, and, in regard to the colored race, for whose protection the amendment was primarily designed, that no discrimination shall be made against them by law because of their color.'26 Strauder v. West Virginia, supra, 100 U.S. at 307, 25 L.Ed. 664. Only recently this Court has had occasion to declare that a state law which denied equal enjoyment of property rights to a designated class of citizens of specified race and ancestry, was not a legitimate exercise of the state's police power but violated the guaranty of the equal protectin  of the laws. Oyama v. California, 1948, 332 U.S. 633, 68 S.Ct. 269. Nor may the discriminations imposed by the state courts in these cases be justified as proper exertions of state police power.27 Cf. Buchanan v. Warley, supra.\n\n\n40\nRespondents urge, however, that since the state courts stand ready to enforce restrictive covenants excluding white persons from the ownership or occupancy of property covered by such agreements, enforcement of covenants excluding colored persons may not be deemed a denial of equal protection of the laws to the colored persons who are thereby affected.28 This contention does not bear scrutiny. The parties have directed our attention to no case in which a court, state or federal, has been called upon to enforce a covenant excluding members of the white majority from ownership or occupancy of real property on grounds of race or color. But there are more fundamental considerations. The rights ceated by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment are, by its terms, guaranteed to the individual. The rights established are personal rights.29 It is, therefore, no answer to these petitioners to say that the courts may also be induced to deny white persons rights of ownership and occupancy on grounds of race or color. Equal protection of the laws is not achieved through indiscriminate imposition of inequalities.\n\n\n41\nNor do we find merit in the suggestion that property owners who are parties to these agreements are denied equal protection of the laws if denied access to the courts to enforce the terms of restrictive covenants and to assert property rights which the state courts have held to be created by such agreements. The Constitution confers upon no individual the right to demand action by the State which results in the denial of equal protection of the laws to other individuals. And it would appear beyond question that the power of the State to create and enforce property interests must be exercised within the boundaries defined by the Fourteenth Amendment. Cf. Marsh v. Alabama, 1946, 326 U.S. 501, 66 S.Ct. 276, 90 L.Ed. 265.\n\n\n42\nThe problem of defining the scope of the restrictions which the Federal Constitution imposes upon exertions of power by the States has given rise to many of the most persistent and fundamental issues which this Court has been called upon to consider. That problem was foremost in the minds of the framers of the Constitution, and since that early day, has arisen in a multitude of forms. The task of determining whether the action of a State offends constitutional provisions is one which may not be undertaken lightly. Where, however, it is clear that the action of the State violt es the terms of the fundamental charter, it is the obligation of this Court so to declare.\n\n\n43\nThe historical context in which the Fourteenth Amendment became a part of the Constitution should not be forgotten. Whatever else the framers sought to achieve, it is clear that the matter of primary concern was the establishment of equality in the enjoyment of basic civil and political rights and the preservation of those rights from discriminatory action on the part of the States based on considerations of race or color. Seventy-five years ago this Court announced that the provisions of the Amendment are to be construed with this fundamental purpose in mind.30 Upon full consideration, we have concluded that in these cases the States have acted to deny petitioners the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Having so decided, we find it unnecessary to consider whether petitioners have also been deprived of property without due process of law or denied privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States.\n\n\n44\nFor the reasons stated, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missuri and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Michigan must be reversed.\n\n\n45\nReversed.\n\n\n46\nMr. Justice REED, Mr. Justice JACKSON, and Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\n\n\n1\n The trial court found that title to the property which petitioners Shelley sought to purchase was held by one Bishop, a real estate dealer, who placed the property in the name of Josephine Fitzgerald. Bishop, who acted as agent for petitioners in the purchase, concealed the fact of his ownership.\n\n\n2\n Kraemer v. Shelley, 1946, 355 Mo. 814, 198 S.W.2d 679.\n\n\n3\n Sipes v.

No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.'\n\n\n5\n Corrigan v.

{"text":"367 U.S. 556\n81 S.Ct. 1720\n6 L.Ed.2d 1028\nArmando PIEMONTE, Petitioner,v.UNITED STATES.\nNo. 122.\nArgued March 21, 1961.\nDecided June 19, 1961.\n\nMr. Melvin B. Lewis, Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\nMr. Theodore George Gilinsky, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nMr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner, Armando Piemonte, while serving a six-year sentence for the sale and possession of heroin, was brought by writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum before a federal grand jury inquiring into narcotics offenses. Having consulted his counsel prior to his appearance, before the grand jury he refused to answer all questions concerning his crime as well as other transactions in narcotics, under the claim of his privilege against self-incrimination. Three days later, the United States Attorney petitioned for an order directing Piemonte to answer the questions put to him. The petition stated that the grand jury was conducting an investigation of illegal narcotics activities, that Piemonte's testimony was required for the investigation in the public interest, that having been questioned on matters relating to narcotics Piemonte claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, wherefore request was made that Piemonte be required to testify pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1406. That provision of the Narcotic Control Act of 1956 gives immunity from future prosecution to any witness who is compelled by court order to testify before a federal court or grand jury concerning violations of the narcotics laws.1\n\n\n2\nThe section's breadth and constitutionality were considered earlier this Term in Reina v. United States, 364 U.S. 507, 81 S.Ct. 260, 5 L.Ed.2d 249.\n\n\n3\nThe district judge, having granted Piemonte immunity from 'prosecution which might arise from any answers that you give to this Grand Jury concerning the matter of their investigation,' ordered him to testify 'relative to the aforementioned inquiry of said Grand Jury * * *.' Piemonte was granted an opportunity to consult his lawyer and his duty to appear before the grand jury was delayed for a day. The next morning he renewed his refusal to answer the questions propounded to him about narcotics activities and again invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege.\n\n\n4\nThat afternoon he was taken back before the District Court to answer an order to show cause why he should not be cited for contempt for deliberately disobeying the previous order to testify. He was represented by his counsel at this proceeding. Having examined the transcript of the grand jury's morning proceedings, the judge asked petitioner if he persisted in refusing to answer the questions, to which Piemonte replied in the affirmative. The judge gave Piemonte's counsel four days to prepare for a plenary hearing of the charge of contumacy, but denied Piemonte's motion for a jury trial.\n\n\n5\nAt the subsequent hearing, the Government stood on its case based on the grand jury transcripts and the court's order to testify. The judge again asked Piemonte if he persisted in his refusal to obey the court's order. Piemonte took the stand in his own behalf, and made the following explanation for his refusal to testify:\n\n\n6\n'Well. I am doing time in the penitentiary. I fear for my      life. I fear for the life of my wife, my two stepchildren,      and my family. I can't do something like that. I want to      live, too.'\n\n\n7\nAfter his counsel's elaboration of this argument, the judge again asked Piemonte if he would testify. Upon his refusal, the judge declared him guilty of contempt of court for willful failure to obey a lawful order. After hearing argument on the sentence, the judge once again offered to give petitioner the opportunity to answer the questions. The refusal having been made definitive, sentence was fixed at eighteen months, to commence at the termination of the imprisonment he was serving.\n\n\n8\nThe contempt judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, 276 F.2d 148, and we granted certiorari 364 U.S. 811, 81 S.Ct. 46, 5 L.Ed.2d 44.\n\n\n9\nThis record surely evinces the utmost solicitude by the trial court for the defendant's interests. His only claim for reversal here is based upon alleged defects in the proceedings which resulted in his conviction of criminal contempt.2\n\n\n10\nPetitioner's first claim is that he was subjected to so many differing interpretations of whether he had a privilege to refrain from testifying as to certain questions that the order commanding him to answer lacked sufficient clarity. This is a sheer afterthought. Neither Piemonte nor his counsel ever claimed confusion in the District Court as a basis for his refusal to testify. Nor do the facts reveal that petitioner could have been misled by the out-of-context statements he pieces together for purposes of review.\n\n\n11\nThe first morning before the grand jury, the government attorney asked petitioner:\n\n\n12\n'Didn't your lawyer advise you, Mr. Piemonte, on those      matters that you pleaded guilty to in the indictment that you      have no Constitutional privilege against self-incrimination?'\n\n\n13\nHowever, the Government, in order to avoid any argumentative opportunities as to the scope of the area for which it sought immunity, did not attempt to secure an order directing answers for the particular questions relating to matters involved in his former conviction. It requested a broad order of immunity to cover the entire scope of what was under investigation by the grand jury. The United States Attorney told the district judge in seeking the order compelling testimony:\n\n\n14\n'(S)o that the Court would not have any misconception of the      idea of the Government counsel on this matter, we, too, think      that the constitutional privilege claimed by the witness is      well taken in this matter.'\n\n\n15\nPetitioner plainly must have known\u2014and gave every indication that he knew\u2014that he was required to answer all questions put to him by the grand jury in return for equivalent, compensating immunity. We find no merit in an argument which is contradicted by petitioner's own assertion, supported by his counsel's argument, that he refused to testify solely because of fear.\n\n\n16\nSecondly, petitioner argues that the oral grant of immunity by the district judge was null and void, because the judge said 'this Court now grants you immunity from prosecution * * *' and 'I now grant you immunity from such prosecution * * *,' when in reality the statute, not the court, grants the immunity. The puerility of this contention is emphasized by petitioner's disregard of the judge's introductory basis of his pronouncement as 'in accordance with the provisions of the Narcotic Control Act.'\n\n\n17\nThe remaining contentions of petitioner are of even less substantiality, and accordingly the judgment below is affirmed.\n\n\n18\nAffirmed.\n\n\n19\nMr. Chief Justice WARREN, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS concurs, dissenting.\n\n\n20\nThis case represents another long step in the constantly expanding use by the federal district judges of their summary contempt power to mete out severe prison sentences without according the defendants the benefit of a jury trial and the other rights guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.1 In an ordinary case of this nature, I would content myself with saying that the conviction should be reversed on the ground that a federal district judge has no power to impose such punishment in a summary proceeding. See Green v. United States, 356 U.S. 165, 193, 78 S.Ct. 632, 648, 2 L.Ed.2d 672 (dissenting opinion); Reina v. United States, 364 U.S. 507, 515, 81 S.Ct. 260, 265, 5 L.Ed.2d 249 (dissenting opinion). However, the facts of this case are so disquieting that I am compelled to add a few adi tional comments.\n\n\n21\nIn 1958, the petitioner was convicted of selling and possessing narcotics in violation of the federal narcotics laws and was sentenced by a Federal District Court to six years' imprisonment. In 1959, while serving his sentence at the Leavenworth Penitentiary, the petitioner was subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury conducting an investigation of possible narcotics offenses. He was asked to indicate where he had obtained the narcotics which he was convicted of having possessed and sold. Invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, the petitioner refused to answer the question.2 He was then asked whether he knew several named individuals and whether he had obtained the narcotics from any of those individuals. Still relying upon his Fifth Amendment privilege, the petitioner refused to answer each of the questions. On petition of the Government, the District Court authorized the granting of immunity to the petitioner pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1406, and instructed him to answer the questions asked by the grand jury. Upon being recalled before the grand jury, the petitioner again invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to identify those from whom he had obtained the narcotics which constituted the basis for his 1958 conviction.3 In response to a subsequent order to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court, the petitioner asserted, as an additional reason for not answering, that the lives of his wife and children, as well as his own life, would be endangered were he to answer the questions. Having denied the petitioner's request for a jury trial, the district judge summarily found the petitioner guilty of contempt of court and sentenced him to eighteen months' imprisonment, to be served after the completion of the six-year sentence imposed in 1958.\n\n\n22\nIn my opinion, the Government has subjected the petitioner to unjustifiable harassment. The petitioner has been convicted for his admittedly illegal conduct and is presently paying his debt to society for that conduct. However, not being satisfied with this punishment, the Government sought to extract from the petitioner, under the threat of a contempt conviction, testimony which it could not have compelled at the original trial in 1958, and which it knows might well endanger petitioner's life and the lives of his loved ones. In my view, the Government's attempt to compel the petitioner to testify about conduct for which he has already been punished, and the District Court's imposition of an additional term in the penitentiary for petitioner's refusal to testify about such conduct represents the type of harassment which violates the spirit of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Cf. Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S. 187, 196, 79 S.Ct. 666, 671, 3 L.Ed.2d 729 (separate opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan); Ciucci v. State of Illinois, 356 U.S. 571, 573, 78 S.Ct. 839, 840, 2 L.Ed.2d 983 (dissenting opinion). I think it can fairly be said that the treatment which the petitioner has received from the Government and the District Court falls far short of that fundamental fairness which the Constitution guarantees and to which even the basest prisoner in the penitentiary is entitled.4 Therefore, even if the Court is unwilling to recognize that the Constitution prohibits the imposition of punishment in a summary proceeding, it ought to exercise its supervisory power over the lower federal courts to rectify the abuse of the summary contempt power which the record in this case makes manifest. See Offutt v. United States, 348 U.S. 11, 75 S.Ct. 11, 99 L.Ed. 11.\n\n\n23\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK concurs, dissenting.\n\n\n24\nPetitioner, while a prisoner in a federal penitentiary serving a six-year sentence on a narcotics conviction, was summoned before a grand jury and interrogated about transactions in narcotics.\n\nI.\n\n25\nOne series of questions was opened with the following: 'Mr. Piemonte, were you in the narcotics business in 1954?' Following the tender of immunity, petitioner was again asked a series of questions, some of them relating to transactions in narcotics in that year. Among the questions was the following: 'Have you supplied Jeremiah Pullings with any heroin?'\n\n\n26\nThese questions and these refusals to answer were on August 10 and 14, 1959. The sentence for contempt was imposed on August 18, 1959. After that date and before February 29, 1960, the date when the Court of Appeals affirmed the appeal, the grand jury returned another indictment against petitioner. This was on September 2, 1959. This indictment charged petitioner and others with a conspiracy to buy and sell narcotics commencing in August 1954. One of the overt acts charged was a conversation in 1955 between Jeremiah Pullings and one of petitioner's co-conspirators under the September 2, 1959, indictment. These 1954 and 1955 transactions, for which petitioner now stands indicted, were ones on which he refused to testify and for which he has been committed for contempt.\n\n\n27\nOnce an indictment was returned, the proceedings of this grand jury became a part of a criminal prosecution directed against petitioner. Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 562, 12 S.Ct. 195, 197, 35 L.Ed. 1110; United States v. Monia, 317 U.S. 424, 427, 63 S.Ct. 409, 410, 87 L.Ed. 376. When the citizen is formally accused by indictment, he has a constitutional right to stand mute and to refuse to testify. His right not to take the stand in a federal criminal trial transcends his privilege against self-incrimination. No immunity statute, no pressure of government, no threats of the prosecution can be used to deprive the citizen of this right. See Wilson v. United States, 149 U.S. 60, 13 S.Ct. 765, 37 L.Ed. 650; Stewart v. United States, 366 U.S. 1, 81 S.Ct. 941, 6 L.Ed.2d 84. And it is unthinkable that a district judge would ever hold a defendant in contempt because he refused to take the stand at his own trial. The district judge did no such thing here. But that was the posture of the case when it was decided by the Court of Appeals. For by then the matters about which petitioner refused to answer had become in form and in effect an indictment against him.\n\n\n28\nThere is no power in our free society to compel a person to talk about a matter on which he has been indicted or to penalize him for failure to do so. We might as well say that an accused can be committed for contempt for failure to take the stand at his own trial.\n\n\n29\nWe are advised that after we granted certiorari the indictment against petitioner was dismissed on motion of the Government for lack of evidence. That seems irrelevant. The truth is that the grand jury before which petitioner was summoned did indict him. Petitioner was in fact held in contempt for refusal to testify in a criminal proceeding against him. That is not permissible under the procedures of our free society, whatever may have been the ultimate fate of that criminal proceeding.\n\nII.\n\n30\nI think the imposition of an eighteen months' sentence was beyond the power of a federal court in a summary proceeding. That was the view stated by Mr. Justice Black in his dissenting opinion in Green v. United States, 356 U.S. 165, 193, 78 S.Ct. 632, 648, 2 L.Ed.2d 672, with which I agreed then and still agree. There is nothing I can find in the Constitution which permits those who defy a court's decree to be tried in one way and those who defy a mandate of the Congress1 or an order of the Executive2 to be tried in another way. Whatever the criminal charge may be, an accused is entitled to the protections afforded by the Constitution\u2014indictment by a grand jury and trial before a petit jury which sits to determine guilt. Determination of guilt by a judge, without these safeguards interposed between the accused and government, marks a continuing erosion of civil rights. The evil is compounded here by reason of the fact that contempt is used to increase a punishment already imposed for an offense as respects which no second indictment could ever be returned. Criminal contempt is used to undermine not only the guarantees of an indictment by a grand jury and a trial by one's peers but also to destroy the protection of double jeopardy.\n\n\n31\nPlainly this judgment of conviction should not stand.\n\n\n\n1\n 'Whenever in the judgment of a United States attorney the testimony of any witness, or the production of books, papers, or other evidence by any witness, in any case or proceeding before any grand jury or court of the United States involving any violation of\u2014\n'(1) any provision of part I or part II of subchapter A of chapter 39 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 the penalty for which is provided in subsection (a) or (b) of section 7237 of such Code,\n'(2) subsection (c), (h), or (i) of section 2 of the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act, as amended (21 U.S.C., sec. 174), or\n'(3) the Act of July 11, 1941, as amended (21 U.S.C., sec. 184a), is necessary to the public interest, he, upon the approval of the Attorney General, shall make application to the court that the witness shall be instructed to testify or produce evidence subject to the provisions of h is section, and upon order of the court such witness shall not be excused from testifying or from producing books, papers, or other evidence on the ground that the testimony or evidence required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture. But no such witness shall be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he is compelled after having claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence, nor shall testimony so compelled be used as evidence in any criminal proceeding (except prosecution described in the next sentence) against him in any court. No witness shall be exempt under this section from prosecution for perjury or contempt committed while giving testimony or producing evidence under compulsion as provided in this section.'\n\n\n2\n Neither before the Court of Appeals nor here was fear for himself or his family urged by Piemonte as a valid excuse from testifying. Nor would this be a legal excuse. Every citizen of course owes to his society the duty of giving testimony to aid in the enforcement of the law. See Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591, 600, 16 S.Ct. 644, 648, 40 L.Ed. 819. Lord Chancellor Hardwicke's pithy phrase cano t be too often recalled: '(T)he public has a right to every man's evidence.' 12 Hansard's Debates 693; 8 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.), p. 64, \u00a7 2192.\nIf two persons witness an offense\u2014one being an innocent bystander and the other an accomplice who is thereafter imprisoned for his participation\u2014the latter has no more right to keep silent than the former. The Government of course has an obligation to protect is citizens from harm. But fear of reprisal offers an immunized prisoner no more dispensation from testifying than it does any innocent bystander without a record.\n\n\n1\n Only in the last few years has it become the fashion for district judges to use the summary contempt power as a device for imposing long terms of imprisonment. See, e.g., Reina v. United States, 364 U.S. 507, 81 S.Ct. 260, 5 L.Ed.2d 249 (two years' imprisonment); Brown v. United States, 359 U.S. 41, 79 S.Ct. 539, 3 L.Ed.2d 609 (fifteen months' imprisonment); Green v. United States, 356 U.S. 165, 78 S.Ct. 632, 2 L.Ed.2d 672 (three years' imprisonment); Collins v. United States, 9 Cir., 269 F.2d 745 (three years' imprisonment); Tedesco v. United States, 6 Cir., 255 F.2d 35 (two years' imprisonment); Corona v. United States, 6 Cir., 250 F.2d 578 (two years' imprisonment). Prior to this recent trend, the summary contempt power was seldom used to impose more than a nominal fine or a short term of imprisonment. See Brown v. United States, supra, 359 U.S. at pages 58\u201459, 79 S.Ct. at pages 550\u2014551 (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n2\n 'Q. You are now incarcerated in the penitentiary, are you not, Mr. Piemonte? A.

Gen., for respondent.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nPetitioners, two Negroes, approached the Plantation Restaurant in the company of 35 to 40 other Negroes. This restaurant served whites only and carried a sign to that offect on its front door. Pursuant to this policy the owner of the restaurant locked the door against the Negroes, though from time to time he would open the door to admit white customers and relock it after they had entered. The restaurant was some 60 feet from the highway, the property between the restaurant and the highway being owned by the restaurant proprietor. The Negroes waited outside the door, some on a shrubbery box six or eight feet away, others up to 15 feet distant. The owner asked the Negroes to leave; but they continued to wait quietly outside until they were arrested. For this conduct petitioners were indicted and convicted for violation of \u00a7 14\u2014134 of the North Carolina General Statutes, making it an offense to 'go or enter upon the lands of another, without a license therefor' and 'after being forbidden to do so.' The Supreme Court of North Carolina affirmed petitioners' convictions on March 18, 1964. 261 N.C. 463, 135 S.E.2d 14; 261 N.C. 467, 135 S.E.2d 17.\n\n\n2\nThe Plantation Restaurant is situated on Interstate Highway 301 in the town of Enfield, North Carolina. Adjoining the restaurant and owned by the same person is the Enfield Motel. The restaurant's menu and other advertising are posted in the rooms of this motel. The Plantation Restaurant and Enfield Motel are advertised on billboards for some miles up and down Highway 301. They are further advertised on the radio and in the newspapers.\n\n\n3\nSince these facts make it clear that the Plantation Restaurant 'serves or offers to serve interstate travelers,' it must be held that the restaurant is a 'place of public accommodation' within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 201(b)(2) and (c)(2) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\n\n4\n'The Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids discrimination in places of public accommodation and removes peaceful attempts to be served on an equal basis from the category of punishable activities. Although the conduct in the present cases occurred prior to the enactment of the Act, the still-pending convictions are abated by its passage.' Hamm v.

IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE.\nNos. 40 and 80.\nArgued Nov. 16 and 17, 1966.\nDecided Dec. 12, 1966.\n\nJacob A. Myers, Dayton, Ohio, for petitioner, Woodby.\nJoseph Forer, Washington, D.C., for petitioner, Sherman.\nFrancis X. Beytagh, Jr., Cleveland, Ohio, pro hac vice, by special leave of Court, Charles Gordon, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nMr. Justice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe question presented by these cases is what burden of proof the Government must sustain in deportation proceedings. We have concluded that it is incumbent upon the Government in such proceedings to establish the facts supporting deportability by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence.\n\n\n2\nIn Sherman (No. 80), the petitioner is a resident alien who entered this country from Poland in 1920 as a 14-year-old boy. In 1963 the Immigration and Naturalization Service instituted proceedings to deport him upon the ground that he had re-entered the United States in 1938, following a trip abroad, without inspection as an alien.1 After a hearing before a special inquiry officer, the petitioner was ordered to be deported, and the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed his appeal.2\n\n\n3\nThe Government's evidence showed that the petitioner had obtained a passport in 1937 under the name of Samuel Levine, representing himself as a United States citizen. Someone using this passport sailed to France in June 1937, proceeded to Spain, returned to the United States in December 1938, aboard the S.S. Ausonia, and was admitted without being examined as an alien. To establish that it was the petitioner who had traveled under this passport, the Government introduced the testimony of Edward Morrow, an American citizen who had fought in the Spanish Civil War. Morrow was at first unable to remember the name Samuel Levine or identify the petitioner, but eventually stated that he thought he had known the petitioner as 'Sam Levine,' had seen him while fighting for the Loyalists in Spain during 1937 and 1938, and had returned with him to the United States aboard the S.S. Ausonia in December 1938. Morrow conceded that his recollection of events occurring 27 years earlier was imperfect, and admitted that his identification of the petitioner might be mistaken.\n\n\n4\nIt is not clear what standard of proof the special inquiry officer and the Board of Immigration Appeals on de novo review applied in determining that it was the petitioner who had traveled to Spain and re-entered the United States under the Samuel Levine passport. At the outset of his opinion, the special inquiry officer stated that the Government must establish deportability 'by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence,' without discussing what the burden of proof was. Later he concluded that the Government had established its contentions 'with a solidarity far greater than required,' but did not further elucidate what was 'required.' The Board of Immigration Appeals stated that it was 'established beyond any reasonable doubt' that the petitioner had obtained the Samuel Levine passport, and added that this established a 'presumption' that the petitioner had used it to travel abroad. The Board further stated that it was a 'most unlikely hypothesis' that someone other than the petitioner had obtained and used the passport, and asserted that 'the Service has borne its burden of establishing' that the petitioner was deportable, without indicating what it considered the weight of that burden to be.\n\n\n5\nUpon petition for review, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit originally set aside the deportation order, upon the ground that the Government has the burden of proving the facts supporting deportability beyond a reasonable doubt.3 The court reversed itself, however, upon a rehearing en banc, holding that the Government need only prove its case with 'reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence.'4 We granted certiorari, 384 U.S. 904, 86 S.Ct. 1345, 16 L.Ed.2d 357.\n\n\n6\nIn Woodby (No. 40), the petitioner is a resident alien who was born in Hungary and entered the United States from Germany in 1956 as the wife of an American soldier. Deportation proceedings were instituted against her on the ground that she had engaged in prostitution after entry.5 A special inquiry officer and the Board of Immigration Appeals found that she was deportable upon the ground charged.\n\n\n7\nAt the administrative hearing the petitioner admitted that she had engaged in prostitution for a brief period in 1957, some months after her husband had deserted her, but claimed that her conduct was the product of circumstances amounting to duress. Without reaching the validity of the duress defense, the special inquiry officer and the Board of Immigration Appeals concluded that the petitioner had continued to engage in prostitution after the alleged duress had terminated. The hearing officer and the Board did not discuss what burden of proof the Government was required to bear in establishing deportability, nor did either of them indicate the degree of certainty with which their factual conclusions were reached. The special inquiry officer merely asserted that the evidence demonstrated that the petitioner was deportable. The Board stated that the evidence made it 'apparent' that the petitioner had engaged in prostitution after the alleged duress had ended, and announced that 'it is concluded that the evidence establishes deportability * * *.'\n\n\n8\nIn denying a petition for review, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit did not explicitly deal with the issue of what burden of persuasion was imposed upon the Government at the administrative level, finding only that 'the Board's underlying order is 'supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole * * *.\" We granted certiorari, 384 U.S. 904, 86 S.Ct. 1345, 16 L.Ed.2d 357.\n\n\n9\nIn the prevailing opinion in the Sherman case, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stated that '(i)f the slate were clean,' it 'might well agree that the standard of persuasion for deportation should be similar to that in denaturalization, where the Supreme Court has insisted that the evidence must be 'clear, unequivocal, and convincing' and that the Government needs 'more than a bare preponderance of the evidence' to prevail. * * * But here,' the court thought, 'Congress has spoken * * *.' 350 F.2d at 900. This view was based upon two provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act which use the language 'reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence' in connection with deportation orders. The provisions in question are \u00a7 106(a)(4) of the Act which states that a deportation order, 'if supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive,'6 and \u00a7 242(b)(4) of the Act which provides inter alia that 'no decision of deportability shall be valid unless it is based upon reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence.'7\n\n\n10\nIt seems clear, however, that these two statutory provisions are addressed not to the degree of proof required at the administrative level in deportation proceedings, but to quite a different subject\u2014the scope of judicial review. The elementary but crucial difference between burden of proof and scope of review is, of course, a commonplace in the law.8 The difference is most graphically illustrated in a criminal case. There the prosecution is generally required to prove the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.9 But if the correct burden of proof was imposed at the trial, judicial review is generally limited to ascertaining whether the evidence relied upon by the trier of fact was of sufficient quality and substantiality to support the rationality of the judgment. In other words, an appellate court in a criminal case ordinarily does not ask itself whether it believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether the judgment is supported by substantial evidence.10\n\n\n11\nThat \u00a7 106(a)(4) relates exclusively to judicial review is made abundantly clear by its language, its context, and its legislative history. Section 106 was added to the Act in 1961 in order 'to create a single, separate, statutory form of judicial review of administrative orders for the deportation and exclusion of aliens from the United States.'11 The section is entitled 'Judicial Review of Orders of Deportation and Exclusion,' and by its terms provides 'the sole and exclusive procedure for' the 'judicial review of all final orders of deportation.' Subsection 106(a)(4) is a specific directive to the courts in which petitions for review are filed.12\n\n\n12\nIt is hardly less clear that the other provision upon which the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit relied, \u00a7 242(b)(4) of the Act, is also addressed to reviewing courts, and, insofar as it represents a yardstick for the administrative factfinder, goes, not to the burden of proof, but rather to the quality and nature of the evidence upon which a deportation order must be based.13 The provision declares that 'reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence' shall be the measure of whether a deportability decision is 'valid'\u2014a word that implies scrutiny by a reviewing tribunal of a decision already reached by the trier of the facts. The location of this provision in a section containing provisions dealing with procedures before the special inquiry officer has little significance when it is remembered that the original 1952 Act did not itself contain a framework for judicial review\u2014although such review was, of course, available by habeas corpus or otherwise. See Marcello v. Bonds, 349 U.S. 302, 75 S.Ct. 757, 99 L.Ed. 1107. And whatever ambiguity might be thought to lie in the location of this section is resolved by its legislative history. The Senate Report explained \u00a7 242(b)(4) as follows: 'The requirement that the decision of the special inquiry officer shall be based on reasonable, substantial and probative evidence means that, where the decision rests upon evidence of such a nature that it cannot be said that a reasonable person might not have reached the conclusion which was reached, the case may not be reversed because the judgment of the appellate body differs from that of the administrative body.'14\n\n\n13\nWe conclude, therefore, that Congress has not addressed itself to the question of what degree of proof is required in deportation proceedings. It is the kind of question which has traditionally been left to the judiciary to resolve,15 and its resolution is necessary in the interest of the evenhanded administration of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\n\n14\nThe petitioners urge that the appropriate burden of proof in deportation proceedings should be that which the law imposes in criminal cases\u2014the duty of proving the essential facts beyond a reasonable doubt. The Government, on the other hand, points out that a deportation proceeding is not a criminal case, and that the appropriate burden of proof should consequently be the one generally imposed in civil cases and administrative proceedings\u2014the duty of prevailing by a mere preponderance of the evidence.\n\n\n15\nTo be sure, a deportation proceeding is not a criminal prosecution. Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 72 S.Ct. 512, 96 L.Ed. 586. But it does not syllogistically follow that a person may be banished from this country upon no higher degree of proof than applies in a negligence case. This Court has not closed its eyes to the drastic deprivations that may follow when a resident of this country is compelled by our Government to forsake all the bonds formed here and go to a foreign land where he often has no contemporary identification. In words apposite to the question before us, we have spoken of 'the solidity of proof that is required for a judgment entailing the consequences of deportation, particularly in the case of an old man who has lived in this country for forty years * * *.' Rowoldt v. Perfetto, 355 U.S. 115, 120, 78 S.Ct. 180, 183, 2 L.Ed.2d 140.\n\n\n16\nIn denaturalization cases the Court has required the Government to establish its allegations by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence.16 The same burden has been imposed in expatriation cases.17 That standard of proof is no stranger to the civil law.18\n\n\n17\nNo less a burden of proof is appropriate in deportation proceedings. The immediate hardship of deportation is often greater than that inflicted by denaturalization, which does not, immediately at least, result in expulsion from our shores. And many resident aliens have lived in this country longer and established stronger family, social, and economic ties here than some who have become naturalized citizens.\n\n\n18\nWe hold that no deportation order may be entered unless it is found by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the facts alleged as grounds for deportation are true.19 Accordingly, in each of the cases before us, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is set aside, and the case is remanded with directions to remand to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for such further proceedings as, consistent with this opinion, may be deemed appropriate.20\n\n\n19\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n20\nJudgment set aside and remanded.\n\n\n21\nMr. Justice CLARK, whom Mr. Justice HARLAN joins, dissenting.\n\n\n22\nThe Court, by placing a higher standard of proof on the Government, in deportation cases, has usurped the legislative function of the Congress and has in one fell swoop repealed the long-established 'reasonable, substantial, and probative' burden of proof placed on the Government by specific Act of the Congress, and substituted its own 'clear, unequivocal, and convincing' standard. This is but another case in a long line in which the Court has tightened the noose around the Government's neck in immigration cases.\n\nI.\n\n23\nI agree that \u00a7 106(a)(4), the 1961 amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, relates to judicial review of administrative orders of the Immigration Service but, with due deference, I cannot see how 'It is hardly less clear' that \u00a7 242(b)(4) of the Act, as the Court says, likewise applies exclusively to judicial review. Indeed, on the contrary, the latter section was specifically enacted as the only standard of proof to be applied in deportation cases.\n\n\n24\nBefore \u00a7 242(b) was enacted the immigration laws contained no detailed provision concerning the burden of proof in deportation cases. Kessler v. Strecker, 307 U.S. 22, 34, 59 S.Ct. 694, 700, 83 L.Ed. 1082 (1939). In Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U.S. 33, 70 S.Ct. 445, 94 L.Ed. 616 (1950), this Court extended the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act to deportation proceedings. Congress immediately exempted such proceedings from the Administrative Procedure Act and in 1952 established in \u00a7 242(b) an exclusive procedural system for deportation proceedings.\n\n\n25\nIn essence that section, \u00a7 242(b), provides for notice and a hearing before a 'special inquiry officer' of the Immigration Service; sets the standard of proof in such cases as 'reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence'; and authorizes the Attorney General to issue regulations. In issuing those regulations the Attorney General established a Board of Immigration Appeals. The Board's relationship to the orders of the special inquiry officer is similar to the relationship an agency has to the orders of a hearing examiner under the Administrative Procedure Act. The section also specifically provides that the regulations shall include requirements that 'no decision of deportability shall be valid unless it is based upon reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence' and that this standard shall be the 'sole and exclusive procedure for determining the deportability of an alien under this section.' This was the first time in our history that Congress had expressly placed a specific standard of proof on the Government in deportation cases. And the language Congress used made it clear that this standard related to the 'burden of proof' as well as 'the quality and nature of the evidence.' The requirement of 'reasonable' evidence cannot be meant merely to exclude 'unreasonable' or 'irrational' evidence but carries the obvious connotation from history and tradition of sufficiency to sustain a conclusion by a preponderance of the evidence.1 Congress in overruling Wong Yang Sung, supra, carved deportation proceedings from the judicial overtones of the Administrative Procedure Act and established a built-in administrative procedure.\n\n\n26\nThis is made crystal clear by the reports of both Houses of Congress on \u00a7 242(b). The Committee Reports, S.Rep. No. 1137, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 30; H.R.Rep. No. 1365, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 57, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1952, p. 1653, state in simple understandable language that:\n\n\n27\n'The requirement that the decision of the special inquiry      officer shall be based on reasonable, substantial, and      probative evidence means that, where the decision rests upon      evidence of such a nature that it cannot be said that a      reasonable person might not have reached the conclusion which      was reached, the case may not be reversed because the      judgment of the appellate body differs from that below.'\n\n\n28\nThe courts consistently applied the standard of 'reasonable, substantial and probative' evidence after the adoption of \u00a7 242(b). See, e.g., Rowoldt v. Perfetto, 355 U.S. 115, 120\u2014121, 78 S.Ct. 180, 183\u2014184, 2 L.Ed.2d 140 (1957).\n\n\n29\nThe Court, however, in Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U.S. 48, 75 S.Ct. 591, 99 L.Ed. 868 (1955), once again extended the Administrative Procedure Act's provision respecting judicial review to deportation cases. The reaction of the Congress was identical to that of 1952 when it overruled Wong Yang Sung, supra. It enacted, in 1961, \u00a7 106(a)(4) of the Act. Just as \u00a7 242(b) was the first statutory standard of proof, \u00a7 106(a)(4) was the first express statutory standard of judicial review. It provided:\n\n\n30\n'* * * the petition (for review) shall be determined solely      upon the administrative record upon which the deportation      order is based and the Attorney General's findings of fact, if supported by reasonable,      substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered      as a whole, shall be conclusive.'\n\n\n31\nWhy Congress passed \u00a7 106(a)(4) if judicial review, as the Court holds, was already exclusively covered by \u00a7 242(b) is beyond my comprehension\u2014unless it was engaged in shadow boxing. I cannot believe that it was.\n\n\n32\nThe Court says that both the special inquiry officer and the Board of Immigration Appeals failed to state what the burden of proof was in these cases. Fault is found in the officer's use of the phrase 'solidarity' of proof 'far greater than required.' This language was apparently patterned after this Court's opinion in Rowoldt, supra, where the phrase 'solidity of proof' was used. The findings of both the officers and the Board in these cases show specifically that the burden of proof followed in each case was that required of the Government in \u00a7 242(b) and the Regulations of the Attorney General, i.e., by 'reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence.' This standard has been administratively followed by the Immigration Service in a long and unbroken line of cases. See Matter of Peralta, 10 I. & N. Dec. 43, 46.\n\n\n33\nThe Court now extends the standard of Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U.S. 118, 63 S.Ct. 1333, 87 L.Ed. 1796 (1943), in denaturalization cases, i.e., 'clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence,' to deportation cases. But denaturalization and expatriation are much more oppressive cases than deportation. They deprive one of citizenship which the United States had previously conferred. The Schneiderman rule only follows the principle that vested rights can be canceled only upon clear, unequivocal, and convincing proof; it gives stability and finality to a most precious right-citizenship. An alien, however, does not enjoy citizenship but only a conditional privilege extended to him by the Congress as a matter of grace. Both petitioners, the record shows, knew this, yet they remained in this country for years\u201446 in the case of Sherman and 10 in that of Woodby. Still, neither made any effort to obtain citizenship.\n\nII.\n\n34\nBy treating these two cases as raising only a single issue the Court ignores some aspects of Woodby which greatly trouble me. Woodby sought review of the final deportation order against her more than six months after entry of that order. Section 106(a)(1) of the Act specifically limits the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to consideration of petitions for review 'filed not later than six months from the date of the final deportation order.' The legislative history of that provision makes it clear that Congress intended it to be strictly enforced in order to alleviate the spectacle of aliens subject to deportation orders and able to remain in this country for long periods of time by employing dilatory legal tactics. See H.R.Rep. No. 565, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. Since there is no time limit on petitions for rehearing or reconsideration, 8 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 242.22, 103.5, permitting review of a final order of deportation merely because a timely petition for review of an administrative refusal to reopen the proceedings has been filed would negate the congressional purpose behind the insistence on timely filing in \u00a7 106(a)(1). Lopez v. United States Department of Justice, Immigration & Naturalization Service, 3 Cir., 356 F.2d 986, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 839, 87 S.Ct. 88, 17 L.Ed.2d 73.2\n\n\n35\nThe Court holds only that 'no deportation order may be entered unless it is found by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the facts alleged as grounds for deportation are true.' (Italics added.) The ground alleged for deportation of Woodby was that she had 'engaged in prostitution after entry.' It has never been contended that this ground was not properly established. In fact it is conceded that Woodby engaged in prostitution. The only factual dispute involved in her case centers on the question whether her activities arose from duress and ended when the conditions compelling her to stray ceased to exist. It seems clear to me that since Woodby is raising duress as an affirmative defense she bears the burden of establishing all elements of that defense. See In the Matter of M\u2014, 7 I. & N. Dec. 251. And the record clearly shows that both the administrative authorities and the Court of Appeals rejected Woodby's 'bizarre' story. Under familiar principles those findings are binding on this Court, Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456, and nothing in what the Court holds today affects that conclusion.\n\n\n36\nI regret that my powers of persuasion with my Brethren are not sufficient to to prevent this encroachment upon the function of the Congress which will place an undue and unintended burden upon the Government in deportation cases. I dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n Section 241(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 204, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2), provides for deportation of any alien who 'entered the United States without inspection or at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General * * *.' Prior to 1952, the Government was required to bring deportation proceedings within five years of an alleged illegal entry, 39 Stat. 889 (1917), as amended 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(a) (1946 ed.). Thus, under the prior law, the petitioner would not have been subject to deportation proceedings commenced after 1943. However, this time limit was retroactively eliminated by the 1952 Act, \u00a7 241(d), 66 Stat. 208, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(d). See Developments in the Law, Immigration and Nationality, 66 Harv.L.Rev. 643, 683\u2014684.\n\n\n2\n In conformity with its usual practice, the Board made its own independent determination of the factual issues after de novo examination of the record.

Among the classes specified in \u00a7 212(a)(12) of the Act, 66 Stat. 182, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(12), are 'Aliens who are prostitutes or who have engaged in prostitution * * *.'\n\n\n6\n 75 Stat. 651 (1961), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4).\n\n\n7\n 66 Stat. 210 (1952), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4).\n\n\n8\n See Jaffe, Administrative Law: Burden of Proof and Scope of Review, 79 Harv.L.Rev. 914 (1966); Comment, 41 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 622 (1966); Standard of Proof in Deportation Proceedings, 18 Stan.L.Rev. 1237 (1966).\n\n\n9\n See McCormick, Evidence 681\u2014685 (1954); 9 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2497 (3d ed. 1940).\n\n\n10\n E.g., Rutkin v.

See 9 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2498 (3d ed. 1940).\n\n\n19\n This standard of proof applies to all deportation cases, regardless of the length of time the alien has resided in this country. It is perhaps worth pointing out, however, that, as a practical matter, the more recent the alleged events supporting deportability, the more readily the Government will generally be able to prove its allegations by clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence.\n\n\n20\n Section 106(a)(1) of the Act, 75 Stat. 651 (1961), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a) (1), provides that a petition for judicial review must be filed with the Court of Appeals not later than six months after a final order of deportation. In No. 40, Woodby, the petitioner's appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals was dismissed on March 8, 1963, and a motion for reconsideration was denied on May 27, 1963. Petition for review by the Court of Appeals was filed more than six months after the Board upheld the deportation order, but within six months after the denial of the motion to reconsider. The Court of Appeals did not pass on the question whether, in such circumstances, its power of review was limited to consideration whether the denial of the motion for reconsideration was an abuse of discretion, or whether it might also assess in full the validity of the deportation order. Following the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held, in similar circumstances, that it had authority to undertake full review of the deportation order, as well as the denial of the motion to reconsider. Bregman v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 351 F.2d 401. In light of the Bregman decision, the Government before this Court expressly abandoned its contention that in this case the courts are limited to reviewing the denial of the motion to reconsider. See the Government's brief in No. 40, Woodby, p. 8, n. 3.\n\n\n1\n Thus the judicial review provision of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1009(e)(5), limits the scope of review to a determination of support by 'substantial evidence,' and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1006 limits the agencies to acting on 'reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.' This pattern has traditionally been held satisfied when the agency decides on the preponderance of the evidence.\n\n\n2\n In Giova v. Rosenberg, 379 U.S. 18, 85 S.Ct. 156, 13 L.Ed.2d 90, this Court held only that denial of a petition to reopen or reconsider is reviewable. The Court did not specify the scope of review to be applied. The Court may be depending upon a concession by the Government on this point, but it is clear that jurisdiction cannot be waived. King Bridge Co. v. Otoe County, 120 U.S. 225, 7 S.Ct. 552, 30 L.Ed. 623; Good Shot v. United States, 179 U.S. 87, 21 S.Ct. 33, 45 L.Ed. 101.\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"429 U.S. 545\n97 S.Ct. 837\n51 L.Ed.2d 30\nJack M. WEATHERFORD, etc., et al., Petitioners,v.Brett Allen BURSEY.\nNo. 75-1510.\nArgued Dec. 7, 1976.\nDecided Feb. 22, 1977.\n\nSyllabus\nRespondent and petitioner Weatherford (hereinafter petitioner), an undercover agent, were arrested for a state criminal offense, each thereafter retaining separate counsel. Petitioner had two pretrial meetings with respondent and respondent's counsel, who had sought petitioner's presence for the purpose of securing information or suggestions as to respondent's defense. Petitioner had no discussions concerning respondent's trial strategy or the pending criminal action either with his superiors or with the prosecution. Petitioner (who had told respondent he would not be a prosecution witness) testified for the prosecution, which on the morning of the trial decided to call petitioner as a witness because he had been seen in the company of police officers and had thus lost effectiveness as an undercover agent. Respondent was convicted. After he had served his sentence, he brought this action against petitioner under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that petitioner's participation in the two meetings had deprived respondent of the effective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments as well as his right to a fair trial guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court found for petitioner. The Court of Appeals, without disturbing the District Court's factual findings, reversed, concluding that \"whenever the prosecution knowingly arranges or permits intrusion into the attorney-client relationship the right to counsel is sufficiently endangered to require reversal and a new trial,\" and that the concealment of petitioner's undercover status lulled respondent into a false sense of security, interfering with his trial preparations and denying him due process of law under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215. Held:\n1. Respondent was not deprived of his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment, which does not establish a per se rule forbidding an undercover agent to meet with a defendant's counsel. Black v. United States, 385 U.S. 26, 87 S.Ct. 190, 17 L.Ed.2d 26; O'Brien v. United States, 386 U.S. 345, 87 S.Ct. 1158, 18 L.Ed.2d 94; Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 408, 17 L.Ed.2d 374, distinguished. Pp. 550-559.\n(a) As long as the information possessed by petitioner about the two meetings remained uncommunicated, he posed no threat to respondent's Sixth Amendment rights. Pp. 554-557.\n(b) Petitioner went to the meetings, not to spy, but because he was asked by respondent and his counsel and because the State was interested in maintaining petitioner's status as an informant and not arousing respondent's suspicions. Adoption of the Court of Appeals' per se rule would for all practical purposes have required petitioner to unmask himself. Pp. 557-558.\n2. The Due Process Clause does not require that the prosecution must reveal before trial the names of undercover agents or other witnesses who will testify unfavorably to the defense. Pp. 559-561.\n(a) There is no constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case, and Brady, supra, did not create one. P. 559.\n(b) That petitioner not only concealed his identity but represented that he would not be a prosecution witness did not deny respondent a right to a fair trial. The misrepresentation was not deliberate, and there is no constitutional difference between the surprise testimony of an informer who is not suspected and therefore is not asked about testifying for the prosecution and the informer who, like petitioner, is asked by the defendant but denies that he will testify. P. 560.\n(c) Though the Court of Appeals also suggested that petitioner's continued duplicity denied respondent the opportunity to plea bargain, there is no constitutional right to plea bargain. Pp. 560-561.\n528 F.2d 483, reversed.\nJoseph Crouch Coleman, Grand Junction, Colo., for petitioners.\nAndrew L. Frey, Washington, D.C., for the United States, as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\nLaughlin McDonald, Atlanta, Ga., for respondent.\nMr. Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe issue here is whether in the circumstances present in this case the conduct of an undercover agent for a state law enforcement agency deprived respondent Bursey of his right to the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed him by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution or deprived him of due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n2\n* This case began when respondent Bursey filed suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against petitioners Weatherford and Strom, respectively an undercover agent for and the head of the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division, asserting that the defendants had deprived him of certain constitutional rights. The case was tried without a jury. The following facts are taken from the District Court's findings, which were not disturbed by the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n3\nDuring the early morning hours of March 20, 1970, Bursey and Weatherford, along with two others, vandalized the offices of the Richland County Selective Service in Columbia, S. C. Police were advised of the incident by Weatherford, who, in order to maintain his undercover status and his capability of working on other current matters in that capacity, was arrested and charged along with Bursey. Weatherford was immediately released on bond and, continuing the masquerade, retained an attorney, Frank Taylor, Sr. Bursey, who was later released on bond, retained his own counsel, C. Rauch Wise.\n\n\n4\nOn two occasions thereafter and prior to trial, Weatherford met with Bursey and Wise, and the approaching trial was discussed. With respect to these meetings, the District Court found as follows:\n\n\n5\n\"On neither of these occasions did the defendant Weatherford      seek information from the plaintiff or his attorney, and on      neither occasion did he initiate or ask for the meeting. He      was brought into the meetings by the plaintiff and      plaintiff's attorney in an effort to obtain information,      ideas or suggestions as to the plaintiff's defense. From the      beginning Weatherford advised plaintiff and plaintiff's      attorney that Weatherford would obtain a severance of his      case from that of the plaintiff. This severance was to be      upon the ground that Weatherford might be prejudiced in going      to trial with Bursey as a codefendant, because of Bursey's      reputation and participation in other activities which had      been covered by the news media. On no occasion did Bursey or      his attorney question the granting of a severance, nor did      they seem to concern themselves with whether the prosecutor      would consent to a severance, although such consent is quite      unusual where codefendants are charged with the same crime      and proof will be from the same witnesses based upon      identical facts. At those meetings between plaintiff,      plaintiff's attorney and defendant Weatherford the plaintiff      and his attorney raised the question of a possible informer      being used to prove the case, but they never asked      Weatherford if he were an informer and he never specifically      denied being an informer, since he was never asked or      accused.\" App. 248-249.\n\n\n6\nAt no time did Weatherford discuss with or pass on to his superiors or to the prosecuting attorney or any of the attorney's staff \"any details or information regarding the plaintiff's trial plans, strategy, or anything having to do with the criminal action pending against plaintiff.\" Id., at 249. Until the day of trial the prosecuting attorney did not plan to use Weatherford as a witness. Consequently, until then, Weatherford had not expected to be a witness and had anticipated continuing his undercover work. However, Weatherford had lost some of his effectiveness as an agent in the weeks preceding trial because he had been seen in the company of police officers, and he was called for the prosecution. He testified as to his undercover activities and gave an eyewitness account of the events of March 20, 1970. Bursey took the stand, was convicted, and then disappeared until apprehended some two years later, at which time he was incarcerated and forced to serve his 18-month sentence.\n\n\n7\nBursey then began this \u00a7 1983 action, alleging that Weatherford had communicated to his superiors and prosecuting officials the defense strategies and plans which he had learned at his meetings with Bursey and Wise, thereby depriving Bursey of the effective assistance of counsel to which he was entitled under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments as well as of his right to a fair trial guaranteed him by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court found for the defendants in all respects and entered judgment accordingly.\n\n\n8\nThe Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, 528 F.2d 483 (1975), concluding that \"on the facts as found by the district court Bursey's rights to effective assistance of counsel and a fair trial were violated.\" Id., at 486. The Court of Appeals held that \"whenever the prosecution knowingly arranges and permits intrusion into the attorney-client relationship the right to counsel is sufficiently endangered to require reversal and a new trial.\" Ibid. That the intrusion occurred in order to prevent revealing Weatherford's identity as an undercover agent was immaterial. The Court of Appeals thought that Weatherford was himself \"a member of the prosecution,\" id., at 487, and that therefore it was also immaterial that he had not informed other officials about what was said or done in the two meetings with Bursey and Wise.\n\n\n9\nIn addition, the Court of Appeals concluded that Bursey had been denied due process of law under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), by concealment of Weatherford's identity until the day of trial and by Weatherford's statement that he would not be a witness, all of which lulled Bursey into a false sense of security and interfered with his preparations for trial. The judgment of the District Court was reversed, but the remand for further proceedings would have allowed Weatherford and Strom to present a qualified immunity defense under Wood v. Strickland, 420 U.S. 308, 95 S.Ct. 992, 43 L.Ed.2d 214 (1975).\n\n\n10\nWe granted the petition for certiorari filed by Weatherford and Strom, who are represented by the State Attorney General. 426 U.S. 946, 96 S.Ct. 3165, 49 L.Ed.2d 1183 (1976). We reverse.\n\nII\n\n11\nThe exact contours of the Court of Appeals' per se right-to-counsel rule are difficult to discern; but as the Court of Appeals applied the rule in this case, it would appear that if an undercover agent meets with a criminal defendant who is awaiting trial and with his attorney and if the forthcoming trial is discussed without the agent's revealing his identity, a violation of the defendant's constitutional rights has occurred, whatever was the purpose of the agent in attending the meeting, whether or not he reported on the meeting to his superiors, and whether or not any specific prejudice to the defendant's preparation for or conduct of the trial is demonstrated or otherwise threatened. The Court of Appeals was of the view, 528 F.2d, at 486, that this Court \"establish(ed) such a per se rule\" in Black v. United States, 385 U.S. 26, 87 S.Ct. 190, 17 L.Ed.2d 26 (1966), and O'Brien v. United States, 386 U.S. 345, 87 S.Ct. 1158, 18 L.Ed.2d 94 (1967). The Court of Appeals also relied on Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 408, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966).\n\n\n12\nWe cannot agree that these cases, individually or together, either require or suggest the rule announced by the Court of Appeals and now urged by Bursey. Both Black and O'Brien involved surreptitious electronic surveillance by the Government, which was discovered after trial and conviction and which was plainly illegal under the Fourth Amendment.1 In each case, some, but not all, of the conversations overheard were between the criminal defendant and his counsel during trial preparation. The conviction in each case was set aside and a new trial ordered. The explanatory per curiam in Black, although referring to the overheard conversations with counsel, did not rule that whenever conversations with counsel are overheard the Sixth Amendment is violated and a new trial must be had. Indeed, neither the Sixth Amendment nor the right to counsel was even mentioned in the short opinion. The Solicitor General conceded that Black was entitled to a \"judicial determination\" of whether \"the monitoring of conversations between (Black) and his attorney had (any) effect upon his conviction or the fairness of his trial,\" although the Solicitor General contended that information derived from the overheard conversations was not used in any way by the prosecution. Memorandum for United States in Black v. United States, O.T. 1965, No. 1029, p. 4 (emphasis added). The Court focused on the particular form the \"judicial determination\" should take, concluding that on the particular facts of the case a new trial was the more appropriate means of affording Black \"an opportunity to protect himself from the use of evidence that might be otherwise inadmissible.\" 385 U.S., at 29, 87 S.Ct., at 192 (emphasis added). In O'Brien, the Court wrote nothing further, merely citing the Black per curiam. Once again the Solicitor General did not oppose further judicial proceedings to determine whether any information from the surveillance had been used at trial, notwithstanding his assertion that the contents of the overheard conversations were never communicated to the prosecuting attorneys. Brief for United States in O'Brien v. United States, O.T. 1966, No. 823, pp. 10-12.\n\n\n13\nIt is difficult to believe that the Court in Black and O'Brien was evolving a definitive construction of the Sixth Amendment without identifying the Amendment it was interpreting, especially in view of the well-established Fourth Amendment grounds for excluding the fruits of the illegal surveillance.2 If anything is to be inferred from these two cases with respect to the right to counsel, it is that when conversations with counsel have been overheard, the constitutionality of the conviction depends on whether the overheard conversations have produced, directly or indirectly, any of the evidence offered at trial. This is a far cry from the per se rule announced by the Court of Appeals below, for under that rule trial prejudice to the defendant is deemed irrelevant. Here, the courts below have already conducted the \"judicial determination,\" lacking in Black and O'Brien, of the effect of the overheard conversations on the defendant's conviction, and there is nothing in their findings or in the record to indicate any \"use of evidence that might be otherwise inadmissible.\"\n\n\n14\nNeither does the Court's decision in Hoffa v. United States, supra, support the proposition urged by respondent. There, an informant sat in on conversations that defendant Hoffa had with his lawyers and with others during the course of Hoffa's trial on a charge of violating the Taft-Hartley Act. The jury at that trial hung. Hoffa was then tried for tampering with that jury. The informer testified at the latter trial with respect to conversations he had overheard in Hoffa's hotel suite during the prior trial, not including, however, the conversations Hoffa had with counsel. The Court sustained Hoffa's jury-tampering conviction was sustained over his claim, among others, that his Sixth Amendment counsel right had been violated.\n\n\n15\nIn doing so, the Court did not hold that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel subsumes a right to be free from intrusion by informers into counsel-client consultations. Nor did it purport to describe the contours of any such right. The Court merely assumed, without deciding, that two cases in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dealing with the right to counsel, Caldwell v. United States, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 355, 205 F.2d 879 (1953), and Coplon v. United States, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 103, 191 F.2d 749 (1951), were correctly decided;3 assumed without deciding, that had Hoffa been convicted at his first trial, the conviction would have been set aside because the informer had overheard Hoffa and his lawyers conversing and had reported to the authorities the substance of at least some of those conversations; and then held that Hoffa's assumed Sixth Amendment rights had not been violated because the informer's testimony at the jury-tampering trial did not touch upon the overheard conversations with counsel but dealt only with conversations between Hoffa and third parties when his lawyers were not present. 385 U.S., at 307-308, 87 S.Ct., at 416. Neither Black, O'Brien, Hoffa, nor any other case in this Court to which we have been cited furnishes grounds for the interpretation and application of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments appearing in the Court of Appeals' opinion and judgment.\n\n\n16\nAt the same time, we need not agree with petitioners that whenever a defendant converses with his counsel in the presence of a third party thought to be a confederate and ally, the defendant assumes the risk and cannot complain if the third party turns out to be an informer for the government who has reported on the conversations to the prosecution and who testifies about them at the defendant's trial. Had Weatherford testified at Bursey's trial as to the conversation between Bursey and Wise; had any of the State's evidence originated in these conversations; had those overheard conversations been used in any other way to the substantial detriment of Bursey; or even had the prosecution learned from Weatherford, an undercover agent, the details of the Bursey-Wise conversations about trial preparations, Bursey would have a much stronger case.4\n\n\n17\nNone of these elements is present here, however. Weatherford's testimony for the prosecution about the events of March and April 1970 revealed nothing said or done at the meetings between Bursey and Wise that he attended.5 None of the Government's evidence was obtained as a consequence of Weatherford's participation in those meetings. Nevertheless, it might be argued that Weatherford, a dutiful agent, surely communicated to the prosecutors Bursey's defense plans and strategy and his attorney's efforts to prepare for trial, all of which was inherently detrimental to Bursey, unfairly advantaged the prosecution, and threatened to subvert the adversary system of criminal justice.\n\n\n18\nThe argument founders on the District Court's express finding that Weatherford communicated nothing at all to his superiors or to the prosecution about Bursey's trial plans or about the upcoming trial. App. 249, 252. The Court of Appeals did not disturb this finding, but sought to surmount it by declaring Weatherford himself to have been a member of the prosecuting team whose knowledge of Bursey's trial plans was alone enough to violate Bursey's constitutional right to counsel and to vitiate Bursey's conviction. 528 F.2d, at 487. Though imaginative, this reasoning is not a realistic assessment of the relationship of Weatherford to the prosecuting staff or of the potential for detriment to Bursey or benefit to the State that Weatherford's uncommunicated knowledge might pose. If the fact was, as found by the District Court, that Weatherford communicated nothing about the two meetings to anyone else, we are quite unconvinced that a constitutional claim under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments was made out.\n\n\n19\nThis is consistent with the Court's approach in the Hoffa case. There, the informant overheard several conversations between Hoffa and his attorneys, but the Court found it necessary to deal with the Sixth Amendment right-to-counsel claim only after noting that the informant had reported to the Government about at least some of the activities of Hoffa's defense counsel. 385 U.S., at 305-306, 87 S.Ct., at 415. As long as the information possessed by Weatherford remained uncommunicated, he posed no substantial threat to Bursey's Sixth Amendment rights. Nor do we believe that federal or state prosecutors will be so prone to lie or the difficulties of proof will be so great that we must always assume not only that an informant communicates what he learns from an encounter with the defendant and his counsel but also that what he communicates has the potential for detriment to the defendant or benefit to the prosecutor's case.\n\n\n20\nMoreover, this is not a situation where the State's purpose was to learn what it could about the defendant's defense plans and the informant was instructed to intrude on the lawyer-client relationship or where the informant has assumed for himself that task and acted accordingly. Weatherford, the District Court found, did not intrude at all; he was invited to the meeting, apparently not for his benefit but for the benefit of Bursey and his lawyer. App. 248. Weatherford went, not to spy, but because he was asked and because the State was interested in retaining his undercover services on other matters and it was therefore necessary to avoid raising the suspicion that he was in fact the informant whose existence Bursey and Wise already suspected.\n\n\n21\nThat the per se rule adopted by the Court of Appeals would operate prophylactically and effectively is very likely true; but it would require the informant to refuse to participate in attorney-client meetings, even though invited, and thus for all practical purposes to unmask himself. Our cases, however, have recognized the unfortunate necessity of undercover work and the value it often is to effective law enforcement. E. g., United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 432, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 1643, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973); Lewis v. United States, 385 U.S. 206, 208-209, 87 S.Ct. 424, 425-426 (1966). We have also recognized the desirability and legality of continued secrecy even after arrest. Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 59, 62, 77 S.Ct. 623, 627, 628, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957). We have no general oversight authority with respect to state police investigations. We may disapprove an investigatory practice only if it violates the Constitution; and judged in this light, the Court of Appeals' per se rule cuts much too broadly. If, for example, Weatherford at Bursey's invitation had attended a meeting between Bursey and Wise but Wise had become suspicious and the conversation was confined to the weather or other harmless subjects, the Court of Appeals' rule, literally read, would cloud Bursey's subsequent conviction, although there would have been no constitutional violation. The same would have been true if Wise had merely asked whether Weatherford was an informant, Weatherford had denied it, and the meeting then had ended; likewise if the entire conversation had consisted of Wise's questions and Weatherford's answers about Weatherford's own defense plans. Also, and more cogently for present purposes, unless Weatherford communicated the substance of the Bursey-Wise conversations and thereby created at least a realistic possibility of injury to Bursey or benefit to the State, there can be no Sixth Amendment violation. Yet under the Court of Appeals' rule, Bursey's conviction would have been set aside on appeal.\n\n\n22\nThere being no tainted evidence in this case, no communication of defense strategy to the prosecution, and no purposeful intrusion by Weatherford, there was no violation of the Sixth Amendment insofar as it is applicable to the States by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment. The proof in this case thus fell short of making out a \u00a7 1983 claim, and the judgment of the District Court should have been affirmed in this respect.\n\n\n23\nIt is also apparent that neither Weatherford's trial testimony nor the fact of his testifying added anything to the Sixth Amendment claim. Weatherford's testimony for the prosecution related only to events prior to the meetings with Wise and Bursey and referred to nothing that was said at those meetings. There is no indication that any of this testimony was prompted by or was the product of those meetings. Weatherford's testimony was surely very damaging, but the mere fact that he had met with Bursey and his lawyer prior to trial did not violate Bursey's right to counsel any more than the informant's meetings with Hoffa and Hoffa's lawyers rendered inadmissible the informer's testimony having no connection with those conversations.\n\nIII\n\n24\nBecause under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), the prosecution has the \"duty under the due process clause to insure that 'criminal trials are fair' by disclosing evidence favorable to the defendant upon request,\" the Court of Appeals also held that the State was constitutionally forbidden to \"conceal the identity of an informant from a defendant during his trial preparation,\" to permit the informant to \"deny up through the day before his appearance at trial that he will testify against the defendant,\" and then to have the informant \"testify with devastating effect.\" 528 F.2d, at 487. This conduct, the Court of Appeals thought, lulled the defendant into a false sense of security and denied him \"the opportunity (1) to consider whether plea bargaining might be the best course, (2) to do a background check on Weatherford for purposes of cross-examination, and (3) to attempt to counter the devastating impact of eyewitness identification.\" Ibid. The Court of Appeals apparently would have arrived at this conclusion whether or not Weatherford had ever met with Wise.\n\n\n25\nAgain we are in disagreement. Brady does not warrant the Court of Appeals' holding. It does not follow from the prohibition against concealing evidence favorable to the accused that the prosecution must reveal before trial the names of all witnesses who will testify unfavorably. There is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case, and Brady did not create one; as the Court wrote recently, \"the Due Process Clause has little to say regarding the amount of discovery which the parties must be afforded. . . .\" Wardius v. Oregon, 412 U.S. 470, 474, 93 S.Ct. 2208, 2212, 37 L.Ed.2d 82 (1973). Brady is not implicated here where the only claim is that the State should have revealed that a government informer would present the eyewitness testimony of a particular agent against the defendant at trial.\n\n\n26\nIn terms of the defendant's right to a fair trial, the situation is not changed materially by the additional element relied upon by the Court of Appeals, namely, that Weatherford not only concealed his identity but represented he would not be a witness for the prosecution, an assertion that proved to be inaccurate. There are several answers to the contention that the claim of misrepresentation is of crucial importance. The first is that there was no deliberate misrepresentation in this regard: The trial court found that until the day of trial Weatherford did not expect to be called as a witness; until then he did not know that he would testify. Second, as we understand the argument, it is that once the undercover agent has successfully caused an arrest, he risks causing an unfair trial if he denies his identity when accused or asked. We would hesitate so to construe the Due Process Clause. We are not at all convinced that there is a constitutional difference between the situation where the informant is sufficiently trusted that he is never suspected and never asked about the possibility of his testifying but nevertheless surprises the defendant by giving devastating testimony, and the situation we have here, where the defendant is suspicious enough to ask and the informant denies that he will testify but nevertheless does so. Moreover, if the informant must confess his identity when confronted by an arrested defendant, in many cases the agent in order to protect himself will simply disappear pending trial, before the confrontation occurs. In the last analysis however, the undercover agent who stays in place and continues his deception merely retains the capacity to surprise; and unless the surprise witness or unexpected evidence is, without more, a denial of constitutional rights, Bursey was not denied a fair trial.\n\n\n27\nThe Court of Appeals suggested that Weatherford's continued duplicity lost Bursey the opportunity to plea bargain. But there is no constitutional right to plea bargain; the prosecutor need not do so if he prefers to go to trial. It is a novel argument that constitutional rights are infringed by trying the defendant rather than accepting his plea of guilty. Moreover, Wise could have approached the prosecutor before trial and surely was under no misapprehension about Bursey's plight during trial. It was also suggested by the Court of Appeals that Bursey was deprived of the opportunity to investigate Weatherford in preparation for possible impeachment on cross-examination. But there was no objection at trial to Weatherford's testimony, no request for a continuance, and even now no indication of substantial prejudice from this occurrence. As for Bursey's claimed disability to counter Weatherford's \"devastating\" testimony, the disadvantage was no more than exists in any case where the State presents very damaging evidence that was not anticipated. Wise and Bursey must have realized that in going to trial the State was confident of conviction and that if any exculpatory evidence or possible defenses existed it would be extremely wise to have them available. Prudence would have counseled at least as much.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is\nReversed.6\n\n28\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting.\n\n\n29\nIt is easy to minimize the significance of the incursion into the lawyer-client relationship that the Court sanctions today. After all, as the Court observes, there is no evidence that Weatherford went to the meetings between Bursey and his lawyer with an intent to spy; that he reported to the prosecutor on those meetings; or that what he learned was used to develop evidence against Bursey. But while what occurred here may be \"the obnoxious thing in its mildest and least repulsive form . . . illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing in that way, namely, by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure.\" Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 635, 6 S.Ct. 524, 535, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886). I cannot join in providing even the narrowest of openings to the practice of spying upon attorney-client communications.\n\n\n30\nThere are actually two independent constitutional values that are jeopardized by governmental intrusions into private communications between defendants and their lawyers. First, the integrity of the adversary system and the fairness of trials is undermined when the prosecution surreptitiously acquires information concerning the defense strategy and evidence (or lack of it), the defendant, or the defense counsel. In Wardius v. Oregon, 412 U.S. 470, 93 S.Ct. 2208, 37 L.Ed.2d 82 (1973), this Court made clear that while \"the Due Process Clause has little to say regarding the amount of discovery which the parties must be afforded . . . it does speak to the balance of forces between the accused and his accuser.\" Id., at 474, 93 S.Ct., at 2212. Due process requires that discovery \"be a two-way street.\"\n\n\n31\n\"The State may not insist that trials be run as a 'search for      truth' so far as defense witnesses are concerned, while      maintaining 'poker game' secrecy for its own witnesses. It is      fundamentally unfair to require a defendant to divulge the      details of his own case while at the same time subjecting him      to the hazard of surprise concerning refutation of the very      pieces of evidence which he disclosed to the State.\" Id., at      475-476, 93 S.Ct., at 2212.\n\n\n32\nAt issue in Wardius was a statute compelling defendants to provide certain information about their case to the prosecution. But the same concerns are implicated when the State seeks such information, not by force of law, but by surreptitious invasions and deceit.\n\n\n33\nOf equal concern, governmental incursions into confidential lawyer-client communications threaten criminal defendants' right to the effective assistance of counsel. Only last Term we held that the right to counsel encompasses the right to confer with one's lawyer. Geders v. United States, 425 U.S. 80, 96 S.Ct. 1330, 47 L.Ed.2d 592 (1976). See also Reynolds v. Cochran, 365 U.S. 525, 531, 81 S.Ct. 723, 726, 5 L.Ed.2d 754 (1961); Hawk v. Olson, 326 U.S. 271, 278, 66 S.Ct. 116, 120, 90 L.Ed. 61 (1945); Avery v. Alabama, 308 U.S. 444, 446, 60 S.Ct. 321, 322, 84 L.Ed. 377 (1940); Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 57, 53 S.Ct. 55, 59, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932). But \"(a)s a practical matter, if the client knows that damaging information could more readily be obtained from the attorney following disclosure than from himself in the absence of disclosure, the client would be reluctant to confide in his lawyer and it would be difficult to obtain fully informed legal advice.\" Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 403, 96 S.Ct. 1569, 1577, 48 L.Ed.2d 39 (1976). See also United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 238-239, 95 S.Ct. 2160, 2170, 45 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975). For this reason, it has long been recognized that \"the essence of the Sixth Amendment right is . . . privacy of communication with counsel.\" United States v. Rosner, 485 F.2d 1213, 1224 (CA2 1973), cert. denied, 417 U.S. 950, 94 S.Ct. 3080, 41 L.Ed.2d 672 (1974). See, e. g., Caldwell v. United States, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 355, 205 F.2d 879 (1953); Coplon v. United States, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 103, 191 F.2d 749 (1951); Louie Yung v. Coleman, 5 F.Supp. 702, 703 (Idaho 1934); cf., e. g., In re Rider, 50 Cal.App. 797, 195 P. 965 (1920); Thomas v. Mills, 117 Ohio St. 114, 157 N.E. 488 (1927); State ex rel. Tucker v. Davis, 9 Okl.Cr. 94, 130 P. 962 (1913); Turner v. State, 91 Tex.Cr.R. 627, 241 S.W. 162 (1922); Annot., 5 A.L.R.3d 1360 (1966).\n\n\n34\nThe Court today apparently concludes that neither of these constitutional values is infringed when as here, the State does not act with a purpose to intercept information about the defense, and the information that is uncovered is neither transmitted to the prosecutor nor used by him to the defendant's detriment. I respectfully disagree. In my view, the \"balance of forces between the accused and his accuser\" is sharply skewed in favor of the accuser if the government's key witnesses are permitted to discover the defense strategy by intercepting attorney-client communications, even if the witnesses cannot divulge the information to the prosecution. With this information, the witnesses are in a position to formulate in advance answers to anticipated questions and even to shade their testimony to meet expected defenses.1 Furthermore, because of these dangers defendants may be deterred from exercising their right to communicate candidly with their lawyers if government witnesses can intrude upon the lawyer-client relationship with impunity so long as they do not discuss what they learn with the prosecutor.2 And insofar as the Sixth Amendment establishes an independent right to confidential communications with a lawyer, that right by definition is invaded when a government agent attends meetings of the defense team at which defense plans are reviewed.3\n\n\n35\nBut even if I were to agree that unintended and undisclosed interceptions by government witness-employees affect neither the fairness of trials nor the effectiveness of defense counsel, I still could not join in upholding the practice. For in my view, the precious constitutional rights at stake here, like other constitutional rights, need \"breathing space to survive,\" NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433, 83 S.Ct. 328, 338, 9 L.Ed.2d 405 (1963), and a prophylactic prohibition on all intrusions of this sort is therefore essential. A rule that offers defendants relief only when they can prove \"intent\" or \"disclosure\" is, I fear, little better than no rule at all. Establishing that a desire to intercept confidential communications was a factor in a State's decision to keep an agent under cover will seldom be possible, since the State always can argue plausibly that its sole purpose was to continue to enjoy the legitimate services of the undercover agent. Proving that an informer reported to the prosecution on defense strategy will be equally difficult, not only because such proof requires an informer or prosecutor to admit his own wrongdoing (and open the door to damages suits and attacks on convictions), but also because an informer's failure to make a report after overhearing a lawyer-client session oftentimes can be an effective means of communicating to the prosecutor that nothing surprising was uncovered.4 Given these problems of proof, the only way to assure that defendants will feel free to communicate candidly with their lawyers is to prohibit the government from intercepting such confidential communications, at least absent a compelling justification for doing so.5\n\n\n36\nLike the Court of Appeals, and unlike the majority today, I believe a per se rule of this sort is fully supported, if not compelled, by our decisions in Black v. United States, 385 U.S. 26, 87 S.Ct. 190, 17 L.Ed.2d 26 (1966), and O'Brien v. United States, 386 U.S. 345, 87 S.Ct. 1158, 18 L.Ed.2d 94 (1967). In both cases, the United States informed this Court that lawyer-client conversations had been intercepted by surveillance devices installed to investigate crimes unrelated to the crimes for which the defendants were convicted. Memorandum for United States in Black v. United States, O.T. 1965, No. 1029, p. 2; Brief for United States in O'Brien v. United States, O.T. 1966, No. 823, pp. 10-11. In Black the Government reported that information uncovered through the monitoring had been relayed to the prosecutors, but maintained that none of the evidence against the defendant had been derived from the surveillance, and that nothing was learned \"which had any effect upon the presentation of the government's case or the fairness of petitioner's trial.\" Memorandum for United States in Black v. United States, supra, at 4. In O'Brien the Government stated that the only intercepted lawyer-client conversation concerned the terms of the defendant's bail, and that neither this conversation nor any other conversation was disclosed to the prosecuting attorneys. Brief for United States in O'Brien v. United States, supra, at 11. In both cases, the United States urged a remand for a hearing to determine whether the intrusions had tainted the trials. Memorandum for United States in Black v. United States, supra, at 5; Brief for United States in O'Brien v. United States, supra, at 12. Yet in each case this Court rejected that course and instead remanded for a new trial. To say that these cases establish that \"when conversations with counsel have been overheard, the constitutionality of the conviction depends on whether the overheard conversations have produced, directly or indirectly, any of the evidence offered at trial,\" ante, at 552, twists the cases beyond recognition.6 That is precisely the principle that was urged by the Government and by the dissenters, Black v. United States, supra, at 30-31, 87 S.Ct. at 192 (Harlan, J., dissenting); O'Brien v. United States, supra, at 346-347, 87 S.Ct., at 1159 (Harlan, J., dissenting), but was rejected by the Court. By vacating the convictions without proof that \"the overheard conversations have produced . . . any of the evidence offered at trial,\" Black and O'Brien establish that \"any governmental activity of the kind here in question automatically vitiates . . . any conviction occurring during the span of such activity,\" Black v. United States, supra, at 31, 87 S.Ct., at 193 (Harlan, J., dissenting), and precludes the use of tainted evidence at any retrial.\n\n\n37\nRather than retreating from Black and O'Brien, I would reaffirm them and would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n\n1\n In Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505, 81 S.Ct. 679, 5 L.Ed.2d 734 (1961), the Court had held that eavesdropping accomplished through use of an electronic listening device similar to the \"tubular microphone\" used to overhear Black's and O'Brien's conversations constituted an unauthorized physical penetration of the petitioners' premises in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Solicitor General conceded that both Black and O'Brien should have been allowed to establish that the prosecution's case was tainted by the interception of conversations between Black and persons other than their attorneys as well as by conversations involving counsel, thus indicating his awareness of the illegality of the Government's eavesdropping under the Fourth Amendment.\n\n\n2\n See n. 1, supra.\n\n\n3\n Coplon held that interceptions by Government agents of telephone messages between the defendant and her lawyer before and during trial, if proved by the defendant, deprived her of her right to counsel and entitled her to a new trial. Caldwell held that the defendant's right to counsel was violated where a Government undercover agent went to work as an assistant for the defense and reported frequently to the prosecution on \"many matters connected with the impending trial.\" 92 U.S.App.D.C., at 356, 205 F.2d, at 880 (footnote omitted).\n\n\n4\n In Hoffa, the United States conceded, as it does here as amicus curiae, that the Sixth Amendment would be violated \"if the government places an informant in the defense camp during a criminal trial and receives from that informant privileged information pertaining to the defense of the criminal charges . . . because the Sixth Amendment's assistance-of-counsel guarantee can be meaningfully implemented only if a criminal defendant knows that his communications with his attorney are private and that his lawful preparations for trial are secure against intrusion by the government, his adversary in the criminal proceeding.\" Brief for United States in Hoffa v. United States, O.T. 1966, No. 32, p. 71, quoted in Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in the instant case, p. 24 n. 13.\nRespondent argues that Hoffa established the same right-to-counsel standard for government interception of attorney-client communications by an undercover agent as for interception by electronic surveillance. Even apart from the fact that the Court was merely assuming the existence of a right-to-counsel violation in that case, see supra, at 553, we find respondent's argument questionable. One threat to the effective assistance of counsel posed by government interception of attorney-client communications lies in the inhibition of free exchanges between defendant and counsel because of the fear of being overheard. However, a fear that some third party may turn out to be a government agent will inhibit attorney-client communication to a lesser degree than the fear that the government is monitoring those communications through electronic eavesdropping, because the former intrusion may be avoided by excluding third parties from defense meetings or refraining from divulging defense strategy when third parties are present at those meetings. Of course, in some circumstances the ability to exclude third parties from defense meetings may not eliminate the chilling effect on attorney-client exchanges, but neither Hoffa nor any other decision of this Court supports respondent's theory that the chill is the same whether induced by electronic surveillance or by undercover agents. Cf. Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 402-405, 96 S.Ct. 1569, 1576-1577, 48 L.Ed.2d 39 (1976) (attorney-client privilege protects only those disclosures which might not have been made absent the privilege, because the purpose of the privilege is to encourage confidential disclosures by a client to an attorney); 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2311, pp. 601-602 (McNaughton rev. ed. 1961) (attorney-client communications in the presence of a third party not the agent of either are generally not protected by the privilege).\n\n\n5\n See App. 225-240 (testimony of Weatherford at state trial). On cross-examination by Wise (Bursey's lawyer), Weatherford acknowledged that at the second meeting with Bursey and Wise, Weatherford told Wise, in response to the latter's questions, that he had not been asked to testify for the prosecution and that he did not anticipate being present at Bursey's trial. This testimony, elicited by defense counsel apparently for the purpose of discrediting Weatherford's testimony on direct examination, obviously does not constitute use by the prosecution of information obtained from Weatherford's attendance at defense meetings. Whatever the limitations on testimony by informants about statements made at defense meetings attended by them, the Sixth Amendment does not prevent the defense from introducing such statements to undercut the effectiveness of the informant's testimony for the prosecution.\n\n\n6\n Because we hold that Bursey's constitutional rights were not violated by Weatherford's actions, we reverse the holding of the Court of Appeals that Weatherford's superior, Strom, was also liable because of his involvement in Weatherford's undercover activities.\n\n\n1\n If, for example, Weatherford had learned that Bursey would use an entrapment defense against whoever admitted to being a government agent, Weatherford could have planned his testimony so as to minimize his own role and emphasize Bursey's predisposition. Bursey, on the other hand, would have had little time to reconstruct in his mind Weatherford's role in the decision to commit the crime once Weatherford testified that he was the state agent. Cf. United States v. Orman, 417 F.Supp. 1126, 1137 (Colo.1976).\n\n\n2\n The Court suggests, ante, at 555 n. 4, that defendants can protect themselves against intrusions by third parties by excluding them from meetings at which defense strategy is discussed. But when, as here, the third party is an indicted codefendant, exclusion is not practicable; codefendants need to be informed of each other's strategy if only to determine whether joinder is prejudicial, cf. Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 14. Indeed, because of the interdependence of codefendants, communications between a lawyer and his client generally remain privileged even when disclosed to a codefendant or his attorney. See The Attorney-Client Privilege in Multiple Party Situations, 8 Colum.J.Law & Soc.Problems 179 (1972).\n\n\n3\n Of course, the fact that Weatherford did not reveal what he learned may be relevant to the amount of damages Bursey can recover, as the Court of Appeals acknowledged. 528 F.2d 483, 487 (CA4 1975). No damages assessment has been made in this case, however, since the District Court found no liability.\n\n\n4\n In this case, for example, the prosecutor might have assumed that Weatherford had been privy to Bursey's defense plans, and that Weatherford's acquiescence when told of the prosecutor's decision to use him as a witness meant that the defense did not suspect Weatherford or have any damaging information about him.\n\n\n5\n There is no evidence in this record that Weatherford's life would have been jeopardized or any ongoing investigations compromised had Weatherford given up his cover on March 20, 1970, after the crime was committed, rather than on July 27, 1970, after trial began. To the contrary, the fact that Weatherford felt no need for police protection after trial, App. 107, suggests that there was no danger at any time. And the Chief of the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division conceded that Weatherford was not working on \"anything particular\" between the time of the crime and the time of the trial. Id., at 125. Indeed the Chief admitted that he \"wasn't concerned\" about losing Weatherford's cover because after breaking the case \"his identity is going to be known anyway.\" Id., at 124. Thus the only legitimate justification the State had for arresting and indicting Weatherford, and for retaining a lawyer and manufacturing a story for him was to postpone for several months the date at which a new agent would have to be assigned again.\n\n\n6\n The Court's alternative suggestion, ante, at 551-552, that Black and O'Brien were actually Fourth Amendment cases is equally unpersuasive. The briefs in Black, while noting the Fourth Amendment issue, Memorandum for United States 4; Supplemental Memorandum for Petitioner 6, focused on the Sixth Amendment violation, Memorandum for United States 3-4; Supplemental Memorandum for Petitioner 7-20. The opinion does not mention either the Fourth or Sixth Amendment, but the narration of the facts makes clear that the Court's primary concern was the interception of lawyer-client conversations. 385 U.S., at 27-28, 87 S.Ct., at 190-191. Moreover, during the same Term that Black and O'Brien were decided, the Court, in another electronic surveillance case, remanded for a taint hearing rather than for a new trial because, \"(u)nlike the situations in Black . . . and O'Brien . . . there was apparently no direct intrusion here into attorney-client discussions.\" Hoffa v. United States, 387 U.S. 231, 233, 87 S.Ct. 1583, 1584, 18 L.Ed.2d 738 (1967). See also Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 576, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2984, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974) (White, J.) (citing Black and O'Brien as Sixth Amendment cases); Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 307, 87 S.Ct. 408, 416 (1966) (citing Black as Sixth Amendment case).\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"370 U.S. 650\n82 S.Ct. 1399\n8 L.Ed.2d 750\nR. Milo GILBERT, Petitioner,v.UNITED STATES.\nNo. 478.\nArgued April 10, 1962.\nDecided June 25, 1962.\n\nFred Okrand and Albert A. Dorn, Los Angeles, Cal., for petitioner.\nKirby W. Patterson, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nMr. Justice HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner, an accountant whose business included acting for others in federal income tax matters, was charged in a thirty-five-count indictment with violations of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(2), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7206(2), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 495, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 495, in that he had allegedly falsified his clients' returns (\u00a7 7206(2)), forged their endorsements on government tax-refund checks (\u00a7 495), and, by endorsing such checks, had made false statements as to a matter within the jurisdiction of a government agency (\u00a7 1001). The jury convicted on thirty-one counts and acquitted on four others. On appeal, 9 Cir., 291 F.2d 586, 597, the judgment of conviction was set aside as to twenty-nine counts, and a new trial ordered, because the Court of Appeals found that evidence used by the Government in support of these counts had been illegally seized. The judgment as to the remaining two counts (Nos. 21 and 22), charging the petitioner with having forged the endorsements of Daniel H. Bartfield and Charline R. Bartfield on two government refund checks (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 495, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 495), was affirmed.1\n\n\n2\nIt was stipulated at the trial that petitioner had endorsed in his own handwriting the two checks, made out to:\n\n\n3\n'Daniel H & Charlene R Bartfield\n\n\n4\nc\/o R Milo Gilbert\n\n519 Taft Building\n\n5\nHollywood 28 Calif'\n\n\n6\nin the following manner:\n\n\n7\n'Daniel H. Bartfield\n\nCharline R. Bartfield\nR. Milo Gilbert, Trustee'2\n\n8\nPetitioner claimed that a written power of attorney, allegedly signed by both Bartfields in his office, authorized him to endorse tax-refund checks, and that 'Trustee' after his name served to designate the particular bank account where he deposited and held all client-refunds until December of each year, against the possibility of there being a refund adjustment and until his contingent fee was settled. The Bartfields acknowledged that the signatures on the power of attorney were theirs, but disclaimed recollection of signing the instrument, and denied that they ever authorized petitioner orally or in writing to receive or endorse checks.3\n\n\n9\nOn these premises the Court of Appeals, concluding that the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find that petitioner had endorsed the checks without authority (a conclusion which for present purposes we accept), held that one who endorses a government check by signing the name of the payee and then his own, as agent, when in fact he has no such authority, is guilty of forgery under \u00a7 495. We granted certiorari to consider the correctness of that view of the statute. 368 U.S. 816, 82 S.Ct. 93, 7 L.Ed.2d 23. While not mentioned in the petition for certiorari, though discussed in the briefs on the merits, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, after the Court of Appeals' decision in the present case, held that 'forgery' under \u00a7 495 does not embrace a purported, but misrepresented, agency endorsement (hereafter called simply an 'agency endorsement'). Selvidge v. United States, 290 F.2d 894. For reasons given in this opinion we agree with the Tenth Circuit.\n\nI.\n\n10\nAt the outset we are met with the Government's suggestion that the statutory construction question need not be faced in this case. Before the Court of Appeals, as in the petition for certiorari, it was assumed by all that the two checks (which after the trial and before the case reached this Court had for some reason become mislaid) had been endorsed 'by R. Milo Gilbert, Trustee.' (Emphasis added.) That was a mistaken assumption for, as the checks themselves show (supra, 370 U.S., p. 651, 82 S.Ct., p. 1400), there was no 'by' before 'R. Milo Gilbert, Trustee.'\n\n\n11\nArguing that the jury might have found that the word 'Trustee' after Gilbert's signature did not purport to indicate an agency endorsement, but was merely intended as a designation for routing the checks for deposit in one of Gilbert's 'client' bank accounts, the Government suggests that a plain case of forgery is made out, and the agency-endorsement question is not in truth presented by the record.\n\n\n12\nWe cannot so easily dispose of the case. For accepting the premise that the jury could have found that petitioner did not purport to act in a representative capacity when he endorsed the checks, it was surely also permissible for the jury to find that petitioner had purported to make an agency endorsement in both instances, and we are thus left to speculate on which theory its verdict in fact rested. Indeed the record before us seems to indicate that this aspect of the case was tried, at least primarily, on an agency-endorsement theory. The trial judge's instructions to the jury on this phase of the case were at best opaque. Having refused to instruct the jury that an agency endorsement was not forgery under \u00a7 495,4 he at no point undertook to explain the difference between an agency and a nonagency endorsement.5 Nor can we perceive any force in the Government's further suggestion that the jury's verdict on these two counts might have rested simply on the theory that in describing himself as 'Trustee' the petitioner had made a fictious endorsement, in that he had never occupied that status. Since the charge was that petitioner had forged the names of the Bartfields, not of their agent, this is but another way of describing the agency-endorsement version of the transaction.\n\n\n13\nIn this posture of things the Government's proposal that we bypass decision of the question that brought the case here must be rejected. If an agency endorsement does not constitute forgery under \u00a7 495, the petitioner is at least entitled to a new trial under proper jury instructions.\n\nII.\n\n14\nThe original predecessor of \u00a7 495 was enacted in 1823, 3 Stat. 771, and in respects here pertinent has throughout the intervening years been in substantially the same form as \u00a7 495. There is no significant legislative history illuminating \u00a7 495 or any of its predecessors. In deciding whether 'forges' under \u00a7 495 embraces agency endorsements, it is therefore important to inquire, as the Government recognizes, into the common-law meaning of forgery at the time the 1823 statute was enacted. For in the absence of anything to the contrary it is fair to assume that Congress used that word in the statute in its common-law sense.\n\n\n15\nIn 1847 it was decided in the English case of Regina v. White, 2 Car. & K. 404, 175 Eng.Rep. 167 (Nisi Prius, Book 6), that 'indorsing a bill of exchange under a false assumption of authority to indorse it per procuration, is not forgery, there being no false making.'6 2 Car. & K., at 412, 175 Eng.Rep., at 170 (Nisi Prius, Book 6). This to be sure was some twenty-four years after the 1823 predecessor of \u00a7 495 came on the books. The Government says that this English decision should be regarded as but an ill-advised and temporary departure from the earlier common law which was 'soon recognized' and remedied by the passage of the Forgery Act of 1861, 24 & 25 Vict., c. 98, \u00a7 24, defining forgery to include unauthorized signings 'per procuration,' with intent to defraud.7 The Government draws from earlier English authority, 2 East, Pleas of the Crown, 850\u2014859 (1803); 1 Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, c. 70; Coke, Third Institute (1797 ed.) 169; 4 Blackstone, Commentaries, 247, the conclusion that agency endorsements did constitute forgery under the common law as it existed when the 1823 American statute was passed.\n\n\n16\nThis view cannot readily be accepted. The fifteen judges who participated in Regina v. White unanimously decided that case as they did only after considering the earlier English authorities. Such of those authorities as are now relied on by the Government are by no means as clear as the Government would have them. Thus Lord East's comments, supra, at p. 852, were: 'Forgery at common law denotes a false making (which includes every alternation of or addition to a true instrument), a making malo animo, of any written instrument for the purpose of fraud and deceit. * * * (The ancient and modern authorities) all consider the offence as consisting in the false and fraudulent making or altering of such and such instruments.' (Emphasis in original). Coke,8 Hawkins,9 and Blackstone,10 who are also cited by the Government, are no more persuasive towards the Government's view. The more inclusive definition of forgery contained in the English statutes, supra, 370 U.S., p. 655, 82 S.Ct., p. 1402 and note 7, proves not that Regina v. White was mistaken in its view of the common law but only that a broader definition was deemed desirable by Parliament. And finally, the Regina v. White view of forgery at common law was early accepted in a federal case as representing the English common law. In re Extradition of Tully, C.C., 20 F. 812. The same view of forgery has since been followed in most of the state and federal courts in this country. See, e.g., People v. Bendit, 111 Cal. 274, 276\u2014280, 43 P. 901, 902, 31 L.R.A. 831; Pasadena Investment Co. v. Peerless Casualty Co., 132 Cal.App.2d 328, 331, 282 P.2d 124, 125, 52 A.L.R.2d 203; State v. Lamb, 198 N.C. 423, 425\u2014426, 152 S.E. 154, 155\u2014156; Dexter Horton Nat. Bank of Seattle v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 149 Wash. 343, 346\u2014351, 270 P. 799, 800\u2014802; Greathouse v. United States, 4 Cir., 170 F.2d 512, 514; Marteney v. United States, 10 Cir., 216 F.2d 760, 763 764.\n\n\n17\nThe foregoing considerations combine to lead us to the conclusion that 'forge' in \u00a7 495 should not be taken to include an agency endorsment. So the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has held in Selvidge v. United States, supra, the only case in the lower federal courts squarely dealing with the point,11 and we perceive no sound reason for rejecting its conclusion. We find no more persuasive than did the Court of Appeals in Selvidge (290 F.2d, at 896 and note 2) the scattered federal cases relied on by the Government in support of the opposite view.12 Nor are we impressed with the argument that 'forge' in \u00a7 495 should be given a broader scope than its common-law meaning because contained in a statute aimed at protecting the Government against fraud.13 Other federal statutes are ample enough to protect the Government against fraud and false statements. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001\u20141026, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1001\u20141026. Still further, it is significant that cases construing 'forge' under other federal statutes have generally drawn a distinction between false or fraudulent statements and spurious or fictitious makings. See, e.g., Greathouse v. United States, supra (construing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2314); Wright v. United States, 9 Cir., 172 F.2d 310, 311\u2014312 (construing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2314); Marteney v. United States, supra (construing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2314; United States v. Carabasi, 3 Cir., 292 F.2d 362, 364 (construing 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1622(h), 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1622(h)). Where the 'falsity lies in the representation of facts, not in the genuineness of execution,' it is not forgery. Marteney v. United States, supra, 216 F.2d at 763\u2014764. Of course, Congress could broaden the concept of 'federal' forgery by statutory definition. We hold only that it has not yet done so.\n\n\n18\nWe conclude that petitioner's conviction cannot be sustained upon this record. However, since we are not prepared at this stage to say that the Government might not be entitled to succeed on these two counts of the indictment upon the theory that petitioner never signed the Bartfields' names in a representative capacity, we think the way should be left open for a retrial of them under proper jury instructions, in conjunction with the other counts already remanded by the Court of Appeals, within a reasonable time. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n\n\n19\nJudgment of the Court of Appeals vacated and case remanded to the District Court.\n\n\n20\nMr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice CLARK, and Mr. Justice STEWART dissent, believing that one who endorses a check in the name of the payee without authority to do so is guilty of forgery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 495, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 495, whether or not the forger falsely purports to have signed the payee's name as an authorized agent.\n\n\n21\nMr. Justice FRANKFURTER and Mr. Justice WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n\n1\n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 495, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 495, provides: 'Whoever falsely makes, alters, forges, or counterfeits any deed, power of attorney, order, certificate, receipt, contract, or other writing, for the purpose of obtaining or receiving, or of enabling any other person, either directly or indirectly, to obtain or receive from the United States or any officers or agents thereof, any sum of money. * * *\n'Shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.'\nCounts 21 and 22, which are identical in form, charge:\n'On or about June 2, 1958, * * * the defendant R. Milo Gilbert knowingly and wilfully forged on United States Treasury Check * * * the endorsement and signature of the payees, Daniel H. and Chalrene R. Bartfield, for the purpose of obtaining and receiving said amount from the United States, its officers and agents.'\n\n\n2\n As payee of the two checks, Mrs. Bartfield's first name (Charline) was incorrectly spelled 'Chalrene' on one and 'Charlene' on the other, the former misspelling being carried over into the indictments. (Note 1, supra.) On one of the checks, petitioner's first name, as part of the payee inscription, was incorrectly spelled 'Mile.'\n\n\n3\n No claim is made in this case that there was anything wrong with the Bartfields' income tax returns, to which the two refund checks related.\n\n\n4\n Petitioner's requested instructions pertinent to these two counts, both rejected, were:\n1. 'One who executes an instrument purporting on its face to be executed by him as agent of a principal named therein, when in fact he has no authority for such principal to execute said instrument, is not guilty of forgery. People v. Bendit, 111 C(al.) 274 (43 P. 901, 31 L.R.A. 831) (1896); International Finance Corporation v. People's Bank of Keyser (D.C.), 27 F.2d 523, at 527. 4 I ALR 231 n.'\n2. 'A check endorsed as follows\u2014name of payee by other as trustee, does not constitute a forged instrument under U.S.C. Title 18, Section 495 (18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 495).'\n\n\n5\n Other than a dictionary definition of the word 'trustee,' the only instructions given the jury by the trial judge on this phase of the case were these:\n'Where a tax accountant represents a taxpayer in the preparation of tax returns, there is no presumption of authority and the rights of the tax accountant must be governed by the terms of his employment, as applies to any other ordinary agency.\n'Also, a power of attorney to prosecute a claim against the Government giving authority to receive a check in payment gives the agent no power to indorse and collect the check. But such authority may be given either orally or by writing.'\nNo instructions specifically addressed to the elements of the offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001, were given, and the Government does not here seek to support the conviction on the two forgery counts on the basis of that section.\n\n\n6\n The trial judge, in summation, had instructed the jury 'that if they were of opinion that the prisoner, at the time when he signed this indorsement, had wilfully misrepresented that he came from Mr. Tomlinson (the defendant's former employer) with intent to defraud him or the bankers, and had no authority from Mr. Tomlinson, they ought to find him guilty.' 2 Car. & K., at 406, 175 Eng.Rep., at 168 (Nisi Prius, Book 6).\n\n\n7\n The statute presently in effect in England, the Forgery Act of 1913, 3 & 4 Geo. 5, c. 27, \u00a7 1(2), provides that a document is forged 'if the whole or any material part thereof purports to be made by or on behalf or on account of a person who did not make it nor authorise its making * * *.'\n\n\n8\n 'Lord Coke (Third Institute 169) indeed seems to confine it (forgery) in strictness to an act done in the name of another, but this was long ago agreed * * * to be too narrow a definition.' 2 East, Pleas of the Crown, 852 (1803). Hawkins interpreted Coke to say that even the altenation of a deed, by adding a 0 to 500 to make it 5000, 'may more properly be called a false than a forged Writing, because it is not forged in the Name of another, nor his Seal nor Hand counterfeited.' 1 Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, c. 70, \u00a7 2, at 183 (1762).\n\n\n9\n 'Forgery by the Common Law seemeth to be an Offence in falsly and fraudulently making or altering any Matter of Record, or any other authentick Matter of a publick Nature * * *.' 1 Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, c. 70, \u00a7 1, p. 182 (1762). 'Also the Notion of Forgery doth not seem so much to consist in the counterfeiting a Man's Hand and Seal, which may often be done innocently, but in the endeavouring to give an Appearance of Truth to a mere Deceit and Falsity, and * * * to impose that upon the World as the solemn Act of another * * *.' Id., \u00a7 2, at 183.\n\n\n10\n 'Forgery, or the crimen falsi, * * * may with us be defined (at common law) to be, 'the fraudulent making or alteration of a writing to the prejudice of another man's right' * * *.' 4 Blackstone, Commentaries (Christian ed. 1809), 247\u2014248.\n\n\n11\n We do not read the early case of United States v. Osgood, 27 Fed.Cas.No.15,971a, p. 362, decided under the 1823 statute, as pointing to a different conclusion.\n\n\n12\n Ex parte Hibbs, D.C., 26 F. 421; Yeager v. United States, 59 App.D.C 11, 32 F.2d 402; United States v. Tommasello, D.C., 64 F.Supp. 467; Quick Service Box Co. v. St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co., 7 Cir., 95 F.2d 15.\n\n\n13\n The fact that the original 1823 statute had a proviso disclaiming any purpose to preempt state criminal jurisdiction in respect of matters covered by the Federal Act does not of course, as the Government suggests, indicate that 'forgery' had a wider meaning in federal than under state law. Cf. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3231, where a similar general proviso relating to all statutes in Title 18 is now found.\n\n\n","label":0}

Ginnane, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner is detained by respondent under a deportation order, the validity of which is challenged by a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The District Court granted the petition and discharged petitioner. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. Del Guercio v. Delgadillo, 9 Cir., 159 F.2d 130. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted because of the seeming conflict between the decision below and Di Pasquale v. Karnuth, 2 Cir., 158 F.2d 878, from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n\n2\nPetitioner is a Mexican citizen who made legal entry into this country in 1923 and resided here continuously until 1942. In June of that year, when this nation was engaged in hostilities with Germany and Japan, he shipped out of Los Angeles on an intercoastal voyage to New York City as a member of the crew of an American merchant ship. The ship was torpedoed after passing through the Panama Canal on its way to New York City. Petitioner was rescued and taken to Havana, Cuba, where he was taken care of by the American Consul for about one week. On July 19, 1942, he was returned to the United States through Miami, Florida, and thereafter continued to serve as a seaman in the merchant fleet of this nation. In March 1944 he was convicted in California of seconddegree robbery and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of one year to life. While he was confined in the California prison, proceedings for deportation were commenced against him under \u00a7 19(a) of the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, 39 Stat. 874, as amended 54 Stat. 671, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 155(a), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 155(a).\n\n\n3\nThat section provides in part: '* * * any alien who is hereafter sentenced to imprisonment for a term of one year or more because of conviction in this country of a crime involving moral turpitude, committed within five years after the entry of the alien to the United States * * * shall, upon the warrant of the Attorney General, be taken into custody and deported. * * *'\n\n\n4\nThose requirements for deportation are satisfied if petitioner's passage from Havana, Cuba, to Miami, Florida, on July 19, 1942, was 'the entry of the alien to the United States' within the meaning of the Act.\n\n\n5\nIn United States ex rel. Claussen v. Day, 279 U.S. 398, 49 S.Ct. 354, 73 L.Ed. 758; United States ex rel. Stapf v. Corsi, 287 U.S. 129, 53 S.Ct. 40, 77 L.Ed. 215, and United States ex rel. Volpe v. Smith, 289 U.S. 422, 53 S.Ct. 665, 77 L.Ed. 1298, there is language which taken from its context suggests that every return of an alien from a foreign country to the United States constitutes an 'entry' within the meaning of the Act. Thus in the Smith case it was stated, 289 U.S. at page 425, 53 S.Ct. at page 667, 77 L.Ed. 1298, that 'any coming of an alien from a foreign country into the United States whether such coming be the first or any subsequent one' is such an 'entry.' But those were cases where the alien plainly expected or planned to enter a foreign port or place. Here he was catapulted into the ocean, rescued, and taken to Cuba. He had no part in selecting the foreign port as his destination. His itinerary was forced on him by wholly fortuitous circumstances. If, nonetheless, his return to this country was an 'entry' into the United States within the meaning of the Act, the law has been given a capricious application as Di Pasquale v. Karnuth, supra, suggests.\n\n\n6\nIn that case an alien traveled between Buffalo and Detroit on a railroad which, unknown to him passed through Canada. He was asleep during the time he was in transit through Canada and was quite unaware that he had left or returned to this country. The court refused to hold that the alien had made an 'entry,' for to do so would impute to Congress a purpose to subject aliens 'to the sport of chance.' 158 F.2d at page 879. In this case petitioner, of course, chose to return to this country, knowing he was in a foreign place. But the exigencies of war, not his voluntary act, put him on foreign soil.1 It would indeed be harsh to read the statute so as to add the peril of deportation to such perils of the sea. We might as well hold that if he had been kidnapped and taken to Cuba, he made a statutory 'entry' on his voluntary return.

We will not attribute to Congress a purpose to make his right to remain here dependent on circumstances so fortuitous and capricious as those upon which the Immigration Service has here seized.

The Immigration and Naturalization Service has approved this practice with respect to both daily and seasonal commuters, and has classified such aliens as immigrants 'lawfully admitted for permanent residence' who are 'returning from a temporary visit abroad,' a category of 'special immigrant' defined by the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(27)(B). Those with that classification have freedom from usual documentation and numerical requirements and from the labor certification requirements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(14). Certain farmworkers and a collective-bargaining agent for farmworkers brought this suit for declaratory and injunctive relief against the practice of thus classifying such alien commuters. The District Court dismissed the action. The Court of Appeals upheld the classification as to daily commuters but rejected it as to seasonal commuters. Held: Alien commuters are immigrants who are 'lawfully admitted for permanent residence,' and are 'returning from a temporary visit abroad' when they enter the United States, and this 'special immigrant' classification is applicable to both daily and seasonal commuters. This has long been the administrative construction of the statute in the context of alien commuters, a factor which must be accorded great weight when, as here, congress has considered the subject and has not seen fit to alter the administrative practice. Pp. 69\u201480. 156 U.S.App.D.C. 304, 481 F.2d 479, affirmed in part and reversed in part.\nMark L. Evans, Washington, D.C., for William Saxbe and others.\nBruce J. Terris, Washington, D.C., for Robert Bustos, Cristobal Cardona and others.\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nSome aliens who have their homes in Canada or Mexico commute daily to places of employment in this country and others do so on a seasonal basis, a practice permitted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The question is whether the practice on the facts of these cases conforms with the Immigration and Nationality Act. It turns on the meaning of \u00a7 101(a)(27)(B), 66 Stat. 169, as amended, 79 Stat. 916, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(27)(B), which defines as one variety of 'special immigrant' an immigrant 'lawfully admitted for permanent residence, who is 'returning from a temporary visit abroad.'\n\n\n2\nThose who qualify under \u00a7 1101(a)(27)(B) may be permitted entry without the usual documentation requirements. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1881(b). The regulations1 implement \u00a7 1181(b) by allowing such an immigrant to use an alien registration receipt card, normally called a 'green card,' in lieu of an immigrant visa and without regard to numerical limitations2 if he is 'returning to an unrelinquished lawful permanent residence in the United States after a temporary absence abroad not exceeding 1 year.'\n\n\n3\nThe Act presumes that an alien is an immigrant 'until he establishes . . . that he is entitled to a nonimmigrant status';3 and it defines 'immigrant' as every alien who cannot bring himself into an enumerated class of nonimmigrants.4 One class of nonimmigrants5 is 'an alien having a residence in a foreign country which he has no intention of abandoning . . . (ii) who is coming temporarily to the United States to perform temporary services or labor, if unemployed persons capable of performing such service or labor cannot be found in this country.'\n\n\n4\nAn alien does not qualify as a nonimmigrant under this class of nonimmigrants if he seeks to perform temporary labor at a time when unemployed persons capable of performing that labor can be found in this country.6 If he cannot qualify as a nonimmigrant some other way, such an alien is subject to the Act's numerical limitations, unless he is included in the classes of 'immediate relatives' of a United States citizen or 'special immigrants.'7 On the other hand, as already noted, one variety of 'special immigrant' is an alien 'lawfully admitted for permanent residence, who is returning from a temporary visit abroad.'8 One who so qualifies is excluded from the labor certification provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(14).9 The term 'lawfully admitted for permanent residence' is defined as 'the status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States as an immigrant . . . such status not having changed.'10 An alien achieves that status in the first instance by complying with any applicable numerical limitations and with the Act's other requirements for admission, details not important here. After his initial admission on that basis, he is free to leave this country temporarily and to re-enter without regard to numerical limitations. The Act authorizes the Attorney General to re-admit such an alien without a visa or other formal documentation. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1181(b). He has exercised that authority, allowing such an immigrant to return with what was called in the briefs and oral argument as the 'green card.'\n\n\n5\nThis suit was brought by the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee11 for declaratory and injunctive relief against the practice of giving alien commuters the documentation and labor certification benefits of classification as immigrants 'lawfully admitted for permanent residence' who are 'returning from a temporary visit abroad.'12 The District Court dismissed the action without opinion. The Court of Appeals held that the admission of daily commuters was proper but that the admission of seasonal commuters was not, 156 U.S.App.D.C. 304, 481 F.2d 479 (1973). We granted the petition and cross-petition in light of a conflict between the decision below and that of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Gooch v. Clark, 433 F.2d 74 (1970).\n\n\n6\nOur conclusions are that commuters are immigrants, that they are 'lawfully admitted for permanent residence,' and that they are 'returning from a temporary visit abroad' when they enter the United States. Moreover, the wording and legislative history of the statute and the long administrative construction indicate that the same treatment is appropriate for both daily and seasonal commuters. Commuters are thus different from those groups of aliens who can be admitted only on certification by the Secretary of Labor that unemployed persons cannot be found in this country and that the employment of the aliens 'will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of the workers in the United States.' 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(14). We thus agree with the conclusion of the Ninth Circuit in Gooch. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment now before us as respects daily commuters and reverse it as respects seasonal commuters.\n\n\n7\nA main reliance of plaintiffs is on the provision of the Act13 which in the much-discussed subsection (15)(H)(ii) provides that one category of alien nonimmigrant is 'an alien having a residence in a foreign country which he has no intention of abandoning . . . (ii) who is coming temporarily to the United States to perform temporary services or labor, if unemployed persons capable of performing such service or labor cannot be found in this country.' Under the argument tendered, these alien commuters partially meet the definition of nonimmigrants in subsection (15)(H)(ii) in that they have a foreign residence which they do not intend to abandon and come here temporarily to perform temporary service, but fail to satisfy subsection (15)(H)(ii) completely in that they do not show that unemployed people capable of performing the services cannot be found in this Nation. That should invoke the presumption in the Act, already noted, that an alien is an immigrant until or unless he proves he is a nonimmigrant.14\n\n\n8\nWe agree, moreover, with the Ninth Circuit that this provision 'was intended to confer nonimmigrant status on certain aliens who were needed in the American labor force but who, unlike commuters, would be unable to achieve admittance under immigrant status.' 433 F.2d, at 78. The administrative construction of this subsection (15)(H)(ii) by the Immigration Service15 has been that it does not cover an alien, like the commuter, who has a 'permanent residence' here and who comes to perform a job of a permanent character, even though the period of his service is limited. To repeat, the Act provides that '(e)very alien shall be presumed to be an immigrant until he establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer . . . and the immigration officers . . . that he is entitled to a nonimmigrant status under section 1101(a)(15).'16 Before an alien can be classified as a nonimmigrant under subsection (15)(H)(ii) his prospective employer must submit a petition on his behalf under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1184(c); and after the INS approves the petition, the alien must apply for nonimmigrant status and demonstrate that he in fact qualifies for that status.17\n\n\n9\nWe conclude that commuters are not nonimmigrants under subsection (15)(H) (ii). None of the other categories of nonimmigrants are applicable, and thus under \u00a7 1184(b) the commuters are immigrants.\n\n\n10\nThe fact that an alien commuter who has not shown he must be classified as a nonimmigrant must be classified as an immigrant is not the end of our problem. The question remains whether he may properly be treated as one who is in the group defined as 'special immigrants' under subsection (27)(B),18 that is, whether commuters are 'lawfully admitted for permanent residence' when they have no actual residence in this country.\n\n\n11\nSection 1101(a)(20) defines 'lawfully admitted for permanent residence' as 'the status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws, such status not having changed' (italics added). The definition makes the phrase descriptive of a status or privilege which need not be reduced to a permanent residence to be satisfied, so long as that status has not changed.\n\n\n12\nOne argument of the plaintiffs is that the status has changed because residence in this country was never claimed. But we read the Act as did the Ninth Circuit in the Gooch case to mean that the change in status which Congress had in mind was a change from an immigrant lawfully admitted for permanent residence to the status of a nonimmigrant pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257. 433 F.2d, at 79.\n\n\n13\nThe status referred to in \u00a7 1101(a)(20) is acquired when an alien satisfies (1) any numerical limitations on the entry of immigrants,19 (2) requirements as to qualitative matters such as health, morals, and economic status,20 and (3) the need for an immigrant visa.21 The applicant must also state whether he plans to remain in the United States permanently.22 But the Act does not declare or suggest that the status will be denied him, if he does not intend to reside permanently here. As we read the Act, the 'status' acquired carries several important privileges: He may remain in the United States indefinitely; he is free to work in this country; he may return to this country after a temporary absence abroad; and he has the privilege of establishing a permanent residence in the United States.\n\n\n14\nThus we conclude that commuters are immigrants 'lawfully admitted for permanent residence.' As did both the majority and dissent in Gooch, we also find that commuters can be viewed as 'returning from a temporary visit abroad.' 433 F.2d, at 79\u201481, 82 n. 1. The Court below so agreed as respects daily commuters, disagreeing only as to seasonal commuters. Neither the court below nor the Court of Appeals in Gooch took the position now taken in dissent here.\n\n\n15\nOur conclusion reflects the administrative practice, dating back at least to 1927 when the Bureau of Immigration was a part of the Department of Labor.23 In 1940 the Bureau was transferred to the Department of Justice24 where it remains today. On April 1, 1927, it issued General Order No. 86.25 Under the order, commuters were required to gain admission as immigrants before they could have border crossing privileges. The order provides that '(a)liens who have complied with the requirements of this General Order governing permanent admission will be considered as having entered for permanent residence.' 'Thus,' said the Court of Appeals in the instant cases, 'the daily commuter was born,' 156 U.S.App.D.C., at 304, 481 F.2d, at 485.\n\n\n16\nThis longstanding administrative construction is entitled to great weight, particularly when, as here, congress has revisited the Act and left the practice untouched. Such a history of administrative construction and congressional acquiescence may add a gloss or gualification to what is on its face unqualified statutory language. Massachusetts Trustees v. United States, 377 U.S. 235, 84 S.Ct. 1236, 12 L.Ed.2d 268 (1964); United States v. Midwest Oil Co., 236 U.S. 459, 35 S.Ct. 309, 59 L.Ed. 673 (1915). As the defendants below acknowledge, the meaning of the phrase 'lawfully admitted for permanent residence' in \u00a7 1101(a)(27)(B) may not be identical to the meaning of the same language in other sections of the Act where the same history of administrative construction is not present.\n\n\n17\nWe see no difference in the treatment of daily commuters and seasonal commuters. The status of the seasonal commuter is the same as the status of the daily commuter because the identical statutory words cover each. The Court of Appeals, however, rested essentially on a different legislative history of seasonal commuters than had obtained in cases of daily commuters.\n\n\n18\nPrior to 1917 there were essentially no limitations on the practice of commuting from Mexico or Canada to the United States. Legislation was passed in 1917, 1921, and 1924.26 But under those statutes commuters remained able freely to cross the border subject only to qualitative restrictions in the 1917 Act.\n\n\n19\nAs already noted, the administrative approach changed in 1927 when the Bureau of Immigration issued its General Order No. 86. While the 1952 Act, 66 Stat. 163, made no mention of commuters and while the 1965 amendments of the 1952 Act, 79 Stat. 911, were likewise silent as respects commuters, the Court of Appeals assumed that the longstanding practice of allowing daily commuters was not repealed sub silentio; and we agree. The Court of Appeals, however, took quite a different view of the seasonal commuter problem because of its different history.\n\n\n20\nThe seasonal commuter problem dates back at least to 1943 when this Government and Mexico agreed to the seasonal importation of Mexican agricultural workers. 56 Stat. 1759. Congress legislated on the problem in 1951,27 requiring farmers in this Nation to make reasonable efforts to attract domestic workers prior to certification by the Secretary of Labor of the need for foreign labor. That was known as the bracero program and the Court of Appeals called the seasonal commuter merely a new name for the former bracero. That is quite inaccurate. The braceros were at the start nonimmigrants; the seasonal commuters were immigrants. Some braceros, indeed quite a few, H.R.Rep.No. 722, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 7 (1963) acquired permanent residence status. The seasonal commuter, like the daily commuter, has always been in that category.\n\n\n21\nIn 1964 the bracero type of seasonal program lapsed; and the next year Congress amended the Immigration and Nationality Act by making stricter the certification by the Secretary of Labor of the need for foreign labor and requiring findings on the lack of any adverse effect of the employment of aliens on the wages and working conditions of workers in this country.\n\n\n22\nBut that provision, which we have quoted,28 does not apply to aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence returning from a temporary visit abroad and to certain close relatives. An alien who first sought admission after the effective date of the 1965 amendment would need a certificate of the Secretary of Labor; but if he already was an alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence and returning from a temporary visit abroad the 1965 amendments would not affect him. The purpose of Congress was to limit new admissions of alien laborers, not to prejudice the status of aliens, who, whether daily or seasonal commuters, had acquired permanent residence here and were returning to existing jobs.29\n\n\n23\nWe have mentioned General Order No. 86 issued on April 1, 1927, which treated the commuters as immigrants (not nonimmigrants), who on obtaining their admission cards would be 'considered as having entered for permanent residence.'30 Cf. Karnuth v. United States ex rel. Albro, 279 U.S. 231, 244, 49 S.Ct. 274, 73 L.Ed. 677 (1929).31 The thrust of General Order No. 86 was to lift aliens who were natives of Canada and Mexico from the quota provisions for nonimmigrants. Thus, they entered from that time down to date, with nonquota immigration documents. That regulation was carried forward in various regulations before 1952.32 The practice was reviewed and sustained in various published administrative decisions.33 Some suggested that the 1952 Act eliminated the alien commuter. The Board of Immigration Appeals, however, reaffirmed the validity of the practice. Matter of H. _ _ O _ _, 5 I. & N. Dec. 716 (1954). Thereafter repeated administrative decision34 affirmed the adherence to the alien-commuter concept. We do not labor the administrative construction phase of these cases further, because when the 1952 Act was reported, the Senate Judiciary Committee tendered a voluminous report of nearly 1,000 pages touching on the alien commuters, describing the practice in some detail, and including the sections which we have discussed in this opinion. The commuters from Canada and Mexico were treated as lawfully admitted immigrants. No doubt as to the desirability of the practice was expressed. It is clear that S.Rep.No. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. (1950) (the Omnibus Study Report), reveals a congressional acceptance of the system.\n\n\n24\nThe changes relevant to commuters in the 1965 amendments were, as stated in Gooch, minor and technical and contain no suggestion of a change in the commuter problem, 433 F.2d, at 80 81. H.R.Rep. No. 745, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965); S.Rep. No. 748, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965).\n\n\n25\nSince 1965 there have been numerous reports by committees of the Congress on the alien commuter problem which indicate that Congress is very knowledgeable about the problem and has not reached a consensus that the administrative policy reaching back at least to General Order No. 86 is wrong. We know from the Western Hemisphere Report35 that the dimensions of the problem are considerable. Daily commuters from Mexico number more than 42,000 of whom 25,000 are engaged in occupations other than agriculture. The total of Canadian commuters exceeds 10,000. Seasonal commuters number at least 8,300 according to the Service's estimate. The United States Commission on Civil Rights estimates that if Mexican commuters were cut off, they would lose $50 million annually.36 The State Department estimates there are 250,000 family members dependent on income earned by commuters37 and that commuters account for 25% to 30% of the income earned by the labor force in some Mexican border communities.38 Termination of the alien commuter practice might well have a great impact on American border communities because the Mexicans who have the status of permanent residents could settle here, increasing the problems of housing and education in the border towns this side of the Rio Grande. Former Secretary of State Rogers submitted to the District Court an affidavit stating that any 'sudden judicial termination of the commuter system, displacing the present immigrant commuters, would have a serious deleterious effect upon our relations with both Mexico and Canada.'\n\n\n26\nOur conclusion is twofold. First, the provisions of the Act which sanction daily commuters are the ones that also support seasonal commuters. We would have to read to same language in two opposed ways to sanction the daily commuter program and strike down the seasonal commuter program. There is no difference in administrative treatment of the two classes of commuters.\n\n\n27\nSecond, if alien commuters are to be abolished or if seasonal commuters are to be treated differently from daily commuters, the Congress must do it. The changes suggested implicate so many policies and raise so many problems of a political, economic, and social nature that it is fit that the Judiciary recuse itself. At times judges must legislate 'interstitially' to resolve ambiguities in laws. But the problem of taking all or some alien commuters engaging in farm work out of the Act is not 'interstitial' or, as Mr. Justice Holmes once put it, 'molecular.'39 It is a massive or 'molar' action for which the Judiciary is ill-equipped.\n\n\n28\nWe affirm the Court of Appeals insofar as it held daily commuters are lawfully admitted and reverse it insofar as seasonal commuters are concerned.\n\n\n29\nSo ordered.\n\n\n30\nJudgment of Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\n\n31\nMr. Justice WHITE, joined by Mr. Justice BRENNAN, Mr. Justice MARSHALL, and Mr. Justice BLACKMUN, dissenting.\n\n\n32\nThe Court, in reaching an interpretation of the immigration statutes which permits a finding that daily and seasonal commuters from Mexico and Canada are 'special immigrants' not subject to documentation and numerical restrictions upon entry to this country, contravenes one of the cardinal principles of statutory construction: 'administrative practice does not avail to overcome a statute so plain in its commands as to leave nothing for construction.' Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, 288 U.S. 294, 315, 53 S.Ct. 350, 358, 77 L.Ed.796 (1933) (Cardozo, J.). Administrative construction over a long period of time is an available tool for judicial interpretation of a statute only when the statutory terms are doubtful or ambiguous. United States v. Southern Ute Indians, 402 U.S. 159, 173 n. 8, 91 S.Ct. 1336, 1343, 28 L.Ed.2d 695 (1971); Estate of Sanford v. Commissioner, 308 U.S. 39, 52, 60 S.Ct. 51, 59, 84 L.Ed. 20 (1939); Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, supra. In light of the characteristics of the aliens whose status is in question and the ordinary meaning of the very specific terms Congress used in these immigration statutes, this principle applies with force here.\n\n\n33\n* Daily and reasonal commuters both reside in fact in either Mexico or Canada and cross the border into this country either daily or seasonally to work.1 The daily commuter's defining characteristic is his limited presence in this country; he comes across the border to work each day and returns to his actual dwelling place in Mexico or Canada when his work is done. The seasonal commuter, in contrast, remains in this country continuously during the seasons in which he works here, but then absents himself completely for the remaining portions of the year. For the Court to reach its result, it must undertake the unlikely project of demonstrating that these aliens are in legal effect permanent residents of the United States under the immigration laws.\n\n\n34\nTo qualify as a 'special immigrant' given dispensations from normal documentation requirements and numerical limitations, a commuter must be 'an immigrant, lawfully admitted for permanent residence, who is returning from a temporary visit abroad.' 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(27)(B). The included phrase 'lawfully admitted for permanent residence' means in turn 'the status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws, such status not having changed.' \u00a7 1101(a)(20). The immigration laws define 'permanent residence' as 'the place of general abode,' a person's 'principal, actual dwelling place in fact, without regard to intent,' \u00a7 1101(a)(33), with the relationship of the person to the place of residence being 'of continuing or lasting nature, as distinguished from temporary . . ..' \u00a7 1101(a)(31). Under the Immigration and Naturalization Service's own regulations, in order to be exempt from the normal documentation requirements upon entry, an alien must be returning to his 'unrelinquished lawful permanent residence' from a 'temporary absence abroad.' 8 CFR \u00a7 211.1(b)(1). On its face, the present practice of the Service is flatly contrary to its own regulation.\n\n\n35\nConfronted with the obvious difficulty that this statutory language defining permanent resident status and the regulations will not accommodate the daily and seasonal commuters,2 the majority, without the aid of legislative history, contends that these plain words should be given special, technical meanings:\n\n\n36\n'Section 1101(a)(20) defines 'lawfully admitted for permanent      residence' as 'the status of having been lawfully accorded      the privilege of residing permanently in the United States as      an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws, such      status not having changed' (italics added). The definition      makes the phrase descriptive of a status or privilege which      need not be reduced to a permanent residence to be satisfied, so long as that status has not changed.'      Ante, at 71 (italics supplied by the Court).\n\n\n37\nThe use of italics will not alter the ordinary meaning of the statutory terminology, however, and the Court gives no basis for believing that Congress intended something other than the ordinary meaning of the words it used. No one could reasonably suggest that Congress was seeking to accommodate the commuters when it enacted these definitions and to provide special status to those who do not reside and do not intend to reside in this country. Clearly it was dealing with those aliens who seek permanent-resident status in this country and who fulfill that intention.\n\n\n38\nSince the language of the statute simply will not bend to allow the proposition which the Government and the Court adopt that in defining 'lawfully admitted for permanent residence' Congress meant to include persons who have never intended to reside permanently in this country, who do not currently reside in this country, and who never will become actual permanent residents3\u2014the ultimate rationale for the decision must be that the plain meaning of the statute has been changed by a longstanding administrative practice accepted by Congress as the appropriate construction.4\n\nII\n\n39\nAdministrative construction of a statute which conflicts with the express meaning of the statutory terms can be viewed as authoritative only if it appears that Congress has in fact accepted that construction, and the burden of proof necessarily is on the proponent of the administrative view. Since '(c) ongressional inaction frequently betokens unawareness, preoccupation, or paralysis,' Zuber v. Allen, 396 U.S. 168, 185 186, n. 21, 90 S.Ct. 314, 324, 24 L.Ed.2d 345 (1969), congressional silence standing alone cannot constitute congressional acceptance of a continuing administrative practice. The Court, however, elevates such silence to acquiescence by stressing proof of the practice and the absence of any indication that Congress has 'repealed' it. Ante, at 75.\n\n\n40\nThe administrative practice of treating daily commuters as immigrant aliens began in 1927 with the Department of Labor's General Order No. 86.5 Since Mexicans and Canadians were not subject to numerical limitations on entry into this country, this classification of the commuters had no practical effect upon them; informal documentation requirements were followed.6 It was not until 1952 that Congress enacted a provision which could have limited the entry of commuters. Under \u00a7 212(a)(14) of the 1952 Act, 66 Stat. 183, Congress provided that an immigrant could not enter if the Secretary of Labor certified that there were sufficient domestic workers available in his field of work or that his entry would have an adverse impact on the wages or working conditions of domestic workers. In 1965, Congress tightened this restriction by providing that aliens were inadmissible unless the Secretary of Labor certified that there were insufficient domestic workers available in the field and that the employment of aliens would not adversely affect wages and conditions of American workers. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(14).7 In another 1965 amendment, Congress imposed the first quota on immigration from the Western Hemisphere, effective in 1968.8\n\n\n41\nThere can be no reasonable presumption, therefore, that prior to 1952 Congress concerned itself with the propriety of the administrative classification of daily commuters under the immigration statutes.9 Only with the passage of the 1952 legislation and subsequent amendments was there evidence of some possible concern on the part of Congress with the number of Mexican and Canadian aliens entering this country to work. Thus if Congress both expressed concern at the influx of alien workers but approved the commuter practice, then the Court's conclusion of congressional acquiescence in the administrative construction would have some persuasive force. Since that construction conflicts with the meaning of the statute on its face, however, something more than silence is required to establish acquiescence. Cf. Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6, 24\u201425, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 1541 1542, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969). The only evidence of congressional acceptance cited by the Court is a brief description of the prior practice with respect to commuters contained in an extremely extensive report of an investigation of this Nation's immigration system published by the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1950.10 The fact that '(n)o doubt as to the desirability of the practice was expressed,' ante, at 78, will not overcome the fact that the terms of the statute passed two years later are incompatible with that practice, and neither the Court nor the Government can point to any express congressional acceptance of that practice in spite of the incompatibility.11 The Court does say that since 1965 there have been numerous committee reports indicating congressional knowledge of the commuter problem and that Congress 'has not reached a consensus that the administrative policy . . . is wrong.' Ibid. But the Court has clearly, and erroneously, placed the burden upon Congress to show that it has not accepted the practice rather than on the administrative agency to establish that Congress has acquiesced.\n\n\n42\nVery recently, in noting an exception to the principle of giving great weight to an administrative construction of a statute, we said that 'an agency may not bootstrap itself into an area in which it has no jurisdiction by repeatedly violating its statutory mandate.' FMC v. Seatrain Lines, Inc., 411 U.S. 726, 745, 93 S.Ct. 1773, 1785, 36 L.Ed.2d 620 (1973). But the Court has allowed an agency to do so in this case.12\n\nIII\n\n43\nThe majority acknowledges the many political, economic, and social implications of the issues in this case and the need for the Court to legislate only when interstitial ambiguities in a statute require resolution, but it then rests its rejection of these unambiguous provisions of the immigration laws upon legislative considerations: the economic consequences to the alien commuters and to their communities of finding that the administrative practice is not consistent with the statute, the possible impact upon American border communities if those commuters who are legally capable of doing so choose to take up actual residence in this country, and the need to avoid negative effects upon this country's relations with Mexico and Canada. Ante, at 78\u201479. But these interests, as well as the opposing interests of domestic labor, form part of the congressional calculus, and this Court is hardly equipped or authorized to predict by its decision the direction in which that balance of interests will ultimately tip. Because I believe that the Court has strayed from the neutral judicial function of applying traditional principles of statutory construction, I must respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n 8 CFR \u00a7 211.1(b)(1).\n\n\n2\n 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1181(a) and 1151\u20141153.\n\n\n3\n \u00a7 1184(b).\n\n\n4\n \u00a7 1101(a)(15).\n\n\n5\n \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(H).

See Hearings on H.R. 9112, H.R. 15092, H.R. 17370 before Subcommittee No. 1 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 205\u2014207.\n\n\n36\n Stranger in One's Land 12 (Clearinghouse Publication No. 19, 1970).\n\n\n37\n Statement of Assistant Secretary of State Oliver to the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, Sept. 25, 1967, p. 6.\n\n\n38\n Id., at 4.\n\n\n39\n 'I recognize without hesitation that judges do and must legislate, but they can do so only interstitially; they are confined from molar to molecular motions.' Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U.S. 205, 221 (1917) 37 S.Ct. 524, 531, 61 L.Ed. 1086 (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n1\n Counsel for the federal parties (hereinafter the Government) indicated at oral argument that commuters actually form a spectrum rather than two hard-and-fast categorles. Some commuters stay in this country for whole seasons and then switch later to daily commuting. Some daily commuters come across the border less regularly than every workday, and sometimes seek only temporary employment and switch employers. Tr. of Oral Arg., 18, 52, 54.\n\n\n2\n Strain between the statute and the administrative practice is also evident in the need for the Government to fit the daily commuter's trip each day from his home in Mexico or Canada to his workplace in this country as a return to this country 'from a temporary visit abroad.' 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(27)(B) (emphasis added). As indicated in the text, the regulations refer to a return to 'an unrelinquished lawful permanent residence' in this country from 'a temporary absence abroad . . ..' 8 CFR \u00a7 211.1(b).\n\n\n3\n In an effort to make the facts fit the statute, the Court of Appeals found that the commuter's place of work could be considered his permanent residence. 156 U.S.App.D.C. 304, 311, 481 F.2d 479, 486 (1973). Others have noted the 'logical inconsistency' and the lack of a precise fit between the practice and the law but have justified the discordance by citing 'practical needs and considerations of foreign policy.' 1 C. Gordon & H. Rosenfield, Immigration Law and Procedure \u00a7 2.19, p. 2 105 (1973 Cum.Supp.). The practice has been viewed as an 'amiable fiction' and the product of 'administrative ingenuity.' Id., \u00a7 2.8b, p. 2\u201443 (1974). The Board of Immigration Appeals has similarly acknowledged that the commuter practice 'manifestly does not fit into any precise category found in the immigration statutes' and that '(t)he status is an artificial one, predicated upon good international relations maintained and cherished between friendly neighbors.' Matter of M_ _ D_ _ S_ _, 8 I. & N.Dec. 209, 213 (1958).\n\n\n4\n The effect of the Court's decision is not only to stretch the meaning of the statute so as to include commuters within the permanent resident status, but also to throw into question the meaning of 'permanent resident' throughout the immigration laws with obvious anomalous consequences. See Gooch v. Clark, 433 F.2d 74, 83\u201485 (CA9 1970) (Wright, J., dissenting). For example, the 'spouses, unmarried sons or unmarried daughters of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence' are included in the second preference group for immigration visas. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a)(2). Thus a commuter's immediate kin are perhaps eligible for a preference although the commuter may himself have been entitled to no preference. The Government suggests that the commuter's status for other purposes is not before the Court and need not be decided. Brief for Federal Parties 28. But the Court should be reluctant to accept an invitation to make an ad hoc decision with respect to one aspect of a statutory definition where it is clear that the definition is a central one which Congress has provided with the intent of having it applied generally.\n\n\n5\n See the relevant text of General Order No. 86, ante, at 74 75 n. 25.\n\n\n6\n The Court's opinion suggests that General Order No. 86 removed commuters from quota restrictions applicable to nonimmigrants. Ante, at 77. But Mexican and Canadian commuters had not been subject to any quotas. The Immigration Act of 1924 imposed no quotas on nonimmigrants, and Mexicans and Canadians were not subject to immigrant quotas. 43 Stat. 153. The General Order was designed primarily to prevent quota aliens from entering this country through Canada and Mexico as nonimmigrants. Letter from Secretary of Labor, dated Nov. 26, 1928, in App. A of H.R.Rep.No. 2401, 70th Cong., 2d Sess., 5\u201410 (1929). Informal documentation was maintained despite the classification of the commuters as immigrants because the immigration authorities did not view Congress as intending to interfere with the practice of border crossings by commuters. Report of Select Commission on Western Hemisphere Immigration 101\u2014102 (1968).\n\n\n7\n The Secretary of Labor has not issued a certification allowing the entry of aliens seeking employment as farm laborers. 29 CFR. \u00a7\u00a7 60.2(a)(2), 60.7 (Schedule B).\n\n\n8\n \u00a7 21(e), 79 Stat. 921.\n\n\n9\n The Government refers to the inclusion in an early draft of a House bill, H.R. 5138, which ultimately became the Alien Registration Act of 1940, of a provision which would have prohibited any alien from entering this country from Mexico or Canada for the purposes of working or seeking employment. Hearing on H.R. 5138 before Subcommittee No. 3, of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., ser. 3, p. 3 (1939). The deletion of that provision prior to the reporting of the bill does not signal congressional approval of the administrative classification of commuters, but rather, as with the absence of quotas restricting the entry of Mexicans and Canadians, an unwillingness to restrict such entry which persisted at least until 1952.\n\n\n10\n S.Rep.No. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 535\u2014536, 616 (1950).\n\n\n11\n The Government concedes that the seasonal commuter practice grew after the bracero program had lapsed. Tr. of Oral Arg., 53; Brief for Federal Parties 75. See also Gordon, The Amiable Fiction\u2014Alien Commuters Under Our Immigration Laws, in Employment of 'Green Card' Aliens During Labor Disputes, Hearings on H.R. 12667 before the Special Subcommittee on Labor of the House Committee on Education and Labor, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 181, 183 (1969). Therefore, there is even less reason for believing that Congress acquiesced in the administrative classification of seasonal commuters.\n\n\n12\n The majority cites Massachusetts Trustees v. United States, 377 U.S. 235, 84 S.Ct. 1236, 12 L.Ed.2d 268 (1964), and United States v. Midwest Oil co., 236 U.S. 459, 35 S.Ct. 309, 59 L.Ed. 673 (1915), in support of its rationale of statutory construction. Ante, at 74. A comparison of the statutes and facts of those cases\nwith the situation here, however, graphically reveals the extent of the majority's departure from accepted canons of construction.\nIn Massachusetts Trustees the Court was faced with the problem of harmonizing apparently inconsistent sections of the same statute governing an agency's authority. The literal language of the statute was found insufficiently precise to dispose of the question, Under these circumstances, the Court looked to the agency's practice, which could be given 'some weight'; but the successive extensions by Congress of the agency's authority in the face of the agency's prior practice was not, even then, to be controlling. 377 U.S., at 241\u2014245, 84 S.Ct., at 1241\u20141244.\nIn Midwest Oil Co. the Presidential power to withdraw public lands from private acquisition which Congress by legislation had made free and open to occupation and purchase was found in the hundreds of such withdrawal orders, beginning in the early years of the Government, which had not been repudiated by Congress. In addition, the Executive Order in question was issued seven years after the Secretary of the Interior, in response to a resolution of the Senate calling for information as to the authority for such withdrawals, sent to the Senate a report which cited the longstanding practice and the Executive's claim of authority. Congress took no action to repudiate that claim. Legislation soon after the order in question authorized such withdrawals by the President prospectively, expressed no intention on the part of Congress to repudiate past withdrawals, and left the question of the validity of past withdrawals to the courts. 236 U.S., at 469 471, 480\u2014483, 35 S.Ct., at 311\u2014312, 315\u2014317. Nothing in this case remotely resembles the historical record upon which congressional acquiescence was premised in Midwest Oil Co.\n\n\n","label":1}

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, with one judge dissenting, reversed the Hobbs Act conviction,1 holding that, \" 'although an activity may be within the literal language of the Hobbs Act, it must constitute 'racketeering\" to be within the perimeters of the Act.' \"  548 F.2d 1355, 1357, quoting United States v. Yokley, 542 F.2d 300, 304 (CA6 1976).  We granted certiorari, 434 U.S. 816, 98 S.Ct. 53, 54 L.Ed.2d 71 (1977),2 and we now reverse.\n\n\n5\n* Nothing on the face of the statute suggests a congressional intent to limit its coverage to persons who have engaged in \"racketeering.\"  To the contrary, the statutory language sweeps within it all persons who have \"in any way or degree  . . . affect[ed] commerce  . . .  by robbery or extortion.\"  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (1976 ed.).  These words do not lend themselves to restrictive interpretation;  as we have recognized, they \"manifest . . .  a purpose to use all the constitutional power Congress has to punish interference with interstate commerce by extortion, robbery or physical violence,\"  Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212, 215, 80 S.Ct. 270, 272, 4 L.Ed. 252 (1960).  The statute, moreover, carefully defines its key terms, such as \"robbery,\" \"extortion,\" and \"commerce.\"3  Hence the absence of any reference to \"racketeering\"\u2014much less any definition of the word\u2014is strong evidence that Congress did not intend to make \"racketeering\" an element of a Hobbs Act violation.\n\n\n6\nRespondent nevertheless argues that we should read a racketeering requirement into the statute.  To do so, however, might create serious constitutional problems, in view of the absence of any definition of racketeering in the statute.  Neither respondent nor either of the two Courts of Appeals that have read this requirement into the statute has even attempted to provide a definition.  Without such a definition, the statute might well violate \"the first essential of due process of law\":  It would forbid \"the doing of an act in terms so vague that [persons] of common intelligence [would] necessarily [have to] guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\"   Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 127, 70 L.Ed. 322 (1926);  see, e. g., Hynes v. Mayor of Oradell, 425 U.S. 610, 620, 96 S.Ct. 1755, 1760, 48 L.Ed.2d 243 (1976).  But we need not concern ourselves with these potential constitutional difficulties because a construction that avoids them is virtually compelled by the language and structure of the statute.\n\nII\nA.\n\n7\nNothing in the legislative history supports the interpretation of the statute adopted by the Court of Appeals.4 The predecessor to the Hobbs Act, the Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934, ch. 569, 48 Stat. 979, was enacted, as its name implies, at a time when Congress was very concerned about racketeering activities.  Despite these concer s, however, the Act, which was written in broad language similar to the language of the Hobbs Act, nowhere mentioned racketeering.5  This absence of the term is not surprising, since the principal congressional committee working on the Act, known as the Copeland Committee, found that the term and the associated word \"racket\" had \"for some time been used loosely to designate every conceivable sort of practice or activity which was either questionable, unmoral, fraudulent, or even disliked, whether criminal or not.\" S.Rep.No.1189, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1937).6\n\n\n8\nThe Copeland Committee proceeded to develop its own \"working definition\" of racketeering, but it did not incorporate this definition into the Act.  Ibid.  Critical to the definition was the existence of \"an organized conspiracy to commit the crimes of extortion or coercion.\"  Id., at 3.  Yet the Act itself did not require a conspiracy to engage in unlawful conduct, and the Senate Judiciary Committee Report expressly stated that a violation of the Act would be established \" 'whether the restraints [of commerce] are in form of conspiracies or not,' \" S.Rep.No.532, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1934), quoting Justice Department memorandum;  see H.R.Rep.No.1833, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1934).  Moreover, the Act included a separate prohibition on conspiracies, \u00a7 2(d), 48 Stat. 980;  see n. 5, supra, that would have been superfluous if proof of racketeering\u2014as defined by the Copeland Committee to require conspiracy\u2014were an integral element of the substantive offenses.7  There is nothing in the legislative history to dispell the conclusion compelled by these  bservations. Congress simply did not intend to make racketeering a separate, unstated element of an Anti-Racketeering Act violation.\n\nB\n\n9\nGiven the absence of this intent in the Hobbs Act's predecessor, any requirement that racketeering be proved must be derived from the Hobbs Act itself or its legislative history. While the Hobbs Act was enacted to correct a perceived deficiency in the Anti-Racketeering Act, that deficiency had nothing to do with the element of racketeering.  See United States v. Enmons, 410 U.S. 396, 401-404, 93 S.Ct. 1007, 1010-1011, 35 L.Ed.2d 379 (1973).  Rather, it involved the latter Act's requirement that the proscribed \"force, violence or coercion\" lead to exaction of \"valuable consideration\" and its exclusion of wage payments from the definition of consideration.  See n. 5, supra.  In construing the wage-payments exclusion, this Court had held that the Act did not cover the actions of union truckdrivers who exacted money by threats or violence from out-of-town drivers in return for undesired and often unutilized services.  United States v. Teamsters, 315 U.S. 521, 62 S.Ct. 642, 86 L.Ed. 1004 (1942). Shortly thereafter, several bills were introduced in Congress to alter this result.  United States v. Enmons, supra, 410 U.S., at 402, and n. 8, 93 S.Ct. at 1010.\n\n\n10\nThe bill that eventually became the Hobbs Act deleted the exception on which the Court had relied in Teamsters and substituted specific prohibitions against robbery and extortion for the Anti-Racketeering Act's language relating to the use of force or threats of force.  The primary focus in the Hobbs Act debates was on whether the bill was designed as an attack on organized labor.  Opponents of the bill argued that it would be used to prosecute strikers and interfere with labor unions.  See, e. g., 91 Cong.Rec. 11848 (1945) (remarks of Rep. Lane);  ibid. (remarks of Rep. Powell);  id., at 11902 (remarks of Rep. Celler). The proponents of the bill steadfastly maintained that the purpose of the bill was to prohibit robbery and extortion perpetrated by anyone.  See, e. g., id., at 11900 (remarks of Rep. Hancock); id., at 11904 (remarks of Rep. Gwynne);  id., at 11912 (remarks of Rep. Hobbs);  id., at 11914 (remarks of Rep. Russell). Although there were many references in the debates to \"racketeers\" and \"racketeering,\" see, e. g., id., at 11906 (remarks of Rep. Robinson);  id., at 11908 (remarks of Rep. Vursell);  id., at 11910 (remarks of Rep. Andersen), none of the comments supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend to make punishable all conduct falling within the reach of the statutory language.  To the contrary, the debates are fully consistent with the statement in the Report of the House Committee on the Judiciary that the purpose of the bill was \"to prevent anyone from obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce, or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce by robbery or extortion as defined in the bill.\"  H.R.Rep.No.238, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 9 (1945) (emphasis added);  see also S.Rep.No.1516, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1946).8\n\n\n11\nIndeed, many Congressmen praised the bill because it set out with more precision the conduct that was being made criminal.  As Representative Hobbs noted, the words robbery and extortion \"have been construed a thousand times by the courts.  Everybody knows what they mean.\"  91 Cong.Rec. 11912 (1945).  See also id., at 11906 (remarks of Rep. Robsion);  id., at 11910 (remarks of Rep. Springer);  id., at 11914 (remarks of Rep. Russell).  In the wake of the Court's decision in Teamsters, moreover, a paramount congressional concern was to be clear about what conduct was prohibited:\n\n\n12\n\"We are explicit.  That language is too general, and we      thought it better to make this bill explicit, and leave      nothing to the imagination of the court.\"  91 Cong.Rec. 11904      (1945) (remarks of Rep. Hancock).\n\n\n13\nSee id. at 11912 (remarks of Rep. Hobbs).\n\n\n14\nIt is inconceivable that, at the same time Congress was so concerned about clearly defining the acts prohibited under the bill it intended to make proof of racketeering\u2014a term not mentioned in the statute\u2014a separate prerequisite to criminal liability under the Hobbs Act.9\n\nIII\n\n15\nWe therefore conclude that respondent's position has no support in either the statute or its legislative history. Respondent also invokes, as did the court below, two maxims of statutory construction, but neither is applicable here.  It is true that \"ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity,\"  Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 812, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 1059, 28 L.Ed.2d 493 (1971), and that, \"unless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state balance,\" United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349, 92 S.Ct. 515, 523, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971).  But here Congress has conveyed its purpose clearly, and we decline to manufacture ambiguity where none exists.  The two maxims only apply \"when we are uncertain about the statute's meaning\";  they are \"not to be used 'in complete disregard of the purpose of the legislature.' \"  Scarborough v. United States, 431 U.S. 563, 577, 97 S.Ct. 1963, 1970, 52 L.Ed.2d 582 (1977), quoting United States v. Bramblett, 348 U.S. 503, 510, 75 S.Ct. 504, 508, 99 L.Ed. 594 (1955).\n\n\n16\nWith regard to the concern about disturbing the federal-state balance, moreover, there is no question that Congress intended to define as a federal crime conduct that it knew was punishable under state law.  The legislative debates are replete with statements that the conduct punishable under the Hobbs Act was already punishable under state robbery and extortion statutes. See, e. g., 91 Cong.Rec. 11848 (1945) (remarks of Rep. Powell); id., at 11900 (remarks of Rep. Hancock);  id., at 11904 (remarks of Rep. Gwynne).  Those who opposed the Act argued that it was a grave interference with the rights of the States.  See, e. g., id., at 11903 (remarks of Rep. Welch);  id., at 11913 (remarks of Rep. Resa).  Congress apparently believed, however, that the States had not been effectively prosecuting robbery and extortion affecting interstate commerce and that the Federal Government had an obligation to do so.  See, e. g., id., at 11911 (remarks of Rep. Jennings);  id., at 11904, 11920 (remarks of Rep. G ynne).\n\n\n17\nOur examination of the statutory language and the legislative history of the Hobbs Act impels us to the conclusion that Congress intended to make criminal all conduct within the reach of the statutory language.  We therefore decline the invitation to limit the statute's scope by reference to an undefined category of conduct termed \"racketeering.\"  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is, accordingly,\n\n\n18\n\nReversed.\n\n\n\n19\nMr. Justice BRENNAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n\n1\n Respondent was also convicted of attempted bank robbery, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (1976 ed.).  In the Court of Appeals, however, the Government confessed error on the ground that \u00a7 2113(a) is not violated unless the taking of the bank's money is \"from the person or presence of another.\"  Since respondent's plan involved the delivery of the money by the bank president to a parking lot and did not contemplate any entry by respondent into the bank or any taking from the person or presence of the president, the Government conceded that the bank robbery conviction should be vacated.  548 F.2d 1355, 1356-1357.\nIn its brief in this Court, the Government notes that \"the United States Attorney's concession was not approved by the Solicitor General and does not represent the position of the Department of Justice on this question.\"  Brief for United States 33 n. 19.  We express no view on the validity of the United States Attorney's interpretation of \u00a7 2113(a).\n\n\n2\n There is a conflict in the Circuits on this issue.  Compare United States v. Culbert, 548 F.2d 1355 (CA9 1977) (case below), and United States v. Yokley, 542 F.2d 300 (CA6 1976), with United States v. Frazier, 560 F.2d 884, 886 (CA8 1977), cert. pending, No. 77-847;  United States v.\nWarledo, 557 F.2d 721, 730 (CA10 1977);  and United States v. Brecht, 540 F.2d 45, 52 (CA2 1976).\n\n\n3\n Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b) (1976 ed.) provides:\n\"As used in this section\u2014\n\"(1) The term 'robbery' means the unlawful taking or obtaining of personal property from the person or in the presence of another, against his will, by means of actual or threatened force, or violence, or fear of injury, immediate or future, to his person or property, or property in his custody or possession, or the person or property of a relative or member of his family or of anyone in his company at the time of the taking or obtaining.\n\"(2) The term 'extortion' means the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.\n\"(3) The term 'commerce' means commerce within the District of Columbia, or any Territory or Possession of the United States; all commerce between any point in a State, Territory, Possession, or the District of Columbia and any point outside thereof;  all commerce between points within the same State through any place outside such State;  and all other commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.\"\n\n\n4\n Although we find the statutory language to be clear, we have often stated that, \"[w]hen aid to construction of the meaning of words, as used in the statute, is available, there certainly can be no 'rule of law' which forbids its use, however clear the words may appear on 'superficial examination.' \"  United States v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 310 U.S. 534, 543-544, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 1064, 84 L.Ed. 1345 (1940) (footnotes omitted).  See Train v. Colorado Public Interest Research Group, Inc., 426 U.S. 1, 10, 96 S.Ct. 1938, 1942, 48 L.Ed.2d 434 (1976);  Cass v. United States, 417 U.S. 72, 77-79, 94 S.Ct. 2167, 2170-2171, 40 L.Ed.2d 668 (1974).\n\n\n5\n The Anti-Racketeering Act provided in pertinent part:\n\"Sec. 2.  Any person who, in connection with or in relation to any act in any way or in any degree affecting trade or commerce or any article or commodity moving or about to move in trade or commerce\u2014\n\"(a) Obtains or attempts to obtain, by the use of or attempt to use or threat to use force, violence, or coercion, the payment of money or other valuable considerations, or the purchase or rental of property or protective services, not including, however, the payment of wages by a bona-fide employer to a bona-fide employee:  or\n\"(b) Obtains the property of another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of force or fear, or under color of official right;  or\n\"(c) Commits or threatens to commit an act of Physical violence or physical injury to a person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to violate sections (a) or (b);  or\n\"(d) Conspires or acts concertedly with any other person or persons to commit any of the foregoing acts;  shall, upon conviction thereof, be guilty of a felony and shall be punished by imprisonment from one to ten years or by a fine of $10,000, or both.\n\"Sec. 3. (a) As used in this Act the term 'wrongful' means in violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State or Territory.\n\"(b) The terms 'property', 'money', or 'valuable considerations' used herein shall not be deemed to include wages paid by a bona-fide employer to a bona-fide employee.\"\n\n\n6\n Although the cited report was issued in 1937, it was intended to provide \"a complete picture\" of the earlier work of the Copeland Committee.  S.Rep.No.1189, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1937).\n\n\n7\n The Hobbs Act also separately proscribes conspiracies.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 (a) (1976 ed.), quoted, supra, at 371-372.\n\n\n8\n There are other indications that Congress did not intend to make criminal liability under the Hobbs Act turn on proof of some additional element of \"racketeering.\"  One Congressman, in enumerating for his colleagues exactly what the Government would have to prove to establish an individual's liability under the bill, made no reference to \"racketeering.\"  91 Cong.Rec. 11903 (1945) (remarks of Rep. Gwynne).  Another emphasized that, with respect to a predecessor bill\u2014one that \"was substantially carried forward into the [Hobbs] Act,\" United States v. Enmons, 410 U.S. 396, 404-405, n. 14, 93 S.Ct. 1007, 1012, 35 L.Ed.2d 379 (1973) Congress was \"trying to make a legal definition of racketeering\" by proscribing specific  onduct in the statute.  89 Cong.Rec. 3227 (1943) (remarks of Rep. Vorys).\n\n\n9\n We note that when Congress wanted to make racketeering an element of an offense, it knew how to do so.  In the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, Pub.L. 91-452, 84 Stat. 922, Congress not only made \"racketeering activity\" an element of a statutory offense, but it specifically defined the term for purposes of the statute.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1) (1976 ed.).  Moreover, the statute defines as \"racketeering activity\" any act which violates certain state laws as well as \"any act which is indictable under  . . . title 18, United States Code  . . .  section 1951\"\u2014the Hobbs Act. \u00a7 1961(1)(B).\n\n\n","label":0}

BERNHARD et al.\nNo. 42.\nArgued Nov. 10, 1969.\nDecided Feb. 2, 1970.\n\nWilliam E. Haudek, New York City, for pertitioners.\nMarvin Schwartz, New York City, for respondents.\nMr. Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe Seventh Amendment to the Constitution provides that in '(s)uits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.' Whether the Amendment guarantees the right to a jury trial in stockholders' derivative actions is the issue now before us.\n\n\n2\nPetitioners brought this derivative suit in federal court against the directors of their closed-end investment company, the Lehman Corporation and the corporation's brokers, Lehman Brothers. They contended that Lehman Brothers controlled the corporation through an illegally large representation on the corporation's board of directors, in violation of the Investment Company Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 789, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a\u20141 et seq., and used this control to extract excessive brokerage fees from the corporation. The directors of the corporation were accused of converting corporate assets and of 'gross abuse of trust, gross misconduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith, (and) gross negligence.' Both the individual defendants and Lehman Brothers were accused of breaches of fiduciary duty. It was alleged that the payments to Lehman Brothers constituted waste and spoliation, and that the contract between the corporation and Lehman Brothers had been violated. Petitioners requested that the defendants 'account for and pay to the Corporation for their profits and gains and its losses.' Petitioners also demanded a jury trial on the corporation's claims.\n\n\n3\nOn motion to strike petitioners' jury trial demand, the District Court held that a shareholder's right to a jury on his corporation's cause of action was to be judged as if the corporation were itself the plaintiff. Only the shareholder's initial claim to speak for the corporation had to be tried to the judge. 275 F.Supp. 569. Convinced that 'there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion as to this question and * * * an immediate appeal would materially advance the ultimate termination of this litigation,' the District Court permitted an interlocutory appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a derivative action was entirely equitable in nature, and no jury was available to try any part of it. 403 F.2d 909. It specifically disagreed with DePinto v. Provident Security Life Ins. Co., 323 F.2d 826 (C.A.9th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, Garsuch v. De P, 376 U.S. 950, 84 S.Ct. 965, 11 L.Ed.2d 969 (1964), on which the District Court had relied. Because of this conflict, we granted certiorari 394 U.S. 917, 89 S.Ct. 1190, 22 L.Ed.2d 450 (1969).\n\n\n4\nWe reverse the holding of the Court of Appeals that in no event does the right to a jury trial preserved by the Seventh Amendment extend to derivative actions brought by the stockholders of a corporation. We hold that the right to jury trial attaches to those issues in derivative actions as to which the corporation, if it had been suing in its own right, would have been entitled to a jury.\n\n\n5\nThe Seventh Amendment preserves to litigants the right to jury trial in suits at common law\u2014\n\n\n6\n'not merely suits, which the common law recognized among its      old and settled proceedings, but suits in which legal rights      were to be ascertained and determined, in contradistinction      to those where equitable rights alone were recognized, and      equitable remedies were administered. * * * In a jury sense,      the amendment then may well be construed to embrace all      suits, which are not of equity and admiralty jurisdiction,      whatever may be the peculiar form which they may assume to      settle legal rights.' Parsons v. Bedford, Breedlove &      Robeson, 3 Pet. 433, 447, 7 L.Ed. 732 (1830).\n\n\n7\nHowever difficult it may have been to define with precision the line between actions at law dealing with legal rights and suits in equity dealing with equitable matters, Whitehead v. Shattuck, 138 U.S. 146, 151, 11 S.Ct. 276, 277, 34 L.Ed. 873 (1891), some proceedings were unmistakably actions at law triable to a jury. The Seventh Amendment, for example, entitled the parties to a jury trial in actions for damages to a person or property, for libel and slander, for recovery of land, and for conversion of personal property.1 Just as clearly, a corporation, although an artificial being, was commonly entitled to sue and be sued in the usual forms of action, at least in its own State. See Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 19 L.Ed. 357 (1869). Whether the corporation was viewed as an entity separate from its stockholders or as a device permitting its stockholders to carry on their business and to sue and be sued, a corporation's suit to enforce a legal right was an action at common law carrying the right to jury trial at the time the Seventh Amendment was adopted.2\n\n\n8\nThe common law refused, however, to permit stockholders to call corporate managers to account in actions at law. The possibilities for abuse, thus presented, were not ignored by corporate officers and directors. Early in the 19th century, equity provided relief both in this country and in England. Without detailing these developments,3 it suffices to say that the remedy in this country, first dealt with by this Court in Dodge v. Woolsey, 18 How. 331, 15 L.Ed. 401 (1856), provided redress not only against faithless officers and directors but also against third parties who had damaged or threatened the corporate properties and whom the corporation through its managers refused to pursue. The remedy made available in equity was the derivative suit, viewed in this country as a suit to enforce a corporate cause of action against officers, directors, and third parties. As elaborated in the cases, one precondition for the suit was a valid claim on which the corporation could have sued; another was that the corporation itself had refused to proceed after suitable demand, unless excused by extraordinary conditions.4 Thus the dual nature of the stockholder's action: first, the plaintiff's right to sue on behalf of the corporation and, second, the merits of the corporation claim itself.5\n\n\n9\nDerivative suits posed no Seventh Amendment problems where the action against the directors and third parties would have been by a bill in equity had the corporation brought the suit. Our concern is with cases based upon a legal claim of the corporation against directors or third parties. Does the trial of such claims at the suit of a stockholder and without a jury violate the Seventh Amendment?\n\n\n10\nThe question arose in this Court in the context of a derivative suit for treble damages under the antitrust laws. Fleitmann v. Welsbach Street Lighting Co., 240 U.S. 27, 36 S.Ct. 233, 60 L.Ed. 505 1916). Noting that the bill in equity set up a claim of the corporation alone, Mr. Justice Holmes observed that if the corporation were the plaintiff, 'no one can doubt that its only remedy would be at law,' and inquired 'why the defendants' right to a jury trial should be taken away because the present plaintiff cannot persuade the only party having a cause of action to sue,\u2014how the liability which is the principal matter can be converted into an incident of the plaintiff's domestic difficulties with the company that has been wronged'? Id., at 28, 36 S.Ct., at 234. His answer was that the bill did not state a good cause of action in equity. Agreeing that there Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23.1, 383 U.S. 1050 right asserted for the company, or the failure of the defendants concerned to insist upon their rights, or a different state system, has led to the whole matter being disposed of in equity,' he concluded that when the penalty of triple damages is sought, the antitrust statute plainly anticipated a jury trial and should not be read as 'attempting to authorize liability to be enforced otherwise than through the verdict of a jury in a court of common law.' Id., at 28\u201429, 36 S.Ct., at 234. Although the decision had obvious Seventh Amendment overtones, its ultimate rationale was grounded in the antitrust laws.6\n\n\n11\nWhere penal damages were not involved, however, there was no authoritative parallel to Fleitmann in the federal system squarely passing on the applicability of the Seventh Amendment to the trial of a legal claim presented in a pre-merger derivative suit. What can be gleaned from this Court's opinions7 is not inconsistent with the general understanding, reflected by the state court decisions and secondary sources, that equity could properly resolve corporate claims of any kind without a jury when properly pleaded in derivative suits complying with the equity rules.8\n\n\n12\nSuch was the prevailing opinion when the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were adopted in 1938. It continued until 1963 when the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, relying on the Federal Rules as construed and applied in Beacon Theatres Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 79 S.Ct. 948, 3 L.Ed.2d 988 (1959), and Dairy Queen Inc. v. Wood, 369 U.S. 469, 82 S.Ct. 894, 8 L.Ed.2d 44 (1962), required the legal issues in a derivative suit to be tried to a jury.9 DePinto v. Provident Security Life Ins. Co., 323 F.2d 826. It was this decision that the District Court followed in the case before us and that the Court of Appeals rejected.\n\n\n13\nBeacon and Dairy Queen presaged DePinto. Under those cases, where equitable and legal claims are joined in the same action, there is a right to jury trial on the legal claims which must not be infringed either by trying the legal issues as incidental to the equitable ones or by a court trial of a common issue existing between the claims. The Seventh Amendment question depends on the nature of the issue to be tried rather than the character of the overall action.10 See Simler v. Conner, 372 U.S. 221, 83 S.Ct. 609, 9 L.Ed.2d 691 (1963). The principle of these cases bears heavily on derivative actions.\n\n\n14\nWe have noted that the derivative suit has dual aspects: first, the stockholder's right to sue on behalf of the corporation, historically an equitable matter; second, the claim of the corporation against directors or third parties on which, if the corporation had sued and the claim presented legal issues, the company could demand a jury trial. As implied by Mr. Justice Holmes in Fleitmann, legal claims are not magically converted into equitable issues by their presentation to a court of equity in a derivative suit. The claim pressed by the stockholder against directors or third parties 'is not his own but the corporation's.' Koster v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 330 U.S. 518, 522, 67 S.Ct. 828, 831 (1947). The corporation is a necessary party to the action; without it the case cannot proceed. Although named a defendant, it is the real party in interest, the stockholder being at best the nominal plaintiff. The proceeds of the action belong to the corporation and it is bound by the result of the suit.11 The heart of the action is the corporate claim. If it presents a legal issue, one entitling the corporation to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment, the right to a jury is not forfeited merely because the stockholder's right to sue must first be adjudicated as an equitable issue triable to the court. Beacon and Dairy Queen require no less.\n\n\n15\nIf under older procedures, now discarded, a court of equity could properly try the legal claims of the corporation presented in a derivative suit, it was because irreparable injury was threatened and no remedy at law existed as long as the stockholder was without standing to sue and the corporation itself refused to pursue its own remedies. Indeed, from 1789 until 1938, the judicial code expressly forbade courts of equity from entertaining any suit for which there was an adequate remedy at law.12 This provision served 'to guard the right of trial by jury preserved by the Seventh Amendment and to that end it should be liberally construed.' Schoenthal v. Irving Trust Co., 287 U.S. 92, 94, 53 S.Ct. 50, 51, 77 L.Ed. 185 (1932). If, before 1938, the law and had borrowed from equity, as it borrowed other things, the idea that stockholders could litigate for their recalcitrant corporation, the corporate claim, if legal, would undoubtedly have been tried to a jury.\n\n\n16\nOf course, this did not occur, but the Federal Rules had a similar impact. Actions are no longer brought as actions at law or suits in equity. Under the Rules there is only one action\u2014a 'civil action'\u2014in which all claims may be joined and all remedies are available. Purely procedural impediments to the presentation of any issue by any party, based on the difference between law and equity, was destroyed. In a civil action presenting a stockholder's derivative claim, the court after passing upon the plaintiff's right to sue on behalf of the corporation is now able to try the corporate claim for damages with the aid of a jury.13 Separable claims may be tried separately, Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 42(b), or legal and equitable issues may be handled in the same trial. Fanchon & Marco, Inc. v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 202 F.2d 731 (C.A.2d Cir. 1953). The historical rule preventing a court of law from entertaining a shareholder's suit on behalf of the corporation is obsolete; it is no longer tenable for a district court, administering both law and equity in the same action, to deny legal remedies to a corporation, merely because the corporation's spokesmen are its shareholders rather than its directors. Under the rules, law and equity are procedurally combined; nothing turns now upon the form of the action or the procedural devices by which the parties happen to come before the court. The 'expansion of adequate legal remedies provided by * * * the Federal Rules necessarily affects the scope of equity.' Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S., at 509, 79 S.Ct., at 956.\n\n\n17\nThus, for example, before-merger class actions were largely a device of equity, and there was no right to a jury even on issues that might, under other circumstances, have been tried to a jury. 5 J. Moore, Federal Practice 38.38(2) (2d ed. 1969); 3B id., 23.02(1). Although at least one post-merger court held that the device was not available to try legal issues,14 it now seems settled in the lower federal courts that class action plaintiffs may obtain a jury trial on any legal issues they present. Montgomery Ward & Co. v. Langer, 168 F.2d 182 (C.A.8th Cir. 1948); see Oskoian v. Canuel, 269 F.2d 311 (C.A.1st Cir. 1959), aff'g 23 F.R.D. 307; Syres v. Oil Workers Int'l Union, Local 23, 257 F.2d 479 (C.A.5th Cir. 1958), cert. denied, 358 U.S. 929, 79 S.Ct. 315, 3 L.Ed.2d 302 (1959). 2 W. Barron & A. Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 571 (Wright ed. 1961).\n\n\n18\nDerivative suits have been described as one kind of 'true' class action. Id., \u00a7 562.1. We are inclined to agree with the description, at least to the extent it recognizes that the derivative suit and the class action were both ways of allowing parties to be heard in equity who could not speak at law.15 3B J. Moore, Federal Practice 23.02(1), 23.1.16(1) (2d ed. 1969). After adoption of the rules there is no longer any procedural obstacle to the assertion of legal rights before juries, however the party may have acquired standing to assert those rights. Given the availability in a derivative action of both legal and equitable remedies, we think the Seventh Amendment preserves to the parties in a stockholder's suit the same right to a jury trial that historically belonged to the corporation and to those against whom the corporation pressed its legal claims.\n\n\n19\nIn the instant case we have no doubt that the corporation's claim is, at least in part, a legal one. The relief sought is money damages. There are allegations in the complaint of a breach of fiduciary duty, but there are also allegations of ordinary breach of contract and gross negligence. The corporation, had it sued on its own behalf, would have been entitled to a jury's determination, at a minimum, of its damages against its broker under the brokerage contract and of its rights against its own directors because of their negligence. Under these circumstances it is unnecessary to decide whether the corporation's other claims are also properly triable to a jury. Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 U.S. 469, 82 S.Ct. 894, 8 L.Ed.2d 44 (1962). The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\n\n\n20\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n21\nDecision of Court of Appeals reversed.\n\n\n22\nMr. Justice STEWART, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice HARLAN join, dissenting.\n\n\n23\nIn holding as it does that the plaintiff in a shareholder's derivative suit is constitutionally entitled to a jury trial, the Court today seems to rely upon some sort of ill-defined combination of the Seventh Amendment and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Somehow the Amendment and the Rules magically interact to do what each separately was expressly intended not to do, namely, to enlarge the right to a jury trial in civil actions brought in the courts of the United States.\n\n\n24\nThe Seventh Amendment, by its terms, does not extend, but merely preserves the right to a jury trial '(i)n Suits at common law.' All agree that this means the reach of the Amendment is limited to those actions that were tried to the jury in 1791 when the Amendment was adopted.1 Suits in equity, which were historically tried to the court, were therefore unaffected by it. Similarly, Rule 38 of the Federal Rules has no bearing on the right to a jury trial in suits in equity, for it simply preserves inviolate '(t)he right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment.' Thus this Rule, like the Amendment itself, neither restricts nor enlarges the right to jury trial.2 Indeed nothing in the Federal Rules can rightly be construed to enlarge the right of jury trial, for in the legislation authorizing the Rules, Congress expressly provided that they 'shall neither abridge, enlarge, nor modify the substantive rights of any litigant.' 48 Stat. 1064. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072. I take this plain, simple, and straight-forward language to mean that after the promulgation of the Federal Rules, as before, the constitutional right to a jury trial attaches only to suits at common law. So, apparently, has every federal court that has discussed the issue.3 Since, as the Court concedes, a shareholder's derivative suit could be brought only in equity, it would seem to me to follow by the most elementary logic that in such suits there is no constitutional right to a trial by jury.4 Today the Court tosses aside history, logic and over 100 years of firm precedent to hold that the plaintiff in a shareholder's derivative suit does indeed have a constitutional right to a trial by jury. This holding has a questionable basis in policy5 and no basis whatever in the Constitution.\n\n\n25\nThe Court begins by assuming the 'dual nature' of the shareholder's action. While the plaintiff's right to get into court at all is conceded to be equitable, once he is there the Court says his claim is to be viewed as though it were the claim of the corporation itself. If the corporation would have been entitled to a jury trial on such a claim, then, it is said, so would the shareholder. This conceptualization is without any historical basis. For the fact is that a shareholder's suit was not originally viewed in this country, or in England, as a suit to enforce a corporate cause of action. Rather, the shareholder's suit was initially permitted only against the managers of the corporation\u2014not third parties\u2014and it was conceived of as an equitable action to enforce the right of a beneficiary against his trustee.6 The shareholder was not, therefore, in court to enforce indirectly the corporate right of action, but to enforce directly his own equitable right of action against an unfaithful fiduciary. Later the rights of the shareholder were enlarged to encompass suits against third parties harming the corporation, but 'the postulated 'corporate cause of action' has never been thought to describe an actual historical class of suit which was recognized by courts of law.'7 Indeed the commentators, including those cited by the Court as postulating the analytic duality of the shareholder's derivative suit, recognize that historically the suit has in practice always been treated as a single cause tried exclusively in equity. They agree that there is therefore no constitutional right to a jury trial even where there might have been one had the corporation itself brought the suit.8\n\n\n26\nThis has been not simply the 'general' or 'prevailing' view in the federal courts as the Court says, but the unanimous view with the single exception of the Ninth Circuit's 1963 decision in DePinto v. Provident Security Life Ins. Co., 323 F.2d 826, a decision that has since been followed by no court until the present case.\n\n\n27\nThe Court would have us discount all those decisions rendered before 1938, when the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were adopted, because it says that before the promulgation of the Rules, '(p)urely procedural impediments' somehow blocked the exercise of a constitutional right. In itself this would seem a rather shaky premise upon which to build an argument. But the Court's position is still further weakened by the fact that any '(p)urely procedural impediments' to a jury trial in a derivative suit were eliminated, not in 1938, but at least as early as 1912. For Rule 23 of the Equity Rules of that year provided that if a 'matter ordinarily determinable at law' arose in an equity suit it should 'be determined in that suit according to the principles applicable, without sending the case or question to the law side of the court.' 226 U.S. 654. These applicable principles included the right of jury trial.9 Consequently, when the Court said in United Copper Co. v. Amalgamated Copper Co., 244 U.S. 261, 264, 37 S.Ct. 509, 510, 61 L.Ed. 1119, that 'it is clear' that the remedy of a stockholder seeking to enforce the rights of a corporation\u2014whatever their nature\u2014is not in law but in equity, it was not because there were 'procedural impediments' to a jury trial on any 'legal issues.' Rather, it was because the suit itself was conceived of as a wholly equitable cause of action.\n\n\n28\nThis was also true in Fleitmann v. Welsbach Street Lighting Co., 240 U.S. 27, 36 S.Ct. 233, 60 L.Ed. 505, on which the Court so heavily relies even though it was a pre-Federal-Rules case. In Fleitmann the plaintiff sued derivatively to enforce a corporate right of action for treble damages under the antitrust laws. Treble damages were considered punitive, and the statute was read to imply a right in the defendant to a jury trial. In his opinion for the Court, Mr. Justice Holmes recognized the potential for abuse: derivative rather than corporate actions could be brought in order to deprive the defendant of his right to a jury trial. The Court's solution was to dismiss the bill because the antitrust statute 'should not be read as attempting to authorize liability to be enforced otherwise than through the verdict of a jury in a court of common law.' Id., at 29, 36 S.Ct., at 234. I do not see how the Court today can draw sustenance from this decision. Rather, the Fleitmann case seems to me to stand for a proposition diametrically opposed to that which the Court seeks to establish; namely, the proposition that because a derivative action is wholly equitable, there is no right to a jury trial. The Court in Fleitmann simply held that since there was a statutory right to a jury in all actions for treble damages under the antitrust laws, a derivative suit seeking such damages could not be maintained. Thus the bill had to be dismissed.10\n\n\n29\nThese pre-1938 cases, then, firmly establish the unitary, equitable basis of shareholders' derivative suits and in no way support the Court's holding here. But, the Court says, whatever the situation may have been before 1938, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure of that year, at least as construed in our decisions more than 20 years later in Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 79 S.Ct. 948, 3 L.Ed.2d 988, and Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 U.S. 469, 82 S.Ct. 894, 8 L.Ed.2d 44, in any event require the conclusion reached today. I can find nothing in either of these cases that leads to that conclusion.\n\n\n30\nIn Beacon Theatres the plaintiff sought both an injunction preventing the defendant from instituting an antitrust action and a declaratory judgment that certain moving picture distribution contracts did not violate the antitrust laws. The defendant answered and counterclaimed for treble damages under the antitrust laws. He demanded a jury trial on the factual issues relating to his counterclaim. The district court held that even though there were factual issues common to both the complaint and the counterclaim, it would first hear the plaintiff's suit for equitable relief before submitting the counterclaim to a jury. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and this Court reversed, upon the ground that if the equitable claim were tried first, there might be an estoppel which would defeat the defendant's right to a full jury trial on all the factual issues raised in his counterclaim. Similarly in Dairy Queen the Court simply held that a plaintiff could not avoid a jury trial by joining legal and equitable causes of action in one complaint.\n\n\n31\nIt is true that in Beacon Theatres it was stated that the 1938 Rules did diminish the scope of federal equity jurisdiction in certain particulars. But the Court's effort to force the facts of this case into the mold of Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen simply does not succeed. Those cases involved a combination of historically separable suits, one in law and one in equity. Their facts fit the pattern of cases where, before the Rules, the equity cases where, before the Rules, the equity court would have disposed of the equitable claim and would then have either retained jurisdiction over the suit, despite the availability of adequate legal remedies, or enjoined a subsequent legal action between the same parties involving the same controversy.11\n\n\n32\nBut the present case is not one involving traditionally equitable claims by one party, and traditionally legal claims by the other. Nor is it a suit in which the plaintiff is asserting a combination of legal and equitable claims. For, as we have seen, a derivative suit has always been conceived of as a single, unitary, equitable cause of action. It is for this reason, and not because of 'procedural impediments,' that the courts of equity did not transfer derivative suits to the law side. In short, the cause of action is wholly a creature of equity. And whatever else can be said of Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen, they did not cast aside altogether the historic division between equity and law.\n\n\n33\nIf history is to be so cavalierly dismissed, the derivative suit can, of course, be artificially broken down into separable elements. But so then can any traditionally equitable cause of action, and the logic of the Court's position would lead to the virtual elimination of all equity jurisdiction. An equitable suit for an injunction, for instance, often involves issues of fact which, if damages had been sought, would have been triable to a jury. Does this mean that in a suit asking only for injunctive relief these factual issues must be tried to the jury, with the judge left to decide only whether, given the jury's findings, an injunction is the appropriate remedy? Certainly the Federal Rules make it possible to try a suit for an injunction in that way, but even more certainly they were not intended to have any such effect. Yet the Court's approach, it seems, would require that if any 'legal issue' procedurally could be tried to a jury, it constitutionally must be tried to a jury.\n\n\n34\nThe fact is, of course, that there are, for the most part, no such things as inherently 'legal issues' or inherently 'equitable issues.' There are only factual issues, and, 'like chameleons (they) take their color from surrounding circumstances.'12 Thus the Court's 'nature of the issue' approach is hardly meaningful.\n\n\n35\nAs a final ground for its conclusion, the Court points to a supposed analogy to suits involving class actions. It says that before the Federal Rules such suits were considered equitable and not triable to a jury, but that since promulgation of the Rules the federal courts have found that 'plaintiffs may obtain a jury trial on any legal issues they present.' Of course the plaintiff may obtain such a trial even in a derivative suit. Nothing in the Constitution or the Rules precludes the judge from granting a jury trial as a matter of discretion. But even if the Court means that some federal courts have ruled that the class action plaintiff in some situations has a constitutional right to a jury trial, the analogy to derivative suits is wholly unpersuasive. For it is clear that the draftsmen of the Federal Rules intended that Rule 23 as it pertained to class actions should be applicable, like other rules governing joinder of claims and parties, 'to all actions, whether formerly denominated legal or equitable.'13 This does not mean that a formerly equitable action is triable to a jury simply because it is brought on behalf of a class, but only that a historically legal cause of action can be tried to a jury even if it is brought as a class action. Since a derivate suit is historically wholly a creation of equity, the class action 'analogy' is in truth no analogy at all.\n\n\n36\nThe Court's decision today can perhaps be explained as a reflection of an unarticulated but apparently overpowering bias in favor of jury trials in civil actions. It certainly cannot be explained in terms of either the Federal Rules or the Constitution.\n\n\n\n1\n See, e.g., Curriden v. Middleton, 232 U.S. 633, 34 S.Ct. 458, 58 L.Ed. 765 (1914); Whitehead v.

Insofar as the stockholders may have been asserting their own direct interest, they closely resemble other class action plaintiffs who could proceed, before merger, only in equity.\n\n\n6\n The dilemma of the stockholder seeking treble damages for the corporation became real and complete in United Copper Co. v. Amalgamated Copper Co., 244 U.S. 261, 37 S.Ct. 509, 61 L.Ed. 1119 (1917), where the stockholder-plaintiff sought treble damages in an action at law. The Court rejected the claim by reiterating the traditional view that a shareholder was without standing to sue at law on a corporate cause. The treble-damage action was a legal proceeding and only the corporation could bring it. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has held that the federal rules have resolved the dilemma and that derivative actions for treble damages under the antitrust laws are now proper. Fanchon & Marco, Inc. v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 202 F.2d 731 (C.A.2d Cir. 1953). Cf. Ramsburg v. American Inv. Co. of Ill., 231 F.2d 333 (C.A.7th Cir. 1956). See generally Comment, Federal Antitrust Law Stockholders' Remedies For Corporate Injury Resulting From Antitrust Violations: Derivative Antitrust Suit and Fiduciary Duty Action, 59 Mich.L.Rev. 904 (1961).\n\n\n7\n For example, in Amalgamated Copper the Court noted that in City of Quincy v. Steel, 120 U.S. 241, 7 S.Ct. 520, 30 L.Ed. 624 (1887), a shareholder's bill in equity that sought to enforce 'a purely legal claim of the corporation,\u2014damages for breach of contract' was dismissed, 'not because the suit should have been at law, but because the bill failed to show that complainant had made sufficient effort to induce the directors to enter suit.' 244 U.S., at 264\u2014265, n. 3, 37 S.Ct., at 511. Delaware & Hudson Co. v. Albany & S.R. Co., supra, n. 4, involved a derivative suit for money damages due under a lease. The stockholders' right to sue was sustained; no jury trial issue appears to have been raised.\n\n\n8\n See, e.g., Goetz v. Manufacturers' & Traders' Trust Co., 154 Misc. 733, 277 N.Y.S. 802 (Sup.Ct.1935); Isaac v. Marcus, 258 N.Y. 257, 179 N.E. 487 (1932); Morton v.

Thompson, Law of Corporations \u00a7 4661 (Supp.1931); 6 Id., \u00a7 4653 (3d ed. 1927).\n\n\n9\n The possibility that the merged federal practice altered the procedures in derivative suits was early recognized, Fanchon & Marco, Inc. v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., supra, n. 6, but until the action of the District Court below DePinto was alone in holding that a right to a jury trial existed in derivative actions. Cf. Richland v. Crandall, 259 F.Supp. 274 (D.C.S.D.N.Y.1966). See also Metcalf v. Shamel, 166 Cal.App.2d 789, 333 P.2d 857 (1959); Steinway v. Griffith Consol. Theatres, 273 P.2d 872 (Okla.1954).\n\n\n10\n As our cases indicate, the 'legal' nature of an issue is determined by considering, first, the pre-merger custom with reference to such questions; second, the remedy sought; and, third, the practical abilities and limitations of juries. Of these factors, the first, requiring extensive and possibly abstruse historical inquiry, is obviously the most difficult to apply. See James, Right to a Jury Trial in Civil Actions, 72 Yale L.J. 655 (1963).\n\n\n11\n See Koster v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 330 U.S. 518, 67 S.Ct. 828, 91 L.Ed. 1067 (1947); Meyer v. Fleming, 327 U.S. 161, 167, 66 S.Ct. 382, 386, 90 L.Ed. 595 (1946); Davenport v. Dows, 18 Wall. 626, 21 L.Ed. 938 (1874).\n\n\n12\n The Judicial Code of 1911, \u00a7 267, 36 Stat. 1163, re-enacting the Act of Sept. 24, 1789, \u00a7 16, 1 Stat. 82, provided: 'Suits in equity shall not be sustained in any court of the United States in any case where a plain, adequate, and complete remedy may be had at law.'\n\n\n13\n It would appear that the same conclusions could have been reached under Equity Rule 23 and the Law and Equity Act of 1915, Act of March 3, 1915, 38 Stat. 956. See Southern R. Co. v. City of Greenwood, 40 F.2d 679 (D.C.W.D.S.C.1928); 2 J. Moore, Federal Practice 2.05 (2d ed. 1967).

Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 43 F.Supp. 735 (D.C.N.D.Iowa 1942).\n\n\n15\n Other equitable devices are used under the rules without depriving the parties employing them of the right to a jury trial on legal issues. For example, although the right to intervene may in some cases be limited, United States for Use and Benefit of Browne & Bryan Lumber Co. v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co., 303 F.2d 823 (C.A.2d Cir. 1962); Dickinson v. Burnham, 197 F.2d 973 (C.A.2d Cir.), cert. denied 344 U.S. 875, 73 S.Ct. 169, 97 L.Ed. 678 (1952), when intervention is permitted generally, the intervenor has a right to a jury trial on any legal issues he presents. See 3B J. Moore, Federal Practice 24.16(7) (2d ed. 1969); 5 id., 38.38(3). A similar development seems to be taking place in the lower courts in interpleader actions. Before merger interpleader actions lay only in equity, and there was no right to a jury even on issues that might, under other circumstances, have been tried to a jury. Liberty Oil Co. v. Condon Nat. Bank, 260 U.S. 235, 43 S.Ct. 118, 67 L.Ed. 232 (1922). This view continued for some time after merger, see Bynum v. Prudential Life Ins. Co., 7 F.R.D. 585 (D.C.E.D.S.C.1947), but numerous courts and commentators have now come to the conclusion that the right to a jury should not turn on how the parties happen to be brought into court. See Pan American Fire & Cas. Co. v. Revere, 188 F.Supp. 474 (D.C.E.D.La.1960); Savannah Bank & Trust Co. v. Block, 175 F.Supp. 798 (D.C.S.D.Ga.1959); Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. United Elec. Radio & Mach. Workers of America, 99 F.Supp. 597 (D.C.W.D.Pa.1951); John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Yarrow, 95 F.Supp. 185 (D.C.E.D.Pa.1951); 2 W. Barron & A. Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 556 (Wright ed. 1961); 3A J. Moore, Federal Practice 22.14(4) (2d ed. 1969). But see Pennsylvania Fire Ins. Co. v. American Airlines, Inc., 180 F.Supp. 239 (D.C.E.D.N.Y.1960); Liberty Nat. Life Ins. Co. v. Brown, 119 F.Supp. 920 (D.C.M.D.Ala.1954).\n\n\n1\n Where a new cause of action is created by Congress, and nothing is said about how it is to be tried, the jury trial issue is determined by fitting the cause into its nearest historical analogy. Luria v. United States, 231 U.S. 9, 34 S.Ct. 10, 58 L.Ed. 101; see James, Right to a Jury Trial in Civil Actions, 72 Yale L.J. 655.\n\n\n2\n See, e.g., Ettelson v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 3 Cir., 137 F.2d 62, 65; 5 J. Moore, Federal Practice 38.07(1) and cases cited therein.\n\n\n3\n The principle that the Rules effected no enlargement or restriction of the right of jury trial has 'received complete judicial approbation.' 5 J. Moore, Federal Practice 38.07(1) and cases cited therein.\n\n\n4\n Virtually every state and federal court that has faced this issue has similarly reasoned to the same conclusion. See, e.g., Goetz v. Manufacturers' & Traders' Trust Co., 154 Misc. 733, 277 N.Y.S. 802 (Sup.Ct.); Metcalf v. Shamel, 166 Cal.App.2d 789, 333 P.2d 857; Liken v. Shaffer, D.C., 64 F.Supp. 432; Miller v. Weiant, D.C., 42 F.Supp. 760. The equitable nature of the derivative suit has been recognized in several decisions of this Court. See, e.g., Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 547\u2014548, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1226, 93 L.Ed. 1528. It was also reflected in the adoption of Equity Rule 94 in 1882, and Rule 27 of the Equity Rules of 1912 which established the preconditions to bringing shareholders' derivative suits in the federal courts. These rules are the forerunners of Rule 23(b) of Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. of 1938, and of Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23.1 (1966), which now controls the initiation of such suits. See 3B. J. Moore, Federal Practice 23.1.15(1).\n\n\n5\n See, e.g., Frank, Courts on Trial 110\u2014111 (1949). Certainly there is no consensus among commentators on the desirability of jury trials in civil actions generally. Particularly where the issues in the case are complex\u2014as they are likely to be in a derivative suit\u2014much can be said for allowing the court discretion to try the case itself.

{"text":"349 U.S. 302\n75 S.Ct. 757\n99 L.Ed. 1107\nCarlos MARCELLO, Petitioner,v.John M. BONDS, Officer in Charge, United States  Immigration and NaturalizationService.\nNo. 145.\nArgued April 21, 1955.\nDecided May 31, 1955.\n\nMessrs. Jack Wasserman, David Carliner, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nMr. Robert W. Ginnane, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nMr. Justice CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner, a native of Tunis, Africa, was ordered deported after a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 209, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(b). It was found that he had been convicted in 1938 of violation of the Marihuana Tax Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2591, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2591, and sentenced to imprisonment for one year. Section 241(a) (11) of the 1952 immigration law1 makes such conviction at any time ground for deportation, and \u00a7 241(d)2 provides that the deportation provisions of \u00a7 241(a) shall apply even though the facts giving rise to the alien's deportability occurred prior to the date of enactment of the 1952 Act.\n\n\n2\nAt the hearing before a special inquiry officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, petitioner did not dispute the fact of his conviction. He did, however, object to the proceedings on the ground that they violated due process and the Administrative Procedure Act, 60 Stat. 237, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq., 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001, et seq. The hearing officer overruled these objections. Petitioner also contended that the ex post facto cause of the Constitution precluded the retroactive application of the 1952 law to his case. This contention too was rejected by the hearing officer. Petitioner and his counsel were advised of their right to apply to the Attorney General for the discretionary relief of suspension of deportation under \u00a7 244(a)(5) of the Act.3 At first they declined to do so, but subsequently they moved to reopen the hearing to apply for such relief. The special inquiry officer denied the motion. On appeal, the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the order of deportation. Though no formal application for suspension of deportation under \u00a7 244(a)(5) had been filed, the Board considered whether such relief was merited but exercised its discretion against the remission.\n\n\n3\nPetitioner then brought this action for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging the validity of the deportation order on the grounds, inter alia: (1) that the hearing under \u00a7 242(b) of the Act failed to comply with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act in that the special inquiry officer was under the supervision and control of officials in the Immigration Service who performed investigative and prosecuting functions; (2) that \u00a7 242(b) violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it failed to provide for a fair and impartial hearing; (3) that on the date of petitioner's arrest the Attorney General made a public statement, which 'was bound to have great effect upon the special inquiry officer,' to the effect that petitioner was an undesirable citizen for whose deportation the proceedings were 'specially designed,' and, further, that in 1952 the Attorney General 'prepared a list of 152 persons (including petitioner) whom he desired to deport'; and (4) that the retroactive application of \u00a7 241(a)(11) was unconstitutional as an ex post facto law.\n\n\n4\nThe Government's return to the writ alleged that petitioner's deportation had been conducted in accordance with the Constitution, laws and regulations of the United States. No evidence was introduced by either side save the official Immigration Service record of petitioner's deportation proceedings. The District Court held the deportation order valid and discharged the writ. United States ex rel. Marcello v. Ahrens, 113 F.Supp. 22. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Marcello v. Ahrens, 5 Cir., 212 F.2d 830. Petitioner pursues his four basic objections in this Court, certiorari having been granted to resolve issues having a significant bearing on the administration of our immigration laws. 348 U.S. 805, 75 S.Ct. 39.\n\n\n5\nApplicability of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n\n6\nPetitioner concedes that \u00a7 242(b) of the Immigration Act, authorizing the appointment of a 'special inquiry officer' to preside at the deportation proceedings, does not conflict with the Administrative Procedure Act, since \u00a7 7(a) of that Act excepts from its terms officers specially provided for or designated pursuant to other statutes.4 He insists, however, that there are several significant discrepancies between the Acts, and claims that in cases of variance the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act must govern unless those of the Immigration Act 'shall * * * expressly' negate their application. Administrative Procedure Act, \u00a7 12. The discrepancies relied on stem from the 'separation of functions' provision of \u00a7 5(c), of the Administrative Procedure Act. To the extent her material, this section separates investigative and prosecuting functions from those of adjudication, expressly providing that hearing officers shall not be responsible to or under the supervision of those engaged in investigation and prosecution. The section also prohibits the hearing officer from participating or advising in the decision of a case, or one factually related thereto, in which he has performed investigative or prosecuting functions. Section 242(b) of the Immigration Act, on the other hand, permits the 'special inquiry officer' to take the dual role of prosecutor and hearing officer\u2014presenting evidence and interrogating witnesses and prohibits him only from hearing cases which he has taken some part in investigating or prosecuting (other than in the permitted dual capacity). An alternative method is permitted by \u00a7 242(b), however, under which an additional immigration officer presents the evidence while the special inquiry officer presides. See 8 CFR \u00a7 242.53. Special inquiry officers are subject to such supervision as the Attorney General prescribes, 66 Stat. 171, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(b)(4), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101(b)(4), and at present they are subject to the supervision of district directors of the immigration districts to which they are assigned, as well as higher Service officials, all with enforcement responsibilities of the type proscribed by \u00a7 5(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n\n7\nUnder the allegations here made, the single attack of the petitioner pertains to the supervision of the special inquiry officer by the investigative and prosecuting officials of the Immigration Service. The alternative procedure of \u00a7 242(b) was employed in this case, so the presiding officer did not undertake the functions of prosecutor; and there is no allegation that he engaged in investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related case. For the sake of clarity, however, we shall consider all of the differences in the hearing provisions of the two Acts in determining whether the Administrative Procedure Act is to govern.\n\n\n8\nThe applicability of the Administrative Procedure Act to deportation proceedings under the Immigration Act of 1917 was considered by this Court in Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 1950, 339 U.S. 33, 70 S.Ct. 445, 94 L.Ed. 616. We there held, contrary to the prevailing interpretation and practice of the Department of Justice, that deportation hearings were subject to the Act. Six months later, Congress provided in the Supplemental Appropriation Act of 1951, 64 Stat. 1048, that proceedings directed toward the exclusion or expulsion of aliens should not be governed by \u00a7\u00a7 5, 7 and 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act. The issue here presented is whether the Congress reversed itself in the 1952 Immigration Act and in effect reinstated the Sung case by making the hearing provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act directly applicable to deportation proceedings. A comparison of the pertinent provisions of the two statutes is perhaps the strongest indication that the Congress had no such intention.\n\n\n9\n1. Section 242(b) of the Immigration Act begins by enumerating the functions of the special inquiry officer, that he shall administer oaths, receive evidence, etc. A similar though more extensive and detailed provision appears in \u00a7 7(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, but of course this section makes no mention of functions stemming from the special inquiry officer's dual role as prosecutor and judge.\n\n\n10\n2. Section 242(b) then directs that a determination of deportability be made only upon the record of a proceeding at which the alien had a reasonable opportunity to be present. A similar direction as to the record appears in \u00a7 7(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act, and as to the party's personal appearance in \u00a7 6(a).\n\n\n11\n3. Section 242(b) then deals with matters peculiar to deportation proceedings, which have no direct analogues in the Administrative Procedure Act: safeguards to be established to protect mentally incompetent aliens; the right of the inquiry officer to proceed if the alien deliberately absents himself; the option to pursue the alternative procedure, described above, in which one official prosecutes and another decides.\n\n\n12\n4. Next in \u00a7 242(b) is the limitation already noted on the special inquiry officer's sitting in the same case in which he has also engaged in investigative or prosecuting functions. The more restrictive analogue in \u00a7 5(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act has also been presented.\n\n\n13\n5. Section 242(b) then sets forth various requirements which are to be included in regulations governing deportation proceedings before the special inquiry officer. The first of these gives the alien the right to reasonable notice of the charges against him and of the time and place at which the proceedings shall be held. A similar requirement appears in \u00a7 5(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n\n14\n6. The second provision which \u00a7 242(b) requires to be included in the regulations is the privilege of the alien to be represented by counsel of his own choosing. Section 6(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act bestows a similar privilege on any person compelled to appear in person before the agency.\n\n\n15\n7. The regulations under \u00a7 242(b) must also provide that the alien be given a reasonable opportunity to present and examine evidence and to cross-examine witnesses. The same ground is covered in \u00a7 7(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n\n16\n8. The regulations promulgated under \u00a7 242(b) must require that decisions of deportability be based upon reasonable, substantial and probative evidence. To the same effect is \u00a7 7(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n\n17\n9. Finally, in addition to the requirements of \u00a7 242(b), there is the direction of \u00a7 101(b)(4) of the Immigration Act that the special inquiry officer shall be subject to such supervision as the Attorney General shall prescribe. This covers the same question as the portion of \u00a7 5(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act dealing with the supervision and control of hearing officers.\n\n\n18\nFrom the Immigration Act's detailed coverage of the same subject matter dealt with in the hearing provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is clear that Congress was setting up a specialized administrative procedure applicable to deportation hearings, drawing liberally on the analogous provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act and adapting them to the particular needs of the deportation process. The same legislators, Senator McCarran and Congressman Walter, sponsored both the Administrative Procedure Act and the Immigration Act, and the framework of the latter indicates clearly that the Administrative Procedure Act was being used as a model. But it was intended only as a model, and when in this very particularized adaptation there was a departure from the Administrative Procedure Act\u2014based on novel features in the deportation process\u2014surely it was the intention of the Congress to have the deviation apply and not the general model. Were the courts to ignore these provisions and look only to the Administrative Procedure Act, the painstaking efforts detailed above would be completely meaningless. Congress could have accomplished as much simply by stating that there should be a hearing to determine the question of deportability.\n\n\n19\nSection 242(b) expressly states: 'The procedure (herein prescribed) shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining the deportability of an alien under this section.' That this clear and categorical direction was meant to exclude the application of the Administrative Procedure Act is amply demonstrated by the legislative history of the Immigration Act. The original bills included statements to the effect that the \u00a7 242(b) procedures were to be exclusive, '(n)otwithstanding any other law, including the (Administrative Procedure Act).' S. 3455, 81st Cong., 2d Sess.; S. 716, 82d Cong., 1st Sess.; H.R. 2379, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. The 'notwithstanding' clause was dropped in later versions of the Act and did not appear in the bills reported out of committee or in the statute as finally enacted. S. 2055, 82d Cong.; H.R. 5678, 82d Cong.; S. 2550, 82d Cong. The deletion is nowhere explained, but it is possible that the phrase was considered unnecessary\u2014and perhaps inappropriate as a description as \u00a7 242(b) became more detailed, encompassing in its particularization the greater part of the Administrative Procedure Act's hearing provisions. In the Senate Report accompanying the revised bill, it is stated that \u00a7 242(b) sets up special procedures for deportation proceedings, that these are made exclusive, and that the exemption from the Administrative Procedure Act in the Supplemental Appropriation Act of 1951 is repealed because it is 'no longer necessary.' S.Rep. No. 1137, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 28. The House Report is to the same effect, stating that the prescribed deportation proceedings shall be the sole and exclusive procedure, 'notwithstanding the provisions of any other law.' H.R.Rep. No. 1365, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 58. Throughout the debates it is made clear that the Administrative Procedure Act does not apply directly, but that its provisions have been specially adapted to meet the needs of the deportation process. See particularly the detailed statement of Senator McCarran, 98 Cong.Rec. 5625\u20145626, wherein he recognizes a departure from the 'dual-examiner provisions' of the Administrative Procedure Act, the very section here in issue.\n\n\n20\nExemptions from the terms of the Administrative Procedure Act are not lightly to be presumed in view of the statement in \u00a7 12 of the Act that modifications must be express, cf. Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U.S. 48, 75 S.Ct. 591. But we cannot ignore the background of the 1952 immigration legislation, its laborious adaptation of the Administrative Procedure Act to the deportation process, the specific points at which deviations from the Administrative Procedure Act were made, the recognition in the legislative history of this adaptive technique and of the particular deviations, and the direction in the statute that the methods therein prescribed shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for deportation proceedings. Unless we are to require the Congress to employ magical passwords in order to effectuate an exemption from the Administrative Procedure Act, we must hold that the present statute expressly supersedes the hearing provisions of that Act. The Hearing Procedures and Due Process.\n\n\n21\nAs noted above, the only complaint which petitioner can urge concerning the hearing procedures in this case is the objection that the special inquiry officer was subject to the supervision and control of officials in the Immigration Service charged with investigative and prosecuting functions. Petitioner would have us hold that the presence of this relationship so strips the hearing of fairness and impartiality as to make the procedure violative of due process. The contention is without substance when considered against the long-standing practice in deportation proceedings, judicially approved in numerous decisions in the federal courts, and against the special considerations applicable to deportation which the Congress may take into account in exercising its particularly broad discretion in immigration matters.\n\n\n22\nThe Claim of Prejudgment.\n\n\n23\nOur opinions in the Accardi cases stand for the proposition that the Attorney General cannot, under present regulations, dictate the actions of the Board of Immigration Appeals. United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 74 S.Ct. 499, 98 L.Ed. 681; Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Accardi, 349 U.S. 280, 75 S.Ct. 746. Petitioner alleges that his case was prejudged within the meaning of these decisions because on the day of his arrest for deportation the Attorney General 'announced in a public statement5 both in Washington and in New Orleans that (petitioner) was an undesirable citizen and had been guilty of many crimes, and that the proceedings were specially designed to deport petitioner,' and that 'such publicity was bound to have great effect upon the special inquiry officer.' He alleged, further, that 'the Attorney General some time in 1952 prepared a list of 152 persons whom he desired to deport, and that (his) name was included on this list.'\n\n\n24\nConsidering first the alleged list, it is clear that petitioner has not made out a case of prejudgment. He did not allege that either the inquiry officer or the Board of Immigration Appeals had seen the list, had known of its existence, or had been influenced in their decisions by the inclusion of petitioner's name thereon. In argument before the Board, petitioner stated through counsel that he had 'the feeling\u2014and it's a feeling that's based upon evidence which we will supply\u2014that the real basis for the denial of suspension here was the fact that Marcello was one of these hundred whom the Attorney General had named * * *.' No evidence of this was forthcoming. As to petitioner's charges concerning the Attorney General's 'list,' the record is completely barren.\n\n\n25\nNor does petitioner fare better in seeking to base prejudgment on the unfavorable publicity accompanying his arrest. He introduced newspaper clippings into evidence to show the adverse local publicity and alleged that this publicity must have had a 'great effect' upon the special inquiry officer. But the record indicates clearly that petitioner's case could not possibly have been prejudiced in the hearing before the inquiry officer. On the question of petitioner's deportability, the sole issue decided by him, the hearing officer merely applied the statute to the undisputed facts. Petitioner admitted that he was deportable under the Immigration Act of 1952 if the Act could constitutionally base deportation on his 1938 marihuana conviction. And the hearing officer could be expected in any event to take the law as Congress enacted it. In view of this Court's decisions on the ex post facto objection, the only ground of attack, he could do nothing else. Petitioner waived the only issue on which prejudgment was possible when he declined to apply for discretionary relief at the proper time. See 8 CFR \u00a7 242.54(d).\n\n\n26\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals considered the availability of discretionary relief, but as to these officials there was not even an allegation by petitioner that they had known of the unfavorable publicity or had been influenced by it. Indeed, there is every indication that the Board had not prejudged the case, since it considered the question of suspending deportation on the merits although not bound to do so in view of petitioner's waiver below. The Board denied the requested relief, giving reasons. It is not for us in this proceeding to pass on the factors relied on by the Board in reaching its conclusion. It is sufficient to observe that all had basis in the record and that none stemmed from any sort of dictation by the Attorney General.\n\n\n27\nFinally, we note that, even as to his claim relating to adverse publicity, petitioner introduced no evidence other than the newspaper clippings. Surely on this meager showing the district judge was warranted in finding\u2014as he did\u2014that the special inquiry officer, the only official mentioned in petitioner's pleadings, was not controlled in his decision by superiors in the Department of Justice. The decision of the district judge cannot be set aside as clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we hold that under our Accardi decisions petitioner has failed to make out a case for a new hearing. Ex Post Facto.\n\n\n28\nPetitioner's last objection stems from the fact that his conviction under the Marihuana Tax Act was not ground for deportation at the time he committed the offense, and that he was not forewarned of all the consequences of his criminal conduct. It is urged that we depart from our recent decisions holding that the prohibition of the ex post facto clause does not apply to deportation, and strike down as unconstitutional the retroactive application of the new grounds for deportation in \u00a7 241(a)(11) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. We perceive no special reasons, however, for overturning our precedents on this matter, and adhere to our decisions in Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 74 S.Ct. 737, 98 L.Ed. 911, and Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 72 S.Ct. 512, 96 L.Ed. 586.\n\n\n29\nAffirmed.\n\n\n30\nMr. Justice HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n31\nMr. Justice BLACK, with whom Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER joins, dissenting.\n\n\n32\nPetitioner was lawfully brought to this country forty-four years ago when he was eight months old and has resided here ever since. He is married and has four children. His wife and children are American citizens. It is settled that he cannot be deported without being accorded a fair hearing in accordance with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.1\n\n\n33\nA fair hearing necessarily includes an impartial tribunal. Petitioner claims that the circumstances here deprived him of that kind of tribunal. The officer who conducted the hearings, decided the case and made recommendations for deportation was connected with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. This hearing officer was subject to the supervision, direction and control of the Attorney General and his subordinate supervisory officers of the Immigration Service who perform investigative and prosecutorial functions. Thus the hearing officer adjudicated the very case against petitioner which the hearing officer's superiors initiated and prosecuted. Petitioner's argument is that requiring him to have his cause adjudicated by such a subordinate of the prosecutors deprives him of due process. This due process challenge cannot be lightly dismissed, but I find it unnecessary to rest my dissent on a determination of that question. For Congress in the Administrative Procedure Act2 has barred hearing officers from adjudicating cases under the circumstances here, and I think that Act is applicable to this case.\n\n\n34\nSection 5(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act forbids hearing officers covered by the Act to conduct hearings if they are 'responsible to or subject to the supervision or direction of any officer, employee, or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions for any agency.' In 1950 we held in Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U.S. 33, 70 S.Ct. 445, 94 L.Ed. 616, that deportation proceedings must be conducted as required by \u00a7 5. Congress, however, later in 1950, put a rider on an appropriation bill providing that 'Proceedings under law relating to the exclusion or expulsion of aliens shall hereafter be without regard to the provisions of sections 5, 7, and 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act.'3 Were this express modification of the Procedure Act still in effect, we would have to reach the constitutional question raised by petitioner. But this appropriation rider was repealed in the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act.4 The result of this repeal was to leave \u00a7 5(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act applicable to immigration cases unless, as the Government contends, other provisions of the 1952 Immigration Act made the Procedure Act inapplicable. I think this contention of the Government should not be sustained.\n\n\n35\nSection 12 of the Administrative Procedure Act provides that 'No subsequent legislation shall be held to supersede or modify the provisions of this Act except to the extent that such legislation shall do so expressly.' The 1950 appropriation rider was an express modification of the prior Procedure Act, but unlike the Court I find no such express modification in the 1952 Immigration Act. Indeed that Act's legislative sponsors disclaimed any purpose to bring about even an implied modification.\n\n\n36\nBoth the Procedure Act and the 1952 Immigration Act were sponsored by Senator McCarran and Representative Walter. Their original proposals which finally evolved into the 1952 Act did expressly provide that the Procedure Act should not control proceedings under the Immigration Act. The provision was that 'Notwithstanding any other law, including the Act of June 11, 1946 (the Administrative Procedure Act), the proceedings so prescribed shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining the deportability of an alien who is in the United States'.5 Hearings on these proposals brought strong protests from some organizations, including the American Bar Association, against the provision making the Administrative Procedure Act inapplicable to deportation proceedings.6 Afterwards the sponsors of the immigration measures introduced new bills which significantly omitted from that provision the words 'Notwithstanding any other law, including the Act of June 11, 1946 (the Administrative Procedure Act).' Consequently when the bill finally passed there was no language which 'expressly' superseded or modified the binding requirement of \u00a7 5(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n\n37\nSenators who voted for the new version which became the 1952 Immigration Act were assured by the senatorial sponsor:\n\n\n38\n'The Administrative Procedure Act is made applicable to the      bill. The Administrative Procedure Act prevails now. * * *      The bill provides for administrative procedures and makes the      Administrative Procedure Act applicable insofar as the      administration of the bill is concerned.'7\n\n\n39\nAnd House members voting for the 1952 Immigration Act were assured by its House sponsor:\n\n\n40\n'Instead of destroying the Administrative Procedures Act, we      undo what the Congress did in a deficiency appropriation bill several years ago when it legislated to      overturn a decision of the Supreme Court, which ruled that      the Administrative Procedures Act is applicable in      deportation proceedings. We undo that. So here, instead of      our destroying the Administrative Procedures Act, we actually      see that it is reinstated in every instance.'8\n\n\n41\nReassuring the House again the next day, Representative Walter said:\n\n\n42\n'We have been very zealous to see that the philosophy      underlying that act (Administrative Procedure) is embodied in      this measure. I am sure that if the gentleman will look at      page 163, paragraph 46, he will find that the law as it was      before the House adopted this amendment to an appropriation      bill, has been reinstated and that the decision of the      Supreme Court in the Sung case will be the law of the land      when this code is adopted.'9\n\n\n43\nAs previously pointed out the Sung case held that \u00a7 5(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act did apply to deportation cases.\n\n\n44\nOther statements in the discussions of the 1952 Act may look in a different direction from the statements just quoted. But whatever was said, no language in the 1952 Immigration Act expressly authorizes deportation cases to be heard, contrary to the Administrative Procedure Act, by hearing officers who are the dependent subordinates of the immigration agency's prosecutorial staff. The idea of letting a prosecutor judge the very case he prosecutes or supervise and control the job of the judge before whom his case is presented is wholly inconsistent with our concepts of justice. It was this principle on which Congress presumably acted in passing the Procedure Act. Only the other day we had pointed out to us an instance in which the immigration authorities had relieved an immigration hearing officer from his duties because they believed that the hearing officer had failed adequately to present available derogatory information against an alien.10 It is hard to defend the fairness of a practice that subjects judges to the power and control of prosecutors. Human nature has not put an impassable barrier between subjection and subserviency, particularly when job security is at stake. That Congress was aware of this is shown by the Procedure Act, and we should not construe the Immigration Act on a contrary assumption.\n\n\n45\nI would reverse this case.\n\n\n46\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\n\n47\nThe Constitution places a ban on all ex post facto laws. There are no qualifications or exceptions. Article I, \u00a7 9, applicable to the Federal Government, speaks in absolute terms: 'No * * * ex post facto Law shall be passed.'1 The prohibition is the same whether a citizen or an alien is the victim. So far as ex post facto laws are concerned, the prohibition is all-inclusive and complete.\n\n\n48\nThere is a school of thought that the Ex Post Facto Clause includes all retroactive legislation, civil as well as criminal. See Crosskey, Politics and the Constitution, Vol. I, c. XI; Vol. II, p. 1053. Mr. Justice Johnson took that view, maintaining that a restriction of the Clause to criminal acts was unwarranted. See Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 271, 286, 6 L.Ed. 606; Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Pet. 380, 416, 681, 7 L.Ed. 458 (Appendix). The Court, however, has stated over and again since Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 1 L.Ed. 648, that the Ex Post Facto Clause applies only in criminal cases. See Carpenter v. Commonwealth, 17 How. 456, 463, 15 L.Ed. 127; Johannessen v. United States, 225 U.S. 227, 242, 32 S.Ct. 613, 617, 56 L.Ed. 1066; Bugajewitz v. Adams, 228 U.S. 585, 591, 33 S.Ct. 607, 608, 57 L.Ed. 978; Mahler v. Eby, 264 U.S. 32, 39, 44 S.Ct. 283, 286, 68 L.Ed. 549.\n\n\n49\nAt the same time, there was a parallel development in the field of ex post facto legislation. Chief Justice Marshall in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 138\u2014139, 3 L.Ed. 162, refused to construe the Ex Post Facto Clause narrowly and restrict it to criminal prosecutions. The Fletcher case held that property rights that had vested could not be displaced by legislative fiat. That liberal view persisted. It was given dramatic application in post-Civil War days. The leading cases are Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 18 L.Ed. 356, and Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333, 18 L.Ed. 366, where the right to practice a person's profession was sought to be taken away, in the first case by a State, in the second by the Federal Government, for acts which carried no such penalty when they were committed. The essence of those proceedings was the revocation of a license. Yet the Court held them to be violative of the Ex Post Facto Clauses because they were 'punishment' for acts carrying no such sanctions when done.\n\n\n50\nDeportation may be as severe a punishment as loss of livelihood. See Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135, 154, 65 S.Ct. 1443, 1452, 89 L.Ed. 2103; Delgadillo v. Carmichael, 332 U.S. 388, 391, 68 S.Ct. 10, 12, 92 L.Ed. 17. As Mr. Justice Brandeis stated in Ng Fung Ho v. White, 259 U.S. 276, 284, 42 S.Ct. 492, 495, 66 L.Ed. 938, deportation may result 'in loss of both property and life, or of all that makes life worth living.'\n\n\n51\nI find nothing in the Constitution exempting aliens from the operation of ex post facto laws. I would think, therefore, that, if Congress today passed a law making any alien who had ever violated any traffic law in this country deportable, the law would be ex post facto. Congress, of course, has broad powers over the deportation of aliens. See Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, 72 S.Ct. 512, 96 L.Ed. 586. But the bare fact of a traffic violation would not reasonably be regarded as demonstrating that such a person was presently an undesirable resident. It would relate solely to an historic incident that carried no such punishment when committed. The present Act has the same vice. The alien is not deported after a hearing and on a finding by the authorities that he is undesirable for continued residence here. It is the bare past violation of the narcotic laws that is sufficient and conclusive, however isolated or insignificant such violation may have been. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1251. The case is, therefore, different from the earlier deportation cases where the past acts were mere counters in weighing present fitenss.2\n\n\n52\nIn the absence of a rational connection between the imposition of the penalty of deportation and the present desirability of the alien as a resident in this country, the conclusion is inescapable that the Act merely adds a new punishment for a past offense. That is the injustice that the Ex Post Facto Clause was designed to prevent.\n\n\n\n1\n 66 Stat. 204, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(11), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1251(a)(11).\n\n\n2\n 66 Stat. 208, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(d), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1251(d).\n\n\n3\n 66 Stat. 214, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(5), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1254(a)(5).\n\n\n4\n Section 7(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act directs that, in general, administrative hearings shall be held before hearing officers appointed pursuant to \u00a7 11 of the Act.\n\n\n5\n Petitioner introduced clippings appearing in New Orleans newspapers relating to the statement.

Such a conviction is a deportable offense under the new Immigration and Nationality Act.\n'The action follows lengthy investigations by both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. His conviction under the Marijuana Act was one of only two in his checkered career. The other case in which he was convicted was under Louisiana State law, the conviction being for assault and robbery, and on May 13, 1930, he was sentenced to serve a term of 9 to 14 years in the Louisiana State Penitentiary.

A three-judge District Court, relying on Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 36 L.Ed.2d 583, concluded that the challenged mandatory-discharge provisions are supported solely by considerations of fiscal and administrative policy, and upheld appellee's claim. Held: The challenged legislative classification is completely rational and does not violate the Due Process Clause. Pp. 505\u2014510.\n(a) The different treatment of men and women naval officers under \u00a7\u00a7 6382 and 6401 results, not from mere administrative or fiscal convenience, but from the fact that female line officers because of restrictions on their participating in combat and most sea duty do not have opportunities for professional service equal to those of male line officers, and Congress could rationally conclude that a longer period of tenure for women officers comported with the goal of providing women officers with 'fair and equitable career advancement programs.'

Khoury, Jr., San Diego, Cal., for appellee.\nMr. Justice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nAppellee Robert C. Ballard is a lieutenant in the United States Navy. After more than nine years of active service as a commissioned officer, he failed, for a second time, to be selected for promotion to the grade of lieutenant commander, and was therefore subject to mandatory discharge under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6382(a).1 He brought suit in federal court claiming that if he had been a woman officer, he would have been subject to a different separation statute, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6401, under which he would have been entitled to 13 years of commissioned service before a mandatory discharge for want of promotion.2 He claimed that the application of \u00a7 6382 to him, when compared with the treatment of women officers subject to \u00a7 6401, was an unconstitutional discrimination based on sex in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.3\n\n\n2\nThe District Judge issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting Ballard's discharge. Subsequently, a three-judge District Court was convened to hear the claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2282, 2284. After hearings upon motions by the Government defendants, that court issued a preliminary injunction against Ballard's discharge. 350 F.Supp. 167. Thereafter, the case came before the three-judge court for decision on the merits. Relying upon Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 36 L.Ed.2d 583, and concluding that the challenged mandatory-discharge provisions are supported solely by considerations of fiscal and administrative policy, the court held that \u00a7 6382 is unconstitutional because the 13-year tenure provision of \u00a7 6401 discriminates in favor of women without sufficient justification. 360 F.Supp. 643. Accordingly, the court enjoined the Navy from discharging Ballard for failure to be promoted to the grade of lieutenant commander before the expiration of 13 years of commissioned service. Id., at 648. We noted probable jurisdiction of this appeal from that injunctive order. 415 U.S. 912, 94 S.Ct. 1405, 39 L.Ed.2d 465. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253.\n\n\n3\n* At the base of the system governing the promotion and attrition of male line officers on the Navy is a congressional designation of the authorized number of the Navy's enlisted personnel, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 5401, and a correlative limitation upon the number of active line officers as a percentage of that figure. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 5403.4 Congress has also established the ratio of distribution of line officers in the several grades above lieutenant in fixed proportions to the total number of line officers. \u00a7\u00a7 5442, 5447(a).\n\n\n4\nThe Secretary of the Navy is required periodically to convene selection boards to consider and recommend for promotion male line officers in each of the separate ranks, \u00a7 5701, and must provide the boards so convened with the number of male line officers that may be recommended for promotion to the next higher grade. \u00a7 5756. Eligible officers are then recommended for promotion by the selection boards, based upon merit, and are placed on a promotion list and promoted in due course as vacancies occur in the higher ranks. \u00a7 5769. Because the number of lieutenant commanders is set by statute, the number of lieutenants, like Ballard, who may be recommended for promotion and placed on a promotion list in any year depends upon the number of vacancies existing and estimated for the coming year in the rank of lieutenant commander. \u00a7 5756.\n\n\n5\nWholly separate promotion lines are established for the various categories of officers. Thus, in addition to the selection boards that are convened to review the promotion of male line officers, different selection boards are convened to recommend for promotion staff corps officers (except for women officers appointed under \u00a7 5590), \u00a7 5702, male officers in the Marine Corps, \u00a7 5703, and women line officers, \u00a7 5704(a), and women staff officers who are appointed under \u00a7 5590. \u00a7 5704(b). The convening of these separate selection boards permits naval officers within each category to be considered for promotion in comparison with other officers with similar opportunities and experience.\n\n\n6\nBecause the Navy has a pyramidal organizational structure, fewer officers are needed at each higher rank than are needed in the rank below. In the absence of some mandatory attrition of naval officers, the result would be stagnation of promotion of younger officers and disincentive to naval service. If the officers who failed to be promoted remained in the service, the promotion of younger officers through the ranks would be retarded. Accordingly, a basic 'up or out' philosophy was developed to maintain effective leadership by heightening competition for the higher ranks while providing junior officers with incentive and opportunity for promotion. It is for this reason, and not merely because of administrative or fiscal policy considerations, that \u00a7 6382(a) requires that lieutenants be discharged when they are 'considered as having failed of selection for promotion to the grade of lieutenant commander . .. for the second time.'5 Similar selection-out rules apply to officers in different ranks who are twice passed over for promotion.6\n\n\n7\nThe phrase 'failed of selection for promotion' in \u00a7 6382(a) is a statutory term of art. It does not embrace all eligible officers who have been considered and not selected for promotion. Before an officer is considered to have failed of selection for the first time, he must have been placed within a 'promotion zone' established by the Secretary of the Navy. The Secretary each year establishes 'promotion zones' of officers who will either be selected for promotion to the next higher grade or who will be considered to have failed of selection for promotion for the first time. See \u00a7\u00a7 5764, 5776. The number of officers in the zones, established for each grade, is set at a level to ensure a flow of promotions consistent with the appropriate terms of service in each grade, see \u00a7 5768, and to provide opportunity for promotion of others in succeeding years. The number of officers within each zone is thus based on 'a consideration of the number of vacancies estimated for the next higher grade in each of the next five years, the number of officers who will be eligible for selection in each of those years, and the terms of service that those officers will have completed.' \u00a7 5764(a).\n\n\n8\nSection 6401 is the mandatory-attrition provision that applies to women officers appointed under \u00a7 5590, including all women line officers and most women officers in the Staff Corps.7 It provides for mandatory discharge of a woman officer appointed under \u00a7 5590 when she 'is not on a promotion list'8 and 'has completed 13 years of active commissioned service in the Navy.' \u00a7 6401. Section 6401 was initially intended approximately to equate the length of service of women officers before mandatory discharge for want of promotion with that of male lieutenants discharged under \u00a7 6382(a).9 Subsequently, however, Congress specifically recognized that the provisions of \u00a7 6401 would probably result in longer tenure for women lieutenants than for male lieutenants under \u00a7 6382. When it enacted legislation eliminating many of the former restrictions on women officers' participation in the naval service in 1967,10 Congress expressly left undisturbed the 13-year tenure provision of \u00a7 6401. And both the House and the Senate Reports observed that the attrition provisions governing women line officers would parallel 'present provisions with respect to male officers except that the discharge of male officers probably occurs about 2 years earlier.' S.Rep.No. 676, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 12; U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1967, p. 1850; H.R.Rep.No.216, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 17 (emphasis added).11\n\nII\n\n9\nIt is against this background that we must decide whether, agreeably to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Congress may accord to women naval officers a 13-year tenure of commissioned service under \u00a7 6401 before mandatory discharge for want of promotion, while requiring under \u00a7 6382(a) the mandatory discharge of male lieutenants who have been twice passed over for promotion but who, like Ballard, may have had less than 13 years of commissioned service. In arguing that Congress has acted unconstitutionally, appellee relies primarily upon the Court's recent decisions in Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 36 L.Ed.2d 583, and Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 92 S.Ct. 251, 30 L.Ed.2d 225.\n\n\n10\nIn Frontiero the Court was concerned with 'the right of a female member of the uniformed services to claim her spouse as a 'dependent' for the purposes of obtaining increased quarters allowances and medical and dental benefits under 37 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401, 403, and 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1072, 1076, on an equal footing with male members.' 411 U.S., at 678, 93 S.Ct., at 1766. Under the governing statutes, a serviceman could automatically claim his spouse as a 'dependent,' but a servicewoman's male spouse was not considered to be a 'dependent' unless he was shown in fact to be dependent upon his wife for more than one-half of his support. The challenged classification was based exclusively on gender, and the Government conceded that the different treatment of men and women service members was based solely upon considerations of administrative convenience. The Court found this disparity of treatment constitutionally invalid. In the words of the plurality opinion:\n\n\n11\n'(A)ny statutory scheme which draws a sharp line between the      sexes, solely for the purpose of achieving administrative      convenience, necessarily commands 'dissimilar treatment for      men and women who are . . . similarly situated,' and      therefore involves the 'very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the (Constitution) . . ..' Reed v. Reed,      404 U.S., at 77, 76, 92 S.Ct. at 254. We therefore conclude      that, by according differential treatment to male and female      members of the uniformed services for the sole purpose of      achieving administrative convenience, the challenged statutes      violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment insofar      as they require a female member to prove the dependency of      her husband.' Id., at 690\u2014691, 93 S.Ct., at 1772.\n\n\n12\nThe case of Reed v. Reed, supra, involved quite similar considerations. In that case the Court considered the constitutionality of an Idaho probate code provision that, in establishing who would administer a decedent's estate, gave a 'mandatory' preference to men over women when they were in the same degree of relationship to the decedent. The Idaho law permitted no consideration of the individual qualifications of particular men or women as potential administrators, but simply preferred males in order to reduce probate expenses by eliminating contests over the relative qualifications of men and women otherwise similarly situated. The Court held that '(b)y providing dissimilar treatment for men and women who are thus similarly situated, the challenged section violates the Equal Protection Clause.' 404 U.S., at 77, 92 S.Ct., at 254.\n\n\n13\nIn both Reed and Frontiero the challenged classifications based on sex were premised on overbroad generalizations that could not be tolerated under the Constitution. In Reed, the assumption underlying the Idaho statute was that men would generally be better estate administrators than women. In Frontiero, the assumption underlying the Federal Armed Services benefit statutes was that female spouses of servicemen would normally be dependent upon their husbands, while male spouses of servicewomen would not.\n\n\n14\nIn contrast, the different treatment of men and women naval officers under \u00a7\u00a7 6382 and 6401 reflects, not archaic and overbroad generalizations, but, instead, the demonstrable fact that male and female line officers in the Navy are not similarly situated with respect to opportunities for professional service. Appellee has not challenged the current restrictions on women officers' participation in combat and in most sea duty. Specifically 'women may not be assigned to duty in aircraft that are engaged in combat missions nor may they be assigned to duty on vessels of the Navy other than hospital ships and transports.' 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6015. Thus, in competing for promotion, female lieutenants will not generally have compiled records of seagoing service comparable to those of male lieutenants. In enacting and retaining \u00a7 6401, Congress may thus quite rationally have believed that women line officers had less opportunity for promotion than did their male counterparts, and that a longer period of tenure for women officers would, therefore, be consistent with the goal to provide women officers with 'fair and equitable career advancement programs.' H.R.Rep. No. 216, supra, at 5. Cf. Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U.S. 351, 94 S.Ct. 1734, 40 L.Ed.2d 189.12\n\n\n15\nThe complete rationality of this legislative classification is underscored by the fact that in corps where male and female lieutenants are similarly situated, Congress has not differentiated between them with respect to tenure. Thus women staff officers not appointed under \u00a7 5590 are subject to the same mandatory attrition rule of \u00a7 6382(a) as are male officers. These include officers in the Medical, Dental, Judge Advocate General's, and Medical Service Corps. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5574, 5578, 5578a, 5579. Conversely, active male lieutenants who are members of the Nurse Corps, like female lieutenants in that Corps, are within the ambit of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6396(c), which contains a 13-year tenure provision like \u00a7 6401.\n\n\n16\nIn both Reed and Frontiero the reason asserted to justify the challenged gender-based classifications was administrative convenience, and that alone. Here, on the contrary, the operation of the statutes in question results in a flow of promotions commensurate with the Navy's current needs and serves to motivate qualified commissioned officers to so conduct themselves that they may realistically look forward to higher levels of command. This Court has recognized that 'it is the primary business of armies and navies to fight or be ready to fight wars should the occasion arise.' U.S. ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U.S. 11, 17, 76 S.Ct. 1, 5, 100 L.Ed. 8. See also Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U.S. 83, 94, 73 S.Ct. 534, 540, 97 L.Ed. 842. The responsibility for determining how best our Armed Forces shall attend to that business rests with Congress, see U.S.Const., Art. I, \u00a7 8, cls. 12\u201414, and with the President. See U.S.Const., Art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 1. We cannot say that, in exercising its broad constitutional power here, Congress has violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.13\n\n\n17\nThe judgment is reversed.\n\n\n18\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting.\n\n\n19\nThe Court concludes that the statutory scheme which results in different periods of tenure for male and female line lieutenants of the Navy does not contravene the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because 'Congress may . . . quite rationally have believed that women line officers has less opportunity for promotion than did their male counterparts, and that a longer period of tenure for women officers would, therefore, be consistent with the goal to provide women officers with 'fair and equitable career advancement programs.\" Ante, at 508. I believe, however, that a legislative classification that is premised solely upon gender must be subjected to close judicial scrutiny. Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 36 L.Ed.2d 583 (1973), Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U.S. 351, 94 S.Ct. 1734, 40 L.Ed.2d 189 (1974) (Brennan, J., dissenting). Such suspect classifications can be sustained only if the Government demonstrates that the classification serves compelling interests that cannot be otherwise achieved. Here, the Government as much as concedes that the gender-based distinctions in separation provisions for Navy officers fulfill no compelling purpose.\n\n\n20\nFurther, the Court goes far to conjure up a legislative purpose which may have underlain the gender-based distinction here attacked. I find nothing in the statutory scheme or the legislative history to support the supposition that Congress intended, by assuring women but not men line lieutenants in the Navy a 13-year tenure, to compensate women for other forms of disadvantage visited upon them by the Navy.1 Thus, the genderbased classification of which appellee complains is not related, rationally or otherwise, to any legitimate legislative purpose fairly to be inferred from the statutory scheme or its history, and cannot be sustained.\n\n\n21\n* As the Court recounts, \u00a7 6401 was enacted as part of the Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948, 62 Stat. 368. This Act, while providing for the first time a permanent role for women in the military, severely limited their career opportunities. Among other things, it provided that women in the Navy could not be permanently promoted above the rank of commander, and it set the number of women lieutenants, lieutenant commanders, and commanders at a small percentage of the number of regular women officers on active duty. Perhaps because these limitations upon promotion opportunities made it impractical to guarantee women line officers promotion at any uniform rate, the promotion zone system provided for men by the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 860, was not applied to them. And, as explained by the Court, without a promotion zone system, the basis for determining involuntary separation under \u00a7 6382(a), whether an officer has twice 'failed of selection for promotion,' has no meaning.2 Therefore, the separation provisions for women line officers, given the rest of the statutory provisions applicable to them, had to be pegged to time served rather than to opportunities for promotion. The number of years selected for women line lieutenants, 13, corresponded exactly to the normal number of years Congress intended to precede separation for a male officer not chosen for promotion. See ante, at 504\u2014505 n. 9.3 Thus, Congress' original purpose in enacting slightly different separation provisions for men and women is quite certain\u2014to create the same tenure in years for women lieutenants as for the average male lieutenant before involuntary separation was permitted.\n\n\n22\nHowever, for reasons not entirely clear upon the record in this case, the promotion zone system for men did not, as administered by the Navy, result in the normal 13-year tenure for men before involuntary separation contemplated by \u00a7\u00a7 5764 and 5768.4 Rather, in 1967 the normal tenure for men seems to have been about 11 years, see H.R.Rep.no. 216, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 17; S.Rep.No.676, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 12; and in 1972, when respondent was due for discharge, it was eight or nine years. Brief for Appellants 16.\n\n\n23\nIn 1967, Congress decided to eliminate many of the provisions restricting career opportunities for women. In doing so it wishes, as the Court notes, to provide women with 'fair and equitable career advancement programs.' H.R.Rep.No.216, supra, at 5. However, contrary to the Court's assumption, Congress determined to achieve this goal, not by providing special compensatory treatment for women, but by removing most of the restrictions upon them and then subjecting them to the same provisions generally governing men. Id., at 3; S.Rep.No.676, supra, at 2, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1967, p. 1839.\n\n\n24\nFirst, the entire structure of the 1967 Act is directed toward assimilating as much as possible the promotion structure for women line officers to that of men. The Act, for example, provided for a promotion zone system for women line officers in the Navy, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 5764(d), and applied the 'failure of selection' designation to women by amending 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 5776.5 These additions make the retention of 13-year tenure for women line lieutenants somewhat anomalous, since the 'failure of selection' designation appears to have no function except as an aid to determining involuntary separation. Thus, as the hesitant language the Court uses in describing Congress' possible compensatory purpose recognizes, it is impossible to divine from the structure of the Act itself a reason for retaining the 13-year tenure for women but not for men.\n\n\n25\nSecond, the legislative history of the 1967 Act makes quite clear that Congress' purpose in retaining the 13-year tenure for women line lieutenants was not to take account of the limited opportunities available to women in the Navy. Congress explicitly recognized that in some instances involuntary retirement and separation provisions 'permit women to remain on active duty for longer periods than male officers.' It believed that '(u)nder current circumstances, there is no logical basis for these differences.' S.Rep.No.676, supra, at 2, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1967, p. 1840. (Emphasis supplied.) See H.R.Rep.No. 216, supra, at 2\u20143; Hearing on H.R. 4772, 4903, 5894, before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 41 (1967). The 1967 Act was to 'apply the standard attrition provisions of male officers promotion and retirement laws to women officers. The only exception to this would be the selective continuation of nurses.' H.R.Rep.No. 216, supra, at 3.6 (Emphasis supplied.) See S.Rep.No.676, supra, at 2. In light of these statements, Congress could not have had the purpose of compensating women line officers for their inferior position in the Navy by retaining longer tenure periods for women.\n\n\n26\nMoreover, the legislative history is replete with indications of a decision not to give women any special advantage. 'The purpose of the legislation has been limited to the removal of arbitrary restrictions. No effort has been made to provide special assurances to women officers, and none is recommended.' Letter from General Counsel, Department of Defense, in S.Rep.No.676, supra, at 5, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1967, p. 1842; H.R.Rep.No.216, supra, at 9. 'The purpose of the bill is to create parity only in respect to recognizing merit and performance.' Id., at 7. See S.Rep.No.676, supra, at 3.7 (Emphasis supplied.) To infer a determination purposely to perpetuate a longer retention period for women line officers is, therefore, eitirely to misconceive Congress' perception of the problem and of the proper solution. While the reason for the failure to revise \u00a7\u00a7 6382 and 6401 is not clear, it is certainly plausible to conclude that Congress continued to believe, as it had in 1948, that the separation provisions for men and women would, given the opportunity to work properly, result in equal average tenure for both sexes.8\n\nII\n\n27\nGiven this analysis of the relationship between \u00a7 6382 and \u00a7 6401, the difference in tenure which resulted in fact from the operation of these sections manifestly serves no overriding or compelling governmental interest. Indeed, the appellants concede as much in discussing proposed H.R. 12405 (93d Cong., 2d Sess.), \u00a7\u00a7 2(5) and 4(18), to which the Court refers, ante, at 510, n. 13: 'The Department of Defense considers that the separate rule for women, while serving a legitimate governmental purpose . . . is on balance no longer needed as a matter of military personnel policy.' Brief for Appellants 18. (Emphasis supplied.) Since the executive department most intimately concerned with the promotion policy in the Navy can perceive no need for the gender-based classification under attack, the interest served by the classification, if any, can hardly be overriding or compelling.9\n\n\n28\nFurther, while I believe that 'providing special benefits for a needy segment of society long the victim of purposeful discrimination and neglect' can serve 'the compelling . . . interest of achieving equality for such groups,' Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U.S. at 358\u2014359, 94 S.Ct., at 1739 (Brennan, J., dissenting), I could not sustain this statutory scheme even if I accepted the Court's supposition that such a purpose lay behind this classification. Contrary to the Court's intimation, ante, at 508, women do not compete directly with men for promotion in the Navy. Rather, selection boards for women are separately convened, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 5704, the number of women officers to be selected for promotion is separately determined, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 5760, promotion zones for women are separately designated, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 5764, and women's fitness for promotion is judged as compared to other women, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 5707. In this situation, it is hard to see how women are disadvantaged in their opportunity for promotion by the fact that their duties in the Navy are limited, or how increasing their tenure before separation for nonpromotion is necessary to compensate for other disadvantages.\n\nIII\n\n29\nThe Court suggests no purpose other than compensation for disadvantages of women which might justify this gender-based classification. I agree that the 'up or out' philosophy 'was developed to maintain effective leadership by heightening competition for the higher ranks while providing junior officers with incentive and opportunity for promotion.' Ante, at 502\u2014503. But the purpose behind the 'up or out' philosophy applies as well to women as to men. The issue here is not whether the treatment accorded either women or men under the statutory scheme would, if applied evenhandedly to both sexes, forward a legitimate or compelling state interest, but whether the differences in the provisions applicable to men and women can be justified by a governmental purpose.10\n\n\n30\nFor this same reason, the invocation of the deference due Congress in determining how best to assure the readiness of our Armed Forces for battle cannot settle the issue before us. As Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 36 L.Ed.2d 583 (1973), illustrates, the fact that an equal protection claim arises from statutes concerning military personnel policy does not itself mandate deference to the congressional determination, at least if the sex-based classification is not itself relevant to and justified by the military purposes.\n\n\n31\nThus, the validity of the statutory scheme must stand or fall upon the Court's asserted compensatory goal. Yet, as the analysis in Part I, supra, demonstrates, this purpose was not in fact behind either the original enactment of \u00a7 6401 or its retention in 1967. While we have in the past exercised our imaginations to conceive of possible rational justifications for statutory classifications, see McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 425\u2014428, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 1104\u20141106, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961), we have recently declined to manufacture justifications in order to save an apparently invalid statutory classification. Cf. James v. Strange, 407 U.S. 128, 92 S.Ct. 2027, 32 L.Ed.2d 600 (1972); Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U.S. 164, 92 S.Ct. 1400, 31 L.Ed.2d 768 (1972). Moreover, we have analyzed asserted governmental interests to determine whether they were in fact the legislative purpose of a statutory classification, Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 442 443, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 1032\u20141033, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972), and have limited our inquiry to the legislature's stated purposes when these purposes are clearly set out in the statute or its legislative history. Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361, 376, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 1170, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974). Never, to my knowledge, have we endeavored to sustain a statute upon a supposition about the legislature's purpose in enacting it when the asserted justification can be shown conclusively not to have underlain the classification in any way.11\n\n\n32\nSince the Government here has advanced no governmental interest fairly to be gleaned from \u00a7\u00a7 6382 and 6401 or their history which can justify this gender-based classification, I would affirm the judgment below.\n\n\n33\nMr. Justice WHITE, dissenting.\n\n\n34\nAgreeing for the most part with Mr. Justice BRENNAN's dissenting opinion, I also dissent from the judgment of the Court.\n\n\n\n1\n Title 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6382 provides:\n'(a) Each officer on the active list of the Navy serving in the grade of lieutenant, except an officer in the Nurse Corps, and each officer on the active list of the Marine Corps serving in the grade of captain shall be honorably discharged on June 30 of the fiscal year in which he is considered as having failed of selection for promotion to the grade of lieutenant commander or major for the second time. However, if he so requests, he may be honorably discharged at any time during that fiscal year.\n'(d) This section does not apply to women officers appointed under section 5590 of this title or to officers designated for limited duty.'\nBallard's scheduled discharge carried with it an entitlement to a 'lump-sum' severance payment of approximately $15,000, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6382(c), but would have terminated Ballard's total service time (including seven years of enlisted service) short of the 20 years of service necessary for substantially greater retirement benefits.\n\n\n2\n Title 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6401(a) provides:\n'Each woman officer on the active list of the Navy, appointed under section 5590 of this title, who holds a permanent appointment in the grade of lieutenant and each woman officer on the active list of the Marine Corps who holds a permanent appointment in the grade of captain shall be honorably discharged on June 30 of the fiscal year in which\u2014\n'(1) she is not on a promotion list; and\n'(2) she has completed 13 years of active commissioned service in the Navy or in the Marine Corps.\n'However, if she so requests, she may be honorably discharged at any time during that fiscal year.'\n\n\n3\n The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides in pertinent part that no person shall 'be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.' Although it contains no Equal Protection Clause as does the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause prohibits the Federal Government from engaging in discrimination that is 'so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process.' Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499, 74 S.Ct. 693, 694, 98 L.Ed. 884. See also Schneider v. Rusk, 377 U.S. 163, 168, 84 S.Ct. 1187, 1190, 12 L.Ed.2d 218.\n\n\n4\n Similarly, the authorized strength of the Supply Corps and the Civil Engineers Corps is established in set proportions to the authorized number of line officers. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 5404(a). More complicated formulas set the bounds for the number of staff officers in other corps. E.g., \u00a7 5404(b).\n\n\n5\n See S.Rep. No. 2120, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., 4. Parts of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 that affected naval officers were codified in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 5401 et seq., by the Act of Aug. 10, 1956, 70A Stat. 297. Title 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6382(a) is a codification of \u00a7 312(h) of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 860, and that section was based, in turn, on \u00a7 12(c) of the Act of June 23, 1938, 52 Stat. 949.\n\n\n6\n Title 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 6382(b) calls for the mandatory discharge of lieutenants (junior grade) who twice fail to be selected for promotion to the grade of lieutenant. In the grades above lieutenant, statutory provisions require the mandatory retirement, instead of discharge, of officers twice passed over for promotion. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6376, 6379, 6380.\n\n\n7\n Section 6401 does not apply to women officers, appointed pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5574, 5578, 5578a, and 5579, who are in the Medical, Dental, Judge Advocate General's, and Medical Service Corps. These women staff officers are, like male officers, subject to \u00a7 6382(a).\n\n\n8\n The reason for the 'not on a promotion list' language of \u00a7 6401, as contrasted with the 'failed of selection' language of \u00a7 6382(a), is in part historical. Section 6401 was enacted as \u00a7 207(j) of the Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948, 62 Stat. 368. The 'promotion zone' system was not established for women appointed under \u00a7 5590 until 1967. Pub.L. 90\u2014130, 81 Stat. 374 (1967). See \u00a7 5764(d).\n\n\n9\n See Hearings on S. 1527 before the Senate Committee on Armed Services (subsequently S. 1641), 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 39. Although the statutory eligibility periods for promotion through the ranks to lieutenant commander is somewhat shorter, \u00a7 5751(b), the normal time in service as an ensign, lieutenant (junior grade), and lieutenant is 12 years under peacetime conditions. \u00a7 5768(a). Accordingly, a male line officer who had achieved the rank of lieutenant would typically have completed 12 years of service before being considered for the rank of lieutenant commander, and would have completed 13 years of service before being passed over twice for promotion to the grade of lieutenant commander.\n\n\n10\n See Pub.L. 90\u2014130, 81 Stat. 374 (1967). This Act repealed numerical and percentage restrictions on women officers in certain grades, removed restrictions on permanent appointment of women officers to the rank of captain, and authorized women officers under certain circumstances to be eligible for flag rank. Congress also established a 'promotion zone' system for women officers and indicated that the promotion and attrition of female officers were generally to correspond to the treatment of male officers. S.Rep.No. 676, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 2, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1967, p. 1839.\n\n\n11\n According to the brief of the Solicitor General, the tenure differential has since been increased by the removal of time-in-grade restrictions and accelerated promotions resulting from the Vietnam conflict. See Exec. Order No. 11437, Dec. 2, 1968, 3 CFR 754 (1966\u20141970 Comp.). Thus in recent years the discharge of male officers under \u00a7 6382(a) may have occurred about four years earlier than the discharge of women officers under \u00a7 6401, instead of the two years' difference acknowledged by Congress in 1967.\n\n\n12\n The dissenting opinion argues that, in retaining \u00a7 6401 in 1967, Congress may not have intended to give a longer tenure to women line officers than to their male counterparts, because 'it is certainly plausible to conclude that Congress continued to believe, as it had in 1948, that the separation provisions for men and women would, given the opportunity to work properly, result in equal average tenure for both sexes.' Post, at 517. This conclusion cannot, however, be reconciled with Congress' recognition that mandatory retirement provisions for women line officers 'parallel present provisions with respect to male officers except that the discharge of male officers probably occurs about 2 years earlier.' S.Rep.No. 676, supra, at 12, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1967, p. 1850; H.R.Rep.No.216, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 17 (emphasis added). Alternatively, the dissent seems to imply that the 'anomalous' retention in 1967 of the 13-year tenure provision of \u00a7 6401 may have resulted from congressional inadvertence. Post, at 514\u2014515. But this\nview cannot be squared with the legislative history either. A major factor prompting the 1967 amendments was Congress' express concern that unless restrictions on promotions of women naval officers were lifted, the operation of \u00a7 6401 would cause excessive forced retirement of women lieutenants. In discussing the problem, the House Report explicitly described the 13-year provision:\n'A particularly severe problem of promotion stagnation exists among WAVE officers in the Navy. The present grade limitations on promotion of WAVE officers to the grades of commander-lieutenant commander have so reduced the vacancies that the Navy will be forced to discharge most regular WAVE lieutenants when they reach their 13th year of service if relief is not provided.\n'Present law (sec. 6401, title 10, United States Code) provides that women officers on the active list of the Navy in the grade of lieutenant must be discharged on June 30 of the fiscal year in which they complete 13 years of active commissioned service if not on a promotion list that year. The Navy estimates that without legislative relief, the attrition among women line lieutenants will average 50 percent or more over the next 5 years. The Navy considers such heavy at trition unacceptable.' H.R.Rep.No.216, supra, at 6.\nIt is thus clear that Congress in 1967 intentionally retained the 13-year tenure provision of \u00a7 6401, and did so with specific knowledge that it gave women line officers a longer tenure than their male counterparts.\n\n\n13\n We observe that because of the restrictions that were removed from women officers' participation in naval service in 1967, see Act of Nov. 8, 1967, 81 Stat. 374; S.Rep.No. 676, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1967, p. 1839, more opportunity has become available for women officers. We are told by the Solicitor General that since 1967, the Secretary of the Navy has implemented a program for acceleration of women officers' promotion and that today women are being considered for promotion within the same time periods as are men. Apparently believing that the need for a tenure differential has subsided, the Department of Defense has submitted a bill to Congress that would substitute for \u00a7 6401 the same rule that governs made lieutenants. See \u00a7\u00a7 2(5) and 4(18)(L) of H.R. 12405 (93d Cong., 2d Sess.), which contains a new provision as a proposed replacement of both \u00a7 6382 and 6401. These developments no more than reinforce the view that it is for Congress, and not for the courts, to decide when the policy goals sought to be served by \u00a7 6401 are no longer necessary to the Navy's officer promotion and attrition programs.\n\n\n1\n Indeed, I find quite troublesome the notion that a gender-based difference in treatment can be justified by another, broader, gender-based difference in treatment imposed directly and currently by the Navy itself. While it is true that the restrictions upon women officers' opportunities for professional service are not here directly under attack, they are obviously implicated on the Court's chosen ground for decision, and the Court ought at least to consider whether they may be valid before sustaining a provision it coceives to be based upon them.\n\n\n2\n Also, even if it were possible to devise some alternative way of deciding when a woman officer had 'failed of selection for promotion,' the limitation upon promotion opportunities for women meant that retention until two failures of selection could have been indefinite retention. In 1967, in fact, the statutory grade limitations upon promotions for women had produced such limited vacancies in the upper ranks that, but for the fact that some of the limitations were removed by the 1967 Act, promotions of lieutenants in the WAVES would have had to be suspended altogether for four or five years. H.R.Rep.No. 216, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 6 (1967). See Hearings on H.R. 5894 before Subcommittee No. 1 of the House Committee on Armed Services, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 384 (1967). If involuntary separation had been keyed to failure of selection, no WAVE line lieutenants could have been separated during those five years.\n\n\n3\n Section 5768 sets out the normal times of service for male officers in the line of the Navy. Section 5764, the section establishing the promotion zone system, specifies that the number of officers in the promotion zone each year shall be chosen 'in order to maintain a flow of promotion consistent with the terms of service set out in section 5768 . . . and in order best to assure to individuals in succeeding years equality of opportunity for promotion.' Thus, the 'normal terms of service,' \u00a7 5768, were to be achieved through the administrative determination of promotion zones each year.\n\n\n4\n The explanation seemingly lies in the provisions permitting suspension of these sections. Section 48 of the Act of Aug. 10, 1956, provided that:\n'(a) Except as they may apply to women officers of the Regular Navy . . . appointed under section 5590 of title 10, . . . the following sections of title 10 cease to operate whenever the number of male officers serving on active duty in the grade of ensign or above in the line of the Navy does not exceed the number of male officers holding permanent appointments in the grade of ensign or above on the active list in the line of the Regular Navy: Sections . . . 5764\u20145770 . . ..' 70A Stat. 639.\nAlso, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 5785 provides that:\n'(b) During a war or national emergency, the President may suspend any provision of the proceding sections of this chapter relating to officers of the Navy . . ., other than women officers appointed under section 5590 of this title.'\nBecause these sections do not apply to women covered by \u00a7 6401, any suspensions could have the effect of shortening normal tenure for men without affecting the tenure of women. See ante, at 505 n. 11.\n\n\n5\n Other examples of the degree to which women officers were subjected to the same promotion and retention system as men are:\n(1) The amendment of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 5771 so that women officers on a promotion list, like men, can be promoted as soon as vacancies occur. This was done to prevent a delay of six to eight months in promotion which caused 'women officers to fall behind their male contemporaries.' H.R.Rep.No. 216, supra, at 15; S.Rep.No.676, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., at 10, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1967, p. 1839.\n(2) The amendment of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5704, 5711, and related sections so that all women line officers on active duty, including Reserve officers, will, like all men line officers on active duty, be considered for promotion by the same selection boards and in the same way.\nAside from \u00a7 6401, some distinctions between the promotion systems for male and female line officers did survive the 1967 Act. See, e.g., 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 5707 (difference between men and women on standard for selection below lieutenant commander). It is significant, however, that as a result of the 1967 amendments, the tenure in years for unrestricted men and women line officers is the same for all grades in which involuntary separation or retirement is linked for both to years served. Compare 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6376 and 6379 with \u00a7 6398; \u00a7 6380 with \u00a7 6400. However, in most instances men cannot be involuntarily retired until they have twice failed of selection and reached the required tenure in years, while for women failure to be promoted within the requisite number of years is sufficient.\n\n\n6\n Congressman Rivers, Chairman of the House Committee on Armed Services, stated flatly during floor debate on H.R. 5894 that the bill assured that women 'have the same tenure as male officers of the same grade.' 113 Cong.Rec. 11303 (May 1, 1967). (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n7\n Senator Thurmond, floor manager of the bill, made much the same point during hearings on the bill. He said: '(T)he purpose of this bill is not to provide special promotional opportunities for women or to give them any advantage, but it is to place them on a parity with or give them equal opportunities . . ..' Hearing on H.R. 4772, 4903, 5894, before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 46 (1967).\n\n\n8\n In addition, there are indications in the hearings on the bill that the reason for not changing \u00a7\u00a7 6382 and 6401 was that the promotional systems for all services were then under review, and that the Armed Services therefore did not want to change in the interim provisions believed basically to apply equitably to both sexes. See Hearings on H.R. 5894, before Subcommittee No. 1 of the House Committee on Armed Services, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 383 (1967) (remarks of Assistant Secretary Morris); Hearings, Senate Committee on Armed Services, supra, at 44 (remarks of General Berg).\n\n\n9\n The Court comments that the submission of H.R. 12405 'no more than reinforce(s) the view that it is for Congress, and not for the courts, to decide when the policy goals sought to be served by \u00a7 6401 are no longer necessary to the Navy's officer promotion and attrition programs.' Ante, at 510 n. 13. But the Court does not, and could not, show that the gender-based classification underlying \u00a7 6401 was ever necessary to the Navy's program; it only ventures that Congress 'may . . . rationally,' ante, at 508 (emphasis supplied), have believed the policy to be wise or fair. Further, the close scrutiny which I believe gender-based classifications require necessitates that courts evaluate both the strength of the asserted interest and the need for the means chosen toward that end. Implicit in this task is that the courts do not necessarily accept the legislature's decisions about the need for certain legislation when gender-based distinctions are involved.\n\n\n10\n In neither Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 92 S.Ct. 251, 30 L.Ed.2d 225 (1971), nor Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 36 L.Ed.2d 583 (1973), was it doubted that the statutes in question forwarded legitimate governmental goals, absent the classifications by sex. In Reed, the Court expressly noted that 'the objective of reducing the workload on probate courts by eliminating one class of contests is not without some legitimacy,' 404 U.S., at 76, 92 S.Ct., at 254, and it noted that the statutory scheme set up non sex-based classifications toward the same end, which it seemingly approved. Id., at 77, 92 S.Ct., at 254. Similarly, in Frontiero, the inquiry focused upon the 'difference in treatment,' 411 U.S., at 679, 93 S.Ct., at 1766, accorded women and men in determining eligibility for dependents' benefits, not upon the strength of the Government's interest in according dependents' benefits to members of the Armed Services. Thus, I fail to see how the strength of the governmental interest in the 'up or out' system can distinguish Reed or Frontiero. See also James v. Strange, 407 U.S. 128, 141, 92 S.Ct. 2027, 2034, 32 L.Ed.2d 600 (1972); Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U.S. 164, 173, 92 S.Ct. 1400, 1405, 31 L.Ed.2d 768 (1972).\n\n\n11\n Indeed, to do so is to undermine the very premises of deference to legislative determination. If a legislature, considering the competing factors, determines that it is wise policy to treat two groups of people differently in pursuit of a certain goal, courts often defer to that legislative determination. But when a legislature has decided not to pursue a certain goal, upholding a statute on the basis of that goal is not properly deference to a legislative decision at all; it is deference to a decision which the legislature could have made but did not.

The District Court concluded that the statute was violative of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Supremacy Clause, and granted injunctive relief. Held:\n1. Section 53 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment since, in the context of New York's statutory civil service scheme, it sweeps indiscriminately and is not narrowly limited to the accomplishment of substantial state interests. Pp. 638\u2014643.\n2. The 'special public interest' doctrine has no applicability in this case. Pp. 643\u2014645.\n3. Nor can the citizenship requirement be justified on the unproved premise that aliens are less permanent employees than citizens, or on other grounds asserted by appellants. Pp. 645\u2014646.\n4. While the State has an interest in defining its political community, and in corresponding interest in establishing the qualifications for persons holding state elective or important nonelective executive, legislative, and judicial positions, the broad citizenship requirement established by \u00a7 53 cannot be justified on this basis. Pp. 646\u2014649.\n339 F.Supp. 906, affirmed.\nSamuel A. Hirshowitz, New York City, for appellants.\nLester Evens, New York City, for appellees.\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nSection 53(1) of the New York Civil Service Law reads:\n\n\n2\n'Except as herein otherwise provided, no person shall be      eligible for appointment for any position in the competitive      class unless he is a citizen of the United States.'1\n\n\n3\nThe four appellees, Patrick McL. Dougall, Esperanza Jorge, Teresa Vargas, and Sylvia Castro, are federally registered resident aliens. When, because of their alienage, they were discharged in 1971 from their competitive civil service positions with the city of New York, the appellees instituted this class action challenging the constitutionality of \u00a7 53. The named defendants, and appellants here, were the Administrator of the city's Human Resources Administration (HRA), and the city's Director of Personnel and Chairman of its Civil Service Commission. The appellees sought (1) a declaration that the statute was invalid under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, (2) injunctive relief against any refusal, on the ground of alienage, to appoint and employ the appellees, and all persons similarly situated, in civil service positions in the competitive class, and (3) damages for lost earnings. A defense motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction was denied by Judge Tenney, 330 F.Supp. 265 (SDNY 1971). A three-judge court was convened. That court ruled that the statute was violative of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Supremacy Clause, and granted injunctive relief. 339 F.Supp. 906 (SDNY 1971).2 Judge Lumbard joined the court's opinion and judgment, but wrote separately in concurrence. Id., at 911. Probable jurisdiction was noted. 407 U.S. 908, 92 S.Ct. 2434, 32 L.Ed.2d 682 (1972).\n\n\n4\n* Prior to December 28, 1970, the appellees were employed by nonprofit organizations that received funds through HRA from the United States Office of Economic Opportunity. These supportive funds ceased to be available about that time and the organizations, with approximately 450 employees, including the appellees and 16 other noncitizens, were absorbed by the Manpower Career and Development Agency (MCDA) of HRA.3 The appellant Administrator advised the transferees that they would be employed by the city.4 The appellees in fact were so employed in MCDA. In February, however, they were informed that they were ineligible for employment by the city and that they would be dismissed under the statutory mandate of \u00a7 53(1). Shortly thereafter, they were discharged from MCDA solely because of their alienage.5\n\n\n5\nAppellee Dougall was born in Georgetown, Guyana, in September 1927. He has been a resident of New York City since 1964. He was employed by MCDA as an administrative assistant in the staff Development Unit.\n\n\n6\nAppellee Jorge was born in November 1948 in the Dominican Republic. She has been a resident of New York City since 1967. She was employed by the Puerto Rican Forum as a clerk-typist and, later, as a human resources technician. She worked in the latter capacity for MCDA.\n\n\n7\nAppellee Vargas was born in the Dominican Republic in June 1946. She has been a resident of New York City since 1963. She worked as a clerk-typist for the Puerto Rican Forum and in the same capacity for MCDA.\n\n\n8\nAppellee Castro was born in El Salvador in June 1944. She has resided in New York City since 1967. She was employed by the Puerto Rican Forum as an assistant counselor and then as a human resources technician and worked in the latter capacity for MCDA.\n\n\n9\nThe record does not disclose that any of the four appellees ever took any step to attain United States citizenship.\n\n\n10\nThe District Court, in reaching its conclusion that \u00a7 53 was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, placed primary reliance on this Court's decisions in Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971), and Takahashi v. Fish Comm'n, 334 U.S. 410, 68 S.Ct. 1138, 92 L.Ed. 1478 (1948), and, to an extent, on Purdy & Fitzpatrick v. State, 71 Cal.2d 566, 79 Cal.Rptr. 77, 456 P.2d 645 (1969). On the basis of these cases, the court also concluded that \u00a7 53 was in conflict with Congress' comprehensive regulation of immigration and naturalization because, in effect, it denied appellees entrance to, and abode in, New York. Accordingly, the court held, \u00a7 53 encroached upon an exclusive federal power and was constitutionally impermissible under Art. VI, cl. 2, of the Constitution.\n\nII\n\n11\nAs is so often the case, it is important at the outset to define the precise and narrow issue that is here presented. The Court is faced only with the question whether New York's flat statutory prohibition against the employment of aliens in the competitive classified civil service is constitutionally valid. The Court is not asked to decide whether a particular alien, any more than a particular citizen, may be refused employment or discharged on an individual basis for whatever legitimate reason the State might possess.\n\n\n12\nNeither is the Court reviewing a legislative scheme that bars some or all aliens from closely defined and limited classes of public employment on a uniform and consistent basis. The New York scheme, instead, is indiscriminate. The general standard is enunciated in the State's Constitution, Art. V, \u00a7 6, and is to the effect that appointments and promotions in the civil service 'shall be made according to merit and fitness to be ascertained, as far as practicable, by examination which, as far as practicable, shall be competitive.' In line with this rather flexible constitutional measure, the classified service is divided by statute into four classes. New York Civil Service Law \u00a7 40. The first is the exempt class. It includes, generally, the higher offices in the state executive departments, certain municipal officers, certain judicial employees, and positions for which a competitive or noncompetitive examination may be found to be impracticable. The exempt class contains no citizenship restriction whatsoever. \u00a7 41. The second is the noncompetitive class. This includes positions, not otherwise classified, for which a noncompetitive examination would be practicable. There is no citizenship requirement. \u00a7 42. The third is the labor class. This includes unskilled laborers holding positions for which competitive examinations would be impracticable. No alienage exclusion is imposed. \u00a7 43. The fourth is the competitive class with which we are here concerned. This includes all positions for which it is practicable to determine merit and fitness by a competitive examination. s 44. Only citizens of the United States may hold positions in this class. \u00a7 53. The limits of these several classes, particularly the competitive class from which the appellees were deemed to be disqualified, are not readily defined. It would appear, however, that, consistent with the broad scope of the cited constitutional provision, the competitive class reaches various positions in nearly the full range of work tasks, that is, all the way from the menial to the policy making.\n\n\n13\nApart from the classified civil service, New York has an unclassified service. \u00a7 35. This includes, among others, all elective offices, offices filled by legislative appointment, employees of the legislature, various offices filled by the Governor, and teachers. No citizenship requirement is present there.\n\n\n14\nOther constitutional and statutory citizenship requirements round out the New York scheme. The constitution of the State provides that voters, Art. II, \u00a7 1, members of the legislature, Art. III, \u00a7 7, the Governor and Lieutenant-Governor, Art. IV, \u00a7 2, and the Comptroller and Attorney-General, Art. V, \u00a7 1, are to be United States citizens. And Public Officers Law \u00a7 3 requires that any person holding 'a civil office' be a citizen of the United States. A 'civil office' is apparently one that 'possesses any of the attributes of a public officer or . . . involve(s) some portion of the soverign (sic) power.' 1967 Op.N.Y.Atty.Gen. 60; New York Post Corp. v. Moses, 12 A.D.2d 243, 250, 210 N.Y.S.2d 88, 95, rev'd on other grounds, 10 N.Y.2d 199, 219 N.Y.S.2d 7, 176 N.E.2d 709 (1961).\n\n\n15\nWe thus have constitutional provisions and a number of statutes that, together, constitute New York's scheme for the exclusion of aliens from public employment. The present case concerns only \u00a7 53 of the Civil Service Law. The section's constitutionality, however, is to be judged in the context of the State's broad statutory framework and the justifications the State presents.\n\nIII\n\n16\nIt is established, of course, that an alien is entitled to the shelter of the Equal Protection Clause. Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 371, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 1851, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971); Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 39, 36 S.Ct. 7, 9, 60 L.Ed. 131 (1915); Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U.S. 228, 238, 16 S.Ct. 977, 981, 41 L.Ed. 140 (1896); Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 369, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 1070, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886). See In re Griffiths, 413 U.S. 717, 93 S.Ct. 2851, 37 L.Ed.2d 910. This protection extends, specifically, in the words of Mr. Justice Hughes, to aliens who 'work for a living in the common occupations of the community.' Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S., at 41, 36 S.Ct., at 10.\n\n\n17\nA. Appellants argue, however, that \u00a7 53 does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment because the statute 'establishes a generic classification reflecting the special requirements of public employment in the career civil service.'6 The distinction drawn between the citizen and the alien, it is said, 'rests on the fundamental concept of identity between a government and the members, or citizens, of the state.'7 The civil servant 'participates directly in the formulation and execution of government policy,' and thus must be free of competing obligations to another power.8 The State's interest in having an employee of undivided loyalty is substantial, for obligations attendant upon foreign citizenship 'might impair the exercise of his judgment or jeopardize public confidence in his objectivity.'9 Emphasis is placed on our decision in United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 67 S.Ct. 556, 91 L.Ed. 754 (1947), upholding the Hatch Act and its proscription of political activity by certain public employees, and it is said that the public employer 'has broad discretion to establish qualifications for its employees related to the integrity and efficiency of the operations of government.'10\n\n\n18\nIt is at once apparent, however, that appellants' asserted justification proves both too much and too little. As the above outline of the New York scheme reveals, the State's broad prohibition of the employment of aliens applies to many positions with respect to which the State's proffered justification has little, if any, relationship. At the same time, the prohibition has no application at all to positions that would seem naturally to fall within the State's asserted purpose. Our standard of review of statutes that treat aliens differently from citizens requires a greater degree of precision.\n\n\n19\nIn Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S., at 372, 91 S.Ct., at 1852, we observed that aliens as a class 'are a prima example of a 'discrete and insular' minority (see United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152\u2014153, n. 4, 58 S.Ct. 778, 783\u2014784, 82 L.Ed. 1234 (1938)),' and that classifications based on alienage are 'subject to close judicial scrutiny.' And as long as a quarter century ago we held that the State's power 'to apply its laws exclusively to its alien inhabitants as a class is confined within narrow limits.' Takahashi v. Fish Comm'n, 334 U.S., at 420, 68 S.Ct., at 1143. We therefore look to the substantiality of the State's interest in enforcing the statute in question, and to the narrowness of the limits within which the discrimination is confined.\n\n\n20\nApplying this standard to New York's purpose in confining civil servants in the competitive class to those persons who have no ties of citizenship elsewhere, \u00a7 53 does not withstand the necessary close scrutiny. We recognize a State's interest in establishing its own form of government, and in limiting participation in that government to those who are within 'the basic conception of a political community.' Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 344, 92 S.Ct. 995, 1004, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972). We recognize, too, the State's broad power to define its political community. But in seeking to achieve this substantial purpose, with discrimination against aliens, the means the State employs must be precisely drawn in light of the acknowledged purpose.\n\n\n21\nSection 53 is neither narrowly confined nor precise in its application. Its imposed ineligibility may apply to the 'sanitation man, class B,' Perotta v. Gregory, 4 Misc.2d 769, 158 N.Y.S.2d 221 (1957), to the typist, and to the office worker, as well as to the person who directly participates in the formulation and execution of important state policy. The citizenship restriction sweeps indiscriminately. Viewing the entire constitutional and statutory framework in the light of the State's asserted interest, the great breadth of the requirement is even more evident. Sections 35 and 41 of the Civil Service Law, relating generally to persons holding elective and high appointive offices, contain no citizenship restrictions. Indeed, even \u00a7 53 permits an alien to hold a classified civil service position under certain circumstances. In view of the breadth and imprecision of \u00a7 53 in the context of the State's interest, we conclude that the statute does not withstand close judicial scrutiny.\n\n\n22\nB. Appellants further contend, however, that the State's legitimate interest is greater than simply limiting to citizens those high public offices that have to do with the formulation and exeuction of state policy. Understandably relying on this Court's decisions in Crane v. New York, 239 U.S. 195, 36 S.Ct. 85, 60 L.Ed. 218 (1915), Heim v. McCall, 239 U.S. 175, 36 S.Ct. 78, 60 L.Ed. 206 (1915), and Ohio ex rel. Clarke v. Deckebach, 274 U.S. 392, 47 S.Ct. 630, 71 L.Ed. 1115 (1927), appellants argue that a State constitutionally may confine public employment to citizens. Mr. Justice (then Judge) Cardozo accepted this 'special public interest' argument because of the State's concern with 'the restriction of the resources of the state to the advancement and profit of the members of the state.' People v. Crane, 214 N.Y. 154, 161, 108 N.E. 427, 429 aff'd, 239 U.S. 195, 36 S.Ct. 85, 60 L.Ed. 218 (1915). We rejected that approach, however, in the context of public assistance in Graham, where it was observed that 'the special public interest doctrine was heavily grounded on the notion that '(w)hatever is a privilege, rather than a right, may be made dependent upon citizenship.' People v. Crane . . .. But this Court now has rejected the concept that constitutional rights turn upon whether a governmental benefit is characterized as a 'right' or as a 'privilege.\" 403 U.S., at 374, 91 S.Ct., at 1853. See also Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 404, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 1794, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963); Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 627 n. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 1327, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969); Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 262, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 1017, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970); Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 539, 91 S.Ct. 1586, 1589, 29 L.Ed.2d 90 (1971).\n\n\n23\nAppellants argue that our rejection of the special-public-interest doctrine in a public assistance case does not require its rejection here. That the doctrine has particular applicability with regard to public employment is demonstrated, according to appellants, by the decisions in Crane and Heim that upheld, under Fourteenth Amendment challenge, those provisions of the New York Labor Law that confined employment on public works to citizens of the United States.11 See M. Konvitz, The Alien and the Asiatic in American Law, c. 6 (1946).\n\n\n24\nWe perceive no basis for holding the special-public-interest doctrine inapplicable in Graham and yet applicable and controlling here. A resident alien may reside lawfully in New York for a long period of time. He must pay taxes. And he is subject to service in this country's Armed Forces. 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 454(a). See Astrup v. Immigration Service, 402 U.S. 509, 91 S.Ct. 1583, 29 L.Ed.2d 68 (1971). The doctrine, rooted as it is in the concepts of privilege and of the desirability of confining the use of public resources, has no applicability in this case. To the extent that Crane, Heim, and Clarke intimate otherwise, they were weakened by the decisions in Takahashi and Graham, and are not to be considered as controlling here.\n\n\n25\nC. The State would tender other justifications for \u00a7 53's bar to employment of aliens in the competitive civil service. It is said that career civil service is intended for the long-term employee, and that the alien, who is subject to deportation and, as well, to conscription by his own country, is likely to remain only temporarily in a civil service position. We fully agree with the District Court's response to this contention:\n\n\n26\n'There is no offer of proof on this issue and (appellants)      would be hard pressed to demonstrate that a permanent      resident alien who has resided in New York or the surrounding      area for a number of years, as have (appellees), and whose      family also resides here, would be a poorer risk for a career      position in New York . . . than an American citizen who,      prior to his employment with the City or State, had been      residing in another state.' 339 F.Supp., at 909.\n\n\n27\nAppellants further assert that employment of aliens in the career civil service would be inefficient, for when aliens eventually leave their positions, the State will have the expense of hiring and training replacements. Even if we could accept the premise underlying this argument\u2014that aliens are more likely to leave their work than citizens\u2014and assuming that this rationale could be logically confined to the classified competitive civil service, the State's suggestion does not withstand examination. As we stated in Graham, noting the general identity of an alien's obligations with those of a citizen, the \"justification of limiting expenses is particularly inappropriate and unreasonable when the discriminated class consists of aliens.\" 403 U.S., at 376, 91 S.Ct. at 1854.\n\n\n28\nWe hold that \u00a7 53, which denies all aliens the right to hold positions in New York's classified competitive civil service, violates the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guarantee.12\n\n\n29\nBecause of this conclusion, we need not reach the issue whether the citizenship restriction is in conflict with Congress' comprehensive regulation of immigration and naturalization. See Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S., at 376\u2014380, 91 S.Ct. at 1854\u20141856.\n\nIV\n\n30\nWhile we rule that \u00a7 53 is unconstitutional, we do not hold that, on the basis of an individualized determination, an alien may not be refused, or discharged from, public employment, even on the basis of noncitizenship, if the refusal to hire, or the discharge, rests on legitimate state interests that relate to qualifications for a particular position or to the characteristics of the employee. We hold only that a flat ban on the employment of aliens in positions that have little, if any relation to a State's legitimate interest, cannot withstand scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n31\nNeither do we hold that a State may not, in an appropriately defined class of positions, require citizenship as a qualification for office. Just as 'the Framers of the Constitution intended the States to keep for themselves, as provided in the Tenth Amendment, the power to regulate elections,' Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 124\u2014125, 91 S.Ct. 260, 263, 27 L.Ed.2d 272 (1970) (footnote omitted) (opinion of Black, J.); see id., at 201, 91 S.Ct. at 303 (opinion of Harlan, J.), and id., at 293\u2014294, 91 S.Ct. at 348\u2014349 (opinion of Stewart, J.), '(e)ach State has the power to prescribe the qualifications of its officers and the manner in which they shall be chosen.' Boyd v. Thayer, 143 U.S. 135, 161, 12 S.Ct. 375, 382, 36 L.Ed. 103 (1892). See Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 41, 12 L.Ed. 581 (1849); Pope v. Williams, 193 U.S. 621, 632\u2014633, 24 S.Ct. 573, 575, 48 L.Ed. 817 (1904). Such power inheres in the State by virtue of its obligation, already noted above, 'to preserve the basic conception of a political community.' Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S., at 344, 92 S.Ct., at 1004. And this power and responsibility of the State applies, not only to the qualifications of voters, but also to persons holding state elective or important nonelective executive, legislative, and judicial positions, for officers who participate directly in the formulation, execution, or review of broad public policy perform functions that go to the heart of representative government. There, as Judge Lumbard phrased it in his separate concurrence, is 'where citizenship bears some rational relationship to the special demands of the particular position.' 339 F.Supp., at 911.\n\n\n32\nWe have held, of course, that such state action, particularly with respect to voter qualifications is not wholly immune from scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. See, for example, Kramer v. Union School District, 395 U.S. 621, 89 S.Ct. 1886, 23 L.Ed.2d 583 (1969). But our scrutiny will not be so demanding where we deal with matters resting firmly within a State's constitutional prerogatives. Id., at 625, 89 S.Ct., at 1888; Carrington v. Rash, 380 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 775, 777, 13 L.Ed.2d 675 (1965). This is no more than a recognition of a State's historical power to exclude aliens from participation in its democratic political institutions, Pope v. Williams, 193 U.S., at 632\u2014634, 24 S.Ct., at 575\u2014576; Boyd v. Thayer, 143 U.S., at 161, 12 S.Ct., at 381, and a recognition of a State's constitutional responsibility for the establishment and operation of its own government, as well as the qualifications of an appropriately designated class of public office holders.13 U.S.Const. Art. IV, \u00a7 4; U.S.Const. Amdt. X; Luther v. Borden, supra; see In re Duncan, 139 U.S. 449, 461, 11 S.Ct. 573, 577, 35 L.Ed. 219 (1891). This Court has never held that aliens have a constitutional right to vote or to hold high public office under the Equal Protection Clause. Indeed, implicit in many of this Court's voting rights decisions is the notion that citizenship is a permissible criterion for limiting such rights. Kramer v. Union School District, 395 U.S., at 625, 89 S.Ct., at 1888; Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 567, 568, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1384, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964); Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 666 667, 86 S.Ct. 1079, 1081, 16 L.Ed.2d 169 (1966); Carrington v. Rash, 380 U.S., at 91, 93\u201494, 96, 85 S.Ct., at 777\u2014779; Lassiter v. Northampton Election Board, 360 U.S. 45, 50\u201451, 79 S.Ct. 985, 989, 3 L.Ed.2d 1072 (1959); Mason v. Missouri, 179 U.S. 328, 335, 21 S.Ct. 125, 128, 45 L.Ed. 214 (1900). A restriction on the employment of noncitizens, narrowly confined, could have particular relevance to this important state responsibility, for alienage itself is a factor that reasonably could be employed in defining 'political community.'\n\n\n33\nThe judgment of the District Court is affirmed.\n\n\n34\nAffirmed.\n\n\n35\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting.\n\n\n36\nThe Court in these two cases holds that an alien is not really different from a citizen, and that any legislative classification on the basis of alienage is 'inherently suspect'. The Fourteenth Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause of which the Court interprets as invalidating the state legislation here involved, contains no language concerning 'inherently suspect classifications,' or, for that matter, merely 'suspect classifications.' The principal purpose of those who drafted and adopted the Amendment was to prohibit the States from invidiously discriminating by reason of race, Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 21 L.Ed. 394 (1873), and, because of this plainly manifested intent, classifications based on race have rightly been held 'suspect' under the Amendment. But there is no language used in the Amendment, nor any historical evidence as to the intent of the Framers, which would suggest to the slightest degree that it was intended to render alienage a 'suspect' classification, that it was designed in any way to protect 'discrete and insular minorities' other than racial minorities, or that it would in any way justify the result reached by the Court in these two cases.\n\n\n37\nTwo factual considerations deserve more emphasis than accorded by the Court's opinions. First, the records in Nos. 71 1222 and 71\u20141336 contain no indication that the aliens suffered any disability that precluded them, either as a group or individually, from applying for and being granted the status of naturalized citizens. The appellees in No. 71\u20141222, as far as the record discloses, took no steps to obtain citizenship or indicate any affirmative desire to become citizens. In No. 71\u20141336, appellant was eligible for naturalization but 'elected to remain a citizen of the Netherlands', 162 Conn. 249, 250, 294 A.2d 281, 282, and deliberately chose not to file a declaration of intent under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1427(f), 1430(a). The 'status' of these individuals was not, therefore, one with which they were forever encumbered; they could take steps to alter it when and if they chose.1\n\n\n38\nSecond, the appellees in No. 71\u20141222 all sought to be employees of administrative agencies of the New York City government. Of the 20 members of the class represented by the named appellees, three were typists, one a 'senior clerk,' two 'human resources technicians,' three 'senior human resources technicians,' six 'human resource specialists,' three 'senior human resources specialists,' and two 'supervising human resource specialists.' The record does not reveal what functions are performed by these civil servants, although appellee Dougall apparently was the chief administrator of a program; the remaining appellees were all employees of the New York City Human Resources Administration, the governmental body with numerous employees which administers many types of social welfare programs, spending a great deal of money and dealing constantly with the public and other arms of the federal, state, and local governments.\n\n\n39\n* The Court, by holding in these cases and in Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971), that a citizen-alien classification is 'suspect' in the eyes of our Constitution, fails to mention, let alone rationalize, the fact that the Constitution itself recognizes a basic difference between citizens and aliens. That distinction is constitutionally important in no less than 11 instances in a political document noted for its brevity. Representatives, U.S.Const. Art. I, \u00a7 2, cl. 2, and Senators, Art. I, \u00a7 3, cl. 3, must be citizens. Congress has the authority '(t)o establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization' by which aliens can become citizen members of our society, Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 4; the judicial authority of the federal courts extends to suits involving citizens of the United States 'and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects,' Art. III, \u00a7 2, cl. 1, because somehow the parties are 'different,' a distinction further made by the Eleventh Amendment; the Fifteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-Fourth, and Twenty-Sixth Amendments are relevant only to 'citizens.' The President must not only be a citizen but 'a natural born Citizen,' Art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 5. One might speculate what meaning Art. IV, \u00a7 2, cl. 1, has today.\n\n\n40\nNot only do the numerous classifications on the basis of citizenship that are set forth in the Constitution cut against both the analysis used and the results reached by the Court in these cases; the very Amendment which the Court reads to prohibit classifications based on citizenship establishes the very distinction which the Court now condemns as 'suspect.' The first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment provides:\n\n\n41\n'All persons born or naturalized in the United States and      subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the      United States and of the State wherein they reside.'\n\n\n42\nIn constitutionally defining who is a citizen of the United States, Congress obviously thought it was doing something, and something important. Citizenship meant something, a status in and relationship with a society which is continuing and more basic than mere presence or residence. The language of that Amendment carefully distinguishes between 'persons' who, whether by birth or naturalization, had achieved a certain status, and 'persons' in general. That a 'citizen' was considered by Congress to be a rationally distinct subclass of all 'persons' is obvious from the language of the Amendment.\n\n\n43\nIt is unnecessary to venture into a detailed discussion of what Congress intended by the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The paramount reason was to amend the Constitution so as to overrule explicitly the Dred Scott decision. Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393, 15 L.Ed. 691 (1857). Our decisions construing 'the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States' are not irrelevant to the question now before the Court, insofar as they recognize that there are attributes peculiar to the status of federal citizenship. See, e.g., Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall., at 79; United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 23 L.Ed. 588 (1876); Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651, 4 S.Ct. 152, 28 L.Ed. 274 (1884); Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 U.S. 47, 11 S.Ct. 851, 35 L.Ed. 649 (1891); Logan v. United States, 144 U.S. 263, 12 S.Ct. 617, 36 L.Ed. 429 (1892); In re Quarles, 158 U.S. 532, 15 S.Ct. 959, 39 L.Ed. 1080 (1895). Cf. Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, 18 L.Ed. 744 (1868). Decisions of this Court holding that an alien is a 'person' within the meaning of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment are simply irrelevant to the question of whether that Amendment prohibits legislative classifications based upon this particular status. Since that Amendment by its own terms first defined those who had the status as a lesser included class of all 'persons,' the Court's failure to articulate why such classifications under the same Amendment are now forbidden serves only to illuminate the absence of any constitutional foundation for these instant decisions.\n\n\n44\nThis Court has held time and again that legislative classifications on the basis of citizenship were subject to the rational-basis test of equal protection, and that the justifications then advanced for the legislation were rational. See Ohio ex rel. Clarke v. Deckebach, 274 U.S. 392, 47 S.Ct. 630, 71 L.Ed. 1115 (1927); Terrace v. Thompson, 263 U.S. 197, 44 S.Ct. 15, 68 L.Ed. 255 (1923); Porterfield v. Webb, 263 U.S. 225, 44 S.Ct. 21, 68 L.Ed. 278 (1923); Webb v. O'Brien, 263 U.S. 313, 44 S.Ct. 112, 68 L.Ed. 318 (1923); Frick v. Webb, 263 U.S. 326, 44 S.Ct. 115, 68 L.Ed. 323 (1923); Patsone v. Pennsylvania, 232 U.S. 138, 34 S.Ct. 281, 58 L.Ed. 539 (1914); Blythe v. Hinckley, 180 U.S. 333, 21 S.Ct. 390, 45 L.Ed. 557 (1901); Hauenstein v. Lynham, 100 U.S. 483, 25 L.Ed. 628 (1880).\n\n\n45\nThis Court explicitly held that it was not a violation of the Equal Protection Clause for a State by statute to limit employment on public projects to citizens. Heim v. McCall, 239 U.S. 175, 36 S.Ct. 78, 60 L.Ed. 206 (1915); Crane v. New York, 239 U.S. 195, 36 S.Ct. 85, 60 L.Ed. 218 (1915). Even if the Court now considers that the justifications for those enactments are 'NOT CONTROLLING,' THOSE DECISIONS CLEARLy hold that the rational-basis test applies.\n\n\n46\nTo reject the methodological approach of these decisions, the Court now relies in part on the decisions in Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 36 S.Ct. 7, 60 L.Ed. 131 (1915), and Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm'n, 334 U.S. 410, 68 S.Ct. 1138, 92 L.Ed. 1478 (1948). In Truax, supra, the Court invalidated a state statute which prohibited employers of more than five persons from employing more than 20% noncitizens. The law was applicable to all businesses. In holding that the law was invalid under the Equal Protection Clause, the Court took pains to explain that the decision was not meant to disturb prior holdings, 239 U.S., at 39, 36 S.Ct., at 9, and specifically noted that 'it should be added that the act is not limited to persons who are engaged on public work or receive the benefit of public moneys.' Id., at 40, 36 S.Ct., at 10. Indeed, Heim and Crane were decided after Truax, as was Clarke, which held that a State could constitutionally prohibit aliens from engaging in certain types of businesses. If anything, Truax was limited by these later decisions.\n\n\n47\nTakahashi, supra, involved a statute which prohibited aliens 'ineligible for citizenship' under federal law from receiving commercial fishing licenses. A State whose classification on the basis of race would have been legitimately 'suspect' under the Fourteenth Amendment was in effect using Congress' power to classify in granting or withholding citizenship. The Court did not countenance this attempt at discrimination on the basis of race 'by incorporation.' Two features of that law should be noted. First, the statutory classification was not one involving citizens and aliens; it classified citizens and those resident aliens eligible for citizenship into one group, and resident aliens ineligible for citizenship into another. No reason for discriminating among resident aliens is apparent. Second, and most important, is the fact that, although the Court properly refused to inquire into the legislative motive, the overwhelming effect of the law was to bar resident aliens of Japanese ancestry from procuring fishing licenses. The Court was not blind to this fact, or to history. See 334 U.S., at 412, n. 1, 413, 68 S.Ct., at 1139. The state statute that classifies aliens on the basis of country of origin is much more likely to classify on the basis of race, and thus conflict with the core purpose of the Equal Protection Clause, than a statute that, as here, merely distinguishes between alienage as such and citizenship as such. Takahashi did not, however, overrule previous decisions, and certainly announced no 'suspect classification' rule with regard to citizen-alien classifications. To say that it did evades rather than confronts precedent.\n\n\n48\nThe third, and apparently paramount, 'decision' upon which the Court relied in Graham, and which is merely quoted in the instant decisions, is a footnote from United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 58 S.Ct. 778, 82 L.Ed. 1234 (1938), a case involving a federal statute prohibiting the interstate shipment of filled milk. That footnote discussed the presumption of constitutionality of statutes and stated:\n\n\n49\n'Nor need we enquire whether similar considerations enter      into the review of statutes directed at particular religious,      Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69      L.Ed. 1070, or national, Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 43      S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042; Bartels v. Iowa, 262 U.S. 404, 43      S.Ct. 628, 67 L.Ed. 1047; Farrington v. Tokushige, 273 U.S.      284, 47 S.Ct. 406, 71 L.Ed. 646, or racial minorities, Nixon      v. Herndon (273 U.S. 536, 47 S.Ct. 446, 71 L.Ed. 759); Nixon      v. Condon (286 U.S. 73, 52 S.Ct. 484, 76 L.Ed. 984): whether      prejudice against discrete and insular minorities may be a      special condition, which tends seriously to curtail the      operation of those political processes ordinarily to be      relied upon to protect minorities, and which may call for a correspondingly more searching judicial inquiry.' Id., at 152      153, n. 4, 58 S.Ct., at 784.\n\n\n50\nOn the 'authority' of this footnote, which only four Members of the Court in Carolene Products joined, the Court in Graham merely stated that 'classifications based on alienage . . . are inherently suspect' because '(a) liens as a class are a prime example of a 'discrete and insular' minority . . . for whom such heightened judicial solicitude is appropriate.' 403 U.S., at 372, 91 S.Ct., at 1852.\n\n\n51\nAs Mr. Justice Frankfurter so aptly observed:\n\n\n52\n'A footnote hardly seems to be an appropriate way of      announcing a new constitutional doctrine, and the Carolene      footnote did not purport to announce any new doctrine . . ..'      Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77, 90\u201491, 69 S.Ct. 448, 455, 93      L.Ed. 513 (1949) (concurring opinion).\n\n\n53\nEven if that judicial approach were accepted, however, the Court is conspicuously silent as to why that 'doctrine' should apply to these cases.\n\n\n54\nThe footnote itself did not refer to 'searching judicial inquiry' when a classification is based on alienage, perhaps because there was a long line of authority holding such classifications entirely consonant with the Fourteenth Amendment. The 'national' category mentioned involved legislative attempts to prohibit education in languages other than English, which attempts were held unconstitutional as a deprivation of 'liberty' within the meaning of the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments. These cases do not mention a 'citizen-alien' distinction, nor do they support a reasoning that 'nationality' is the same as 'alienage.'\n\n\n55\nThe mere recitation of the words 'insular and discrete minority' is hardly a constitutional reason for prohibiting state legislative classifications such as are involved here, and is not necessarily consistent with the theory propounded is that footnote. The approach taken in Graham and these cases appears to be that whenever the Court feels that a societal group is 'discrete and insular,' it has the constitutional mandate to prohibit legislation that somehow treats the group differently from some other group.\n\n\n56\nOur society, consisting of over 200 million individuals of multitudinous origins, customs, tongues, beliefs, and cultures is, to say the least, diverse. It would hardly take extraordinary ingenuity for a lawyer to find 'insular and discrete' minorities at every turn in the road. Yet, unless the Court can precisely define and constitutionally justify both the terms and analysis it uses, these decisions today stand for the proposition that the Court can choose a 'minority' it 'feels' deserves 'solicitude' and thereafter prohibit the States from classifying that 'minority' differently from the 'majority.' I cannot find, and the Court does not cite, any constitutional authority for such a 'ward of the Court' approach to equal protection.\n\n\n57\nThe only other apparent rationale for the invocation of the 'suspect classification' approach in these cases is that alienage is a 'status,' and the Court does not feel it 'appropriate' to classify on that basis. This rationale would appear to be similar to that utilized in Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U.S. 164, 92 S.Ct. 1400, 31 L.Ed.2d 768 (1972), in which the Court cited, without discussion, Graham. Id., at 176 n. 14, 92 S.Ct., at 1407. But there is a marked difference between a status or condition such as illegitimacy, national origin, or race, which cannot be altered by an individual and the 'status' of the appellant in No. 71\u20141336 or of the appellees in No. 71-1222. There is nothing in the record indicating that their status as aliens cannot be changed by their affirmative acts.\n\nII\n\n58\nIn my view, the proper judicial inquiry is whether any rational justification exists for prohibiting aliens from employment in the competitive civil service and from admission to a state bar.\n\n\n59\n'State legislatures are presumed to have acted within their      constitutional power despite the fact that, in practice,      their laws result in some inequality. A statutory      discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts      reasonably may be conceived to justify it.' McGowan v.      Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 425\u2014426, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 1104\u20141105, 6      L.Ed.2d 393 (1961).\n\n\n60\nBefore discussing this question, a preliminary reflection on the Court's opinions is warranted. Perhaps the portions of the opinions that would most disturb native-born citizens and especially naturalized citizens who have worked diligently to learn about our history, mores, and political institutions and who have successfully completed the rigorous process of naturalization, is the intimation, if not statement, that they are really not any different from aliens. The Court concludes that, because aliens residing in our country must pay taxes and some of them (but not appellant in No. 71\u20141336) might at one time have been subject to service in the Armed Forces, the two 'groups' are indistinguishable for purposes of equal protection analysis. Compulsory military service has been ended by Congress.2 Given the ubiquity of texes in our present society, it is, in my opinion, totally unconvincing to attribute to their payment the leveling significance indicated by the Court. Is an alien who, after arriving from abroad in New York City, immediately purchases a pack of cigarettes, thereby paying federal, state, and city taxes, really no different from a citizen?\n\n\n61\nThe opinion of the Court in No. 71-1222 would appear to answer this question in the negative, but it then proceeds to state that there is a difference between aliens and citizens for purposes of participation and service in the political arenas. Unless the Court means that citizenship only has meaning in a political context, the analytical approach of the Court is less than clear, hardly convincing, and curiously conflicts with the high nonpolitical value that the Court has heretofore ascribed to citizenship. If citizenship is not 'special,' the Court has wasted a great deal of effort in the past. Cf. Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253, 87 S.Ct. 1660, 18 L.Ed.2d 757 (1967); Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958).\n\n\n62\nThese statutes do not classify on the basis of country of origin; the distinctions are not between native Americans and 'foreigners,' but between citizens and aliens. The process of naturalization was specifically designed by Congress to require a foreign national to demonstrate that he or she is familiar with the history, traditions, and institutions of our society in a way that a native-born citizen would learn from formal education and basic social contact. Congress specifically provided that an alien seeking citizenship status must demonstrate 'an understanding of the English language' and 'a knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of the history, and of the principles and form of government, of the United States.' 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1423. The purpose was to make the alien establish that he or she understood, and could be integrated into, our social system.\n\n\n63\n'Through the system of citizenship classes sponsored by the      Immigration and Naturalization Service and the local school      system, the alien is aided in preparing himself for      citizenship, and every effort is made to give him fundamental      and uniform knowledge of our political and social structure.      In order that he may intelligently use this fundamental and      uniform knowledge and so that he may be a complete and      thoroughly integrated member of our American society, the      committee (House Judiciary Committee) feels that he should      have a basic knowledge of the common language of the country      and be able to read, write, and speak it with reasonable      facility.' H.R.Rep.No.1365, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 78 (1952)      (emphasis added).\n\n\n64\nSee also 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1424, which precludes aliens who manifest certain opposition to our society or form of government from being naturalized. An alien must demonstrate 'good moral character,' 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1427(a)(3), which was intended by Congress to mean a broad 'attach(ment) to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and (disposition) to the good order and happiness of the United States.' H.R.Rep.No.1365, supra, at 80. See also 8 CFR \u00a7 332b (1973), detailing the cooperation between the Immigration and Naturalization Service and local schools conducting citizenship education for applicants for naturalization. The above is sufficient to demonstrate, I believe, that Congress provided that aliens seeking citizenship status prove what citizens by birth are, as a class, presumed to understand: a basic familiarity with our social and political mores and institutions. The naturalized citizen has dem onstrated both the willingness and ability to integrate into our social system as a whole, not just into our 'political community,' as the Court apparently uses the term. He proved that he has become 'like' a native-born citizen in ways that aliens, as a class, could be presumed not to be. The Court simply ignores the purpose of the process of assimilation into and dedication to our society that Congress prescribed to make aliens 'like' citizens.\n\n\n65\nIn No. 71\u20141222, I do not believe that it is irrational for New York to require this class of civil servants to be citizens, either natural-born or naturalized. The proliferation of public administration that our society has witnessed in recent years, as a result of the regulation of conduct and the dispensation of services and funds, has vested a great deal of de facto decisionmaking or policymaking authority in the hands of employees who would not be considered the textbook equivalent of policymakers of the legislative or 'top' administrative variety. Nevertheless, as far as the private individual who must seek approval or services is concerned, many of these 'low level' civil servants are in fact policymakers. Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970), implicitly recognized that those who apply facts to individual cases are as much 'governors' as those who write the laws or regulations the 'low-level' administrator must 'apply.' Since policymaking for a political community is not necessarily the exclusive preserve of the legislators, judges, and 'top' administrators, it is not irrational for New York to provide that only citizens should be admitted to the competitive civil service.\n\n\n66\nBut the justification of efficient government is an even more convincing rationale. Native-born citizens can be expected to be familiar with the social and political institutions of our society; with the society and political mores that affect how we react and interact with other citizens. Naturalized citizens have also demonstrated their willingness to adjust to our patterns of living and attitudes, and have demonstrated a basic understanding of our institutions, system of government, history, and traditions. It is not irrational to assume that aliens as a class are not familiar with how we as individuals treat others and how we expect 'government' to treat us. An alien who grew up in a country in which political mores do not reject bribery or self-dealing to the same extent that our culture does; in which an imperious bureaucracy historically adopted a complacent or contemptuous attitude toward those it was supposed to serve; in which fewer if any checks existed on administrative abuses; in which 'low-level' civil servants serve at the will of their superiors\u2014could rationally be thought not to be able to deal with the public and with citizen civil servants with the same rapport that one familiar with our political and social mores would, or to approach his duties with the attitude that such positions exist for service, not personal sinecures of either the civil servant or his or her superior. These considerations could rationally be expected to influence how an administrator in charge of a program, such as appellee Dougall, made decisions in allocating funds, hiring or dealing with personnel, or decisionmaking, or how a lower level civil servant, such as appellee Jorge, was able to perform with and for fellow workers and superiors, even if she had no direct contact with the public. All these factors could materially affect the efficient functioning of the city government, and possibly as well the very integrity of that government. Such a legislative purpose is clearly not irrational.\n\n\n67\nIn No. 71\u20141336 the answer is not as clearcut. The States traditionally have had great latitude in prescribing rules and regulations concerning technical competence and character fitness, governing those who seek to be admitted to practice law. See, e.g., Konigsberg v. State Bar of California, 366 U.S. 36, 81 S.Ct. 997, 6 L.Ed.2d 105 (1961). The importance of lawyers and the judiciary in our system of government and justice needs no extended comment. An attorney is an 'officer of the court' in Connecticut, a status this Court has also recognized. See, e.g., Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 73, 53 S.Ct. 55, 65, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932); Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333, 370, 18 L.Ed. 366 (1867). He represents his client, but also, in Connecticut, may 'sign writs and subpoenas, take recognizances, (and) administer oaths.' Conn.Gen.Stat.Rev. \u00a7 51\u201485.\n\n\n68\nMore important than these emoluments of their position, though, is the tremendous responsibility and trust that our society places in the hands of lawyers. The liberty and property of the client may depend upon the competence and fidelity of the representation afforded by the lawyer in any number of particular lawsuits. But by virtue of their office lawyers are also given, and have increasingly undertaken to exercise, authority to seek to alter some of the social relationships and institutions of our society by use of the judicial process. No doubt an alien even under today's decision may be required to be learned in the law and familiar with the language spoken in the courts of the particular State involved. But Connecticut's requirement of citizenship reflects its judgment that something more than technical skills are needed to be a lawyer under our system. I do not believe it is irrational for a State that makes that judgment to require that lawyers have an understanding of the American political and social experience, whether gained from growing up in this country, as in the case of a native-born citizen, or from the naturalization process, as in the case of a foreign-born citizen. I suppose the Connecticut Bar Examining Committee could itself administer tests in American history, government, and sociology, but the State did not choose to go this route. Instead, it chose to operate on the assumption that citizens as a class might reasonably be thought to have a significantly greater degree of understanding of our experience than would aliens. Particularly in the case of one such as appellant, who candidly admits that she wants to live and work in the United States but does not want to sever her fundamental social and political relationship with the country of her birth, I do not believe the State's judgment is irrational.\n\n\n69\nI would therefore reverse the judgment in No. 71\u20141222 and affirm that in No. 71\u20141336.\n\n\n\n1\n The restriction has its statutory source in Laws of New York, 1939, c. 767, \u00a7 1. We are advised that the legislation was declarative of an administrative practice that had existed for many years. Tr. of Oral Arg. 43, 45.\nSection 53(2) of N.Y.Civ.Serv.Law (Supp.1972\u20141973) makes a temporary exception to the citizenship requirement:\n'2. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter or of any other law, whenever a department head or appointing authority deems that an acute shortage of employees exists in any particular class or classes of positions by reason of a lack of a sufficient number of qualified personnel available for recruitment, he may present evidence thereof to the state or municipal civil service commission having jurisdiction which, after due inquiry, may determine the existence of such shortage and waive the citizenship requirement for appointment to such class or classes of positions. The state commission or such municipal commission, as the case may be, shall annually review each such waiver of the citizenship requirement, and shall revoke any such waiver whenever it finds that a shortage no longer exists. A non-citizen appointed pursuant to the provisions of this section shall not be eligible for continued employment unless he diligently prosecutes the procedures for citizenship.'\nIt is to be observed that an appointment under this exception permits the alien to continue his employment only until, or annual review, it is deemed that 'a shortage no longer exists.' And, in any event, the alien 'shall not be eligible for continued employment unless he diligently prosecutes the procedures for citizenship.'\n\n\n2\n The court found jurisdiction in the Civil Rights Statutes, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) and (4). 339 F.Supp. 906, 907 n. 5. It held that the suit was properly maintainable as a class action and defined the class as consisting of 'all permanent resident aliens residing in New York State who, but for the enforcement of Section 53, would otherwise be eligible to compete for employment in the competitive class of Civil Service.'

Virginia, 94 U.S. 391, 24 L.Ed. 248 (1877), Patsone v. Pennsylvania, 232 U.S. 138, 34 S.Ct. 281, 58 L.Ed. 539 (1914); to inherit real property, Hauenstein v.

California, 332 U.S. 633, 68 S.Ct. 269, 92 L.Ed. 249 (1948).\n\n\n12\n We are aware that citizenship requirements are imposed in certain aspects of the federal service. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3301; Exec. Order No. 10577, 19 Fed.Reg. 7521, \u00a7 2.1 (1954); 5 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 338.101, 302.203(g) (1973); and, for example, Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriation Act, 1972, \u00a7 602, Pub.L. 92\u201449, 85 Stat. 122, and Public Works Appropriations Act, 1971, \u00a7 502, Pub.L. 91\u2014439, 84 Stat. 902. In deciding the present case, we intimate no view as to whether these federal citizenship requirements are or are not susceptible of constitutional challenge. See Jalil v. Hampton, 148 U.S.App.D.C. 415, 460 F.2d 923, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 887, 93 S.Ct. 112, 34 L.Ed.2d 144 (1972); Comment, Aliens and the Civil Service: A Closed Door?, 61 Geo.L.J. 207 (1972).\n\n\n13\n In congressional debates leading to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, there is clear evidence that Congress not only knew that as a matter of local practice aliens had not been granted the right to vote, but that under the amendment they did not receive a constitutional right of suffrage or a constitutional right to participate in the political process of state government, and that, indeed, the right to vote and the concomitant right of participation in the political process were matters of local law. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 141\u2014142, 2766\u20142767 (1866).\nIt is noteworthy, as well, that the 40th Congress considered and very nearly proposed a version of the Fifteenth Amendment that expressly would have prohibited discriminatory qualifications not only for voting but also for holding office. The provision was struck in conference. It is evident from the debate that, for whatever motive, its opponents wanted the States to retain control over the qualifications for office. Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 3d Sess., at 1425\u20141426, 1623\u20141633 (1869). And, of course, the Fifteenth Amendment applies by its terms only to 'citizens.'\n\n\n1\n Although some of the members of the class had not been residents of the United States for five years at the time the complaint was filed, and therefore were ineligible to apply immediately for citizenship, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1427, there is no indication that these members, assuming that they are in the same 'class' as the named appellees, would be prohibited from seeking citizenship status after they had resided in this country for the required period. In any event, this circumstance only underscores the fact that it is not unreasonable to assume that they have not learned about and adapted to our mores and institutions to the same extent as one who had lived here for five years would have through social contact.\n\n\n2\n Although stated in Graham and the instant cases that aliens are 'like' citizens because they were subject to service in the Armed Services, none of the opinions considered in fact that Congress provided that aliens who in fact served honorably could expeditiously become citizens. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1440. The Court's reliance on the fact that some male aliens had to register for the draft and serve if called to suggest that aliens and citizens are 'the same' neglects to consider this statute: aliens who served honorably were 'like' citizens in that they demonstrated, like citizens, a commitment to our society that Congress believed warranted, other considerations aside, their immediate, formal acceptance into our society.\n\n\n","label":1}

The District Court of Dodge County, Nebraska, dismissed petition, and juvenile appealed. The Nebraska Supreme Court, 183 Neb. 461, 161 N.W.2d 508, affirmed, and juvenile appealed. The United States Supreme Court held that where juvenile's counsel at juvenile court hearing did not object to preponderance-of-evidence standard and counsel admitted in oral argument before United States Supreme Court that no matter what standard was used evidence would be sufficient to support finding of delinquency, case was not appropriate one for consideration of whether preponderance-of-evidence standard in juvenile court proceedings required by Nebraska statute satisfied due process clause of Fourteenth Amendment.\nAppeal dismissed.\nMr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Douglas dissented.\nWilliam G. Line, Fremont, Neb., for appellant.\nRichard L. Kuhlman, Fremont, Neb., for appellee.\nAlfred L. Scanlan, Washington, D. C., for National Council of Juvenile Court Judges, as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nAfter a hearing before a juvenile court judge, appellant DeBacker was found to be a 'delinquent child'1 and ordered committeed to the Boys' Training School at Kearney, Nebraska2 DeBacker did not seek direct review of his commitment, but instead sought state habeas corpus. The Nebraska District Court dismissed appellant's petition, a divided Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed,3 and last Term we noted probable jurisdiction over the present appeal, 393 U.S. 1076, 89 S.Ct. 856, 21 L.Ed.2d 770. Because we find that resolution of the constitutional issues presented by appellant would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case, the appeal is dismissed. See Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, 331 U.S. 549, 67 S.Ct. 1409, 91 L.Ed. 1666.\n\n\n2\n1. Appellant asks this Court to decide whether the Fourteenth and Sixth Amendments, in light of this Court's decisions in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491; Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194, 88 S.Ct. 1477, 20 L.Ed.2d 522; and In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527, require a trial by jury in a state juvenile court proceeding based on an alleged act of the juvenile which, if committed by an adult, would, under the Duncan and Bloom cases, require a jury trial if requested. In DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U.S. 631, 88 S.Ct. 2093, 20 L.Ed.2d 1308, we held that Duncan and Bloom 'should receive only prospective application' and stated that we would 'not reverse state convictions for failure to grant jury trial where trials began prior to May 20, 1968, the date of this Court's decisions in Duncan v. Louisiana and Bloom v. Illinois.' 392 U.S., at 633, 635, 88 S.C., at 2095, 2096. Because appellant's juvenile court hearing was held on March 28, 1968\u2014prior to the date of the decisions in Duncan and Bloom\u2014appellant would have had no constitutional right to a trial by jury if he had been tried as an adult in a criminal proceeding. It thus seems manifest that this case is not an appropriate one for considering whether the Nebraska statute which provides that juvenile hearings be 'without a jury,' Neb. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 43-206.03(2), is constitutionally invalid in light of Duncan and Bloom.4\n\n\n3\n2. 2. Appellant next asks this Court to decide whether the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard for burden of proof in juvenile court proceedings, required by Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 43206.03(3), satisfies the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, at the appellant's juvenile court hearing, his counsel neither objected to the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, nor asked the judge to make a ruling based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In explaining why he did not seek a direct appeal from the juvenile court's determination that appellant had committed the act upon which rested the delinquent child finding, appellant's counsel stated at oral argument before this Court:\n\n\n4\n'[I]t has been pointed out that I did not attack the      sufficiency of the evidence.\n\n\n5\n'Of course, the reason for that is obvious. The evidence is      more than sufficient to sustain a conviction of what he did.      An appeal on the sufficiency of the evidence would have been      close to frivolous.' (Tr. 41-42.)\n\n\n6\nLater in oral argument counsel acknowledged that '[n]o matter what the standard was * * * [o]ur evidence just isn't insufficient.' (Tr. 47.) And when specifically asked whether '[t]he evidence was sufficient even under a reasonable doubt standard,' counsel responded: 'Even under a reasonable doubt standard * * *.' (Tr. 47.)\n\n\n7\nGiven this commendably forthright explanation by appellant's counsel, this case is not an appropriate vehicle for consideration of the standard of proof in juvenile proceedings.5\n\n\n8\n3. Appellant finally asks us to decide whether due process is denied because, as it is claimed, the Nebraska prosecutor had unreviewable discretion whether he would proceed against appellant in juvenile court rather than in ordinary criminal proceedings. The record shows (1) that appellant did not make this contention before the juvenile court judge; (2) that appellant raised the issue in his habeas corpus petition but that it was not passed on by the Nebraska District Court; (3) that appellant did not press the District Court's failure to consider this issue in his appeal to the Nebraska Supreme Court, and made only passing reference to the issue in his brief to that court; and (4) that the opinions of the Nebraska Supreme Court, 183 Neb. 461, 161 N.W.2d 508 did not pass on the issue, nor even refer to the contention. Given the barrenness of the record on this issue, in the exercise of our discretion, we decline to pass on it. So far as we have been made aware, this issue does not draw into question the validity of any Nebraska statute.6 Therefore, it could not, standing alone, be subject to review in this Court by way of an appeal. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257(2). '[I]nsofar as notation of probable jurisdiction may be regarded as a grant of the certiorari writ' as to this issue, we dismiss such writ as improvidently granted. Mishkin v. New York, 383 U.S. 502, 513, 86 S.Ct. 958, 966, 16 L.Ed.2d 56.\n\n\n9\nFor the foregoing reasons this appeal is dismissed.\n\n\n10\nDismissed.\n\n\n11\nMr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n\n\n12\nFor the reasons set forth herein and in the dissenting opinion of my Brother DOUGLAS, I dissent and would reverse the judgment below.\n\n\n13\nIn February 1968 appellant, who was then 17 years old, was charged under the laws of Nebraska with being a 'delinquent child'1 because he had a forged bank check which he intended to use for his own purposes.2 At the hearing on this charge he asked for a jury trial, arguing that this was a right guaranteed him by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution and that a statute prohibitng juries in 'delinquency' proceedings3 was therefore unconstitutional.\n\n\n14\nThis Court in In re Gault, 384 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967), held that juveniles charged with being 'delinquents' as a result of committing a criminal act were entitled to certain constitutional safeguards\u2014namely, notice of the issues involved, benefit of counsel, protection against compulsory self-incrimination, and confrontation of the witnesses against them. I can see no basis whatsoever in the language of the Constitution for allowing persons like appellant the benefit of those rights and yet denying them a jury trial, a right which is surely one of the fundamental aspects of criminal justice in the English-speaking world.\n\n\n15\nThe Court here decides that it would not be 'appropriate' to decide this issue in light of DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U.S. 631, 88 S.Ct. 2093, 20 L.Ed.2d 1308 (1968). That case held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial\u2014made applicable to the States in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968)\u2014did not apply in state proceedings held prior to May 20, 1968. Mr. Justice Douglas and I dissented in that case as we have in every case holding that constitutional decisions would take effect only from the day they were announced.4 I think this doctrine of prospective-only application is nothing less than judicial amendment of the Constitution, since it results in the Constitution's meaning one thing the day prior to a particular decision and something entirely different the next day even though the language remains the same. Under our system of government such amendments cannot constitutionally be made by judges but only by the action of Congress and the people. Depriving defendants of jury trials prior to Duncan violated the Constitution just as much as would similar deprivations after that decision, yet this Court treats these equal deprivation with clearly unequal justice. I cannot agree to such refusals to apply what appear to me to be the clear commends of the Constitution.\n\n\n16\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\n\n17\nIn DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U.S. 631, 635, 88 S.Ct. 2093, 2096, 20 L.Ed.2d 1308, I stated my view that the decisions in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491, and Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194, 88 S.Ct. 1477, 20 L.Ed.2d 522, which guaranteed to adults in serious criminal cases and contempts the right to a trial by jury, should be given retroactive effect.* In light of this view, I am unable to join the Court's per curiam opinion in this case, holding that because appellant's juvenile court hearing was held prior to the date of the decisions in Duncan and Bloom the Court is precluded from deciding appellant's right to a jury trial.\n\n\n18\nI would reach the merits and hold that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments require a jury trial as a matter of right where the delinquency charged is an offense that, if the person were an adult, would be a crime triable by jury. Such is this case, for behind the facade of delinquency is the crime of forgery.\n\n\n19\nAs originally conceived, the juvenile court was to be a clinic, not a court; the judge and all of the attendants were visualized as white-coated experts there to supervise, enlighten, and cure\u2014not to punish.\n\n\n20\nThese white-coated people were surrogates, so to speak, of the natural parent. As stated in one of the leading cases:\n\n\n21\n'To save a child from becoming a criminal, or from continuing      in a career of crime, to end in maturer years in public punishment and disgrace, the legislature      surely may provide for the salvation of such a child, if its      parents or guardian be unable or unwilling to do so, by      bringing it into one of the courts of the state without any      process at all, for the purpose of subjecting it to the      state's guardianship and protection. The natural parent needs      no process to temporarily deprive his child of its liberty by      confining it in his own home, to save it and to shield it      from the consequences of persistence in a career of      waywardness, nor is the state, when compelled, as parens      patriae, to take the place of the father for the same      purpose, required to adopt any process as a means of placing      its hands upon the child to lead it into one of its courts.      When the child gets there and the court with the power to      save it, determines on its salvation, and not its punishment,      it is immaterial how it got there. The act simply provides      how children who ought to be saved may reach the court to be      saved.' Commonwealth v. Fisher, 213 Pa. 48, 53, 62 A. 198,      200 (1905).\n\n\n22\nThis new agency\u2014which stood in the shoes of the parent or guardian\u2014was to draw on all the medical, psychological, and psychiatric knowledge of the day and transform the delinquent. These experts motivated by love were to transform troubled children into normal ones, saving them from criminal careers.\n\n\n23\nMany things happened that prevented this dream from becoming a widespread reality. First, municipal budgets were not equal to the task of enticing experts to enter this field in large numbers. Second, such experts as we had, notably the psychiatrists and analysts, were drawn away by the handsome fees they could receive for rehabilitating the rich. Third, the love and tenderness alone, possessed by the white-coated judge and attendants, were not sufficient to untangle the web of subconscious influences that possessed the troubled youngster. Fourth, correctional institutions designed to care for these delinquents often became miniature prisons with many of the same vicious aspects as the adult models. Fifth, the secrecy of the juvenile proceedings led to some overreaching and arbitrary actions.\n\n\n24\nAs Mr. Justice Fortas stated in Kent v. United States, 383 U.S. 541, 556, 86 S.Ct. 1045, 1054, 16 L.Ed.2d 84, 'There is evidence, in fact, that there may be grounds for concern that the child receives the worst of both worlds: that he gets neither the protections accorded to adults nor the solicitous care and regenerative treatment postulated for children.'\n\n\n25\nIn Kent, the Court held that a valid waiver of the 'exclusive' jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court of the District of Columbia required 'a hearing, including access by * * * counsel to the social records and probation or similar reports which presumably are considered by the court, and * * * a statement of reasons for the Juvenile Court's decision.' Id., at 557, 86 S.Ct., at 1055. Although the opinion in that case emphasized that 'the basic requirements of due process and fairness' be satisfied in such proceedings, id., at 553, 86 S.Ct., at 1053, the decision itself turned on the language of a federal statute.\n\n\n26\nThe first expansive treatment of the constitutional requirements of due process in juvenile court proceedings was undertaken in In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527. That case involved a 15-year-old boy who had been committed by an Arizona juvenile court to the State Industrial School 'for the period of his minority, unless sooner discharged by due process of law' for allegedly making lewd telephone calls. The Court in Gault abandoned the view that due process was a concept alien to the philosophy and work of the juvenile courts. Mr. Justice Fortas, speaking for the Court, stated: 'Under our Constitution, the condition of being a boy does not justify a kangaroo court.' Id., at 28, 87 S.Ct., at 1444. The Court held that a juvenile is entitled to adequate and timely notice of the charges against him, the right to counsel, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, and the privilege against self-incrimination.\n\n\n27\nSince the decision in Gault, lower courts have divided on the question whether there is a right to jury trial in juvenile proceedings. Those courts which have granted the right felt that it was implicit in Gault. Nieves v. United States, 280 F.Supp. 994 (D.C.S.D.N.Y.1968); Peyton v. Nord, 78 N.M. 717, 437 P.2d 716 (1968); In re Rindell, 2 BNA Cr.L. 3121 (Providence, R. I., Fam. Ct., Jan. 1968). Those who have denied the right have reasoned either that jury trial is not a dundamental right applicable to the States or that it is not consistent with the concept of a juvenile court. People v. Anonymous, 56 Misc.2d 725, 289 N.Y.S.2d 782 (Sup.Ct.1968); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 211 Pa.Super. 62, 234 A.2d 9 (1967). Duncan and Bloom have negated the former reason. Whether a jury trial is in conflict with the juvenile court's underlying philosophy is irrelevant, for the Constitution is the Supreme Law of the land.\n\n\n28\nGiven the fundamental nature of the right to jury trial as expressed in Duncan and Bloom, there is, as I see it, no constitutionally sufficient reason to deprive the juvenile of this right. The balancing of the rehabilitative purpose of the juvenile proceeding with the due process requirement of a jury trial is a matter for a future Constitutional Convention.\n\n\n29\nThe idea of a juvenile court certainly was not the development of a juvenile criminal court. It was to have a healthy specialized clinic, not to conduct criminal trials in evasion of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Where there is a criminal trial charging a criminal offense, whether in conventional terms or in the language of delinquency, all of the procedural requirements of the Constitution and Bill of Rights come into play.\n\n\n30\nI would reverse this judgment.\n\n\n\n1\n 'Delinquent child shall mean any child under the age of eighteen years who has violated any law of the state or any city or village ordinance.' Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 43-201(4). Appellant was charged with having a forged check in his possession with the intent to utter it as genuine, an act which for an adult would be forgery under Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 28-601(2).\n\n\n2\n Appellant was 17 when committed, and it appears that under Nebrasa law he could be kept in the training school until his 21st birthday.\n\n\n3\n Four of the seven justices of the Nebraska Supreme Court thought the Nebraska statutory provisions which require that juvenile hearings be without a jury, Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 43-206.03(2), and be based on the preponderance of the evidence, Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 43-206.03(3), were unconstitutional. The Nebraska Constitution provides, however, that: 'No legislative act shall be held unconstitutional except by the concurrence of five judges.' Neb.Const., Art. V, \u00a7 2.\n\n\n4\n Although a comment made by appellant's counsel at oral argument before this Court (in response to a question) suggests reliance also on the Equal Protection Clause for the claim that a jury trial was constitutionally required (Tr. 5), an examination of the record clearly reveals that this was not any part of the basis on which probable jurisdiction was noted here. Appellant made no equal protection claim before the juvenile court, in his petition for habeas corpus to the state courts, or in his jurisdictional statement or brief in this Court. The Sixth Amendment as reflected in the Fourteenth was the exclusive basis for appellant's claim that he had a right to jury trial. (See 'Questions Presented' in Jurisdictional Statement 3-4, and Appellant's Brief 2.) Nor has any of the Nebraska courts below passed on any equal protection claim.\n\n\n5\n This Court has recently noted probable jurisdiction to consider this issue in In re Winship (No. 85, Misc.), probable jurisdiction noted, 396 U.S. 885, 90 S.Ct. 179, 24 L.Ed.2d 160.\n\n\n6\n In his petition for state habeas corpus, appellant did not allege as to this issue that any Nebraska statutory provision was invalid. Instead he claimed: 'Petitioner is deprived of his liberty under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States when his right to a jury trial and the protective procedures of the criminal code are left to depend on the uncontrolled discretion of the prosecutor as to whether petitioner should be proceeded against in juvenile court or should be informed against in District Court under the provisions of the code of criminal procedure.' If it can be fairly said that the prosecutor's discretion under Nebraska law is 'uncontrolled,' or not subject to review, this is not because of any explicit statutory provision making it such, cf. Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 43-205.04, but because of language in Nebraska case law. See State v. McCoy, 145 Nev. 750, 18 N.W.2d 101 (1945); Fugate v. Ronin, 167 Neb. 70, 75, 91 N.W.2d 240, 243-244 (1958).\n\n\n1\n Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 43-201(4) provides that: 'Delinquent child shall mean any child under the age of eighteen years who has violated any law of the state or any city or village ordinance.'\n\n\n2\n The State charged that appellant 'unlawfully, feloniously and knowingly [had] in his possession and custody a certain false, forged and counterfeited bank check * * * with the intent * * * to utter and publish said false, forged and counterfeited bank check as true and genuine, knowing the same to be a false, forged and counterfeited bank check, and with the intent then and there and thereby to prejudice, damage and defraud * * *, well knowing the same to be falsely made, forged and counterfeited, contrary to the form of the Statutes in such cases made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the State of Nebraska.' App. 1-2. It is undisputed that such acts constitute the crime of forgery under state law. Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 28-601(2).\n\n\n3\n Neb.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 43-206.03(2) provides that juvenile hearings 'shall be conducted by the judge without a jury in an informal manner * * *.'\n\n\n4\n Linkletter v.

{"text":"356 U.S. 560\n78 S.Ct. 844\n2 L.Ed.2d 975\nFrank Andrew PAYNE, Petitioner,v.STATE OF ARKANSAS.\nNo. 99.\nArgued March 3, 1958.\nDecided May 19, 1958.\n\nMr. Wiley A. Branton, Pine Bluff, Ark., for the petitioner.\nMr. Throp Thomas, Little Rock, Ark., for the respondent.\nMr. Justice WHITTAKER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner, a 19-year-old Negro, was convicted by a jury in Jefferson County, Arkansas, of first degree murder and sentenced to death by electrocution. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Arkansas he pressed two main contentions: (1) that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress, and in receiving in evidence over his objection, a coerced and false confession, and that the error takes and deprives him of his life without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, and (2) that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to quash the panel of petit jurors upon the ground that Negroes were systematically excluded, or their number limited, in the selection of the jury panel, and that the error deprives him of the equal protection of the laws and of due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. The court held that these contentions were without merit and affirmed the judgment. 226 Ark. 910, 295 S.W.2d 312, 313. He then applied to us for a writ of certiorari, based on these contentions, which we granted because the constitutional questions presented appeared to be substantial. 353 U.S. 929, 77 S.Ct. 721, 1 L.Ed.2d 723.\n\n\n2\nWe will first consider petitioner's contention that the confession was coerced, and that its admission in evidence over his objection denied him due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n3\nThe use in a state criminal trial of a defendant's confession obtained by coercion\u2014whether physical or mental\u2014is forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment.1 Enforcement of the criminal laws of the States rests principally with the state courts, and generally their findings of fact, fairly made upon substantial and conflicting testimony as to the circumstances producing the contested confession\u2014as distinguished from inadequately supported findings or conclusions drawn from uncontroverted happenings\u2014are not this Court's concern;2 yet where the claim is that the prisoner's confession is the product of coercion we are bound to make our own examination of the record to determine whether the claim is meritorious. 'The performance of this duty cannot be foreclosed by the finding of a court, or the verdict of a jury, or both.'3 The question for our decision then is whether the confession was coerced. That question can be answered only by reviewing the circumstances under which the confession was made. We therefore proceed to examine those circumstances as shown by this record.\n\n\n4\nNear 6:30 p.m. on October 4, 1955, J. M. Robertson, an elderly retail lumber dealer in the City of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, was found in his office dead or dying from crushing blows inflicted upon his head. More than $450 was missing from the cash drawer. Petitioner, a 19-year-old Negro with a fifth-grade education,4 who had been employed by Robertson for several weeks, was suspected of the crime. He was interrogated that night at his home by the police, but they did not then arrest him. Near 11 a.m. the next day, October 5, he was arrested without a warrant and placed in a cell on the first floor of the city jail. Arkansas statutes provide that an arrest may be made without a warrant when an officer 'has reasonable grounds for believing that the person arrested has committed a felony,'5 and that when an arrest is made without a warrant the person arrested 'shall be forthwith carried before the most convenient magistrate of the county in which the arrest is made,'6 and when the person arrested is brought before such magistrate it is the latter's duty to 'state the charge (against the accused and to) inquire * * * whether he desires the aid of counsel (and to allow him) a reasonable opportunity' to obtain counsel.7 It is admitted that petitioner, though arrested without a warrant, was never taken before a magistrate, and that the statutes mentioned were not complied with.\n\n\n5\nPetitioner was held incommunicado without any charge against him from the time of his arrest at 11 a.m. on October 5 until after his confession on the afternoon of October 7, without counsel, advisor or friend being permitted to see him. Members of his family who sought to see him were turned away, because the police did not 'make it a practice of letting anyone talk to (prisoners) while they are being questioned.' Two of petitioner's brothers and three of his nephews were, to his knowledge, brought by the police to the city jail and questioned during the evening of petitioner's arrest, and one of his brothers was arrested and held in jail overnight. Petitioner asked permission to make a telephone call but his request was denied.\n\n\n6\nPetitioner was not given lunch after being lodged in the city jail on October 5, and missed the evening meal on that day because he was then being questioned in the office of the chief of police. Near 6:30 the next morning, October 6, he was taken by the police, without breakfast, and also without shoes or socks,8 on a trip to Little Rock, a distance of about 45 miles, for further questioning and a lie detector test, arriving there about 7:30 a.m. He was not given breakfast in that city, but was turned over to the state police who gave him a lie detector test and questioned him for an extended time not shown in the record. At about 1 p.m. that day he was given shoes and also two sandwiches\u2014the first food he had received in more than 25 hours. He was returned to the city jail in Pine Bluff at about 6:30 that evening\u2014too late for the evening meal\u2014and placed in a cell on the second floor. The next morning, October 7, he was given breakfast\u2014which, except for the two sandwiches he had been given at Little Rock at 1 p.m. the day before, was the only food he had received in more than 40 hours.\n\n\n7\nWe come now to an even more vital matter. Petitioner testified,9 concerning the conduct that immediately induced his confession, as follows: 'I was locked up upstairs and Chief Norman Young came up (about 1 p.m. on October 7) and told me that I had not told him all of the story\u2014he said that there was 30 or 40 people outside that wanted to get me, and he said if I would come in and tell him the truth that he would probably keep them from coming in.' When again asked what the chief of police had said to him on that occasion petitioner testified: 'Chief Norman Young said thirty or forty people were outside wanting to get in to me and he asked me if I wanted to make a confession he would try to keep them out.' The chief of police, on cross-examination, admitted that he had made the substance of that statement to petitioner,10 and had told him that he would be permitted to confess to the chief 'in private.' In this setting, petitioner immediately agreed to make a statement to the chief. The chief then took petitioner to his private office, and almost immediately after arriving at that place there was a knock on the door. The chief opened the door and stepped outside, leaving the door ajar, and petitioner heard him say \"He is fixing to confess now,' and he would like to have me alone.' Petitioner did not know what persons or how many were outside the door. The chief re-entered his office and began questioning petitioner who orally confessed that he had committed the crime. Thereupon Sergeant Halsell of the State Police and Sheriff Norton were admitted to the room, and under questioning by Sergeant Halsell petitioner gave more details concerning the crime. Soon afterward a court reporter was called in and several businessmen were also admitted to the room. Sergeant Halsell then requestioned petitioner and the questions and answers were taken by the reporter in shorthand. After being transcribed by the reporter, the typed transcription was returned to the room about 3 p.m. and was read and signed to petitioner and witnessed by the officers and businessmen referred to. Thus the 'confession' was obtained.\n\n\n8\nAt the beginning of the trial petitioner's counsel moved to suppress the confession because obtained by coercion culminating in a threat of mob violence. Following Arkansas procedure (McClellan v. State, 203 Ark. 386, 156 S.W.2d 800), a hearing upon that motion was held before the trial judge in chambers, at which the facts above recited were shown without dispute. In addition petitioner testified that the confession did not contain the truth, and when asked why he made it, he answered: 'Well, as a matter of fact lawyer Branton I was more than afraid because Chief Norman Young had already told me that there was 30 or 40 people outside and the way he stated it, if I hadn't, if I didn't make the confession that he would let them in, from the conversation, from the way that he told me.' The trial judge overruled the motion to supporess the confession. The same evidence was then repeated before the jury, and the confession was admitted in evidence over petitioiner's objection. The court instructed the jury to disregard the confession if they found it was not voluntarily made. The jury returned a general verdict finding petitioner guilty of first degree murder as charged and assessed the penalty of death by electrocution. Judgment accordingly was entered on the verdict.\n\n\n9\nThat petitioner was not physically tortured affords no answer to the question whether the confession was coerced, for '(t)here is torture of mind as well as body; the will is as much affected by fear as by force. * * * A confession by which life becomes forfeit must be the expression of free choice.' Watts v. State of Indiana, 338 U.S. 49, 52, 53, 69 S.Ct. 1347, 1349, 93 L.Ed. 1801.11 The undisputed evidence in this case shows that petitioner, a mentally dull 19-year-old youth, (1) was arrested without a warrant, (2) was denied a hearing before a magistrate at which he would have been advised of his right to remain silent and of his right to counsel, as required by Arkansas statutes, (3) was not advised of his right to remain silent or of his right to counsel, (4) was held incommunicado for three days, without counsel, advisor or friend, and though members of his family tried to see him they were turned away, and he was refused permission to make even one telephone call, (5) was denied food for long periods, and, finally, (6) was told by the chief of police 'that there would be 30 or 40 people there in a few minutes that wanted to get him,' which statement created such fear in petitioner as immediately produced the 'confession.' It seems obvious from the totality of this course of conduct,12 and particularly the culminating threat of mob violence, that the confession was coerced and did not constitute an 'expression of free choice,'13 and that its use before the jury, over petitioiner's objection, deprived him of 'that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept of justice,'14 and, hence, denied him due process of law, guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n10\nRespondent suggests that, apart from the confession, there was adequate evidence before the jury to sustain the verdict. But where, as here, a coerced confession constitutes a part of the evidence before the jury and a general verdict is returned, no one can say what credit and weight the jury gave to the confession. And in these circumstances this Court has uniformly held that even though there may have been sufficient evidence, apart from the coerced confession, to support a judgment of conviction, the admission in evidence, over objection, of the coerced confession vitiates the judgment because it violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.15\n\n\n11\nThe admitted facts, set out above, make applicable the conclusion reached in Chambers v. State of Florida, 309 U.S. 227, 241, 60 S.Ct. 472, 479, 84 L.Ed. 716: 'Due process of law, preserved for all by our Constitution, commands that no such practice as that disclosed by this record shall send any accused to his death.' The judgment must be reversed because of the admission in evidence of the coerced confession. It is therefore unnecessary at this time for us to discuss or decide the other question presented by petitioner\u2014whether the overruling of his motion to quash the panel of petit jurors upon the ground that Negroes were systematically excluded, or their number limited, in the selection of the jury panel denied him the equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2014for we will not assume that the same issue will be present upon a new trial.\n\n\n12\nThe judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n13\nReversed.\n\n\n14\nMr. Justice HARLAN, concurring.\n\n\n15\nI join in the reversal of the judgment in this case because the Police Chief's testimony, quoted in footnote 10 of the Court's opinion, seems to me to require acceptance of petitioner's claim that his confession was induced through fear of mob violence.\n\n\n16\nMr. Justice BURTON, on this record, would accept the conclusion of the state court and jury that petitioner's confession was voluntary. Therefore, he would affirm the judgment rendered. See his dissent in Moore v. State of Michigan, 355 U.S. 155, 165, 78 S.Ct. 191, 197, 2 L.Ed.2d 167.\n\n\n17\nMr. Justice CLARK, dissenting.\n\n\n18\nI believe that on this record the state courts properly held petitioner's confession voluntary. Moreover, even if the confession be deemed coerced, there is sufficient other evidence of guilt to sustain the conviction on the authority of Stein v. People of State of New York, 1953, 346 U.S. 156, 188\u2014194, 73 S.Ct. 1077, 1094\u20141098, 97 L.Ed. 1522. Just five years ago this Court established in Stein that there was no constitutional error 'if the jury admitted and relied on the confession,' or 'rejected it and convicted on other evidence.' 346 U.S. at pages 193\u2014194, 73 S.Ct. at page 1097. For purpose of making the latter determination, this Court assumed there that the confession was found coerced by the jury. It makes no difference that the determination of coercion here is by this Court rather than by the jury, for as is evident from the majority opinion, the inquiry is the same\u2014whether the confession was coerced. I must apply the Stein rule here because the Arkansas procedure on admission of challenged confessions is identical to that which we approved in that case. See Nolan v. State, 205 Ark. 103, 104, 167 S.W.2d 503, 504; Dinwiddie v. State, 202 Ark. 562, 570, 151 S.W.2d 93, 95, 96.\n\n\n\n1\n See, e.g., Brown v. State of Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278, 56 S.Ct. 461, 80 L.Ed. 682; Chambers v. State of Florida, 309 U.S. 227, 60 S.Ct. 472, 84 L.Ed. 716; Lisenba v.

Indeed it was there recognized that when 'the ruling admitting the confession is found on review to be erroneous, the conviction, at least normally, should fall with the confession. * * * (R)eliance on a coerced confession vitiates a conviction because such a confession combines the persuasiveness of apparent conclusiveness with what judicial experience shows to be illusory and deceptive evidence.

{"text":"417 U.S. 733\n94 S.Ct. 2547.\n41 L.Ed.2d 439\nJocob J. PARKER, Warden, et al., Appellants,v.Howard B. LEVY.\nNo. 73\u2014206.\nArgued Feb. 20, 1974.\nDecided June 19, 1974.\n\nSyllabus\nArticle 90(2) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (Code) provides for punishment of any person subject to the Code who 'willfully disobeys a lawful command of his superior commissioned officer'; Art. 133 punishes a commissioned officer for 'conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman'; and Art. 134 (the general article) punishes any person subject to the Code for, inter alia, 'all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces,' though not specifically mentioned in the Code. Appellee, an Army physician assigned to a hospital, was convicted by a general court-martial of violating Art. 90(2) for disobeying the hospital commandant's order to establish a training program for Special Forces aide men, and of violating Arts. 133 and 134 for making public statements urging Negro enlisted men to refuse to obey orders to go to Vietnam and referring to Special Forces personnel as 'liars and thieves,' 'killers of peasants,' and 'murders of women and children.' After his conviction was sustained within the military and he exhausted this avenue of relief, appellee sought habeas corpus relief in the District Court, challenging his conviction on the ground that both Art. 133 and Art. 134 are 'void for vagueness' under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and overbroad in violation of the First Amendment. The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that Arts. 133 and 134 are void for vagueness, that while appellee's conduct fell within an example of Art. 134 violations contained in the Manual for Courts-Martial, the possibility that the articles would be applied to others' future conduct as to which there was insufficient warning, or which was within the area of protected First Amendment expression, was enough to give appellee standing to challenge both articles on their face, and that the joint consideration of the Art. 90 charges gave rise to a 'reasonable possibility' that appellee's right to a fair trial was prejudiced, so that a new trial was required. Held:\n1. Articles 133 and 134 are not unconstitutionally vague under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Pp. 752\u2014757.\n(a) Each article has been construed by the United States Court of Military Appeals or by other military authorities, such as the Manual for Courts-Martial, so as to limit its scope, thus narrowing the very broad reach of the literal language of the articles, and at the same time supplying considerable specificity by way of examples of the conduct that they cover. Pp. 752\u2014755.\n(b) The articles are not subject to being condemned for specifying no standard of conduct at all, but are of the type of statutes which 'by their terms or as authoritatively construed apply without question to certain activities, but whose application to other behavior is uncertain,' Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, 578, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 39 L.Ed.2d 605. Pp. 755\u2014756.\n(c) Because of the factors differentiating military from civilian society, Congress is permitted to legislate with greater breadth and flexibility when prescribing rules for the former than when prescribing rules for the latter, and the proper standard of review for a vagueness challenge to Code articles is the standard that applies to criminal statutes regulating economic affairs, and that standard was met here, since appellee could have had no reasonable doubt that his statements urging Negro enlisted men not to go to Vietnam if ordered to do so was both 'unbecoming an officer and gentleman' and 'to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces,' in violation of Arts. 133 and 134, respectively. Pp. 756\u2014757.\n2. Nor are Arts. 133 and 134 facially invalid because of overbreadth. Pp. 757\u2014761.\n(a) Doctrines of First Amendment overbreadth asserted in support of challenges to imprecise language like that contained in Arts. 133 and 134 are not exempt from the operation of the principles that while military personnel are not excluded from First Amendment protection, the fundamental necessity for obedience, and the consequent necessity for discipline, may render permissible within the military that which would be constitutionally impermissible outside it. Pp. 758\u2014759.\n(b) There is a wide range of conduct to which Arts. 133 and 134 may be applied without infringing the First Amendment, and while there may be marginal applications in which First Amendment values would be infringed, this is insufficient to invalidate either article at appellee's behest. His conduct in publicly urging enlisted personnel to refuse to obey orders which might send them into combat was unprotected under the most expansive notions of the First Amendment, and Arts. 133 and 134 may constitutionally prohibit that conduct, and a sufficiently large number of similar or related types of conduct so as to preclude their invalidation for overbreadth. Pp. 760\u2014761.\n3. Appellee's contention that even if Arts. 133 and 134 are constitutional, his conviction under Art. 90 should be invalidated because to carry out the hospital commandant's order would have constituted participation in a war crime and because the commandant gave the order, knowing it would be disobeyed, for the sole purpose of increasing appellee's punishment, is not of constitutional significance and is beyond the scope of review, since such defenses were resolved against appellee on a factual basis by the court-martial that convicted him. P. 761.\n3 Cir., 478 F.2d 772, reversed.\nSol. Gen. Robert H. Bork, for appellants.\nCharles Morgan, Jr., Atlanta, Ga., for appellee.\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nAppellee Howard Levy, a physician, was a captain in the Army stationed at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. He had entered the Army under the so-called 'Berry Plan,'1 under which he agreed to serve for two years in the Armed Forces if permitted first to complete his medical training. From the time he entered on active duty in July 1965 until his trial by court-martial, he was assigned as Chief of the Dermatological Service of the United States Army Hospital at Fort Jackson. On June 2, 1967, appellee was convicted by a general court-martial of violations of Arts. 90, 133, and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and sentenced to dismissal from the service, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for three years at hard labor.\n\n\n2\nThe facts upon which his conviction rests are virtually undisputed. The evidence admitted at his court-martial trial showed that one of the functions of the hospital to which appellee was assigned was that of training Special Forces aide men. As Chief of the Dermatological Service, appellee was to conduct a clinic for those aide men. In the late summer of 1966, it came to the attention of the hospital commander that the dermatology training of the students was unsatisfactory. After investigating the program and determining that appellee had totally neglected his duties, the commander called appellee to his office and personally handed him a written order to conduct the training. Appellee read the order, said that he understood it, but declared that he would not obey it because of his medical ethics. Appellee persisted in his refusal to obey the order, and later reviews of the program established that the training was still not being carried out.\n\n\n3\nDuring the same period of time, appellee made several public statements to enlisted personnel at the post, of which the following is representative:\n\n\n4\n'The United States is wrong in being involved in the Viet Nam War. I would refuse to go to Viet Nam if ordered      to do so. I don't see why any colored soldier would go to      Viet Nam: they should refuse to go to Viet Nam and if sent      should refuse to fight because they are discriminated against      and denied their freedom in the United States, and they are      sacrificed and discriminated against in Viet Nam by being      given all the hazardous duty and they are suffering the      majority of casualties. If I were a colored soldier I would      refuse to go to Viet Nam and if I were a colored soldier and      were sent I would refuse to fight. Special Forces personnel      are liars and thieves and killers of peasants and murderers      of women and children.'\n\n\n5\nAppellee's military superiors originally contemplated nonjudicial proceedings against him under Art. 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815, but later determined that courtmartial proceedings were appropriate. The specification under Art. 90 alleged that appellee willfully disobeyed the hospital commandant's order to establish the training program, in violation of that article, which punishes anyone subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice who 'willfully disobeys a lawful command of his superior commissioned officer.'2 Statements to enlisted personnel were listed as specifications under the charges of violating Arts. 133 and 134 of the Code. Article 133 provides for the punishment of 'conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman,'3 while Art. 134 proscribes, inter alia, 'all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces.'4\n\n\n6\nThe specification under Art. 134 alleged that appellee 'did, at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, . . . with design to promote disloyalty and disaffection among the troops, publicly utter (certain) statements to divers enlisted personnel at divers times . . ..'5 The specification under Art. 133 alleged that appellee did 'while in the performance of his duties at the United States Army Hospital . . . wrongfully and dishonorably' make statements variously described as intemperate, defamatory, provoking, disloyal, contemptuous, and disrespectful to Special Forces personnel and to enlisted personnel who were patients or under his supervision.6\n\n\n7\nAppellee was convicted by the courtmartial, and his conviction was sustained on his appeals within the military.7 After he had exhausted this avenue of relief, he sought federal habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, challenging his court-martial conviction on a number of grounds. The District Court, on the basis of the voluminous record of the military proceedings and the argument of counsel, denied relief. It held that the 'various articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice are not unconstitutional for vagueness,' citing several decisions of the United States Court of Military Appeals.8 The court rejected the balance of appellee's claims without addressing them individually, noting that the military tribunals had given fair consideration to them and that the role of the federal courts in reviewing court-martial proceedings was a limited one.\n\n\n8\nThe Court of Appeals reversed, holding in a lengthy opinion that Arts. 133 and 134 are void for vagueness. 478 F.2d 772 (CA3 1973). The court found little difficulty in concluding that 'as measured by contemporary standards of vagueness applicable to statutes and ordinances governing civilians,' the general articles 'do not pass constitutional muster.' It relied on such cases as Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972); Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110 (1972); Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U.S. 399, 86 S.Ct. 518, 15 L.Ed.2d 447 (1966); Coates v. City of Cincinnati, 402 U.S. 611, 91 S.Ct. 1686, 29 L.Ed.2d 214 (1971), and Gelling v. Texas, 343 U.S. 960, 72 S.Ct. 1002, 96 L.Ed. 1359 (1952). The Court of Appeals did not rule that appellee was punished for doing things he could not reasonably have known constituted conduct proscribed by Art. 133 or 134. Indeed, it recognized that his conduct fell within one of the examples of Art. 134 violations contained in the Manual for Courts-Martial, promulgated by the President by Executive Order.9 Nonetheless, relying chiefly on Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S. 518, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972), the Court found the possibility that Arts. 133 and 134 would be applied to future conduct of others as to which there was insufficient warning, or which was within the area of protected First Amendment expression, was enough to give\n\n\n\n8\n United States v. Howe, 17 U.S.C.M.A. 165, 37 C.M.R. 429 (1967); United States v. Sadinsky, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 563, 34 C.M.R. 343 (1964); United States v. Frantz, 2 U.S.C.M.A. 161, 7 C.M.R. 37 (1953).\n\n\n9\n Manual for Courts-Martial 213f(5) (1969). appellee standing to challenge both articles on their face. While it acknowledged that different standards might in some circumstances be applicable in considering vagueness challenges to provisions which govern the conduct of members of the Armed Forces, the Court saw in the case of Arts. 133 and 134 no 'countervailing military considerations which justify the twisting of established standards of due process in order to hold inviolate these articles, so clearly repugnant under current constitutional values.' Turning finally to appellee's conviction under Art. 90, the Court held that the joint consideration of Art. 90 charges with the charges under Arts. 133 and 134 gave rise to a 'reasonable possibility' that appellee's right to a fair trial was prejudiced, so that a new trial was required.\nAppellants appealed to this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We set the case for oral argument, and postponed consideration of the question of our jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits. 414 U.S. 973, 94 S.Ct. 286, 38 L.Ed.2d 216 (1973)10\n\n\n*\n This Court has long recognized that the military is, by necessity, a specialized society separate from civilian society. We have also recognized that the military has, again by necessity, developed laws and traditions of its own during its long history. The differences between the military and civilian communities result from the fact that 'it is the primary business of armies and navies to fight or ready to fight wars should the occasion arise.' United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U.S. 11, 17, 76 S.Ct. 1, 5, 100 L.Ed. 8 (1955). In In re Grimley, 137 U.S. 147, 153, 11 S.Ct. 54, 55, 34 L.Ed. 636 (1890), the Court observed: 'An army is not a deliberative body. It is the executive arm. Its law is that of obedience. No question can be left open as to the right to command in the officer, or the duty of obedience in the soldier.' More recently we noted that '(t)he military constitutes a specialized community governed by a separate discipline from that of the civilian,' Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U.S. 83, 94, 73 S.Ct. 534, 540, 97 L.Ed. 842 (1953), and that 'the rights of men in the armed forces must perforce be conditioned to meet certain overriding demands of discipline and duty . . ..' Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137, 140, 73 S.Ct. 1045, 97 L.Ed. 1508 (1953) (plurality opinion). We have also recognized that a military officer holds a particular position of responsibility and command in the Armed Forces:\n'The President's commission . . . recites that 'reposing      special trust and confidence in the patriotism, valor,      fidelity and abilities' of the appointee he is named to the      specified rank during the pleasure of the President.' Orloff      v. Willoughby, supra, at 91, 73 S.Ct., at 539.\nJust as military society has been a society apart from civilian society, so '(m)ilitary law . . . is a jurisprudence which exists separate and apart from the law which governs in our federal judicial establishment.' Burns v. Wilson, supra, at 140, 73 S.Ct., at 1047. And to maintain the discipline essential to perform its mission effectively, the military has developed what 'may not unfitly be called the customary military law' or 'general usage of the military service.' Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19, 35, 6 L.Ed. 537 (1827). As the opinion in Martin v. Mott demonstrates, the Court has approved the enforcement of those military customs and usages by courts-martial from the early days of this Nation:\n'. . . Courts Martial, when duly organized, are bound to      execute their duties, and regulate their modes of proceeding,      in the absence of positive enactments.\nUpon any other principle, Courts Martial would be left      without any adequate means to exercise the authority confided      to them: for there could scarcely be framed a positive code      to provide for the infinite variety of incidents applicable      to them.' Id. at 35\u201436.\nAn examination of the British antecedents of our military law shows that the military law of Britian had long contained the forebears of Arts. 133 and 134 in remarkably similar language. The Articles of the Earl of Essex (1642) provided that '(a)ll other faults, disorders and offenses, not mentioned in these Articles, shall be punished according to the general customs and laws of war.' One of the British Articles of War of 1765 made punishable 'all Disorders or Neglects . . . to the Prejudice of good Order and Military Discipline . . .' that were not mentioned in the other articles.11 Another of those articles provided:\n'Whatsoever Commissioned Officer shall be convicted before a      General Court-martial, of behaving in a scandalous infamous      Manner, such as is unbecoming the Character of an Officer and      a Gentleman, shall be discharged from Our Service.'12\nIn 1775 the Continental Congress adopted this last article, along with 68 others for the governance of its army.13 The following year it was resolved by the Congress that 'the committee on spies be directed to revise the rules and articles of war; this being a committee of five, consisting of John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, John Rutledge, James Wilson and R. R. Livingston . . ..'14 The article was included in the new set of articles prepared by the Committee, which Congress adopted on September 20, 1776.15 After being once more re-enacted without change in text in 1786, it was revised and expanded in 1806, omitting the terms 'scandalous' and 'infamous,' so as to read:\n'Any commissioned officer convicted before a general      court-martial of conduct unbecoming an officer and a      gentleman, shall be dismissed (from) the service.'16\nFrom 1806, it remained basically unchanged through numerous congressional re-enactments until it was enacted as Art. 133 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 1951.\nThe British article punishing 'all Disorders and Neglects . . .' was also adopted by the Continental Congress in 1775 and re-enacted in 1776.17 Except for a revision in 1916, which added the clause punishing 'all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the military service,'18 substantially the same language was preserved throughout the various re-enactments of this article too, until in 1951 it was enacted as Art. 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\nDecisions of this Court during the last century have recognized that the longstanding customs and usages of the services impart accepted meaning to the seemingly imprecise standards of Arts. 133 and 134. In Dynes v. Hoover, 20 How. 65, 15 L.Ed. 838 (1857), this Court upheld the Navy's general article, which provided that '(a)ll crimes committed by persons belonging to the navy, which are not specified in the foregoing articles, shall be punished according to the laws and customs in such cases at sea.' The Court reasoned:\n'(W)hen offences and crimes are not given in terms or by      definition, the want of it may be supplied by a comprehensive      enactment, such as the 32d article of the rules for the      government of the navy, which means that courts martial have      jurisdiction of such crimes as are not specified, but which      have been recognised to be crimes and offences by the usages      in the navy of all nations, and that they shall be punished      according to the laws and customs of the sea. Notwithstanding      the apparent indeterminateness of such a provision, it is not      liable to abuse; for what those crimes are, and how they are      to be punished, is well known by practical men in the navy      and army, and by those who have studied the law of courts      martial, and the offences of which the different courts      martial have cognizance.' Id., at 82.\nIn Smith v. Whitney, 116 U.S. 167, 6 S.Ct. 570, 29 L.Ed. 601 (1886), this Court refused to issue a writ of prohibition against Smith's court-martial trial on charges of '(s)candalous conduct tending to the destruction of good morals' and '(c)ulpable inefficiency in the performance of duty.' The Court again recognized the role of 'the usages and customs of war' and 'old practice in the army' in the interpretation of military law by military tribunals. Id., at 178\u2014179, 6 S.Ct., at 576.\nIn United States v. Fletcher, 148 U.S. 84, 13 S.Ct. 552, 37 L.Ed. 378 (1893), the Court considered a court-martial conviction under what is now Art. 133, rejecting Captain Fletcher's claim that the court-marital could not properly have held that his refusal to pay a just debt was 'conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.' The Court of Claims decision which the Court affirmed in Fletcher stressed the military's 'higher code termed honor, which holds its society to stricter accountability'19 and with which those trained only in civilian law are unfamiliar. In Swaim v. United States, 165 U.S. 553, 17 S.Ct. 448, 41 L.Ed. 823 (1897), the Court affirmed another Court of Claims decision, this time refusing to disturb a court-martial conviction for conduct 'to the prejudice of good order and military discipline' in violation of the Articles of War. The Court recognized the role of 'unwritten law or usage' in giving meaning to the language of what is now Art. 134. In rejecting Swaim's argument that the evidence failed to establish an offense under the article, the Court said:\n'(T)his is the very matter that falls within the province of      courts-martial, and in respect to which their conclusions      cannot be controlled or reviewed by the civil courts. As was      said in Smith v. Whitney, 116 U.S. 178 (6 S.Ct. 570, 576, 29      L.Ed. 601), 'Of questions not depending upon the construction      of the statutes, but upon unwritten military law or usage,      within the jurisdiction of courts-martial, military or naval      officers, from their training and experience in the service,      are more competent judges than the courts of common law.\" 165      U.S., at 562, 17 S.Ct., at 451.\nThe Court of Claims had observed that cases involving 'conduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline,' as opposed to conduct unbecoming an officer, 'are still further beyond the bounds of ordinary judicial judgment, for they are not measurable by our innate sense of right and wrong, of honor and dishonor, but must be gauged by an actual knowledge and experience of military life, its usages and duties.'20\nII\nThe differences noted by this settled line of authority, first between the military community and the civilian community, and second between military law and civilian law, continue in the present day under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. That Code cannot be equated to a civilian criminal code. It, and the various versions of the Articles of War which have preceded it, regulate aspects of the conduct of members of the military which in the civilian sphere are left unregulated. While a civilian criminal code carves out a relatively small segment of potential conduct and declares it criminal, the Uniform Code of Military Justice essays more varied regulation of a much larger segment of the activities of the more tightly knit military community. In civilian life there is no legal sanction\u2014civil or criminal\u2014for failure to behave as an officer and a gentleman; in the military world, Art. 133 imposes such a sanction on a commissioned officer. The Code likewise imposes other sanctions for conduct that in civilian life is not subject to criminal penalties: disrespect toward superior commissioned officers, Art. 89, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 889; cruelty toward, or oppression or maltreatment of subordinates, Art. 93, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 893; negligent damaging, destruction, or wrongful disposition of military property of the United States, Art. 108, 10 U.S.C. 908; improper hazarding of a vessel, Art. 110, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 910; drunkenness on duty, Art. 112, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 912; and malingering, Art. 115, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 915.\nBut the other side of the coin is that the penalties provided in the Code vary from death and substantial penal confinement at one extreme to forms of administrative discipline which are below the threshold of what would normally be considered a criminal sanction at the other. Though all of the offenses described in the Code are punishable 'as a court-martial may direct,' and the accused may demand a trial by court-martial,21 Art. 15 of the Code also provides for the imposition of nonjudicial 'disciplinary punishments' for minor offenses without the intervention of a court-martial. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815. The punishments imposable under that article are of a limited nature. With respect to officers, punishment may encompass suspension of duty, arrest in quarters for not more than 30 days, restriction for not more than 60 days, and forfeiture of pay for a limited period of time. In the case of enlisted men, such punishment may additionally include, among other things, reduction to the next inferior pay grade, extra fatigue duty, and correctional custody for not more than seven consecutive days. Thus, while legal proceedings actually brought before a court-martial are prosecuted in the name of the Government, and the accused has the right to demand that he be proceeded against in this manner before any sanctions may be imposed upon him, a range of minor sanctions for lesser infractions are often imposed administratively. Forfeiture of pay, reduction in rank, and even dismissal from the service bring to mind the law of labor-management relations as much as the civilian criminal law.\nIn short, the Uniform Code of Military Justice regulates a far broader range of the conduct of military personnel than a typical state criminal code regulates of the conduct of civilians; but at the same time the enforcement of that Code in the area of minor offenses is often by sanctions which are more akin to administrative or civil sanctions than to civilian criminal ones.\nThe availability of these lesser sanctions is not surprising in view of the different relationship of the Government to members of the military. It is not only that of lawgiver to citizen, but also that of employer to employee. Indeed, unlike the civilian situation, the Government is often employer, landlord, provisioner, and lawgiver rolled into one. That relationship also reflects the different purposes of the two communities. As we observed in In re Grimley, 137 U.S., at 153, 11 S.Ct., at 55, the military 'is the executive arm' whose 'law is that of obedience.' While members of the military community enjoy many of the same rights and bear many of the same burdens as do members of the civilian community, within the military community there is simply not the same autonomy as there is in the larger civilian community. The military establishment is subject to the control of the civilian Commander in Chief and the civilian departmental heads under him, and its function is to carry out the policies made by those civilian superiors.\nPerhaps because of the broader sweep of the Uniform Code, the military makes an effort to advise its personnel of the contents of the Uniform Code, rather than depending on the ancient doctrine that everyone is presumed to know the law. Article 137 of the Uniform Code 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 937, requires that the provisions of the Code be 'carefully explained to each enlisted member at the time of his entrance on active duty, or within six days thereafter' and that they be 'explained again after he has completed six months of active duty . . ..' Thus the numerically largest component of the services, the enlisted personnel, who might be expected to be a good deal less familiar with the Uniform Code than commissioned officers, are required by its terms to receive instructions in its provisions. Article 137 further provides that a complete text of the Code and of the regulations prescribed by the President 'shall be made available to any person on active duty, upon his request, for his personal examination.'\nWith these very significant differences between military law and civilian law and between the military community and the civilian community in mind, we turn to appellee's challenges to the constitutionality of Arts. 133 and 134.\nIII\nAppellee urges that both Art. 133 and Art. 134 (the general article) are 'void for vagueness' under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and overbroad in violation of the First Amendment. We have recently said of the vagueness doctrine:\n'The doctrine incorporates notions of fair notice or warning.      Moreover, it requires legislatures to set reasonably clear      guidelines for law enforcement officials and triers of fact      in order to prevent 'arbitrary and discriminatory      enforcement.' Where a statute's literal scope, unaided by a      narrowing state court interpretation, is capable of reaching      expression sheltered by the First Amendment, the doctrine      demands a greater degree of specificity than in other      contexts.' Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, 572\u2014573, 94 S.Ct.      1242, 1247, 39 L.Ed.2d 605 (1974).\nEach of these articles has been construed by the United States Court of Military Appeals or by other military authorities in such a manner as to at least partially narrow its otherwise broad scope.\nThe United States Court of Military Appeals has stated that Art. 134 must be judged 'not in vacuo, but in the context in which the years have placed it,' United States v. Frantz, 2 U.S.C.M.A. 161, 163, 7 C.M.R. 37, 39 (1953). Article 134 does not mke 'every irregular, mischievous, or improper act a court-martial offense,' United States v. Sadinsky, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 563, 565, 34 C.M.R. 343, 345 (1964), but its reach is limited to conduct that is \"directly and palpably\u2014as distinguished from indirectly and remotely\u2014prejudicial to good order and discipline.\" Ibid; United States v. Holiday, 4 U.S.C.M.A. 454, 456, 16 C.M.R. 28, 30 (1954). It applies only to calls for active opposition to the military policy of the United States, United States v. Priest, 21 U.S.C.M.A. 564, 45 C.M.R. 338 (1972), and does not reach all '(d)isagreement with, or objection to, a policy of the Government.' United States v. Harvey, 19 U.S.C.M.A. 539, 544, 42 C.M.R. 141, 146 (1971).\nThe Manual for Courts-Martial restates these limitations on the scope of Art. 134.22 It goes on to say that '(c)ertain disloyal statements by military personnel' may be punishable under Art. 134. 'Examples are utterances designed to promote disloyalty or disaffection among troops, as praising the enemy, attacking the war aims of the United States, or denouncing our form of government.'23 Extensive additional interpretative materials are contained in the portions of the Manual devoted to Art. 134, which describe more than sixty illustrative offenses.\nThe Court of Military Appeals has likewise limited the scope of Art. 133. Quoting from W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents (2d ed. 1920), 711\u2014712, that court has stated:\n'\". . . To constitute therefore the conduct here denounced,      the act which forms the basis of the charge must have a      double significance and effect.\nThough it need not amount to a crime, it must offend so      seriously against law, justice, morality or decorum as to      expose to disgrace, socially or as a man, the offender, and      at the same time must be of such a nature or committed under      such circumstances as to bring dishonor or disrepute upon the      military profession which he represents.'\" United States v.      Howe, 17 U.S.C.M.A. 165, 177\u2014178, 37 C.M.R. 429, 441\u2014442      (1967).\nThe effect of these constructions of Arts. 133 and 134 by the Court of Military Appeals and by other military authorities has been twofold: It has narrowed the very broad reach of the literal language of the articles, and at the same time has supplied considerable specificity by way of examples of the conduct which they cover. It would be idle to pretend that there are not areas within the general confines of the articles' language which have been left vague despite these narrowing constructions. But even though sizable areas of uncertainty as to the coverage of the articles may remain after their official interpretation by authoritative military sources, further content may be supplied even in these areas by less formalized custom and usage. Dynes v. Hoover, 20 How. 65, 15 L.Ed. 838 (1857). And there also cannot be the slightest doubt under the military precedents that there is a substantial range of conduct to which both articles clearly apply without vagueness or imprecision. It is within that range that appellee's conduct squarely falls, as the Court of Appeals recognized:\n'Neither are we unmindful that the Manual for Courts-Martial      offers as an example of an offense under Article 134,      'praising the enemy, attacking the war aims of the United      States, or denouncing our form of government.' With the      possible exception of the statement that 'Special Forces      personnel are liars and thieves and killers of peasants and murderers of women      and children,' it would appear that each statement for which      (Levy) was court-martialed could fall within the example      given in the Manual.' 478 F.2d, at 794.\nThe Court of Appeals went on to hold, however, that even though Levy's own conduct was clearly prohibited, the void-for-vagueness doctrine conferred standing upon him to challenge the imprecision of the language of the articles as they might be applied to hypothetical situations outside the considerable area within which their applicability was similarly clear.\nWe disagree with the Court of Appeals both in its approach to this question and in its resolution of it. This Court has on more than one occasion invalidated statutes under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment because they contained no standard whatever by which criminality could be ascertained, and the doctrine of these cases has subsequently acquired the shorthand description of 'void for vagueness.' Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 59 S.Ct. 618, 83 L.Ed. 888 (1939); Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 68 S.Ct. 665, 92 L.Ed. 840 (1948). In these cases, the criminal provision is vague 'not in the sense that it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard, but rather in the sense that no standard of conduct is specified at all.' Coates v. City of Cincinnati, 402 U.S. 611, 614, 91 S.Ct. 1686, 1688, 29 L.Ed.2d 214 (1971).\nBut the Court of Appeals found in this case, and we agree, that Arts. 133 and 134 are subject to no such sweeping condemnation. Levy had fair notice from the language of each article that the particular conduct which he engaged in was punishable. This is a case, then, of the type adverted to in Smith v. Goguen, in which the statutes 'by their terms or as authoritatively construed apply without question to certain activities, but whose application to other behavior is uncertain.' Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S., at 578, 94 S.Ct., at 1249. The result of the Court of Appeals' conclusion that Levy had standing to challenge the vagueness of these articles as they might be hypothetically applied to the conduct of others, even though he was squarely within their prohibitions, may stem from a blending of the doctrine of vagueness with the doctrine of overbreadth, but we do not believe it is supported by prior decisions of this Court.\nWe have noted in Smith v. Goguen, id., at 573, 94 S.Ct., at 1247 that more precision in drafting may be required because of the vagueness doctrine in the case of regulation of expression. For the reasons which differentiate military society from civilian society, we think Congress is permitted to legislate both with greater breadth and with greater flexibility when prescribing the rules by which the former shall be governed than it is when prescribing rules for the latter. But each of these differentiations relates to how strict a test of vagueness shall be applied in judging a particular criminal statute. None of them suggests that one who has received fair warning of the criminality of his own conduct from the statute in question is nonetheless entitled to attack it because the language would not give similar fair warning with respect to other conduct which might be within its broad and literal ambit. One to whose conduct a statute clearly applies may not successfully challenge it for vagueness.\nBecause of the factors differentiating military society from civilian society, we hold that the proper standard of review for a vagueness challenge to the articles of the Code is the standard which applies to criminal statutes regulating economic affairs. Clearly, that standard is met here, for as the Court stated in United States v. National Dairy Products Corp., 372 U.S. 29, 32\u201433, 83 S.Ct. 594, 597, 9 L.Ed.2d 561 (1963):\n'The strong presumptive validity that attaches to an Act of      Congress has led this Court to hold many times that statutes      are not automatically invalidated as vague simply because      difficulty is found in determining whether certain marginal      offenses fall within their language. E.g., Jordan v. De      George, 341 U.S. 223, 231, (71 S.Ct. 703, 707, 95 L.Ed. 886)      (1951), and United States v. Petrillo, 332 U.S. 1, 7 (67      S.Ct. 1538, 1541, 91 L.Ed. 1877) (1947). Indeed, we have      consistently sought an interpretation which supports the      constitutionality of legislation. E.g., United States v.      Rumely, 345 U.S. 41, 47 (73 S.Ct. 543, 546, 97 L.Ed. 770)      (1953); Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 62 (52 S.Ct. 285,      296, 76 L.Ed. 598) (1932); see Screws v. United States, 325      U.S. 91 (65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495) (1945).\n'Void for vagueness simply means that criminal responsibility      should not attach where one could not reasonably understand      that his contemplated conduct is proscribed. United States v.      Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 617, 74 S.Ct. 808, 98 L.Ed. 989      (1954). In determining the sufficiency of the notice a      statute must of necessity be examined in the light of the      conduct with which a defendant is charged. Robinson v. United      States, 324 U.S. 282, 65 S.Ct. 666, 89 L.Ed. 944 (1945).'\nSince appellee could have had no reasonable doubt that his public statements urging Negro enlisted men not to go to Vietnam if ordered to do so were both 'unbecoming an officer and a gentleman,' and 'to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces,' in violation of the provisions of Art. 133 and Art. 134, respectively, his challenge to them as unconstitutionally vague under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment must fail.\nWe likewise reject appellee's contention that Arts. 133 and 134 are facially invalid because of their 'overbreadth.' In Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U.S., at 520\u2014521, 92 S.Ct., at 1105, the Court said:\n'It matters not that the words appellee used might have been      constitutionally prohibited under a narrowly and precisely      drawn statute. At least when statutes regulate or proscribe      speech and when 'no readily apparent construction suggests      itself as a vehicle for rehabilitating the statutes in a      single prosecution,' Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 491      (85 S.Ct. 1116, 1123, 14 L.Ed.2d 22) (1965), the transcendent      value to all society of constitutionally protected expression      is deemed to justify allowing 'attacks on overly broad      statutes with no requirement that the person making the      attack demonstrate that his own conduct could not be      regulated by a statute drawn with the requisite narrow      specificity' . . ..'\nWhile the members of the military are not excluded from the protection granted by the First Amendment, the different character of the military community and of the military mission requires a different application of those protections. The fundamental necessity for obedience, and the consequent necessity for imposition of discipline, may render permissible within the military that which would be constitutionally impermissible outside it. Doctrines of First Amendment overbreadth asserted in support of challenges to imprecise language like that contained in Arts. 133 and 134 are not exempt from the operation of these principles. The United States Court of Military Appeals has sensibly expounded the reason for this different application of First Amendment doctrines in its opinion in United States v. Priest, 21 U.S.C.M.A., at 570, 45 C.M.R., at 344:\n'In the armed forces some restrictions exist for reasons that      have no counterpart in the civilian community. Disrespectful and contemptuous speech, even      advocacy of violent change, is tolerable in the civilian      community, for it does not directly affect the capacity of      the Government to discharge its responsibilities unless it      both is directed to inciting imminent lawless action and is      likely to produce such action. Brandenburg v. Ohio (395 U.S.      444, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969)). In military life,      however, other considerations must be weighed. The armed      forces depend on a command structure that at times must      commit men to combat, not only hazarding their lives but      ultimately involving the security of the Nation itself.      Speech that is protected in the civil population may      nonetheless undermine the effectiveness of response to      command. If it does, it is constitutionally unprotected.      United States v. Gray (20 U.S.C.M.A. 63, 42 C.M.R. 255      (1970)).'\nIn Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 610, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2915, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973), we said that '(e)mbedded in the traditional rules governing constitutional adjudication is the principle that a person to whom a statute may constitutionally be applied will not be heard to challenge that statute on the ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others, in other situations not before the Court.' We further commented in that case that '(i)n the past, the Court has recognized some limited exceptions to these principles, but only because of the most 'weighty countervailing policies.\" Id., at 611, 93 S.Ct. at 2915. One of those exceptions 'has been carved out in the area of the First Amendment.' Ibid. In the First Amendment context attacks have been permitted 'on overly broad statutes with no requirement that the person making the attack demonstrate that his own conduct could not be regulated by a statute drawn with the requisite narrow specificity,' Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 486, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 1121, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965).\nThis Court has, however, repeatedly expressed its reluctance to strike down a statute on its face where there were a substantial number of situations to which it might be validly applied. Thus, even if there are marginal applications in which a statute would infringe on First Amendment values, facial invalidation is inappropriate if the 'remainder of the statute . . . covers a whole range of easily identifiable and constitutionally proscribable . . . conduct . . ..' United States Civil Service Comm'n v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 580\u2014581, 93 S.Ct. 2880, 2898, 37 L.Ed.2d 796 (1973). And the Court recognized in Broadrick, supra, that 'where conduct and not merely speech is involved' the overbreadth must 'not only be real, bur substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.' 413 U.S., at 615, 93 S.Ct., at 2918. Here, as the Manual makes clear, both Art. 133 and Art. 134 do prohibit a 'whole range of easily identifiable and constitutionally proscribable . . . conduct.'\nBoth Broadrick and Letter Carriers involved basically noncriminal sanctions imposed on federal and state employees who were otherwise civilians. The Uniform Code of Military Justice applies a series of sanctions, varying from severe criminal penalties to administratively imposed minor sanctions, upon members of the military. However, for the reasons dictating a different application of First Amendment principles in the military context described above, we think that the \"weighty countervailing policies,\" Broadrick, supra, 413 U.S., at 611, 93 S.Ct., at 2915, which permit the extension of standing in First Amendment cases involving civilian society, must be accorded a good deal less weight in the military context.\nThere is a wide range of the conduct of military personnel to which Arts. 133 and 134 may be applied without infringement of the First Amendment. While there may lurk at the fringes of the articles, even in the light of their narrowing construction by the United States Court of Military Appeals, some possibility that conduct which would be ultimately held to be protected by the First Amendment could be included within their prohibition, we deem this insufficient to invalidate either of them at the behest of appellee. His conduct, that of a commissioned officer publicly urging enlisted personnel to refuse to obey orders which might send them into combat, was unprotected under the most expansive notions of the First Amendment. Articles 133 and 134 may constitutionally prohibit that conduct and a sufficiently large number of similar or related types of conduct so as to preclude their invalidation for overbreadth.\nIV\nAppellee urges that should we disagree with the Court of Appeals as to the constitutionality of Arts. 133 and 134, we should nonetheless affirm its judgment by invalidating his conviction under Art. 90. He contends that to carry out the hospital commandant's order to train aide men in dermatology would have constituted participation in a war crime, and that the commandant gave the order in question, knowing that it would be disobeyed, for the sole purpose of increasing the punishment which could be imposed upon appellee. The Court of Appeals observed that each of these defenses was recognized under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, but had been resolved against appellee on a factual basis by the court-martial which convicted him. The court went on to say that:\n'In isolation, these factual determinations adverse to      appellant under an admittedly valid article are not of      constitutional significance and resultantly, are beyond our      scope of review.' 478 F.2d, at 797.\nSee Whelchel v. McDonald, 340 U.S. 122, 71 S.Ct. 146, 95 L.Ed. 141 (1950). We agree with the Court of Appeals.\nAppellee in his brief here mounts a number of alternative attacks on the sentence imposed by the court-martial, attacks which were not treated by the Court of Appeals in its opinion in this case. To the extent that these points were properly presented to the District Court and preserved on appeal to the Court of Appeals, and to the extent that they are open on federal habeas corpus review of court-martial convictions under Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137, 73 S.Ct. 1045, 97 L.Ed. 1508 (1953), we believe they should be addressed by the Court of Appeals in the first instance.\nReversed.\nMr. Justice MARSHALL took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring.\n\n\nI\n wholly concur in the Court's opinion. I write only to state what for me is a crucial difference between the majority and dissenting views in this case. My Brother STEWART compolains that men of common intelligence must necessarily speculate as to what 'conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman' or conduct to the 'prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces' or conduct 'of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces' really means. He implies that the average soldier or sailor would not reasonably expect, under the general articles, to suffer military reprimand or punishment for engaging in sexual acts with a chicken, or window peeping in a trailer park, or cheating while calling bingo numbers. Post, at 779. He argues that 'times have surely changed' and that the articles are 'so vague and uncertain as to be incomprehensible to the servicemen who are to be governed by them.' Post, at 781, 788\nThese assertions are, of course, no less judicial fantasy than that which the dissent charges the majority of indulging. In actuality, what is at issue here are concepts of 'right' and 'wrong' and whether the civil law can accommodate, in special circumstances, a system of law which expects more of the individual in the context of a broader variety of relationships than one finds in civilian life.\nIn my judgment, times have not changed in the area of moral precepts. Fundamental concepts of right and wrong are the same now as they were under the Articles of the Earl of Essex (1642), or the British Articles of War of 1765, or the American Articles of War of 1775, or during the long line of precedents of this and other courts upholding the general articles. And, however unfortunate it may be, it is still necessary to maintain a disciplined and obedient fighting force.\n\n\nA\n noted commentator, Professor Bishop of Yale, has recently stated that '(a) lmost all of the acts actually charged under (Articles 133 and 134), notably drug offenses, are of a sort which ordinary soldiers know, or should know, to be punishible.' J. Bishop, Justice Under Fire 87\u201488 (1974). I agree. The subtle airs that govern the command relationship are not always capable of specification. The general articles are essential not only to punish patently criminal conduct, but also to foster an orderly and dutiful fighting force. One need only read the history of the permissive\u2014and shortlived\u2014regime of the Soviet Army in the early days of the Russian Revolution to know that command indulgence of an undisciplined rank and file can decimate a fighting force. Moreover, the fearful specter of arbitrary enforcement of the articles, the engine of the dissent, is disabled, in my view, by the elaborate system of military justice that Congress has provided to servicemen, and by the self-evident, and self-selective, factor that commanders who are arbitrary with their charges will not produce the efficient and effective military organization this county needs and demands for its defense\nIn Fletcher v. United States, 26 Ct.Cl. 541 (1891), the Court of Claims reviewed a court-martial finding that a Captain Fletcher was guilty of conduct unbecoming an officer in having, \"with intent to defraud, failed, neglected, and refused to pay (one W.) the amount due him, though repeatedly requested to do so.\" The court found this charged offense to come within the article. The sentiments expressed by Judge Nott, writing for the court in that case, are just as applicable to the case we decide today.\n'It must be confessed that, in the affairs of civil life and      under the rules and principles of municipal law, what we      ordinarily know as fraud relates to the obtaining of a man's      money, and not to refusing to pay it back. It is hard for the      trained lawyer to conceive of an indictment or declaration      which should allege that the defendant defrauded A or B by      refusing to return to him the money which he had borrowed      from him. Our legal training, the legal habit of mind, as it      is termed, inclines us to dissociate punishment from acts      which the law does not define as offenses. As one of our      greatest writers of fiction puts it, with metaphysical      fitness and accurate sarcasm, as she describes one of her      legal characters, 'His moral horizon was limited by the civil      code of Tennessee.' That it is a fraud to obtain a man's      money by dishonest representations, but not a fraud to keep      it afterwards by any amount of lying and deceit, is a      distinction of statutory tracing. The gambler who throws away      other people's money and the spendthrift who uses it in      luxurious living instead of paying it back, cheat and defraud      their creditors as effectually as the knaves and sharpers who drift within the meshes of the criminal law. We learnt as law      students in Blackstone that there are things which are malum      in se and, in addition to them, things which are merely malum      prohibitum; but unhappilly in the affairs of real life we      find that there are many things which are malum in se without      likewise being malum prohibitum. In military life there is a      higher code termed honor, which holds its society to stricter      accountability; and it is not desirable that the standard of      the Army shall come down to the requirements of a criminal      code.' Id., at 562\u2014563.\nRelativistic notions of right and wrong, or situation ethics, as some call it, have achieved in recent times a disturbingly high level of prominence in this country, both in the guise of law reform, and as a justification of conduct that persons would normally eschew as immoral and even illegal. The truth is that the moral horizons of the American people are not footloose, or limited solely by 'the civil code of Tennessee.' The law should, in appropriate circumstances, be flexible enough to recognize the moral dimension of man and his instincts concerning that which is honorable, decent, and right.*\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.\nCongress by Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 14, has power 'To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.'\nArticles 1331 and 1342 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 933 and 934, at issue in this case, trace their legitimacy to that power.\nSo far as I can discover the only express exemption of a person in the Armed Services from the protection of the Bill of Rights is that contained in the Fifth Amendment which dispenses with the need for 'a presentment or indictment' of a grand jury 'in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger.'\nBy practice and by construction the words 'all criminal prosecutions' in the Sixth Amendment do not necessarily cover all military trials. One result is that the guarantee of the Sixth Amendment of trial 'by an impartial jury' is not applicable to military trials.3 But Judge Ferguson in United States v. Tempia, 16 U.S.C.M.A. 629, 37 C.M.R. 249, properly said:4\n'(B)oth the Supreme Court and this Court itself are satisfied      as to the applicability of constitutional safeguards to      military trials, except insofar as they are made inapplicable      either expressly or by necessary implication. The Government,      therefore, is correct in conceding the point, and the Judge      Advocate General, United States Navy, as amicus curiae, is      incorrect in his contrary conclusion. Indeed, as to the      latter, it would appear from the authorities on which he      relies that the military courts applied what we now know as      the constitutional protection against self-incrimination in      trials prior to and contemporaneous with the adoption of the      Constitution. Hence, we find Major Andre being extended the      privilege at his court-martial in 1780. Wigmore, Evidence, 3d ed, \u00a7 2251. The same reference was made in the      trial of Commodore James Barron in 1808. Proceedings of the      General Court Martial Convened for the Trial of Commodore      James Barron (1822), page 98. And, the Articles of War of      1776, as amended May 31, 1786, provided for objection by the      judge advocate to any question put to the accused, the answer      to which might tend to incriminate him. See Winthrop's      Military Law and Precedents, 2d ed, 1920 Reprint, pages 196,      972.' 16 U.S.C.M.A., at 634, 37 C.M.R., at 254.\nBut the cases we have had so far have concerned only the nature of the tribunal which may try a person and\/or the procedure to be followed.5 This is the first case that presents to us a question of what protection, if any, the First Amendment gives people in the Armed Services:\nOn its face there are no exceptions\u2014no preferred classes for whose benefit the First Amendment extends, no exempt classes.\nThe military by tradition and by necessity demands discipline; and those necessities require obedience in training and in action. A command is speech brigaded with action, and permissible commands may not be disobeyed. There may be a borderland or penumbra that in time can be established by litigated cases.\n\n\nI\n cannot imagine, however, that Congress would think it had the power to authorize the military to curtail the reading list of books, plays, poems, periodicals, papers, and the like which a person in the Armed Services may read. Nor can I believe Congress would assume authority to empower the military to suppress conversations at a bar, ban discussions of public affairs, prevent enlisted men or women or draftees from meeting in discussion groups at times and places and for such periods of time that do not interfere with the performance of military duties\nCongress has taken no such step here. By Art. 133 it has allowed punishment for 'conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.' In our society where diversities are supposed to flourish it never could be 'unbecoming' to express one's views, even on the most controversial public issue.\nArticle 134 covers only 'all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces, all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.'\nCaptain Levy, the appellee in the present case, was not convicted under Arts. 133 and 134 for failure to give the required medical instructions. But as he walked through the facilities and did his work, or met with students, he spoke of his views of the 'war' in Vietnam. Thus he said:\n'The United States is wrong in being involved in the Viet Nam      War. I would refuse to go to Viet Nam if ordered to do so. I      don't see why any colored soldier would go to Viet Nam; they      should refuse to go to Viet Nam and if sent should refuse to      fight because they are discriminated against and denied their      freedom in the United States, and they are sacrificed and      discriminated against in Viet Nam by being given all the      hazardous duty and they are suffering the majority of      casualties. If I were a colored soldier I would refuse to go to Viet Nam and if I      were a colored soldier and were sent I would refuse to fight.      Special Forces personnel are liars and thieves and killers of      peasants and murderers of women and children.'\nThose ideas affronted some of his superiors. The military, of course, tends to produce homogenized individuals who think\u2014as well as march\u2014in unison. In United States v. Blevens, 5 U.S.C.M.A. 480, 18 C.M.R. 104, the Court of Military Appeals upheld the court-martial conviction of a serviceman who had 'affiliated' himself with a Communist organization in Germany. The serviceman argued that there was no allegation that he possessed any intent to overthrow the Government by force, so that the Smith Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2385, would not reach his conduct. The Court of Military Appeals affirmed on the theory that his affiliation, nonetheless, brought 'discredit' on the Armed Forces within the meaning of Art. 134:\n'Most important to the case is the Government's contention      that regardless of any deficiencies under the Smith Act, the      specification properly alleges, and the evidence adequately      establishes, conduct to the discredit of the armed forces, in      violation of Article 134.\n'Membership by a school teacher in an organization advocating      the violent disestablishment of the United States Government      has been regarded as conduct requiring dismissal. Adler v.      Board of Education, 342 U.S. 485 (72 S.Ct. 380, 96 L.Ed.      517). It seems to us that such membership is even more      profoundly evil in the case of a person in the military      establishment. True, affiliation implies something less than      membership (Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135, 143 (65 S.Ct.      1443, 89 L.Ed. 2103)), but the supreme duty of the military is the protection and security      of the government and of the people. Hence, aside from a      specific intent on the part of the accused to overthrow the      government by violence, the conduct alleged is definitely      discrediting to the armed forces.' 5 U.S.C.M.A., at 483\u2014484,      18 C.M.R., at 107\u2014108.\nThe limitations on expressions of opinion by members of the military continue to date. During the Vietnam war, a second lieutenant in the reserves, off duty, out of uniform, and off base near a local university, carried a placard in an antiwar demonstration which said 'END JOHNSON'S FACIST (sic) AGGRESSION IN VIET NAM.' He was convicted by a court-martial under Art. 88 for using 'contemptuous words' against the President and under Art. 133 for 'conduct unbecoming an officer.' The Court of Military Appeals affirmed, theorizing that suppression of such speech was essential to prevent a military 'man on a white horse' from challenging 'civilian control of the military.' United States v. Howe, 17 U.S.C.M.A. 165, 175, 37 C.M.R. 429, 439. The Court did not attempt to weigh the likelihood that Howe, a reserve second lieutenant engaging in a single off-base expression of opinion on the most burning political issue of the day, could ever be such a 'man on a white horse.' Indeed, such considerations were irrelevant:\n'True, petitioner is a reserve officer, rather than a      professional officer, but during the time he serves on active      duty he is, and must be, controlled by the provisions of      military law. In this instance, military restrictions fall      upon a reluctant 'summer soldier'; but at another time, and      differing circumstances, the ancient and wise provisions      insuring civilian control of the military will restrict the      'man on a white horse.\" Ibid.\nSee generally Sherman, The Military Courts And Servicemen's First Amendment Rights, 22 Hastings L.J. 325 (1971.)\nThe power to draft an army includes, of course, the power to curtail considerably the 'liberty' of the people who make it up. But Congress in these articles has not undertaken to cross the forbidden First Amendment line. Making a speech or comment on one of the most important and controversial public issues of the past two decades cannot by any stretch of dictionary meaning be included in 'disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces.' Nor can what Captain Levy said possibly be 'conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.' He was uttering his own belief\u2014an article of faith that he sincerely held. This was no mere ploy to perform a 'subversive' act. Many others who loved their country shared his views. They were not saboteurs. Uttering one's beliefs is sacrosanct under the First Amendment.6 Punishing the utterances is an 'abridgment' of speech in the constitutional sense.\nMr. Justice STEWART, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice BRENNAN join, dissenting.\nArticle 133 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 933, makes it a criminal offense to engage in 'conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.'1 Article 134, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934 makes criminal 'all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces' and 'all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.'2 The Court today, reversing a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeals, upholds the constitutionality of these statutes. I find it hard to imagine criminal statutes more patently unconstitutional than these vague and uncertain general articles, and I would, accordingly, affirm the judgment before us.\n\n\n*\n As many decisions of this Court make clear, vague statutes suffer from at least two fatal constitutional defects. First, by failing to provide fair notice of precisely what acts are forbidden, a vague statute 'violates the first essential of due process of law.' Connally v. Gen eral Construction Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 127, 70 L.Ed. 322. As the Court put the matter in Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453, 59 S.Ct. 618, 619, 83 L.Ed. 888: 'No one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes. All are entitled to be informed as to what the State commands or forbids.' 'Words which are vague and fluid . . . may be as much of a trap for the innocent as the ancient laws of Caligula.' United States v. Cardiff, 344 U.S. 174, 176, 73 S.Ct. 189, 190, 97 L.Ed. 2003\nSecondly, vague statutes offend due process by failing to provide explicit standards for those who enforce them thus allowing discriminatory and arbitrary enforcement. Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 165\u2014171, 92 S.Ct. 839, 845 848, 31 L.Ed.2d 110. 'A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis . . ..' Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108\u2014109, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2299, 33 L.Ed.2d 222.4 The absence of specificity in a criminal statute invites abuse on the part of prosecuting officials, who are left free to harass any individuals or groups who may be the object of official displeasure.5\nIt is plain that Arts. 133 and 134 are vague on their face; indeed, the opinion of the Court does not seriously contend to the contrary.6 Men of common intelligence\u2014including judges of both military and civilian courts\u2014must necessarily speculate as to what such terms as 'conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman' and 'conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces' really mean. In the past, this Court has held unconstitutional statutes penalizing 'misconduct,'7 conduct that was 'annoying,'8 'reprehensible,'9 or 'prejudicial to the best interests' of a city,10 and it is significant that military courts have resorted to several of these very terms in describing the sort of acts proscribed by Arts. 133 and 134.11\nFacially vague statutes may, of course, be saved from unconstitutionality by narrowing judicial construction. But I cannot conclude, as does the Court, ante, at 752\u2014755, that the facial vagueness of the general articles has been cured by the relevant opinions of either the Court of Military Appeals or any other military tribunal. In attempting to give meaning to the amorphous words of the statutes, the Court of Military Appeals has repeatedly turned to Winthrop's Military Law and Precedents, an 1886 treatise. That work describes 'conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman' in the following manner:\n'To constitute therefore the conduct here denounced, the act      which forms the basis of the charge must have a double      significance and effect. Though it need not amount to a      crime, it must offend so seriously against law, justice,      morality or decorum as to expose of disgrace, socially or as      a man, the offender, and at the same time must be of such a      nature or committed under such circumstances as to bring      dishonor or disrepute upon the military profession which he      represents.'12\nAs to the predecessor statute of Art. 134, Col. Winthrop read it as applicable to conduct whose prejudice to good order and discipline was 'reasonably direct and palpable,' as opposed to that conduct which is simply 'indirectly or remotely' prejudicial whatever that may mean.13 These passages, and the decisions of the Court of Military Appeals that adopt them verbatim, scarcely add any substantive content to the language of the general articles. At best, the limiting constructions referred to by the Court represent a valiant but unavailing effort to read some specificity into hopelessly vague laws. Winthrop's definitions may be slightly different in wording from Arts. 133 and 134, but they are not different in kind, for they suffer from the same vagueness as the statutes to which they refer.\nIf there be any doubt as to the absence of truly limiting constructions of the general articles, it is swiftly dispelled by even the most cursory review of convictions under them in the military courts. Article 133 has been recently employed to punish such widely disparate conduct as dishonorable failure to repay debts,14 selling whiskey at an unconscionable price to an enlisted man,15 cheating at cards,16 and having an extramarital affair.17 Article 134 has been given an even wider sweep, having been applied to sexual acts with a chicken,18 window peeping in a trailer park,19 and cheating while calling bingo numbers.20 Convictions such as these leave little doubt that '(a)n infinite variety of other conduct, limited only by the scope of a commander's creativity or spleen, can be made the subject of court-martial under these articles.' Sherman, The Civilianization of Military Law, 22 Maine L.Rev. 3, 80.\nIn short, the general articles are in practice as well as theory 'catch-alls,' designed to allow prosecutions for practically any conduct that may offend the sensibilities of a military commander.21 Not every prosecution of course, results in a conviction, and the military courts have sometimes overturned convictions when the conduct involved was so marginally related to military discipline as to offend even the loosest interpretations of the General Articles.22 But these circumstances can hardly be thought to validate the otherwise vague statutes. As the Court said in United States v. Reese, 92 U.S. 214, 221, 23 L.Ed. 563: 'It would certainly be dangerous if the legislature could set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained, and who should be set at large.' At best, the General Articles are just such a net, and suffer from all the vices that our previous decisions condemn.\nII\nPerhaps in recognition of the essential vagueness of the general articles, the Court today adopts several rather periphrastic approaches to the problem before us. Whatever the apparent vagueness of these statutes to us civilians, we are told, they are models of clarity to \"practical men in the navy and army.\" Ante, at 747, quoting from Dynes v. Hoover, 20 How. 65, 82, 15 L.Ed. 838. Moreover, the Court says, the appellee should have been well aware that his conduct fell within the proscriptions of the general articles, since the Manual for Courts-Martial gives specific content to these facially uncertain statutes. I believe that neither of these propositions can withstand analysis.\n\n\nA\n \nIt is true, of course, that a line of prior decisions of this Court, beginning with Dynes v. Hoover, supra, in 1858 and concluding with Carter v. McClaughry, 183 U.S. 365, 22 S.Ct. 181, 46 L.Ed. 236, in 1902, have upheld against constitutional attack the ancestors of today's general articles.23 With all respect for the principle of stare decisis, however, I believe that these decisions should be given no authoritative force in view of what is manifestly a vastly 'altered historic environment.' Mitchell v. W. T. Grant Co., 416 U.S. 600, 634\u2014635, 94 S.Ct. 1895, 1913, 40 L.Ed.2d 406 (dissenting opinion). See also id., at 627\u2014628, 94 S.Ct., at 1909\u20141910 (Powell, J., concurring).\nIt is obvious that the Army into which Dr. Levy entered was far different. It was part of a military\nIt might well have been true in 1858 or even 1902 that those in the Armed Services knew, through a combination of military custom and instinct, what sorts of acts fell within the purview of the general articles. But times have surely changed. Throughout much of this country's early history, the standing army and navy numbered in the hundreds. The cadre was small, professional, the voluntary. The military was a unique society, isolated from the mainstream of civilian life, and it is at least plausible to suppose that the volunteer in that era understood what conduct was prohibited by the general articles.24 establishment whose members numbered in the millions, a large percentage of whom were conscripts or draft-induced volunteers, with no prior military experience and little expectation of remaining beyond their initial period of obligation.25 Levy was precisely such an individual, a draft-induced volunteer whose military indoctrination was minimal, at best.26 To presume that he and others like him who served during the Vietnam era were so imbued with the ancient traditions of the military as to comprehend the arcane meaning of the general articles is to engage in an act of judicial fantasy.27 In my view, we do a grave disservice to citizen soldiers in subjecting them to the uncertain regime of Arts. 133 and 134 simply because these provisions did not offend the sensibilities of the federal judiciary in a wholly different period of our history. In today's vastly 'altered historic environment,' the Dynes case and its progeny have become constitutional anachronisms, and I would retire them from active service.\n\n\nB\n \nThe Court suggests that the Manual for Courts-Martial provides some notice of what is proscribed by the general articles, through its Appendix containing 'Forms for Charges and Specifications.'28 These specimen charges, which consist of 'fill-in-the-blank' accusations covering various fact situations, do offer some indication of what conduct the drafters of the Manual perceived to fall within the prohibitions of Arts. 133 and 134. There are several reasons, however, why the form specifications cannot provide the sort of definitive interpretation of the general articles necessary to save these statutes from unconstitutionality.\nFor one thing, the specifications covering Arts. 133 and 134 are not exclusive; the military courts have repeatedly held conduct not listed in the Manual's Appendix as nonetheless violative of the general articles.29 Nor can it be said that the specifications contain any common threat or unifying theme that gives generic definition to the articles' vague words; the specimen charges in the Manual list such widely disparate conduct as kicking a public horse in the belly,30 subornation of perjury,31 and wrongful cohabitation32 as violative of Art. 134.33 Moreover, the list of offenses included in the Appendix is ever-expanding; the 1951 Manual contained 59 Art. 134 offenses,34 while the list had increased to 63 in 1969.35 In view of the nonexclusive and transient character of the specification list, a serviceman wishing to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law would simply find definitive guidance from the Manual Impossible.\nMore significantly, the fact that certain conduct is listed in the Manual is no guarantee that it is in violation of the general articles. The Court of Military Appeals has repeatedly emphasized that the sample specifications are only procedural guides and timesavers for military prosecutors beset by poor research facilities, and are not intended to create offenses under the general articles.36 Consequently, the court has on several occasions disapproved Art. 134 convictions, despite the fact that the precise conduct at issue was listed in the form specifications as falling under that article.37\nDespite all this, the Court indicates that Levy should have been aware that his conduct was violative of Art. 134, since one of the specimen charges relates to the making of statements 'disloyal to the United States.'38 That specification, and the brief reference to such conduct in the text of the Manual,39 is itself so vague and overbroad as to have been declared unconstitutional by one federal court. Stolte v. Laird, 353 F.Supp. 1392 (DC). But even if a consensus as to the meaning of the word 'disloyal' were readily attainable, I am less than confident that Dr. Levy's attacks upon our Vietnam policies could be accurately characterized by such an adjective. However, foreign to the military atmosphere of Fort Jackson, the words spoken by him represented a viewpoint shared by many American citizens. Whatever the accuracy of these views, I would be loath to impute 'disloyalty' to those who honestly held them. In short, I think it is clear that the form specification concerning disloyal statements cannot be said to have given Levy notice of the illegality of his conduct. The specimen charge is no better than the article that spawned it. It merely substitutes one set of subjective and amorphous phraseology for another.40\nIII\nWhat has been said above indicates my view that the general articles are unconstitutionally vague under the standards normally and repeatedly applied by this Court. The remaining question is whether, as the Court concludes, ante, at 756, the peculiar situation of the military requires application of a standard of judicial review more relaxed than that embodied in our prior decisions.\nIt is of course common ground that the military is a 'specialized community governed by a separate discipline from that of the civilian.' Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U.S. 83, 94, 73 S.Ct.534, 540, 97 L.Ed. 842. A number of serviceman's individual rights must necessarily be subordinated to the overriding military mission, and I have no doubt that the military may constitutionally prohibit conduct that is quite permissible in civilian life, such as questioning the command of a superior. But this only begins the inquiry. The question before us is not whether the military may adopt substantive rules different from those that govern civilian society, but whether the serviceman has the same right as his civilian counterpart to be informed as to precisely what conduct those rules proscribe before he can be criminally punished for violating them. More specifically, the issue is whether the vagueness of the general articles is required to serve a genuine military objective.\nThe Solicitor General suggests that a certain amount of vagueness in the general articles is necessary in order to maintain high standards of conduct in the military, since it is impossible to predict in advance every offense that might serve to affect morale or discredit the service. It seems to me that this argument was concisely and eloquently rebutted by Judge Aldisert in the Court of Appeals, 478 F.2d 772, 795 (CA 3):\n'(W)hat high standard of conduct is served by convicting an      individual of conduct he did not reasonable perceive to be      criminal? Is not the essence of high standards in the      military, first, knowing one's duty, and secondly, executing      it? And, in this regard, would not an even higher standard be served by      delineation of the various offenses under Article 134,      following by obedience to these standards?'\nIt may be that military necessity justifies the promulgation of substantive rules of law that are wholly foreign to civilian life, but I fail to perceive how any legitimate military goal is served by enshrouding these rules in language so vague and uncertain as to be incomprehensible to the servicemen who are to be governed by them.41 Indeed, I should suppose that vague laws, with their serious capacity for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, can in the end only hamper the military's objectives of high morale and esprit de corps.\nIn short, I think no case has been made for finding that there is any legitimate military necessity for perpetuation of the vague and amorphous general articles. In this regard, I am not alone. No less an authority than Kenneth J. Hodson, former Judge Advocate General of the Army and Chief Judge of the Army Court of Military Review, has recommended the abolition of Art. 134 because '(w)e don't really need it, and we can't defend our use of it in this modern world.' Hodson, The Manual for Courts-Martial\u20141984, 57 Military L.Rev. 1, 12.42 No different conclusion can be reached as to Art. 133. Both are anachronisms, whose legitimate military usefulness, if any, has long since disappeared.\nIt is perhaps appropriate to add a final word. I do not for one moment denigrate the importance of our inherited tradition that the commissioned officers of our military forces are expected to be men of honor, nor do I doubt the necessity that servicemen generally must be orderly and dutiful. An efficient and effective military organization depends in large part upon the character and quality of its personnel, particularly its leadership. The internal loyalty and mutual reliance indispensable to the ultimate effectiveness of any military organization can exist only among people who can be counted on to do their duty.\nIt is, therefore, not only legitimate but essential that in matters of promotion, retention, duty assignment, and internal discipline, evaluations must repeatedly be made of a serviceman's basic character as reflected in his deportment, whether he be an enlisted man or a commissioned officer. But we deal here with criminal statutes. And I cannot believe that such meaningless statutes as these can be used to send men to prison under a Constitution that guarantees due process of law.\n\n\n1\n See 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 454(j).\n\n\n2\n Article 90 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 890, provides:\n'Any person subject to this chapter who\u2014\n'(1) strikes his superior commissioned officer or draws or lifts up any weapon or offers any violence against him while he is in the execution of his office; or\n'(2) willfully disobeys a lawful command of his superior commissioned officer;\n'shall be punished, if the offense is committed in time of war, by death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct, and if the offense is committed at any other time, by such punishment, other than death, as a court-martial may direct.'\n\n\n3\n Article 133 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 933, provides:\n'Any commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman who is convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.'\n\n\n4\n Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934, provides:\n'Though not specifically mentioned in this chapter, all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces, all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces, and crimes and offenses not capital, of which persons subject to this chapter may be guilty, shall be taken cognizance of by a general, special, or summary court-martial, according to the nature and degree of the offense, and shall be punished at the discretion of that court.'\n\n\n5\n The specification under Art. 134 (Charge II) alleged in full:\n'In that Captain Howard B. Levy, U.S. Army, Headquarters and Headquartes Company, United States Army Hospital, Fort Jackson, South Carolina, did, at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, on or about the period February 1966 to December 1966, with design to promote disloyalty and disaffection among the troops, publicly utter the following statements to divers enlisted personnel at divers times: 'The United States is wrong in being involved in the Viet Nam War. I would refuse to go to Viet Nam if ordered to do so. I don't see why any colored soldier would go to Viet Nam; they should refuse to go to Viet Nam and if sent should refuse to fight because they are discriminated against and denied their freedom in the United States, and they are sacrificed and discriminated against in Viet Nam by being given all the hazardous duty and they are suffering the majority of casualties. If I were a colored soldier I would refuse to go to Viet Nam and if I were a colored soldier and were sent I would refuse to fight. Special Forces personnel are liars and thieves and killers of peasants and murderers of women and children,' or words to that effect, which statements were disloyal to the United States, to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces.'\n\n\n6\n The specification under Art. 133 (Additional Charge I) alleged tht appellee\n'did . . . at divers times during the period from on or about February 1966 to on or about December 1966 while in the performance of his duties at the United States Army Hospital, Fort Jackson, South Carolina, wrongfully and dishonorably make the following statements of the nature and to and in the presence and hearing of the persons as hereinafter more particularly described, to wit: (1) Intemperate, defamatory, provoking, and disloyal statements to special forces enlisted personnel present for training in the United States Army Hospital, Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and in the presence and hearing of other enlisted personnel, both patients and those performing duty under his immediate supervision and control and dependent patients as follows: 'I will not train special forces personnel because they are 'liars and thieves,' 'killers of peasants,' and 'murderers of women and children,\" or words to that effect; (2) Intemperate and disloyal statements to enlisted personnel, both patients and those performing duty under his immediate supervision and control as follows: 'I would refuse to go to Vietnam if ordered to do so. I do not see why any colored soldier would go to Vietnam. They should refuse to go to Vietnam; and, if sent, they should refuse to fight because they are discriminated against and denied their freedom in the United States and they are sacrificed and discriminated against in Vietnam by being given all the hazardous duty, and they are suffering the majority of casualties. If I were a colored soldier, I would refuse to go to Vietnam; and, if I were a colored soldier and if I were sent to Vietnam, I would refuse to fight', or words to that effect; (3) Intemperate, contemptuous, and disrespectful statements to enlisted personnel performing duty under his immediate supervision and control, as follows: 'The Hospital Commander has given me an order to train special forces personnel, which order I have refused and will not obey,' or words to that effect; (4) Intemperate, defamatory, provoking, and disloyal statements to special forces personnel in the presence and hearing of enlisted personnel performing duty under his immediate supervision and control, as follows: 'I hope when you get to Vietnam something happens to you and you are injured,' or words to that effect; all of which statements were made to persons who knew that the said Howard B. Levy was a commissioned officer in the active service of the United States Army.'\n\n\n7\n United States v.

Corcoran, 128 U.S.App.D.C. 388, 389 F.2d 929, application for stay denied, 387 U.S. 915, 87 S.Ct. 2026, 18 L.Ed.2d 968, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 960, 88 S.Ct. 337, 19 L.Ed.2d 369 (1967); Levy v.

In his motion to dismiss or affirm, appellee urged a lack of jurisdiction in this Court because the attorneys who filed and served the notice of appeal were not attorneys of record and because the attorney effecting service failed to comply with Rule 33, subd. 3(c) of this Court requiring persons not admitted to the Bar of this Court to prove service by affidavit, rather than by certificate. Appellee alternatively contended that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 was not intended to permit appeals from the courts of appeals, but only from the district courts. We postponed consideration of the jurisdictional question to the hearing on the merits. Appellee now renews his contentions that the asserted defects in appellants' filing of their\nnotice of appeal should be treated as a failure to file a timely notice of appeal, and that the appeal must accordingly be dismissed. See, e.g., Territo v. United States, 358 U.S. 279, 79 S.Ct. 312, 3 L.Ed.2d 298 (1959); Department of Banking v. Pink, 317 U.S. 264, 268, 63 S.Ct. 233, 235, 87 L.Ed. 254 (1942). He also urges that the question whether an appeal may be taken to this Court from the Court of Appeals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 presents a question of first impression.\nWe hold that 'any court of the United States,' as used in \u00a7 1252, includes the courts of appeals. The Reviser's Note for \u00a7 1252 states that the 'term 'any court of the United States' includes the courts of appeals . . ..' The definitional section of Title 28, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 451, provides: 'As used in this title: The term 'court of the United States' includes the Supreme Court of the United States, courts of appeals, district courts . . ..' Our reading of \u00a7 1252 is further supported by that section's legislative history. Section 1252 was originally enacted as \u00a7 2 of the Act of August 24, 1937, c. 754, 50 Stat. 751. Section 5 of that same Act defined 'any court of the United States' to include any 'circuit court of appeals.' We also find no merit in appellee's contention that the asserted defects in appellants' notice of appeal deprive this Court of jusisdiction. As appellants note, appellee makes no claim that he did not have actual notice of the filing of the notice of appeal. Assuming that there was technical noncompliance with Rule 33 of this Court for the reasons urged by appellee, that noncompliance does not deprive this Court of jurisdiction. Cf. Taglianetti v. United States, 394 U.S. 316 n. 1, 89 S.Ct. 1099, 22 L.Ed.2d 302 (1969); Heflin v. United States, 358 U.S. 415, 418 n. 7, 79 S.Ct. 451, 453, 3 L.Ed.2d 407 (1959).\n\n\n11\n Section XX, Art.

In fact, Levy was convicted under charges that he, while in the performance of his duties at the United States Army Hospital in Fort Jackson, South Carolina, told the enlisted personnel in his charge that he would not train Special Forces aide men 'because they are 'liars and thieves,' 'killers of peasants,' and 'murderers of women and children.\" He also stated, in the presence of patients and those performing duty under his immediate supervision, that he would refuse to go to Vietnam if ordered to do so and they should refuse to do so. Moreover, after being ordered to give dermatological training to aide men, he announced to his students that '(t)he Hospital Commander has given me an order to train special forces personnel, which order I have refused and will not obey.' Unless one is to blind one's eyes in utter worship of the First Amendment, it needs no explication that these disloyal statements and actions undertaken by an officer in the course of duty, are subject to sanction.\n\n\n1\n 'Any commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman who is convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.'\n\n\n2\n 'Though not specifically mentioned in this chapter, all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces, all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces, and crimes and offenses not capital, of which persons subject to this chapter may be guilty, shall be taken cognizance of by a general, special, or summary court-martial, according to the nature and degree of the offense, and shall be punished at the discretion of that court.'\n\n\n3\n O'Callahan v. Parker, 395 U.S. 258, 262, 89 S.Ct. 1683, 1685, 23 L.Ed. 291, stated:\n'If the case does not arise 'in the land or naval forces,' then the accused gets first, the benefit of an indictment by a grand jury and second, a trial by jury before a civilian court as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment and by Art. III, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution which provides in part:\n\"The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.\"\n\n\n4\n The Court of Military Appeals has held that the 'probable cause' aspect of the Fourth Amendment is applicable to military trials. See, e.g., United States v. Battista, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 70, 33 C.M.R. 282; United States v. Gebhart, 10 U.S.C.M.A. 606, 28 C.M.R. 172; United States v. Brown, 10 U.S.C.M.A. 482, 28 C.M.R. 48.\nIt has been held that the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment extends to military trials, see United States v. Culp, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 199, 216\u2014217, 219, 33 C.M.R. 411, 428\u2014429, 431 (opinions of Quinn, C.J., Ferguson, J.).\nThere are rulings also that freedom of speech protects, to some extent at least, those in the Armed Services.

Schwimmer, 279 U.S. 644, 654\u2014655, 49 S.Ct. 448, 451, 73 L.Ed. 889, need to be recalled:\n'(T)he whole examination of the applicant shows that she holds none of the now-dreaded creeds but thoroughly believes in organized government and prefers that of the United States to any other in the world. Surely it cannot show lack of attachment to the principles of the Constitution that she thinks that it can be improved. I suppose that most intelligent people think that it might be. Her particular improvement looking to the abolition of war seems to me not materially different in its bearing on this case from a wish to establish cabinet government as in England, or a single house, or one term of seven years for the President. To touch a more burning question, only a judge mad with partisanship would exclude because the applicant thought that the Eighteenth Amendment should be repealed.\n'Of course the fear is that if a war came the applicant would exert activities such as were dealt with in Schenck v. United States,\n249 U.S. 47 (39 S.Ct. 247, 63 L.Ed. 470). But that seems to me unfounded. Her position and motives are wholly different from those of Schenck. She is an optimist and states in strong and, I do not doubt, sincere words her belief that war will disappear and that the impending destiny of mankind is to unite in peaceful leagues. I do not share that optimism nor do I think that a philosophic view of the world would regard war as absurd. But most people who have known it regard it with horror, as a last resort, and even if not yet ready for cosmopolitan efforts would welcome any practicable combinations that would increase the power on the side of peace. The notion that the applicant's optimistic anticipations would make her a worse citizen is sufficiently answered by her examination, which seems to me a better argument for her admission than any that I can offer. Some of her answers might excite popular prejudice, but if there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the principle of free thought\u2014not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate. I think that we should adhere to that principle with regard to admission into, as well as to life within this country. And recurring to the opinion that bars this applicant's way, I would suggest that the Quakers have done their share to make the country what it is, that many citizens agree with the applicant's belief and that I had not supposed hitherto that we regretted our inability to expel them because they believe more than some of us do in the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount.'\nThat dissent by Holmes became the law when Schwimmer, supra, United States v. Macintosh, 283 U.S. 605, 51 S.Ct. 570, 75 L.Ed. 1302, and United States v. Bland, 283 U.S. 636, 51 S.Ct. 569, 75 L.Ed. 1319, were overruled by Girouard v. United States, 328 U.S. 61, 66 S.Ct. 826, 90 L.Ed. 1084.\n\n\n1\n Article 133 provides:\n'Any commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman who is convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.'\n\n\n2\n Article 134 provides:\n'Though not specifically mentioned in this chapter, all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces, all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces, and crimes and offenses not capital, of which persons subject to this chapter may be guilty, shall be taken cognizance of by a general, special, or summary court-martial, according to the nature and degree of the offense, and shall be punished at the discretion of that court.'\nThe clause in Art. 134 prohibiting all 'crimes and offenses not capital' applies only to crimes and offenses proscribed by Congress. See Manual for Courts-Martial 213(e) (1969) (hereinafter sometimes referred to as Manual). Cf. Grafton v. United States, 206 U.S. 333, 27 S.Ct. 749, 51 L.Ed. 1084. As such, this clause is simply assimilative, like 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, and is not the subject of the vagueness attack mounted by appellee on the balance of Art. 134. See generally Wiener, Are the General Military Articles Unconstitutionally Vague?, 54 A.B.A.J. 357, 358; Note, Taps for the Real Catch-22, 81 Yale L.J. 1518 n. 3.\nWhile only Art. 134 is expressly termed the 'general article,' Arts. 133 and 134 are commonly known as the 'general articles' and will be so referred to herein.\n\n\n3\n See also United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 617, 74 S.Ct. 808, 812, 98 L.Ed. 989:\n'The constitutional requirement of definiteness is violated by a criminal statute that fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute. The underlying principle is that no man shall be held criminally responsible for conduct which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.'\n\n\n4\n See also Smith v. Goguen, 145 U.S. 566, 575, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 1248:\n'Statutory language of such a standardless sweep allows policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal predilections. Legislatures may not so abdicate their responsibilities for setting the standards of the criminal law.'\n\n\n5\n This Court has repeatedly recognized that the dangers inherent in vague statutes are magnified where laws touch upon First Amendment freedoms. See, e.g., id., at 573, 94 S.Ct., at 1247; Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 109, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2299, 33 L.Ed.2d 222. In such areas, more precise statutory specificity is required, lest cautions citizens steer clear of rotected conduct in order to be certain of not violating the law. See generally Note, The Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine in the Supreme Court, 109 U.Pa.L.Rev. 67, 75\u201485.\n\n\n6\n Even one of the staunchest defenders of the general articles has recognized that:\n'It cannot be denied that there is language in the void-for-vagueness cases broad enough to condemn as unduly indefinite the prohibition in Article 133 against 'conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman' and the prohibitions in Article 134 against 'all disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces' and against 'all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.\" Wiener, supra, n. 2, at 363.\n\n\n7\n Giaccio v.

Texas, 343 U.S. 960, 72 S.Ct. 1002, 96 L.Ed. 1359. Other federal courts have similarly held unconstitutional statutes containing language such as 'reflect(s) discredit,' Flynn v. Giarrusso, 321 F.Supp. 1295 (E.D.La.); 'offensive,' Pritikin v. Thurman, 311 F.Supp. 1400 (S.D.Fla.); and 'immoral' or 'demoralizing,' Oestreich v.

Lee, 4 C.M.R. 185, 191 (ABR), petition for review denied, 1 U.S.C.M.A. 713, 4 C.M.R. 173 ('reprehensible conduct'); United States v. Rio Poon, 26 C.M.R. 830, 833 (CGBR) ('universally reprehended').

Giordano, 15 U.S.C.M.A. 163, 168, 35 C.M.R. 135, 140.\nSuch authoritative publications as The Officer's Guide do little better in defining 'conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman':\n'There are certain moral attributes which belong to the ideal officer and the gentleman, a lack of which is indicated by acts of dishonesty or unfair dealing, of indecency or indecorum, or of lawlessness, injustice, or cruelty. Not every one can be expected to meet ideal standards or to possess the attributes in the exact degree demanded by the standards of his own time; but there is a limit of tolerance below which the individual standards in these respects of an officer or cadet cannot fall within his being morally unfit to be an officer or cadet or to be considered a gentleman. This article contemplates such conduct by an officer or cadet which, taking all the circumstances into consideration, satisfactorily shows such moral unfitness.' R.

Legal and Legislative Basis, Manual for Courts-Martial United States 294 (1951). Admitting that the language of Art. 134 is 'vague,' the drafters state:\n'By judicial interpretation these 'vague words' have since been expanded from the narrow construction placed on them by their author to the point where they have been used as the legal justification to sustain convictions for practically any offense committed by one in the military service which is not either specifically denounced by some other article, or is not a crime or offense not capital or a disorder or neglect to the prejudice of good order and discipline.'

Instead, he came to Fort Jackson directly from civilian life. While at Fort Jackson, he received but 16 to 26 hours of military training, only a small portion of which was devoted to military justice.\n\n\n27\n The Court suggests, ante, at 751\u2014752, that some of the problems with the general articles may be ameliorated by the requirement of Art. 137, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 937, that the provisions of the Code be 'carefully explained to each enlisted member at the time of his entrance on active duty, or within six days thereafter,' and that they be 'explained again after he has completed six months of active duty.' Even assuming, arguendo, that it is possible to 'carefully explain' the general articles, I do not believe that Art. 137 cures the vagueness of the statutes. The record in this case indicates that Dr. Levy received only a very brief amount of instruction on military justice; presumably, only a fraction of that instruction was devoted to the general articles. See n. 26, supra. Moreover, Army regulations indicate that only 20 minutes of instruction at the initial military justice lesson for enlisted men is devoted to Arts. 71 through 134 of the UCMJ; 49 minutes of instruction on Arts. 107 through 134 is provided for at the six-month class. Department of the Army, Army Regulation 350\u2014212, Training, Military Justice, 2 June 1972; Army Subject Schedule No. 21\u201410, Military Justice (Enlisted Personnel Training), 24 June 1969. Obviously, only a portion of this total of 69 minutes can be set aside for instruction pertaining to the general articles. It would be myopic to pretend that such limited instruction on these amorphous criminal statutes provided military personnel with any genuine expertise on the subject, even assuming that anybody could ever acquire such expertise.\n\n\n28\n Manual, App. 6c.\n\n\n29\n See, e.g., United States v.

McCormick, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 26, 30 C.M.R. 26. In these and other cases, the Court of Military Appeals has indicated its belief that Congress did not and could not empower the President to promulgate substantive rules of law for the military. See also United States v. Barnes, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 567, 34 C.M.R. 347; United States v. Margelony, 14 U.S.C.M.A. 55, 33 C.M.R. 267. Cf. United States v. Acosta-Vargas, 13 U.S.C.M.A. 388, 32 C.M.R. 388. The question as to whether the Executive has such as inherent power was apparently left open by this Court in Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 38, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148, and it is not necessary to resolve it in this case. It is enough to note that the Court of Military Appeals has clearly held that inclusion of specific conduct in the Manual does not necessarily mean that it is violative of the general articles. Given that position of the highest military court, I can hardly conclude that a serviceman could ever receive authoritative notice from the form specifications as to the scope of the Articles.\n\n\n37\n See, e.g., United States v. McCormick, 12 U.S.C.M.A. 26, 30 C.M.R. 26; United States v. Waluski, 6 U.S.C.M.A. 724, 21 C.M.R. 46.\n\n\n38\n Manual, App. 6c, Spec. 139.\n\n\n39\n Id., 213f(5).\n\n\n40\n The Court also holds that even if the general articles might be considered vague as to some offenders, the appellee has no standing to raise such a claim, since he should have known that his conduct was forbidden. Ante, at 755\u2014757. To the extent that this conclusion rests on the Court's holdings that the general articles are given content through limiting judicial constructions, military custom, or the Manual for Courts-Martial, I have indicated above my disagreement with its underlying premises. And to the extent that this conclusion rests on the language of the general articles, I think that it is simply mistaken. The words of Arts. 133 and 134 are vague beyond repair; I am no more able to discern objective standards of conduct from phrases such as 'conduct unbecoming an officer an da gnetleman' and 'conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces' than I am from such words as 'bad' or 'reprehensible.' Given this essential uncertainty, I cannot conclude that the statutory language clearly warned the appellee that his speech was illegal. It may have been, of course, that Dr. Levy had a subjective feeling that his conduct violated some military law. But that is not enough, for as we pointed out in Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 355\u2014356, n. 5, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 1703, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 '(t)he determination whether a criminal statute provides fair warning of its prohibitions must be made on the basis of the statute itself and the other pertinent law, rather than on the basis of an ad hoc appraisal of the subjective expectations of particular defendants.'\n\n\n41\n Cf. J. Heller, Catch-22, p. 395 (Dell ed. 1970):\n\"(W)e accuse you also of the commission of crimes and infractions we don't even know about yet. Guilty or innocent?\n\"I don't know, sir. How can I say if you don't tell me what they are?'\n\"How can we tell you if we don't know?\"\n\n\n42\n General Hodson suggests that in place of Art. 134, the Department of Defense and various military commanders could promulgate specific sets of orders, outlawing particular conduct. Those disobeying these orders could be prosecuted under Art. 92 of the UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 892, which outlaws the failure to obey any lawful order. See also Note, Taps for the Real Catch-22, 81 Yale L.J. 1518, 1537\u20141541, containing a similar suggestion.\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"418 U.S. 424\n94 S.Ct. 3042\n41 L.Ed.2d 855\nDouglas DORSZYNSKI, Petitioner,v.UNITED STATES.\nNo. 73\u20145284.\nArgued March 20, 1974.\nDecided June 26, 1974.\n\nSyllabus\nIn sentencing a youth offender as an adult under other applicable penal statutes, \u00a7 5010(d) of the Federal Youth Corrections Act requires a federal district court to 'find' that the offender would not benefit from treatment under the Act, but does not require that such 'finding' be accompanied by supporting reasons. Pp. 431\u2014444.\n(a) Section 5010(d)'s requirement of a 'no benefit' finding is not to be read as a substantive standard that must be satisfied to support a sentence outside the Act, for such a reading would not comport with the intent of the Act, as manifested by its legislative history, to increase federal trial judges' sentencing options, or with the traditional doctrine that the sentencing function is exclusively vested in the trial court and is not reviewable if within the terms of the statute. It therefore follows that requiring a statement of supporting reasons to accompany a 'no benefit' finding would limit the trial court's sentencing discretion since it would only serve to facilitate appellate review of sentencing, contrary to the intent of the Act. Pp. 436\u2014442.\n(b) Section 5010(d)'s 'no benefit' finding requirement was designed to insure that the sentencing judge deliberately exercised discretion in choosing not to commit a youth offender to treatment under the Act, such a finding making it clear that the judge was not only aware of the Act's existence but also of the youth offender's eligibility for treatment thereunder. Once it is made clear that the judge has considered the option of the Act's treatment and rejected it, no appellate review is warranted. Pp. 442\u2014443.\n484 F.2d 849, reversed and remanded.\nRobert H. Friebert for petitioner.\nGerald P. Norton, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nMr. Chief Justice BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nWe granted certiorari, 414 U.S. 1091, 94 S.Ct. 721, 38 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973), to resolve a conflict in the Circuits concerning whether, in sentencing a youth offender under other applicable penal statutes, \u00a7 5010(d) of the Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5005 et seq., requires a federal district court first to make an explicit finding, supported by reasons on the record, that the offender would not benefit from treatment under subsection (b) or (c) of \u00a7 5010. The Court of Appeals held that such a finding may be implied from the record, 484 F.2d 849 (CA7 (1973). Three Circuits have taken that position,1 and three Circuits have required an explicit finding accompanied by supporting reasons.2 We conclude that while an express finding of no benefit must be made on the record, the Act does not require that it be accompanied by supporting reasons. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.\n\n\n2\n* On October 19, 1971, a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs made arrangements with petitioner's codefendant, whose case is not before this Court, to purchase approximately 1,000 tablets of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) the following day. At the appointed hour on October 20, 1971, the undercover agent was shown approximately 1,000 LSD tablets in the possession of petitioner's co-defendant, who transferred the tablets to the agent. The exhibition and transfer took place in an automobile being driven by petitioner. After the tablets were transferred to the agent but before money had changed hands, petitioner and his codefendant were arrested. The complaint upon which the arrest warrant for petitioner issued charged him with knowingly and intentionally possessing approximately 1,000 tablets of LSD, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a).3 Subsequent to petitioner's release on his own recognizance, his counsel informed the District Court that petitioner intended to plead guilty to the charge, and requested the completion of a presentence report prior to the plea, as authorized by Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 32(c).\n\n\n3\nOn February 14, 1972, proceedings were had in the District Court upon the filing of an information, arraignment, plea, and sentence. The Government filed a one-count information charging petitioner and his co-defendant with a misdemeanor offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). The Government informed the court that the maximum sentence petitioner and his codefendant, who were first offenders under \u00a7 844(a), could receive was one year in prison, a fine of $5,000, or both; the court was also advised that since petitioner might have been under the age of 26, see n. 9, infra, he 'may also be subject to the Federal Youth Corrections Act.'4 App. 6. Petitioner, who was 19 years old at the time of the proceeding and had had no prior criminal record, pleaded guilty, as did his codefendant. After inquiry as prescribed by Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 11 to determine whether there was a basis in fact for petitioner's guilty plea, and whether it was entered voluntarily with understanding of its nature and consequences,5 the District Court accepted the plea.\n\n\n4\nSince petitioner desired to be sentenced at this proceeding, the District Court recessed to consider the presentence report, which petitioner's counsel had already read. After recess and before sentencing, petitioner was given his right to allocution, and petitioner's counsel requested the court that petitioner 'be placed . . . on probation under the Youth Corrections Act.' App. 13. See n. 4, supra. Petitioner then received a split sentence which remitted him to the custody of the Attorney General for one year, to serve 90 days' confinement 'in a jail-type or treatment' institution, although the judgment mentions only a 'jail-type' institution; the execution of the remainder of the sentence was suspended and petitioner was placed on probation for two years upon release from custody. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651.6 At no time during the proceeding, including sentencing, did the District Court make any reference to the Federal Youth Corrections Act.\n\n\n5\nOn May 1, 1972, after having filed numerous other post-conviction motions for relief, petitioner filed the motion at issue here, seeking relief pursuant to Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. 32(d) and 35, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, on two grounds. The first alleged that his guilty plea was not made understandingly; that issue is not before us. See n. 5, supra. The second alleged that the District Court was without jurisdiction to impose the sentence given because the court failed to make a finding that petitioenr would not derive benefit from treatment under \u00a7 5010(b) or (c), as assertedly required by \u00a7 5010(d). See n. 4, supra. The District Court held an evidentiary hearing to consider this motion, as well as other motions pending at that time. All were denied without opinion. The District Court stated at the postconviction hearing that the Act did not require an affirmative finding that petitioner would not benefit from treatment thereunder before the court could sentence him under other applicable penalty provisions; the court concluded that in committing petitioner for one year under a split sentence 'the (District) Court impliedly (held) the Youth Corrections Act (was) not applicable.' App. 45.\n\n\n6\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the view that trial judges must make an explicit finding that youth offenders would not benefit from treatment under the Act. The Court of Appeals held that such a determination may be implied from the record as a whole and that the imposition of the split sentence upon petitioner after his counsel had raised the possibility of sentencing under that Act satisfied \u00a7 5010(d). 484 F.2d, at 851.\n\nII\nThe Federal Youth Corrections Act\n\n7\nThe sole issue in this case is the validity of the sentence imposed by the District Court. Petitioner contends that before any adult sentence may be imposed \u00a7 5010(d) requires, first, that the sentencing judge find explicitly that the convicted defendant would receive no benefit from treatment under the Act and, second, that the sentencing judge must explain the reasons for his finding. We begin with the general proposition that once it is determined that a sentence is within the limitations set forth in the statute under which it is imposed, appellate review is at an end.7 Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386, 393, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 1284, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958); Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736, 741, 68 S.Ct. 1252, 1255, 92 L.Ed. 1690 (1948); Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 305, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). Our task, therefore, is to determine whether the sentence imposed here was permitted under \u00a7 5010(d) of the Act.\n\n\n8\nThe Federal Youth Corrections Act has been accurately described as the most comprehensive federal statute concerned with sentencing. United States v. Coefield, 155 U.S.App.D.C. 205, 209, 476 F.2d 1152, 1156 (1973). The Act is in substantial part an outgrowth of recommendations made by the Judicial Conference of the United States more than 30 years ago.8 The principles and procedures contained in the Conference recommendations were in turn largely based on those developed since 1894 for a system of treatment of young offenders in England, known as the Borstal system. See Criminal Justice Act of 1948, 11 & 12 Geo. 6, c. 58, and Criminal Justice Act of 1961, 9 & 10 Eliz. 2, c. 39. Statistics available at the time of the Conference study revealed the two principal motivating factors behind the enactment of the Act: first, the period of life between 16 and 22 years of age was found to be the time when special factors operated to produce habitual criminals. Second, then-existing methods of treating criminally inclined youths were found inadequate in avoiding recidivism. H.R.Rep.No.2979, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 2\u20143 (1950) (hereinafter H.R.Rep.No.2979). The Act was thus designed to provide a better method for treating young offenders convicted in federal courts in that vulnerable age bracket, to rehabilitate them and restore normal behavior patterns. Ibid.\n\n\n9\nTo accomplish this objective, federal district judges were given two new alternatives to add to the array of sentencing options previously available to them, see n. 9, infra: first, they were enabled to commit an eligible offender to the custody of the Attorney General for treatment under the Act. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b) and (c). Second, if they believed an offender did not need commitment, they were authorized to place him on probation under the Act. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(a). If the sentencing court chose the first alternative, the youth offender would be committed to the program of treatment created by the Act.\n\n\n10\nThe objective of these options represented a departure from traditional sentencing, and focused primarily on correction and rehabilitation. All persons under 22 years of age at the time of conviction were made eligible for probation or treatment under the Act,9 the latter defined as 'corrective and preventive guidance and training designed to protect the public by correcting (their) antisocial tendencies.' 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5006(e) and (g). To implement the program of treatment for youth offenders committed under the Act, a Youth Correction Division was created under the Board of Parole which, in conjunction with the Bureau of Prisons and the Probation Service, operates to provide the unique features of the Act's program. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5005.\n\n\n11\nAn important element of the program was that once a person was committed for treatment under the Act, the execution of sentence was to fit the person, not the crime for which he was convicted. Classification agencies were to be established by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to receive and study the person committed and make recommendations to the Director as to appropriate treatment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5014, 5015. Further, the range of treatment available was made broad to provide maximum flexibility. The Director was authorized both to adapt numerous public facilities, and to contract with public or private agencies, in order to provide institutional treatment which the Director could vary according to the committed person's progress or lack of it. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5011, 5015. An integral part of the treatment program was the segregation of the committed persons, insofar as practicable, so as to place them with those similarly committed, to avoid the influence of association with the more hardened inmates serving traditional criminal sentences. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5011.\n\n\n12\nIn addition to institutional treatment, the Division was empowered to order conditional release under supervision at any time of those committed under the Act, with federal probation officers providing the supervision.10 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5007, 5017, 5019. Conditional release was mandatory after a period of time fixed by the statutory formula. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5017. See n. 4, supra. The Division was further authorized to order the unconditional discharge of committed persons after a fixed period of treatment, and was required unconditionally to discharge them within a period also fixed by statutory formula. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5017. A powerful tool available to the Division was its discretion to discharge committed persons unconditionally before it was required to do so, for upon such discharge the conviction upon which the sentence rested would be automatically set aside. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5021(a). See n. 5, supra. Similarly, if the sentencing judge chose the second alternative created by the Act, i.e., placement of the youth offender on probation under its provisions, the judge himself could exercise his discretion to discharge the offender from probation unconditionally. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5021(b). See n. 6, supra. This, too, would result in the automatic setting aside of the offender's conviction 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5021(a).\n\n\n13\nThe foregoing describes the new options of treatment and probation made available to the federal sentencing courts under the Act.11 Our concern is not with the operation of these alternatives, but with the decision of the court to employ them, for the Act also preserved the power of trial judges to sentence youth offenders under 'any other applicable penalty provision.' It is to the question of when a judge may sentence a youth offender outside the Act that we now turn.\n\nIII\nSentencing Discretion Under the Act\n\n14\n(A)\n\n\n15\nThe language affecting the sentencing role of the judge under this Act is found in \u00a7 5010(d), which tells us:\n\n\n16\n'If the court shall find that the youth offender will not      derive benefit from treatment under subsection (b) or (c),      then the court may sentence the youth offender under any      other applicable penalty provision.'\n\n\n17\nOur concern is with the effect of the requirement of a 'no benefit' finding on the judge's sentencing discretion.\n\n\n18\nThe legislative history clearly indicates that the Act was meant to enlarge, not restrict, the sentencing options of federal trial courts in order to permit them to sentence youth offenders for rehabilitation of a special sort.\n\n\n19\n'The proposed legislation is designed to make available for      the discretionary use of the Federal judges a system for the      sentencing and treatment of (youth offenders) that will      promote the rehabilitation of those who in the opinion of the      sentencing judge show promise of becoming useful citizens . .      ..' H.R.Rep.No.2979, p. 1, U.S.Code Cong.Serv. 1950, p. 3983.      (Emphasis added.) 'The purpose of the proposed legislation is to provide a new      alternative sentencing and treatment procedure for (youth      offenders).' S.Rep.No.1180, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1949)      (hereinafter S.Rep.No.1180). (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n20\nThus, apart from the discretion vested in administrative agencies for treatment of those committed under the Act, as described in Part II, the Act was intended to broaden the scope of judicial sentencing discretion to include the alternatives of treatment or probation thereunder.\n\n\n21\nThe Act was a product of studies made by a committee of federal judges under the auspices of the Judicial Conference of the United States. The views of the sponsors as to the effect of the Act on the sentencing discretion of the trial courts are thus of particular importance, and they uniformly support the view that the Act was intended to preserve the unfettered sentencing discretion of federal district judges. Most pertinent is the statement made by the Chairman of the Judicial Conference special committee appointed to study punishment for crime, see n. 8, supra, Chief Judge John J. Parker, who testified before the Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which conducted the only hearings held on the bill (S. 2609) enacted as the Federal Youth Corrections Act. Judge Parker stated:\n\n\n22\n'(T)he act . . . does not interfere with the power of the      judge (with respect to sentencing youth offenders) but gives      him merely an alternative method of treatment of those      people. . . . He may still give the youthful offender the      punishment prescribed by existing statutes, there is nothing      in the bill that prevents that. All that the bill does is to      provide that if in his judgment and discretion, he thinks      that the offender before the court is one that can be treated with advantage under this bill, he can sentence him under      this bill instead of under the existing law.\n\n\n23\n'. . . I do not see any possible objection (to the Act). They      say that there are some of these fellows that ought to be      given serious punishment notwithstanding their being young      and it (the Act) does not prevent their being given serious      punishment. Nothing prevents a man from getting 25 years      punishment if he deserves it. Nothing prevents his being      executed if he deserves such sentence.' Hearings on S. 1114      and S. 2609 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on      the Judiciary, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 43\u201444 (1949)      (hereinafter Hearings).\n\n\n24\nTo the same effect is the statement made by Circuit Judge Orie L. Phillips, the Chairman of the Conference subcommittee which gave particular attention to the treatment of youth offenders. See n. 8, supra. In response to the statement of Senator Kilgore, sponsor of S. 2609, that the bill 'takes nothing' (in terms of sentencing) 'away from the court,' Judge Phillips replied: 'That is correct; it is purely optional.' Hearings 69. Earlier Judge Phillips had said of the bill: 'That is merely a flexibility and it is not a command that he send the boys up,' to which Senator Kilgore replied: 'I agree with you on that . . ..' Id., at 67. To the extent other testimony and the debates addressed the question of sentencing discretion under the Act, they invariably reflected the same view,12 as did the House Report, quoted above, and the Department of Justice, which recommended enactment of S. 2609 and noted that the bill 'would not deprive the court of any of its present functions as to sentencing.' S.Rep.No.1180, pp. 10\u201411. The Senate Report's language was identical to that of the Department of Justice.13 Id., at 1. The legislative history of the Act confirms the conclusion that Congress did not intend to alter or circumscribe the sentencing discretion of federal district judges by requiring that any substantive standard be met before the imposition of sentence. There is virtual unanimity of opinion in the legislative history that the Act was intended to increase the sentencing options of federal trial judges, rather than to limit the exercise of their discretion whether to employ the newly created options.\n\n\n25\nTo construe \u00a7 5010(d)'s requirement of a 'no benefit' finding to circumscribe that discretion would be incompatible with a clear congressional intent; such a construction would also be at odds with traditional sentencing doctrine. The intent of Congress was in accord with long-established authority in the United States vesting the sentencing function exclusively in the trial court.14\n\n\n26\n'If there is one rule in the federal criminal practice which is firmly established, it is that the appellate      court has no control over a sentence which is within the      limits allowed by a statute.' Gurera v. United States, 40      F.2d 338, 340\u2014341 (CA8 1930).\n\n\n27\nSee Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958); Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736, 68 S.Ct. 1252, 92 L.Ed. 1690 (1948); Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932).\n\n\n28\nThe statutes referred to in this line of cases established a permissible range within which sentences could be imposed; if a judge imposed a sentence within that range, his exercise of discretion as to where within the permissible range sentence should be fixed was not subject to challenge. The authority to sentence a youth ofender under 'any other applicable penalty provision' is expressly reserved to federal trial courts by \u00a7 5010(d), and thus is within the permissible range of sentences which may be imposed under the Act. The 'no benefit' finding required by the Act is not to be read as a substantive standard which must be satisfied to support a sentence outside the Act, for such a reading would subject the sentence to appellate review even though the sentence was permitted by the Act's terms, thereby limiting the sentencing court's discretion. We will not assume Congress to have intended such a departure from well-established doctrine without a clear expression to disavow it. As our review has shown, the exclusive sentencing power of district judges was acknowledged, and Congress' intention to affirm that power was clearly indicated.\n\n\n29\nFrom our conclusion that a finding of 'no benefit' was not intended to constitute a substantive standard, it follows that a sentence outside the Act need not be accompanied by a statement of reasons why the court chose such a sentence. The only purpose of such a requirement would be to facilitate appellate supervision of, and thus to limit, the trial court's sentencing discretion.15 In short, we hold that the discretion vested in a district judge under \u00a7 5010(d) is essentially the same as the traditional discretion vested in the court, for example, to impose the minimum sentence on a first offender or a larger sentence on a recidivist. If the failure of a court to sentence a particular youth offender under the Act appears 'too harsh, the remedy must be afforded by act of Congress, not by judicial legislation under the guise of construction,' Blockburger, supra, at 305, 52 S.Ct., at 182, since '(w)hatever views may be entertained regarding severity of punishment . . . (t) hese are peculiarly questions of legislative policy.' Gore, supra, 357 U.S., at 393, 78 S.Ct., at 1285.\n\n\n30\n(B)\n\n\n31\nAlthough the Act was not in any way intended to circumscribe the discretion of sentencing courts, it did provide a new sentencing alternative designed to prevent youthful offenders from continuing their involvement in criminal conduct after the expiration of their sentence. In the novelty of the treatment option made available, and the importance of the objective it was to serve, lies the purpose of \u00a7 5010(d)'s requirement that the court find 'no benefit' before imposing a sentence other than one under \u00a7 5010(b) or (c).\n\n\n32\nAlthough well-established doctrine bars review of the exercise of sentencing discretion, limited review is available when sentencing discretion is not exercised at all. Yates v. United States, 356 U.S. 363, 366\u2014367, 78 S.Ct. 766, 768\u2014769, 2 L.Ed.2d 837 (1958); United States v. Daniels, 446 F.2d 967, 972 (CA6 1971); United States v. Williams, 407 F.2d 940, 945 (CA4 1969). See also n. 7, supra. The requirement of the 'no benefit' finding was designed to insure that the sentencing judge exercised his discretion in choosing not to commit a youth offender to treatment under the Act. Such a finding would make unmistakably clear that the sentencing judge was not only aware of the existence of the new Act, but also knew that the youth offender before him was eligible because of his age for the treatment it provided to accomplish its important purpose.\n\n\n33\n'Appellate modification of a statutorily-authorized sentence      . . . is an entirely different matter than the careful      scrutiny of the judicial process by which the particular      punishment was determined. Rather than an unjustified      incursion into the province of the sentencing judge, this      latter responsibility is, on the contrary, a necessary      incident of what has always been appropriate appellate review      of criminal cases.' United States v. Hartford, 489 F.2d 652,      654 (CA5 1974). (Emphasis in original.)\n\n\n34\nOnce it is made clear that the sentencing judge has considered the option of treatment under the Act and rejected it, however, no appellate review is warranted.\n\n\n35\nThe question whether the finding of 'no benefit' must be explicit or whether it may be implicit in the record of a particular case is answered by the manifest desire of Congress to assure that treatment under the Act be considered by the court as one option whenever the youth offender is eligible for it. If the finding may be implied from the record, appellate courts must go on to determine what constitutes a sufficient showing of the requisite implication. To hold that a 'no benefit' finding is implicit each time a sentence under the Act is not chosen would render \u00a7 5010(d) nugatory; to hold that something more is necessary to support the inference that must be found in the record would create an ad hoc rule. Appellate courts should not be subject to the burden of case-by-case examination of the record to make sure that the sentencing judge considered the treatment option made available by the Act. Literal compliance with the Act can be satisfied by any expression that makes clear the sentencing judge considered the alternative of sentencing under the Act and decided that the youth offender would not derive benefit from treatment under the Act.\n\n\n36\nThis case provides an example of the problems arising when the required finding is left to implication. Counsel's references to the Act followed by the District Court's sentence indeed afford support for the argument that, by implication, the options of the Act were considered and rejected. However at the post-conviction hearing the District Court found from the record of the sentencing hearing the implication that the Act was 'not applicable.' It is thus unclear whether this meant the court believed petitioner to be legally ineligible for treatment under the Act\u2014which would be error\u2014or whether, realizing he was eligible, nevertheless deliberately opted to sentence him as an adult. An explicit finding that petitioner would not have benefited from treatment under the Act would have removed all doubt concerning whether the enlarged discretion Congress provided to sentencing courts was indeed exercised.\n\n\n37\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to the end that the District Court conduct further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n38\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n39\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, Mr. Justice BRENNAN, and Mr. Justice STEWART join, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n40\nThe Court is today called upon to construe the provision of the Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5005 et seq., defining the circumstances under which a youth offender may be sentenced as an adult. The Youth Corrections Act (YCA) provides a comprehensive sentencing scheme for offenders between the ages of 18 and 22, affording trial judges four options for sentencing such offenders. The judge may suspend imposition or execution of sentence and place the offender on probation. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(a). Alternatively, the judge may sentence the offender for treatment and supervision at a special youth facility, to be discharged in no more than 6 years, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b), or he may commit the offender to a youth institution for a term which may exceed 6 years, up to the maximum period authorized by law for the offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(c).1 Finally, the judge may sentence the offender as an adult, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(d), which provides that:\n\n\n41\n'If the court shall find that the youth offender will not      derive benefit from treatment under subsection (b) or (c),      then the court may sentence the youth offender under any      other applicable penalty provision.'\n\n\n42\nI agree with the Court's holding that \u00a7 5010(d) requires an explicit finding of 'no benefit' as a condition precedent to sentencing an eligible offender as an adult, ante, at 444, but I find that holding patently inconsistent with the Court's assertion that a sentencing judge need only be aware of the applicability of the Act and choose to reject it in order to satisfy the clear admonition of \u00a7 5010(d). As construed by the Court, the '(o benefit' finding is not a finding at all.\n\n\n43\nI am convinced that the Act was meant to 'provides a preferred sentencing alternative which must be used in sentencing a youthful offender unless, in the language of \u00a7 5010(d), 'the court shall find that the youth offender will not derive benefit from treatment . . .\" under the Act. Cox v. United States, 473 F.2d 334, 337 (CA4 1973) (en banc) (emphasis added). And, I fundamentally disagree with the Court's holding that merely by tracking the statutory 'no benefit' language a sentencing judge can satisfy the 'finding' requirement of \u00a7 5010(d). I would require that the explicit 'no benefit' finding be augmented by a statement of the reasons for imposing an adult sentence.\n\n\n44\n* I find no basis in either the language or history of the YCA to support the Court's observation that the Act was intended to 'preserve unfettered' the discretion of the sentencing judge. Ante, at 437. The YCA was the product of more than 10 years of study by various groups and was modeled after the English Borstal system, which had achieved substantial success in rehabilitating young offenders.2 The initial legislative proposal, an American Law Institute model Act, removed the power to sentence eligible offenders from the trial judges altogether and reposed that power in a correctional authority.3 Not surprisingly, that proposal brought swift and sharp criticism from the judges whose power was to be sharply curtailed. The next proposal, by the Judicial Conference, involved shared sentencing powers between trial judges and correctional authorities.4 It met with similar criticism. The 1949 proposal, which was finally enacted into law, retained sentencing power in the trial judge. As the Court today points out, the drafters of the Act repeatedly emphasized that the legislation \"does not interfere with the (sentencing) power of the judge . . ..' Ante, at 437.\n\n\n45\nBut even the very first Judicial Conference proposal contained a provision specifically requiring the trial judge to make a finding that a youth offender would not benefit from treatment and should not be committed under the Act, before sentencing him under any other penalty provisions.5 This finding requirement was adapted from the similar Borstal provision which disallows a sentencing court to 'impose imprisonment on a person under twenty-one years of age unless . . . no other (Borstal) method of dealing with him is appropriate . . ..'6 The finding requirement of the Judicial Conference draft was not subject to the same criticism as the provisions which actually removed, rather than limited, the exercise of trial judges' sentencing discretion, and the finding requirement was ultimately enacted into law as \u00a7 5010(d).\n\n\n46\nThe finding requirement is an integral part of the YCA scheme. The stated premise of the Act is that young people between the ages of 18 and 22, especially, are promising subjects for rehabilitation.7 The purpose of the legislation was, for those offenders, to 'substitute for retributive punishment methods of training and treatment designed to correct and prevent anti-social tendencies. It departs from the mere punitive idea of dealing with criminals and looks primarily to the objective idea of rehabilitation.' H.R.Rep. No. 2979, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1950), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1950, p. 3985.8 It is clear that from its very inception, the youth corrections program was intended to establish among the goals judges could consider in sentencing eligible offenders, one as paramount\u2014that of rehabilitation.9 And, in this limited sense, the sentencing discretion of trial judges is necessarily circumscribed in regard to youth offenders. The finding requirement of \u00a7 5010(d) effectuates this policy by permitting eligible offenders to be deprived of the rehabilitative treatment provided under the Act only where they would not benefit therefrom.\n\n\n47\nThe Senate Report accompanying the bill explained the circumstances under which adult sentencing would be proper:\n\n\n48\n'If . . . the judge is convinced the youth is incorrigible      and would derive no help from the program, he may sentence      him under any applicable provision of law.' S.Rep.No.1180,      81st Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1949).\n\n\n49\nOther aspects of the legislative history underscore Congress' intention that the Act provide a preferred sentencing alternative for eligible offenders. Senator Kilgore, one of the sponsors of the legislation, observed that given the requisite finding 'only about 10 percent of (eligible offenders would) eventually have to (be) sentence(d as adults), or less.' Hearing on S. 895 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., 13 (1943). The House Report concluded that even given the instances in which YCA rehabilitative treatment would fail 'more than 70 percent (of eligible youth offenders) can be rehabilitated' under the Act. H.R.Rep.No.2979, supra, at 10; U.S.Code Cong.Serv. 1950, p. 3993. The panoply of treatment options10 available under the Act is but further evidence that the YCA program was intended to be sufficiently comprehensive to deal with all but the 'incorrigible' youth.\n\n\n50\nThis congressional intent finds clear expression in the words of the statute. Section 5010(d) does not say the sentencing court must merely consider the treatment option provided by the Act, it says in the most uncompromising terms that the court must find the youth 'will not benefit' from YCA treatment as a prerequisite to imposing an adult sentence. The use of the words 'shall find' emphasizes the mandatory nature of that finding. The specific quality of the finding is underscored by \u00a7 5010(e) which provides for an eligible offender to be temporarily committed for observation and study for the purpose of providing the sentencing court with a report on the particular question defined by \u00a7 5010(d)\u2014whether the youth offender would benfit from treatment under the Act.11\n\n\n51\nThus, while the Act does not remove a trial judge's responsibility or discretion for the sentencing determination, it does provide a preferred disposition for eligible offenders. A sentencing judge is not required to sentence a youth offender under the Act; the judge can still exercise his 'sound discretion to deny such rehabilitative treatment to those youths in the exceptional cases where the judge determines that the special youth treatment afforded by the Act would be of no value.' United States v. Waters, 141 U.S.App.D.C. 289, 291, 437 F.2d 722, 724 (1970). The legislative history relied on by the Court merely emphasizes this point\u2014that the Act was intended to be another sentencing alternative available to the trial judge and that the decision as to whether it should be employed in a particular case remains a decision committed to his discretion. That history is not, however, inconsistent with what seems to me the plain meaning of the words of the statute\u2014that the sentencing jduge's discretion is circumscribed by the affirmative finding requirement of \u00a7 5010(d).12 The YCA 'provides a preferred sentencing alternative' which must be used in sentencing a youth unless the facts of the individual case meet the statutory requirement\u2014unless, in the language of \u00a7 5010(d), the court finds that the youth offender will not derive benefit from treatment under the Act.13 Cox v. United States, 473 F.2d, at 337; United States v. Waters, 141 U.S.App.D.C. 292\u2014293, 437 F.2d, at 725\u2014726. Every Court of Appeals which has considered the issue, except the court below, has agreed that the manner in which the sentencing judge exercises his discretion is thus limited. Brooks v. United States, 497 F.2d 1059 (CA6 1974); United States v. Kaylor, 491 F.2d 1133 (CA2 1974) (en banc); United States v. Schenker, 486 F.2d 318 (CA5 1973); United States v. Coefield, 155 U.S.App.D.C. 205, 476 F.2d 1152 (1973) (en banc); Cox v. United States, supra; Williams v. United States, 476 F.2d 970 (CA3 1973); see United States v. MacDonald, 455 F.2d 1259, 1265 (CA1 1972);14 cf. Small v. United States, 304 A.2d 641 (D.C.Ct.App.1973).\n\n\n52\nThe proposed amendment was not enacted.\n\n\n53\nIn a sense, the Court today also recognizes the inherent limitation on the judge's discretion imposed by \u00a7 5010(d) by requiring an explicit 'no benefit' finding as a prerequisite to adult sentencing. As conceived by the Court, however, the required 'no benefit' finding is no finding at all, but merely a ritualistic invocation of the statutory language. In explaining why the 'no benefit' finding must be explicit, the Court notes that '(t)o hold that a 'no benefit' finding is implicit each time a sentence under the Act is not chosen would render \u00a7 5010(d) nugatory.' Ante, at 444. Despite these protestations, the Court today renders the finding requirement of \u00a7 5010(d) a nullity. By holding that the Act was intended to preserve 'the unfettered sentencing discretion of federal district judges,' ante, at 437 and that sentencing judges need only have 'considered the option of treatment under the Act and rejected it,' ante, at 443, the Court effectively reads the unambiguous mandate of a 'no benefit' finding out of the Act. A mere parroting of the statutory language is hardly an affirmative finding. The Court's opinion seems to indicate that the sentencing judge need not mean what he says when he pronounces the 'no benefit' litany. Although the Court requires him to go through the charade of saying that the offender would not benefit from treatment under the Act, it apparently does not require that the judge actually find no benefit but only that he be aware of the Act and reject it. I think it remarkable that this Court should approve such an empty and duplicitous ritual.\n\nII\n\n54\nIf the Court were to hold that the Act limited a trial judge's discretion by requiring that he actually find a youth offender would not benefit from YCA treatment before sentencing him as an adult, I would think that more than a mere recitation of the conclusory finding of 'no benefit' should be required. To say that simply invoking the words of the statute satisfies the mandate of \u00a7 5010(d) affords far too little credence both to Congress' deep concern for the rehabilitative potential of young offenders and to its obvious intention that eligible offenders be sentenced under the Act if they would benefit from its rehabilitative programs. To give effect to these concerns, I would reuire that the trial judge include, on the record, a statement which makes clear that he considered the provisions of the Act, weighed the treatment option available, and decided in light of his familiarity with the offender that he would not derive benefit from treatment under the Act.15\n\n\n55\nThe mere recitation of the 'no benefit' litany can hardly bear the weight of demonstrating such compliance. By taking the unusual step of requiring a specific finding in this limited but highly important area of sentencing, Congress mandated a reasoned determination that the offender would not benefit from the rehabilitative treatment available under the Act. Accordingly, in my view, a statement of the factors which informed and shaped the sentencing decision must accompany the conclusory finding of 'no benefit' if that congressional purpose is to be served.\n\n\n56\nThe Borstal system, which provided the model for the youth corrections scheme in general and the requirement of \u00a7 5010(d) in particular, envisions a trial judge stating his reasons for sentencing an eligible offender as an adult.16 Similarly, most of the Courts of Appeals which have faced the issue have required a statement of reasons as a necessary concomitant of the \u00a7 5010(d) finding. A unanimous en banc decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and a near-unanimous en banc decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit17 have found a statement of reasons supporting the 'no benefit' finding to be \"essential to a knowledgeable administration of the Act . . ..\" United States v. Kaylor, 491 F.2d, at 1139; United States v. Coefield, 155 U.S.App.D.C., at 210, 476 F.2d, at 1157. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has, more recently, held that a statement of reasons accompanying adult sentencing is 'necessary to insure that the sentencing court . . . has deliberately considered whether a youth offender may benefit from the treatment provided for in the Act . . ..' Brooks v. United States, 497 F.2d, at 1063.\n\n\n57\nSimilarly the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit recently remanded a case for consideration of whether treatment under the Act would be beneficial to the offender and specifically ordred the trial judge to state the reasons for his conclusion. Cox v. United States, 473 F.2d, at 337. In fact, the court below is the only Court of Appeals to specifically disavow a requirement of reasons for a \u00a7 5010(d) sentence.18\n\n\n58\nContrary to the Court's assertion that appellate review is the only purpose to be served by a statement of reasons, that requirement serves a number of other important policies. First, it might well contribute to rationalizing the sentencing process and to decreasing disparities in sentences. Articulating reasons should assist a trial judge in developing for himself a consistent set of principles on which to base his sentencing decisions. Requiring '(s)uch a procedure would encourage the judge to clarify and justify, in his own mind, the grounds for the sentence he chooses. As a result, sentencing decisions would tend, on the whole, to be more carefully thought out.' United States v. Velazquez, 482 F.2d 139, 142 (CA2 1973); Accord, United States v. Brown, 479 F.2d 1170, 1172 (CA2 1973).\n\n\n59\nThe reasons may also be of use to correctional authorities in their handling of the prisoner after sentence. The kind of correctional and rehabilitative treatment an offender receives should take into account the reasons for his sentence.\n\n\n60\nA disclosure of reasons may also aid the defendant's counsel to insure that the sentence is not premised on misinformation or inaccuracies in the material upon which the sentencing judge relies. 'A Sphinx-like silence on the court's part precludes anyone (including the parties, (and) the judge . . .) from learning whether he acted in error.' Id., at 1173; cf. United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972).\n\n\n61\nMoreover, an articulation of reasons may actually contribute to the offender's rehabilitation by avoiding any feeling that his sentence was arbitrary.19 Mr. Justice (then Judge) STEWART observed:\n\n\n62\n'Justice is measured in many ways, but to a convicted      criminal its surest measure lies in the fairness of the      sentence he receives. . . . It is an anomaly that a judicial      system which has developed so scrupulous a concern for the      protection of a criminal defendant throughout every other      stage of the proceedings against him should have so neglected      this important dimension of fundamental justice.' Shepard v.      United States, 257 F.2d 293, 294 (CA6 1958).\n\n\n63\nIf reasons were articulated for the sentencing decision, an offender would be less apt to perceive his fate as being arbitrarily determined.20 Reasoned decisions may even enhance the legitimacy of the sentencing process as perceived by the general public for, as noted by the Report of the American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice:\n\n\n64\n'It is hardly commanding of public respect for our system on      the one hand to increase the alternatives of the sentencing      judge so that he can shape his sentence to fit each case, and      on the other hand to take the position that he need not explain why he selects a      particular sentence . . ..'21\n\n\n65\nAlthough these considerations apply to sentencing decisions generally,22 I do not mean to suggest that reasons are required in any other sentencing context. Contrary to the majority's accusations, my view of the Act does not require wholesale abandonment of 'traditional sentencing doctrine.' Ante, at 440. We are concerned here with only a limited, albeit important, area of sentencing for which Congress has established special rules. Congress' urgent concern for the rehabilitative potential of young offenders and the specific-finding requirement of \u00a7 5010(d) make the need for reasons particularly compelling in this context. Requiring a statement of reasons would encourage trial judges to direct their attention to the crucial questions of benefit and treatment, to take a hard look at the relevant factors, and to focus on value judgments inherent in their sentencing decision. See United States v. Phillips, 156 U.S.App.D.C. 217, 479 F.2d 1200 (1973). It is clearly consonant with the Act to require such reasoned consideration. I must agree with the perceptive observations of Senior Judge Fahy of the District of Columbia Circuit that requiring a statement of reasons is essential to assure:\n\n\n66\n'firstly, that the District Judge manifest not only an      awareness that the Act is applicable to the case, but also an      accurate understanding of the scope of his discretion under      the Act; secondly, that the District Judge has been informed      of the pertinent facts relating to the individual defendant      before him, either by evidence coming to his attention in the      trial, by a presentence report, or by a recommendation and      report made under section 5010(e); and thirdly, that the      District Judge, by his statement of reasons where required,      has given consideration and related the facts of the      individual case to the applicable law.' United States v.      Coefield, 155 U.S.App.D.C., at 210\u2014211, 476 F.2d, at 1157      1158 (footnote omitted).\n\n\n67\nSection 5010(e) of the Act provides a mechanism for the trial judge to secure the expert assistance of correctional authorities in determining whether an eligible offender would benefit from treatment. I agree with the two Courts of Appeals which have passed on the issue that:\n\n\n68\n'(W)hen a judge has availed himself of the assistance      afforded by \u00a7 5010(e), that is to say, where he has ordered      the youth offender committed . . . for observation and study      . . . and the Division has made its report to the court, and      after considering the report has followed its findings or      recommendation in imposing sentence, additional reasons are      not required to be stated, although, of course, the judge is not prevented from stating his own reasons.' United      States v. Kaylor, 491 F.2d, at 1139.\n\n\n69\nAccord, United States v. Coefield, 155 U.S.App.D.C. 205, at 210, 476 F.2d 1152, at 1157. But the Act clearly intended that the ultimate sentencing decision remain with the trial judge. That decision should not pass by abdication to the correctional authorities who prepare the \u00a7 5010(e) study. Thus, where a trial judge secures a \u00a7 5010(e) report, he should adopt its reasons as his own only after assuring himself of the adequacy of the report and propriety of its recommendation.23\n\n\n70\nI see no reason to reach here the issue of appellate review of the District Court's imposition of an adult sentence. I believe that the Youth Corrections Act provides a preferred-sentencing alternative which can only be abandoned on the basis of a finding that an eligible offender will not benefit from treatment under the Act. The District Court imposed sentence on the assumption that the YCA was not a preferred disposition and no finding was required. The Court today finds the District Court's sentence invalid only for failure to make the required 'no benefit' finding. Under either the Court's view or my own, the appellate-review question is clearly not yet presented by this case.24\n\n\n71\nAccordingly, I concur in the judgment of the Court insofar as it reverses and remands because the District Court failed to make the requisite 'no benefit' finding. I disagree, however, with the opinion of the Court insofar as it suggests that a merely conclusory statement of 'no benefit' satisfies the statutory requirement and insofar as it purports to pass, albeit in dicta, on the question of appellate review of a \u00a7 5010(d) adult sentence, an issue not before this Court.\n\n\n\n1\n Williams v.

United States, 304 A.2d 641 (DC Ct.App.1973).\n\n\n3\n Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 made petitioner punishable as a principal for any offense against the United States committed by his codefendant. Title 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) makes punishable the knowing or intentional possession of a controlled substance such as LSD when not obtained pursuant to a valid prescription or order, or as otherwise authorized by law.\n\n\n4\n The sentencing provisions of the Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010, are as follows:\n'(a) If the court is of the opinion that the youth offender does not need commitment, it may suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and place the youth offender on probation.\n'(b) If the court shall find that a convicted person is a youth offender, and the offense is punishable by imprisonment under applicable provisions of law other than this subsection, the court may, in lieu of the penalty of imprisonment otherwise provided by law, sentence the youth offender to the custody of the Attorney General for treatment and supervision pursuant to this chapter until discharged by the Division as provided in section 5017(c) of this chapter; or\n'(c) If the court shall find that the youth offender may not be able to derive maximum benefit from treatment by the Division prior to the expiration of six years from the date of conviction it may, in lieu of the penalty of imprisonment otherwise provided by law, sentence the youth offender to the custody of the Attorney General for treatment and supervision pursuant to this chapter for any further period that may be authorized by law for the offense or offenses of which he stands convicted or until discharged by the Division as provided in section 5017(d) of this chapter.\n'(d) If the court shall find that the youth offender will not derive benefit from treatment under subsection (b) or (c), then the court may sentence the youth offender under any other applicable penalty provision.\n'(e) If the court desires additional information as to whether a youth offender will derive benefit from treatment under\nsubsection (b) or (c) it may order that he be committed to the custody of the Attorney General for observation and study at an appropriate classification center or agency. Within sixty days from the date of the order, or such additional period as the court may grant, the Division shall report to the court its findings.'\nThe release of youth offenders committed under \u00a7 5010 is governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5017, which provides in part:\n'(a) The Division may at any time after reasonable notice to the Director release conditionally under supervision a committed youth offender. When, in the judgment of the Director, a committed youth offender should be released conditionally under supervision he shall so report and recommend to the Division.\n'(b) The Division may discharge a committed youth offender unconditionally at the expiration of one year from the date of conditional release.\n'(c) A youth offender committed under section 5010(b) of this chapter shall be released conditionally under supervision on or before the expiration of four years from the date of his conviction and shall be discharged unconditionally on or before six years from the date of his conviction.\n'(d) A youth offender committed under section 5010(c) of this chapter shall be released conditionally under supervision not later than two years before the expiration of the term imposed by the court. He may be discharged unconditionally at the expiration of not less than one year from the date of his conditional release. He shall be discharged unconditionally on or before the expiration of the maximum sentence imposed, computed uninterruptedly from the date of conviction.'\n\n\n5\n Although petitioner's complaint here is that he was not sentenced under the Act, following his conviction he challenged the validity of his plea in part on the ground that he was not informed that under\nthe Act he could have received a sentence of incarceration and supervision up to a period of six years, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5010(b) and 5017(c), see n. 4, supra, in asserted violation of Rule 11. The District Court denied relief on this ground; that ruling has not been challenged.\n\n\n6\n There is no contention made that the District Court could not place petitioner on probation under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651, as opposed to probation under the Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(a). See United States v. Kurzyna, 485 F.2d 517 (CA2 1973). Petitioner was released from confinement to probation on May 11, 1972, with the special condition that his probation terminate May 11, 1974. Although by now petitioner may have fully served his sentence, including probation, he still suffers the disabilities accompanying a criminal misdemeanor conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). While the provision under which he was sentenced to probation, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651, does not provide for relief from these disabilities, the Act does so in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5021, by its provision for setting aside the conviction of a youth offender:\n'(a) Upon the unconditional discharge by the division of a committed youth offender before the expiration of the maximum sentence imposed upon him, the conviction shall be automatically set aside and\nthe division shall issue to the youth offender a certificate to that effect.\n'(b) Where a youth offender has been placed on probation by the court, the court may thereafter, in its discretion, unconditionally discharge such youth offender from probation prior to the expiration of the maximum period of probation theretofore fixed by the court, which discharge shall automatically set aside the conviction, and the court shall issue to the youth offender a certificate to that effect.'\nDespite the expiration of petitioner's sentence, then, he may still receive the benefit of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5021 if he is resentenced under the Act. To be eligible to have his conviction set aside under the Act, petitioner would have to be committed under \u00a7 5010(b) or (c), or placed on probation under \u00a7 5010(a), and achieve the early discharge required by \u00a7 5021(a) or (b). While this might require the imposition of a longer sentence than he originally received, petitioner represents through counsel that he would voluntarily seek resentencing which would place him back on probation. Tr. of Oral Arg. 8, 16\u201418. The District Court would then be able, as a matter of discretion, to provide the requisite early unconditional discharge. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5021(b).\n\n\n7\n There is no contention here that the District Court relied upon improper or inaccurate information. United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972). Petitioner contends he was denied due process because he was deprived of his claimed right to be sentenced under the Act, without a reasoned explanation on the record for the asserted deprivation. We need not address this contention, for it was not raised before the District Court, the Court of Appeals, or in the questions presented in the petition for certiorari. Phillips Chemical Co. v. Dumas Independent School Dist., 361 U.S. 376, 386 n. 12, 80 S.Ct. 474, 480, 4 L.Ed.2d 384 (1960); Irvine v. California, 347 U.S. 128, 129\u2014130, 74 S.Ct. 381, 382, 98 L.Ed. 561 (1954); Radio Officers' Union v. NLRB, 347 U.S. 17, 37 n. 35, 74 S.Ct. 323, 334, 98 L.Ed. 455 (1954).\n\n\n8\n In 1941 Mr. Chief Justice Stone requested the Judicial Conference to study the general subject of punishment for crime. The Chief Justice appointed four federal courts of appeals judges and three district judges to the committee which undertook the study. A subcommittee gave particular attention to the treatment of youth offenders. The committee made a report to the Judicial Conference in 1942, and developed a draft of an act to provide a correctional system for adult and youth offenders. The report as adopted by the Conference was first presented to Congress in 1943. The recommendations regarding youth offenders were largely adopted by Congress in 1949 in the bill which became the Federal Youth Corrections Act in 1950.\n\n\n9\n The Act is ordinarily not applied to convicted persons under the age of 18, who are eligible for sentencing under the provisions of the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5031 et seq. And certain multiple offenders in the District of Columbia are, despite their qualifying age, barred from sentencing under the Act. D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 22\u20143202(d)(1). By contrast, convicted persons between the ages of 22 and 26, termed 'young adult' offenders, may be sentenced for treatment under the Act if 'the court finds that there is reasonable groun(d) to believe that the defendant will benefit from' treatment under the Act. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4209. Of course, adult offenders are eligible for sentencing only under statutory provisions different from those available for juveniles, youth offenders, and young adult offenders.\n\n\n10\n In 1952, Congress amended \u00a7 5024 of the Act, and added \u00a7\u00a7 5025 and 5026, in order to extend the Act's coverage to youth offenders convicted in the District of Columbia. 66 Stat. 45. In 1967, Congress further amended these sections, withdrawing from the Bureau of Prisons and the Youth Correction Division control of District of Columbia youth offenders during their commitment and after their release. Control during these periods was instead given to the Commissioner of the District of Columbia, who could in turn delegate this authority to the D.C. Department of Corrections, in order to provide continuity of treatment.\n\n\n11\n In recognition of the difficulty of ascertaining whether, and if so which type of, treatment under the Act would benefit a youth offender, the Act also permits the sentencing court to commit the offender to one of the above classification agencies where, following observation and study, the Youth Correction Division reports its findings to the court within 60 days. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(e).\n\n\n12\n The only other judges to testify before the Senate Subcommittee were also in accord. District Judge Carroll Hincks, who served on the Conference subcommittee studying treatment of youth offenders, stated:\n'I think when the judges say they are opposed to the predecessor of this bill, if you could talk with them, you would find that . . . they\nwould not themselves want to use it. Very well, they do not have to use it.' Hearings 57.\nDistrict Judge Bolitha J. Laws, who served on the Conference special committee studying general punishment for crime, stated:\n'I have already told you that this law is purely an optional situation. A judge who feels that the present system is in all respects perfect and who does not want to use the new provisions, except perhaps rarely, does not have to use them. He still may do one of two things. He may admit the man to probation, or he may send him to an institution exactly as he does now.' Id., at 15.\nMr. James V. Bennett, Director, Bureau of Prisons, testified similarly:\n'I would like to . . . reemphasize more than Judge Laws has done, that this bill is discretionary . . .. (I)t is very difficult for me to conceive of anybody who could rightfully object to the bill because they can use it or not, as they see fit . . ..' Id., at 25.\nDuring the Senate debate over the bill, Senator Kilgore made clear his position of the matter of sentencing discretion under the bill:\n'Its purpose is to grant to trial courts . . . some additional facilities . . . to try certain correctional methods. Use of the system provided by this measure would not be mandatory.' 96 Cong.Rec. 8267 (1950). There was no discussion of sentencing discretion by anyone other than Senator Kilgore in either the Senate or House debates.\n\n\n13\n The Senate Report also noted that the sentencing judge may sentence a youth offender under applicable provisions other than the Act if, after receiving a pre-sentence diagnosis under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(e), see n. 11, supra, he is convinced the youth is 'incorrigible and would derive no help from the program.' S.Rep.No.1180, p. 5. The remark was made in the context of a discussion concerning the need sentencing judges hve for additional information about youth offenders they must sentence, and indicated merely that temporary commitment under \u00a7 5010(e) would not deprive the judge\nof the discretion to sentence the youth outside the Act, citing illustratively the prototype of youth offender whom judges would not likely desire to sentence under the Act.\n\n\n14\n To the extent reference was made to the English Borstal system for treating young offenders in drafting the Act, that reference did not include the English view of the trial court's discretion to make use of that system. Circuit Judge (now Chief Judge) Kaufman of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has stated:\n'At present the United States is the only nation in the free world where one judge can determine conclusively, decisively and finally the minimum period of time a defendant must remain in prison, without being subject to any review of his determination.' Symposium, Appellate Review of Sentences, 32 F.R.D. 257, 260\u2014261 (1962).\nProfessor Sanford H. Kadish also notes that in the United States, the 'discretion of the judge . . . in (sentencing) matters is virtually free of substantive control or guidance,' Kadish, Legal Norm and Discretion in the Police and Sentencing Processes, 75 Harv.L.Rev. 904, 916 (1962). We are unwilling to ascribe to the Congress an intent to import, sub silentio, sentencing doctrine contrary to traditional powers of sentencing judges.\n\n\n15\n Judge Marvin E. Frankel (SDNY) has recently stated that while judges are required to explain other rulings, see, e.g., Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 52(a), '(t) here is no such requirement in the announcement of a prison sentence.' Frankel, Lawlessness in Sentencing, 41 U.Cin.L.Rev. 1, 9 (1972). It would have been a very simple matter for Congress to have included a statement in \u00a7 5010(d) that the sentencing court's determination of no benefit must be supported by reasons, as was required by the proposal regarding adult offenders, before the Congress in 1943, S. 895, Tit. II, \u00a7 1, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. See n. 8, supra. Congress' failure to so provide in \u00a7 5010(d) strengthens our view that it intended no new appellate encumbrance upon the sentencing process.\n\n\n1\n The actual duration of the treatment period is determined by the Youth Correction authorities. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5017.\n\n\n2\n H.R.Rep.

Kaylor, 491 F.2d 1133, 1136 (CA2 1974) (en banc); United States v. Waters, 141 U.S.App.D.C. 289, 293, 437 F.2d 722, 726 (1970); Carter v. United States, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 123, 125, 306 F.2d 283, 285 (1962).\n\n\n10\n Emulating the Borstal system, Congress authorized a comprehensive youth corrections system, making a wide range of treatment options available to youth offenders. It mandated that maximum, medium, and minimum security institutions be utilized, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5011, that long- and short-term treatment be provided, compare 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b) with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(c), and that a wide range of treatment services be available. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5011, 5015.\n\n\n11\n 'If the court desires additional information as to whether a youth offender will derive benefit from treatment under subsection (b) or (c) it may ordr that he be committed to the custody of the Attorney General for observation and study at an appropriate classification center or agency. Within sixty days from the date of the order, or such additional period as the court may grant, the Division shall report to the court its findings.' 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(e) (emphasis added).\n\n\n12\n An unsuccessful effort to remove these bonds on the discretion of sentencing judges was made in 1972, when a bill was introduced to amend 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(d) to provide that:\n'Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to preclude the court, in any case, from sentencing a youth offender under any other applicable penalty provision.' S. 3290, 92d 2d Sess (1972); see 118 Cong.Rec. 6776-6788 (1972).\n\n\n13\n The requirement of a positive finding of 'no benefit' to support an adult sentence under \u00a7 5010(d) is merely the obserse of the requirement of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4209 that as a prerequisite to young adult offender sentencing the sentencing 'court finds that there is reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant will benefit from (such) treatment . . ..' See United States v. Kayor, 491 F.2d, at 1137.\n\n\n14\n Subsequently in United States v. Walker, 469 F.2d 1377 (1972), the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit agreed that the Act precluded adult sentencing where the offender would derive benefit from treatment under the Act, but found it clear from the nature of the offenses involved that the defendant had no antisocial tendencies to be corrected, hence no benefit to be derived from YCA treatment. Id., at 1381 n. 4.\n\n\n15\n See Brooks v. United States, 497 F.2d 1059, 1062\u20141063 (CA6 1974); United States v. Kaylor, 491 F.2d, at 1139; United States v. Coefield, 155 U.S.App.D.C. 205, 210\u2014211, 476 F.2d 1152, 1157\u20141158 (1973) (en banc).\n\n\n16\n Criminal Justice Act of 1948, \u00a7 17(3), 11 & 12 Geo. 6, c. 58. The Court asserts, ante, at 440 n. 14, that the reference to the English Borstal system made in drafting the Act 'did not include the English view of the trial court's discretion to make use of that system.' To support this claim, the Court relies on two general descriptions of American sentencing procedures made a decade after enactment of the legislation. Those comments were not directed to the administration of the YCA, hence their validity as indicia of congressional intent in this limited context is questionable at best.\nOn the other hand, there is considerable evidence that the Borstal system did, in fact, provide a model on the question of the trial court's sentencing discretion, not the least of which is the marked similarity between 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(d) and the Criminal Justice Act of 1948, \u00a7 17(2), 11 & 12 Geo. 6, c. 58, both of which require a no-benefit finding as a prerequisite to adult sentencing.\n\n\n17\n Only Judge MacKinnon, of the 10 participating judges on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, dissented from that court's en banc decision in Coefield, supra.\n\n\n18\n The First Circuit in United States v. MacDonald, 455 F.2d 1259, 1265 (1972), remanded a case to the District Court 'to make the findings required by the Federal Youth Corrections Act,' leaving unclear whether those findings encompassed a statement of reasons. The Third Circuit specifically reserved the issue in Williams v. United States, 476 F.2d 970 (1973). The Fifth Circuit, in its only cae on the issue, remanded for appropriate findings under \u00a7 5010(d) without explanation as to whether an ultimate finding of no benefit was alone sufficient. United States v. Schenker, 486 F.2d 318 (1973). A case specifically dealing with the reasons requirement, Hoyt v. United States, No. 73\u20142435, is presently pending before the Fifth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit called for an express no-benefit finding but has not faced the question of whether reasons are required in support thereof. United States v. Jarratt, 471 F.2d 226 (1972).\n\n\n19\n A leading federal district judge has observed that '(t)he absence of any explanation or purported justification for the sentence is among the more familiar and understandable sources of bitterness among people in prison.' M. Frankel, Criminal Sentences, Law Without Order 42\u201443 (1972).\n\n\n20\n There may, of course, be circumstances in which it would not be advisable to state the reasons underlying imposition of a particular sentence in the presence of the defendant, in which case those reasons could instead be committed to writing and made part of the record.\n\n\n21\n American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Appellate Review of Sentences 2\u20143 (Approved Draft 1968).\n\n\n22\n For a general discussion of the value of a statement of the reasons underlying the imposition of sentence, see United States v.

Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915, he applied to the District Court for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. Petitioner, who was assisted by court-appointed counsel in preparing his application, contended that the evidence was insufficient to justify his conviction and that the trial court had committed reversible error by permitting the United States Attorney to ask him irrelevant and prejudicial questions about another criminal offense. Petitioner requested that the District Court make available a transcript of the trial record so he could substantiate his claimed errors. In reply the United States Attorney filed an affidavit asserting that the evidence was sufficient to sustain petitioner's conviction. However, the affidavit did not directly controvert petitioner's claim that the prosecuting attorney had been allowed to inject irrelevant and prejudicial matter into the trial. Counsel for petitioner then filed an affidavit in answer supporting petitioner's allegation of errors.\n\n\n3\nThe District Court refused the request for a transcript of the trial record and denied the application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis on the ground that the appeal was 'not taken in good faith' because it was 'frivolous and without merit' and '(t)he evidence amply supported the verdict.' Petitioner then asked the Court of Appeals for permission to appeal in forma pauperis but that court denied his request indicating that his claimed errors were without substance. 2 Cir., 242 F.2d 338. And see 2 Cir., 238 F.2d 575.\n\n\n4\nAs things now stand conflicting affidavits have been introduced concerning petitioner's contention of errors at the trial. If the allegations made by petitioner and his counsel are correct then it seems quite clear to us that his appeal cannot be characterized as frivolous. Before his allegation of errors can be accurately evaluated, however, to ascertain if they do have any merit he should be furnished with a transcript of the trial record unless counsel can agree on a statement of the relevant facts or some other means are devised to make the minutes of the trial available to petitioner\u2014so that he has an opportunity to substantiate his allegations and point out their significance and so that they can be appraised on a dependable record. Cf. Johnson v. United States, 352 U.S. 565, 77 S.Ct. 550, 1 L.Ed.2d 593. In our judgment petitioner has not yet been afforded an adequate opportunity to show the Court of Appeals that his claimed errors are not frivolous so as to enable that court to review properly the District Court's certification that the appeal was in bad faith. Accordingly the judgment below must be vacated and the case remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n5\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n6\nMr. Justice CLARK and Mr. Justice HARLAN dissent.\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"454 U.S. 6\n102 S.Ct. 28\n70 L.Ed.2d 6\nCarlos CHARDON, Individually, et al.v.Rafael Rivera FERNANDEZ et al.*\nNo. 81-249.\nNov. 2, 1981.\nRehearing Denied Jan. 11, 1982.\n\nSee 454 U.S. 1166, 102 S.Ct. 1042.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nRespondents were nontenured administrators in the Puerto Rico Department of Education during the 1976-1977 school year.1  On dates prior to June 18, 1977, each respondent was notified by letter that his appointment would terminate at a specified date between June 30 and August 8, 1977.  On June 19, 1978, Rafael Rivera Fernandez filed a complaint alleging that the terminations violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.  The District Court dismissed the suit, holding that the action had accrued on the date the employees received the letters and that the claims were therefore barred by the applicable 1-year statute of limitations, P.R. Laws Ann., Tit. 31, \u00a7 5298(2) (1968).  The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed on the ground that the limitations period did not begin running until respondents' appointments ended.  648 F.2d 765 (1981).\n\n\n2\nThe decision below is contrary to a recent decision of this Court:  Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 101 S.Ct. 498, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980).  In that case, Ricks filed suit alleging that the denial of tenure at a state college deprived him of his rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq., and under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981.  And we held that the applicable limitations periods began to run when Ricks was denied tenure, rather than on the date his employment terminated.  His action was, therefore, time-barred.\n\n\n3\nThe Court of Appeals for the First Circuit distinguished Ricks on the ground that Ricks had alleged that denial of tenure was the \"unlawful employment practice,\" whereas here respondents allege that termination of their employment as administrators was the \"unlawful employment practice.\" We think Ricks is indistinguishable.  When Ricks was denied tenure, he was given a 1-year \"terminal\" contract.  Thus, in each case, the operative decision was made\u2014and notice given\u2014in advance of a designated date on which employment terminated.2\n\n\n4\nIn Ricks, we held that the proper focus is on the time of the discriminatory act, not the point at which the consequences of the act become painful.  449 U.S., at 258, 101 S.Ct., at 504.  The fact of termination is not itself an illegal act.  In Ricks, the alleged illegal act was racial discrimination in the tenure decision.  Id., at 259, 101 S.Ct., at 504.  Here, respondents allege that the decision to terminate was made solely for political reasons, violative of First Amendment rights.  There were no other allegations, either in Ricks or in these cases, of illegal acts subsequent to the date on which the decisions to terminate were made.  As we noted in Ricks, \"[m]ere continuity of employment, without more, is insufficient to prolong the life of a cause of action for employment discrimination.\"  Id., at 257, 101 S.Ct., at 504.  In the cases at bar, respondents were notified, when they received their letters, that a final decision had been made to terminate their appointments.  The fact that they were afforded reasonable notice cannot extend the period within which suit must be filed.  We therefore grant certiorari.  The judgments entered below on May 8, 1981, and June 11, 1981, are reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n\n\n5\nReversed and remanded.    Justice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting.\n\n\n6\nWhile I agree with the analysis of Judge Campbell for the Court of Appeals, and therefore join in the dissenting opinion of Justice STEVENS, I believe this per curiam disposition is particularly ill-conceived.\n\n\n7\nIt is one thing to hold, as was held in Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 101 S.Ct. 498, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980), that for the purpose of computing the limitations period, a cause of action for denial of a benefit such as tenure, and consequent damage, accrues when the plaintiff learns that he has been denied that benefit;  it is quite another to hold, as the Court does here, that a cause of action for damages resulting from an unconstitutional termination of employment accrues when the plaintiff learns that he will be terminated.  To my knowledge, such a rule has no analogue in customary principles of limitations law.  See 4 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 989 (1951) (\"The plaintiff should not be penalized for leaving to the defendant an opportunity to retract his wrongful repudiation;  and he would be so penalized if the statutory period of limitation is held to begin to run against him immediately\").\n\n\n8\nThe thrust of the Court's decision is to require a potential civil rights plaintiff to measure the time for filing his claim from the moment some form of injunctive relief first becomes available.  The effect of this ruling will be to increase the number of unripe and anticipatory lawsuits in the federal courts lawsuits that should not be filed until some concrete harm has been suffered, and until the parties, and the forces of time, have had maximum opportunity to resolve the controversy.\n\n\n9\nBecause this case is plainly distinguishable from Ricks, and the decision potentially far-reaching in its impact, the issue should be decided only upon plenary review.  The Court's summary reversal is therefore particularly inappropriate, and I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n10\nJustice STEVENS, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting.\n\n\n11\nAfter noting that most judges who have confronted the issue have reached a conclusion at odds with the Court's holding today, Judge Campbell, writing for the Court of Appeals, cogently explained why the decision in Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 101 S.Ct. 498, 66 L.Ed.2d 431, is not dispositive and should not be followed in this case:\n\n\n12\n\"The issue of when the cause of action accrues depends,      we believe, on when the alleged unlawful act occurred.  It is      necessary, therefore, to identify the unlawful act.  Where,      as here, the claim is that an employment decision was made      for a prohibited reason, it could be argued that the unlawful      act was the making of the decision, rather than the      implementation of it.  But we think such a refined rule would      depart too sharply from the understanding of ordinary people.      The plaintiffs in these cases are complaining that they were      demoted or discharged, not merely that a decision was made on      a particular occasion, of which notice was then given, to      take such action against them.  Had the decision been made      but not yet implemented, equitable relief might have been      sought to forestall irreparable harm, but it is unlikely that      plaintiffs would have sought or received damages until or      unless the threatened action was consummated.  The alleged      unlawful act was revocable, incomplete and, for practical      purposes, non-existent until the actual demotion or      discharge.\n\n\n13\n\"Moreover, important policies of judicial administration      favor a rule based on the date of implementation.  While the      date of notice in the present cases was easily established,      other cases would surely arise in which resolution of that      question would require lengthy proceedings.  Notice might be      oral, or it might be ambiguously phrased, or it might be      transmitted by one whose authority is subject to question.  We see no value in requiring      courts and parties to devote their resources to litigating      the adequacy of notice, when the date of the action itself is      easily determined.  In saying this we are aware that the      Supreme Court has declined to reach out for an easily      identified date when that date bears no genuine relationship      to the act of which plaintiff complains.  Compare Delaware      State College v. Ricks [449 U.S. 250, 101 S.Ct. 498, 66      L.Ed.2d 431] (1980) (date of termination not sufficiently      connected to the challenged denial of tenure), discussed      infra.  But where, as here, the date that is most closely      related to the plaintiffs' claim is also the date most easily      identified, we think concern for adoption of the rule that      best promotes certainty and eliminates litigation over      technical niceties is well warranted.\n\n\n14\n\"After the district court's decision of these cases, the      Supreme Court decided Delaware State College v. Ricks, supra.      Defendants contend that that decision compels affirmance      here.  We disagree.  Ricks, a black Liberian instructor, was      informed in June 1974 that the faculty of Delaware State      College had voted to deny him tenure.  In accordance with the      school's usual practice, he was thereafter granted a one-year      terminal contract, after which his employment with the school      ended.  In his suit alleging discrimination on the basis of      national origin, Ricks contended that the limitations period      under Title VII began to run only when he left the university      in June 1975.  The Supreme Court rejected this argument and      concluded that Ricks' cause of action had accrued when he was      notified of the denial of tenure, in June 1974, and that his      suit was therefore barred.  The Court focussed on the      allegations of Ricks' complaint, which it found to charge      discrimination in the denial of tenure, not in the discharge      or any other subsequent action.  The Court held that the      denial of tenure was the 'unlawful employment practice'      within the meaning of Title VII, and that the date of that action was therefore the      beginning of the limitations period.  Three justices, in      dissent, accepted the majority's analysis (i. e., that denial      of tenure, not discharge, was the unlawful employment      practice) but placed the denial of tenure at a later date      because of the later decision of an internal grievance board.      Justice Stevens, alone among the justices, took the view that      denial of tenure is analogous to advance notice of discharge.      Based on that analogy, he argued that the date of discharge      should control.\n\n\n15\n\"Refusal of the Ricks majority to adopt Justice Stevens'      analogy does not seem to us in any way to repudiate the      precedents to which he sought to draw an analogy.  The      majority held merely that the denial of tenure in the      academic setting is fundamentally different from a notice of      discharge;  it is a distinct and separate employment action,      with important and far-reaching consequences for all aspects      of the employee's status.  While denial of tenure is often      followed by discharge, it is not always, and the consequences      of denial of tenure are not dependent on its being followed      by discharge.  The Court found that Ricks' complaint was      based on the denial of tenure, which was effective      immediately;  it followed, therefore, that the limitations      period began as soon as Ricks received notice of that action.      Here, plaintiffs complain of discharges and demotions, not of      any distinct event that occurred on an earlier date.  The      letters notifying them of the planned actions were notice and      nothing more;  they were not actions in themselves comparable      to the denial of tenure.\n\n\n16\n\"To be sure, as we have said, one can argue that the      notices themselves mirror the allegedly discriminatory      motives of the defendants.  One can also argue that a suit      for injunctive relief might lie after receipt of notice (or,      indeed, even before) to forestall threatened irreparable      harm.  Still plaintiffs' quarrel is with their demotions and discharges\u2014not with the notices themselves.  No      actual harm is done until the threatened action is      consummated.  Until then, the act which is the central focus      of the plaintiffs' claim remains incomplete.  Such was not      the situation in Ricks, where the denial of tenure was itself      the completed act being challenged.\n\n\n17\n\"We conclude, therefore, that Ricks is inapplicable to      these cases, and that the district court erred in dismissing      the complaints.\"  648 F.2d 765, 768-770 (CA1 1981) (footnotes      omitted).\n\n\n18\nFor the reasons stated by the Court of Appeals, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n*\n Together with Chardon, Secretary of Public Education of Puerto Rico, et al. v.

Navarro, also on petition for certiorari to the same court (see this Court's Rule 19.4).\n\n\n1\n Petitioners request a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit to review a total of 14 judgments entered in favor of 36 respondents.  The published decision, discussed in text, represents one judgment in a suit brought by 23 respondents;  that decision was issued May 8, 1981.  See 648 F.2d 765 (1981).  Identical individual judgments in favor of the other 13 respondents were issued on June 11, 1981.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 11a (unpublished orders).\n\n\n2\n Delaware State College had a policy of giving a final 1-year contract to teachers who were denied tenure.  Only when that contract expired, did the \"employment relationship en[d].\" 449 U.S., at 253, 101 S.Ct., at 501.  Apparently, the practice of the Puerto Rico Department of Education was similar in principle. Following a decision to terminate, the actual ending of employment was deferred to a designated date.  Advance notice of termination is a customary and reasonable employment practice which affords the employee an opportunity to find another job.\n\n\n","label":1}

TERRAZAS.\nNo. 78-1143.\nArgued Oct. 30, 1979.\nDecided Jan. 15, 1980.\nRehearing Denied March 3, 1980.\n\nSee 445 U.S. 920, 100 S.Ct. 1285.\n\nSyllabus\n\nSection 349(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act provides that \"a person who is a national of the United States whether by birth or naturalization, shall lose his nationality by . . .  taking an oath or making an affirmation or other formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state or a political subdivision thereof.\"  Section 349(c) provides that the party claiming that such loss of citizenship occurred must \"establish such claim by a preponderance of the evidence\" and that a person who commits any act of expatriation \"shall be presumed to have done so voluntarily, but such presumption may be rebutted upon a showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the act or acts committed or performed were not done voluntarily.\"  Appellee, who was a citizen of both the United States and Mexico at birth, subsequently obtained a certificate of Mexican citizenship after executing an application in which he swore allegiance to Mexico and expressly renounced his United States citizenship. Thereafter, the Department of State issued a certificate of loss of nationality, and the Board of Appellate Review of the Department of State affirmed.  Appellee then brought suit for a declaration of his United States nationality, but the District Court concluded that the United States had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that appellee had knowingly and voluntarily taken an oath of allegiance to Mexico and renounced allegiance to the United States, thus voluntarily relinquishing United States citizenship pursuant to \u00a7 349(a)(2).  The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that Congress had no power to legislate the evidentiary standard contained in \u00a7 349(c) and that the Constitution required that proof be not merely by a preponderance of the evidence, but by \"clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence.\"\nHeld:\n1. In establishing loss of citizenship, the Government must prove an intent to surrender United States citizenship, not just the voluntary commission of an expatriating act such as swearing allegiance to a foreign nation.  Congress does not have any general power to take away an American citizen's citizenship without his \"assent,\" which means an intent to relinquish citizenship, whether the intent is expressed in words or is found as a fair inference from his conduct.  The expatriating acts specified in \u00a7 349(a) cannot be treated as conclusive evidence of the indispensable voluntary assent of the citizen.  The trier of fact must in the end conclude that the citizen not only voluntarily committed the expatriating act prescribed in the statute, but also intended to relinquish his citizenship.  Cf. Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253, 87 S.Ct. 1660, 18 L.Ed.2d 757.  Pp. 258-263.\n2. However, the Constitution permits Congress to prescribe the standard of proof in expatriation proceedings.  The specific evidentiary standard provided in \u00a7 349(c) is not invalid under either the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Although the Due Process Clause imposes requirements of proof beyond a preponderance of the evidence in criminal and involuntary commitment contexts, nevertheless expatriation proceedings are civil in nature and do not threaten a loss of liberty, and thus Congress did not exceed its powers by requiring proof of an intentional expatriating act by only a preponderance of evidence. Pp. 264-267.\n3. Nor is the presumption of voluntariness provided in \u00a7 349(c) constitutionally infirm.  While the statute provides that any of the statutory expatriating acts, if proved, is presumed to have been committed voluntarily, it does not also direct a presumption that the act has been performed with the intent to relinquish United States citizenship, which matter remains the burden of the party claiming expatriation to prove by a preponderance of the evidence.  Section 349(c) and its legislative history make clear that Congress preferred the ordinary rule that voluntariness of an act is presumed and that duress is an affirmative defense to be proved by the party asserting it, and to invalidate the rule here would give the Citizenship Clause far more scope in this context than the relevant circumstances that brought the Fourteenth Amendment into being would suggest appropriate.  Pp. 267-270.\n577 F.2d 7, reversed and remanded.\nAllan A. Ryan, Jr., Washington, D. C., for appellant.\nKenneth K. Ditkowsky, Chicago, Ill., for appellee.\nMr. Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nSection 349(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), 66 Stat. 267, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(a)(2), provides that \"a person who is a national of the United States whether by birth or naturalization, shall lose his nationality by  . . .  taking an oath or making an affirmation or other formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state or a political subdivision thereof.\" The Act also provides that the party claiming that such loss of citizenship occurred must \"establish such claim by a preponderance of the evidence\" and that the voluntariness of the expatriating conduct is rebuttably presumed.  \u00a7 349(c), as added, 75 Stat. 656, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(c).1  The issues in this case are whether, in establishing loss of citizenship under \u00a7 1481(a)(2), a party must prove an intent to surrender United States citizenship and whether the United States Constitution permits Congress to legislate with respect to expatriation proceedings by providing the standard of proof and the statutory presumption contained in \u00a7 1481(c).\n\n\n2\n* Appellee, Laurence J. Terrazas, was born in this country, the son of a Mexican citizen.  He thus acquired at birth both United States and Mexican citizenship.  In the fall of 1970, while a student in Monterrey, Mexico, and at the age of 22, appellee executed an application for a certificate of Mexican nationality, swearing \"adherence, obedience, and submission to the laws and authorities of the Mexican Republic\" and \"expressly renounc[ing] United States citizenship, as well as any submission, obedience, and loyalty to any foreign government, especially to that of the United States of America,  . . .\"  App. to Brief for Appellant 5a.2  The certificate, which issued upon this application on April 3, 1971, recited that Terrazas had sworn adherence to the United Mexican States and that he \"has expressly renounced all rights inherent to any other nationality, as well as all submission, obedience, and loyalty to any foreign government, especially to those which have recognized him as that national.\"  Id., at 8a.  Terrazas read and understood the certificate upon receipt.  App. to Juris. Statement 21a.\n\n\n3\nA few months later, following a discussion with an officer of the United States Consulate in Monterrey, proceedings were instituted to determine whether appellee had lost his United States citizenship by obtaining the certificate of Mexican nationality.  Appellee denied that he had, but in December 1971 the Department of State issued a certificate of loss of nationality.  App. to Brief for Appellant 31a.  The Board of Appellate Review of the Department of State, after a full hearing, affirmed that appellee had voluntarily renounced his United States citizenship.  Juris. Statement 31a.  As permitted by \u00a7 360(a) of the Act, 66 Stat. 273, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503(a), appellee then brought this suit against the Secretary of State for a declaration of his United States nationality.  Trial was de novo.\n\n\n4\nThe District Court recognized that the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment,3 as construed in Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253, 268, 87 S.Ct. 1660, 1668, 18 L.Ed.2d 757 (1967), \" 'protect[s] every citizen of this Nation against a congressional forcible destruction of his citizenship' \" and that every citizen has \" 'a constitutional right to remain a citizen  . . .  unless he voluntarily relinquishes that citizenship.' \"  App. to Juris. Statement 25a.  A person of dual nationality, the District Court said, \"will be held to have expatriated himself from the United States when it is shown that he voluntarily committed an act whereby he unequivocally renounced his allegiance to the United States.\"  Ibid.  Specifically, the District Court found that appellee had taken an oath of allegiance to Mexico, that he had \"knowingly and understandingly renounced allegiance to the United States in connection with his Application for a Certificate of Mexican Nationality,\" id., at 28a, and that \"[t]he taking of an oath of allegiance to Mexico and renunciation of a foreign country [sic ] citizenship is a condition precedent under Mexican law to the issuance of a Certificate of Mexican Nationality.\" Ibid.  The District Court concluded that the United States had \"proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Laurence J. Terrazas knowingly, understandingly and voluntarily took an oath of allegiance to Mexico, and concurrently renounced allegiance to the United States,\" id., at 29a, and that he had therefore \"voluntarily relinquished United States citizenship pursuant to \u00a7 349(a)(2) of the . . . Act.\"  Ibid.\n\n\n5\nIn its opinion accompanying its findings and conclusions, the District Court observed that appellee had acted \"voluntarily in swearing allegiance to Mexico and renouncing allegiance to the United States,\" id., at 25a, and that appellee \"knew he was repudiating allegiance to the United States through his actions.\" Ibid.  The court also said, relying upon and quoting from United States v. Matheson, 400 F.Supp. 1241, 1245 (S.D.N.Y.1975), aff'd, 532 F.2d 809 (CA2), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 823, 97 S.Ct. 75, 50 L.Ed.2d 185 (1976), that \"the declaration of allegiance to a foreign state in conjunction with the renunciatory language of United States citizenship 'would leave no room for ambiguity as to the intent of the applicant.' \"  App. to Juris. Statement 23a.\n\n\n6\nThe Court of Appeals reversed.  577 F.2d 7 (1978).  As the Court of Appeals understood the law\u2014and there appears to have been no dispute on these basic requirements in the Courts of Appeals the United States had not only to prove the taking of an oath to a foreign state, but also to demonstrate an intent on appellee's part to renounce his United States citizenship.  The District Court had found these basic elements to have been proved by a preponderance of the evidence;  and the Court of Appeals observed that, \"[a]ssuming that the proper [evidentiary] standards were applied, we are convinced that the record fully supports the court's findings.\"  Id., at 10.  The Court of Appeals ruled, however, that under Afroyim v. Rusk, supra, Congress had no power to legislate the evidentiary standard contained in \u00a7 1481(c) and that the Constitution required that proof be not merely by a preponderance of the evidence, but by \"clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence.\"  577 F.2d, at 11.  The case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.4\n\n\n7\nThe Secretary took this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Because the invalidation of \u00a7 1481(c) posed a substantial constitutional issue, we noted probable jurisdiction.  440 U.S. 970, 99 S.Ct. 1532, 59 L.Ed.2d 786.\n\nII\n\n8\nThe Secretary first urges that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that a \"specific intent to renounce U. S. citizenship\" must be proved \"before the mere taking of an oath of allegiance could result in an individual's expatriation.\"  577 F.2d, at 11.5 His position is that he need prove only the voluntary commission of an act, such as swearing allegiance to a foreign nation, that \"is so inherently inconsistent with the continued retention of American citizenship that Congress may accord to it its natural consequences, i. e., loss of nationality.\"  Brief for Appellant 24.  We disagree.\n\n\n9\nIn Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253, 87 S.Ct. 1660, 18 L.Ed.2d 757 (1967), the Court held that \u00a7 401(e) of the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1168-1169, which provided that an American citizen \"shall lose his nationality by  . . .  [v]oting in a political election in a foreign state,\" contravened the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Afroyim was a naturalized American citizen who lived in Israel for 10 years.  While in that nation, Afroyim voted in a political election.  He in consequence was stripped of his United States citizenship.  Consistently with Perez v. Brownell, 356 U.S. 44, 78 S.Ct. 568, 2 L.Ed.2d 603 (1958), which had sustained \u00a7 401(e), the District Court affirmed the power of Congress to expatriate for such conduct regardless of the citizen's intent to renounce his citizenship.  This Court, however, in overruling Perez, \"reject[ed] the idea  . . .  that, aside from the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress has any general power, express or implied, to take away an American citizen's citizenship without his assent.\"   Afroyim v. Rusk, supra, 387 U.S., at 257, 87 S.Ct., at 1662.  The Afroyim opinion continued:  \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment is \"most reasonably  . . .  read as defining a citizenship which a citizen keeps unless he voluntarily relinquishes it.\"  387 U.S., at 262, 87 S.Ct., at 1665.\n\n\n10\nThe Secretary argues that Afroyim does not stand for the proposition that a specific intent to renounce must be shown before citizenship is relinquished.  It is enough, he urges, to establish one of the expatriating acts specified in \u00a7 1481(a) because Congress has declared each of those acts to be inherently inconsistent with the retention of citizenship.  But Afroyim emphasized that loss of citizenship requires the individual's \"assent,\" 387 U.S., at 257, 87 S.Ct., at 1662, in addition to his voluntary commission of the expatriating act.  It is difficult to understand that \"assent\" to loss of citizenship would mean anything less than an intent to relinquish citizenship, whether the intent is expressed in words or is found as a fair inference from proved conduct.   Perez had sustained congressional power to expatriate without regard to the intent of the citizen to surrender his citizenship.  Afroyim overturned this proposition. It may be, as the Secretary maintains, that a requirement of intent to relinquish citizenship poses substantial difficulties for the Government in performance of its essential task of determining who is a citizen.  Nevertheless, the intent of the Fourteenth Amendment, among other things, was to define citizenship;  and as interpreted in Afroyim, that definition cannot coexist with a congressional power to specify acts that work a renunciation of citizenship even absent an intent to renounce.  In the last analysis, expatriation depends on the will of the citizen rather than on the will of Congress and its assessment of his conduct.\n\n\n11\nThe Secretary argues that the dissent in Perez, which it is said the Court's opinion in Afroyim adopted, spoke of conduct o contrary to undivided allegiance to this country that it could result in loss of citizenship without regard to the intent of the actor and that \"assent\" should not therefore be read as a code word for intent to renounce.  But Afroyim is a majority opinion, and its reach is neither expressly nor implicitly limited to that of the dissent in Perez.  Furthermore, in his Perez dissent, Mr. Chief Justice Warren, in speaking of those acts that were expatriating because so fundamentally inconsistent with citizenship, concluded by saying that in such instances the \"Government is simply giving formal recognition to the inevitable consequence of the citizen's own voluntary surrender of his citizenship.\"  Perez v. Brownell, supra, 356 U.S., at 69, 78 S.Ct., at 581.  This suggests that the Chief Justice's conception of \"actions in derogation of undivided allegiance to this country,\" 356 U.S., at 68, 78 S.Ct., at 581, in fact would entail an element of assent.\n\n\n12\nIn any event, we are confident that it would be inconsistent with Afroyim to treat the expatriating acts specified in \u00a7 1481(a) as the equivalent of or as conclusive evidence of the indispensable voluntary assent of the citizen.  \"Of course,\" any of the specified acts \"may be highly persuasive evidence in the particular case of a purpose to abandon citizenship.\"  Nishikawa v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 129, 139, 78 S.Ct. 612, 618, 2 L.Ed.2d 659 (1958) (Black, J., concurring).  But the trier of fact must in the end conclude that the citizen not only voluntarily committed the expatriating act prescribed in the statute, but also intended to relinquish his citizenship.\n\n\n13\nThis understanding of Afroyim is little different from that expressed by the Attorney General in his 1969 opinion explaining the impact of that case.  42 Op.Atty.Gen. 397.  An \"act which does not reasonably manifest an individual's transfer or abandonment of allegiance to the United States,\" the Attorney General said, \"cannot be made a basis for expatriation.\"  Id., at 400. Voluntarily relinquishment is \"not confined to a written renunciation,\" but \"can also be manifested by other actions declared expatriative under the [A]ct, if such actions are in derogation of allegiance to this country.\" Ibid.  Even in these cases, however, the issue of intent was deemed by the Attorney General to be open;  and, once raised, the burden of proof on the issue was on the party asserting that expatriation had occurred.  Ibid.  \"In each case,\" the Attorney General stated, \"the administrative authorities must make a judgment, based on all the evidence, whether the individual comes within the terms of an expatriation provision and has in fact voluntarily relinquished his citizenship.\"  Id., at 401.  It was under this advice, as the Secretary concedes, that the relevant departments of the Government have applied the statute and the Constitution to require an ultimate finding of an intent to expatriate.  Brief for Appellant 56-57, n. 28.6\n\n\n14\nAccordingly, in the case now before us, the Board of Appellate Review of the State Department found that appellee not only swore allegiance to Mexico, but also intended to abandon his United States citizenship:  \"In consideration of the complete record, we view appellant's declaration of allegiance to Mexico and his concurrent repudiation of any and all submission, obedience, and loyalty to the United States as compelling evidence of a specific intent to relinquish his United States citizenship.\" Juris. Statement 50a.  This same view\u2014that expatriation depends on the will of a citizen as ascertained from his words and conduct was also reflected in the United States' response to the petition for certiorari in United States v. Matheson, 532 F.2d 809, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 823, 97 S.Ct. 75, 50 L.Ed.2d 185 (1976).7 Insofar as we are advised, this view remained the official position of the United States until the appeal in this case.\n\n\n15\nAs we have said, Afroyim requires that the record support a finding that the expatriating act was accompanied by an intent to terminate United States citizenship.  The submission of the United States is inconsistent with this holding, and we are unprepared to reconsider it.\n\nIII\n\n16\nWith respect to the principal issues before it, the Court of Appeals held that Congress was without constitutional authority to prescribe the standard of proof in expatriation proceedings and that the proof in such cases must be by clear and convincing evidence rather than by the preponderance standard prescribed in \u00a7 1481(c).  We are in fundamental disagreement with these conclusions.\n\n\n17\nIn Nishikawa v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 129, 78 S.Ct. 612, 2 L.Ed.2d 659 (1958), an American-born citizen, temporarily in Japan, was drafted into the Japanese Army.  The Government later claimed that, under \u00a7 401(c) of the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1169, he had expatriated himself by serving in the armed forces of a foreign nation.  The Government agreed that expatriation had not occurred if Nishikawa's army service had been involuntary. Nishikawa contended that the Government had to prove that his service was voluntary, while the Government urged that duress was an affirmative defense that Nishikawa had the burden to prove by overcoming the usual presumption of voluntariness.  This Court held the presumption unavailable to the Government and required proof of a voluntary expatriating act by clear and convincing evidence.\n\n\n18\nSection 1481(c) soon followed;  its evident aim was to supplant the evidentiary standards prescribed by Nishikawa.8 The provision \"sets up rules of evidence under which the burden of proof to establish loss of citizenship by preponderance of the evidence would rest upon the Government.  The presumption of voluntariness under the proposed rules of evidence, would be rebuttable\u2014similarly\u2014by preponderance of the evidence,  . . . \" H.R.Rep. No. 1086, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 41, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, p. 2985 (1961).\n\n\n19\nWe see no basis for invalidating the evidentiary prescriptions contained in \u00a7 1481(c).  Nishikawa was not rooted in the Constitution.  The Court noted, moreover, that it was acting in the absence of legislative guidance.  Nishikawa v. Dulles, 356 U.S., at 135, 78 S.Ct., at 616.  Nor do we agree with the Court of Appeals that, because under Afroyim Congress is constitutionally devoid of power to impose expatriation on a citizen, it is also without power to prescribe the evidentiary standards to govern expatriation proceedings.  577 F.2d, at 10.  Although \u00a7 1481(c) had been law since 1961, Afroyim did not address or advert to that section;  surely the Court would have said so had it intended to construe the Constitution to exclude expatriation proceedings from the traditional powers of Congress to prescribe rules of evidence and standards of proof in the federal courts.  This power, rooted in the authority of Congress conferred by Art. 1, \u00a7 8, cl. 9, of the Constitution to create inferior federal courts, is undoubted and has been frequently noted and sustained.  See, e. g., Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S. 1, 31, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 2899, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976);  Hawkins v. United States, 358 U.S. 74, 78, 79 S.Ct. 136, 138, 3 L.Ed.2d 125 (1958);  Tot v. United States, 319 U.S. 463, 467, 63 S.Ct. 1241, 1244, 87 L.Ed. 1519 (1943).\n\n\n20\nWe note also that the Court's opinion in Afroyim was written by Mr. Justice Black who, in concurring in Nishikawa, said that the question whether citizenship has been voluntarily relinquished is to be determined on the facts of each case and that Congress could provide rules of evidence for such proceedings.  Nishikawa v. Dulles, supra, 356 U.S., at 139, 78 S.Ct., at 618.  In this respect, we agree with Mr. Justice Black;  and since Congress has the express power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, it is untenable to hold that it has no power whatsoever to address itself to the manner or means by which Fourteenth Amendment citizenship may be relinquished.\n\n\n21\nWe are unable to conclude that the specific evidentiary standard provided by Congress in \u00a7 1481(c) is invalid under either the Citizenship Clause or the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  It is true that in criminal and involuntary commitment contexts we have held that the Due Process Clause imposes requirements of proof beyond a preponderance of the evidence. Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975);  Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979).  This Court has also stressed the importance of citizenship and evinced a decided preference for requiring clear and convincing evidence to prove expatriation.  Nishikawa v. United States, supra.  But expatriation proceedings are civil in nature and do not threaten a loss of liberty.  Moreover, as we have noted, Nishikawa did not purport to be constitutional ruling, and the same is true of similar rulings in related areas.  Woodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276, 285, 87 S.Ct. 483, 487, 17 L.Ed.2d 362 (1966) (deportation);  Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U.S. 118, 125, 63 S.Ct. 1333, 1336, 87 L.Ed. 1779 (1943) (denaturalization).  None of these cases involved a congressional judgment, such as that present here, that the preponderance standard of proof provides sufficient protection for the interest of the individual in retaining his citizenship.  Contrary to the Secretary's position, we have held that expatriation requires the ultimate finding that the citizen has committed the expatriating act with the intent to renounce his citizenship.  This in itself is a heavy burden, and we cannot hold that Congress has exceeded its powers by requiring proof of an intentional expatriating act by a preponderance of evidence.\n\nIV\n\n22\nThe Court of Appeals did not discuss separately the validity of the statutory presumption provided in \u00a7 1481(c).  By holding that the section was beyond the power of Congress, however, and by requiring that the expatriating act be proved voluntary by clear and convincing evidence, the Court of Appeals effectively foreclosed use of the \u00a7 1481(c) presumption of voluntariness, not only in the remand proceedings in the District Court, but also in other expatriation proceedings in that Circuit.  As we have indicated, neither the Citizenship Clause nor Afroyim places suits as this wholly beyond the accepted power of Congress to prescribe rules of evidence in federal courts.  We also conclude that the presumption of voluntariness provided in \u00a7 1481(c) is not otherwise constitutionally infirm.\n\n\n23\nSection 1481(c) provides in relevant part that \"any person who commits or performs, or who has committed or performed, any act of expatriation under the provisions of this chapter or any other Act shall be presumed to have done so voluntarily, but such presumption may be rebutted upon a showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the act or acts committed or performed were not done voluntarily.\"  In enacting \u00a7 1481(c), Congress did not dispute the holding of Nishikawa that the alleged expatriating act there, service in a foreign army\u2014must be performed voluntarily, but it did insist that the Government have the benefit of the usual presumption of voluntariness and that one claiming that his act was involuntary make out his claim of duress by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n\n24\nIt is important at this juncture to note the scope of the statutory presumption.  Section 1481(c) provides that any of the statutory expatriating acts, if proved, are presumed to have been committed voluntarily.  It does not also direct a presumption that the act has been performed with the intent to relinquish United States citizenship.  That matter remains the burden of the party claiming expatriation to prove by a preponderance of the evidence. As so understood, we cannot invalidate the provision.9\n\n\n25\nThe majority opinion in Nishikawa referred to the \"ordinary rule that duress is a matter of affirmative defense\" to be proved by the party claiming the duress.  Nishikawa v. Dulles, 356 U.S., at 134, 78 S.Ct., at 616.  Justices Frankfurter and Burton, concurring in the result, also referred to the \"ordinarily controlling principles of evidence [that] would suggest that the individual, who is peculiarly equipped to clarify an ambiguity in the meaning of outward events should have the burden of proving what his state of mind was.\"  Id., at 141, 78 S.Ct., at 619.  And Mr. Justice Harlan, in dissent with Mr. Justice Clark, pointed to the \"general rule that consciously performed acts are presumed voluntary\" and referred to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c), which treats duress as a matter of affirmative defense.  356 U.S., at 144, 78 S.Ct., at 621.  Yet the Court in Nishikawa, because it decided that \"the consequences of denationalization are so drastic\" and because it found nothing indicating a contrary result in the legislative history of the Nationality Act of 1940, held that the Government must carry the burden of proving that the expatriating act was performed voluntarily.  Id., at 133-138, 78 S.Ct., at 615-617.10\n\n\n26\nSection 1481(c), which was enacted subsequently, and its legislative history, H.R.Rep. No. 1086, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., at 40-41 (1961), make clear that Congress preferred the ordinary rule that voluntariness is presumed and that duress is an affirmative defense to be proved by the party asserting it.  SeeHartsville Oil Mill v. United States, 271 U.S. 43, 49-50, 46 S.Ct. 389, 391-392, 70 L.Ed. 822 (1926);  Towson v. Moore, 173 U.S. 17, 23-24, 19 S.Ct. 332, 334, 43 L.Ed. 597 (1899);  Savage v. United States, 92 U.S. 382, 387-388, 23 L.Ed. 660 (1876).  \"Duress, if proved, may be a defence to an action  . . .  but the burden of proof to establish the charge  . . .  is upon the party making it.  . . .\" Mason v. United States, 17 Wall. 67, 74, 21 L.Ed. 564 (1873).11 The rationality of the procedural rule with respect to claims of involuntariness in ordinary civil cases cannot be doubted.  To invalidate the rule here would be to disagree flatly with Congress on the balance to be struck between the interest in citizenship and the burden the Government must assume in demonstrating expatriating conduct.  It would also constitutionalize that disagreement and give the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment far more scope in this context than the relevant circumstances that brought the Amendment into being would suggest appropriate.  Thus we conclude that the presumption of voluntariness included in \u00a7 1481(c) has continuing vitality.\n\nV\n\n27\nIn sum, we hold that in proving expatriation, an expatriating act and an intent to relinquish citizenship must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.  We also hold that when one of the statutory expatriating acts is proved, it is constitutional to presume it to have been a voluntary act until and unless proved otherwise by the actor.  If he succeeds, there can be no expatriation.  If he fails, the question remains whether on all the evidence the Government has satisfied its burden of proof that the expatriating act was performed with the necessary intent to relinquish citizenship.\n\n\n28\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n29\n\nSo ordered.\n\n\n\n30\nMr. Justice STEWART dissents for the reasons stated in Part II of Mr. Justice BRENNAN's dissenting opinion, which he joins.\n\n\n31\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\n32\nI agree with the Court's holding that a citizen of the United States may not lose his citizenship in the absence of a finding that he specifically intended to renounce it.  I also concur in the adoption of a saving construction of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481 (a)(2) to require that the statutorily designated expatriating acts be done with a specific intent to relinquish citizenship.\n\n\n33\nI cannot, however, accept the majority's conclusion that a person may be found to have relinquished his American citizenship upon a preponderance of the evidence that he intended to do so. The Court's discussion of congressional power to \"prescribe rules of evidence and standards of proof in the federal courts,\" ante, at 265, is the beginning, not the end, of the inquiry.  It remains the task of this Court to determine when those rules and standards impinge on constitutional rights.  As my Brother Stevens indicates, the Court's casual dismissal of the importance of American citizenship cannot withstand scrutiny.  And the mere fact that one who has been expatriated is not locked up in a prison does not dispose of the constitutional inquiry.  As Mr. Chief Justice Warren stated over 20 years ago:\n\n\n34\n\"[T]he expatriate has lost the right to have rights.\n\n\n35\n\"This punishment is offensive to cardinal principles for      which the Constitution stands.  It subjects the individual to      a fate of ever-increasing fear and distress.  He knows not      what discriminations may be established against him, what      proscriptions may be directed against him, and when and for      what cause his existence in his native land may be      terminated.  He may be subject to banishment, a fate      universally decried by civilized people.  He is stateless, a      condition deplored in the international community of      democracies.  It is no answer to suggest that all the      disastrous consequences of this fate may not be brought to      bear on a stateless person.  The threat makes the punishment      obnoxious.\"  Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 102, 78 S.Ct. 590,      599, 2 L.Ed.2d 596 (1958) (plurality opinion) (footnotes      omitted).\n\n\n36\nFor these reasons I cannot understand, much less accept, the Court's suggestion that \"expatriation proceedings  . . .  do not threaten a loss of liberty.\"  Ante, at 266.  Recognizing that a standard of proof ultimately \" 'reflects the value society places' \" on the interest at stake, Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 425, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 1809, 60 L.Ed.2d 372 (1979).  I would hold that a citizen may not lose his citizenship in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that he intended to do so.\n\n\n37\nMr. Justice STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\n38\nThe Court today unanimously reiterates the principle set forth in Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253, 87 S.Ct. 1660, 18 L.Ed.2d 757, that Congress may not deprive an American of his citizenship against his will, but may only effectuate the citizen's own intention to renounce his citizenship.  I agree with the Court that Congress may establish certain standards for determining whether such a renunciation has occurred.  It may, for example, provide that expatriation can be proved by evidence that a person has performed an act that is normally inconsistent with continued citizenship and that the person thereby specifically intended to relinquish his American citizenship.\n\n\n39\nI do not agree, however, with the conclusion that Congress has established a permissible standard in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(a)(2). Since we accept dual citizenship, taking an oath of allegiance to a foreign government is not necessarily inconsistent with an intent to remain an American citizen.  Moreover, as now written, the statute cannot fairly be read to require a finding of specific intent to relinquish citizenship.  The statute unambiguously states that\n\n\n40\n\"a national of the United States  . . .  shall lose his      nationality by\u2014\n\n\n41\n*          *          *          *          *\n\n\n42\n\"(2) taking an oath or making an affirmation or other           formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state or a           political subdivision thereof.\"\n\n\n43\nThere is no room in this provision to imply a requirement of a specific intent to relinquish citizenship.  The Court does not attempt to do so, nor does it explain how any other part of the statute supports its conclusion that Congress required proof of specific intent.1\n\n\n44\nI also disagree with the holding that a person may be deprived of his citizenship upon a showing by a mere preponderance of the evidence that he intended to relinquish it.  The Court reasons that because the proceedings in question are civil in nature and do not result in any loss of physical liberty, no greater burden of proof is required than in the ordinary civil case.  Such reasoning construes the constitutional concept of \"liberty\" too narrowly.\n\n\n45\nThe House Report accompanying the 1961 amendment to the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1952 refers to \"the dignity and the priceless value of U. S. citizenship.\"  H.R. Rep. No. 1086, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 41 (1961).  U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, p. 2985.  That characterization is consistent with this Court's repeated appraisal of the quality of the interest at stake in this proceeding.2  In my judgment a person's interest in retaining his American citizenship is surely an aspect of \"liberty\" of which he cannot be deprived without due process of law.  Because the interest at stake is comparable to that involved in Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 60 L.Ed.2d 372, essentially for the reasons stated in THE CHIEF JUSTICE's opinion for a unanimous Court in that case, see id., at 425-427, 431-433, 99 S.Ct., at 1809-1810, 1812-1813, I believe that due process requires that a clear and convincing standard of proof be met in this case as well before the deprivation may occur.\n\n\n46\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART joins as to Part II, dissenting.\n\n\n47\nThe Court holds that one may lose United States citizenship if the Government can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that certain acts, specified by statute, were done with the specific intent of giving up citizenship.  Accordingly, the Court, in reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals, holds that the District Court applied the correct evidentiary standards in determining that appellee was properly stripped of his citizenship.  Because I would hold that one who acquires United States citizenship by virtue of being born in the United States, U.S.Const., Amdt. 14, \u00a7 1, can lose that citizenship only by formally renouncing it, and because I would hold that the act of which appellee is accused in this case cannot be an expatriating act, I dissent.\n\n\n48\n* This case is governed by Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253, 87 S.Ct. 1660, 18 L.Ed.2d 757 (1967).  Afroyim, emphasizing the crucial importance of the right of citizenship, held unequivocally that a citizen has \"a constitutional right to remain a citizen  . . .  unless he voluntarily relinquishes that citizenship.\"  Id., at 268, 87 S.Ct. at 1668.  \"[T]he only way the citizenship  . . .  could be lost was by the voluntary renunciation or abandonment by the citizen himself.\"  Id., at 266, 87 S.Ct., at 1667.  The Court held that because Congress could not \"abridge,\" \"affect,\" \"restrict the effect of,\" or \"take  . . .  away\" citizenship, Congress was \"without power to rob a citizen of his citizenship\" because he voted in a foreign election.  Id., at 267, 87 S.Ct., at 1667.\n\n\n49\nThe same clearly must be true of the Government's attempt to strip appellee of citizenship because he swore an oath of allegiance to Mexico.1  Congress has provided for a procedure by which one may formally renounce citizenship.2  In this case the appellant concedes that appellee has not renounced his citizenship under that procedure.3  Brief for Appellant 56.  Because one can lose citizenship only by voluntarily renouncing it and because appellee has not formally renounced his, I would hold that he remains a citizen.  Accordingly, I would remand the case with orders that appellee be given a declaration of United States nationality.4\n\nII\n\n50\nI reach the same result by another, independent line of reasoning.  Appellee was born a dual national.  He is a citizen of the United States because he was born here and a citizen of Mexico because his father was Mexican.  The only expatriating act of which appellee stands accused is having sworn an oath of allegiance to Mexico.  If dual citizenship, per se, can be consistent with United States citizenship, Perkins v. Elg, 307 U.S. 325, 329, 59 S.Ct. 884, 887, 83 L.Ed. 1320 (1939),5 then I cannot see why an oath of allegiance to the other country of which one is already a citizen should create inconsistency.  One owes allegiance to any country of which one is a citizen, especially when one is living in that country.  Kawakita v. United States, 343 U.S. 717, 733-735, 72 S.Ct. 950, 960-961, 96 L.Ed. 1249 (1952).6  The formal oath adds nothing to the existing foreign citizenship and, therefore, cannot affect his United States citizenship.\n\n\n\n1\n The relevant statutory provisions are \u00a7\u00a7 349(a)(2), (c) of the Act, 66 Stat. 267, as amended, 75 Stat. 656, as set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481:\n\"(a) From and after the effective date of this chapter a person who is a national of the United States whether by birth or naturalization, shall lose his nationality by\u2014\n*          *          *          *          *\n\"(2) taking an oath or making an affirmation or other formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state or a political subdivision thereof;\n*          *          *          *          *\n\"(c) Whenever the loss of United States nationality is put in issue in any action or proceeding commenced on or after September 26, 1961 under, or by virtue of, the provisions of this chapter or any other Act, the burden shall be upon the person or party claiming that such loss occurred, to establish such claim by a preponderance of the evidence.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, any person who commits or performs, or who has committed or performed, any act of expatriation under the provisions of this chapter or any other Act shall be presumed to have done so voluntarily, but such presumption may be rebutted upon a showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the act or acts committed or performed were not done voluntarily.\"\n\n\n2\n The application contained the following statement:\n\"I therefore hereby expressly renounce ____ citizenship, as well as any submission, obedience, and loyalty to any foreign government, especially to that of ____, of which I might have been subject, all protection foreign to the laws and authorities of Mexico, all rights which treaties or international law grant to foreigners;  and furthermore I swear adherence, obedience, and submission to the laws and authorities of the Mexican Republic.\"\nThe blank spaces in the statement were filled in with the words \"Estados Unidos\" (United States) and \"Norteamerica\" (North America), respectively.  Brief for Appellant 4.\n\n\n3\n The Fourteenth Amendment, \u00a7 1, reads:  \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"\n\n\n4\n In remanding the case to the District Court, the Court of Appeals did not \"necessarily requir[e] that court to conduct a new trial.\"  577 F.2d, at 12.  The Court of Appeals recognized that, even granting the higher standard of proof it had imposed on the District Court, the factual determinations already on the record might be adequate to permit consideration of the case on remand without the holding of another trial or evidentiary hearing. Ibid.\n\n\n5\n The Court of Appeals' discussion of specific intent is submerged in its analysis of proper evidentiary standards.  Id., at 11.  The absence of independent analysis undoubtedly resulted from the Secretary's failure to contend in either the District Court or the Court of Appeals that it was unnecessary to prove an intent to relinquish citizenship.  Indeed, the jurisdictional statement filed by the Secretary in this Court presented the single question whether 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(c) is unconstitutional under the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment;  it did not present separately the question whether proof of a specific intent to relinquish is essential to expatriation.\nOur Rule 15(1)(c) states that \"[o]nly the questions set forth in the jurisdictional statement or fairly comprised therein will be considered by the court.\"  The Secretary now argues that resolution of the intent issue is an essential, or at least an advisable, predicate to an intelligent resolution of the constitutionality of \u00a7 1481(c).  There is some merit in this position:  arguably the intent issue is fairly comprised in the question set forth in the jurisdictional statement.  In any event, consideration of issues not present in the jurisdictional statement or petition for certiorari and not presented in the Court of Appeals is not beyond our power, and in appropriate circumstances we have addressed them.  Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois Foundation, 402 U.S. 313, 320, n. 6, 91 S.Ct. 1434, 1438, n. 6, 28 L.Ed.2d 788 (1971); Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 66, 68-69, 58 S.Ct. 817, 818, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938) (parties agreed that Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, 10 L.Ed. 865 (1842), was still good law).  Cf. Vachon v. New Hampshire, 414 U.S. 478, 94 S.Ct. 664, 38 L.Ed.2d 666 (1974); Moragne v. States Marine Lines, 398 U.S. 375, 90 S.Ct. 1772, 26 L.Ed.2d 330 (1970);  Silber v. United States, 370 U.S. 717, 82 S.Ct. 1287, 8 L.Ed.2d 798 (1962).  See generally R. Stern & E. Gressman, Supreme Court Practice, \u00a7\u00a7 6.27 and 7.14 (5th ed. 1978).\nAs will be more apparent below, the Secretary, represented in this Court by the Solicitor General, has changed his position on the intent issue since the decision of the Court of Appeals;  and his present position is at odds with a 1969 opinion of the Attorney General, 42 Op.Atty.Gen. 397, which interpreted Afroyim v. Rusk and guided the administrative actions of the State Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  The issue of intent is important, the parties have briefed it, and we shall address it.\n\n\n6\n As the Secretary states in his brief, Brief for Appellant 57, n. 28,\n\"both the State Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service have adopted administrative guidelines that attempt to ascertain the individual's intent by taking into consideration the nature of the expatriating act and the individual's statements and actions made in connection with that act.\"\nThe State Department's guideline evidences a position on intent quite similar to that adopted here:\n\"In the light of the Afroyim decision and the Attorney General's Statement of Interpretation of that decision, the Department now holds that the taking of a meaningful oath of allegiance to a foreign state is highly persuasive evidence of an intent to transfer or abandon allegiance.  The taking of an oath that is not meaningful does not result in expatriation.  The meaningfulness of the oath must be decided by the Department on the individual merits of each case.\"  Department of State, 8 Foreign Affairs Manual \u00a7 224.2, p. 2 (1970) (emphasis in original).\nCf. Immigration and Naturalization Service, Interpretations \u00a7 349.1(d)(2), p. 6976.4 (1970) (characterizing Afroyim as overruling Perez \u00a7 holding \"that expatriation could flow from a voluntary act even though the citizen did not intend thereby to relinquish his United States citizenship\").\nContemporaneous academic commentary agreed that Afroyim imposed the requirement of intent to relinquish citizenship on a party seeking to establish expatriation.  See Comment, An Expatriation Enigma:  Afroyim v. Rusk, 48 B.U.L.Rev. 295, 298 (1968);  Note, Acquisition of Foreign Citizenship:  The Limits of Afroyim v. Rusk, 54 Cornell L.Rev. 624, 624-625 (1969);  The Supreme Court:  1966 Term, 81 Harv.L.Rev. 69, 126 (1967);  Note, 29 Ohio St.L.J. 797, 801 (1968).\n\n\n7\n In his response to the petition for certiorari in Matheson, the Solicitor General argued that \"Afroyim broadly held that Congress has no power to prescribe any objective conduct that will automatically result in expatriation, absent the individual's voluntary relinquishment of citizenship.  . . . \" Brief in Opposition in Matheson v. United States, O.T.1976, No. 75-1651, p. 8.  In Matheson, it was maintained, \"there is nothing in the record that would support a finding that decedent's application for a certificate of Mexican nationality was prompted by a specific intent to relinquish her American citizenship.\" Id., at 7.  Thus, the Solicitor General concluded, no expatriation could be said to have taken place.\n\n\n8\n The House Report accompanying \u00a7 1481(c), H.R.Rep. No. 1086, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 40 (1961), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, p. 2950, took direct aim at Nishikawa \u00a7 holding that \"the Government must in each case prove voluntary conduct by clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence.\"  Nishikawa v. Dulles, 356 U.S., at 138, 78 S.Ct., at 617.  The Report quoted with approval from Mr. Justice Harlan's dissenting opinion in Nishikawa :\n\" 'Although the Court recognizes the general rule that consciously performed acts are presumed voluntary, [citations omitted], it in fact alters this rule in all denationalization cases by placing the burden of proving voluntariness on the Government, thus relieving citizen-claimants in such cases from the duty of proving that their presumably voluntary acts were actually involuntary.\n\" 'One of the prime reasons for imposing the burden of proof on the party claiming involuntariness is that the evidence normally lies in his possession.\n\" 'I  * * *  find myself compelled to dissent because in my opinion the majority's position can be squared neither with congressional intent nor with proper and well-established rules governing the burden of proof on the issue of duress.' \"  H.R.Rep. No. 1086, supra, at 41 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, p. 2984 (quoting Nishikawa v. Dulles, supra, 356 U.S., at 144-145, 78 S.Ct., at 621.\nThe Report continued:\n\"In order to forestall further erosion of the statute designed to preserve and uphold the dignity and the priceless value of U. S. citizenship, with attendant obligations,  . . .  [\u00a7 1481(c)] sets up rules of evidence under which the burden of proof to establish loss of citizenship by preponderance of the evidence would rest upon the Government.\"  H.R.Rep. No. 1086, supra, at 41. The Report concluded by describing the rebuttable presumption of voluntariness in \u00a7 1481(c).\n\n\n9\n The Secretary asserts that the \u00a7 1481(c) presumption cannot survive constitutional scrutiny if we hold that intent to relinquish citizenship is a necessary element in proving expatriation.  Brief for Appellant 26.  The predicate for this assertion seems to be that \u00a7 1481(c) presumes intent to relinquish as well as voluntariness.  We do not so read it.  Even if we did, and even if we agreed that presuming the necessary intent is inconsistent with Afroyim, it would be unnecessary to invalidate the section insofar as it presumes that the expatriating act itself was performed voluntarily.\n\n\n10\n The Court's departure from the normal rule that duress is an affirmative defense to be proved by the party seeking to rely on it was noted when Nishikawa was handed down.  See The Supreme Court:  1957 Term, 72 Harv.L.Rev. 77, 166, 171 (1958) (Nishikawa \"not only extended the Government's burden in expatriation proceedings to include the absence of duress if this issue is raised, but also determined the standard by which it must be shown.  The position of the majority runs counter to the usual rule that duress is an affirmative defense\").\n\n\n11\n The rule that duress is an affirmative defense to be pleaded and proved by the party attempting to rely on it is well established.  Even where a plaintiff's complaint improperly contains allegations that seek to avoid or defeat a potential affirmative defense, \"it is inappropriate for the court to shift the burden of proof on the anticipated defense to plaintiff as a 'sanction' for failing to follow the burden of pleading structure established by Rule 8 or by adopting the fiction that plaintiff's anticipation of the issue evidences his intention to 'assume' the burden of proving it.\"  5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1276, p. 327 (1969).  On affirmative defenses generally, see id., \u00a7 1270, at 289 et seq.\n\n\n1\n It could perhaps be argued that a specific intent requirement can be derived from 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(c).  That subsection creates a rebuttable presumption that any expatriating act set forth in subsection (a) was performed \"voluntarily.\"  The term \"voluntary\" could conceivably be stretched to include the concept of a specific intent to renounce one's citizenship.  While the person seeking to retain his citizenship would thus have the burden of showing a lack of specific intent, such a construction would at least provide a statutory basis for bringing the issue of intent into the proceeding.  The majority apparently would not be willing to accept such a construction in order to salvage the statute, however, inasmuch as it rejects the Secretary's argument that, if there is a requirement of specific intent, it is also subject to the presumption applicable to voluntariness.  Ante, at 268.\nThe majority's assumption that the statute can be read to require specific intent to relinquish citizenship as an element of proof is also contradicted by the Court's treatment in Afroyim of a different subsection of the same statute.  Like the subsection at issue here, subsection (a)(5) provided that an American automatically lost his nationality by performing a specific act: in that case, voting in a foreign election.  If the majority's analysis in this case was correct, the Court in Afroyim should not have invalidated that provision of the statute;  rather, it should merely have remanded for a finding as to whether Afroyim had voted in a foreign election with specific intent to relinquish his American citizenship.  That the Court did not do so is strong evidence of its belief that the statute could not be reformed as it is today.\n\n\n2\n See Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 160, 83 S.Ct. 554, 563, 9 L.Ed.2d 664, where the Court quoted another report describing American citizenship as \" 'one of the most valuable rights in the world today.' \"  See also Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253, 267-268, 87 S.Ct. 1660, 1667-1668, 18 L.Ed.2d 757; Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 92, 78 S.Ct. 590, 593, 2 L.Ed.2d 596.\n\n\n1\n He was a Mexican citizen by virtue of his father's citizenship.\n\n\n2\n Title 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(a)(6) provides that \"a national of the United States whether by birth or naturalization, shall lose his nationality by . . .\n*          *          *          *          *\nmaking a formal renunciation of nationality before a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States in a foreign state, in such form as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State.\"  The Secretary of State has prescribed such procedures in 22 CFR \u00a7 50.50 (1979).  See Department of State, 8 Foreign Affairs Manual \u00a7 225.6 (1972).  Congress also provided for renunciation by citizens while in the United States in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(a)(7). This last provision is not relevant to our case.\n\n\n3\n Therefore, the appellant does not argue that appellee can be expatriated under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(a)(6).  See n.2, supra.\n\n\n4\n I would not reach the issues concerning 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(c).\n\n\n5\n Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U.S. 815, 91 S.Ct. 1060, 28 L.Ed.2d 499 (1971), is not to the contrary.  Bellei's citizenship was not based on the Fourteenth Amendment, id., at 833, 835, 91 S.Ct., at 1070, 1071, and the issue before the Court was whether Bellei could lose his statutory citizenship for failure to satisfy a condition subsequent contained in the same statute that accorded him citizenship.\n\n\n6\n Indeed, the opinion of the State Department once was \"that a person with a dual citizenship who lives abroad in the other country claiming him as a national owes an allegiance to it which is paramount to the allegiance he owes the United States.\" Kawakita v. United States, 343 U.S., at 734-735, 72 S.Ct., at 961.\n\n\n","label":1}

The petitioners and six others were convicted.1 Their convictions were affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 259 F.2d 886. Certiorari was granted to examine the scope of the conspiracy statute in the context of these provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. 358 U.S. 905, 79 S.Ct. 234, 3 L.Ed.2d 227.\n\n\n2\nAt the trial it was established by overwhelming evidence that the petitioners had engaged with numerous others in a closely organized and large-scale operation of the numbers game in Atlanta, Georgia, during the years 1954 to 1957, the period covered by the indictment.2 That activity is a criminal offense under Georgia law.3 The evidence also established in intricate detail that the participants in this large-scale enterprise had, through a variety of carefully planned stratagems, made every effort to conceal its operation.4 Finally, the evidence showed that none of the petitioners had paid any of the federal taxes in question. There was no direct evidence to show that any of the petitioners knew of these taxes.\n\n\n3\nIn addition to the conspiracy count, the indictment under which the petitioners were tried also contained two additional counts charging them with the substantive offenses of willful failure to pay the special tax imposed by \u00a7 4411 of the Internal Revenue Code,5 in violation of \u00a7 7203 of the Code,6 and of failure to register as required by \u00a7 4412 of the Code,7 in violation of \u00a7 7272 of the Code.8 The trial took place subsequent to the announcement of this Court's decision in United States v. Calamaro, 354 U.S. 351, 77 S.Ct. 1138, 1 L.Ed.2d 1394, and the district judge correctly instructed the jury that conviction of the substantive offenses would be justified only as to any defendants found to be 'writers,' 'bankers,' or to have 'a proprietary interest in such lottery operation.' Two of the petitioners, Ingram an d Jenkins, were found guilty on both substantive counts and do not question these convictions, conceding the sufficiency of the evidence to show that Ingram was the banker and that Jenkins had a proprietary interest in the enterprise. The evidence showed that the other two petitioners, Smith and Law, were relatively minor clerical functionaries at the headquarters of the operation, and they were acquitted on the substantive counts.\n\n\n4\nIn sum, what this record presents then is a picture of a large-scale and profitable gambling business conducted in Atlanta over a period of several years by petitioners Ingram and Jenkins. He business involved many participants, including the petitioners Smith and Law. It was a business made criminal by the laws of Georgia, and everyone in the organization participated in trying to keep its operation secret. Ingram and Jenkins were liable for the federal taxes imposed by \u00a7\u00a7 4401 and 4411 of the Internal Revenue Code and willfully failed to pay them. They were required by \u00a7 4412 of the Code to register with the official in charge of the Internal Revenue District, and they failed to do so. Smith and Law were not themselves subject to any of the taxes here involved. The question presented is whether this factual foundation is sufficient to support a conviction of the petitioners, or any of them, for conspiracy to attempt to evade or defeat federal taxes, 'the gravest of offenses against the revenues.' Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492, 499, 63 S.Ct. 364, 368, 87 L.Ed. 418. We hold that it was sufficient as to Ingram and Jenkins, and insufficient as to Smith and Law.\n\n\n5\nAs to Ingram and Jenkins, the record is clear. They were entrepreneurs in a vast and profitable gambling business. They were clearly liable for the special taxes and registration requirements that the Federal Government has imposed upon the operators of that kind of business. United States v. Kahriger, 345 U.S. 22, 73 S.Ct. 510, 97 L.Ed. 754. Not only did they willfully fail and neglect to pay these taxes, but they conspired to conceal the operation of the business and the source of the income upon which the tax is imposed.\n\n\n6\nIn Spies v. United States this Court had occasion to consider the quantum and type of evidence required to support a conviction for the substantive offense of attempting to defeat or evade federal taxes as contrasted with the lesser proof required to convict of the isd emeanor of willfully failing to file a return or to pay a tax. It was there said:\n\n\n7\n'Willful but passive neglect of the statutory duty may      constitute the lesser offense, but to combine with it a      willful and positive attempt to evade tax in any manner or to      defeat it by any means lifts the offense to the degree of      felony.\n\n\n8\n'Congress did not define or limit the methods by which a      willful attempt to defeat and evade might be accomplished and      perhaps did not define lest its effort to do so result in      some unexpected limitation. Nor would we by definition      constrict the scope of the Congressional provision that it      may be accomplished 'in any manner.' By way of illustration,      and not by way of limitation, we would think affirmative      willful attempt may be inferred from conduct such as keeping      a double set of books, making false entries or alterations, or false invoices or documents, destruction of      books or records, concealment of assets or covering up      sources of income, handling of one's affairs to avoid making      the records usual in transactions of the kind, and any      conduct, the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to      conceal. If the tax-evasion motive plays any part in such      conduct the offense may be made out even though the conduct      may also serve other purposes such as concealment of other      crime.' 317 U.S. at page 499, 63 S.Ct. at page 368.\n\n\n9\nIn Spies, the Court was dealing with the substantive offense, not with a conspiracy to commit it. But the evidence of agreement between Ingram and Jenkins to operate this gambling enterprise, which operation made them liable for federal taxes, and to conceal its operation and its income is clear on this record, and is virtually conceded by the petitioners. The evidence was sufficient to support a conclusion that they were engaged not only in a conspiracy to operate and conceal their gambling enterprise, but that they were also parties to an agreement to attempt to defeat or evade the federal taxes imposed upon tne operators of such a business.\n\n\n10\nAs to Smith and Law, the case is quite a different one. While the record clearly supports a finding that Smith and Law were participants in a conspiracy to operate a lottery and to conceal that operation from local law enforcement agencies, we find no warrant for a finding that they were, like Ingram and Jenkins, parties to a conspiracy with a purpose illegal under federal law. Certainly there is nothing in the record to show that Smith and Law knew that Ingram and Jenkins had not paid the taxes, a fact obviously within the knowledge of the latter.\n\n\n11\nIt is fundamental that a conviction for conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371, cannot be sustained unless there is 'proof of an agreement to commit an offense against the United States.' Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 12, 74 S.Ct. 358, 364, 98 L.Ed. 435. There need not, of course, be proof that the conspirators were aware of the criminality of their objective, but an essential ingredient of the proof was knowledge on the part of Smith and Law that Ingram and Jenkins were liable for federal taxes by reason of the gambling operation. 'Without the knowledge, the intent cannot exist.' Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703, 711, 63 S.Ct. 1265, 1269, 87 L.Ed. 1674.\n\n\n12\n'(C)onspiracy to commit a particular substantive offense cannot exist without at least the degree of criminal intent necessary for the substantive offense itself.'9 The substantive offense which Smith and Law were accused of conspiring to commit was the willful evasion of federal taxes, an offense which, even presuming knowledge of the tax law, obviously cannot be committed in the absence of knowledge of willfulness. Spies v. United States, supra, Cf. United States v. Falcone, 311 U.S. 205, 61 S.Ct. 204, 85 L.Ed. 128.\n\n\n13\nIndulging, as of course we must, in that view of the evidence most favorable to the Goern ment, we simply cannot discern adequate foundation in the present record for a finding that Smith and Law had such knowledge of Ingram's and Jenkins' wagering tax liability. The record is completely barren of any direct evidence of such knowledge. It was not shown, for example, that any reference had ever been made by any of the petitioners to possible tax liability, or that they had filed a return or paid a tax in previous years. The Government relied instead upon evidence which, it asserts, circumstantially proved the requisite knowledge on the part of Smith and Law. These circumstances were simply the intimate connection of Smith and Law with the operation of the lottery itself, their cooperation in conducting it secretly,10 and their apparent knowledge that it was conducted at a profit. The Government points out that not only would payment of the taxes have decreased the profits to be derived from operation of the lottery, but in addition would have required registration, including the names and addresses of the bankers and writers, with the local internal revenue office and the posting of a wagering tax stamp at the place of business. 26 U.S.C. (Supp. V) \u00a7\u00a7 4412, 6806(c), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 4412, 6806(c). The information contained in the registration would have been available to local law enforcement officials. 26 U.S.C. (Supp. V) \u00a7 6107, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6107.\n\n\n14\nYet these circumstances actually are colorless as to the vital issue of knowledge on the part of Smith and Law that their superiors owed federal wagering taxes. Certainly the secrecy of the operation did not go to show that knowledge. This is not a case where efforts at concealment would be reasonably explainable only in terms of motivation to evade taxation. Here, the criminality of the enterprise under local law provided more than sufficient reason for the secrecy in which it was conducted. A conspiracy, to be sure, may have multiple objectives, United States v. Rabinowich, 238 U.S. 78, 86, 35 S.Ct. 682, 684, 59 L.Ed. 1211, and if one of its objectives, even a minor one, be the evasion of feferal taxes, the offense is made out, though the primary objective may be concealment of another crime. See Spies v. United States, supra, 317 U.S. at page 499, 63 S.Ct. at page 368. But the fact that payment of the federal taxes by Ingram and Jenkins might have resulted in disclosure of the lottery and subsequent prosecution of Smith and Law by local authorities would permit an inference that concealment of the lottery was motivated by a purpose to evade payment of federal taxes only if, independently, there were proof that Smith and Law knew of the tax liability. Evidence that Smith and Law might have wanted the taxes to be evaded if they had known of them, and that they engaged in conduct which could have been in furtherance of a plan to evade the taxes if they had known of them, is not evidence that they did know of them.\n\n\n15\nWhat was said in Direct Sales Co. v. United States on behalf of a unanimous Court is of particular relevance here:\n\n\n16\n'Without the knowledge, the intent cannot exist. * * *      Furthermore to  establish the intent, the evidence of      knowledge must be clear, not equivocal. * * * This, because      charges of conspiracy are not to be made out by piling      inference upon inference, thus fashioning * * * a dragnet to      draw in all substantive crimes.' 319 U.S. at page 711, 63      S.Ct. at page 1269.\n\n\n17\nSmith and Law were not liable for the wagering tax. United States v. Calamaro, supra. They could not, therefore, have been convicted of the crime which they were charged with having conspired to commit. To sustain their conviction on this record would make of the crime of conspiracy just that 'dragnet to draw in all substantive crimes' against which the Court warned in Direct Sales. Cf. Gebardi v. United States, 287 U.S. 112, 53 S.Ct. 35, 77 L.Ed. 206.\n\n\n18\nAccordingly, while affirming the convictions of Ingram and Jenkins, we hold that the motions for acquittal of Smith and Law should have been sustained by the District Court, and that the Court of Appeals was in error in affirming their convictions.\n\n\n19\nJudgment accordingly.\n\n\n20\nMr. Justice BLACK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n21\nMr. Justice HARLAN, whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice BRENNAN join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\n22\nThe constitutional validity of the occupational tax provisions on persons engaged in the business of accepting wagers has been established by United States v. Kahriger, 345 U.S. 22, 73 S.Ct. 510, 97 L.Ed. 754. In construing those provisions, however, we have held that no weight can be given to the suggestion that they must be interpreted on the premise that their enactment was \"in part motivated by a congressional desire to suppress wagering.\" United States v. Calamaro, 354 U.S. 351, 77 S.Ct. 1138, 1143, 1 L.Ed.2d 1394. In that case we held that only 'writers,' 'bankers,' or those who have a 'proprietary interest' in a lottery operation are subject to the taxing statutes, and that therefore only those persons can be held for violation of their substantive provisions.\n\n\n23\nIn this case the Government has in effect sought to by-pass Calamaro by the simple expedient of indicting persons connected with a lottery operation not for the substantive offenses proscribed by the Internal Revenue Code, but instead for conspiring with those members of the lottery operation who are personally subject to the relevant excise taxes to evade payment of those taxes. Two essential elements of the crime, first, knowledge that the taxes are due, and, second, a 'willful and positive attempt to evade tax in any manner or to defeat it by any means,' Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492, 499, 63 S.Ct. 364, 368, are sought to be established here by the naked fact that the lottery operation was carefully concealed by all who participated in it. Since lotteries are unlawful in virtually every State, more particularly in Georgia where this enterprise was carried on, and therefore require concealment if they are to continue to operate, to permit a conviction on such evidence alone would relegate Calamaro to the status of an unmeaningful relic. The opinion of the Court convincingly demonstrates why the evidence in the case does not support a finding by the jury that petitioners Smith and Law knew that a tax was owing by petitioners Ingram and Jenkins, and that they undertook acts of concealment for the purpose, in whole or in part, of aiding an evasion of that tax.\n\n\n24\nBut I think that the very considerations which lead the Court to reverse the conviction of Smith and Law equally require a reversal as to Ingram and Jenkins. An indispensable element of the crime of tax evasion is knowledge that a tax is imposed. This knowledge may be proved directly or circumstantially. Here there is no direct proof, and the sole circumstantial evidence relied on by the Government is the fact of concealment of the lottery operation. But if, as the Court holds, 'certainly the secrecy of the operation did not go to show * * * knowledge' by Smith and Law that their superiors were liable for a federal tax, I am at a loss to understand how this factor can at the same time suffice to show knowledge on the part of petitioners Ingram and Jenkins that they themselves were liable for a federal tax. The latter no less than the former must be shown to have actual knowledge that a tax is owing before they can be convicted of a conspiracy to evade that tax, and the Court's reasoning plainly demonstrates to me that the Government has made no such showing in this case.\n\n\n25\nI think that sight has been lost of the fact that this is a prosecution for conspiracy to violate a federal taxing statute, not for violation of local gambling laws. An overwhelming showing has been made that petitioners were participants in a large lottery enterprise, but that does not suffice to support conviction of the crime with which they are here charged.\n\n\n\n1\n Section 4401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 provides:\n'(a) Wagers.\u2014There shall be imposed on wagers, as defined in section 4421, an excise tax equal to 10 percent of the amount thereof.\n'(c) Persons liable for tax.\u2014Each person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers shall be liable for and shall pay the tax under this subchapter on all wagers placed with him. Each person who conducts any wagering pool or lottery shall be liable for and shall pay the tax under this subchapter on all wagers placed in such pool or lottery.' 68A Stat. 525, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4401.\nSection 4411 of the Code provides: 'There shall be imposed a special tax of $50 per year to be paid by each person who is liable for tax under section 4401 or who is engaged in receiving wagers for or on behalf of any person so liable.' 68A Stat. 527, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4411.\nSection 4421 of the Code includes in the definition of 'wager' 'any wager placed in a lottery conducted for profit' and includes in the definition of 'lottery' 'the numbers game, policy, and similar types of wagering.' 68A Stat. 528, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4421.\nSection 7201 of the Code provides: 'Any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this title or the payment thereof shall * * * be guilty of a felony * * *' 68A Stat. 851, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7201.\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371, provides: 'If two or more persons conspire * * * to commit any offense against the United States, * * * and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined * * * or imprisoned * * *.' 62 Stat. 701.\nThese were the links in the statutory chain under which the petitioners were indicted and convicted.\n\n\n2\n Some of the items found when the headquarters of the operation was raided in 1957 were clearly indicative of the magnitude of the enterprise. Among the items found on that occasion were some 2,400 scratch pads of the type used in numbers operations, thousands of coin wrappers, a police alarm radio, with a secret code of police calls, two high-frequency radios, and six fictitious automobile registrations with license tags. Petitioner Ingram was alleged to have stated in 1955 that the 'business is down to about' $3,500 per day.\n\n\n3\n Georgia Code (1953 Revision), \u00a7 26\u20146502.\n\n\n4\n There was extensive evidence, for example, that participants in the enterprise used false license plates on their automobiles, took evasive routes to the 'checkup headquarters' of the operation, used false names on occasion, and atemp ted to bribe local law enforcement officers.\n\n\n5\n See Note 1, supra.\n\n\n6\n This section of the Code provides: 'Any person required under this title to pay any * * * tax, * * * who willfully fails to pay such * * * tax, * * * shall * * * be guilty of a misdemeanor * * *.' 68A Stat. 851, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7203.\n\n\n7\n This section of the Code provides: 'Each person required to pay a special tax under this subchapter shall register with the official in charge of the internal revenue district\u2014* * *.' 68A Stat. 527, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4412.\n\n\n8\n This section of the Code provides: 'Any person who fails to register with the Secretary or his delegate as required by this title * * * shall be liable to a penalty of $50.' 68A Stat. 866, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7272.\n\n\n9\n See 'Developments in the Law\u2014Criminal Conspiracy,' 72 Harv.L.Rev. 920, at 939, and authorities there cited.\n\n\n10\n The Court's decisions in Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 391, 77 S.Ct. 963, 1 L.Ed.2d 931; Lutwak v. United States, 344 U.S. 604, 73 S.Ct. 481, 97 L.Ed. 593; and Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440, 69 S.Ct. 716, 93 L.Ed. 790, do not, as petitioners appear to contend, prevent the jury from treating this subsidiary objective as an element of the conspiracy. Those cases hold only that the life of the conspiracy cannot be extended by evidence of concealment after the conspiracy's criminal objectives have been fully accomplished. '* * * (A) vital distinction must be made between acts of concealment done in furtherance of the main criminal objectives of the conspiracy, and acts of concealment done after these central objectives have been attained, for the purpose only of covering up after the crime.'

{"text":"385 U.S. 214\n87 S.Ct. 473\n17 L.Ed.2d 318\nIMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE, Petitioner,v.Giuseppe ERRICO.  Muriel May SCOTT, nee Plummer, Petitioner,  v.  IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE.\nNos. 54 and 91.\nArgued Oct. 20, 1966.\nDecided Dec. 12, 1966.\n\nSol. Gen., Thurgood Marshall, for Immigration and Naturalization service.\nFrank M. Ierulli, Portland, Or., for Giuseppe Errico.\nJulius C. Biervliet, Mount Vernon, N.Y., for Muriel May Scott.\nMr. Cheif Justice WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nWe granted certiorari in these cases to resolve a conflict between the Second and Ninth Circuits on their interpretations of \u00a7 241(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.1 The issue is identical in both cases and, therefore, lends itself to a single opinion.\n\nSection 241(f) reads as follows:\n\n2\n'The provisions of this section relating to the deportation      of aliens within the United States on the ground that they      were excludable at the time of entry as aliens who have      sought to procure, or have procured visas or other      documentation, or entry into the United States by fraud or      misrepresentation shall not apply to an alien otherwise      admissible at the time of entry who is the spouse, parent, or      a child of a United States citizens or of an alien lawfully      admitted for permanent residence.'\n\n\n3\nThe issue is whether the statute saves from deportation an alien who misrepresents his status for the purpose of evading quota restrictions, if he has the necessary familial relationship to a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident.\n\n\n4\nRespondent Errico in No. 54, a native of Italy, falsely represented to the immigration authorities that he was a skilled mechanic with specialized experience in repairing foreign automobiles. On the basis of that misrepresentation he was granted first preference quota status under the statutory preference scheme then in effect, and entered the United States in 1959 with his wife. A child was born to the couple in 1960 and acquired United States citizenship at birth. In 1963 deportation proceedings were commenced against Errico on the ground that he was excludable at the time of entry as not 'of the proper status under the quota specified in the immigrant visa.'2 Throughout the proceedings Errico insisted that he was saved from deportation by \u00a7 241(f). The special inquiry officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled that relief under \u00a7 241(f) was not available because Errico had not complied with quota requirements and, hence, was not 'otherwise admissible at the time of entry.' The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the deportation order but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the construction of the statute adopted by the Board would strip it of practically all meaning, since a material misrepresentation would presumably be given to conceal some factor that would bear on admissibility. 349 F.2d 541. We granted certiorari. 383 U.S. 941, 86 S.Ct. 1196, 16 L.Ed.2d 205.\n\n\n5\nPetitioner Scott in No. 91, a native of Jamaica, contracted a marriage with a United States citizen by proxy solely for the purpose of obtaining nonquota status for entry into the country. She has never lived with her husband and never intended to do so. After entering the United States in 1958, she gave birth to an illegitimate child, who became an American citizen at birth. When the fraud was discovered, deportation proceedings were begun, and a special inquiry officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service found her deportable on the ground that she was not a nonquota immigrant as specified in her visa.3 The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the Board. 350 F.2d 279. The court agreed with the Board of Immigration Appeals that a sham marriage contracted solely to circumvent the immigration laws would not confer nonquota status on an alien as the spouse of an American citizen. It also affirmed the ruling that Mrs. Scott was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 241(f) because she was not otherwise admissible at the time of entry, since her country's quota was oversubscribed. We granted certiorari. 383 U.S. 941, 86 S.Ct. 1211, 16 L.Ed.2d 206.\n\n\n6\nAt the outset it should be noted that even the Government agrees that \u00a7 241(f) cannot be applied with strict literalness. Literally, \u00a7 241(f) applies only when the alien is charged with entering in violation of \u00a7 212(a)(19) of the statute, which excludes from entry '(a)ny alien who * * * has procured a visa or other documentation * * * by fraud, or by willfully misrepresenting a material fact.'4 Under this interpretation, an alien who entered by fraud could be deported for having entered with a defective visa or for other documentary irregularities even if he would have been admissible if he had not committed the fraud. The Government concedes that such an interpretation would be inconsistent with the manifest purpose of the section, and the administrative authorities have consistently held that \u00a7 241(f) waives any deportation charge that results directly from the misrepresentation regardless of the section of the statute under which the charge was brought, provided that the alien was 'otherwise admissible at the time of entry.'5 The Government's argument in both cases is that to be otherwise admissible at the time of entry the alien must show that he would have been admitted even if he had not lied, and that the aliens in these cases would not have been admitted because of the quota restrictions. It is the argument of the aliens that our adoption of the government thesis would negate the intention of Congress to apply fair humanitarian standards in granting relief from the consequences of their fraud to aliens who are close relatives of United States citizens, and that the statute would have practically no effect if construed as the Government argues, since it requires a considerable stretch of the imagination to conceive of an alien making a material misrepresentation that did not conceal some factor that would make him inadmissible.\n\n\n7\nThe sharp divergence of opinion among the circuit judges in these cases indicates that the meaning of the words 'otherwise admissible' is not obvious. An interpretation of these words requires close attention to the language of \u00a7 241(f), to the language of its predecessor, \u00a7 7 of the 1957 Act,6 and to the legislative history of these provisions.\n\n\n8\nThe legislative history begins with the enactment of the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, 62 Stat. 1009. This Act provided for the admission to the United States of thousands of war refugess, many from countries that had fallen behind the Iron Curtain. Some of these refugees misrepresented their nationality or homeland while in Europe to avoid being repatriated to a Communist country. In so doing, however, they fell afoul of \u00a7 10 of the Act, which provided that persons making willful misrepresentations for the purpose of gaining admission 'shall thereafter not be admissible into the United States.' The plight of these refugees, who were excluded from the United States for misrepresentations that were generally felt to be justifiable, inspired recurring proposals for statutory reform. When the Act was revised and codified in 1952, the House Committee recommended adding a provision to save such refugees from deportation when they had misrepresented their nationality or homeland only to avoid repatriation and persecution.7 The Conference Committee deleted the provision, but announced its sympathy with the refugees in the following terms:\n\n\n9\n'It is also the opinion of the conferees that the sections of      the bill which provide for the exclusion of aliens who obtained travel documents by fraud or by      willfully misrepresenting a material fact, should not serve      to exclude or to deport certain bona fide refugees who in      fear of being forcibly repatriated to their former homelands      misrepresented their place of birth when applying for a visa      and such misrepresentation did not have as its basis the      desire to evade the quota provisions of the law or an      investigation in the place of their former residence. The      conferees wish to emphasize that in applying fair      humanitarian standards in the administrative adjudication of      such cases, every effort is to be made to prevent the evasion      of law by fraud and to protect the interest of the United      States.' H.R.Rep.No.2096, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 128 (1952),      U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1952, p. 1754.\n\n\n10\nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Attorney General did not construe the statute as the Conference Committee had recommended, believing that the explicit statutory language did not allow for an exemption for justifiable misrepresentations. Refugees who misrepresented their place of origin were always found to have concealed a material fact, since the misrepresentation hindered an investigation of their background.8\n\n\n11\nThe misrepresentation section was not the only provision of the 1952 legislation that was widely thought to be unnecessarily harsh and restrictive, and in 1957 Congress passed legislation alleviating in many respects the stricter provisions of the earlier legislation. The purpose of the 1957 Act is perfectly clear from its terms, as well as from the relevant House and Senate Committee Reports.9 The most important provisions of the Act provide for special nonquota status for the adopted children or illegitimate children of immigrant parents, and for orphans who have been or are to be adopted by United States citizens. Other important provisions allow the Attorney General to waive certain grounds for exclusion or deportation, including affliction with tuberculosis or conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, on behalf of aliens who are near relatives of United States citizens or of aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The intent of the Act is plainly to grant exceptions to the rigorous provisions of the 1952 Act for the purpose of keeping family units together. Congress felt that, in many circumstances, it was more important to unite families and preserve family ties than it was to enforce strictly the quota limitations or even the many restrictive sections that are designed to keep undesirable or harmful aliens out of the country.10\n\n\n12\nIn this context it is not surprising that Congress also granted relief to aliens facing exclusion or deportation because they has gained entry through misrepresentation. Section 7 of the 1957 Act provided that:\n\n\n13\n'The provisions of section 241 of the Immigration and      Nationality Act relating to the deportation of aliens within      the United States on the ground that they were excludable at      the time of entry as (1) aliens who have sought to procure,      or have procured visas or other documentation, or entry into      the United States by fraud or misrepresentation, or (2)      aliens who were not of the nationality specified in their      visas, shall not apply to an alien otherwise admissible at      the time of entry who (A) is the spouse, parent, or a child      of a United States citizen or of an alien lawfully admitted      for permanent residence; or (B) was admitted to the United      States between December 22, 1945, and November 1, 1954, both      dates inclusive, and misrepresented his nationality, place of      birth, identity, or residence in applying for a visa:      Provided, That such alien described in clause (B) shall      establish to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that      the misrepresentation was predicated upon the alien's fear of      persecution because of race, religion, or political opinion      if repatriated to his former home or residence, and was not      committed for the purpose of evading the quota restrictions      of the immigration laws or an investigation of the alien at      the place of his former home, or residence, or elsewhere.      After the effective date of this Act, any alien who is the      spouse, parent, or a child of a United States citizen or of      an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence and who is      excludable because (1) he seeks, has sought to procure, or      has procured, a visa or other documentation, or entry into      the United States, by fraud or misrepresentation, or (2) he      admits the commission of perjury in connection therewith, shall hereafter be granted a      visa and admitted to the United States for permanent      residence, if otherwise admissible, if the Attorney General      in his discretion has consented to the alien's applying or      reapplying for a visa and for admission to the United      States.'\n\n\n14\nThis section waived deportation under certain circumstances for two classes of aliens who had entered by fraud or misrepresentation. First, an alien who was 'the spouse, parent, or a child of a United States citizen * * *' was saved from deportation for his fraud if he was 'otherwise admissible at the time of entry.' Second, an alien who entered during the postwar period and misrepresented his nationality, place of birth, identity, or residence was saved from deportation if he was 'otherwise admissible at the time of entry' and if he could\n\n\n15\n'establish to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that      the misrepresentation was predicated upon the alien's fear of      persecution because of race, religion, or political opinion      if repatriated to his former home or residence, and was not      committed for the purpose of evading the quota restrictions      of the immigration laws or an investigation of the alien at      the place of his former home, or residence, or elsewhere.'\n\n\n16\nThis language would be meaningless if an alien who committed fraud for the purpose of evading quota restrictions would be deportable as not 'otherwise admissible at the time of entry.' Congress must have felt that aliens who evaded quota restrictions by fraud would be 'otherwise admissible at the time of entry' or it would not have found it necessary to provide further that, in the case of an alien not possessing a close familial relationship to a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident, the fraud must not be for the purpose of evading quota restrictions.\n\n\n17\nThis conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Congress further specified that the aliens who were not close relatives of United States citizens must establish that their fraud was not committed for the purpose of evading an investigation. Fraud for the purpose of evading an investigation, if forgiven by the statute, would clearly leave the alien 'otherwise admissible' if there were no other disqualifying factor. Elementary principles of statutory construction lead to the conclusion that Congress meant to specify two specific types of fraud that would leave an alien 'otherwise admissible' but that would nonetheless bar relief to those aliens who could not claim close relationship with a United States citizen or alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\n\n\n18\nThe present \u00a7 241(f) is essentially a re-enactment of \u00a7 7 of the 1957 Act. The legislative history leaves no doubt that no substantive change in the section was intended.11 The provision dealing with aliens who had entered the United States between 1945 and 1954, and had misrepresented their nationality for fear of persecution or repatriation, was omitted because it had accomplished its purpose; the rest of the section was retained intact.12 It could hardly be argued that Congress intended to change the construction of the statute by this codification.\n\n\n19\nThe intent of \u00a7 7 of the 1957 Act not to require that aliens who are close relatives of United States citizens have complied with quota restrictions to escape deportation for their fraud is clear from its language, and there is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that Congress had in mind a contrary result. The only specific reference to the part of \u00a7 7 that deals with close relatives of United States citizens or residents is in the House Committee Report, and it says only that most of the persons eligible for relief would be\n\n\n20\n'Mexican nationals, who, during the time when border-control      operations suffered from regrettable laxity, were able to      enter the United States, establish a family in this country,      and were subsequently found to reside in the United States      illegally.' H.R.Rep.No.1199, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 11,      U.S.Code Cong., & Admin. News 1957, p. 2024.\n\n\n21\nWithout doubt most of the aliens who had obtained entry into the United States by illegal means were Mexicans, because it has always been far easier to avoid border restrictions when entering from Mexico than when entering from countries that do not have a common land border with the United States. There is nothing in the Committee Report to indicate that relief under the section was intended to be restricted to Mexicans, however. Neither does it follow that, because Mexicans are not subject to quota restrictions, therefore nationals of countries that do have a quota must be within the quota to obtain relief.\n\n\n22\nThe construction of the statute that we adopt in these cases is further reinforced when the section is regarded in the context of the 1957 Act. The fundamental purpose of this legislation was to unite families. Refugees from Communist lands were also benefited, but the Act principally granted relief to persons who would be temporarily or permanently separated from their nearest relatives if the strict requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act, including the national quotas, were not relaxed for them. It was wholly consistent with this purpose of this legislation was to unite immigrants who gained admission by misrepresentation, perhaps many years ago, should not be deported because their countries' quotas were oversubscribed when they entered if the effect of deportation would be to separate families composed in part of American citizens or lawful permanent residents.\n\n\n23\nEven if there were some doubt as to the correct construction of the statute, the doubt should be resolved in favor of the alien. As this Court has held, even where a punitive section is being construed:\n\n\n24\n'We resolve the doubts in favor of that construction because      deportation is a drastic measure and at times the equivalent      of banishment or exile, Delgadillo v. Carmishael, 332 U.S.      388, 68 S.Ct. 10, 92 L.Ed. 17. It is the forfeiture for      misconduct of a residence in this country. Such a forfeiture      is a penalty To construe this statutory provision less      generously to the alien might find support in logic. But      since the stakes are considerable for the individual, we will      not assume that Congress meant to trench on his freedome      beyond that which is required by the narrowest of several      possible meanings of the words used.' Fong Haw Tan v. Phelan,      333 U.S. 6, 10, 68 S.Ct. 374, 376, 92 L.Ed. 433.\n\n\n25\nSee also Barber v. Gonzales, 347 U.S. 637, 642\u2014643, 74 S.Ct. 822, 825\u2014826, 98 L.Ed. 1009. The 1957 Act was not a punitive statute, and \u00a7 7 of that Act, now codified as \u00a7 241(f), in particular was designed to accomplish a humanitarian result. We conclude that to give meaning to the statute in the light of its humanitarian purpose of preventing the breaking up of families composed in part at least of American citizens, the conflict between the circuits must be resolved in favor of the aliens, and that the Errico decision must be affirmed and the Scott decision reversed.\n\n\n26\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n27\nCase No. 54 affirmed.\n\n\n28\nCase No. 91 reversed.\n\n\n29\nMr. Justice STEWART, with whom Mr. Justice HARLAN and Mr. Justice WHITE join, dissenting.\n\n\n30\nThe facts in one of these cases (No. 91) vividly illustrate the effect of the Court's interpretation of \u00a7 241(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The petitioner, a resident of Jamaica, paid for a sham marriage with an American citizen. A ceremony was held, but the petitioner and her 'husband' parted immediately and have not seen each other since. However, the pretended marriage served its purpose; the petitioner was admitted into this country as a nonquota immigrant upon her false representation that she was the wife of a United States citizen. After this fraudulent entry she managed to become the actual parent of a United States citizen by conceiving and bearing an illegitimate child here.\n\n\n31\nThe Court holds that this unsavory series of events gives the petitioner an unqualified right under \u00a7 241(f) to remain in this country ahead of all the honest people waiting in Jamaica and elsewhere to gain lawful entry.1 I can find no support in the statute for such an odd and inequitable result.\n\nSection 241(f) provides as follows:\n\n32\n'The provisions of this section relating to the deportation      of aliens within the United States on the ground that they      were excludable at the time of entry as aliens who have      sought to procure, or have procured visas or other      documentation, or entry into the United States by fraud or      misrepresentation shall not apply to an alien otherwise      admissible at the time of entry who is the spouse, parent, or      a child of a United States citizen or of an alien lawfully      admitted for permanent residence.'\n\n\n33\nIt seems clear to me, for two separate and independently sufficient reasons, that this statute does not operate to bar the deportation of the aliens in the cases now before us. In the first place, \u00a7 241(f) has application only to the deportation provisions which are based upon fraudulent entry, and the aliens in these two cases were not ordered to be deported under those provisions. Secondly, even if it were generally applicable, \u00a7 241(f) does not cover the aliens involved in these two cases, because neither of them was 'otherwise admissible' at the time of entry.\n\nI.\n\n34\nSection 241(f) by its terms neutralizes only those 'provisions * * * relating to the deportation of aliens within the United States on the ground that they * * * sought to procure * * * entry into the United States by fraud or misrepresentation * * *.' Although the aliens in these two cases could have been deported under those 'provisions,' the deportation proceedings in both cases were in fact brought on grounds unrelated to their procurement of fraudulent visas. Both aliens were ordered to be deported, not because of their fraud, but because they were not properly within their countries' quotas.\n\n\n35\nThe plain terms of \u00a7 241(f), therefore, do not even potentially apply to these aliens.2 To hold that \u00a7 241(f) is relevant to these cases is tantamount to holding that it is applicable to bar deportation based on any ground at all so long as the alien lied about that ground at the time of his unlawful entry.3 I think nothing could be further from the statutory language or the congressional purpose.\n\nII.\n\n36\nBut even if \u00a7 241(f) were generally applicable, these aliens could not claim its benefits because they were not within their respective national immigration quotas and therefore were not 'otherwise admissible' at the time they entered the United States. That is the clear import of the statutory qualification, if its words are to be taken at their face value. That, too, has been the uniform and consistent administrative construction of the statute. See Matter of D'O\u2014, 8 I. & N. Dec. 215 (1958); Matter of Slade, 10 I. & N. Dec. 128 (1962).\n\n\n37\nTo except quota requirements of admissibility from the statutory qualification of 'otherwise admissible' would undercut the elaborate quota system which was for years at the heart of the immigration laws. Yet the legislative history of the predecessor of \u00a7 241(f), \u00a7 7 of the 1957 Act, makes clear that the limited relief given by the statute was to have no effect at all on the quota system.4\n\n\n38\nMoreover, the consistent use of the same qualifying phrase, 'otherwise admissible' in other sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act makes clear that, as a term of art, it includes quota admissibility. The term typically follows a definition of grounds for admissibility or for exceptions to deportation, to insure that all the other relevant requirements of the Act are imposed upon the alien.5\n\n\n39\nThus the plain meaning of the 'otherwise admissible' qualification, as well as legislative policy and legislative history, all indicate that the term serves the same basic function in \u00a7 241(f) as in other sections of the Act. Fraud is removed as a ground for deportation of those with the requisite family ties, and 'otherwise admissible' insures the integrity of the remainder of the statutory scheme.6\n\n\n40\nThe Court justifies its disregard of the plain meaning and consistent administrative construction of \u00a7 241(f) by resort to the spirit of humanitarianism which is said to have moved Congress to enact the statute. No doubt Congress in 1957 was concerned with giving relief to some aliens who had entered this country by illegal means and established families here. But the people who were to benefit from this genuine human concern were those from countries like Mexico, which had no quota restrictions, and those who had misrepresented their national origins in order to avoid repatriation to Iron Curtain countries. There is nothing to indicate that Congress enacted this legislation to allow wholesale evasion of the Immigration and Nationality Act or as a general reward for fraud.\n\n\n41\nI respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n 75 Stat. 655 (1961), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(f).\n\n\n2\n Section 211(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 181 (1952), later amended, 79 Stat. 917 (1965), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1181(a) (1964 ed., Supp. I).

(1957).\n\n\n10\n It is in this context that the legislative history cited in the dissent should be understood. The remarks of Senator Eastland and Congressman Celler quoted in footnote 4 of the dissent in context do not refer to \u00a7 7 of the Act but to the provisions of the bill providing for the adoption of alien orphans. Furthermore, Senator Eastland and Congressman Celler did not mean that no exceptions to the quota requirements were intended to be created, because the basic purpose of the bill was to relax the quota system for adopted children and for certain other classes of aliens deemed deserving of relief. They were reassuring their colleagues that no fundamental changes in the quota system were contemplated.\n\n\n11\n H.R.Rep. No. 1086, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 37 (1961), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1961, p. 2950. See also 107 Cong.Rec. 19653\u201419654 (1961) (remarks of Senator Eastland).\n\n\n12\n H.R.Rep. No. 1086, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 37 (1961).\n\n\n1\n When 'Mrs. Scott' made her fraudulent entry in 1958, Jamaica had an annual quota of 100 immigrants and a waiting list of 21,759 hopeful applicants. The corresponding figures for Italy in 1959, the year of Mr. Errico's entry, were 5,666 and 162,612.\n\n\n2\n The Court states that the Government 'concedes' and that 'administrative authorities have consistently held that \u00a7 241(f) waives any deportation charge that results directly from the misrepresentation.' Ante, at p. 217. But this concession and administrative practice fall far short of covering these cases. For here the grounds for deportation did not '(result) directly from the misrepresentation.' They antedated and were the reason for the misrepresentation. The 'administrative authorities' cited by the Court turned upon this distinction. In Matter of Y\u2014-, 8 I. & N.Dec. 143 (1959), for example, the Board of Immigration Appeals broadened \u00a7 241(f) enough to cover fraud-related administrative procedural defects in the alien's entry. It is this construction of \u00a7 241(f) which the Government concedes, not the Court's construction which broadens the statute to excuse all disqualifications for entry.\n\n\n3\n Thus, a Communist who had lied to the immigration authorities about his party membership at the time of entry could invoke \u00a7 241(f) and remain in this country, while one who had told the truth, but was admitted by virtue of an administrative error, could be deported. See \u00a7 212(a)(28), Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\n\n4\n Senator Eastland, Chairman of the Committee which sponsored the 1957 amendments to the Immigration Act, stated, 'the bill does not modify the national origins quota provisions.' 103 Cong.Rec. 15487 (Aug. 21, 1957). See also 103 Cong.Rec. 16300 (Aug. 28, 1957) (remarks of Congressman Celler), '(The bill) makes no changes\u2014no changes whatsoever, in the controversial issue of the national origins quota system.'\nPub.L. 89\u2014236, 79 Stat. 911, made substantial changes in the quota system. But that statute, passed in 1965, hardly indicates a congressional intent in 1957 or in 1961 (when the present statute was revised) to abandon quota requirements.\n\n\n5\n See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 211(a) and (b): The War Brides Act, 59 Stat. 659.\n\n\n6\n Under \u00a7 7 of the 1957 Act certain aliens had to establish both that they were 'otherwise admissible' and that they had not lied to evade quota restrictions. The Court reasons from this that quota restrictions are not embodied in the 'otherwise admissible' qualification. But this reasoning is inconsistent with the Court's conclusion concerning the general applicability of \u00a7 241(f), discussed in Part I of this dissent.\nSection 7 of the earlier Act provided as follows:\n'The provisions of section 241 of the Immigration and Nationality Act relating to the deportation of aliens within the United States on the ground that they were excludable at the time of entry as (1) aliens who have sought to procure, or have procured visas or other documentation, or entry into the United States by fraud or misrepresentation, or (2) aliens who were not of the nationality specified in their visas, shall not apply to an alien otherwise admissible at the time of entry who * * *.' (Emphasis supplied.)\nIf the present meaning of 'otherwise admissible' is to be determined by the 1957 Act, so then must other parts of the statute be similarly determined. Section 241(f) begins with words almost identical to those quoted above. But the second ground of applicability\u2014to 'aliens who were not of the nationality specified in ther visas'\u2014is omitted. Thus, lies about nationality were not forgiven by the first part of the 1957 Act and are not, by the Court's reasoning, excused by \u00a7 241(f), the successor statute. And since there is nothing to distinguish lies about nationality that avoid quota restrictions from other lies with the same effect, the reasoning that leads to the Court's conclusion that the aliens were 'otherwise admissible' leads also to the conclusion that \u00a7 241(f) is not applicable at all in these cases.\n\n\n","label":1}

Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662, it was held that retroactive welfare benefits awarded by a Federal District Court to the plaintiff class, by reason of wrongful denial of benefits by Illinois officials prior to the entry of the court's order determining the wrongfulness of their actions, violated the Eleventh Amendment, and that in an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 \"a federal court's remedial power, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, is necessarily limited to prospective injunctive relief  . . .  and may not include a retroactive award which requires the payment of funds from the state treasury.\"  Edelman, supra, at 677, 94 S.Ct., at 1362.  On remand, the District Court ordered the state officials to send to each member of the plaintiff class a notice informing him that he was denied public assistance to which he was entitled, together with a \"Notice of Appeal\" by which the recipient could request a hearing on the denial of benefits.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the proposed form of notice would have been barred by the Eleventh Amendment, but stated that on remand the District Court could order the state officials to send a \"mere explanatory notice to applicants advising them that there is a state administrative procedure available if they desire to have the state determine whether or not they may be eligible for past benefits,\" and that a returnable notice of appeal could also be provided.  Held:\n1. Neither Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611, the legislative history cited in that decision, nor this Court's Eleventh Amendment cases subsequent to Edelman cast any doubt on Edelman's holding that & 1983 does not abrogate the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the States.  Section 1983 does not explicitly and by clear language indicate on its face an intent to sweep away the immunity of the States;  nor does it have a history which focuses directly on the question of state liability or shows that Congress considered and firmly decided to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the States.  Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522, distinguished.  Nor does this Court's reaffirmance of Edelman in this case render \u00a7 1983 meaningless insofar as States are concerned.  Pp. 338-345. 2. The modified notice contemplated by the Court of Appeals constitutes permissible prospective relief and not a \"retroactive award which requires payment of funds from the state treasury.\" Such notice in effect simply informs plaintiff class members that there are existing administrative procedures by which they may receive a determination of eligibility for past benefits, that their federal suit is at an end, and that the federal court can provide them with no further relief.  Whether a recipient of the notice decides to take advantage of the available procedures is left completely to the discretion of that particular class member, the federal court playing no role in that decision.  And whether or not the class member will receive retroactive benefits rests entirely with the state, its agencies, courts, and legislature, not with the federal court.  Pp. 346-349.\n563 F.2d 873, affirmed.\nWilliam A. Wenzel, III, Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\nSheldon H. Roodman, Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n\n1\nREHNQUIST, Justice.\n\n\n2\nThis case is a sequel to Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), which we decided five Terms ago.  In Edelman we held that retroactive welfare benefits awarded by a Federal District Court to plaintiffs, by reason of wrongful denial of benefits by state officials prior to the entry of the court's order determining the wrongfulness of their actions, violated the Eleventh Amendment.1  The issue now before us is whether that same federal court may, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, order those state officials to send a mere explanatory notice to members of the plaintiff class advising them that there are state administrative procedures available by which they may receive a determination of whether they are entitled to past welfare benefits.  We granted certiorari to resolve an apparent conflict between the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in this case and that of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Fanty v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Dept. of Public Welfare, 551 F.2d 2 (CA3 1977).2  435 U.S. 904, 98 S.Ct. 1447, 55 L.Ed.2d 494 (1978).  We believe that the case as it now comes to us involves little, if any, unbroken ground in this area, and affirm the judgment of the Seventh Circuit.\n\n\n3\nFollowing our remand in Edelman, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, upon motion of the plaintiff, ordered the state officials to send to each member of the plaintiff class a notice informing the recipient: \"[Y]ou were denied public assistance to which you were entitled in the amount of $\u2014\u2014\u2014.\"  Jordan v. Trainor, 405 F.Supp. 802, 809 (1975).3  Enclosed with the required mailing was to be a \"Notice of Appeal,\" which when signed and returned to the Illinois Department of Public Aid, requested a hearing on the denial of benefits.  That notice stated:  \"The department illegally delayed in the processing of my AABD application, and, as a consequence, denied me benefits to which I was and am entitled.\"  Id., at 810.\n\n\n4\nThe Court of Appeals, en banc, found that this proposed form of notice would have been barred by the Eleventh Amendment, since it at least purported to decide that Illinois public funds should be used to satisfy the claims of plaintiff class members without the consent of the State by its appropriate officials.  Jordan v. Trainor, 563 F.2d 873, 875 (1977).4  The court reversed the District Court's order for this reason, but stated that on remand the District Court could order the state officials to send a \"mere explanatory notice to applicants advising them that there is a state administrative procedure available if they desire to have the state determine whether or not they may be eligible for past benefits.  A simple returnable notice of appeal form could also be provided.\"  Ibid.  In the court's view, such a notice would not violate the distinction set forth in Edelman between prospective relief, which is permitted by the Eleventh Amendment, and retrospective relief, which is not:\n\n\n5\n\"The form of notice we envisage would not create a      'liability' against the state.  Whether a liability might      result would be a matter for state determination, not the      federal court.  No federal judgment against the state would      be created.  Such a notice could not be labeled equitable      restitution or be considered an award of damages against the      state.  The defendant makes no issue out of any incidental      administrative expense connected with the preparation or      mailing of the notice.  It has suggested in the record that      the notice could be included in the regular monthly mailing.      The necessary information comes from a computer.  There is no      indication that the administrative expense would be      substantial.\"  563 F.2d, at 876.\n\n\n6\nUnder the contemplated modified notice procedure, the court stated, members of the plaintiff class would be given no more than \"they would have gathered by sitting in the courtroom or by reading and listening to news accounts had the case attracted any attention.\"  Id., at 877-878.5  Three judges dissented on the ground that the majority's revised notice form was barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n\n7\nIn Edelman we reaffirmed the rule that had evolved in our earlier cases that a suit in federal court by private parties seeking to impose a liability which must be paid from public funds in the state treasury is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  415 U.S., at 663, 94 S.Ct., at 1355;  see Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Comm'n, 327 U.S. 573 (1946);  Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, 323 U.S. 459, 65 S.Ct. 347, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945);  Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U.S. 47, 64 S.Ct. 873, 88 L.Ed. 1121 (1944).  We rejected the notion that simply because the lower court's grant of retroactive benefits had been styled \"equitable restitution\" it was permissible under the Eleventh Amendment.  But we also pointed out that under the landmark decision in Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), a federal court, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, may enjoin state officials to conform their future conduct to the requirements of federal law, even though such an injunction may have an ancillary effect on the state treasury. 415 U.S., at 667-668, 94 S.Ct., at 1357-1358;  see Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 289, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 2761, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977);  Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 237, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1686, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974).  The distinction between that relief permissible under the doctrine of Ex parte Young and that found barred in Edelman was the difference between prospective relief on one hand and retrospective relief on the other.6\n\n\n8\nPetitioner state official devotes a significant part of his brief to an attack on the proposed notice which the District Court required the state officials to send.  It is, however, the decision of the Court of Appeals, and not that of the District Court, which we review at the behest of the petitioner.  And just as petitioner insists on tilting at windmills by attacking the District Court's decision, respondent suggests that our decision in Edelman has been eviscerated by later decisions such as Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).  Brief for Respondent 55 n. 37.  See also Aldridge v. Turlington, No. TCA-78-830 (N.D.Fla., Nov. 17, 1978);  but see Skehan v. Board of Trustees of Bloomsburg State College, 590 F.2d 470 (CA3 1978).  As we have noted above, we held in Edelman that in \"a [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1983 action  . . .  a federal court's remedial power, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, is necessarily limited to prospective injunctive relief, Ex parte Young, supra, and may not include a retroactive award which requires the payment of funds from the state treasury, Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, supra.\"  415 U.S., at 677, 94 S.Ct., at 1362.  We disagree with respondent's suggestion.  This Court's holding in Monell was \"limited to local government units which are not considered part of the State for Eleventh Amendment purposes,\" 436 U.S., at 690 n. 54, 98 S.Ct., at 2035 and our Eleventh Amendment decisions subsequent to Edelman and to Monell have cast no doubt on our holding in Edelman.  See Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U.S. 781, 98 S.Ct. 3057, 57 L.Ed.2d 1114 (1978); Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978);  Milliken v. Bradley, supra;  Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 96 S.Ct. 2666, 49 L.Ed.2d 614 (1976);  Scheuer v. Rhodes, supra.7\n\n\n9\nWhile the separate opinions in Hutto v. Finney, supra,8 debated the continuing soundness of Edelman after our decision in Monell, any doubt on that score was largely dispelled by Alabama v. Pugh, supra, decided just 10 days after Hutto.  In Pugh the Court held, over three dissents, that the State of Alabama could not be joined as a defendant without violating the Eleventh Amendment, even though the complaint was based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the claim was a violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments similar to that made in Hutto.  The Court said:\n\n\n10\n\"There can be no doubt, however, that suit against the      State and its Board of Corrections is barred by the Eleventh      Amendment, unless Alabama has consented to the filing of such      a suit.  Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39      L.Ed.2d 662 (1974);  Ford Motor Co. v. Department of      Treasury, 323 U.S. 459, 65 S.Ct. 347, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945);      Worcester County Trust Co. v. Riley, 302 U.S. 292, 58 S.Ct.      185, 82 L.Ed. 268 (1937).\"  438 U.S., at 782, 98 S.Ct., at      3058.9\n\n\n11\nThe decision in Pugh was consistent both with Monell, which was limited to \"local government units,\" 436 U.S., at 690 n. 54, 98 S.Ct., at 2035 n. 54, and with Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, supra. In the latter case we found the \" 'threshold fact of congressional authorization,' \" which had been lacking in Edelman, to be present in the express language of the congressional amendment making Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applicable to state and local governments.  427 U.S., at 452, 96 S.Ct., at 2669, quoting Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S., at 672, 94 S.Ct., at 1360.\n\n\n12\nMr. Justice BRENNAN in his opinion concurring in the judgment argues that our holding in Edelman that \u00a7 1983 does not abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity is \"most likely incorrect.\"  Post, at 354.  To reach this conclusion he relies on \"assum[ptions]\" drawn from the Fourteenth Amendment, post, at 355, on \"occasional remarks\" found in a legislative history that contains little debate on \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, the precursor to \u00a7 1983, post, at 358 n. 15,10 on the reference to \"bodies politic\" in the Act of Feb. 25, 1871, 16 Stat. 431, the \"Dictionary Act,\" post, at 355-35711 and, finally on the general language of \u00a7 1983 itself, post, at 356.  But, unlike our Brother BRENNAN, we simply are unwilling to believe, on the basis of such slender \"evidence,\" that Congress intended by the general language of \u00a7 1983 to override the traditional sovereign immunity of the States.  We therefore conclude that neither the reasoning of Monell or of our Eleventh Amendment cases subsequent to Edelman, nor the additional legislative history or arguments set forth in Mr. Justice BRENNAN's concurring opinion, justify a conclusion different from that which we reached in Edelman.12\n\n\n13\nThere is no question that both the supporters and opponents of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 believed that the Act ceded to the Federal Government many important powers that previously had been considered to be within the exclusive province of the individual States.13  Many of the remarks from the legislative history of the Act quoted in Mr. Justice BRENNAN's opinion amply demonstrate this point.  Post, at 359-365.  See also Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 173-176, 81 S.Ct. 473, 476-478, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961).  But neither logic, the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, nor the legislative history of the 1871 Act compels, or even warrants, a leap from this proposition to the conclusion that Congress intended by the general language of the Act to overturn the constitutionally guaranteed immunity of the several States.14  In Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. 367, 71 S.Ct. 783, 95 L.Ed. 1019 (1951), the Court rejected a similar attempt to interpret the word \"person\" in \u00a7 1983 as a withdrawal of the historic immunity of state legislators.  The Court's words bear repeating here:\n\n\n14\n\"Did Congress by the general language of its 1871      statute mean to overturn the tradition of legislative freedom      achieved in England by Civil War and carefully preserved in      the formation of State and National Governments here?  Did it      mean to subject legislators to civil liability for acts done      within the sphere of legislative activity?  . . .  The limits      of \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the 1871 statute\u2014now \u00a7\u00a7 43 and 47(3) of      Title 8\u2014were not spelled out in debate.  We cannot believe      that Congress\u2014itself a staunch advocate of legislative      freedom\u2014would impinge on a tradition so well grounded in      history and reason by covert inclusion in the general      language before us.\"  341 U.S., at 376, 71 S.Ct., at 788.\n\n\n15\nGiven the importance of the States' traditional sovereign immunity, if in fact the Members of the 42d Congress believed that \u00a7 1 of the 1871 Act overrode that immunity, surely there would have been lengthy debate on this point and it would have been paraded out by the opponents of the Act along with the other evils that they thought would result from the Act.  Instead, \u00a7 1 passed with only limited debate and not one Member of Congress mentioned the Eleventh Amendment or the direct financial consequences to the States of enacting \u00a7 1.  We can only conclude that this silence on the matter is itself a significant indication of the legislative intent of \u00a7 1.\n\n\n16\nOur cases consistently have required a clearer showing of congressional purpose to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity than our Brother BRENNAN is able to marshal.  In Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U.S. 279, 93 S.Ct. 1614, 36 L.Ed.2d 251 (1973), the Court concluded that Congress did not lift the sovereign immunity of the States by enacting the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-219, because of the absence of any indication \"by clear language that the constitutional immunity was swept away.  It is not easy to infer that Congress in legislating pursuant to the Commerce Clause, which has grown to vast proportions in its applications, desired silently to deprive the States of an immunity they have long enjoyed under another part of the Constitution.\"  411 U.S., at 285, 93 S.Ct., at 1618.15  In Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, the Court found present in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq., the \"threshold fact of congressional authorization\" to sue the State as employer, because the statute made explicit reference to the availability of a private action against state and local governments in the event the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the Attorney General failed to bring suit or effect a conciliation agreement.  427 U.S., at 448 n. 1, 449 n. 2, 452, 96 S.Ct., at 2667 n. 1, 2668 n. 2, 2669; see Equal Opportunity Employment Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 105, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1);  H.R.Rep.No.92-238, pp. 17-19 (1971); S.Rep.No.92-415, pp. 9-11 (1971);  S.Conf.Rep.No.92-681, pp. 17-18 (1972);  H.R.Conf.Rep.No.92-899, pp. 17-18 (1972), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1972, p. 2137.  Finally, in Hutto v. Finney, decided just last Term, the Court held that in enacting the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, Congress intended to override the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the States and authorize fee awards payable by the States when their officials are sued in their official capacities.  437 U.S., at 693-694, 98 S.Ct., at 2575-2576.  Although the statutory language in Hutto did not separately impose liability on States in so many words,16 the statute had \"a history focusing directly on the question of state liability; Congress considered and firmly rejected the suggestion that States should be immune from fee awards.\"  Id., at 698 n. 31, 98 S.Ct., at 2578 n. 31.  Also, the Court noted that the statute would have been rendered meaningless with respect to States if the Act did not impose liability for attorney's fees on the States.  Ibid.; see Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., supra, 411 U.S., at 285-286, 93 S.Ct., at 1618-1619.  By contrast, \u00a7 1983 does not explicitly and by clear language indicate on its face an intent to sweep away the immunity of the States;  nor does it have a history which focuses directly on the question of state liability and which shows that Congress considered and firmly decided to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the States.  Nor does our reaffirmance of Edelman render \u00a7 1983 meaningless insofar as States are concerned.  See Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908).17\n\n\n17\nWe turn, then, to the question which has caused disagreement between the Courts of Appeals:  does the modified notice contemplated by the Seventh Circuit constitute permissible prospective relief or a \"retroactive award which requires the payment of funds from the state treasury\"?  We think this relief falls on the Ex parte Young side of the Eleventh Amendment line rather than on the Edelman side.18  Petitioner makes no issue of the incidental administrative expense connected with preparing and mailing the notice.19  Instead, he argues that giving the proposed notice will lead inexorably to the payment of state funds for retroactive benefits and therefore it, in effect, amounts to a monetary award.  But the chain of causation which petitioner seeks to establish is by no means unbroken;  it contains numerous missing links, which can be supplied, if at all, only by the State and members of the plaintiff class and not by a federal court. The notice approved by the Court of Appeals simply apprises plaintiff class members of the existence of whatever administrative procedures may already be available under state law by which they may receive a determination of eligibility for past benefits.  The notice of appeal, we are told, is virtually identical to the notice sent by the Department of Public Aid in every case of a denial or reduction of benefits.  The mere sending of that notice does not trigger the state administrative machinery.  Whether a recipient of notice decides to take advantage of those available state procedures is left completely to the discretion of that particular class member;  the federal court plays no role in that decision.  And whether or not the class member will receive retroactive benefits rests entirely with the State, its agencies, courts, and legislature, not with the federal court.20\n\n\n18\nThe notice approved by the Court of Appeals, unlike that ordered by the District Court, is more properly viewed as ancillary to the prospective relief already ordered by the court. See Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S., at 290, 97 S.Ct., at 2762.  The notice in effect simply informs class members that their federal suit is at an end, that the federal court can provide them with no further relief, and that there are existing state administrative procedures which they may wish to pursue.  Petitioner raises no objection to the expense of preparing or sending it.  The class members are \"given no more  . . .  than what they would have gathered by sitting in the courtroom.\"  Jordan v. Trainor, 563 F.2d, at 877-878.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore\n\n\n19\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n20\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL joins as to Parts I, II, and III, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n21\nFor the reasons set forth in my dissent in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 687, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1367, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), I concur in the judgment of the Court.1\n\n\n22\n* It is deeply disturbing, however, that the Court should engage in today's gratuitous departure from customary judicial practice and reach out to decide an issue unnecessary to its holding.  The Court today correctly rules that the explanatory notice approved by the Court of Appeals below is \"properly viewed as ancillary to  . . .  prospective relief.\"  Ante, at 349.  This is sufficient to sustain the Court's holding that such notice is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  But the Court goes on to conclude, in what is patently dicta, that a State is not a \"person\" for purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Rev.Stat. \u00a7 1979.2\n\n\n23\nThis conclusion is significant because, only three Terms ago, Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 96 S.Ct. 2666, 49 L.Ed.2d 614 (1976), held that \"Congress may, in determining what is 'appropriate legislation' for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, provide for private suits against States or state officials which are constitutionally impermissible in other contexts.\"  Id., at 456, 96 S.Ct., at 2671. If a State were a \"person\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983, therefore, its immunity under the Eleventh Amendment would be abrogated by the statute.3 Edelman v. Jordan, supra, had held that \u00a7 1983 did not override state immunity, for the reason, as the Court later stated in Fitzpatrick, that \"[t]he Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, had been held in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 187-191, 81 S.Ct. 473, 484, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), to exclude cities and other municipal corporations from its ambit;  that being the case, it could not have been intended to include States as parties defendant.\"  427 U.S., at 452, 96 S.Ct., at 2669.4  The premise of this reasoning was undercut last Term, however, when Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), upon re-examination of the legislative history of \u00a7 1983, held that a municipality was indeed a \"person\" for purposes of that statute.5  As I stated in my concurrence in Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 703, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2581, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978), Monell made it \"surely at least an open question whether \u00a7 1983 properly construed does not make the States liable for relief of all kinds, notwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment.\"\n\n\n24\nThe Court's dicta today would close that open question on the basis of Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U.S. 781, 98 S.Ct. 3057, 57 L.Ed.2d 1114 (1978).  In that case the State of Alabama had been named as a party defendant in a suit alleging unconstitutional conditions of confinement.  The question presented was \"[w]hether the mandatory injunction issued against the State of Alabama and the Alabama Board of Corrections violates the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity or exceeds the jurisdiction granted federal courts by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\"  Id., at 782-783, n. 2, 98 S.Ct., at 3058.  The Court held that the State should not have been named as a party defendant.\n\n\n25\nPugh, however, does not stand for the proposition that a State is not a \"person\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983.  Not only does the Court's opinion in that case fail even to mention \u00a7 1983, it frames the issue addressed as whether Alabama had \"consented to the filing of such a suit.\"  438 U.S., at 782, 98 S.Ct., at 3058. Since Alabama's consent would have been irrelevant if Congress had intended States to be encompassed within the reach of \u00a7 1983, the Court apparently decided the first half of the question presented \"[w]hether the mandatory injunction issued against the State of Alabama  . . .  violates the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity\" without considering or deciding the second half\u2014whether the mandatory injunction \"exceeds the jurisdiction granted federal courts by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\"6\n\n\n26\nThis parsing of Pugh is strengthened by a consideration of the circumstances surrounding that decision.  Pugh a short per curiam, was issued on the last day of the Term without the assistance of briefs on the merits or argument.  Alabama's petition for certiorari and respondents' brief in opposition were filed on February 6, 1978, and April 6, 1978, respectively, months before Monell was announced.  They were thus necessarily without the benefit of Monell's major re-evaluation of the legislative history of \u00a7 1983.7  Respondents did not even raise the possibility that Alabama might be a \"person\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983.8  Since the issue is not, as the Court now phrases it, whether the Members of this Court were then aware ofMonell, ante, at 340 n. 9, but rather whether they had before them briefs and arguments detailing the implications of Monell for the question of whether a State is a \"person\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983, it is not anomalous that the Court's opinion in Pugh failed to address or consider this issue.\n\n\n27\nThe Court's reliance on Pugh is particularly significant because the question whether a State is a \"person\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983 is neither briefed nor argued by the parties in the instant case.  Indeed, petitioner states flatly that \"the en banc decision of the Seventh Circuit does not rest upon a conclusion that the term 'person' for purposes of \u00a7 1983 includes sovereign states, as opposed to state officials, within its ambit.  That issue is not the issue before this Court on Petitioner's Writ for Certiorari.\" Reply Brief for Petitioner 14.  Respondent concurs, stating that \"it is unnecessary in this case to confront directly the far-reaching question of whether Congress intended in \u00a7 1983 to provide for relief directly against States, as it did against municipalities.\"  Brief for Respondent 55 n. 37.\n\n\n28\nThus, the Court today decides a question of major significance without ever having had the assistance of a considered presentation of the issue, either in briefs or in arguments.  The result is pure judicial fiat.\n\nII\n\n29\nThis fiat is particularly disturbing because it is most likely incorrect.  Section 1983 was originally enacted as \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871.  The Act was enacted for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.9  That Amendment exemplifies the \"vast transformation\" worked on the structure of federalism in this Nation by the Civil War.  Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225, 242, 92 S.Ct. 2151, 2162, 32 L.Ed.2d 705 (1972). The prohibitions of that Amendment \"are directed to the States  . . ..  They have reference to actions of the political body denominated a State, by whatever instruments or in whatever modes that action may be taken.\"  Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 346-347, 25 L.Ed. 676 (1880).10  The fifth section of the Amendment provides Congress with the power to enforce these prohibitions \"by appropriate legislation.\"  \"Congress, by virtue of the fifth section  . . ., may enforce the prohibitions whenever they are disregarded by either the Legislative, the Executive, or the Judicial Department of the State.  The mode of enforcement is left to its discretion.\"   Virginia v. Rives, 100 U.S. 313, 318, 25 L.Ed. 667 (1880).\n\n\n30\nThe prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment and Congress' power of enforcement are thus directed at the States themselves, not merely at state officers.  It is logical to assume, therefore, that \u00a7 1983, in effectuating the provisions of the Amendment by \"interpos[ing] the federal courts between the States and the people, as guardians of the people's federal rights,\" Mitchum v. Foster, supra, 407 U.S., at 242, 92 S.Ct., at 2162, is also addressed to the States themselves.  Certainly Congress made this intent plain enough on the face of the statute.\n\n\n31\nSection 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 created a federal cause of action against \"any person\" who, \"under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State,\" deprived another of \"any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States.\"  On February 25, 1871, less than two months before the enactment of the Civil Rights Act, Congress provided that \"in all acts hereafter passed  . . .  the word 'person' may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate  . . .  unless the context shows that such words were intended to be used in a more limited sense.\"11  \u00a7 2, 16 Stat. 431.  Monell, held that \"[s]ince there is nothing in the 'context' of the Civil Rights Act calling for a restricted interpretation of the word 'person,' the language of that section should prima facie be construed to include 'bodies politic' among the entities that could be sued.\"  436 U.S., at 689-690 n. 53, 98 S.Ct., at 2035.  Even the Court's opinion today does not dispute the fact that in 1871 the phrase \"bodies politic and corporate\" would certainly have referred to the States.12  See Heim v. McCall, 239 U.S. 175, 188, 36 S.Ct. 78, 82, 60 L.Ed. 206 (1915);  McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U.S. 1, 24, 13 S.Ct. 3, 6, 36 L.Ed. 869 (1892);  Poin- dexter v.

Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, 76-77, 18 L.Ed. 721 (1868);  Butler v. Pennsylvania, 10 How. 402, 416-417, 13 L.Ed. 472 (1851);  Penhallow v. Doane's Administrators, 3 Dall. 54, 92-93, 1 L.Ed. 507 (1795) (Iredell, J.);  Mass. Const., Preamble. Indeed, during the very debates surrounding the enactment of the Civil Rights Act, States were referred to as bodies politic and corporate.  See, e. g., Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 661-662 (1871) (hereinafter Globe) (Sen. Vickers) (\"What is a State?  Is it not a body politic and corporate?\");  cf. id., at 696 (Sen. Edmunds).  Thus the expressed intent of Congress, manifested virtually simultaneously with the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, was that the States themselves, as bodies corporate and politic, should be embraced by the term \"person\" in \u00a7 1 of that Act.\n\n\n32\nThe legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 reinforces this conclusion.  The Act was originally reported to the House as H.R. 320 by Representative Shellabarger.  At that time Representative Shellabarger stated that the bill was meant to be remedial \"in aid of the preservation of human liberty and human rights,\" and thus to be \"liberally and beneficently construed.\"13 Globe App. 68.  The bill was meant to give \"[f]ull force and effect  . . .  to section five\" of the Fourteenth Amendment, Globe 322 (Rep. Stoughton),14 see id., at 800 (Rep. Perry);  Monell, 436 U.S., at 685 n. 45, 98 S.Ct., at 2033 n. 45, and therefore, like the prohibitions of that Amendment, to be addressed against the States themselves.15  See, e. g., Globe 481-482 (Rep. Wilson);  696 (Sen. Edmunds).16  It was, as Representative Kerr who opposed the bill instantly recognized, \"against the rights of the States of this Union.\" Globe App. 46.  Representative Shellabarger, in introducing the bill, made this explicit, stressing the need for \"necessary affirmative legislation to enforce the personal rights which the Constitution guaranties, as between persons in the State and the State itself.\"  Id., at 70.  See, e. g., id., at 80 (Rep. Perry); Globe 375 (Rep. Lowe);  481-482 (Rep. Wilson);  568 (Sen. Edmunds).  Representative Bingham elaborated the point:\n\n\n33\n\"The powers of the States have been limited and the      powers of Congress extended by the last three amendments of      the Constitution.  These last amendments\u2014thirteen, fourteen,      and fifteen\u2014do, in my judgment, vest in Congress a power to      protect the rights of citizens against States, and      individuals in States, never before granted.\n\n\n34\n*          *          *          *          *\n\n\n35\n\"Why not in advance provide against the denial of rights      by States, whether the denial be acts of omission or      commission, as well as against the unlawful acts of      combinations and conspiracies against the rights of the      people?\n\n\n36\n\"The States never had the right, though they had the      power, to inflict wrongs upon free citizens by a denial of the full protection of the laws;  because all State officials      are by the Constitution required to be bound by oath or      affirmation to support the Constitution.  As I have already      said, the States did deny to citizens the equal protection of      the laws, they did deny the rights of citizens under the      Constitution, and except to the extent of the express      limitations upon the States, as I have shown, the citizen had      no remedy.  . . .  They took property without compensation,      and he had no remedy.  They restricted the freedom of the      press, and he had no remedy.  They restricted the freedom of      speech, and he had no remedy.  They restricted the rights of      conscience, and he had no remedy.  They bought and sold men      who had no remedy.  Who dare say, now that the Constitution      has been amended, that the nation cannot by law provide      against all such abuses and denials of right as these in      States and by States, or combination of persons?\"  Globe App.      83, 85 (emphasis added).17\n\n\n37\nH.R. 320 was necessary, as Senator Edmunds stated, to protect citizens \"in the rights that the Constitution gave them  . . .  against any assault by any State or under any State or through the neglect of any State  . . .,\" Globe 697, and by a \"State,\" Edmunds meant \"a corporation  . . .  an organized thing . . .  manifested, represented entirely, and fully in respect to every one of its functions, by that department of its government on which the execution of those functions is respectively devolved.\"  Id., at 696.  See id., at 607-608 (Sen. Pool).\n\n\n38\nIt was common ground, therefore, that, as Representative Wilson argued, the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment were directed against the State, meaning \"the government of the State . . .  the legislative, the judicial, and the executive\";  that the fifth section of the Amendment had given Congress the power to enforce it by \"appropriate legislation,\" meaning \"legislation adequate to meet the difficulties to be encountered to suppress the wrongs existing, to furnish remedies and inflict penalties adequate to the suppression of all infractions of the rights of the citizens\";  and that H.R. 320 was such legislation.  Globe 481-483.  Those who opposed the bill were fully aware of the major implications of such a statute.  Representative Blair, for example, rested his opposition on the fact that the bill, including \u00a7 1, was aimed at the States in their \"corporate and legislative capacity\":\n\n\n39\n\"The inhibitions in the [Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and      Fifteenth] amendments against the United States and the      States are against them in their corporate and legislative      capacities, for the thing or acts prohibited can alone be      performed by them in their corporate or legislative      capacities.\n\n\n40\n*          *          *          *          *\n\n\n41\n\"As the States have the power to violate them and not      individuals, we must presume that the legislation provided      for is against the States in their corporate and legislative      capacity or character and those acting under their laws, and      not against the individuals, as such, of the States.  I am sustained in this view of the case by the tenth      section of the first article of the Constitution of the      United States.  In it are a number of inhibitions against the      States, which it is evident are against them in their      corporate and legislative capacity;  and to which I      respectfully call the attention of the gentlemen who favor      this bill.\"  Globe App. 208.18\n\n\n42\nSee id., at 209.  This conclusion produced an anguished outcry from those committed to unrevised notions of state sovereignty.  Representative Arthur, for example, complained that \u00a7 1\n\n\n43\n\"reaches out and draws within the despotic circle of      central power all the domestic, internal, and local      institutions and offices of the States, and then asserts over      them an arbitrary and paramount control as of the rights,      privileges, and immunities secured and protected, in a      peculiar sense, by the United States in the citizens thereof.      Having done this, having swallowed up the States and their      institutions, tribunals, and functions, it leaves them the      shadow of what they once were.\"  Globe 365.\n\n\n44\nThe answer to such arguments was, of course, that the Civil War had irrevocably and profoundly altered the balance of power between Federal and State Governments:\n\n\n45\n\"If any one thinks it is going too far to give the      United States this national supervisory power to protect the      fundamental rights of citizens of the United States, I do not      agree with him.  It is not wise to permit our devotion to the      reserved rights of the States to be carried so far as to      deprive the citizen of his privileges and immunities.\n\n\n46\n\"We must remember that it was State rights, perverted I      admit from their true significance, that arrayed themselves against the nation and threatened its existence.  We      must remember that it was for the very purpose of placing in      the General Government a check upon this arrogance of some of      the States that the fourteenth amendment was adopted by the      people.  We must remember that, if the legislation we propose      does trench upon what have been, before the fourteenth      amendment, considered the rights of the States, it is in      behalf and for the protection of immunities and privileges      clearly given by the Constitution;  and that Federal laws and      Federal rights must be protected whether domestic laws or      their administration are interfered with or not, because the      Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof are the      supreme law of the land.  We are not making a constitution,      we are enacting a law, and its virtue can be tested without      peril by the experiment.\"  Id., at 502 (Sen. Frelinghuysen).\n\n\n47\nIn the reconstructed union, national rights would be guaranteed federal protection even from the States themselves.\n\nIII\n\n48\nThe plain words of \u00a7 1983, its legislative history and historical context, all evidence that Congress intended States to be embraced within its remedial cause of action.  The Court today pronounces its conclusion in dicta by avoiding such evidence.  It chooses to hear, in the eloquent and pointed legislative history of \u00a7 1983, only \"silence.\"  Such silence is in fact deafening to those who have ears to listen.  But without reason to reach the question, without briefs, without argument, relying on a precedent that was equally ill-informed and in any event not controlling, the Court resolutely opines that a State is not a \"person\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983.  The 42d Congress, of course, can no longer pronounce its meaning with unavoidable clarity.  Fitzpatrick, however, cedes to the present Congress the power to rectify this erroneous misinterpretation.  It need only make its intention plain.\n\n\n49\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n50\nI concur in the judgment of the Court, for the reasons expressed in my dissenting opinion in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 688, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1368, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), and my concurring opinion in Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U.S. 279, 287, 93 S.Ct. 1614, 1619, 36 L.Ed.2d 251 (1973). Moreover, I agree that an affirmance here follows logically from the Court's decision in Edelman, because the explanatory notice approved by the Court of Appeals clearly is ancillary to prospective relief.  But given that basis for deciding the present case, it is entirely unnecessary for the Court to address the question whether a State is a \"person\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1983.  Accordingly, I join Parts I, II, and III of my Brother BRENNAN's opinion.\n\n\n\n1\n The history of this case is set forth in greater detail in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).\n\n\n2\n In Fanty, the plaintiff class alleged that the manner in which the defendant state officials had collected class members' federal benefits in reimbursement of amounts granted under state welfare laws violated this Court's decision in Philpott v. Essex County Welfare Board, 409 U.S. 413, 93 S.Ct. 590, 34 L.Ed.2d 608 (1973).  The District Court agreed, and while it denied retroactive relief against the State on the basis of Edelman v. Jordan, supra, it did require the defendant state officials to notify plaintiff class members that under Philpott they have no legal obligation to make reimbursement out of their federal disability benefits and that as a matter of state law they may have a cause of action against the Department of Public Welfare for refund of prior payments.  The Court of Appeals, in three separate opinions, reversed.  Chief Judge Seitz was of the opinion that the notice relief was barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Judge Garth, concurring in the result, believed that the Eleventh Amendment issue was \"borderline,\" 551 F.2d, at 6, but voted to reverse on the basis that there was no case or controversy.  Judge Hunter dissented on grounds not relevant here.  However, he disagreed with Chief Judge Seitz that the Eleventh Amendment prohibited the notice relief.\n\n\n3\n Because this was a class action qualifying under Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23(b)(2), the class members had never received notice of the complaint, the original lower court judgment, this Court's decision or its effect on them.  See Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177 n. 14, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 2152 n. 14, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974);  Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23(e).  Under Rule 23(d)(2), however, a court may require appropriate notice \"for the protection of the members of the class or otherwise for the fair conduct of the action.\"\nPrior to ordering notice, the District Court requested the parties to submit information with respect to the number of persons in the plaintiff class, the cost of notifying them, the amounts involved, and other issues affecting the equities of sending notice.  Respondent filed his response to the court's request but the state officials submitted no response.  Respondent indicated that there were approximately 20,000 to 33,500 members in the plaintiff class.  App. 34a.  The cost of identifying class members was stated to be simply the cost of running the department's computer for a period necessary to cull out the names of the plaintiff class members.  Respondent claimed that there would be no additional cost of notifying class members because the notice could be included in one of the regular mailings to the members of the plaintiff class.  Petitioner has not disputed respondent's allegations either below or before this Court.\n\n\n4\n A panel of the Seventh Circuit originally had reversed the District Court's order requiring notice on the ground that the Eleventh Amendment was a \"jurisdictional bar to the exercise of federal judicial power concerning past action or inaction of a state with respect to the Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled Program.\"  Jordan v. Trainor, 551 F.2d 152, 155 (1977).\n\n\n5\n In reaching its decision, the Seventh Circuit relied in part on our summary affirmance of Grubb v. Sterrett, 315 F.Supp. 990 (N.D.Ind.), aff'd, 400 U.S. 922, 91 S.Ct. 187, 27 L.Ed.2d 182 (1970), in which the District Court had ordered Indiana public assistance officials to send to plaintiff class members a notice similar to the one at issue here.  As the Court of Appeals recognized, the list of summary affirmances overruled in Edelman was not necessarily intended to be exhaustive.  See Jordan v. Trainor, 563 F.2d, at 876.  However, we prefer to rest our affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case on our conclusion that it is consistent with Edelman.\n\n\n6\n As we stated in Edelman:\n\"[T]hat portion of the District Court's decree which petitioner challenges on Eleventh Amendment grounds goes much further than [Ex parte Young and the cases that had followed it]. It requires payment of state funds, not as a necessary consequence of compliance in the future with a substantive federal-question determination, but as a form of compensation to those whose applications were processed on the slower time schedule at a time when petitioner was under no court-imposed obligation to conform to a different standard.  . . .  It will to a virtual certainty be paid from state funds, and not from the pockets of the individual state officials who were the defendants in the action.  It is measured in terms of a monetary loss resulting from a past breach of a legal duty on the part of the defendant state officials.\" 415 U.S., at 668, 94 S.Ct., at 1358.\n\n\n7\n Mr. Justice BRENNAN's opinion concurring in the judgment states that \"Edelman v. Jordan, supra, had held that \u00a7 1983 did not override state immunity, for the reason, as the Court later stated in Fitzpatrick, that '[t]he Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, had been held in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 187-191, 81 S.Ct. 473, 484, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), to exclude cities and other municipal corporations from its ambit;  that being the case, it could not have been intended to include States as parties defendant.' \"  Post, at 351.  Since Monell overruled Monroe's holding that cities and other municipal corporations are not \"persons\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1983, Mr. Justice BRENNAN's opinion argues that the \"premise\" of Edelman has been \"undercut.\" Post, at 351.  The fallacy of this line of reasoning was aptly demonstrated last Term by Mr. Justice POWELL in his concurring opinion in Hutto, where he stated:  \"The language in question from Fitzpatrick was not essential to the Court's holding in that case. Moreover, this position ignores the fact that Edelman rests squarely on the Eleventh Amendment immunity, without adverting in terms to the treatment of the legislative history in Monroe v. Pape  . . . .\"  437 U.S., at 708-709, n. 6, 98 S.Ct., at 2583-2584, n. 6.  In fact, Monroe v. Pape is not even cited in Edelman.\n\n\n8\n In Hutto v. Finney, there were three separate opinions in addition to that of the Court.  Two opinions expressed the view that the Court had misapplied the rule laid down in Edelman.  437 U.S., at 704, 98 S.Ct., at 2581 (POWELL, J., concurring and dissenting);  id., at 710, 98 S.Ct., at 2584 (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting).  Mr. Justice BRENNAN, though joining the opinion of the Court, wrote separately to suggest that the Court's opinions in Monell, and Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, had rendered \"the essential premise of our Edelman holding  . . .  no longer true.\"  437 U.S., at 703, 98 S.Ct., at 2580.  The Court itself in Hutto, however, recognized and applied Edelman's distinction between retrospective and prospective relief.\n\n\n9\n Our Brother BRENNAN in his opinion concurring in the judgment curiously suggests that the language quoted from Pugh in the text could not mean what it, on its face, says, because the briefs in the case were filed before our decision in Monell was announced.  Post, at 352-354.  But while the parties in Pugh were \"without the benefit of Monell \u00a7 major re-evaluation of the legislative history of \u00a7 1983,\" post, at 352-353, the Members of this Court labored under no similar disability.  The decision in Pugh was handed down nearly one month after Monell and 10 days after Hutto, where separate opinions debated this precise point. If, after Monell and Hutto, this Court harbored any doubts about the continued validity of Edelman \u00a7 conclusion that \u00a7 1983 does not constitute a waiver of the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the States, it is inconceivable that the Court would have taken the extraordinary action of summarily reversing a lower court on the basis of Edelman.\n\n\n10\n There was only limited debate on \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, and it passed without amendment.  Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S., at 665, 98 S.Ct., at 2023.  The sections that drew most of the debate were those that created certain federal crimes, permitted the President to send the militia to any State with widespread Ku Klux Klan violence, and authorized suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in certain circumstances.  Id., at 665 n. 11, 98 S.Ct., at 2023 n. 11.\n\n\n11\n The Dictionary Act was intended to provide a \"few general rules for the construction of statutes.\"  Cong.Globe, 41st Cong., 3d Sess., 1474 (1871) (remarks of Rep. Poland).  While it was enacted two months before the enactment of the 1871 Civil Rights Act, it came more than five years after passage of \u00a7 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, which served as the model for the language of \u00a7 1 of the 1871 Act.  Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 68 (1871) (remarks of Rep. Shellabarger);  see Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 183-185, 81 S.Ct. 473, 481-483, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961);  post, at 362 n. 17.\n\n\n12\n Mr. Justice BRENNAN's opinion characterizes this conclusion as \"gratuitous\" and \"paten[t] dicta.\"  Post, at 350. But we cannot think of a more \"gratuitous\" or useless exercise of this Court's discretionary jurisdiction than to decide which of two conflicting interpretations of Edelman v. Jordan is correct, if in truth we believed that Edelman itself no longer were valid. The question does not arise out of the blue;  it was extensively discussed in our brother BRENNAN's concurrence in Hutto v. Finney last Term.  We therefore fail to see how our reaffirmance of Edelman can be characterized as \"dicta.\"\n\n\n13\n For example, the Act was attacked as an attempt to strip States of the power to punish and proscribe offenses within their borders, e. g., Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 396 (1871) (remarks of Rep. Rice);  id., at App. 112 (remarks of Rep. Moore); id., at App. 117 (remarks of Sen. Blair), and of their authority to decide when the militia of the United States should be called into their territory to quell domestic disturbances, e. g., id., at 647 (remarks of Sen. Davis);  id., at App. 139 (remarks of Rep. McCormick).\n\n\n14\n Indeed the Prigg-Dennison-Day line of cases, relied on so heavily in Monell would surely militate against such a conclusion. 436 U.S., at 672-683, 98 S.Ct., at 2027-2032;  see Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. (41 U.S.) 539, 10 L.Ed. 1060 (1842); Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. (65 U.S.) 66, 16 L.Ed. 717 (1861); Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. (78 U.S.) 113, 20 L.Ed. 122 (1871). Our Brother BRENNAN's concurrence in the judgment today relies on Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 25 L.Ed. 676 (1880), and on Virginia v. Rives, 100 U.S. 313, 25 L.Ed. 667 (1880).  But these cases were decided nearly a decade after the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, and as noted in Monell substantially undercut the Prigg-Dennison-Day line of cases for purposes of enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment.  436 U.S., at 676, 98 S.Ct., at 2028.  But (as was noted in Monell ), it was the Prigg-Dennison-Day line of cases that was \"the reigning constitutional theory of [the] day\" when the Civil Rights Act of 1871 was debated and enacted.  436 U.S., at 676, 98 S.Ct., at 2028.\n\n\n15\n The Court in Employees \"found not a word in the history of the [statute] to indicate a purpose of Congress to make it possible for a citizen of that State or another State to sue the State in the federal courts.\"  411 U.S., at 285, 93 S.Ct., at 1618.  The Court also added that its interpretation of the law did not render the statute's inclusion of state institutions meaningless.  Id., at 285-286, 93 S.Ct., at 1618-1619.\n\n\n16\n While Hutto, unlike Fitzpatrick and Employees, did not require an express statutory waiver of the State's immunity, 437 U.S., at 695, 698 n. 31, 98 S.Ct., at 2576, 2578 n. 31, the Court was careful to emphasize that it was concerned only with expenses incurred in litigation seeking prospective relief while the other cases involved retroactive liability for prelitigation conduct. Id., at 695, 98 S.Ct., at 2576.  The Court also noted that it was not concerned with a statute that imposed \" 'enormous fiscal burdens on the States' \" and that if it were, it might require a formal indication of Congress' intent to abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity, as did Employees and Fitzpatrick. 437 U.S., at 697 n. 27, 98 S.Ct., at 2027 n. 27.  Extending \u00a7 1983 liability to States obviously would place \"enormous fiscal burdens on the States.\"  But we need not reach the question whether an express waiver is required because neither the language of the statute nor the legislative history discloses an intent to overturn the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity by imposing liability directly upon them.\n\n\n17\n The arguments in Mr. Justice BRENNAN's opinion regarding Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat.  (22 U.S.) 738, 6 L.Ed. 204 (1824), are similarly unpersuasive.  Post, at 359-361, n. 16.  Mr. Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in Osborn makes it clear that in determining whether a court can grant relief the key inquiry is whether the state officer was in fact the real party in interest or whether he was only a nominal party.  9 Wheat., at 858.  See also Bank of United States v. Planters' Bank of Georgia, 9 Wheat. 904, 907, 6 L.Ed. 244 (1824).  Mr. Chief Justice Marshall emphasized this precise point just four years later in his opinion for the Court in Governor of Georgia v. Madrazo, 1 Pet. 110, 7 L.Ed. 73 (1828).  In Mandrazo, a vessel carrying slaves was seized and the\nslaves were delivered into the possession of the Governor of Georgia.  The slaves were sold and the proceeds were placed in the state treasury.  Mandrazo filed a libel in the Federal District Court, naming the Governor of Georgia, among others, as a defendant.  Restitution was ordered by the lower courts, but this Court reversed because although the demand for relief nominally was against the Governor of the State, it was clear that the action in fact sought relief directly from the state treasury, relief that was forbidden by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\"The claim upon the governor, is as a governor;  he is sued, not by his name, but by his title.  The demand made upon him, is not made personally, but officially.\n\"The decree is pronounced not against the person, but the officer, and appeared to have been pronounced against the successor of the original defendant;  as the appealed bond was executed by a different governor from him who filed the information.  In such a case, where the chief magistrate of a state is sued, not by his name, but by his style of office, and the claim made upon him is entirely in his official character, we think the state itself may be considered as a party on the record. If the state is not a party, there is no party against whom a decree can be made.  No person in his natural capacity is brought before the Court as defendant.  This not being a proceeding against the thing, but against the person, a person capable of appearing as a defendant, against whom a decree can be pronounced, must be a party to the cause before a decree can be regularly pronounced.\"  Id., at 123-124 (emphasis added).\nTo similar effect see Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How., at 97-98, which reaffirmed these principles of Mandrazo and which, as the Court in Monell emphasized, was \"well known to Members of Congress\" at the time of the passage of the 1871 Act.  436 U.S., at 679, 98 S.Ct., at 2568.  To the extent that Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203, 24 L.Ed. 447 (1873), which did no more than affirm an injunctive decree against a state official, is inconsistent with the rule applied in Edelman, it suffices to say that it was repudiated long before the latter decision.  In Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, 323 U.S. 459, 65 S.Ct. 347, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945), the Court stated:\n\"[W]hen the action is in essence one for the recovery of money from the state, the state is the real, substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its sovereign immunity from suit even though individual officials are nominal defendants.\" Id., at 464, 65 S.Ct., at 350.\n\n\n18\n In addition to petitioner's Eleventh Amendment arguments, he contends that the Court of Appeals' notice violates the law of the case as established in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).  We disagree.  The doctrine of law of the case comes into play only with respect to issues previously determined.  In re Sanford Fork & Tool Co., 160 U.S. 247, 16 S.Ct. 291, 40 L.Ed. 414 (1895).  On remand, the \"Circuit Court may consider and decide any matters left open by the mandate of this court.\"  Id., at 256, 16 S.Ct., at 293.  Accord, Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, 254 U.S. 175, 41 S.Ct. 93, 65 L.Ed. 205 (1920).  The Court in Edelman considered the constitutionality only of the relief before it.  415 U.S., at 665, 94 S.Ct., at 1356.  It was not presented with the question of the propriety of notice relief.  Petitioner also claims that the District Court lacked power to order notice under the terms of this Court's remand.  The simple answer to this contention is that we remanded the matter in Edelman \"for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,\" and we hold today that the award of notice relief, as fashioned by the Court of Appeals, is not inconsistent with either the spirit or express terms of our decision in Edelman. \"While a mandate is controlling as to matters within its compass, on the remand a lower court is free as to other issues.\"  Sprague v. Ticonic National Bank, 307 U.S. 161, 168, 59 S.Ct. 777, 781, 83 L.Ed. 1184 (1939), citing In re Sanford Fork & Tool Co., supra.\n\n\n19\n It appears from respondent's answers to a District Court request that any expense associated with the preparation and mailing of the notice would be de minimis.  See n. 3, supra.\n\n\n20\n As of January 1, 1974, the Aid to the Aged, Blind, and Disabled program was replaced by a completely federal-funded Supplemental Security Income program.  Pub.L. 92-603, Title III, \u00a7 301, 86 Stat. 1465.  Petitioner argues that the notice relief is impermissible because if retroactive benefits ultimately are awarded to the plaintiff class members, there is little likelihood that the Federal Government will reimburse the State for assistance payments made relating to a now defunct program.  Thus, Illinois would have to bear the total cost of such retroactive payments.  This fact may well be relevant to the state agency's or court's determination of whether to award retroactive benefits. But since the notice relief does not constitute a money judgment, it is not at all relevant to the question of the propriety of the notice fashioned by the Court of Appeals.\nPetitioner also states that even if the Department of Public Aid determines to grant retroactive relief, it may not request the Comptroller to draw, or the Treasurer to make payments from, funds appropriated for a current fiscal year for an outstanding obligation incurred during a prior fiscal year without the express authorization from the legislature.  See Reply Brief for State Petitioner 5.  Thus, as a result of the lapse of Public Aid appropriations for fiscal years 1968, 1969, 1970, and 1971, petitioner claims that members of the plaintiff class would be required to resort to filing claims against the State in the Illinois Court of Claims.  These facts may influence a plaintiff class member in deciding whether to pursue existing state remedies or the legislature in determining whether to give its approval to a payment of retroactive benefits, but they do not affect our conclusion that the notice relief awarded here is permissible under the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n\n1\n In Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S., at 687-688, 94 S.Ct., at 1367-1368, I stated:\n\"This suit is brought by Illinois citizens against Illinois officials.  In that circumstance, Illinois may not invoke the Eleventh Amendment, since that Amendment bars only federal court suits against States by citizens of other States.  Rather, the question is whether Illinois may avail itself of the nonconstitutional but ancient doctrine of sovereign immunity as a bar to respondent's claim for retroactive AABD payments.  In my view Illinois may not assert sovereign immunity for the reason I expressed in dissent in Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U.S. 279, 298, 93 S.Ct. 1614, 1625, 36 L.Ed.2d 251 (1973): the States surrendered that immunity in Hamilton's words, 'in the plan of the Convention,' that formed the Union, at least insofar as the States granted Congress specifically enumerated powers. See id., at 319 n. 7, 93 S.Ct., at 1635 n. 7;  Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U.S. 184, 84 S.Ct. 1207, 12 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964). Congressional authority to enact the Social Security Act, of which AABD is a part, former 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-1385 (now replaced by similar provisions in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-804 (1970 ed., Supp.II), is to be found in Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1, one of the enumerated powers granted Congress by the States in the Constitution.  I remain of the opinion that 'because of its surrender, no immunity exists that can be the subject of a congressional declaration or a voluntary waiver,' 411 U.S., at 300, 93 S.Ct., at 1626, and thus have no occasion to inquire whether or not Congress authorized an action for AABD retroactive benefits, or whether or not Illinois voluntarily waived the immunity by its continued participation in the program against the background of precedents which sustained judgments ordering retroactive payments.\"\n\n\n2\n Section 1983 states:\n\"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\"\n\n\n3\n There is no question but that \u00a7 1983 was enacted by Congress under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Section 1983 was originally the first section of an Act entitled \"An Act to enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States  . . . .\"  17 Stat. 13.\n\n\n4\n This reasoning had been employed by several lower courts which had considered this question.  See, e. g., United States ex rel. Gittlemacker v. County of Philadelphia, 413 F.2d 84, 86 n. 2 (CA3 1969) (\"In view of the Supreme Court's holding in Monroe v. Pape  . . .  that a municipal corporation is not a 'person' subject to suit within the meaning of the Civil Rights Act, the conclusion that states are not persons within the meaning of the Act is inescapable\");  Williford v. California, 352 F.2d 474, 476 (CA9 1965).\n\n\n5\n For a discussion of the implications of Monell for this question, see Aldridge v. Turlington, Civ. Act. No. TCA-78-830 (ND Fla., Nov. 17, 1978).\n\n\n6\n This is what I take to be the significance of the observation of my Brother STEVENS in Pugh :\n\"Surely the Court does not intend to resolve summarily the issue debated by my Brothers in their separate opinions in Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 700 [98 S.Ct. 2565, 2579, 57 L.Ed.2d 522] (BRENNAN, J., concurring), and 708-709 n. 6 [98 S.Ct. 2583 n. 6] (POWELL, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\"  438 U.S., at 783 n. * [98 S.Ct., at 3058 n. *] (1978) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).  Cf. The Supreme Court, 1977 Term, 92 Harv.L.Rev. 57, 325-326 (1978).\n\n\n7\n Indeed, the entire discussion of the issue in the petition for certiorari is as follows:\n\"The grant of an injunction against the State and the Board of Corrections in an action based upon 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 is in direct conflict with decisions of other courts of appeal which hold that neither a State nor a State agency is a 'person' within the meaning of the statute and amenable to suit under it. Meredith v. Arizona, 523 F.2d 481 (9th Cir. 1975);  Curtis v. Everette, 489 F.2d 516 (3rd Cir. 1973).  The decisions below conflict, at least in principle, with this Court's holding in City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U.S. 507, 93 S.Ct. 2222, 37 L.Ed.2d 109 (1973), that municipalities are not 'persons' under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\"  Pet. for Cert. in Alabama v. Pugh, O.T. 1977, No. 77-1107, pp. 11-12.\n\n\n8\n The discussion of the issue by the respondents in Pugh was unilluminating:\n\"Supreme Court Rule 19(1) states that certiorari will only be 'granted where there are special and important reasons therefor.'  The second issue raised by the Petitioners challenges the injunction against the State of Alabama and the Alabama Board of Corrections alleging:  (1) each is immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment;  (2) neither is a 'person' subject to 42 U.S.C. 1983 jurisdiction;  and (3) Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 [94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662] (1974) and Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 [28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714] (1908) bar judgments against the State for prospective costs of compliance with an order. Under the facts of these cases, the questions presented are not only unimportant but are essentially irrelevant.\n\"First, additional defendants enjoined include all members of the Alabama Board of Corrections and numerous other prison officials who would clearly remain bound by the injunction issued, Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232 [94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90] (1974);  Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 [94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662] (1974) and have the authority in their official capacity to carry out the court's orders.  Second, the State of Alabama and the Board of Corrections were only named defendants in the Pugh case and not the James case.  Therefore, any action taken on this issue in Pugh would not affect the same relief granted in James.  Third, this issue was never thought important enough by counsel for the petitioners to raise, brief or argue in the trial court.  Fourth, the Court of Appeals did not see fit to speak to this issue at all.  Fifth, whether the State of Alabama and\/or the Board of Corrections are enjoined in addition to the members of the Board of Corrections has absolutely no practical effect on what has happened or will happen under the court's order.\"  Brief in Opposition in Alabama v. Pugh, O.T. 1977, No. 77-1107, pp. 9-10.\n\n\n9\n See n. 3, supra.\n\n\n10\n \"We have said the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment are addressed to the States.  They are, 'No State shall make or enforce a law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States,  . . .  nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.' \"  100 U.S., at 346.\n\"It is these which Congress is empowered to enforce, and to enforce against State action, however put forth, whether that action be executive, legislative, or judicial.  Such enforcement is no invasion of State sovereignty.  No law can be, which the people of the States have, by the Constitution of the United States, empowered Congress to enact.\"  Ibid.\n\n\n11\n Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), held that the word \"may\" in the Act was to be interpreted as the equivalent of \"shall\":  \"Such a mandatory use of the extended meanings of the words defined by the Act is  . . .  required for it to perform its intended function\u2014to be a guide to 'rules of construction' of Acts of Congress.  See [Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 3d Sess., 775 (1871)] (remarks of Sen. Trumbull).\"  Id., at 689 n. 53, 98 S.Ct., at 2035.\n\n\n12\n The phrase would also have referred to the United States. As Mr. Chief Justice Marshall stated:  \"The United States is a government, and, consequently, a body politic and corporate  . . ..\"  United States v. Maurice, 26 Fed.Cas. No. 15747, 2 Brock. 96, 109 (CC Va.1823).  See Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, 117 U.S. 151, 154, 6 S.Ct. 670, 672, 29 L.Ed. 845 (1886);  Dugan v. United States, 3 Wheat. 172, 178, 4 L.Ed. 362 (1818) (argument of Attorney General William Wirt).\nIn construing the meaning of the term \"person\" in a Texas law creating a statute of limitations for suits to recover real estate \"as against any person in peaceable and adverse possession thereof,\" this Court stated:\n\"Of course, the United States were not bound by the laws of the State, yet the word 'person' in the statute would include them as a body politic and corporate.  Sayles, Art. 3140;  Martin v. State, 24 Texas, 61, 68.\"   Stanley v. Schwalby, 147 U.S. 508, 514, 517, 13 S.Ct. 418, 422, 37 L.Ed. 259 (1893).\nSee United States v. Shirey, 359 U.S. 255, 257 n. 2, 79 S.Ct. 746, 747 n. 2, 3 L.Ed.2d 789 (1959);  Ohio v. Helvering, 292 U.S. 360, 370, 54 S.Ct. 725, 727, 78 L.Ed. 1307 (1934);  cf. Pfizer Inc. v. India, 434 U.S. 308, 315-316 n. 15, 98 S.Ct. 584, 589 n. 15, 54 L.Ed.2d 563 (1978).\n\n\n13\n Monell, supra, stated that \"there can be no doubt that \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act was intended  . . .  to be broadly construed  . . . .\"  436 U.S., at 700, 98 S.Ct., at 2041.  See Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U.S. 391, 399-400, and n. 17, 99 S.Ct. 1171, 1176-1177, and n. 17, 59 L.Ed.2d 401 (1979).  Senator Thurman of Ohio, who opposed the Act, stated with respect to \u00a7 1 that \"there is no limitation whatsoever upon the terms that are employed, and they are as comprehensive as can be used.\"  Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 217 (1871) (hereinafter Globe App.) (emphasis added).\n\n\n14\n One of the reasons given by the Court in Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978), for not requiring an \"express statutory waiver of the State's immunity,\" ante, at 344 n. 16, before applying to the States the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, was that the Act had been \"enacted to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.\"  437 U.S., at 698 n. 31, 98 S.Ct., at 2578.\n\n\n15\n It was common ground, at least after the Fourteenth Amendment, that Congress could \"dea[l] with States and with citizens.\"  Globe 777 (Sen. Frelinghuysen).  See id., at 793 (Rep. Poland).  Representative Willard of Vermont, for example, who voted for H.R. 320, opposed the Sherman amendment, which would have held a municipal corporation liable for damages to its inhabitants by private persons \" 'riotously and tumultuously assembled,' \" Monell, supra, at 664, 98 S.Ct., at 2022, on the grounds that the Fourteenth Amendment imposed liability directly on the States and not on such municipal corporations:\n\"I hold that this duty of protection, if it rests anywhere, rests on the State, and that if there is to be any liability visited upon anybody for a failure to perform that duty, such liability should be brought home to the State.  Hence, in my judgment, this section would be liable to very much less objection, both in regard to its justice and its constitutionality, if it provided that if in any State the offenses named in this section were committed, suit might be brought against the State, judgment obtained, and payment of the judgment might be enforced upon the treasury of the State.\"  Globe 791.\nSee id., at 756-757 (Sen. Edmunds).\nThere was general agreement, however, that just as Congress could not impose affirmative obligations on municipalities, Monell, supra, at 681 n. 40, 98 S.Ct., at 2031, n. 40, so it could not \"command a State officer to do any duty whatever, as such.\"  Globe 795 (Rep. Blair).  See id., at 799 (Rep. Farnsworth);  Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113 (1871);  Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 16 L.Ed. 717 (1861);  Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 539, 10 L.Ed. 1060 (1842).  Contrary to the suggestion of the Court, ante, at 341 n. 14, however, the Prigg-Dennison-Day line of cases, which stands for the principle that \"the Federal Government  . . .  has no power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever,\" 24 How., at 107, no more \"militate[s] against\" the conclusion that States are \"persons\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983, than it militates against the conclusion that municipalities are such persons.  Everyone agreed, after all, that state officers, as such, would be subject to liability for violations of \u00a7 1983.  The doctrine of coordinate sovereignty, relied on in the Prigg-Dennison-Day line of cases, would not have distinguished between such liability and the liability of the State itself.  See Monell, 436 U.S., at 682, 98 S.Ct., at 2031.\n\n\n16\n A view of the reach of \u00a7 1 suggested by occasional remarks in the legislative history of H.R. 320 to the effect that \"[t]he Government can act only upon individuals,\" Globe App. 251 (Sen. Morton), was rejected last Term when Monell held that municipalities were \"persons\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983.  It was a view colored by the belief that, since a \"State always acts through instrumentalities,\" Globe 334 (Rep. Hoar), State violations of the Fourteenth Amendment could most effectively be reached through imposing liability on the state officials through whom States acted.  As Representative Burchard stated:\n\"In the enforcement of the observance of duties imposed directly upon the people by the Constitution, the General Government applies the law directly to persons and individual acts.  It may punish individuals for interference with its prerogatives and infractions of the rights it is authorized to protect.  For the neglect or refusal of a State to perform a constitutional duty, the remedies and power of enforcement given to the General Government are few and restricted.  It cannot perform the duty the Constitution enjoins upon the State.  If a State fails to appoint presidential electors, or its Legislature to choose Senators, or its people to elect Representatives, Congress cannot act for them.  Nor do prohibitions upon States authorize Congress to exercise the forbidden power.  It may doubtless require State officers to discharge duties imposed upon them as such officers by the Constitution of the United States.  A State office must be assumed with such limitations and burdens, such duties and obligations, as the Constitution of the United States attaches to it.  The General Government cannot punish the State, but the officer who violates his official constitutional duty can be punished under Federal law.  What more appropriate legislation for enforcing a constitutional prohibition upon a State than to compel State officers to observe it?  Its violation by the\nState can only be consummated through the officers by whom it acts.\"  Globe App. 314.\nIt is noteworthy that, even under this view, \u00a7 1983 would abrogate the Eleventh Amendment immunity of States to the extent necessary to provide full relief for any plaintiff suing a state officer.  Cf. Globe 365-366 (Rep. Arthur);  385 (Rep. Lewis); Globe App. 217 (Sen. Thurman).  Thus, even if this limited approach had emerged out of concern for the Eleventh Amendment immunity of States, the distinction \"between prospective relief on one hand and retrospective relief on the other,\" ante, at 337, which was drawn by Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), would be eliminated by the congressional enactment of \u00a7 1983.  This is not anomalous, however, since the 42d Congress would have had no way to anticipate Edelman's distinction, and would much more probably have had in mind the decision of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 6 L.Ed. 204 (1824), which held:\n\"It may, we think, be laid down as a rule which admits of no exception, that, in all cases where jurisdiction depends on the party, it is the party named in the record.  Consequently, the 11th amendment, which restrains the jurisdiction granted by the constitution over suits against States, is, of necessity, limited to those suits in which a State is a party on the record.  The amendment has its full effect, if the constitution be construed as it would have been construed, had the jurisdiction of the Court never been extended to suits brought against a State, by the citizens of another State, or by aliens.\n\"The State not being a party on the record, and the Court having jurisdiction over those who are parties on the record, the true question is, not one of jurisdiction, but whether, in the exercise of its jurisdiction, the Court ought to make a decree against the defendants;  whether they are to be considered as having a real interest, or as being only nominal parties.\"  Id., at 857-858.\nFour years later the Court, again per Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, stated that a suit against the office, as opposed to the person, of the Governor of a State had the effect of making the State a party of record, Governor of Georgia v. Madrazo, 1 Pet. 110, 7 L.Ed. 73 (1828), but the essential principle remained unaltered, as evidenced by Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203, 21 L.Ed. 447 (1873), a case decided two years after the Civil Rights Act of 1871:\n\"In deciding who are parties to the suit the court will not look beyond\nthe record.  Making a State officer a party does not make the State a party, although her law may have prompted his action, and the State may stand behind him as the real party in interest.  A State can be made a party only by shaping the bill expressly with that view, as where individuals or corporations are intended to be put in that relation to the case.\"  Id., at 220.\nFor the legislators of the 42d Congress, therefore, an action under \u00a7 1983 directed at state officers, regardless of the effect of the suit on the State itself, would preserve the Eleventh Amendment immunity of States, so long as States themselves were not named parties.  To the extent subsequent decisions of this Court have introduced an Eleventh Amendment bar to such suits when \"the action is in essence one for the recovery of money from the state,\" Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, 323 U.S. 459, 464, 65 S.Ct. 347, 350, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945), this bar would be eliminated by the congressional enactment of \u00a7 1983.  Since in the instant case neither the State of Illinois nor the office of the Governor of Illinois are parties \"on the record,\" even a limited reading of the reach of \u00a7 1983 should therefore hold the Eleventh Amendment inapplicable.\n\n\n17\n Section 1 of H.R. 320 was modeled after \u00a7 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, which imposed criminal penalties on \"any person\" who, \"under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom,\" deprived \"any inhabitant of any State or Territory\" of \"any right secured  . . .  by this act.\"  As Representative Shellabarger stated:  \"That section [\u00a7 2] provides a criminal proceeding in identically the same case as this one [\u00a7 1] provides a civil remedy  . . ..\"  Globe App. 68. Representative Bingham noted the limited application of the remedy provided by \u00a7 2:\n\"It is clear that if Congress do so provide by penal laws for the protection of these rights [guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment], those violating them must answer for the crime, and not the States.  The United States punishes men, not States, for a violation of its law.\"  Globe App. 85-86.\nRepresentative Bingham was thus able to distinguish, as apparently the Court is not, ante, at 341 n. 11, between the reach of the word \"person\" in \u00a7 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, and its reach in \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871.\n\n\n18\n Representative Blair reached this conclusion after reasoning that if the bill were interpreted as applicable only to individuals, it would not be able to fulfill the purposes of the Reconstruction Amendments.\n\n\n","label":1}

Delle Rose was serving a life sentence for the premeditated murder of his wife in 1963. At his trial, occurring before Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964), respondent was convicted by a jury which chose to credit has two confessions over his protestation of accidental involvement, and which presumably found them to be voluntary. On appeal, the New York appellate court directed the trial court to hold a special hearing to determine the voluntariness of his confessions in accordance with People v. Huntley, 15 N.Y.2d 72, 255 N.Y.S.2d 838, 204 N.E.2d 179 (1965), the State's procedural response to this Court's decision in Jackson v. Denno, supra.\n\n\n2\nOn remand to the trial court, the State rested on the trial record, and the respondent, in addition to relying on the record, testified in his own behalf. After extensively summarizing the trial evidence and respondent's explanations of certain of his confession statements, the court concluded:\n\n\n3\n'On all evidence, both at the trial and at the hearing, and      after considering the totality of the circumstances,      including the omission to warn defendant of his right to      counsel and his right against self-incrimination, I find and      decide that the respective confessions to the police and      district attorney were, in all respects, voluntary and      legally admissible in evidence at the trial. . . .'\n\n\n4\nOn this basis, respondent's conviction was affirmed by the New York appellate courts, 33 A.D.2d 657, 27 N.Y.2d 882, 317 N.Y.S.2d 358, 265 N.E.2d 770 (1970), and this Court denied certiorari, 402 U.S. 913, 91 S.Ct. 1395, 28 L.Ed.2d 656 (1971).\n\n\n5\nRespondent then petitioned the United States District Court for writ of habeas corpus alleging his confessions were involuntary. That court held that since the state trial judge had 'neglected to say how far he credited\u2014and to what extent, if any, he discounted or rejected' respondent's testimony and the evidence before him, there was no 'adequate' determination within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), which would have entitled the state court's findings to a presumption of correctness and placed on respondent the burden of establishing by convincing evidence that the state court's conclusion was erroneous. The District Court therefore held its own hearing, found both confessions involuntary, and ordered respondent discharged from custody unless retried, 342 F.Supp. 567. A divided panel of the Second Circuit affirmed, 468 F.2d 1288.\n\n\n6\nThe Court of Appeals held that the state court's opinion did not meet the requisites of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) which provides in relevant part:\n\n\n7\n'(A) determination after a hearing on the merits of a factual      issue, made by a State court of competent jurisdiction . . .      evidenced by a written finding, written opinion, or other      reliable and adequate written indicia, shall be presumed to      be correct, unless the applicant shall establish or it shall      otherwise appear, . . .\u2014\n\n\n8\n'(1) that the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved      in the State court hearing . . ..'\n\n\n9\nAlthough it is true that the state trial court did not specifically articulate its credibility findings, it can scarcely be doubted from its written opinion that respondent's factual contentions were resolved against him.\n\n\n10\nRespondent's wife was killed by a blast from a sawed-off shotgun device which had been set to shoot through the back of their front car seat. His confessions indicated that because of extreme jealousy, he rigged the device to go off when his wife pulled the car seat forward. For some reason it failed initially; so when he was seated with her in the car, he operated it by hand. At trial, he claimed his confessions were false and testified that he was seated in the car with his wife and he noticed a lump on the floor behind the front seat.\n\n\n11\nWhen he reached down to investigate, it shot her.\n\n\n12\nAt trial, in support of his theory of relentless questioning and police coercion, respondent presented evidence to the effect that, at the time of his confessions,\n\n\n13\n'he had had a back injury, and therefore was in pain; that he      was taken to the garage and asked to put his hand in the back      seat where the blood of his wife was; that the police      threatened to beat him up if he did not admit he killed her;      that he was compelled to say by the police that he had killed      his wife but that what he meant was that he had done so      inadvertently, by placing his hand over the lump; and that,      after telling the officer he wanted to see his wife, he did      not remember what happened thereafter until 9:00 o'clock in      the morning.'\n\n\n14\nIn addition, as his 'Huntley' hearing, he testified that the officers told him they would beat him up if he did not talk to them; that one of the detectives told him to put his hands in the front seat hole where his wife's blood was and when he did not, the detective took his hands and put them there himself; and that he did not remember anything past the time when he asked to see his wife at the morgue, including the giving of the second statement. He also attempted to explain the reasons for his giving such detailed and factually accurate confession statements.\n\n\n15\nThe trial court's summary of the State's evidence tended to show that although respondent had been taken to the station house about 5 p.m. on the day of the murder, he was not even a suspect as late as 9 p.m., and he was only giving information. He was taken to the morgue at his own request, a factor which triggered the first confession. Further, he had been allowed to sit with his family, was given coffee by his mother-in-law and police, and he admitted that his treatment by the police was good during the time of the questioning. There was also testimony that he had been offered food, but as he admitted, he was not hungry. Again at the 'Huntley' hearing, he acknowledged that the police had treated him 'nice.' It was 'on this evidence' that the state trial court made its finding and conclusion that the confessions were voluntary.\n\n\n16\nThe Court of Appeals stated that it could not tell whether the state courts 'credited Delle Rose's story of the circumstances surrounding his confessions but still held these to have been voluntary, a conclusion to which we could not agree or based their holding of voluntariness on a partial or complete rejection of his testimony, in which event the district judge would have been bound to deny the petition.' 468 F.2d 1288, 1290. In Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 314\u2014315, 315, 83 S.Ct. 745, 757\u2014758, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), the precursor of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), this Court set forth general standards governing the holding of hearings on federal habeas petitions, stating:\n\n\n17\n'(T)he possibility of legal error may be eliminated in many      situations if the fact finder has articulated the      constitutional standards which he has applied. Furthermore,      the coequal responsibilities of state and federal judges in      the administration of federal constitutional law are such      that he think the district judge may, in the ordinary case in      which there has been no articulation, properly assume that      the state trier of fact applied correct standards of federal      law to the facts, in the absence of evidence . . . that there      is reason to suspect that an incorrect standard was in fact      applied. Thus, if third-degree methods of obtaining a      confession are alleged and the state court refused to exclude      the confession from evidence, the district judge may assume      that the state trier found the facts against the petitioner,      the law being, of course, that theird-degree methods      necessarily produce a coerced confession.' Here, not only is there no evidence that the state trier utilized the wrong standard, but there is every indication he applied the correct standards. His determination was made on the 'totality of the circumstances' and, in this pre-Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964), pre-Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), situation, the court also considered the facts that respondent was not warned of his rights to the assistance of counsel and against self-incrimination before confessing. And we quite agree with the District Court's statement that it could not go along with the state trial court's conclusion of voluntariness if it 'were to find the facts to have been as petitioner's (Delle Rose's) testimony portrayed them.' See, e.g., Spano v. New York, 360 U.S. 315, 79 S.Ct. 1202, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265 (1959); Watts v. Indiana, 338 U.S. 49, 69 S.Ct. 1347, 93 L.Ed. 1801 (1949). Under these circumstances, we think the District Court could have been reasonably certain that the state court would have granted relief if it had believed respondent's allegations. See Townsend v. Sain, supara, 372 U.S., at 315, 83 S.Ct., at 758.\n\n\n18\nWe, therefore, hold that the opinion of the state trial court met the requirements of 28 U.S.C \u00a7 2254 (d)(1), and that the courts below incorrectly determined it did not. The burden was thus on respondent to establish in the District Court by convincing evidence that the state court's determination was erroneous. The motion of the respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for certiorari are granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n19\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n20\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, Mr. Justice BRENNAN, and Mr. Justice STEWART concur, dissenting.\n\n\n21\nAlthough I am in complete disagreement with this Court's per curiam decision herein, I see no reason to set this case for oral argument in light of the majority's firmly held views.\n\n\n22\nI cannot accept the Court's holding that both the District Court and the Court of Appeals improperly concluded that the voluntariness of respondent's confessions was not adequately resolved by the state trial court, thereby relieving respondent of the obligation to establish 'by convincing evidence that the factual determination by the State court was erroneous,' 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The Court does not deny that the state trial court judge, after summarizing the record evidence and respondent's testimony on the question of voluntariness, utterly failed to explain the basis for his conclusion that 'considering the totality of circumstances . . . the respective confessions to the police and district attorney were, in all respects, voluntary and legally admissible in evidence at the trial . . ..' Despite this absence of any reasoned explanation for the state court's action, the Court now assures us that 'it can scarcely be doubted from its written opinion that respondent's factual contentions were resolved against him.' Ante, at 692. I could not disagree more, and therefore I must respectfully dissent.\n\n\n23\nForemost, the Court's certainty as to the basis for the state court's action rests upon the fact that it is clear the state court 'applied' the correct legal standard in evaluating the voluntariness of respondent's confession. Without question, the state court in this case ritualistically recited the standard of 'totality of the circumstances' which governs the determination of voluntariness with respect to these 1963 confessions. See, e.g., Clewis v. Texas, 386 U.S. 707, 708, 87 S.Ct. 1338, 1339, 18 L.Ed.2d 423 (1967). But this recitation in itself provided the courts below with no guarantee that the state court had not erroneously applied this standard to the facts of this case, perhaps accepting respondent's version of the circumstances surrounding the confession, rather than rejecting respondent's version as incredible. Thus, the able District Judge noted that '(t)his court cannot be 'reasonably certain' what facts of possibly coercive or stressful impact the trial judge found from the disputed testimony' introduced before him. 342 F.Supp. 567, 570.\n\n\n24\nThe Court, however, places heavy reliance upon our prior statement in Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 314\u2014315, 83 S.Ct. 745, 758, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), the source of the test set forth in \u00a7 2254(d)(1), that 'the district judge may, in the ordinary case in which there has been no articulation, properly assume that the state trier of fact applied correct standards of federal law to the facts, in the absence of evidence . . . that there is reason to suspect that an incorrect standard was in fact applied. Thus, if third-degree methods of obtaining a confession are alleged and the state court refused to exclude the confession from evidence, the district judge may assume that the state trier found the facts against the petitioner, the law being, of course, that third-degree methods necessarily produce a coerced confession.'1 But this is hardly the limit of the inquiry\u2014contemplated by Townsend and \u00a7 2254(d)\u2014 into whether a state court has adequately resolved the factual issues presented by the constitutional claim.\n\n\n25\n'(E)ven if it is clear that the state trier of fact utilized      the proper standard, a hearing is sometimes required if his      decision presents a situation in which the 'so-called facts      and their constitutional significance (are) . . . so blended      that they cannot be severed in consideration.' . . . Unless      the district judge can be reasonably certain that the state      trier would have granted relief if he had believed      petitioner's allegations, he cannot be sure that the state      trier in denying relief disbelieved these allegations. If any      combination of the facts alleged would prove a violation of      constitutional rights and the issue of law on those facts      presents a difficult or novel problem for decision, any      hypothesis as to the relevant factual determinations of the      state trier involves the purest speculation. The federal      court cannot exclude the possibility that the trial judge      believed facts which showed a deprivation of constitutional      rights and yet (erroneously) concluded that relief should be      denied. Under these circumstances it is impossible for the      federal court to reconstruct the facts, and a hearing must be      held.' Townsend v. Sain, supra, at 315\u2014316, 83 S.Ct., at 758      (emphasis added).\n\n\n26\nThe precise problem encountered by the courts below in evaluating the state court's conclusion\u2014a problem which the Court now effectively ignores\u2014is that the issue of voluntariness in this case presents just the sort of 'difficult' mixed question of law and fact which Townsend recognized would make federal court speculation concerning the basis for unreasoned state court action wholly inappropriate. To be sure, where, for instance, a defendant alleges simply that a confession was extracted from him by means of a physical beating administered by the police, it is obvious that if the defendant's story is believed, the confession would be involuntary. Thus, even if a state court holds the defendant's confession to be voluntary without articulating any reasons, a federal district court may safely assume that in such an uncomplicated situation the state court's determination resulted from a rejection of the defendant's factual allegations. But it can hardly be argued that this case involves allegations of the type of straightforward police 'third-degree methods of obtaining a confession' which the Townsend Court suggested would entail little possibility of misapplication of the relevant legal standard so that a district court might, with reasonable confidence, assume that an unexplained state court finding of voluntariness rests upon a rejection of the defendant's version of the interrogation, not upon constitutional error. For a review of the state court's opinion following the 'Huntley' hearing reveals that here the state court was confronted, not with an allegation of a single coercive incident which, if believed, would clearly have resulted in a finding of involuntariness, but rather with allegations of a series of coercive police actions applied to a particularly susceptible suspect.\n\n\n27\nRespondent claimed that he was held and interrogated, apparently without rest, from 5 p.m. on the day of the murder until sometime early the next morning. Throughout this time, respondent purportedly was suffering pain due to a serious back ailment and was undoubtedly handicapped by his lack of facility with the English language. Meanwhile, without any warnings as to his constitutional rights, he was questioned repeatedly by police officers, questioning which allegedly included physical threats if he refused to confess. During this process, respondent was compelled by the police to reenact the alleged murder of his wife complete with his hand being forced by a police officer into the torn seat back which was wet with his wife's blood. Then the police offered to take respondent on what the District Court properly described as a 'macabre' visit to the morgue to see his dead wife's body. There the police obtained the first confession. Subsequently, further questioning by an assistant district attorney produced a second confession at about 6 a.m. A defense psychiatrist testified at trial that respondent was, in his opinion, so exhausted from his long ordeal at the hands of the police that 'he would say yes if you asked him if the moon were made of green cheese.'\n\n\n28\nIt is possible, of course, that the state court rejected all of respondent's testimony as incredible and therefore properly held the confessions voluntary. On the other hand, if the state court had believed all of respondent's contentions, it would undoubtedly have found the confessions involuntary. There remains, however, the third possibility that the state court believed some of respondent's contentions and rejected others. It is this last possibility that makes for substantial uncertainty in a factually complex case such as this as to whether the the state court correctly applied the abstract legal standard and did not, instead, commit constitutional error. Due to the unrevealing nature of the state court's decision, it is impossible to say that that court may not have credited a sufficient portion of respondent's story to establish, under the controlling standard, the involuntariness of his confessions and nevertheless have reached an erroneous conclusion of voluntariness because the question may have been a close one on the facts that it accepted. It is this inherent uncertainty as to what the state court may have believed or disbelieved that justified the action of the District Court and the Court of Appeals in this case. To conclude otherwise, I believe, ignores the full import of this Court's reasoning in Townsend v. Sain, supra, concerning those limited situations in which a federal district court on habeas corpus may reasonably assume that an unexplained state court determination rests merely upon a rejection of testimony rather than upon constitutional error.\n\n\n29\nConsequently, in my view, the courts below properly held the State not entitled in this case to the presumption of correctness and the special burden of proof set forth in \u00a7 2254(d).2 As for the merits, I see no basis for this Court to set aside the District Court's finding of involuntariness, a finding sustained by the Court of Appeals as not 'clearly erroneous' under Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 52(a). Cf. Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 201, 93 S.Ct. 375, 383, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972) (opinion of Brennan, J.).\n\n\n\n*\n Respondent was ordered released unless retried within 60 days without the use of his confessions.\n\n\n1\n Insofar as the Court relies upon this language fromTownsend in interpreting \u00a7 2254(d)(1), the Court effectively ignores the discretionary character of the decision lodged with the district judge who is faced with a question as to the adequacy of unexplained state court findings. Townsend indicates that 'the district judge may, in the ordinary case in which there has been no articulation, properly assume' that the state court reached a constitutionally permissible conclusion. (Emphasis added.) Today, however, the Court effectively indicates that the district court often must assume in such cases that the proper standard was applied. Such a rigid standard seems to me wholly improper and unworkable where the question whether the defendant's testimony was simply rejected and the proper standard applied is essentially one of judgment dependent upon the facts of each particular case. These matters are properly left largely to the discretion of the district judge. And here, certainly, it cannot be said such discretion was abused.\n\n\n2\n The Court, of course, does not hold that the District Court erred in holding a de novo evidentiary hearing on the voluntariness of respondent's confession. That is a question distinct from the presumption of validity and the special burden of proof established by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Section 2254(d) says nothing concerning when a district judge may hold an evidentiary hearing\u2014as opposed to acting simply on the state court record\u2014in considering a state prisoner's petition for federal habeas corpus. So far as I understand, the question whether such a hearing is appropriate on federal habeas corpus continues to be controlled exclusively by our decision in Townsend v. Sain even after the enactment of \u00a7 2254(d). See Developments in the Law\u2014Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1141 (1970). And, Townsend explicitly recognizes that, apart from the six specific instances described in that opinion as mandating an evidentiary hearing '(i)n all other cases where the material facts are in dispute, the holding of . . . a hearing is in the discretion of the district judge. . . . In every case he has the power, constrained only by his sound discretion, to receive evidence bearing upon the applicant's constitutional claim.' 372 U.S., at 318, 83 S.Ct., at 760.\n\n\n","label":0}

Cooper, for respondent.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner, a native and national of Canada, filed a petition for naturalization under the provisions of \u00a7 310(b) of the Nationality Act of 1940, 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) \u00a7 710(b), now 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1430. On April 18, 1962, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a final order denying the petition on the ground that petitioner had failed to establish his attachment to the United States Constitution. Twelve days later, on April 30, 1962, petitioner served notice on the Immigration and Naturalization Service that he would appear before the trial judge on May 2, 1962, with post-trial motions 'to amend certain findings of fact pursuant to Rule 52 F.R.C.P. and for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59 F.R.C.P.' The Government raised no objection as to the timeliness of these motions, and the trial court specifically declared that the 'motion for a new trial' was made 'in ample time.' On October 16, 1962, these motions were denied. On December 6, 1962, within 60 days of the denial of the post-trial motions but not within 60 days of the original entry of judgment by the District Court, petitioner filed a notice of appeal. The Government then moved in the Court of Appeals to dismiss the appeal on the ground that notice of appeal had not been filed within the 60-day period prescribed by Rule 73(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and that petitioner's post-trial motions were untimely and hence did not toll the running of the time for appeal. The Court of Appeals granted the motions. Petitioner now seeks review by certiorari of the dismissal of his appeal.\n\n\n2\nRule 73(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure designates 'the time within which an appeal may be taken' in this type of case as '60 days' from 'the entry of the judgment appealed from * * *.' The Rule also declares that:\n\n\n3\n'the full time for appeal fixed in this subdivision commences      to run and is to be computed from the entry of any of the      following orders made upon a timely motion under such rules:      * * * granting or denying a motion under Rule 52(b) to amend      or make additional findings of fact * * *; or granting or      denying a motion under Rule 59 to alter or amend the      judgment; or denying a motion for a new trial under Rule 59.'      (Emphasis added.) It is clear that if petitioner's post-trial motions were 'timely,' then the appeal, which was filed within 60 days of the disposition of the motions, was timely. The Government alleges, however, that the post-trial motions were not timely since the applicable rules provide that they must be 'served not later than 10 days after the entry of the judgment,' and these motions were served 12 days after the entry of judgment. The Government concludes, therefore, that since there was no 'timely motion' under the rules designated in Rule 73(a), the appeal must be, but was not, filed within 60 days of the entry of the original judgment.\n\n\n4\nAlthough petitioner admits that the post-trial motions were not served until 12 days after the entry of judgment, he claims that they should be deemed timely since they were served 10 days 'from receipt of notice of entry of the judgment' by his lawyers who were not in court on the day the judgment was entered. He claims, moreover, that he relied on the Government's failure to raise a claim of untimeliness when the motions were filed and on the District Court's explicit statement that the motion for a new trial was made 'in ample time'; for if any question had been raised about the timeliness of the motions at that juncture, petitioner could have, and presumably would have, filed the appeal within 60 days of the entry of the original judgment, rather than waiting, as he did, until after the trial court had disposed of the post-trial motions.\n\n\n5\nIn a recent case involving a closely related issue, we recognized 'the obvious great hardship to a party who relies upon the trial judge's finding of 'excusable neglect' prior to the expiration of the (applicable period for filing an appeal) and then suffers reversal of the finding * * *' after the time for filing the appeal has expired. Harris Truck Lines, Inc., v. Cherry Meat Packers, Inc., 371 U.S. 215, 217, 83 S.Ct. 283, 285, 9 L.Ed.2d 261. In that case petitioner had, within the applicable period for filing his appeal, received from the trial court a 30-day extension on the time for filing his appeal on the ground of 'excusable neglect based on a failure of a party to learn of the entry of the judgment.' Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 73(a). Petitioner then filed his appeal within the period of the extension but beyond the original period. The Court of Appeals, concluding that there had been no 'excusable neglect' within the meaning of Rule 73(a), held that the District Court had erred in granting the extension and dismissed the appeal. We reversed the dismissal and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals 'so that petitioner's appeal may be heard on its merits.'\n\n\n6\nIbid. See also Lieberman v. Gulf Oil Corp., 2 Cir., 315 F.2d 403, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 823, 84 S.Ct. 62, 11 L.Ed.2d 56.\n\n\n7\nThe instant cause fits squarely within the letter and spirit of Harris. Here, as there, petitioner did an act which, if properly done, postponed the deadline for the filing of his appeal. Here, as there, the District Court concluded that the act had been properly done. Here, as there, the petitioner relied on the statement of the District Court and filed the appeal within the assumedly new deadline but beyond the old deadline. And here, as there, the Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court had erred and dismissed the appeal. Accordingly, in view of these 'unique circumstances,' Harris Truck Lines, Inc., v. Cherry Meat Packers, Inc., supra, 371 U.S. at 217, 83 S.Ct. at 285, 9 L.Ed.2d 261, we grant the writ of certiorari, vacate the judgment, and remand the case to the Court of Appeals so that petitioner's appeal may be heard on the merits. It is so ordered.\n\n\n8\nJudgment vacated and case remanded to the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n9\nMr. Justice CLARK, with whom Mr. Justice HARLAN, Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice WHITE join, dissenting.\n\n\n10\nI agree with the Court of Appeals that it did not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal on the merits.\n\n\n11\nPetitioner's motions 'to amend certain findings of fact pursuant to Rule 52 F.R.C.P. and for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59 F.R.C.P.' were not timely filed, as they were not served until the 12th day after entry of judgment and not filed until the 14th day. The rules are phrased in mandatory terms:\n\n\n12\n'Rule 52(b): 'Upon motion of a party made not later than 10      days after entry of judgment the court may amend its findings      * * *.'\n\n\n13\n'Rule 59(b): 'A motion for a new trial shall be served not      later than 10 days after the entry of the judgment.'\n\n\n14\nRule 59(e): 'A motion to alter or amend the judgment shall be      served not later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.'      (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n15\nRule 6(b) specifically says that the court 'may not extend the time for taking any action under rules * * * 52(b), 59(b), (d) and (e) * * * and 73(a) * * * except to the extent and under the conditions stated in them.' These requirements are mandatory and cannot be enlarged by the court or by the parties. None of these rules provides for any extension of time except 73(a), which authorizes, 'upon a showing of excusable neglect based on a failure of a party to learn of the entry of the judgment,' an extension of the time for appeal 'not exceeding 30 days from the expiration of the original time herein prescribed.' Petitioner has made no claim under this provision of Rule 73(a) in the District Court, the Court of Appeals or in the 'questions presented' here. The running of the time for appeal is terminated by the filing of a timely motion under Rule 52 or Rule 59. But here petitioner contends that the trial court's statement that the motions were 'in ample time,' considered together with the Government's acquiescence, was sufficient to effect such termination. Whether the trial judge's statement was spontaneous or made by agreement is not shown by the record and is of no legal significance. The rules specifically say that motions to amend the findings and for new trial must be made within 10 days and that this time shall not be extended.\n\n\n16\nIn the light of these facts I cannot say that this case 'fits squarely within the letter and spirit' of Harris Truck Lines, Inc. v. Cherry Meat Packers, Inc., 371 U.S. 215, 83 S.Ct. 283, 9 L.Ed.2d 261 (1962). As I read the facts in the two cases, Harris Lines does not touch the problem here. In that case the District Court, after denying a timely motion for a new trial, granted an application under Rule 73(a) based on 'excusable neglect' to enlarge the time for appeal. The trial court had jurisdiction and 'properly entertained the motion * * * before the initial 30 days allowed for docketing the appeal had elapsed.' 371 U.S. at 216, 83 S.Ct. at 285, 9 L.Ed.2d 261. We said that a finding of 'excusable neglect' by a motions judge was entitled to 'great deference by the reviewing court' in the light of the 'obvious great hardship to a party who relies upon the trial judge's finding.' 371 U.S. at 217, 83 S.Ct. at 285, 9 L.Ed.2d 261. Finally, we said that the showing of 'excusable neglect' was of 'unique circumstances sufficient that the Court of  ppeals ought not to have disturbed the motion judge's ruling.' Ibid. That is a far cry from this case where the trial court had no jurisdiction to pass upon the untimely motions to amend the findings and for a new trial. To escape this, the Court either reads into the rules, contrary to the specific prohibition of 6(b), authorization for the District Court to enlarge the time for filing such motions, or treats the motions as being within the provisions of Rule 73(a), despite failure to allege any 'excusable neglect.' By thus authorizing the trial judge to entertain the motions it thereby extends the time for appeal. And, as I have said, the error of the trial judge in entertaining the motions could not be validated by the acquiescence of the Government. It is elementary that the parties cannot confer jurisdiction on the court.\n\n\n17\nWe have said that untimely motions to amend the findings and for new trial are of no legal significance whatsoever because the limiting language of Rule 6(b) is 'mandatory and jurisdictional and (can)not be extended regardless of excuse.' United States v. Robinson, 361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 288, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960). In my view we should abide by these rules or amend them, rather than emasculate them.\n\n\n18\nRules of procedure are a necessary part of an orderly system of justice. Their efficacy, however, depends upon the willingness of the courts to enforce them according to their terms. Changes in rules whose inflexibility has turned out to work hardship should be effected by the process of amendment, not by ad hoc relaxations by this Court in particular cases. Such dispensations in the long run actually produce mischievous results, undermining the certainty of the rules and causing confusion among the lower courts and the bar. Cf. Lieberman v. Gulf Oil Corp., 2 Cir., 315 F.2d 403, 406, 407.\n\n\n19\nAccordingly, I would have denied certiorari in the present case, but now that it is here I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"413 U.S. 345\n93 S.Ct. 2591\n37 L.Ed.2d 648\nNATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR the ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED  PEOPLE, etc., et al., Appellants,v.State of NEW YORK et al.\nNo. 72\u2014129.\nArgued Feb. 27\u201428, 1973.\nDecided June 21, 1973.\n\nSyllabus\nSections 4 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, are designed to prohibit the use of tests or devices, or the alteration of voting qualifications or procedures, when the purpose or effect is to deprive a citizen of his right to vote. Sections 4 and 5 apply in any State or political subdivision thereof which the Attorney General determines maintained on November 1, 1964, or November 1, 1968, any 'test or device,' and with respect to which the Director of the Census Bureau determines that less than half the voting-age residents were registered, or that less than half voted in the presidential election of that November. These determinations are effective on publication and are not judicially reviewable. Publication suspends the effectiveness of the test or device, which may not then be utilized unless a three-judge District Court for the District of Columbia determines that no such test or device has been used during the 10 preceding years 'for the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.' The section provides for direct appeal to the Supreme Court. The State or political subdivision may also institute an action pursuant to \u00a7 5 in the District Court for the District of Columbia, for a declaratory judgment that a proposed alteration in voting qualifications or procedures 'does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.' The statute also permits the change to be enforced without the court proceeding if it has been submitted to the Attorney General and he has not interposed an objection within 60 days. Neither the Attorney General's failure to object nor a \u00a7 5 declaratory judgment bars a subsequent private action to enjoin enforcement of the change. Such an action shall also be determined by a three-judge court and is appealable to the Supreme Court. The Attorney General, on July 31, 1970, filed with the Federal Register his determination that New York on November 1, 1968, maintained a test or device as defined in the Act, and this was published the next day. On March 27, 1971, the Federal Register published the Census Director's determination that in the counties of Bronx, Kings, and New York, 'less than 50 per centum of the persons of voting age residing therein voted in the presidential election of November 1968.' New York State filed an action on December 3, 1971, seeking a judgment declaring that during the preceding 10 years the three counties had not used the State's voting qualifications 'for the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color' and that \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 were thus inapplicable to the counties. Pursuant to stipulation, the United States filed its answer on March 10, 1972, alleging, inter alia, that it was without knowledge or information to form a belief as to the truth of New York's allegation that the literacy tests were not administered discriminatorily. On March 17, New York filed a motion for summary judgment, supported by affidavits, and on April 3 the United States formally consented to the entry of the declaratory judgment sought by the State. Appellants filed their motion to intervene on April 7. New York opposed the motion claiming that: it was untimely, as the suit had been pending for more than four months; it had been publicized in early February, and appellants did not deny that they knew the action was pending; appellants failed to allege appropriate supporting facts; no appellant claimed to be a victim of voting discrimination; appellants' interests were adequately represented by the United States; delay would prejudice impending elections; and appellants still could raise discrimination issues in the state and federal courts of New York. On April 13 the three-judge court denied the motion to intervene and granted summary judgment for New York. While the appeal was pending, it was disclosed that the attorney who executed affidavits for appellants had not begun employment with appellant NAACP Legal Defense & Education Fund, Inc., until March 9, 1972, and that Justice Department attorneys met with two individual appellants in January 1972 during the course of their investigation. Held:\n\n\n1\n1. The words 'any appeal' in \u00a7 4(a) encompass an appeal by a would-be, but unsuccessful, intervenor, and appellants' appeal properly lies to this Court. Pp. 353\u2014356.\n\n\n2\n2. The motion to invervene was untimely, and in the light of that fact and all the other circumstances of this case, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. Pp. 364 369.\n\n\n3\nAffirmed.\n\n\n4\nJack Greenberg, New York City, for appellants.\n\n\n5\nA. Raymond Randolph, Jr., Washington, D.C., for appellee United States.\n\n\n6\nGeorge D. Zuckerman, New York City, for appellee New York.\n\n\n7\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n8\nThis appeal from a three-judge district court for the District of Columbia comes to us pursuant to the direct-review provisions of \u00a7 4(a) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Pub.L. 89 110, 79 Stat. 438, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973b(a).1 The appellants2 seek review of an order dated April 13, 1972, unaccompanied by any opinion, denying their motion to intervene3 in a suit that had been instituted against the United States by the State of New York, on behalf of its counties of New York, Bronx, and Kings. New York's action was one for a judgment declaring that, during the 10 years preceding the filing of the suit, voter qualifications prescribed by the State had not been used by the three named counties 'for the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color,' within the language and meaning of \u00a7 4(a), and that the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 of the Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1973b and 1973c, are, therefore, inapplicable to the three counties.\n\n\n9\nIn addition to denying the appellants' motion to intervene, the District Court, by the same order, granted New York's motion for summary judgment. This was based upon a formal consent by the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division, on behalf of the United States, consistent with the Government's answer theretofore filed, 'to the entry of a declaratory judgment under Section 4(a) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 1973b(a)),' App. 39a. The consent was supported by an accompanying affidavit reciting, 'I conclude, on behalf of the Acting Attorney General that there is no reason to believe that a literacy test has been used in the past 10 years in the counties of New York, Kings and Bronx with the purpose or effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color, except for isolated instances which have been substantially corrected and which, under present practice cannot reoccur.' App. 42a\u201443a.\n\n\n10\nAppellants contend here that their motion to intervene should have been granted because (1) the United States unjustifiably declined to oppose New York's motion for summary judgment; (2) the appellants had initiated other litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to compel compliance with \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 of the Act; and (3) the appellants possessed 'substantial documentary evidence,' Jurisdictional Statement 7, to offer in opposition to the entry of the declaratory judgment.\n\n\n11\nFaced with the initial question whether this Court has jurisdiction, on direct appeal, to review the denial of the appellants' motion to intervene, we postponed determination of that issue to the hearing of the case on the merits. 409 U.S. 978, 93 S.Ct. 310, 34 L.Ed.2d 240.\n\n\n12\n* Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973,4 clearly indicates that the purpose of the Act is to assist in the effectuation of the Fifteenth Amendment, even though that Amendment is self-executing, and to insure that no citizen's right to vote is denied or abridged on account of race or color. South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 86 S.Ct. 803, 15 L.Ed.2d 769 (1966); Apache County v. United States, 256 F.Supp. 903 (DC 1966). Sections 4 and 5, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1973b and 1973c, are designed to prohibit the use of tests or devices, or the alteration of voting qualifications or procedures, when the effect is to deprive a citizen of his right to vote. Section 4(c) defines the phrase 'test or device' to mean\n\n\n13\n'any requirement that a person as a prerequisite for voting      or registration for voting (1) demonstrate the ability to      read, write, understand, or interpret any matter, (2)      demonstrate any educational achievement or his knowledge of any particular subject, (3)      possess good moral character, or (4) prove his qualifications      by the voucher of registered voters or members of any other      class.' 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973b(c).\n\n\n14\nSection 4(b), as amended, now applies in any State or in any political subdivision of a State which the Attorney General determines maintained on November 1, 1964, or November 1, 1968, any 'test or device,' and with respect to which the Director of the Bureau of the Census determines that less than half the residents of voting age there were registered on the specified date, or that less than half of such persons voted in the presidential election of that November. These determinations are effective upon publication in the Federal Register and are not reviewable in any court. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973b(b).\n\n\n15\nThe prescribed publication in the Federal Register suspends the effectiveness of the test or device, and it may not then be utilized unless a three-judge district court for the District of Columbia determines, by declaratory judgment, that no such test or device has been used during the 10 years preceding the filing of the action 'for the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.' \u00a7 4(a), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973b(a). The same section states that 'any appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court.' And the District Court 'shall retain jurisdiction of any action pursuant to this subsection for five years after judgment and shall reopen the action upon motion of the Attorney General alleging that a test or device has been used for the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.'\n\n\n16\nSection 5, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c, applies whenever a State or political subdivision with respect to which a determination has been made under \u00a7 4(b) 'shall enact or seek to administer any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting different from that in force or effect' on November 1, 1964, or November 1, 1968.5 The State or political subdivision may then institute an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for a declaratory judgment that what was done 'does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.' Unless and until the court enters such judgment 'no person shall be denied the right to vote for failure to comply with such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure.' The statute contains a proviso, however, that the change may be enforced without the court proceeding if it has been submitted to the Attorney General of the United States and he 'has not interposed an objection within sixty days after such submission.' Neither the Attorney General's failure to object nor a declaratory judgment entered under \u00a7 5 shall bar a subsequent action by a private party to enjoin enforcement of the change. Here again, the action shall be determined by a three-judge court 'and any appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court.'\n\nII\n\n17\nOn July 31, 1970, the Attorney General filed with the Federal Register his determination that New York on November 1, 1968, maintained a test or device as defined in \u00a7 4(c) of the Act. This was published the following day. 35 Fed.Reg. 12354. On March 27, 1971, there was published in the Federal Register the determination by the Director of the Bureau of the Census that in the counties of Bronx, Kings, and New York, in the State of New York, 'less than 50 per centum of the persons of voting age residing therein voted in the presidential election of November 1968.' 36 Fed.Reg. 5809.\n\n\n18\nThe present action was instituted by the State of New York with the filing of its original complaint on December 3, 1971, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The appellants contend that the District Court's order denying them intervention in that action is directly appealable to this Court under \u00a7 4(a) of the Act.\n\n\n19\nThe United States 'substantially' agrees that this Court has jurisdiction to review on direct appeal the denial of intervention in an action of this kind.6 Brief for United States 21 n. 15. New York suggests that the appeal should be dismissed because the appellants have not established intervention as of right and have not demonstrated an abuse of discretion by the District Court in denying permissive intervention. Brief for Appellee 22\u201423. We must determine for ourselves, of course, the scope of our jurisdiction, since 'jurisdiction of the federal courts\u2014their power to adjudicate\u2014is a grant of authority to them by Congress and thus beyond the scope of litigants to confer.' Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem Corp., 308 U.S. 165, 167, 60 S.Ct. 153, 154, 84 L.Ed. 167 (1939); Mitchell v. Maurer, 293 U.S. 237, 244, 55 S.Ct. 162, 165, 79 L.Ed. 338 (1934).\n\n\n20\nThe jurisdictional issue is simply phrased: whether 'any appeal,' within the language of the second paragraph of \u00a7 4(a), includes an appeal by a would-be, but unsuccessful, intervenor. Certainly, the words 'any appeal' are subject to broad construction; they could be said to include review of any meaningful judicial determination made in the progress of the \u00a7 4 lawsuit. That Congress intended a broad meaning is apparent from its expressed concern that voting restraints on account of race or color should be removed as quickly as possible in order to 'open the door to the exercise of constitutional rights conferred almost a century ago.' H.R.Rep.No.439, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 11 (1965). See S.Rep.No.162, pt. 3, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 6\u20147 (1965) U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, p. 2437. Indeed, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was an addition to, and buttressed, \u00a7 2004 of the Revised Statutes, as that section had been amended by the respective Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1964, 71 Stat. 637, 74 Stat. 90, and 78 Stat. 241, codified as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1971. When the 1965 Act was under consideration by the Congress, \u00a7 1971(c) already empowered the Attorney General to institute a civil action to protect the right to vote from deprivation because of race or color or from interference by threat, coercion, or intimidation. Section 1971(g) further provided that, in such a suit, the Attorney General could request a three-judge court, and 'it shall be the duty of the judges so designated to assign the case for hearing at the earliest practicable date . . . and to cause the case to be in every way expedited.' Further, an appeal from the final judgment of that court was to the Supreme Court.\n\n\n21\nDespite this existing statutory provision designed to hasten the removal of barriers to the right to vote, the Congress determined, in 1965, that the enforcement of the voting rights statutes 'has encountered serious obstacles in various regions of the country,' and progress 'has been painfully slow, in part because of the intransigence of State and local officials and repeated delays in the judicial process.' H.R.Rep.No.439, supra, at 9. See South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S., at 309\u2014315, 86 S.Ct., at 808\u2014811, and Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 556 n. 21, 89 S.Ct. 817, 826, 22 L.Ed.2d 1 (1969). Congress thus produced the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in response to this recognized problem and provided in that Act that 'any appeal' in a \u00a7 4(a) three-judge proceeding shall lie to this Court. This contrasts with the language in the earlier theretofore existing statute providing for an appeal here only 'from the final judgement' of the three-judge court. \u00a7 1971(g). The broader language of \u00a7 4(a), when viewed in the light of Congress' concern about hastening the resolution of suits involving voting rights, see Apache County v. United States, 256 F.Supp., at 907, prompts us to conclude that the unsuccessful intervenor's \u00a7 4(a) appeal is directly here and not to the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n22\nThis conclusion is not without other relevant statutory precedent. It has long been settled that an unsuccessful intervenor in a government-initiated civil antitrust action may appeal directly to this Court under \u00a7 2 of the Expediting Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 29.7 United States v. California Co-op Canneries, 279 U.S. 553, 559, 49 S.Ct. 423, 425, 73 L.Ed. 838 (1929); Sutphen Estates v. United States, 342 U.S. 19, 20, 72 S.Ct. 14, 15  96 L.Ed. 19 (1951); Cascade Natural Gas Corp. v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 386 U.S. 129, 132, 87 S.Ct. 932, 935, 17 L.Ed.2d 814 (1967).\n\n\n23\nEarlier this Term, in Tidewater Oil Co. v. United States, 409 U.S. 151, 93 S.Ct. 408, 34 L.Ed.2d 375 (1972), we held that \u00a7 2 of the Expediting Act lodged in this Court exclusive appellate jurisdiction over interlocutory, as well as final orders in Government civil antitrust cases. In so holding, we emphasized Congress' determination 'to speed appellate review.' Id., at 155, 93 S.Ct. at 411. As we have noted above, Congress has expressed a similar need for speed in adjudicating voting rights cases. We could not justify dissimilar treatment to an unsuccessful intervenor under the parallel \u00a7 4(a) of the Civil Rights Act.\n\n\n24\nFurther support for this result is supplied when one contrasts the specific appeal provision of \u00a7 4(a) with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253,8 allowing for a direct appeal to this Court from an order granting or denying an interlocutory or permanent injunction 'in any civil action, suit or proceeding required by any Act of Congress to be heard and determined by a district court of three judges.' That section provides that 'any party' may appeal here except 'as otherwise provided by law.' Section 4(a) does not incorporate or refer to \u00a7 1253. The former relates to 'any appeal'; the latter speaks only of 'any party.' The difference is obvious, and the broader purport of Congress under \u00a7 4(a) is manifest.\n\n\n25\nWe conclude, therefore, that this Court has jurisdiction, on direct appeal by one denied intervention in a \u00a7 4(a) action, to determine whether the District Court erred in denying the motion to intervene.\n\nIII\n\n26\nAs originally enacted, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 related only to a period of five preceding years, to a test or device in effect on November 1, 1964, to a paucity of persons registered on that date, and to a paucity of voters in the presidential election of 1964. 79 Stat. 438, 439. In 1970, however, Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970. Pub.L. 91\u2014285, 84 Stat. 314. This new legislation, among other things, related \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 to ten, rather than five, proceding years and, in addition to the November 1, 1964, date and the presidential election of that year, to November 1, 1968, and the 1968 election. Also, the 1970 Act suspended the use of any test or device 'in any Federal, State, or local election' prior to August 6, 1975, without regard to whether a determination has been made that \u00a7 4 covered a particular State or political subdivision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973aa. See Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 131\u2014132, 91 S.Ct. 260, 268, 27 L.Ed.2d 272 (1970) (opinion of Black, J.).\n\n\n27\nThe three New York counties that the present litigation concerns were not covered by \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5 of the original 1965 Act. They became subject thereto because of the provisions of the 1970 Act and the respective published determinations, hereinabove described, of the Attorney General and the Director of the Bureau of the Census. Indeed, it is clear that the three counties were a definite target of the 1970 amendments. See, e.g., 116 Cong.Rec. 6659 (1970) (remarks of Sen. Cooper); id., at 20161 and 20165 (remarks of Congs. Celler and Albert, respectively).\n\n\n28\nIt was in December 1971, during the pendency of state legislative proceedings for the redrafting of congressional and state senate and assembly district lines,9 that the State of New York filed its complaint in the present action.10 The amended complaint, filed 13 days later, alleged that certain of the State's qualifications for registration and voting, prescribed by New York's Constitution, Art. II, \u00a7 1, and by its Election Law, McKinney's Consol.Laws, c. 17, \u00a7\u00a7 150 and 168, as amended (the ability to read and write English, the administration of a literacy test, and the presentation of evidence of literacy in lieu of the test), had not been used during the preceding 10 years 'for the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color,' App. 6a; that the State's literacy requirements were suspended in 1970 and remained suspended; that after enactment of the 1965 Act, the New York City Board of Elections provided English-Spanish affidavits to be executed in lieu of a diploma or certificate in conformity with the requirements of the Act; and that, beginning in 1964 and continuing through 1971, with the exception of 1967, there were voter registration drives every summer designed to increase the number of registered voters in the three named counties.\n\n\n29\nNew York and the United States stipulated that the Government could file its answer or other pleading by March 10, 1972. The answer was filed on that day. The Government therein admitted that English-Spanish affidavits were provided by the City Board of Elections but averred on information and belief, that such affidavits were not so provided prior to 1967. The answer also alleged that the United States was without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the plaintiff's allegation that the literacy tests were administered with no intention or effect to abridge or deny the right to vote on the basis of race or color.\n\n\n30\nOn March 17 New York filed its motion for summary judgment. This was supported by affidavits from the Administrator for the Board of Elections in the City of New York 'which includes the counties of New York, Bronx and Kings,' the Chief of the Bureau of Elementary and Secondary Educational Testing of the New York State Education Department, and the respective Chief Clerks of the New York, Bronx, and Brooklyn Borough Offices of the New York City Board of Elections. App. 15a\u201432a. These affidavits stated that those instances where the suspension of literacy tests had been ignored or overlooked by election officials were isolated and that steps had been taken to resolve that problem. The affidavits also stated that since 1964, with the exception of 1967, the Board of Elections had conducted summer voter-registration drives directed particularly to highdensity black population areas. In its memorandum, filed with the District Court, in support of its motion, New York presented a history of its use of literacy tests11 and concluded, '(s)ince it was never the practice of administering the tests to discriminate against any person on account of race or color, and since the filing requirements of the Voting Rights Act are leading to delays which may well disrupt the political process in New York, this action for declaratory judgment has been brought.' Memorandum 4\u20145. See South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S., at 332, 86 S.Ct., at 820.\n\n\n31\nTwo and one-half weeks later, on April 3, the United States filed its formal consent, hereinabove described, to the entry of the declaratory judgment for which New York had moved. The accompanying affidavit of the Assistant Attorney General stated that the Department of Justice had conducted 'an investigation which consisted of examination of registration records in selected precincts in each covered county, interviews of certain election and registration officials and interviews of persons familiar with registration activity in black and Puerto Rican neighborhoods in those counties.' App. 40a. The Assistant Attorney General then reached the conclusion, App. 42a\u201443a, quoted supra, at 349.\n\n\n32\nAppellants' motion to intervene was filed April 7. Appellants asserted that if New York were successful in the present action, the appellants would be deprived of the protections afforded by \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5; that they 'would be legally bound' thereby in their simultaneously filed \u00a7 5 action in the Southern District of New York; and that the latter action 'would necessarily fail.' App. 45a.12 The appellants also alleged that the \u00a7 5 suit asserted that New York 'has gerrymandered Assembly, Senatorial and Congressional districts in Kings, Bronx and New York counties so that, on purpose and in effect, the right to vote will be denied on account of race or color.' Ibid. Thus, it was said, the disposition of the present suit might impair or impede the appellants' ability to protect their interests in registering to vote, voting, and seeking public office. App. 46a. It was further claimed that during the preceding three weeks attorneys in the Department of Justice thrice had represented to appellants' counsel that the United States would oppose New York's motion for summary judgment.13 'At no time did any of the three Justice Department attorneys . . . inquire of counsel for (appellants) whether he or any of the (appellants) had information or evidence which would support the government's alleged position that sections 4 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act should continue to be applied to Kings, Bronx and New York counties.' Ibid.\n\n\n33\nThere was also filed an affidavit of Eric Schnapper, one of the attorneys for the appellants. This repeated the allegations contained in the motion to intervene and also asserted that on March 21 the affiant advised a Department of Justice attorney that when the New York redistricting laws were submitted to the Department, he wished to submit material and arguments in opposition to their approval; that on March 23 he was advised by another Department attorney that papers were being prepared in opposition to New York's motion for summary judgment; that he informed the attorney that the appellants were considering the institution of an action in the Southern District of New York; that on April 3 he was advised by the Department of Justice that it would have no objection to the institution of the New York suit; and that in the afternoon of April 5 he was informed by telephone for the first time that two days earlier the United States had consented to New York's motion for summary judgment. App. 48a\u201451a.\n\n\n34\nWith the motion to intervene the appellants filed a proposed answer to appellees' amended complaint and a brief memorandum of points and authorities. The latter suggested the failure of the Attorney General 'to investigate the relevant facts,' namely, 'whether there are differences in the literacy rates of whites and non-whites, particularly if they are do (sic) to unequal or discriminatory public education. Gaston County v. United States, 395 U.S. 285, 89 S.Ct. 1720, 23 L.Ed.2d 309 (1969).' This suggestion was also made in the proposed answer. App. 65a\u201466a.\n\n\n35\nThe United States took no position with respect to the appellants' motion to intervene. New York opposed the motion on six grounds. The first was untimeliness in that the suit had been pending for more than four months, an article about it had appeared in early February in the New York Times, and the appellants did not deny that they had knowledge of the pendency of the action. The second was failure to allege appropriate supporting facts. The third was the lack of a requisite interest in that none of the appellants asserted he was a victim of discriminatory application of the literacy test; rather, the motion to intervene was subordinate to the appellants' real interest in invalidating New York's reapportionment of its assembly, senate, and congressional districts, as evidenced by the institution of their action in the Southern District of New York. The fourth was adequate representation of the appellants' interest by the United States. The fifth was that delay in the granting of the motion for summary judgment would prejudice New York and jeopardize the impending primary elections for offices of Assembly, Senate, and Congress, as well as for delegates to the upcoming Democratic National Convention. The sixth was that the appellants and others who claimed discrimination still could raise those issues in the state and federal courts of New York. Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to the Motion to Intervene 1\u20148. Like reasons were asserted in a supporting affidavit of an Assistant New York Attorney General. App. 67a\u201470a.\n\n\n36\nOn April 13 the three-judge court entered its order denying the appellants' motion to intervene and granting summary judgment for New York. App. 71a\u201472a.\n\n\n37\nOn April 24 the appellants filed a motion to alter judgment on the ground, among others, that their motion to intervene was timely since neither the appellants nor their counsel knew of the \u00a7 4(a) action until March 21.14 The appellants now asserted that evidence was available to demonstrate that in the three counties education afforded non-white children by New York was substantially inferior to that afforded white children and that 'this difference resulted in disparities in white and non-white illiteracy rates among persons otherwise eligible to vote in those counties during the 10 years prior to the filing of the instant action.' App. 73a\u201474a. Thus 'a full evidentiary hearing is required before making any finding of fact as to whether plaintiff's literacy tests discriminated on the basis of race.' Finally, the appellants asserted that the District Court 'should not have approved the consent judgment desired by plaintiff and defendant without first soliciting the intervention of responsible interested parties and requiring the United States to undertake a more thorough investigation of the relevant facts.' Ibid.\n\n\n38\nThe District Court promptly denied the Motion to Alter Judgment. App. 117a.\n\n\n39\nSubsequently, while the appeal was pending in this Court, two additional facts came to light and are authorized by the parties for our consideration. The first is that Mr. Schnapper, who executed the above-described affidavits, did not begin his employment as an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc., until March 9, 1972. The second is that 'Justice Department attorneys met with appellants Stewart and Fortune in January 1972 during the course of their investigation; although the Justice Department attorneys recall informing Stewart and Fortune that this case was pending, neither Stewart nor Fortune can remember being so informed.' Reply Brief for Appellants 3 n. 1; Brief for United States 36.\n\nIV\n\n40\nThe foregoing detailed recital of the facts and of the history of the case is necessary because of the discretionary nature of the District Court's order we are called upon to review. Our task is to determine whether, upon the facts available to it at that time, the court erred in denying the appellants' motion to intervene.\n\n\n41\nIntervention in a federal court suit is governed by Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 24.15 Whether intervention be claimed of right or as permissive, it is at once apparent, from the initial words of both Rule 24(a) and Rule 24(b), that the application must be 'timely.' If it is untimely, intervention must be denied. Thus, the court where the action is pending must first be satisfied as to timeliness.16 Although the point to which the suit has progressed is one factor in the determination of timeliness, it is not solely dispositive. Timeliness is to be determined from all the circumstances.17 And it is to be determined by the court in the exercise of its sound discretion; unless that discretion is abused, the court's ruling will not be disturbed on review.18\n\n\n42\nWith these accepted principles in mind, we readily conclude that the District Court's denial of the appellants' motion to intervene was proper because of the motion's untimeliness, and that the denial was not an abuse of the court's discretion:\n\n\n43\n1. The court could reasonably have concluded that appellants knew or should have known of the pendency of the \u00a7 4(a) action because of an informative February article in the New York Times discussing the controversial aspect of the suit;19 public comment by community leaders; the size and astuteness of the membership and staff of the organizational appellant; and the questioning of two of the individual appellants themselves by Department of Justice attorneys investigating the use of literacy tests in New York.\n\n\n44\n2. We, however, need not confine our evaluation of abuse of discretion to the facts just mentioned, for the record amply demonstrates that appellants failed to protect their interest in a timely fashion after March 21, 1972, the date they allegedly were first informed of the pendency of the action. At that point, the suit was over three months old and had reached a critical stage. The United States had answered New York's complaint on March 10 and in that answer had clearly indicated that it was without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of New York's allegation that the State's literacy tests were administered without regard to race or color. App. 13a. New York, in reliance upon this answer, then filed its motion for summary judgment. The only step remaining was for the United States either to oppose or to consent to the entry of summary judgment. This was the status of the suit at the time the appellants concede they were aware of its existence. It was obvious that there was a strong likelihood that the United States would consent to the entry of judgment since its answer revealed that it was without information with which it could oppose the motion for summary judgment. Thus, it was incumbent upon the appellants, at that stage of the proceedings, to take immediate affirmative steps to protect their interests either by supplying the Department of Justice with any information they possessed concerning the employment of literacy tests in a way designed to deny New York citizens of the right to vote on account of race or color, or by presenting that information to the District Court itself by way of an immediate motion to intervene.20 Appellants failed to take either of these affirmative steps. They chose, rather, to rely on representations said to have been made by Department of Justice attorneys during the course of telephone conversations. The content of the representations allegedly made by the attorneys is a matter of dispute. Brief for United States 46\u201447. Indeed, it appears from the affidavit filed by appellants' counsel in support of the motion to alter the judgment that apellants were not preparing, prior to the 'night of April 6\u20147,' to file a motion to intervene or even to file their New York federal action seeking the enjoin the 1972 elections. See n. 14, supra.\n\n\n45\n3. It is also apparent that there were no unusual circumstances warranting intervention since (a) no appellant alleged an injury, personal to him, resulting from the discriminatory use of a literacy test, (b) appellants' claim of inadequate representation by the United States was unsubstantiated, (c) appellants would not be foreclosed from challenging congressional and state legislative redistricting plans on the grounds that they were the product of improper racial gerrymandering, cf. Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110 (1960), and Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 603, 11 L.Ed.2d 512 (1964), (d) appellants were free to renew their motion to intervene following the entry of summary judgment since the District Court was required, under \u00a7 4(a) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973b(a), to retain jurisdiction for five years after judgment, and, (e) in any event, no citizen of New York could be denied the right to vote in the near future since all literacy tests have been suspended until August 6, 1975. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973aa.\n\n\n46\n4. Finally, in view of the then rapidly approaching primary elections in New York and of the final date for filing nominating petitions to participate in those elections, the granting of a motion to intervene possessed the potential for seriously disrupting the State's electoral process with the result that primary and general elections would then have been based on population figures from the 1960 census and more than 10 years old.\n\n\n47\nWe therefore conclude that the motion to intervene was untimely and that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the appellants' motion. See Apache County v. United States, 256 F.Supp. 903 (D.C.1966); United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 333 F.Supp. 1100 (SDNY), aff'd sub nom. Syufy Enterprises v. United States, 404 U.S. 802, 92 S.Ct. 79, 30 L.Ed.2d 37 (1971). This makes it unnecessary for us to consider whether other conditions for intervention under Rule 24 were satisfied.\n\n\n48\nAffirmed.\n\n\n49\nMr. Justice MARSHALL took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n50\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\n\n51\nWhen two mighty political agencies such as the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., and the Attorney General of New York in Albany agree that there is no racial discrimination in voting in three New York counties although the historic record1 suggests it, it is time to take a careful look and not let this litigation be ended by an agreement between friendly political allies.\n\n\n52\nThe Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970 were specifically aimed at New York\u2014particularly Bronx, Kings, and New York Counties. It was pointed out in the debates that under the earlier Act these counties were not included, that while in the 1964 election more than 50% of the voters were registered and more than 50% voted, in the 1968 election 50% were not registered or voting. 116 Cong.Rec. 6654, 6659. It was pointed out that New York's literacy requirement was enacted with the view of discriminating on the basis of race., Id., at 6660. New York blacks were illiterate because their education, if any, had been in second-class schools elsewhere. Id., at 6661. It was emphasized that wherever the blacks had been educated it was unconstitutional to discriminate against them on the basis of race even though illiterate. Id., at 5533. The use of literacy tests in New York tended to deter blacks from registering, it was said. Ibid. And it was pointed out that literacy tests had a greater impact on blacks and other minorities than on any white because literacy was higher among whites. Id., at 5532\u20145549.\n\n\n53\nIn the face of this history, the United States did not call one witness or submit a single document or make even a feeble protest to New York's claim that it was lily-white. The United States has no defense to offer. The desultory way in which the United States acted is illustrated by the fact that although the Act requires the District Court to retain jurisdiction of the cause for five years, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973b(a), the United States did not even make the request. It capitulated completely. And yet the blacks, the Americans of Puerto Rican ancestry, and other minorities victimized by illiteracy tests clamor in their way for representation. Only NAACP offers it in this case. The investigation made by the Department of Justice has all the earmarks of a whitewash.\n\n\n54\nThe Attorney General had testified before Congress:2\n\n\n55\n'(I)t is clear that Negro voting in most Deep South Counties      subjected to both literacy test suspension and onscene      enrollment by Federal registrars is now higher than Negro      vote participation in the ghettos of the two Northern cities      New York and Los Angeles\u2014where literacy tests are still in      use. In non-literacy test Northern jurisdictions like      Chicago, Cleveland and Philadelphia, Negro registration and      voting ratios are higher than in Los Angeles and (especially)      New York. . ..'\n\n\n56\nYet, none of these assertions were given the District Court nor was any attempt made to develop evidence along these lines.\n\n\n57\nThis suit by the State of New York to get an exemption for the three counties started on December 3, 1971. On March 10, 1972, the United States filed its answer and on March 17, 1972, New York moved for summary judgment. On March 21, 1972, NAACP was advised by the Department of Justice that the latter would oppose New York's motion for summary judgment. Out of the blue the Department of Justice on April 4, 1972, consented to the entry of a decree exempting the three New York counties from the Act. The motion to intervene was promptly filed April 7, 1972.\n\n\n58\nThe answer filed by NAACP on April 7, 1972, alleges that the literacy test administered by New York deterred minorities from registering, that it was administered by whites, that social gerrymandering was so widespread and successful that minorities were discouraged from voting, and that New York produced illiterate blacks through operating inferior black schools inferior in educational facilities, and inferior in teachers, inferior in expenditures per capita.\n\n\n59\nIt is assumed, of course, that the United States adequately represents the public interest in cases of this sort. But on the face of this record of transactions that the United States has approved or does not contest, it is clear that it does not adequately represent the public interest. Intervention as of right under Rule 24(a)(2) should therefore be allowed. See Cascade Natural Gas Corp. v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 386 U.S. 129, 135 136, 87 S.Ct. 932, 936, 937, 17 L.Ed.2d 814.\n\n\n60\nHere it is plainly evident that the United States is an eager and willing partner with its allies in New York to foreclose inquiry into barriers to minority voting. What the facts may produce, no one knows. All that is requested is a hearing on the merits. The fresh air of publicity that only a fair and full trial in court can produce should be allowed to ventilate a case that has all the earmarks of a cozy arrangement to suppress the facts evidence which, if proved, would be adequate as a basis for relief in a case from the South. See Gaston County v. United States, 395 U.S. 285, 89 S.Ct. 1720, 23 L.Ed.2d 309. This evidence, if proved, should be equally adequate in the North.\n\n\n61\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, dissenting.\n\n\n62\nIn my view, the District Court erred in denying appellants' motion for leave to intervene in this suit under \u00a7 4(a) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973b(a). The case plainly turns on its facts, and its impact on the development of principles governing intervention will doubtless be small. But what is ultimately at stake in this suit by New York to obtain an exemption under the Voting Rights Act is the applicability of the protections of the Act to 2.2 million minority-group members residing in three New York counties. According to appellants, the total number of minority-group members affected by all previous exemptions combined was less than 100,000.\n\n\n63\nAt the same time that the District Court denied the motion to intervene, it granted the State's motion for summary judgment, thereby exempting these three counties from the coverage of the Act. The United States, defendant in the suit, consented to the entry of summary judgment. As a result, the contention that appellants were prepared to urge\u2014namely, that the grant of an exemption would nullify the specific congressional intent to extend the protections of the Act to the class represented by appellants\u2014was never laid before the Court.\n\n\n64\nIn upholding the denial of leave to intervene, the Court reasons that appellants' motion, filed four days after the United States consented to a grant of summary judgment, was untimely. In the Court's view, appellants should have made their motion during the brief period between the filing of New York's motion for summary judgment and the announcement by the United States that it would not contest that motion. The Court states, with the benefit of hindsight, that it was\n\n\n65\n'Obvious that there was a strong likelihood that the United      States would consent to the entry of judgment since its      answer revealed that it was without information with which it      could oppose the motion for summary judgment. Thus, it was      incumbent upon the appellants, at that stage of the      proceedings, to take immediate affirmative steps to protect      their interests either by supplying the Department of Justice      with any information they possessed concerning the employment      of literacy tests in a way designed to deny New York citizens      of the right to vote on account of race or color, or by      presenting that information to the District Court itself by      way of an immediate motion to intervene.' Ante, at 367.\n\n\n66\nThe timeliness of a motion to intervene is determined, not by reference to the date on which the suit began or the date on which the would-be intervenors learned that it was pending, but rather by reference to the date when the movants learned that intervention was needed to protect their interests. See Diaz v. Southern Drilling Corp., 427 F.2d 1118, 1125 (CA5 1970); cf. Cascade Natural Gas Corp. v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 386 U.S. 129, 87 S.Ct. 932, 17 L.Ed.2d 814 (1967). Prior to the announcement that the United States would not contest the motion for summary judgment, appellants could not have known that intervention was needed to protect their interests and the interests of the class they represented. In an affidavit filed in connection with the motion to intervene, appellants' attorney stated that he had been advised by three different Justice Department attorneys that the United States would oppose New York's motion for summary judgment. The Court suggests that the contents of the representations made by these attorneys is 'a matter of dispute.' Ante, at 368. The matter was not in dispute, however, at the time the affidavit was filed,* nor did it become the subject of dispute until five months later when the Government filed in this Court its Motion to Dismiss or Affirm. Even then, the United States did not deny that appellants had been offered certain assurances by Government attorneys, but stated only that the affidavit was not 'an accurate representation of the substance of the conversations between counsel for appellants and attorneys for the government.' Motion to Dismiss or Affirm, filed Sept. 13, 1972, p. 4 n. 3.\n\n\n67\nThus, the record before the District Court indicated reasonable reliance on the Government's assurances that the suit would not be settled. And appellants did move to intervene within four days of learning that they could no longer rely on the Government to protect their interests. On that record, the District Court was obligated to conclude that the motion was timely filed. Since the allegation of untimeliness was, in my view, the only nonfrivolous objection to the motion, the District Court's denial of the motion was unquestionably erroneous. I dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n 'To assure that the right of citizens of the United States to vote is not denied or abridged on account of race or color, no citizen shall be denied the right to vote in any Federal, State, or local election because of his failure to comply with any test or device in any State with respect to which the determinations have been made\nunder subsection (b) of this section or in any political subdivision with respect to which such determinations have been made as a separate unit, unless the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in an action for a declaratory judgment brought by such State or subdivision against the United States has determined that no such test or device has been used during the ten years preceding the filing of the action for the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color . . ..\n'An action pursuant to this subsection shall be heard and determined by a court of three judges in accordance with the provisions of section 2284 of Title 28 and any appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court. The court shall retain jurisdiction of any action pursuant to this subsection for five years after judgment and shall reopen the action upon motion of the Attorney General alleging that a test or device has been used for the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.\n'If the Attorney General determines that he has no reason to believe that any such test or device has been used during the ten years preceding the filing of the action for the purpose or with the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color, he shall consent to the entry of such judgment.'\n\n\n2\n The appellants describe themselves, in their motion to intervene, as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, New York City Region of New York State Conference of Branches; four duly qualified black voters in Kings County, New York; and one duly qualified Puerto Rican voter in that county. Two of the individual appellants are also members of the New York State Assembly and another is a member of the New York State Senate. App. 44a.\n\n\n3\n The motion, App. 44a\u201447a, does not differentiate between intervention of right and permissive intervention, under subdivisions (a) and (b), respectively, of Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 24. Neither does it state that one, rather than the other, is claimed. At oral argument, counsel said that in the District Court the appellants sought intervention as of right. Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. In this Court appellants suggest that they were also entitled to permis-\nsive intervention. Tr. of Oral Arg. 9; Brief for Appellants 26 n. 39. In view of our ruling on the issue of timeliness, we make no point of the distinction between the two types of intervention.\n\n\n4\n 'No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.'\n\n\n5\n In Georgia v. United States, 411 U.S. 526, 93 S.Ct. 1702, 36 L.Ed.2d 472 (1973), the Court held that a State's reapportionment plan, which has the potential for diluting Negro voting power, is a 'standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting,' within the meaning of \u00a7 5 of the Act. See Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 89 S.Ct. 817, 22 L.Ed.2d 1 (1969).\n\n\n6\n But see Hearings on H.R. 6400 before Subcommittee No. 5 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., ser. 2, pp. 90\u201491 (1965).\n\n\n7\n 'In every civil action brought in any district court of the United States under any of said Acts, wherein the United States is complainant, an appeal from the final judgment of the district court will lie only to the Supreme Court.'\n\n\n8\n 'Except as otherwise provided by law, any party may appeal to the Supreme Court from an order granting or denying, after notice and hearing, an interlocutory or permanent injunction in any civil action, suit or proceeding required by any Act of Congress to be heard and determined by a district court of three judges.'\n\n\n9\n Although the Director of the Bureau of the Census determined, on March 15, 1971, that less than 50% of the persons of voting age residing in the three named New York counties voted in the presidential election of November 1968, it was stated on behalf of the appellees in oral argument that a complete set of census statistics was not available to the State of New York until October 15, 1971. Tr. of Oral Arg. 41. The appellants, however, in the complaint filed by them in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in their \u00a7 5 suit against the New York City Board of Elections and others, No. 72 Civ. 1460, alleged that census information on which reapportionment was based was made available to the State no later than September 1, 1971. App. 59a. We do not know which of these dates is correct. It is clear, in any event, that census data for the redrawing of congressional and legislative district lines was not available to New York until the fall of 1971.\n\n\n10\n New York claims that the primary reason for filing its \u00a7 4(a) suit was to insure that the imminent 1972 elections would be held on the basis of district lines drawn according to population figures from the 1970 census. It is said that the lateness in obtaining the figures, see n. 9, supra, and the concomitant impossibility of redrawing lines before early 1972 made it highly unlikely that the State would be able to obtain from the Attorney General of the United States any \u00a7 5 clearance for the redistricting legislation prior to April 4, the first day for circulating nominating petitions for the June 20 primary. Thus, by obtaining a favorable result in a \u00a7 4(a) suit, New York could bypass the submission of its redistricting plan to the Attorney General. Tr. of Oral Arg. 41\u201442.\n\n\n11\n The New York Election Law, \u00a7 168, as amended, provides that 'a new voter may present as evidence of literacy' a certificate that he has completed the sixth grade of an approved elementary school or of a school 'accredited by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in which school instruction is carried on predominantly in the English language.' On July 28, 1966, the State's Attorney General issued an opinion to the effect that New York may not require literacy in English from persons educated in Puerto Rico. Op.Atty.Gen.N.Y., 1966, pp. 121, 123.\n\n\n12\n While the present case was pending in the District Court, the New York Legislature on January 14, 1972, completed its work of redrawing assembly and senate district lines and enacted legislation altering those boundaries. N.Y.Laws 1972, c. 11. On January 24, the State's Attorney General submitted the redistricting plan to the Attorney General of the United States pursuant to \u00a7 5 of the 1965 Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c. On March 14, three days before New York's motion for summary judgment was filed, the United States Attorney General rejected New York's submission on the ground that it was lacking in information required by the applicable regulations set forth at 36 Fed.Reg. 18186\u201418190 (1971). On March 28 the New York Legislature enacted legislation redefining the boundaries of the State's congressional districts. N.Y.Laws 1972, c. 76. The congressional changes were not submitted for approval under \u00a7 5.\n\n\n13\n The United States takes the position 'that the statements of appellants' counsel are not an accurate representation of the conversations between him and these government attorneys.'

{"text":"409 U.S. 100\n93 S.Ct. 354\n34 L.Ed.2d 335\nMarilyn COOLv.UNITED STATES.\nNo. 72-72.\nDec. 4, 1972.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari is granted.\n\n\n2\nIn this case, the court below held in effect that in a criminal trial, the jury may be instructed to ignore defense testimony unless it believes beyond a reasonable doubt that the testimony is true. That holding is fundamentally inconsistent with our prior decisions in In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), and Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967), and must therefore be reversed.\n\n\n3\nAfter a jury trial, petitioner was found guilty of possessing and concealing, with intent to defraud, counterfeit obligations of the United States. The evidence showed that on June 2, 1970, petitioner, her hubsand, and one Robert E. Voyles were traveling together by car between St. Louis, Missouri, and Brazil, Indiana. Upon reaching Brazil, Voyles left petitioner and her husband and passed two counterfeit bills at a local store. He was then arrested shortly after he entered the car in which petitioner and her husband were waiting.\n\n\n4\nAfter his arrest, Voyles was placed in the police car and taken to the station house. Petitioner and her husband were told to follow in their own car. A Mr. Baumunk testified that he saw petitioner throw a paper sack out of the car window as petitioner was following the police car. The bag was subsequently found to contain counterfeit bills. Police also found three counterfeit bills crumpled up under the right seat of petitioner's car.\n\n\n5\nAlthough petitioner testified in her own defense, she relied primarily on the testimony of Voyles. Voyles freely admitted his own guilt,1 but steadfastly insisted that neither petitioner nor her husband had anything to do with the crime. He testified that petitioner had merely agreed to give him a ride and knew nothing about the counterfeit bills that he carried with him. When the car stopped in Brazil, Voyles allegedly removed some of the counterfeit bills from his satchel which he kept in petitioner's trunk, and concealed the rest of the bills in a sack which he placed under the front bumper by the headlight. The defense argued that it was this sack that Baumunk saw fall to the ground as petitioner drove to the police station. Voyles also stated that after he had rejoined petitioner, he saw police approaching the car and threw the remaining bills on his person onto the car floor, again without the knowledge of petitioner. Petitioner thus asserts that she was not in knowing possession of the bills on the car floor.\n\n\n6\nWith the case in this posture, the Government's position clearly depended upon its ability to discredit Voyles, since his testimony was completely exculpatory. Over strenuous defense objection,2 the trial judge gave the jury a lengthy 'accomplice instruction' to be used in evaluating Voyles' testimony. After first defining the word 'accomplice' and warning that an accomplice's testimony is 'open to suspicion,' the judge made the following statement: 'However, I charge you that the testimony of an accomplice is competent evidence and it is for you to pass upon the credibility thereof. If the testimony carries conviction and you are convinced it is true beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury should give it the same effect as you would to a witness not in any respect implicated in the alleged crime and you are not only justified, but it is your duty, not to throw this testimony out because it comes from a tainted source.' (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n7\nThe clear implication of this instruction was that the jury should disregard Voyles' testimony unless it was 'convinced it is true beyond a reasonable doubt.'3 Such an instruction places an improper burden on the defense and allows the jury to convict despite its failure to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.4\n\n\n8\nAccomplice instructions have long been in use and have been repeatedly approved. See, e.g., Holmgren v. United States, 217 U.S. 509, 523\u2014524, 30 S.Ct. 588, 591\u2014592, 54 L.Ed. 861 (1910). In most instances, they represent no more than a commonsense recognition that an accomplice may have a special interest in testifying, thus casting doubt upon his veracity. See, e.g., Crawford v. United States, 212 U.S. 183, 204, 29 S.Ct. 260, 268, 53 L.Ed. 465 (1909). But in most of the recorded cases, the instruction has been used when the accomplice turned State's evidence and testified against the defendant. See generally McMillen v. United States, 386 F.2d 29 (CA1 1967), and cases cited therein. No constitutional problem is posed when the judge instructs a jury to receive the prosecution's accomplice testimony 'with care and caution.' See, e.g., United States v. George, 319 F.2d 77, 80 (CA6 1963). Cf. United States v. Nolte, 440 F.2d 1124 (CA5 1971).\n\n\n9\nBut there is an essential difference between instructing a jury on the care with which it should scrutinize certain evidence in determining how much weight to accord it and instructing a jury, as the judge did here, that as a predicate to the consideration of certain evidence, it must find it true beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n10\nIn Washington v. Texas, supra, we held that a criminal defendant has a Sixth Amendment right to present to the jury exculpatory testimony of an accomplice. The instruction given below impermissibly obstructs the exercise of that right by totally excluding relevant evidence unless the jury makes a preliminary determination that it is extremely reliable.\n\n\n11\nMoreover, the instruction also has the effect of substantially reducing the Government's burden of proof. We held in In re Winship, supra, that the Constitution requires proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It is possible that Voyles' testimony would have created a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury, but that it was not considered because the testimony itself was not believable beyond a reasonable doubt. By creating an artificial barrier to the consideration of relevant defense testimony putatively credible by a preponderance of the evidence, the trial judge reduced the level of proof necessary for the Government to carry its burden. Indeed, where, as here, the defendant's case rests almost entirely on accomplice testimony, the effect of the judge's instructions is to require the defendant to establish his innocence beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n12\nBecause such a requirement is plainly inconsistent with the constitutionally rooted presumption of innocence, the conviction must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n13\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n14\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n15\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice BLACKMUN concur, dissenting.\n\n\n16\nI believe that the Court's fine-spun parsing of the trial judge's charge to the jury turns the appellate review of this case into the sort of 'quest for error' which was said in Bihn v. United States, 328 U.S. 633, 638, 66 S.Ct. 1172, 1174, 90 L.Ed. 1485 (1946), to be forbidden by Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,1 and by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111.2\n\n\n17\nThe testimony of the witness Voyles, called by petitioner as a witness in her behalf, presented the trial judge with something of a dilemma in determining how he should charge the jury. Much of Voyles' testimony tended to exculpate petitioner, but there were significant aspects of it that did not. He substantiated the fact that the petitioner and her husband3 had traveled with him from St. Louis to Brazil, Indiana. He corroborated prosecution evidence that both petitioner and her husband gave the same false last name of Gibbs when booked at the police station in Brazil. He also suggested a closeness to petitioner's husband which was scarcely helpful to their defense when he testified that 'I was a little sore at Mike (petitioner's husband), because I thought Mike should help me (get out on bond).'\n\n\n18\nThe trial judge made clear in his colloquy with counsel, while dealing with their objections to the charge, that he was concerned about the ambivalence of Voyles' testimony and felt it necessary to give the charge relating to accomplices. Petitioner's counsel in objecting to that portion of the charge did so on a quite different ground from that now sustained by the Court; the ground of objection stated to the trial court was apparently that the mention of the term 'accomplice' to the jury suggested that petitioner and her husband were in fact guilty. Such a ground of objection was wholly without merit, since, as the Court of Appeals pointed out in its opinion in this case, the instruction left it entirely to the jury to determine whether or not the facts existed that would make Voyles an accomplice.\n\n\n19\nThe trial court gave 36 separate instructions to the jury which covered some 52 pages of the transcript in this case. The instruction in question covers two pages, and the Court reverses the conviction on the basis of one sentence in that one instruction. The trial judge repeatedly emphasized to the jury that the Government was obligated to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Typical is the following statement, which is repeated throughout the instructions in at least half a dozen places:\n\n\n20\n'The entire burden of proof is upon the Government from the      beginning to the end of the trial and this burden of proof      never shifts from the Government to the defendants, and the      defendants are not bound to prove their innocence, offer any      excuse, or explain anything . . ..'\n\n\n21\nThe record before us does not indicate that either counsel so much as mentioned the accomplice instruction in his argument to the jury. Nenetheless, the Court concludes that because the instruction contained a 'negative pregnant' that could be taken to mean that the jurors should reject Voyles' testimony if they had a reasonable doubt as to its veracity, the conviction is to be reversed.\n\n\n22\nI had thought the day long past when even appellate courts of the first instance, such as the Court of Appeals in this case, parsed instructions and engaged in nice semantic distinctions in the absence of any showing that would satisfy an ordinary lawyer or layman that substantial rights of one of the parties had been prejudiced by the supposed error. If the nuance of the instruction upon which reversal is now based did not suggest itself to petitioner's trial counsel, it seems doubtful that it suggested itself to the jury either:\n\n\n23\n'A party must make every reasonable effort to secure from the      trial court correct rulings, or such at least as are      satisfactory to him, before he will be permitted to ask any      review by the appellate tribunal; and to that end he must be      distinct and specific in his objections and exceptions. . . .      '. . . (J) ustice itself, and fairness to the court which      makes the rulings complained of, require that the attention      of that court shall be specifically called to the precise      point to which exception is taken, that it may have an      opportunity to reconsider the matter and remove the ground of      exception.\" Allis v. United States, 155 U.S. 117, 122, 15      S.Ct. 36, 38, 39 L.Ed. 91 (1894), quoting Harvey v. Tyler, 2      Wall. 328, 339, 17 L.Ed. 871 (1865).\n\n\n24\nNor, as pointed out above, did this particular instruction of the trial court stand alone; it was incorporated into a series of instructions that had as their predominant theme that the burden of proof was upon the Government at every stage to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court's instructions are to be taken as a whole, and even if an isolated passage might be error if standing by itself, that alone is not a sufficient ground for reversal. Boyd v. United States, 271 U.S. 104, 107, 46 S.Ct. 442, 443, 70 L.Ed. 857 (1926).\n\n\n25\nThe Court's reversal on the ground that one of the instructions contained a 'negative pregnant' smacks more of the scholastic jurisprudence whose shortcomings led to the enactment of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111 than it does of the commonsense approach to appellate review that that section mandates.\n\n\n\n1\n At the time of his testimony, Voyles had already pleaded guilty to a charge of complicity in the possession and concealment of counterfeit notes.\n\n\n2\n The dissent suggests that the defendant objected to the accomplice instruction solely on the ground that use of the word 'accomplice' suggested that the defendant was guilty. Although the defense objection was not a model of clarity, it seems apparent that it was grounded more broadly on the trial judge's decision to give the standard accomplice instruction despite the fact that the accomplice was a defense witness. The defense attorney stated: 'I take exception to Instruction No. 16, as it's misleading. I don't think it belongs in this cause. There was no accomplice testified (sic) for the Government, and this could mislead them as to the person who was accused of this crime and has already pled guilty, as making an accomplice of him, when actually he is not an accomplice, because they are not involved in the crime.' (Emphasis added.) Certainly, the trial judge understood this objection to be directed to his decision to give the standard cautionary instruction even though the alleged accomplice was called by the defendant. In colloquy with the defense attorney, the judge stated: 'The next, 'accomplice,' the evidence of both the Government and the defendants may be considered by the jury in determining the guilt or innocence, no matter who produces the witness. . . . Now there's a lot of inferences can be drawn from one item of evidence or another, and that's for the jury to decide. So long as there is some evidence, the instruction must be given. It hits both ways on that point.' (Emphasis added.) Nor did the Court of Appeals indicate any doubt that defendant's objection was sufficient to preserve the point on appeal.\n\n\n3\n True, the instruction was couched in positive terms. It told the jury to consider the evidence if it believed it true beyond a reasonable doubt. But the statement contained a negative pregnant as well. There is an unacceptable risk that jurors might have thought they were to reject the evidence\u2014'throw (it) out,' in the words of the trial judge\u2014if they had a reasonable doubt as to its veracity.\n\n\n4\n In the next paragraph of his instruction, the judge stated: 'I further instruct you that testimony of an accomplice may alone and uncorroborated support your verdict of guilty of the charges in the Indictment if believed by you to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the essential elements of the charges in the Indictment against the defendants.' In light of the fact that the only accomplice testimony in the case was exculpatory, this instruction was confusing to say the least. But even if it is assumed that Voyles' testimony was to some extent inculpatory, the instruction was still fundamentally unfair in that it told the jury that it could convict solely on the basis of accomplice testimony without telling it that it could acquit on this basis. Even had there been no other error, the conviction would have to be reversed on the basis of this instruction alone.\n\n\n1\n 'Any error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.' Fed.Rule Crim.Pric. 52(a).\n\n\n2\n 'On the hearing of any appeal or writ of certiorari in any case, the court shall give judgment after an examination of the record without regard to errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.' 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111.\n\n\n3\n The petitioner and her husband were tried and convicted together on the counterfeiting charges. Both appealed their convictions to the Seventh Circuit, which affirmed both. Petitioner's husband has not sought certiorari to have his conviction reviewed.\n\n\n","label":0}

The District Court, relying primarily on Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 91 S.Ct. 780, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (where the Court held that a State could not consistently with due process and equal protection requirements, deny access to divorce courts to indigents unable to pay filing and other fees), held the bankruptcy fee provisions, as applied to appellee, an unconstitutional denial of Fifth Amendment rights of due process, including equal protection. Held: This case is not controlled by Boddie, supra, For here access to courts is not the only conceivable relief available to bankrupts; the filing-fee requyirement does not deny an indigent the equal protection of the laws, since there is no constitutional right to obtain a discharge of one's debts in bankruptcy; the right to a discharge in bankruptcy is not a 'fundamental' right demanding a compelling governmental interest as a precondition to regulation; and there is a rational basis for the fee requirement.

Korman, New York City, for appellant.\nKalman Finkel, New York City, for appellee.\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe Bankruptcy Act and one of this Court's complementary Orders in Bankruptcy impose fees and make the payment of those fees a condition to a discharge in voluntary bankruptcy.\n\n\n2\nAppellee Kras, an indigent petitioner in bankruptcy, challenged the fees on Fifth Amendment grounds. Upon receiving notice of the constitutional issue in the District Court, the Government moved to intervene as of right under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2403 and Rule 24(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Leave to intervene was granted. The District Court held the fee provisions to be unconstitutional as applied to Kras. 331 F.Supp. 1207 (EDNY 1971). It reached this conclusion in the face of an earlier contrary holding by a unanimous First Circuit. In re Garland, 428 F.2d 1185 (1 Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 966, 91 S.Ct. 1624, 29 L.Ed.2d 130 (1971). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, the Government appealed. We noted probable jurisdiction. 405 U.S. 915, 92 S.Ct. 955, 30 L.Ed.2d 784 (1972).\n\n\n3\n* Section 14(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 32(b)(2), provides that, upon the expiration of the time fixed by the court for filing of objections, 'the court shall discharge the bankrupt if no objection has been filed and if the filing fees required to be paid by this title have been paid in full.' Section 14(c), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 32(c), similarly provides that the court 'shall grant the discharge unless satisfied that the bankrupt . . . (8) has failed to pay the filing fees required to be paid by this title in full.' Section 59(g), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 95(g), relates to the dismissal of a petition in bankruptcy and states that 'in the case of a dismissal for failure to pay the costs,' notice to creditors shall not be required. Three separate sections of the Act thus contemplate the imposition of fees and condition a discharge upon payment of those fees.\n\n\n4\nThree charges are imposed: $37 for the referee's salary and expense fund, $10 for compensation of the trustee,1 and $3 for the clerk's services. \u00a7\u00a7 40(c) (1), 48(c), and 52(a), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 68(c)(1), 76(c), and 80(a). These total $50.2 The fees are payable upon the filing of the petition. Section 40(c) (1), however, contains a proviso that in cases of voluntary bankruptcy, all the fees 'may be paid in installments, if so authorized by General Order of the Supreme Court of the United States.'\n\n\n5\nThe Court's General Order in Bankruptcy No. 35(4), as amended June 23, 1947, 331 U.S. 873, 876\u2014877, 11 U.S.C.App., p. 2210, complements \u00a7 40(c)(1) and provides that, upon a proper showing by the bankrupt, the fees may be paid in installments within a six-month period, which may be extended not to exceed three months.3\n\nII\n\n6\nRobert William Kras presented his voluntary petition in bankruptcy to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on May 28, 1971. The petition was accompanied by Kras' motion for leave to file and proceed in bankruptcy without payment of any of the filing fees as a condition precedent to discharge. The motion was supported by Kras' affidavit containing the following allegations that have not been controverted by the Government:\n\n\n7\n1. Kras resides in a 2 1\/2-room apartment with his wife, two children, ages 5 years and 8 months, his mother, and his mother's 6-year-old dauthter. His younger child suffers from cystic fibrosis and is undergoing treatment in a medical center.\n\n\n8\n2. Kras has been unemployed since May 1969 except for odd jobs producing about $300 in 1969 and a like amount in 1970. His last steady job was as an insurance agent with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. He was discharged by Metropolitan in 1969 when premiums he had collected were stolen from his home and he was unable to make up the amount to his employer. Metropolitan's claim against him has increased to over $1,000 and is one of the debts listed in his bankruptcy petition. He has diligently sought steady employment in New York City, but, because of unfavorable references from Metropolitan, he has been unsuccessful. Mrs. Kras was employed until March 1970, when she was forced to stop because of pregnancy. All her attention now will be devoted to caring for the younger child who is coming out of the hospital soon.\n\n\n9\n3. The Kras household subsists entirely on $210 per month public assistance received for Kras' own family and $156 per month public assistance received for his mother and her daughter. These benefis are all expended for rent and day-to-day necessities. The rent is $102 per month. Kras owns no automobile and no asset that is non-exempt under the bankruptcy law. He receives no unemployment or disability benefit. His sole assets are wearing apparel and $50 worth of essential houselhold goods that are exempt under \u00a7 6 of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 24, and under New York Civil Practice Laws and Rules \u00a7 5205 (1963). He has a couch of negligible value in storage on which a $6 payment is due monthly.\n\n\n10\n4. Because of his poverty, Kras is wholly unable to pay or promise to pay the bankruptcy fees, even in small installments. He has been unable to borrow money. The New York City Department of Social Services refuses to allot money for payment of the fees. He has no prospect of immediate employment.\n\n\n11\n5. Kras seeks a discharge in bankruptcy of $6,428.69 in total indebtedness in order to relieve himself and his family of the distress of financial insolvency and creditor harassment and in order to make a new start in life. It is especially important that he obtain a discharge of his debt to Metropolitan soon 'because until that is cleared up Metropolitan will continue to falsely charge me with fraud and give me bad references which prevent my getting employment.'\n\n\n12\nThe District Court's opinion contains an order, 331 F.Supp., at 1215, granting Kras' motion for leave to file his petition in bankruptcy without prepayment of fees. He was adjudged a bankrupt on September 13, 1971. Later, the referee, upon consent of the parties, entered an order allowing Kras to conduct all necessary proceedings in bankruptcy up to but not including discharge. The referee stayed the discharge pending disposition of this appeal.\n\nIII\n\n13\nIn the District Court Kras first presented a statutory argument\u2014and, alternatively, one based in common law\u2014that he was entitled to relief from payment of the bankruptcy charges because of the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a).4 This is the in forma pauperis statute that has its origin in the Act of July 20, 1892, c. 209, 27 Stat. 252. See also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 832\u2014836 (1940 ed.).\n\n\n14\nThe District Court rejected the argument despite the seeming facial application of \u00a7 1915(a) to a bankruptcy proceeding as well as to any other. It reached this result by noting that \u00a7 51(2) of the Bankruptcy Act, as originally adopted in 1898, 30 Stat. 558, had provided for a waiver of fees upon the filing of an affidavit of inability to pay; that by the passage of the Referees' Salary Bill in 1946, 60 Stat. 326, bankruptcy petitions in forma pauperis were abolished, H.R.Rep. No. 1037, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 6 (1945); S.Rep. No. 959, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 7 (1946); and that the 1946 statute, being later and having a positive and specific provision for postponement of fees in cases of indigency, overrode the earlier general provisions of \u00a7 1915(a). 331 F.Supp., at 1209 s1210. To the same effect are In re Garland, 428 F.2d, at 1186\u20141187, and In re Smith, 323 F.Supp. 1082, 1084\u20141085 (Colo.1971), the reasoning of which the District Court adopted. So also is In re Smith, 341 F.Supp. 1297, 1298 (ND Ill.1972).\n\n\n15\nThe appellee may well have abandoned the argument on this appeal. Tr. of Oral Arg. 44\u201445. In any event, we agree, for the reasons stated by the District Court and by the courts in Garland and in the two Smith cases, supra, that \u00a7 1915(a) is not now available in bankruptcy. See 2 W. Collier, Bankruptcy 51.01, pp. 1873\u20141874 (14th ed. 1971). Neither do we perceive any common-law right to proceed without payment of fees. Congress, of course, sometime might conclude that \u00a7 1915(a) should be made applicable to bankruptcy and legislate accordingly.\n\n\n16\nThe District Court went on to hold, however, 331 F.Supp., at 1210\u20141215, that the prescribed fees, payment of which was required as a condition precedent to discharge, served to deny Kras 'his Fifth Amendment right of due process, including equal protection.' Id., at 1212. It held that a discharge in bankruptcy was a 'fundamental interest' that could be denied only when a 'compelling government interest' was demonstrated. It noted, id., at 1213, that provision should be made by the referee for the survival, beyond bankruptcy, of the bankrupt's obligation to pay the fees. The court rested its decision primarily upon Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 91 S.Ct. 780, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971), which came down after the First Circuit's decision in Garland, supra. A number of other district courts and bankruptcy referees have reached the same result.5\n\n\n17\nKras contends that his case falls squarely within Boddie. The Government, on the other hand, stresses the differences between divorce (with which Boddie was concerned) and bankruptcy, and claims that Boddie is not controlling and that the fee requirements constitute a reasonable exercise of Congress' plenary power over bankruptcy.\n\nIV\n\n18\nBoddie was a challenge by welfare recipients to certain Connecticut procedures, including the payment of court fees and costs, that allegedly restricted their access to the courts for divorce. The plaintiffs, simply by reason of their indigency, were unable to bring their actions. The Court reversed a district court judgment that a State could limit access to its courts by fees 'which effectively bar persons on relief from commencing actions therein.' 286 F.Supp. 986, 972. Mr. Justice Harlan, writing for the Court, stressed state monopolization of the means for legally dissolving marriage and identified the would-be indigent divorce plaintiff with any other action's impoverished defendant forced into court by the institution of a lawsuit against him. He declared that 'a meaningful opportunity to be heard' was firmly imbedded in our due process jurisprudence, 401 U.S., at 377, 91 S.Ct., at 785, and that this was to be protected against denial by laws that operate to jeopardize it for particular individuals, id., at 379\u2014380, 91 S.Ct., at 786\u2014787. The Court then concluded that Connecticut's refusal to admit these good-faith divorce plaintiffs to its courts equated with the denial of an opportunity to be heard and, in the absence of a sufficient countervailing justification for the State's action, a denial of due process, id., at 380\u2014381, 91 S.Ct., at 787\n\n\n19\nBut the Court emphasized that 'we go no further than necessary to dispose of the case before us.' Id., at 382, 91 S.Ct., at 788.\n\n\n20\n'We do not decide that access for all individuals to the      courts is a right that is, in all circumstances, guaranteed      by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment so that      its exercise may not be placed beyond the reach of any      individual, for, as we have already noted, in the case before      us this right is the exclusive precondition to the adjustment      of a fundamental human relationship. The requirement that      these appellants resort to the judicial process is entirely a      state-created matter. Thus we hold only that a State may not,      consistent with the obligations imposed on it by the Due      Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, pre-empt the      right to dissolve this legal relationship without affording      all citizens access to the means it has prescribed for doing      so.' Id., at 382\u2014383, 91 S.Ct., at 788\u2014789.\n\n\n21\nMr. Justice Douglas, concurring in the result, rested his conclusion on equal protection rather than due process. 'I do not see the length of the road we must follow if we accept my Brother Harlan's invitation.' Id., at 383, 385, 91 S.Ct., at 790. Mr. Justice Brennan concurred in part, for he discerned no distinction between divorce and 'any other right arising under federal or state law' and he, also, found a denial of equal protection. Id., at 386, 387, 91 S.Ct., at 791. Mr. Justice Black dissented, id., at 389, 91 S.Ct., at 792, feeling that the Connecticut court costs were barred by neither the Due Process Clause nor the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n22\nJust two months after Boddie was decided, the Court denied certiorari in Garland. 402 U.S. 966, 91 S.Ct. 1624, 29 L.Ed.2d 130. Mr. Justice Brennan was of the opinion that certiorari should have been granted. Mr. Justice Black, in an opinion applicable to Garland and to seven other then-pending cases, 402 U.S. 954, 91 S.Ct. 1624, 29 L.Ed. 124, dissented and would have heard argument in all eight cases 'or reverse them outright on the basis of the decision in Boddie.' Id., at 955, 91 S.Ct., at 1625. For him 'the need . . . to file for a discharge in bankruptcy seem(ed) . . . more 'fundamental' than a person's right to seek a divorce.' Id., at 958, 91 S.Ct., at 1626. And Mr. Justice Douglas similarly dissented from the denial of certiorari in Garland and in four other cases because 'obtaining a fresh start in life through bankruptcy proceedings . . . (seemingly come(s) within) the Equal Protection Clause.' 402 U.S. 960, 961, 91 S.Ct. 1627.\n\n\n23\nThus, although a denial of certiorari normally carries no implication or inference, Chessman v. Teets, 354 U.S. 156, 164 n. 13, 77 S.Ct. 1127, 1131, 1 L.Ed.2d 1253 (1957); Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953), the pointed dissents of Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Douglas to the denial in Garland so soon after Boddie, and Mr. Justice Harlan's failure to join the dissenters, surely are not without some significance as to their and the Court's attitude about the application of the Boddie principle to bankruptcy fees.\n\nV\n\n24\nWe agree with the Government that our decision in Boddie does not control the disposition of this case and that the District Court's reliance upon Boddie is misplaced.\n\n\n25\nA. Boddie was based on the notion that a State cannot deny access, simply because of one's poverty, to a 'judicial proceeding (that is) the only effective means of resolving the dispute at hand.' 401 U.S., at 376, 91 S.Ct., at 785. Throughout the opinion there is constant and recurring reference to Connecicut's exclusive control over the establishment, enforcement, and dissolution of the marital relationship. The Court emphasized that 'marriage involves interests of basic importance in our society,' ibid., and spoke of 'state monopolization of the means for legally dissolving this relationship,' id., at 374, 91 S.Ct., at 784. '(R)esort to the state courts (was) the only avenue to dissolution of . . . marriages,' id., at 376, 91 S.Ct., at 785, which was 'not only the paramount dispute-settlement technique, but, in fact, the only available one,' id., at 377, 91 S.Ct., at 785. The Court achknowledged that it knew 'of no instance where two consenting adults may divorce and mutually liberate themselves from the constraints of legal obligations that go with marriage, and more fundamentally the prohibition against remarriage, without invoking the State's judicial machinery,' id., at 376, 91 S.Ct., at 785. In the light of all this, we concluded that resort to the judicial process was 'no more voluntary in a realistic sense than that of the defendant called upon to defend his interests in court' and we resolved the case 'in light of the principles enunciated in our due process decisions that delimit rights of defendants compelled to litigate their differences in the judicial forum,' id., at 376 377, 91 S.Ct., at 785.\n\n\n26\nB. The appellants in Boddie, on the one hand, and Robert Kras, on the other, stand in materially different postures. The denial of access to the judicial forum in Boddie touched directly, as has been noted, on the marital relationship and on the associational interests that surround the establishment and dissolution of that relationship. On many occasions we have recognized the fundamental importance of these interests under our Constitution. See, for example, Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967); Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942); Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923). The Boddie appellants' inability to dissolve their marriages seriously impaired their freedom to pursue other protected associational activities. Kras' alleged interest in the elimination of his debt burden, and in obtaining his desired new start in life, although important and so recognized by the enactment of the Bankruptcy Act, does not rise to the same constitutional level. See Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970); Richardson v. Belcher, 404 U.S. 78, 92 S.Ct. 254, 30 L.Ed.2d 231 (1971). If Kras is not discharged in bankruptcy, his position will not be materially altered in any constitutional sense. Gaining or not gaining a discharge will effect no change with respect to basic necessities.6 We see no fundamental interest that is gained or lost depending on the availability of a discharge in bankruptcy.\n\n\n27\nC. Nor is the Government's control over the establishment, enforcement, or dissolution of debts nearly so exclusive as Connecticut's control over the marriage relationship in Boddie. In contrast with divorce, bankruptcy is not the only method available to a debtor for the adjustment of his legal relationship with his creditors. The utter exclusiveness of court access and court remedy, as has been noted, was a potent factor in Boddie. But '(w)ithout a prior judicial imprimatur, individuals may freely enter into and rescind commercial contracts . . ..' 401 U.S., at 376, 91 S.Ct., at 785.\n\n\n28\nHowever unrealistic the remedy may be in a particular situation, a debtor, in theory, and often in actuality, may adjust his debts by negotiated agreement with his creditors. At times the happy passage of the applicable limitation period, or other acceptable creditor arrangement, will provide the answer. Government's role with respect to the private commercial relationship is qualitatively and quantitatively different from its role in the establishment, enforcement, and dissolution of marriage.\n\n\n29\nResort to the court, therefore, is not Kras' sole path to relief. Boddie's emphasis on exclusivity finds no counterpart in the bankupt's situation. See Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 547\u2014555, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1226\u20141229, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949).\n\n\n30\nD. We are also of the opinion that the filing fee requirement does not deny Kras the equal protection of the laws. Bankruptcy is hardly akin to free speech or marriage or to those other rights, so many of which are imbedded in the First Amendment, that the Court has come to regard as fundamental and that demand the lofty requirement of a compelling governmental interest before they may be significantly regulated. See Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 638, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 1333, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969). Neither does it touch upon what have been said to be the suspect criteria of race, nationality, or alienage. Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 375, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 1853, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971). Instead, bankruptcy legislation is in the area of economics and social welfare. See Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S., at 484\u2014485, 90 S.Ct., at 1161; Richardson v. Belcher, 404 U.S., at 81, 92 S.Ct., at 256; Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56, 74, 92 S.Ct. 862, 874, 31 L.Ed.2d 36 (1972); Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U.S. 535, 546, 92 S.Ct. 1724, 1731, 32 L.Ed.2d 285 (1972). This being so, the applicable standard, in measuring the propriety of Congress' classification, is that of rational justification. Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 611\u2014612, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 1372\u20141373, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (1960); Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S., at 485\u2014486, 90 S.Ct., at 1161, 1162; Richardson v. Belcher, 404 U.S., at 81, 92 S.Ct., at 256.\n\n\n31\nE. There is no constitutional right to obtain a discharge of one's debts in bankruptcy. The Constitution, Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 4, merely authorizes the Congress to 'establish . . . uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.' Although the first bankruptcy law in England was enacted in 1542, 34 & 35 Hen. 8, c. 4, and a discharge provision first appeared in 1705, 4 Anne, c. 17, primarily as a reward for cooperating debtors, J. MacLachlan, Bankruptcy 20\u201421 (1956), voluntary bankruptcy was not known in this country at the adoption of the Constitution. Indeed, for the entire period prior to the present Act of 1898, the Nation was without a federal bankruptcy law except for three short periods aggregating about 15 1\/2 years. The first statute was the Act of April 4, 1800, c. 19, 2 Stat. 19, and it was repealed by the Act of December 19, 1803, c. 6, 2 Stat. 248. The second was the Act of August 19, 1841, c. 9, 5 Stat. 440, repealed less than two years later by the Act of March 3, 1843, c. 82, 5 Stat. 614. The third was the Act of March 2, 1867, c. 176, 14 Stat. 517; it was repealed by the Act of June 7, 1878, c. 160, 20 Stat. 99. Voluntary petitions were permitted under the 1841 and 1867 Acts. See 1 W. Collier, Bankruptcy 0.03\u20140.05, pp. 6\u20149 (14th ed. 1971). Professor MacLachlan has said that the development of the discharge 'represents an independent . . . public policy in favor of extricating an insolvent debtor from what would otherwise be a financial impasse.' J. MacLachlan, Bankruptcy 88 (footnote omitted). But this obviously is a legislatively created benefit, not a constitutional one, and, as noted, it was a benefit withheld, save for three short periods, during the first 110 years of the Nation's life. The mere fact that Congress has delegated to the District Court supervision over the proceedings by which a petition for discharge is processed does not convert a statutory benefit into a constitutional right of access to a court. Then, too, Congress might have delegated the responsibility to an administrative agency.\n\n\n32\nF. The rational basis for the fee requirement is readily apparent. Congressional power over bankruptcy, of course, is plenary and exclusive. Kalb v. Feuerstein, 308 U.S. 433, 438\u2014439, 60 S.Ct. 343, 345\u2014346, 84 L.Ed. 370 (1940). By the 1946 Amendment, 60 Stat. 326, Congress, as has been noted, abolished the theretofore existing practices of the pauper petition and of compensating the referee from the fees he collected. It replaced that system with one for salaried referees and for fixed fees for every petition filed and a specified percentage of distributable assets. It sought to make the system self-sustaining and paid for by those who use it rather than by tax revenues drawn from the public at large. H.R.Rep. No. 1037, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 4\u20146 (1945); S.Rep. No. 959, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 2, 5\u20146 (1946).7 The propriety of the requirement that the fees be paid ultimately has been recognized even by those district courts that have held the payment of the fee as a precondition to a discharge to be unconstitutional, for those courts would make the payments survive the bankruptcy as a continuing obligation of the bankrupt. In re Smith, 323 F.Supp., at 1093; In re Ottman, 336 F.Supp. 746, 748 (E.D.Wis.1972); see O'Brien v. Trevethan, 336 F.Supp. 1029, 1034 (Conn.1972).\n\n\n33\nFurther, the reasonableness of the structure Congress produced, and congressional concern for the debtor, are apparent from the provisions permitting the debtor to file his petition without payment of any fee, with consequent freedom of subsequent earnings and of after-acquired assets (with the rare exception specified in \u00a7 70(a) of the Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(a)) from the claims of then-existing obligations. These provisions, coupled with the bankrupt's ability to obtain a stay of all debt enforcement actions pending at the filing of the petition or thereafter commenced, \u00a7\u00a7 11(a) and 2(a)(15), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 29(a) and 11(a)(15); 1A W. Collier, Bankruptcy 11.03 (14th ed. 1972); 1 id., 2.62(4) (14th ed. 1971), enable a bankrupt to terminate his harassment by creditors, to protect his future earnings and property, and to have his new start with a minimum of effort and financial obligation. They serve also, as an incidental effect, to promote and not to defeat the purpose of making the bankruptcy system financially self-sufficient. Cf. Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S., at 74\u201479, 92 S.Ct., at 874\u2014877.\n\n\n34\nG. If the $50 filing fees are paid in installments over six months as General Order No. 35(4) permits on a proper showing, the required average weekly payment is $1.92. If the payment period is extended for the additional three months as the Order permits, the average weekly payment is lowered to $1.28.8 This is a sum less than the payments Kras makes on his couch of negligible value in storage, and less than the price of a movie and little more than the cost of a pack or two of cigarettes. If, as Kras alleges in his affidavit, a discharge in bankruptcy will afford him that new start he so desires, and the Metropolitan then no longer will charge him with fraud and give him bad references,9 and if he really needs and desires that discharge, this much available revenue should be within his able-bodied reach when the adjudication in bankruptcy has stayed collection and has brought to a halt whatever harassment, if any, he may have sustained from creditors.\n\nVI\n\n35\nMr. Justice Harlan, in his opinion for the Court in Boddie, meticulously pointed out, as we have noted above, that the Court went 'no further than necessary to dispose of the case before us' and did 'not decide that access for all individuals to the courts is a right that is, in all circumstances, guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment so that its exercise may not be placed beyond the reach of any individual.' 401 U.S., at 382\u2014383, 91 S.Ct., at 788. The Court obviously stopped short of an unlimited rule that an indigent at all times and in all cases has the right to relief without the payment of fees.\n\n\n36\nWe decline to extend the principle of Boddie to the no-asset bankruptcy proceeding. That relief, if it is to be forthcoming, should originate with Congress. See Shaeffer, Proceedings in Bankruptcy In Forma Pauperis, 69 Col.L.Rev. 1203 (1969).\n\n\n37\nReversed.\n\n\n38\nMr. Cheif Justice BURGER, concurring.\n\n\n39\nI concur fully in the Court's opinion. The painstaking and precise delineation by Mr. Justice Harlan of the interests involved in Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 91 S.Ct. 780, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971), ought not to be ignored as the dissenting opinions would do. Moreover, the exclusivity of a State's control of marriage and divorce is a far cry from the degree of government control over relations between debtor and creditor, as Mr. Justice BLACKMUN has pointed out. In a bankruptcy proceeding the government, through the court, is no more than the overseer and the administrator of the process; it is not the absolute and exclusive controller as with the dissolution of marriage. Like the descent and distribution of property for which all States have provided statutes and probate courts, the bankruptcy court is but one mode of orderly adjustment with creditors; it is not the only one since many debtors work out binding private adjustments with creditors.\n\n\n40\nSurely there are strong arguments, as a matter of policy, for the result the dissenting view asserts. But Congress has not yet seen fit to declare the policy that the dissenters now find in the Constitution. In 1970 Congress authorized a tripartite commission to review the bankruptcy laws.1 The commission has been engaged in its task for more than two years and it is hardly likely that this problem will escape its consideration.2 The Constitution is not the exclusive source of law reform, even needed reform, in our system.\n\n\n41\nMr. Justice STEWART, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, Mr. Justice BRENNAN, and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting.\n\n\n42\nOn May 28, 1971, Robert Kras, the appellee, sought to file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. In an accompanying affidavit, he described his economic plight. He resided in a 2 1\/2-room apartment with his wife, his two young children, his mother, and her child. His eight-month-old son had cystic fibrosis and at the time of the\n\n\n\n1\n Pub.L. 91\u2014354, 84 Stat. 468.\n\n\n2\n The commission's mandate requires it to 'study, analyze, evaluate, and recommend changes' in the Bankruptcy Act 'in order for such Act to reflect and adequately meet the demands of present technical, financial, and commercial activities. The commission's study . . . shall include a consideration of the basic philosophy of bankruptcy, the causes of bankruptcy, the possible alternatives to the present system of bankruptcy administration, the applicability of advanced management techniques to achieve economies in the administration of the Act, and all other matters which the Commission shall deem relevant.' Of particular relevance is the preamble to the Act creating the commission, which recites in part that 'the technical aspects of the Bankruptcy Act are interwoven with the rapid expansion of credit which has reached proportions far beyond anything previously experienced by the citizens of the United States.'\n\n\n\n43\nThe report of the commission is to be submitted prior to June 30, 1973. Pub.L. 92\u2014251, 86 Stat. 63. affidavit was undergoing hospital treatment. Unemployed since May 1969, except for odd jobs, he supported his household on a total public assistance allotment of $366 per month\u2014all of which was consumed on rent and the most basic necessities of life. His sole assets consisted of $50 worth of clothing and essential household goods.1\n\n\n44\nHe sought a discharge from over $6,000 in debts, particularly his indebtedness to a former employer that he contended hampered his present efforts to find a permanent job: 'I earnestly seek a discharge in bankruptcy . . . in order to relieve myself and my family of the distress of financial insolvency and creditor harassment and in order to make a new start in life. . . . When I do get a job I want to be able to spend my wages for the support of myself and my family and for the medical care of my son, instead of paying them to my creditors and forcing my family to remain dependent on welfare.'\n\n\n45\nHe indicated that he was unable to pay the $50 bankruptcy filing fee in a lump sum,2 and could not promise to pay it in installments, as required before the petition could be filed.3 He contended that the fee requirement was unconstitutional as applied to him,4 and moved for leave to proceed without paying the fee.\n\n\n46\nThe District Court held that under the doctrine of Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 91 S.Ct. 780, 28 L.Ed.2d 113, the statutory requirement of a prepaid bankruptcy filing fee would violate Kras' Fifth Amendment right to due process of law. 331 F.Supp. 1207, 1212.5 The court ordered the petition filed and directed the referee in bankruptcy to make provision for the survival of the appellee's obligation to pay the filing fee. We noted probable jurisdiction of the Government's appeal. 405 U.S. 915, 92 S.Ct. 955, 30 L.Ed.2d 130. I agree with the District Court and would, therefore, affirm its judgment.\n\n\n47\nBoddie held that a Connecticut statute requiring the payment of an average $60 fee as a prerequisite to a divorce action was unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as applied to indigents unable to pay the fee. The Court reasoned that due process protections are traditionally viewed as safeguards for a defendant, because at the point when a plaintiff invokes the governmental power of a court, the judicial proceeding is 'the only effective means of resolving the dispute at hand and denial of a defendant's full access to that process raises grave problems for its legitimacy.' 401 U.S., at 376, 91 S.Ct., at 785. But a party to a marriage remains under serious and continuing obligation imposed by the State, which cannot be removed except by judicial dissolution of the marital bond. Thus, we concluded that:\n\n\n48\n'(A)lthough they assert here due process rights as would-be      plaintiffs, we think appellants' plight, because resort to      the state courts is the only avenue to dissolution of their      marriages, is akin to that of defendants faced with exclusion      from the only forum effectively empowered to settle their      disputes. Resort to the judicial process by these plaintiffs      is no more voluntary in a realistic sense than that of the      defendants called upon to defend his interests in court. For      both groups this process is not only the paramount      dispute-settlement technique, but, in fact, the only      available one.' Id., at 376\u2014377, 91 S.Ct., at 785.\n\n\n49\nThe violation of due process seems to me equally clear in the present case. It is undisputed that Kras is making a good-faith attempt to obtain a discharge in bankruptcy, and that he is in fact indigent. As was true in Boddie, the 'welfare income . . . barely suffices to meet the costs of the daily essentials of life and includes no allotment that could be budgeted for the expense to gain access to the courts . . ..' Id., at 372\u2014373, 91 S.Ct., at 783.6\n\n\n50\nSimilarly, the debtor, like the married plaintiffs in Biddie, originally entered into his contract freely and voluntarily. But it is the Government nevertheless that continues to enforce that obligation, and under our 'legal system' that debt is effective only because the judicial machinery is there to collect it. The bankrupt is bankrupt precisely for the reason that the State stands ready to exact all of his debts through garnishment, attachment, and the panoply of other creditor remedies. The appellee can be pursued and harassed by his creditors since they hold his legally enforceable debts.\n\n\n51\nAnd in the unique situation of the indigent bankrupt, the Government provides the only effective means of his ever being free of these Government-imposed obligations. As in Boddie, there are no 'recognized, effective alternatives,' id., at 376, 91 S.Ct., at 785. While the creditors of a bankrupt with assets might well desire to reach a compromise settlement, that possibility is foreclosed to the truly indigent bankrupt. With no funds and not even a sufficient prospect of income to be able to promise the payment of a $50 fee in weekly installments of $1.28, the assetless bankrupt has absolutely nothing to offer his creditors. And his creditors have nothing to gain by allowing him to escape or reduce his debts; their only hope is that eventually he might make enough income for them to attach. Unless the Government provides him access to the bankruptcy court, Kras will remain in the totally hopeless situation he now finds himself. The Government has thus truly pre-empted the only means for the indigent bankrupt to get out from under a lifetime burden of debt.7\n\n\n52\nThe Government contends that the filing fee is justified by the congressional decision to make the bankruptcy system self-supporting.8 But in Boddie we rejected this same 'pay as you go' argument, finding it an insufficient justification for excluding the poor from the only available process to dissolve a marriage. 401 U.S., at 382, 91 S.Ct., at 788. The argument is no more persuasive here. The Constitution cannot tolerate achievement of the goal of self-support for a bankruptcy system, any more than for a domestic relations court, at the price of denying due process of law to the poor. In re Naron, 334 F.Supp. 1150, 1151; In re Smith, 323 F.Supp. 1082, 1088.9\n\n\n53\nIn my view, this case, like Boddie, does not require us to decide 'that access for all individuals to the courts is a right that is, in all circumstances, guaranteed by the Due Process Clause . . . so that its exercise may not be placed beyond the reach of any individual . . ..' 401 U.S., at 382\u2014383, 91 S.Ct., at 788. It is sufficient to hold, as Boddie did, that 'a State may not, consistent with the obligations imposed on it by the Due Process Clause . . ., pre-empt the right to dissolve this legal relationship without affording all citizens access to the means it has prescribed for doing so.' Id., at 383, 91 S.Ct., at 789.\n\n\n54\nThe Bankruptcy Act relieves 'the honest debtor from the weight of oppressive indebtedness, and (permits) him to start afresh free from the obligations and responsibilities consequent upon business misfortunes,' Williams v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 236 U.S. 549, 554\u2014555, 35 S.Ct. 289, 290, 59 L.Ed. 713. It holds out a promise to the debtor of 'a new opportunity in life and a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of pre-existing debt.' Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, 292 U.S. 234, 244, 54 S.Ct. 695, 699, 78 L.Ed. 1230. Yet the Court today denies that promise to those who need it most, to those who every day must live face-to-face with abject poverty\u2014who cannot spare even $1.28 a week.\n\n\n55\nThe Court today holds that Congress may say that some of the poor are too poor even to go bankrupt. I cannot agree.\n\n\n56\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice BRENNAN, dissenting.\n\n\n57\nWhile we join Mr. Justice STEWART'S dissenting opinion we do so with this explicit statement of reasons. We said in Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499, 74 S.Ct. 693, 694, 98 L.Ed. 884, when holding that segregation of students in the District of Columbia violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment:\n\n\n58\n'The Fifth Amendment, which is applicable in the District of      Columbia, does not contain an equal protection clause as does      the Fourteenth Amendment which applies only to the states.      But the concepts of equal protection and due process, both      stemming from our American ideal of fairness, are not      mutually exclusive. The 'equal protection of the laws' is a      more explicit safeguard of prohibited unfairness than 'due      process of law,' and, therefore, we do not imply that the two      are always interchangeable phrases. But, as this Court has      recognized, discrimination may be so unjustifiable as to be      violative of due process.'\n\n\n59\nThe invidious discrimination in the present case is a denial of due process because it denies equal protection within our decisions which make particularly 'invidious' discrimination based on wealth or race.\n\n\n60\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, dissenting.\n\n\n61\nThe dissent of Mr. Justice STEWART, in which I have joined, makes clear the majority's failure to distinguish this case from Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 91 S.Ct. 780, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971). I add only some comments on the extraordinary route by which the majority reaches its conclusion.\n\n\n62\nA. The majority notes that the minimum amount that appellee Kras must pay each week if he is permitted to pay the filing fees in installments is only $1.28. It says that 'this much available revenue should be within his able-bodied reach.' Ante, at 449.\n\n\n63\nAppellee submitted an affidavit in which he claimed that he was 'unable to pay or promise to pay the filing fees, even in small installments.' App. 5. This claim was supported by detailed statements of his financial condition. The affidavit was unchallenged below, but the majority does challenge it. The District Judge properly accepted the factual allegations as true. See e.g., Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, 368 U.S. 464, 82 S.Ct. 486, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1962); First National Bank of Arizona v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S. 253, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968); 35B C.J.S. Federal Civil Procedure \u00a7 1197 n. 4 (1960). The majority seems to believe that it is not restrained by the traditional notion that judges must accept unchallenged, credible affidavits as true, for it disregards the factual allegations and the inferences that necessarily follow from them. I cannot treat that notion so cavalierly.1\n\n\n64\nEven if Kras' statement that he was unable to pay the fees was an honest mistake, surely he cannot have been mistaken in saying that he could not promise to pay the fees. The majority does not directly impugn his good faith in making that statement. Yet if he cannot promise to pay the fees, he cannot get the interim relief from creditor harassment that, the majority says, may enable him to pay the fees.\n\n\n65\nBut beyond all this, I cannot agree with the majority that it is so easy for the desperately poor to save $1.92 each week over the course of six months. The 1970 Census found that over 800,000 families in the Nation had annual incomes of less than $1,000 or $19.23 a week. U.S. Bureau of Census, Current Population Reports, series P\u201460, No. 80; U.S. Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States 1972, p. 323. I see no reason to require that families in such straits sacrifice over 5% of their annual income as a prerequisite to getting a discharge in bankruptcy.2\n\n\n66\nIt may be easy for some people to think that weekly savings of less than $2 are no burden. But no one who has had close contact with poor people can fail to understand how close to the margin of survival many of them are. A sudden illness, for example, may destroy whatever savings they may have accumulated, and by eliminating a sense of security may destroy the incentive to save in the future. A pack or two of cigarettes may be, for them, not a routine purchase but a luxury indulged in only rarely. The desperately poor almost never go to see a movie, which the majority seems to believe is an almost weekly activity. They have more important things to do with what little money they have\u2014like attempting to provide some comforts for a gravely ill child, as Kras must do.\n\n\n67\nIt is perfectly proper for judges to disagree about what the Constitution requires. But it is disgraceful for an interpretation of the Constitution to be premised upon unfounded assumptions about how people live.\n\n\n68\nB. The majority derives some solace from the denial of certiorari in In re Garland, 402 U.S. 966, 91 S.Ct. 1624, 29 L.Ed.2d 130 (1971). Reliance on denial of certiorari for any proposition impairs the vitality of the discretion we exercise in controlling the cases we hear. See Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 491\u2014492, 73 S.Ct. 397, 438 439, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.). For all that the legal community knows, Mr. Justice Harlan did not join the dissent from denial of certiorari in that case for reasons different from those that the majority uses to distinguish this case from Boddie. Perhaps he believed that lower courts should have some time to consider the implications of Boddie. Most of the lower courts have refused to follow the First Circuit's decision in Garland, 428 F.2d 1185. See ante, at 453 n. 5 (STEWART, J., dissenting). Perhaps he thought that the record in that case made inappropriate any attempt to determine the scope of Boddie in that particular case. Or perhaps he had some other reason.\n\n\n69\nThe point of our use of a discretionary writ is precisely to prohibit that kind of speculation. When we deny dertiorari, no one, not even ourselves, should think that the denial indicates a view on the merits of the case. It ill serves judges of the courts throughout the country to tell them, as the majority does today, that in attempting to determine what the law is, they must read, not only the opinions of this Court, but also the thousands of cases in which we annually deny certiorari.3\n\n\n70\nC. The majority says that '(t)he denial of access to the judicial forum in Boddie touched directly . . . on the marital relationship.' It sees 'no fundamental interest that is gained or lost depending on the availability of a discharge in bankruptcy.' Ante, at 444, 445. If the case is to turn on distinctions between the role of courts in divorce cases and their role in bankruptcy cases,4 I agree with Mr. Justice STEWART that this case and Boddie cannot be distinguished; the role of the Government in standing ready to enforce an otherwise continuing obligation is the same.\n\n\n71\nHowever, I would go further than Mr. Justice STEWART. I view the case as involving the right of access to the courts, the opportunity to be heard when one claims a legal right, and not just the right to a discharge in bankruptcy.5 When a person raises a claim of right or entitlement under the laws, the only forum in our legal system empowered to determine that claim is a court. Kras, for example, claims that he has a right under the Bankruptcy Act to be free of any duty to pay his creditors. There is no way to determine whether he has such a right except by adjudicating his claim.6 Failure to do so denies him access to the courts.\n\n\n72\nThe legal system is, of course, not so pervasive as to preclude private resolution of disputes. But private settlements do not determine the validity of claims of right. Such questions can be authoritatively resolved only in courts. It is in that sense, I believe, that we should consider the emphasis in Boddie on the exclusiveness of the judicial forum\u2014and give Kras his day in court.\n\n\n\n1\n Additional compensation to the trustee in an appropriate case is allowable under \u00a7 48(c), 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 76(c), but these provisions have no application for a noasset or fully exempt estate.\n\n\n2\n General Order in Bankruptcy No. 15, 305 U.S. 687 (1939), 11 U.S.C.App., p. 2203, provides that a trustee need not be appointed in a no-asset case. When a trustee is not appointed, the aggregate fees are $40.\n\n\n3\n '(4) The petition in a voluntary proceeding under Chapters I to VII . . . of the Act may be accepted for filing by the clerk if accompanied by a verified petition of the bankrupt . . . stating that the petitioner is without and cannot obtain the money with which to pay the filing fees in full at the time of filing. Such petition shall state the facts showing the necessity for the payment of the filing fees in installments and shall set forth the terms upon which the peitioner proposes to pay the filing fees.\n'a. At the first meeting of creditors or any adjournment thereof, the court . . . shall enter an order fixing the amount and date of payment of such installments. The final installment shall be payable not more than six months after the date of filing of the original petition; provided, however, that for cause shown the court may extend the time of payment of any installment for a period not to exceed three months.\n'b. Upon the failure of a bankrupt . . . to pay any installment as ordered, the court may dismiss the proceeding for failure to pay costs as provided in Section 59, sub. g. of the Act. . . .\n'c. No proceedings upon the discharge of a babkrupt . . . shall be instituted until the filing fees are paid in full.'\n\n\n4\n 'Any court of the United States may authorize the commencement, prosecution or defense of any suit, action or proceeding, civil or criminal, or appeal therein, without prepayment of fees and costs or security therefor, by a person who makes affidavit that he is unable to pay such costs or give security therefor. Such affidavit shall state the nature of the action, defense or appeal and affiant's belief that he is entitled to redress.'\n\n\n5\n In re Smith, 323 F.Supp. 1082 (Colo.1971) (decided before Boddie); In re Naron, 334 F.Supp. 1150 (Or.1971); In re Ottman, 336 F.Supp. 746 (ED Wis.1972); In re Smith, 341 F.Supp. 1297 (ND Ill.1972); In re Haddock and Beeman, Nos. 14810 and 14811 (Conn.1972); In re Passwater, Nos. IP70\u2014B\u20143697 and IP70\u2014B\u20143698 (SD Ind.1971); In re Ripley, .no. Bk 71\u2014o\u20141003 (Neb.1972); In re Read, No. Bk 71\u2014826 (WDNY 1971). See O'Brien v. Trevethan, 336 F.Supp. 1029 (Conn.1972). But see In re Partilla, No. 71\u2014B\u2014380 (SDNY 1971); In re Malevich, No. Bk 29\u201471 (NJ 1971).\n\n\n6\n See N.Y. CPLR \u00a7 5205 (1963); N.Y. Labor Law \u00a7 595 (1965); N.Y. Social Welfare Law \u00a7 137 (1966), and \u00a7 137\u2014a (Supp.1972 1973).\n\n\n7\n For the decade ended June 30, 1959, the Referee's Salary and Expense Fund showed surpluses for the first five fiscal years and deficits for the last five. For fiscal 1969, 107,481 no-asset cases were terminated (as compared with 169,500 nonbusiness cases filed). Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Tables of Bankruptcy Statistics for Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1969, pp. 5, 10 (1971). This means, of course, that the fees were paid in those terminated no-asset cases. Undue hardship and denial of access to the courts are not apparent from this record of achievement.\n\n\n8\n If the fees total $40, as they may under General Order No. 15, 305 U.S. 687 (1939), 11 U.S.C.App., p. 2203, these average weekly figures are reduced to $1.54 and $1.03 respectively.\n\n\n9\n We fail to see how a discharge in bankruptcy in itself will prevent the Metropolitan from issuing an unfavorable reference letter about Kras.\n\n\n1\n These items are exempt from distribution in bankruptcy pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 and N.Y. CPLR \u00a7 5205 (1963).\n\n\n2\n The fee consists of $37 for the referees' salary and expense fund, $10 compensation for the trustees, and $3 to the clerk as a filing fee. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 68(c)(1), 76(c), 80(a).\n\n\n3\n This Court's General Order in Bankruptcy No. 35(4), authorized by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 68(c)(1), permits fees to be paid in installments over a six-month period, amounting to $1.92 a week; and, for cause, this period may be extended for an additional three months, so that the debtor would only be required to pay $1.28 per week. But before the bankruptcy petition can be filed, the petitioner must both indicate that he is without, and cannot obtain, money with which to pay the fee in advance, and set forth the terms upon which he proposes to make installment payments.\n\n\n4\n The appellee also contended that the filing fee should be waived under the general federal in forma pauperis statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a). That contention was rejected by the District Court on the grounds that, in 1946, Congress expressly eliminated bankruptcy petitions in forma pauperis, and substituted installment payments. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 68(c). In light of the clear congressional intent to eliminate pauper petitions, the court concluded, Congress did not intend to allow bankrupts to proceed under the general in forma pauperis statute. See also In re Garland, (1 Cir.) 428 F.2d 1185, 1186\u20141187; In re Smith, 323 F.Supp. 1082, 1084\u20141085. The appellee does not queston that conclusion here.\n\n\n5\n Other federal courts have reached the same conclusion. See In re Haddock, No. 14810 (Conn., May 22, 1972); In re Smith, 341 S.Supp. 1297; In re Ripley, No. Bk 71\u2014o\u20141003 (Neb., Apr. 28, 1972); In re Ottman, 336 F.Supp. 746; In re Naron, 334 F.Supp. 1150; In re Read, No. Bk 71\u2014826 (WDNY, Oct. 19, 1971). See also In re Shropshire (ND Ia., Mar. 28, 1972); In re Passwater, Nos. IP70 B\u20143697 and IP70\u2014B\u20143698 (SD Ind. 1971). But see In re Partilla, No. 71\u2014B\u2014380 (SDNY Oct. 15, 1971); In re Malevich, No. Bk 29\u201471 (NJ 1971). In re Garland, supra, upon which the Government relies, was decided before our decision in Boddie.\n\n\n6\n The appellee indicated in the affidavit submitted with his petition:\n'Because of my poverty, I am wholly unable to pay or promise to pay the filing fees, even in small installments, as a condition precedent to discharge and also provide myself and my dependents with day-to-day necessities. I have been unable to borrow money from my family, relatives, or friends. One of the debts of which I seek a discharge in bankruptcy is a loan from my wife's grandmother. The New York City Department of Social Services refuses to allot money for payment of the bankruptcy filing fees. I have no prospect of immediate employment.'\n\n\n7\n In Boddie, the Court recognized that marriage was a 'fundamental human relationship,' 401 U.S., at 383, 91 S.Ct., at 788, which involved interests 'of basic importance in our society.' Id., at 376, 91 S.Ct., at 785. But it was not any subjective conception of the 'fundamentality' of marriage, or divorce for that matter, that led the Court to find a due process violation in Boddie; rather, the significant factor about marriage was that '(w)ithout a prior judicial imprimatur, individuals may freely enter into and rescind commercial contracts, for example, but we are unaware of any jurisdiction where private citizens may covenant for or dissolve marriages without state approval.' Id., at 376, 91 S.Ct., at 785. It is the existence of judicially enforced obligations coupled with monopolization of the means of dissolution that similarly besets the indigent bankrupt.\n\n\n8\n Prior to 1946, while pauper petitioners were accepted without payment of fees, the referees whose compensation depended on fees, often demanded payment before granting a discharge. S.Rep.No.959, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 6\u20147 (1946); H.R.Rep.No.1037, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 6 (1945). The 1946 Amendments to the Bankruptcy Act eliminated pauper petitions and provided for the payment of fixed fees for every petition filed, and the payment of a fixed percentage of all distributable assets. See H.R.Rep.No.1037, supra, at 4, 5\u20146.\n\n\n9\n See Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 90 n. 22, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 1999, 32 L.Ed.2d 556; Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 540\u2014541, 91 S.Ct. 1586, 1589\u20141590, 29 L.Ed.2d 90; Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 261, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 1016, 25 L.Ed.2d 287; Cf. Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891.\nMoreover, there is no evidence that a substantial amount of revenue would be lost by allowing assetless indigents with no present prospects of paying the fee to file without prepayment. Any loss in fees that did result could be partly recouped by allowing the filing-fee debt to survive bankruptcy.\n\n\n1\n The majority also misrepresents appellee's financial condition. It says that $1.28 'is a sum less than the payments Kras makes on his couch of negligible value in storage.' Ante, at 449. Nowhere in the slender record of this case can I find any statement that appellee is actually paying anything for the storage of the couch. He said only that he 'owed payments of $6 per mouth' for storage. App. 5 (emphasis added). He also stated that he owed $6,428.69, but I would hardly read that to mean that he was paying that much to anyone.\n\n\n2\n The majority, in citing the 'record of achievement' of the bankruptcy system in terminating 107,481 no-asset cases in the fiscal year 1969, ante, at 448 n. 7, relies on spectral evidence. Because the filing fees bar relief through the bankruptcy system, statistics showing how many people got relief through that system are unenlightening on the question of how many people could not use the system because they were too poor. I do not know how many people cannot afford to pay a $50 fee in installments. But I find nothing in the majority's opinion to convince me that due process is afforded a person who cannot receive a discharge in bankruptcy because he is too poor. Even if only one person is affected by the filing fees, he is denied due process.\n\n\n3\n That one of us undertook to write a dissent, even a 'pointed dissent,' from the denial of certiorari should suggest, again, nothing at all about the views of any other Members of the Court on the merits of the petition. Surely each of us has seen many cases in which a colleague's dissent from the denial of certiorari pointed to an issue of great concern that we thought should be decided by this Court, but in which we did not join because we did not consider the case to be an appropriate vehicle for determination of that issue.\n\n\n4\n I am intrigued by the majority's suggestion that, because the granting of a divorce impinges on 'associational interests,' the right to a divorce is constitutionally protected. Are we to require that state divorce laws serve compelling state interests? For example, if a State chooses to allow divorces only when one party is shown to have committed adultery, must its refusal to allow them when the parties claim irreconcilable differences be justified by some compelling state interest? I raise these questions only to suggest that the majority's focus on the relative importance in the constitutional scheme of divorce and bankruptcy is misplaced. What is involved is the importance of access to the courts, either to remove an obligation that other branches of the government stand ready to enforce, as Mr. Justice STEWART sees it, or to determine claims of right, as I see it.\n\n\n5\n The majority suggests that no such right is involved, because Congress could have committed the administration of the Bankruptcy Act to a nonjudicial agency. Ante, at 447. I have some doubt about the proposition that a statutorily created right can be finally determined by an agency, with no method for a disappointed claimant to secure judicial review. But I have no doubt that Congress could not provide that only the well-off had the right to present their claims to the agency. As should be clear, the question is one of access to the forum empowered to determine the claim of right; it is only shorthand to call this a question of access to the courts.\n\n\n6\n It might be said that the right he claims does not come into play until he has fulfilled a condition precedent by paying the filing fees. But the distinction between procedure and substance is not unknown in the law and can be drawn on to counter that argument.\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"440 U.S. 173\n99 S.Ct. 983\n59 L.Ed.2d 230\nILLINOIS STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, Appellant,v.SOCIALIST WORKERS PARTY et al.\nNo. 77-1248.\nArgued Nov. 6, 1978.\nDecided Feb. 22, 1979.\n\n\nSyllabus\n\nUnder the Illinois Election Code, new political parties and independent candidates must obtain the signatures of 25,000 qualified voters in order to appear on the ballot in statewide elections.  However, the minimum number of signatures required in elections for offices of political subdivisions of the State is 5% of the number of persons who voted at the previous election for such offices.  Application of these provisions to a special mayoral election in Chicago produced the result that a new party or independent candidate needed substantially more signatures than would be needed for ballot access in a statewide election.  In actions by appellees, an independent candidate, two new political parties, and certain voters challenging this discrepancy on equal protection grounds, the District Court enjoined enforcement of the 5% provision insofar as it mandated more than 25,000 signatures, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Held:\n1. This Court's summary affirmance in Jackson v. Ogilvie, 403 U.S. 925, 91 S.Ct. 2247, 29 L.Ed.2d 705, of the District Court's decision in 325 F.Supp. 864, upholding Illinois' 5% signature requirement is not dispositive of the equal protection question presented here.  The precedential effect of a summary affirmance can extend no further than \"the precise issues presented and necessarily decided by those actions,\" Mandel v. Bradley, 432 U.S. 173, 176, 97 S.Ct. 2238, 2240, 53 L.Ed.2d 199. In contrast to this case, the challenge in Jackson involved only the discrepancy between the 5% requirement and the less stringent requirements for candidates of established political parties.  The issue presented here was not referred to by the Jackson District Court, and was mentioned only in passing in the jurisdictional statement subsequently filed with this Court.  Thus, the issue was not adequately presented to, or decided by, this Court in its summary affirmance.  Pp. 180-183.\n2. The Illinois Election Code, insofar as it requires independent candidates and new political parties to obtain more than 25,000 signatures in Chicago violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp. 183-187. (a) When such fundamental rights as the freedom to associate as a political party and the right to cast votes effectively are at stake, a State must establish that its regulation of ballot access is necessary to serve a compelling interest.  Pp. 184-185.\n(b) \"[E]ven when pursuing a legitimate interest, a State may not choose means that unnecessarily restrict constitutionally protected liberty,\" Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 59, 94 S.Ct. 303, 308, 38 L.Ed.2d 260, and States must adopt the least drastic means to achieve their ends.  This requirement is particularly important where restrictions on access to the ballot are involved. Since the State has determined that a smaller number of signatures in a larger political unit adequately serves its interest in regulating the number of candidates on the ballot, the signature requirements for independent candidates and political parties seeking offices in Chicago are clearly not the least restrictive means of achieving the same objective.  Appellant State Board of Elections has advanced no reason, much less a compelling one, why the State needs a more stringent requirement for elections in Chicago than for statewide elections.  Pp. 185-186.\n(c) Prior invalidation of Illinois' rules regarding geographic distribution of signatures tied the requirements for both city and state candidates solely to a population standard. However, while this may explain the anomaly at issue here, it does not justify it.  Historical accident, without more, cannot constitute a compelling state interest.  Pp. 186-187.\n3. The Court of Appeals properly dismissed as moot appellant's claim that the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners lacked authority to conclude a settlement agreement with respect to the unresolved issue whether the 5% signature requirement coupled with the filing deadline impermissibly burdened First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  Appellant has presented no evidence creating a reasonable expectation that the Chicago Board will repeat its purportedly unauthorized actions in subsequent elections.  Pp. 187-188.\n566 F.2d 586, affirmed.\nMichael L. Levinson, Springfield, Ill., for appellant.\nJeffrey D. Colman, Chicago, Ill., and Ronald Reosti, Detroit, Mich., for appellees.\nMr. Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nUnder the Illinois Election Code, new political parties and independent candidates must obtain the signatures of 25,000 qualified voters in order to appear on the ballot in statewide elections.1  However, a different standard applies in elections for offices of political subdivisions of the State.  The minimum number of signatures required for those elections is 5% of the number of persons who voted at the previous election for offices of the particular subdivision.2  In the city of Chicago, application of this standard has produced the incongruous result that a new party or an independent candidate needs substantially more signatures to gain access to the ballot than a similarly situated party or candidate for statewide office.3  The question before us is whether this discrepancy violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n2\n* In January 1977, the Chicago City Council ordered a special mayoral election to be held on June 7, 1977, to fill the vacancy created by the death of Mayor Richard J. Daley.  Pursuant to that order, the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners (Chicago Board) issued an election calendar that listed the filing dates and signature requirements applicable to independent candidates and new political parties.  Independent candidates had to obtain 35,947 valid signatures by February 19, and new political parties were required to file petitions with 63,373 valid signatures by April 4.4  Subsequently, the Chicago Board and the State Board of Elections (State Board) agreed for purposes of the special election to bring into conformity the requirements for independent candidates and new parties.  The filing deadline for independents was extended to April 4, and the signature requirement for new parties was reduced to 35,947.\n\n\n3\nBecause they had received less than 5% of the votes cast in the last mayoral election, the Socialist Workers Party and United States Labor Party were new political parties as defined in the Illinois statute.  See n. 1, supra.  Along with Gerald Rose, a candidate unaffiliated with any party, they were therefore subject to the signature requirements and filing deadlines specified in the election calendar.  On January 24, 1977, the Socialist Workers Party and two voters who supported its candidate for Mayor brought this action against the Chicago Board and the State Board to enjoin enforcement of the signature requirements and filing deadlines for new parties.5  One week later, Gerald Rose, the United States Labor Party, and four voters sued the Chicago Board, challenging the restrictions on new parties and independent candidates.  The State Board intervened as a defendant pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2403, and the District Court consolidated the two cases for trial.\n\n\n4\nPlaintiff-appellees contended at trial that the discrepancy between the requirements for state and city elections violated the Equal Protection Clause.  They argued further that the restrictions on independent candidates and new parties were unconstitutionally burdensome in the context of a special election because of the short time for collection of signatures between notice of the election and the filing deadline.  The Chicago Board's primary response was that the decision in Jackson v. Ogilvie, 325 F.Supp. 864 (N.D.Ill.), summarily aff'd 403 U.S. 925, 91 S.Ct. 2247, 29 L.Ed.2d 705 (1971), upholding Illinois' 5% signature requirement, foreclosed the constitutional challenge in this case.6\n\n\n5\nIn an opinion issued on March 14, 1977, the District Court determined that Jackson addressed neither the circumstances of a special election nor the disparity between state and city signature requirements at issue here.   Socialist Workers Party v. Chicago Bd. of Election Comm'rs, 433 F.Supp. 11, 16-17, 19.  On the merits of appellees' equal protection challenge, the court found\n\n\n6\n\"[no] rational reason why a petition with identical      signatures can satisfy the legitimate state interests for      restricting ballot access in state elections, and yet fail to      do the same in a lesser unit.  Lendall v. Jernigan, 424      F.Supp. 951 (E.D.Ark.1977).  Any greater requirement than      25,000 signatures cannot be said to be the least drastic      means of accomplishing the state's goals, and must be found      to unduly impinge [on] the constitutional rights of      independents, new political parties, and their adherents.\"      Id., at 20 (footnote omitted).\n\n\n7\nAccordingly, the District Court permanently enjoined the enforcement of the 5% provision insofar as it mandated more than 25,000 signatures, the number required for statewide elections. The court also declined to dismiss appellees' claim that the April 4 filing deadline coupled with the signature requirement impermissibly burdened First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, but it postponed a decision on this issue pending submission of additional evidence to justify the selection of that date.\n\n\n8\nOn March 17, 1977, the Chicago Board and the appellees concluded a settlement agreement with respect to the unresolved issues.  The agreement was incorporated into an order entered the same day which provided that \"solely as applied to the Special Mayoral Election to be held in Chicago on June 7, 1977,\" the signature requirement would be reduced to 20,000 and the filing deadline extended to April 18.  App. 74.  The District Court denied the State Board's subsequent motion to vacate both orders.\n\n\n9\nThe State Board, but not the Chicago Board, appealed from both the March 14 order and the March 17 order.  In a per curiam decision rendered six months after the election, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit adopted the opinion of the District Court.  566 F.2d 586, 587 (1977).  Also, with respect to the March 17 order, the Court of Appeals dismissed as moot the State Board's contention that the Chicago Board lacked authority to conclude a settlement agreement without prior state approval. In so ruling, the court noted that the settlement order applied only to the June 7 election, which had long passed, and held that the question of the Chicago Board's authority for its actions was not \"capable of repetition, yet evading review,\" Id., at 588, quoting DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312, 318-319, 94 S.Ct. 1704, 1706-1707, 40 L.Ed.2d 164 (1974).\n\n\n10\nWe noted probable jurisdiction, 435 U.S. 994, 98 S.Ct. 1644, 56 L.Ed.2d 82 (1978), and we now affirm.\n\nII\n\n11\nAppellant argues here, as it did below, that this Court's summary affirmance of Jackson v. Ogilvie, supra, is dispositive of the equal protection challenge here.  In analyzing this contention, we note at the outset that summary affirmances have considerably less precedential value than an opinion on the merits.  See Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 671, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1359, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).  As Mr. Chief Justice BURGER observed in Fusari v. Steinberg, 419 U.S. 379, 392, 95 S.Ct. 533, 541, 42 L.Ed.2d 521 (1975) (concurring opinion), \"upon fuller consideration of an issue under plenary review, the Court has not hesitated to discard a rule which a line of summary affirmances may appear to have established.\"  See Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S. 1, 14, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 2891, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976).\n\n\n12\nMoreover, we agree with the District Court's conclusion that Jackson does not govern the issues currently before us.  In that case, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, an independent candidate for Mayor of Chicago, attacked the 5% signature requirement for independent candidates as an impermissible burden on the exercise of First Amendment rights.  He contended as well that the discrepancy between the 5% rule and the less stringent requirements for candidates of established political parties violated the Equal Protection Clause.  A three-judge District Court rejected both claims, finding the 5% requirement reasonable and the burdens imposed on independent and established party candidates roughly equivalent.  Appellees mount a different challenge.  They do not attack the lines drawn between independent and established party candidates.  Rather, their equal protection claim rests on the discrimination between those independent candidates and new parties seeking access to the ballot in statewide elections and those similarly situated candidates and parties seeking access in city elections.\n\n\n13\nAppellant urges, however, that even though the District Court in Jackson did not explicitly mention the equal protection issue presented here, the issue was raised in a memorandum supporting Jackson filed with the District Court by the State.  In the course of arguing that the election law discriminated against independent candidates, the memorandum stated:\n\n\n14\n\"It must also be remembered that it is even more      difficult for an independent candidate to obtain signatures      than it would be for an independent party.  Yet a whole new State      political party needs only 25,000 signatures throughout the      entire State for state officers, (Section 10-2), while a      single independent candidate for only the office of Mayor of      Chicago, needs almost 60,000 signatures.  This also is an      invidious discrimination against one seeking the office of      Mayor of Chicago.\"  Memorandum of Law, App. to Juris.      Statement in Jackson v. Ogilvie,, O.T.1970, No. 70-1341, p.      B-23.7\n\n\n15\nIn view of the District Court's ultimate decision, appellant contends, this issue was necessarily resolved against Jackson, and therefore was resolved by this Court as well in its summary affirmance.\n\n\n16\nThe District Court in Jackson, however, framed the equal protection issue before it as \"whether [the 5% signature] requirement operates to discriminate against the plaintiff by depriving him of a right granted to candidates of established political parties.\"  325 F.Supp., at 868.  The jurisdictional statement posed the question in similar terms.  Juris. Statement in Jackson v. Ogilvie, O.T.1970, No. 70-1341, pp. 14-15.  Although the jurisdictional statement alluded to the State's memorandum, id., at 15, and incorporated it as a separate appendix, id., at B-21\u2014B-24, at no point did it directly address the question now before us.\n\n\n17\nThis omission disposes of appellant's argument.  As we stated in Mandel v. Bradley, 432 U.S. 173, 176, 97 S.Ct. 2238, 2240, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977), the precedential effect of a summary affirmance can extend no farther than \"the precise issues presented and necessarily decided by those actions.\"  A summary disposition affirms only the judgment of the court below, ibid., quoting Fusari v. Steinberg, supra, 419 U.S., at 391-392, 95 S.Ct., at 540-541 (BURGER, C. J., concurring), and no more may be read into our action than was essential to sustain that judgment.  See Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., supra, 424 U.S. at 14, 96 S.Ct. at 2891;  McCarthy v. Philadelphia Civil Service Comm'n, 424 U.S. 645, 646, 96 S.Ct. 1154, 47 L.Ed.2d 366 (1976) (per curiam ). Questions which \"merely lurk in the record,\"  Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S. 507, 511, 45 S.Ct. 148, 149, 69 L.Ed. 411 (1925), are not resolved, and no resolution of them may be inferred.  Assuming that the State's memorandum in Jackson can be read as advancing the issue presented here, see n. 7, supra, the issue was by no means adequately presented to and necessarily decided by this Court.  Jackson therefore has no effect on the constitutional claim advanced by appellees.\n\nIII\n\n18\nIn determining whether the Illinois signature requirements for new parties and independent candidates as applied in the city of Chicago violate the Equal Protection Clause, we must examine the character of the classification in question, the importance of the individual interests at stake, and the state interests asserted in support of the classification.  See Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, 415 U.S. 250, 253-254, 94 S.Ct. 1076, 1079-1080, 39 L.Ed.2d 306 (1974);  Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 335, 92 S.Ct. 995, 999, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972);  Kramer v. Union School Dist., 395 U.S. 621, 626, 89 S.Ct. 1886, 1889, 23 L.Ed.2d 583 (1969);  Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23, 30, 89 S.Ct. 5, 10, 21 L.Ed.2d 24 (1968).\n\n\n19\nThe provisions of the Illinois Election Code at issue incorporate a geographic classification.  For purposes of setting the minimum-signature requirements, the Code distinguishes state candidates, political parties, and the voters supporting each, from city candidates, parties, and voters.  In 1977, an independent candidate or a new political party in Chicago, a city with approximately 718,937 voters eligible to sign nominating petitions for the mayoral election in 1977,8 had to secure over 10,000 more signatures on nominating petitions than an independent candidate or new party in state elections, who had a pool of approximately 4.5 million eligible voters from which to obtain signatures.9  That the distinction between state and city elections undoubtedly is valid for some purposes does not resolve whether it is valid as applied here.\n\n\n20\nRestrictions on access to the ballot burden two distinct and fundamental rights, \"the right of individuals to associate for the advancement of political beliefs, and the right of qualified voters, regardless of their political persuasion, to cast their votes effectively.\"  Williams v. Rhodes, supra, 393 U.S. at 30, 89 S.Ct. at 10.  The freedom to associate as a political party, a right we have recognized as fundamental, see 393 U.S., at 30-31, 89 S.Ct. at 10, has diminished practical value if the party can be kept off the ballot.  Access restrictions also implicate the right to vote because absent recourse to referendums, \"voters can assert their preferences only through candidates or parties or both.\" Lubin v. Panish, 415 U.S. 709, 716, 94 S.Ct. 1315, 1320, 39 L.Ed.2d 702 (1974).  By limiting the choices available to voters, the State impairs the voters' ability to express their political preferences.  And for reasons too self-evident to warrant amplification here, we have often reiterated that voting is of the most fundamental significance under our constitutional structure. Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 17, 84 S.Ct. 526, 534, 11 L.Ed.2d 481 (1964);  Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 555, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1378, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964);  Dunn v. Blumstein, supra, 405 U.S. at 336, 92 S.Ct. at 999.\n\n\n21\nWhen such vital individual rights are at stake, a State must establish that its classification is necessary to serve a compelling interest.   American Party of Texas v. White, 415 U.S. 767, 780-781, 94 S.Ct. 1296, 1305-1306, 39 L.Ed.2d 744 (1974); Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 736, 94 S.Ct. 1274, 1282, 39 L.Ed.2d 714 (1974);  Williams v. Rhodes, supra, 393 U.S. at 31, 89 S.Ct. at 10.  To be sure, the Court has previously acknowledged that States have a legitimate interest in regulating the number of candidates on the ballot.  In Lubin v. Panish, supra, 415 U.S. at 715, 94 S.Ct. at 1319, we observed:\n\n\n22\n\"A procedure inviting or permitting every citizen to      present himself to the voters on the ballot without some      means of measuring the seriousness of the candidate's desire      and motivation would make rational voter choices more      difficult because of the size of the ballot and hence would      tend to impede the electoral process.  . . .  The means of      testing the seriousness of a given candidacy may be open to      debate;  the fundamental importance of ballots of reasonable      size limited to serious candidates with some prospects of      public support is not.\"\n\n\n23\nSimilarly, in Bullock v. Carter, 405 U.S. 134, 145, 92 S.Ct. 849, 857, 31 L.Ed.2d 92 (1972) (footnote omitted), the Court expressed concern for the States' need to assure that the winner of an election \"is the choice of a majority, or at least a strong plurality, of those voting, without the expense and burden of runoff elections.\"  Consequently, we have upheld properly drawn statutes that require a preliminary showing of a \"significant modicum of support\" before a candidate or party may appear on the ballot.  Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U.S. 431, 442, 91 S.Ct. 1970, 1976, 29 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971);  see, e. g., American Party of Texas v. White, supra.\n\n\n24\nHowever, our previous opinions have also emphasized that \"even when pursuing a legitimate interest, a State may not choose means that unnecessarily restrict constitutionally protected liberty,\" Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 58-59, 94 S.Ct. 303, 308, 38 L.Ed.2d 260 (1973), and we have required that States adopt the least drastic means to achieve their ends.  Lubin v. Panish, supra, 415 U.S. at 716, 94 S.Ct. at 1320;  Williams v. Rhodes, supra, 393 U.S. at 31-33, 89 S.Ct. at 10-11.  This requirement is particularly important where restrictions on access to the ballot are involved.  The States' interest in screening out frivolous candidates must be considered in light of the significant role that third parties have played in the political development of the Nation.  Abolitionists, Progressives, and Populists have undeniably had influence, if not always electoral success.  As the records of such parties demonstrate, an election campaign is a means of disseminating ideas as well as attaining political office.  See A. Bickel, Reform and Continuity 79-80 (1971);  W. Binkley, American Political Parties 181-205 (3d ed. 1959);  H. Penniman, Sait's American Political Parties and Elections 223-239 (5th ed. 1952).  Overbroad restrictions on ballot access jeopardize this form of political expression.\n\n\n25\nThe signature requirements for independent candidates and new political parties seeking offices in Chicago are plainly not the least restrictive means of protecting the State's objectives.  The Illinois Legislature has determined that its interest in avoiding overloaded ballots in statewide elections is served by the 25,000-signature requirement.  Yet appellant has advanced no reason, much less a compelling one, why the State needs a more stringent requirement for Chicago.  At oral argument, appellant explained that the signature provisions for statewide elections originally reflected a different approach than those for elections in political subdivisions.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 35-37.  Not only were independent candidates and new political parties in state elections required to obtain 25,000 signatures, but those signatures also had to meet standards pertaining to geographic distribution.  By comparison, candidates and parties in city elections had only to obtain signatures from a flat percentage of the qualified voters.  In Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U.S. 814, 89 S.Ct. 1493, 23 L.Ed.2d 1 (1969), this Court struck down on equal protection grounds Illinois' requirement that the nominating petition of a candidate for statewide office include the signatures of at least 200 qualified voters from at least 50 counties.  Following Moore, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit invalidated a provision in the amended statute which specified that no more than 13,000 signatures on a new party's petition for statewide elections could come from any one county. Communist Party of Illinois v. State Board of Elections, 518 F.2d 517, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 986, 96 S.Ct. 394, 46 L.Ed.2d 303 (1975).  Thus, appellant noted, the invalidation of the geographic constraints has tied the requirements for both city and state candidates solely to a population standard, giving rise to the anomaly at issue here.\n\n\n26\nAlthough this account may explain the anomaly, appellant still has suggested no reasons that justify its continuation. Historical accident, without more, cannot constitute a compelling state interest.  We therefore hold that the Illinois Election Code is unconstitutional insofar as it requires independent candidates and new political parties to obtain more than 25,000 signatures in Chicago.\n\nIV\n\n27\nAppellant finally challenges the Court of Appeals' disposition of its appeal from the March 17 settlement order.  The court dismissed as moot appellant's claim that the Chicago Board lacked authority to conclude a settlement agreement without the State's consent.  In appellant's view, the court erred in not placing this claim within the exception to the mootness doctrine for cases that are \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U.S. 498, 515, 31 S.Ct. 279, 283, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911).\n\n\n28\nIn Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U.S. 147, 149, 96 S.Ct. 347, 349, 46 L.Ed.2d 350 (1975), we elaborated on this exception, holding that a case is not moot when:\n\n\n29\n\"(1) the challenged action was in its duration too short      to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration,      and (2) there was a reasonable expectation that the same      complaining party would be subjected to the same action      again.\"\n\n\n30\nAlthough the first branch of the test is satisfied here, appellant has presented no evidence creating a reasonable expectation that the Chicago Board will repeat its purportedly unauthorized actions in subsequent elections.  Appellant's conclusory assertions that the actions are capable of repetition are not sufficient to satisfy the Weinstein test, particularly since appellant does not contend that the Chicago Board has ever attempted previously to conclude litigation without its approval. The Chicago Board's entry into a settlement agreement reflected neither a policy it had determined to continue, cf. United States v. New York Telephone Co., 434 U.S. 159, 165 n. 6, 98 S.Ct. 364, 368, 54 L.Ed.2d 376 (1977), nor even a consistent pattern of behavior, cf. SEC v. Sloan, 436 U.S. 103, 109-110, 98 S.Ct. 1702, 1707, 56 L.Ed.2d 148 (1978).  And the Chicago Board's action patently was not a matter of statutory prescription, as was the case in other election decisions on which appellant relies, e. g., Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S., at 737 n. 8, 94 S.Ct., at 1282;  Moore v. Ogilvie, supra, 394 U.S. at 816, 89 S.Ct. at 1494.  We therefore find that appellant's challenge was properly dismissed as moot.\n\n\n31\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n\n32\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n33\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE concurs in the judgment.\n\n\n34\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN, concurring.\n\n\n35\nAlthough I join the Court's opinion and its strict-scrutiny approach for election cases, I add these comments to record purposefully, and perhaps somewhat belatedly, my unrelieved discomfort with what seems to be a continuing tendency in this Court to use as tests such easy phrases as \"compelling [state] interest\" and \"least drastic [or restrictive] means.\"  See, ante, at 184, 185, and 186.  I have never been able fully to appreciate just what a \"compelling state interest\" is.  If it means \"convincingly controlling,\" or \"incapable of being overcome\" upon any balancing process, then, of course, the test merely announces an inevitable result, and the test is no test at all.  And, for me, \"least drastic means\" is a slippery slope and also the signal of the result the Court has chosen to reach.  A judge would be unimaginative indeed if he could not come up with something a little less \"drastic\" or a little less \"restrictive\" in almost any situation, and thereby enable himself to vote to strike legislation down.  This is reminiscent of the Court's indulgence, a few decades ago, in substantive due process in the economic area as a means of nullification.\n\n\n36\nI feel, therefore, and have always felt, that these phrases are really not very helpful for constitutional analysis.  They are too convenient and result oriented, and I must endeavor to disassociate myself from them.  Apart from their use, however, the result the Court reaches here is the correct one.  It is with these reservations that I join the Court's opinion.\n\n\n37\nMr. Justice STEVENS, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n38\nPlacing additional names on a ballot adds to the cost of conducting elections and tends to confuse voters.  The State therefore has a valid interest in limiting access to the ballot to serious candidates.  If that interest is adequately served by a 25,000-signature requirement in a statewide election, the same interest cannot justify a larger requirement in a smaller election.\n\n\n39\nNonetheless, I am not sure that the disparity evidences a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  The constitutional requirement that Illinois govern impartially would be implicated by a rule that discriminates, for example, between Socialists and Republicans or between Catholics and Protestants.  But I question whether it has any application to rules prescribing different qualifications for different political offices.  Rather than deciding that question, I would simply hold that legislation imposing a significant interference with access to the ballot must rest on a rational predicate.  This legislative remnant is without any such support.  It is either a product of a malfunction of the legislative process or merely a by-product of this Court's decision in Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U.S. 814, 89 S.Ct. 1493, 23 L.Ed.2d 1, seeante, at 190-191 (REHNQUIST, J., concurring in judgment).  In either event, I believe it has deprived appellees of their liberty without the \"due process of lawmaking\" that the Fourteenth Amendment requires.  Cf. Delaware Tribal Business Committee v. Weeks, 430 U.S. 73, 98, 97 S.Ct. 911, 925, 51 L.Ed.2d 173 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\n\n\n40\nFor these reasons I concur in the Court's judgment and in Parts I, II, and IV of its opinion.\n\n\n41\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n42\nI concur in the judgment of the Court, but I cannot join its opinion:  It employs an elaborate analysis where a very simple one would suffice.  The disparity between the state and city signature requirements does not make sense, and this Court is intimately familiar with the reasons why.\n\n\n43\nIn 1968, Illinois had a coherent set of petition requirements for obtaining a place on the ballot.  In order to appear on the ballot in a county or city election, it was necessary for independent candidates and new political parties to obtain voter signatures equal in number to 5% of the voters who voted in the political subdivision at the last general election.  Requirements for statewide office put greater emphasis on geographical balance: Independent candidates and new political parties needed 25,000 signatures, and at least 200 signatures had to be obtained from each of 50 counties within the State.  Thus, a candidate for statewide office at that time could get on the ballot with fewer signatures than a candidate for office in Cook County, but he was also subject to special restrictions.  It was reasonable for Illinois to conclude that this scheme best vindicated its interest in \"protect[ing] the integrity of its political processes from frivolous or fraudulent candidacies.\"  Bullock v. Carter, 405 U.S. 134, 145, 92 S.Ct. 849, 857, 31 L.Ed.2d 92 (1972).  Cook County is not Illinois, and all the State asked was that candidates and political parties interested in statewide office produce this minimal evidence of statewide support.\n\n\n44\nIn 1969, this Court held that the 200 voters per county requirement violated the Equal Protection Clause because different counties had different populations.  Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U.S. 814, 89 S.Ct. 1493, 23 L.Ed.2d 1 (1969).  That decision led to a holding by the Seventh Circuit that the statute, as amended by the legislature after Moore to place a 13,000-signature limit on new political party signatures from any one county, was likewise a denial of equal protection.  Communist Party of Illinois v. State Board of Elections, 518 F.2d 517 (C.A.7), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 986, 96 S.Ct. 394, 46 L.Ed.2d 303 (1975).\n\n\n45\nThe courts having knocked out key panels in an otherwise symmetrical mosaic, it is not surprising that little sense can be made of what is left.  Given this history, I cannot subscribe to my Brother STEVENS' alternative characterization of Illinois' problem as \"a malfunction of the legislative process.\"  The legislature enacted a comprehensive Election Code, and amended it once in response to a decision of this Court.  The attorneys for the State Board of Elections are now placed in the position of having to defend a law which is but a truncated version of the original enactment.\n\n\n46\nAll of this explains the disparate treatment of statewide and Chicago candidates;  it does not justify it under any rational-basis test, and appellant has scarcely made any effort to do so before this Court.  In the light of this history, and without engaging in any elaborate analysis which pretends that we are dealing with the considered product of a legislature, I would hold that the disparate treatment bears no rational relationship to any state interest.\n\n\n\n1\n Under Ill.Ann.Stat., ch. 46, \u00a7 10-2 (Supp.1978):\n\"A political party which, at the last general election for State and county officers, polled for its candidate for Governor more than 5% of the entire vote cast for Governor, is hereby declared to be an 'established political party' as to the State and as to any district or political subdivision thereof.\n\"A political party which, at the last election in any congressional district, legislative district, county, township, school district, park district, municipality or other district or political subdivision of the State, polled more than 5% of the entire vote cast within such congressional district, legislative district, county, township, school district, park district, municipality, or political subdivision of the State, where such district, political subdivision or municipality, as the case may be, has voted as a unit for the election of officers to serve the respective territorial area of such district, political subdivision or municipality, is hereby declared to be an 'established political party' within the meaning of this Article as to such district, political subdivision or municipality.\"\nA new political party is one that has not met these requirements.\nIndividuals desiring to form a new political party throughout the State must file with the State Board of Elections a petition that, inter alia, is \"signed by not less than 25,000 qualified voters.\"  In Communist Party of Illinois v. State Board of Elections, 518 F.2d 517 (C.A.7), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 986, 96 S.Ct. 394, 46 L.Ed.2d 303 (1975), the Court of Appeals held unconstitutional the proviso in this section requiring \"that no more than 13,000 signatures from the same county may be counted toward the required total of 25,000 signatures.\"  Ill.Ann.Stat., ch. 46, \u00a7 10-2 (Supp.1978).\nA party that files a completed petition becomes entitled to place \"upon the ballot at such next ensuing election such list of . . .  candidates for offices to be voted for throughout the State . . .  under the name of and as the candidates of such new political party.\"  Ibid.\nWith respect to independent candidates, \u00a7 10-3 (Supp.1978) provides in pertinent part:\n\"Nomination of independent candidates (not candidates of any political party), for any office to be filled by the voters of the State at large may also be made by nomination papers signed in the aggregate for each candidate by not less than 25,000 qualified voters of the State;  Provided, however, that no more than 13,000 signatures from the same county may be counted toward the required total of 25,000 signatures.\"\nThe record does not reveal whether the State enforces the proviso.\n\n\n2\n Section 10-2 provides:\n\"If such new political party shall be formed for any district or political subdivision less than the entire State, such petition shall be signed by qualified voters equaling in number not less than 5% of the number of voters who voted at the next preceding general election in such district or political subdivision in which such district or political subdivision voted as a unit for the election of officers to serve its respective territorial area.\"\nUnder \u00a7 10-3:\n\"Nominations of independent candidates for public office within any district or political subdivision less than the State, may be made by nomination papers signed in the aggregate for each candidate by qualified voters of such district, or political division, equaling not less than 5%, nor more than 8% (or 50 more than the minimum, whichever is greater) of the number of persons, who voted at the next preceding general election in such district or political subdivision in which such district or political subdivision voted as a unit for the election of officers to serve its respective territorial area.\"\n\n\n3\n Candidates and new parties in Cook County, Ill., which is more populous than Chicago, would also have to obtain more than 25,000 signatures.  In all political subdivisions of the State other than Chicago and Cook County, the 5% standard requires fewer than 25,000 signatures.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 20.\n\n\n4\n This disparity in the signature requirements arose because the State and Chicago Boards used voting figures from the April 1, 1975, elections in computing the requirements for independents, but used figures from the November 2, 1976, general election in their calculations for new parties.  The pertinent statutory language regarding signature requirements for independent candidates, however, is identical to that for new parties. Compare Ill.Ann.Stat., ch. 46, \u00a7 10-3 (Supp.1978), with \u00a7 10-2.\nSection 10-6 of the Election Code provides that nominating petitions for independents and new parties must be filed at least 64 days prior to the election, here, by April 4.  The record does not reflect what caused the discrepancy in filing dates in this case.\n\n\n5\n The Chicago Board is responsible for accepting nominating petitions for candidates and preparing the ballots for special elections.  Ill.Ann.Stat., ch. 46, \u00a7\u00a7 7-60, 7-62, 10-6 (Supp.1978).  It also has \"charge of and make[s] provisions for all elections, general, special, local, municipal, state and county, and all others of every description to be held in such city or any part thereof, at any time.\"  \u00a7 6-26 (Supp.1978).  The State Board exercises \"general supervision over the administration of the registration and election laws throughout the State.\"  \u00a7 1A-1 (Supp.1978);  Ill.Const., Art. 3, \u00a7 5.\n\n\n6\n Although the State Board was afforded notice and an opportunity to participate in the District Court proceedings, only the Chicago Board appeared for argument on plaintiff-appellees' motion for a permanent injunction.  After the court entered the injunction, the State Board moved to vacate the decision, advancing many of the grounds previously asserted by the Chicago Board.\nOnly the State Board has appealed to this Court.  The Chicago Board, defending its settlement agreement, see infra, at 180, appears as an appellee.  Subsequent references to the \"appellees\" in this opinion, however, will include only the plaintiff-appellees.\n\n\n7\n Appellees Rose and the United States Labor Party argue that even this statement does not present the issue now before the Court.  In their view, it refers to the purported disparity between the treatment of independent candidates and that of new political parties.  In fact, appellees argue, there is and was no such disparity.

CABELL, et al., Appellantsv.Jose CHAVEZ-SALIDO et al.\nNo. 80-990.\nArgued Nov. 3, 1981.\nDecided Jan. 12, 1982.\n\n\nSyllabus\n\nSection 1031(a) of the Cal.Gov't Code Ann. (West 1980) requires \"public officers or employees declared by law to be peace officers\" to be United States citizens;  \u00a7 830.5 of the Cal.Penal Code Ann. (West Supp.1981) declares probation officers and deputy probation officers to be \"peace officers.\"  Appellees, lawfully admitted permanent resident aliens, after unsuccessfully applying for positions as Deputy Probation Officers in Los Angeles County, filed suit in Federal District Court challenging the statutory citizenship requirement under, inter alia, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and seeking declaratory, injunctive, and other relief.  The District Court held the requirement unconstitutional both on its face and as applied to appellees.\nHeld:  The statutory citizenship requirement is valid.  Pp. 436-447.\n(a) While a restriction on lawfully resident aliens that primarily affects economic interests is subject to strict judicial scrutiny, such scrutiny is out of place when the restriction primarily serves a political function.  A claim that a particular restriction on legally resident aliens serves political and not economic goals is to be evaluated in a two-step process.  Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U.S. 634, 93 S.Ct. 2842, 37 L.Ed.2d 853.  First, the specificity of the classification will be examined:  a classification that is substantially overinclusive or underinclusive tends to undercut the governmental claim that the classification serves legitimate political ends.  Second, even if the classification is sufficiently tailored, it may be applied in the particular case only to \"persons holding state elective or important nonelective executive, legislative, and judicial positions.\"  Sugarman v. Dougall, supra, at 647, 93 S.Ct., at 2850.  Pp. 436-441.\n(b) The statutes in question are an attempt to limit the exercise of the sovereign's coercive police powers over the community to citizens.  They are sufficiently tailored in light of that aim to withstand a facial challenge when reviewed under the appropriate equal protection standard for such an exercise of sovereign power.  Pp. 441-444. (c) Probation officers sufficiently partake of the sovereign's power to exercise coercive force over the individual that they may be required to be citizens.  Although the range of individuals over whom such officers exercise supervisory authority is limited, the officers' power with respect to those individuals is broad.  A citizenship requirement is an appropriate limitation on those who exercise and, therefore, symbolize this power of the political community over those who fall within its jurisdiction.  Pp. 444-447.\n490 F.Supp. 984, reversed and remanded.\nWilliam F. Stewart, Los Angeles, Cal., for appellants.\nMary S. Burdick, Los Angeles, Cal., for appellees.\nJustice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nIn this case we once again consider a citizenship requirement imposed by a State on those seeking to fill certain governmental offices.  California Gov't Code Ann. \u00a7 1031(a) (West 1980) requires \"public officers or employees declared by law to be peace officers\" to be citizens of the United States.  California Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 830.5 (West Supp.1981), provides that probation officers and deputy probation officers are \"peace officers.\"  A three-judge District Court of the Central District of California held the California requirement unconstitutional both on its face and as applied to the appellees, who sought positions as Deputy Probation Officers.  490 F.Supp. 984.\n\n\n2\n* Appellees were, at the time the complaint was filed, lawfully admitted permanent resident aliens living in Los Angeles County, Cal.1  Each applied unsuccessfully for positions as Deputy Probation Officers with the Los Angeles County Probation Department.2  With respect to two of the three appellees, the parties stipulated that the failure to obtain the positions sought was the result of the statutory citizenship requirement.3\n\n\n3\nAppellees filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California challenging the constitutionality of the citizenship requirement under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983.  Named as defendants were certain individual county officials, in their official capacity, and the County of Los Angeles.4\n\n\n4\nAppellees alleged unconstitutional discrimination against aliens, impermissible infringement upon their constitutional right to travel, and unconstitutional interference with Congress' plenary power to regulate aliens.  They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorney's fees and damages for two of the plaintiffs.  A three-judge court was properly convened.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2281 (1970 ed.), 2284.5\n\n\n5\nIn February 1977, the District Court concluded that the statutory citizenship requirement was unconstitutional both on its face and as applied.  Chavez-Salido v. Cabell, 427 F.Supp. 158. That decision rested entirely on appellees' arguments under the Equal Protection Clause;  it did not reach the right to travel and federal pre-emption claims.  This Court, 436 U.S. 901, 98 S.Ct. 2228, 56 L.Ed.2d 398 vacated and remanded that judgment for further consideration in light of Foley v. Connelie, 435 U.S. 291, 98 S.Ct. 1067, 55 L.Ed.2d 287 (1978), which upheld a New York statute requiring state troopers to be United States citizens. County of Los Angeles v. Chavez-Salido, 436 U.S. 901, 98 S.Ct. 2228, 56 L.Ed.2d 398 (1978).  On remand, the District Court reconsidered its previous position in light of both Foley, supra, and Ambach v. Norwick, 441 U.S. 68, 99 S.Ct. 1589, 60 L.Ed.2d 49 (1979), which held that a State may refuse to employ as elementary and secondary school teachers aliens who are eligible for United States citizenship but fail to seek naturalization.  With Judge Curtis dissenting, the court found its prior views still valid and convincing.  It, therefore, came to the identical conclusion that the California statutory scheme was constitutionally invalid both facially and as applied.\n\n\n6\nWe noted probable jurisdiction, 450 U.S. 978, 101 S.Ct. 1511, 67 L.Ed.2d 813 (1981), and now reverse.\n\nII\n\n7\nOver the years, this Court has many times considered state classifications dealing with aliens.  See, e.g., Ambach v. Norwick, supra;  Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S. 1, 97 S.Ct. 2120, 53 L.Ed.2d 63 (1977);  Foley v. Connelie, supra;  Examining Board v. Flores de Otero, 426 U.S. 572, 96 S.Ct. 2264, 49 L.Ed.2d 65 (1976);  In re Griffiths, 413 U.S. 717, 93 S.Ct. 2851, 37 L.Ed.2d 910 (1973);  Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U.S. 634, 93 S.Ct. 2842, 37 L.Ed.2d 853 (1973);  Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971);  Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm'n, 334 U.S. 410, 68 S.Ct. 1138, 92 L.Ed. 1478 (1948);  Crane v. New York, 239 U.S. 195, 36 S.Ct. 85, 60 L.Ed. 218 (1915);  Heim v. McCall, 239 U.S. 175, 36 S.Ct. 78, 60 L.Ed. 206 (1915);  Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 36 S.Ct. 7, 60 L.Ed. 131 (1915);  Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886).  As we have noted before, those cases \"have not formed an unwavering line over the years.\"  Ambach v. Norwick, supra, 441 U.S., at 72, 99 S.Ct., at 1592.  But to say that the decisions do not fall into a neat pattern is not to say that they fall into no pattern.  In fact, they illustrate a not unusual characteristic of legal development; broad principles are articulated, narrowed when applied to new contexts, and finally replaced when the distinctions they rely upon are no longer tenable.\n\n\n8\nIn Yick Wo v. Hopkins, supra, the Court held both that resident aliens fall within the protection of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that the state could not deny to aliens the right to carry on a \"harmless and useful occupation\" available to citizens.  Although Yick Wo proclaimed that hostility toward aliens was not a permissible ground for a discriminatory classification, it dealt only with a situation in which government had actively intervened in the sphere of private employment.  In a series of later cases it became clear that Yick Wo did not mean that the State had to be strictly neutral as between aliens and citizens:  The Court continued to uphold the right of the State to withhold from aliens public benefits and public resources.  Terrace v. Thompson, 263 U.S. 197, 44 S.Ct. 15, 68 L.Ed. 255 (1923) (ownership of land); Heim v. McCall, supra (employment on public works projects); Patsone v. Pennsylvania, 232 U.S. 138, 34 S.Ct. 281, 58 L.Ed. 539 (1914) (taking of wild game).\n\n\n9\nThis distinction between government distribution of public resources and intervention in the private market was clearly established as the principle by which state regulations of aliens were to be evaluated in Truax v. Raich, supra, which struck down a state statute requiring all employers of more than five workers to employ \"not less than eighty per cent. qualified electors or native born citizens of the United States:\"\n\n\n10\n\"The discrimination defined by the act does not pertain to      the regulation or distribution of the public domain, or of      the common property or resources of the people of the State,      the enjoyment of which may be limited to its citizens as      against both aliens and citizens of other States.\"  Id., at      39-40, 36 S.Ct., at 9-10.\n\n\n11\nThis public\/private distinction, the \"special public interest\" doctrine, seeGraham v. Richardson, supra, 403 U.S., at 372, 374, 91 S.Ct., at 1852, 1853;  Sugarman v. Dougall, supra, 413 U.S., at 643, 644, 93 S.Ct., at 2848, was challenged in Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm'n, supra, which held that California could not bar lawfully resident aliens from obtaining commercial fishing licenses:\n\n\n12\n\"To whatever extent the fish in the three-mile belt off      California may be 'capable of ownership' by California, we      think that 'ownership' is inadequate to justify California in      excluding any or all aliens who are lawful residents of the State from making a living by fishing in the ocean off      its shores while permitting all others to do so.\"  Id., at      421, 68 S.Ct., at 1143.\n\n\n13\nAs the principle governing analysis of state classifications of aliens, who are lawful residents, the distinction was further eroded in Graham v. Richardson, supra, which read Takahashi as \"cast[ing] doubt on the continuing validity of the special public-interest doctrine in all contexts,\" 403 U.S., at 374, 91 S.Ct., at 1853, and held that a State could not distinguish between lawfully resident aliens and citizens in the distribution of welfare benefits.  Returning to Yick Wo's holding that lawfully present aliens fall within the protection of the Equal Protection Clause and citing the more recent theory of a two-tiered equal protection scrutiny, Graham implied that there would be very few if any\u2014areas in which a State could legitimately distinguish between its citizens and lawfully resident aliens:\n\n\n14\n\"Aliens as a class are a prime example of a 'discrete and      insular' minority . . . for whom . . . heightened judicial      solicitude is appropriate.  Accordingly, it was said in      Takahashi, 334 U.S., at 420 [68 S.Ct., at 1143] that 'the      power of a state to apply its laws exclusively to its alien      inhabitants as a class is confined within narrow limits.' \"      403 U.S., at 372, 91 S.Ct., at 1852.\n\n\n15\nThe cases through Graham dealt for the most part with attempts by the States to retain certain economic benefits exclusively for citizens.  Since Graham, the Court has confronted claims distinguishing between the economic and sovereign functions of government.  This distinction has been supported by the argument that although citizenship is not a relevant ground for the distribution of economic benefits, it is a relevant ground for determining membership in the political community.  \"We recognize a State's interest in establishing its own form of government, and in limiting participation in that government to those who are within 'the basic conception of a political community.' \" Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U.S., at 642, 93 S.Ct., at 2847.  While not retreating from the position that restrictions on lawfully resident aliens that primarily affect economic interests are subject to heightened judicial scrutiny, ibid.;  In re Griffiths, supra;  Examining Board v. Flores de Otero, supra, we have concluded that strict scrutiny is out of place when the restriction primarily serves a political function:  \"[O]ur scrutiny will not be so demanding where we deal with matters resting firmly within a State's constitutional prerogatives [and] constitutional responsibility for the establishment and operation of its own government, as well as the qualifications of an appropriately designated class of public office holders.\" Sugarman v. Dougall, supra, 413 U.S., at 648, 93 S.Ct., at 2850. We have thus \"not abandoned the general principle that some state functions are so bound up with the operation of the State as a governmental entity as to permit the exclusion from those functions of all persons who have not become part of the process of self-government.\"  Ambach v. Norwick, 441 U.S., at 73-74, 99 S.Ct., at 1593.  And in those areas the State's exclusion of aliens need not \"clear the high hurdle of 'strict scrutiny,' because [that] would 'obliterate all the distinctions between citizens and aliens, and thus depreciate the historic value of citizenship.' \"  Folley V Connelie, 435 U.S., at 295, 98 S.Ct., at 1070 (citation omitted).6\n\n\n16\nThe exclusion of aliens from basic governmental processes is not a deficiency in the democratic system but a necessary consequence of the community's process of political self-definition.  Self-government, whether direct or through representatives, begins by defining the scope of the community of the governed and thus of the governors as well:  Aliens are by definition those outside of this community.  Judicial incursions in this area may interfere with those aspects of democratic self-government that are most essential to it.  This distinction between the economic and political functions of government has, therefore, replaced the old public\/private distinction.  Although this distinction rests on firmer foundations than the old public\/private distinction, it may be difficult to apply in particular cases.\n\n\n17\nSugarman advised that a claim that a particular restriction on legally resident aliens serves political and not economic goals is to be evaluated in a two-step process.  First, the specificity of the classification will be examined:  a classification that is substantially overinclusive or underinclusive tends to undercut the governmental claim that the classification serves legitimate political ends.  The classification in Sugarman itself\u2014all members of the competitive civil service\u2014could not support the claim that it was an element in \"the State's broad power to define its political community,\" 413 U.S., at 643, 93 S.Ct., at 2848, because it indiscriminately swept in menial occupations, while leaving out some of the State's most important political functions.  Second, even if the classification is sufficiently tailored, it may be applied in the particular case only to \"persons holding state elective or important nonelective executive, legislative, and judicial positions,\" those officers who \"participate directly in the formulation, execution, or review of broad public policy\" and hence \"perform functions that go to the heart of representative government.\"  Id., at 647, 93 S.Ct., at 2850.7  We must therefore inquire whether the \"position in question . . . involves discretionary decisionmaking, or execution of policy, which substantially affects members of the political community.\"  Foley v. Connelie, supra, 435 U.S., at 296, 98 S.Ct., at 1070.\n\n\n18\nThe restriction at issue in this case passes both of the Sugarman tests.\n\nIII\n\n19\nAppellees argue, and the District Court agreed, that Cal.Gov't Code Ann. \u00a7 1031(a) (West 1980), which requires all state \"peace officers\" to be citizens, is unconstitutionally overinclusive:  \"Section 1031(a) is void as a law requiring citizenship which 'sweeps too broadly.' \"  490 F.Supp., at 986.8 The District Court failed to articulate any standard in reaching this conclusion.  Rather, it relied wholly on its belief that of the more than 70 positions included within the statutory classification of \"peace officer,\" some undefined number of them \"cannot be considered members of the political community no matter how liberally that category is viewed.\"  Id., at 987.  The District Court's entire argument on this point consisted of just one sentence:  \"There appears to be no justification whatever for excluding aliens, even those who have applied for citizenship, from holding public employment as cemetery sextons, furniture and bedding inspectors, livestock identification inspectors, and toll service employees.\"  Id., at 986.  In believing this sufficient, the District Court applied a standard of review far stricter than that approved in Sugarman and later cases.\n\n\n20\nWe need not hold that the District Court was wrong in concluding that citizenship may not be required of toll-service employees, cemetery sextons, and inspectors to hold that the District Court was wrong in striking down the statute on its face.9  The District Court assumed that if the statute was overinclusive at all, it could not stand.  This is not the proper standard.  Rather, the inquiry is whether the restriction reaches so far and is so broad and haphazard as to belie the State's claim that it is only attempting to ensure that an important function of government be in the hands of those having the \"fundamental legal bond of citizenship.\"  Ambach v. Norwick, 441 U.S., at 75, 99 S.Ct., at 1593.  Under this standard, the classifications used need not be precise;  there need only be a substantial fit.  Our examination of the California scheme convinces us that it is sufficiently tailored to withstand a facial challenge.\n\n\n21\nThe general requirements, including citizenship, for all California peace officers are found in Cal.Gov't Code Ann. \u00a7 1031 (West 1980).  That section, however, does not designate any particular official as a peace officer;  rather, Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 830 (West Supp.1981) lists the specific occupations that fall within the general category of \"peace officer.\"  Even a casual reading of the Penal Code makes clear that the unifying character of all categories of peace officers is their law enforcement function.  Specific categories are defined by either their geographical jurisdiction or the specific substantive laws they have the responsibility to enforce.  Thus, not surprisingly, the first categories listed include police officers at the county, city, and district levels.  \u00a7 830.1.  This is followed by various categories of police power authorized by the State:  e.g., highway patrol officers, the state police, and members of the California National Guard when ordered into active service.  \u00a7 830.2.  After this, the statute includes a long list of particular officers with responsibility for enforcement of different substantive areas of the law:  e.g., individuals charged with enforcement of the alcoholic beverage laws, the food and drug laws, fire laws, and the horse racing laws.  \u00a7 830.3.  Finally, there are several catchall provisions that include some officers with narrow geographic responsibilities\u2014e.g., park rangers, San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District police, harbor police, community college police, security officers of municipal utility districts, and security officers employed in government buildings\u2014and some with narrow \"clientele\"\u2014e.g., welfare-fraud or child-support investigators, correctional officers, parole and probation officers.  \u00a7\u00a7 830.31-830.6.\n\n\n22\nAlthough some of these categories may have only a tenuous connection to traditional police functions of law enforcement, the questionable classifications are comparatively few in number.10 The general law enforcement character of all California \"peace officers\" is underscored by the fact that all have the power to make arrests, \u00a7 836, and all receive a course of training in the exercise of their respective arrest powers and in the use of firearms.  \u00a7 832.  Foley made clear that a State may limit the exercise of the sovereign's coercive police powers over the members of the community to citizens.  The California statutes at issue here are an attempt to do just that.  They are sufficiently tailored in light of that aim to pass the lower level of scrutiny we articulated as the appropriate equal protection standard for such an exercise of sovereign power in Sugarman.11\n\nIV\n\n23\nThe District Court also held that the citizenship requirement was invalid as applied to the positions at issue here\u2014deputy probation officers.  In reaching this conclusion, it focused too narrowly on a comparison of the characteristics and functions of probation officers with those of the state troopers at issue in Foley and the teachers in Ambach. Foley and Ambach did not describe the outer limits of permissible citizenship requirements. For example, although both of those cases emphasized the communitywide responsibilities of teachers and police, there was no suggestion that judges, who deal only with a narrow subclass of the community, cannot be subject to a citizenship requirement. See Sugarman, 413 U.S., at 647, 93 S.Ct., at 2850.  Similarly, although both Foley and Ambach emphasized the unsupervised discretion that must be exercised by the teacher and the police officer in the performance of their duties, neither case suggested that jurors, who act under a very specific set of instructions, could not be required to be citizens.  See Perkins v. Smith, 370 F.Supp. 134 (Md.1974), summarily aff'd, 426 U.S. 913, 96 S.Ct. 2616, 49 L.Ed.2d 368 (1976).  Definition of the important sovereign functions of the political community is necessarily the primary responsibility of the representative branches of government, subject to limited judicial review.12\n\n\n24\nLooking at the functions of California probation officers, we conclude that they, like the state troopers involved in Foley, sufficiently partake of the sovereign's power to exercise coercive force over the individual that they may be limited to citizens. Although the range of individuals over whom probation officers exercise supervisory authority is limited, the powers of the probation officer are broad with respect to those over whom they exercise that authority.13  The probation officer has the power both to arrest, Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 830.5, 836, 1203.2 (West Supp.1981);  Cal.Civ.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 131.4 (West 1954);  and to release those over whom he has jurisdiction. Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 1203.1a (West Supp.1981).  He has the power and the responsibility to supervise probationers and insure that all the conditions of probation are met and that the probationer accomplishes a successful reintegration into the community. Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 1203.1 (West Supp. 1981).  With respect to juveniles, the probation officer has the responsibility to determine whether to release or detain offenders, Cal.Welf. & Inst.Code Ann. \u00a7 628 (West Supp.1981), and whether to institute judicial proceedings or take other supervisory steps over the minor.  \u00a7\u00a7 630, 653-654.  In carrying out these responsibilities the probation officer necessarily has a great deal of discretion that, just like that of the police officer and the teacher, must be exercised, in the first instance, without direct supervision:\n\n\n25\n\"Because the probation or parole officer's function is not so      much to compel conformance to a strict code of behavior as to      supervise a course of rehabilitation, he has been entrusted      traditionally with broad discretion to judge the progress of      rehabilitation in individual cases, and has been armed with the power to recommend or even to declare      revocation.\"  Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 784, 93      S.Ct. 1756, 1760, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973).\n\n\n26\nOne need not take an overly idealistic view of the educational functions of the probation officer during this period to recognize that the probation officer acts as an extension of the judiciary's authority to set the conditions under which particular individuals will lead their lives and of the executive's authority to coerce obedience to those conditions.14 From the perspective of the probationer, his probation officer may personify the State's sovereign powers;  from the perspective of the larger community, the probation officer may symbolize the political community's control over, and thus responsibility for, those who have been found to have violated the norms of social order.  From both of these perspectives, a citizenship requirement may seem an appropriate limitation on those who would exercise and, therefore, symbolize this power of the political community over those who fall within its jurisdiction.\n\n\n27\nTherefore, the judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n28\n\nSo ordered.\n\n\n\n29\nJustice BLACKMUN, with whom Justice BRENNAN, Justice MARSHALL, and Justice STEVENS join, dissenting.\n\n\n30\nAppellees Jose Chavez-Salido, Pedro Luis Ybarra, and Ricardo Bohorquez are American-educated Spanish-speaking lawful residents of Los Angeles County, California.1  Seven years ago, each had a modest aspiration\u2014to become a Los Angeles County \"Deputy Probation Officer, Spanish-speaking.\"  Each was willing to swear loyalty to the State and Federal Governments;  indeed, appellee Chavez-Salido declared his intent to become a citizen. By competitive examination, two of the appellees, and possibly the third, demonstrated their fitness for the jobs they desired.2 Appellants denied them those jobs solely because they were not citizens.\n\n\n31\nThe Court today concludes that appellees' exclusion from their chosen profession is \"a necessary consequence of the community's process of political self-definition.\"  Ante, at 439. The Court reaches this conclusion by misstating the standard of review it has long applied to alienage classifications.  It then asserts that a lawfully admitted permanent resident alien is disabled from serving as a deputy probation officer because that job \" 'go[es] to the heart of representative government.' \"  Ante, at 440, quoting Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U.S. 634, 647, 93 S.Ct. 2842, 2850, 37 L.Ed.2d 853 (1973).\n\n\n32\nIn my view, today's decision rewrites the Court's precedents, ignores history, defies common sense, and reinstates the deadening mantle of state parochialism in public employment.  I must dissent.\n\n\n33\n* The Court properly acknowledges that our decisions regarding state discrimination against permanent resident aliens have formed a pattern.   Ante, at 436.  Since Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886), this Court has recognized and honored the right of a lawfully admitted permanent resident alien to work for a living in the common occupations of the community.  In Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 41, 36 S.Ct. 7, 10, 60 L.Ed. 131 (1915), the Court declared that right to be\n\n\n34\n\"the very essence of the personal freedom and opportunity      that it was the purpose of the [Fourteenth] Amendment to      secure. . . .  If this could be refused solely upon the      ground of race or nationality, the prohibition of the denial      to any person of the equal protection of the laws would be a      barren form of words.\"\n\n\n35\nIn Sugarman v. Dougall, supra, we expressly refused to exempt public employment positions from this general rule.  Sugarman, an 8-1 decision, struck down as facially inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause a New York statute that excluded lawfully admitted aliens from all state civil service jobs offered on the basis of competitive examinations.  Sugarman directed that permanent resident aliens may not be barred as a class from the common public occupations of the community.  There, as here, the State had asserted its substantial interest in ensuring \"that sovereign functions must be performed by members of the State.\" Brief for Appellants in Sugarman v. Dougall, O.T. 1972, No. 71-1222, p. 10.  Without denying the weight of that interest, the Court concluded that, \"judged in the context of the State's broad statutory framework and the justifications the State present[ed],\" 413 U.S., at 640, 93 S.Ct., at 2846, the State's chosen means were insufficiently precise to uphold its broad exclusion of aliens from public employment.\n\n\n36\nSince Sugarman, the Court consistently has held that in each case where the State chooses to discriminate against permanent resident aliens, \"the governmental interest claimed to justify the discrimination is to be carefully examined in order to determine whether that interest is legitimate and substantial, and inquiry must be made whether the means adopted to achieve the goal are necessary and precisely drawn.\"  Examining Board v. Flores De Otero, 426 U.S. 572, 605, 96 S.Ct. 2264, 2282, 49 L.Ed.2d 65 (1976).  See also Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S. 1, 7, 97 S.Ct. 2120, 2124, 53 L.Ed.2d 63 (1977);  In re Griffiths, 413 U.S. 717, 721-722, 93 S.Ct. 2851, 2854-2855, 37 L.Ed.2d 910 (1973);  Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 376, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 1854, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971).  \"Alienage classifications by a State that do not withstand this stringent examination cannot stand.\"  Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S., at 7, 97 S.Ct., at 2124.\n\n\n37\nApplying this stringent standard here, I would hold that, on its face, Cal.Gov't Code Ann. \u00a7 1031(a) (West) (1980) violates the Equal Protection Clause.  Section 1031(a) makes citizenship one of six unrelated prerequisites for employment as a \"public office[r] or employe[e] declared by law to be [a] peace office[r].\"3 Scattered sections of the California Code then designate a variegated collection of public employees as \"peace officers,\" who by definition must be citizens.  When appellees first sought their jobs, the \"peace officer\" category encompassed more than 70 public occupations, including such apparently unrelated positions as toll takers, cemetery sextons, fish and game wardens, furniture and bedding inspectors, voluntary fire wardens, racetrack investigators, county coroners, State Supreme Court and Courts of Appeal bailiffs, messengers at the State Treasurer's office, and inspectors for the Board of Dental Examiners.  See Chavez-Salido v. Cabell, 427 F.Supp. 158, 169-170, n. 22 (CD Cal. 1977) (listing positions).  To this day, the legislature has offered no reason why such divergent classes of public jobs were gathered under the \"peace officer\" umbrella.4\n\n\n38\nThe history of the statute, reviewed by the District Court, suggests the answer.  Before 1961, California did not require any of its peace officers to be citizens.  See 490 F.Supp. 984, 986 (CD Cal. 1980).  Indeed, in 1851, California granted only sheriffs, policemen, marshals, and constables statutory \"peace officer\" status.  Id., at 986, n. 4.  For more than a century, the State did not reserve even those four occupations for citizens. Over the decades, dozens of subsequent enactments added other public positions to the \"peace officer\" list, but none required peace officers to be citizens.  Ibid.  Some positions were added to the list for reasons totally unrelated to logic.5\n\n\n39\nIn 1961, without stating any rationale, \"in one fell swoop, the legislature passed Government Code Section 1031 which applied the mandatory citizenship requirement to all of the positions on the list.\"  Id., at 986.  The legislature apparently made no attempt to include on the \"peace officer\" list all positions for which citizenship arguably might be relevant or to exclude all positions for which it plainly would be irrelevant.  Nine years after \u00a7 1031(a) was enacted, California's own Attorney General stated:\n\n\n40\n\"It is our opinion that . . . this citizenship requirement      can no longer validly be imposed. . . .\n\n\n41\n\"[P]rior to 1961, there was no general requirement of      citizenship to be a peace officer.  We are aware of no change      that occurred that would justify the change at that date. . .      .  [W]e are of the opinion that the classification is not      constitutionally permitted.  There does not appear to be a      compelling state interest . . . to justify classifying      certain peace officers as to alienage.\"  Opinion No. 69-199,      53 Op.Cal.Atty.Gen. 63, 67-68 (1970).\n\n\n42\nAfter reviewing this history, the District Court sensibly concluded, not once but twice, that \u00a7 1031(a) could not survive the rigorous standard of review mandated by Sugarman and its progeny.  See Chavez-Salido v. Cabell, 427 F.Supp., at 169-171; Chavez-Salido v. Cabell, 490 F.Supp., at 985-986.  Noting that the State's own legal counsel had found the statute unsupported by a compelling state interest, the District Court concluded that the California Legislature had never made a reasoned judgment to exclude aliens from each individual \"peace officer\" position. Id., at 985-987.  The District Court then found that, like the provision struck down in Sugarman, \u00a7 1031(a) \"is grossly overbroad and sweeps much too broadly in its proscription of alien employment.\"  490 F.Supp., at 987.\n\n\n43\nWithout even a glance at \u00a7 1031(a)'s history, the Court today reverses, reasoning that the District Court improperly \"applied a standard of review far stricter than that approved in Sugarman and later cases.\"   Ante, at 442.  The Court reads Sugarman to hold that \"strict scrutiny is out of place when the restriction [on lawfully resident aliens] primarily serves a political function.\"  Ante, at 439.  Based on its \"casual reading\" of the list of \"peace officer\" positions from which aliens are excluded, the Court then decides that \"the unifying character of all categories of peace officers is their law enforcement function.\"  Ante, at 443.  Conceding that \u00a7 1031(a) also bars aliens from jobs that \"may have only a tenuous connection to traditional police functions of law enforcement,\" ante, at 443, the Court nevertheless declares that alienage classifications \"need not be precise;  there need only be a substantial fit\" between the classification used and the State's asserted interest. Ante, at 442.\n\n\n44\nThe Court's analysis fundamentally distorts Sugarman.  That decision did not condone a looser standard for review of classifications barring aliens from \"political\" jobs.  In both Sugarman and Nyquist, the Court recognized that a State may name its political community by exercising its \"historical and constitutional powers to define the qualifications of voters or of 'elective or important nonelective' officials 'who participate directly in the formulation, execution, or review of broad public policy.' \"  Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S., at 11, 97 S.Ct., at 2126 (footnote omitted), quoting from Sugarman, 413 U.S., at 647, 93 S.Ct., at 2850.  At the same time, however, the Court warned that \"in seeking to achieve this substantial purpose, with discrimination against aliens, the means the State employs must be precisely drawn in light of the acknowledged purpose.\"  Id., at 643, 93 S.Ct., at 2848.\n\n\n45\nWhile the subsequent decisions in Foley v. Connelie, 435 U.S. 291, 98 S.Ct. 1067, 55 L.Ed.2d 287 (1978), and Ambach v. Norwick, 441 U.S. 68, 99 S.Ct. 1589, 60 L.Ed.2d 49 (1979), have explored the boundaries of a State's power to define its political community, those cases have not altered this stringent standard of review.  Foley tempered the declaration that a State may entrust \"its most important policy responsibilities\" to its citizens with the caveat that a State may not \"accomplish this end with a citizenship restriction that 'sweeps indiscriminately,' . . . without regard to the differences in the positions involved.\"  435 U.S., at 296 and 297, n. 5, 98 S.Ct., at 1070 and 1071, n. 5, citing Sugarman, 413 U.S., at 643, 93 S.Ct., at 2848.  Similarly, Ambach declared that judicial tolerance of citizenship requirements for essential public offices \"is an exception to the general standard applicable to classifications based on alienage.\"  441 U.S., at 75, 99 S.Ct., at 1593.\n\n\n46\nUnder the Sugarman standard, a state statute that bars aliens from political positions lying squarely within the political community nevertheless violates the Equal Protection Clause if it excludes aliens from other public jobs in an unthinking or haphazard manner.  The statutes at issue here represent just such an unthinking and haphazard exercise of state power.  The District Court found, and the Court does not deny, that some of the more than 70 \"peace officer\" positions from which aliens have been barred \"cannot be considered members of the political community no matter how liberally that category is viewed.\"  490 F.Supp., at 987.  At the same time, California has long permitted aliens to teach in public schools, to be employed on public works, and to serve in most state, city, and county employment positions\u2014all positions arguably within the political community.6\n\n\n47\nThus, exactly like the statute struck down in Sugarman, California's statutory exclusion of aliens is fatally overinclusive and underinclusive.  It bars aliens from employment in numerous public positions where the State's proffered justification has little, if any, relevance.  At the same time, it allows aliens to fill other positions that would seem naturally to fall within the State's asserted purpose.  Cf. Sugarman, 413 U.S., at 642, 93 S.Ct., at 2847.  \"Our standard of review of statutes that treat aliens differently from citizens requires a greater degree of precision.\"  Ibid.\n\n\n48\nNor can the Court reconcile its new notion of a \"substantial fit\" with the stringent standard of review the Court long has applied to alienage classifications.  Every time the State requires citizenship for a single \"peace officer\" position, it excludes permanent resident aliens from hundreds or even thousands of public jobs.  The Court's novel standard of review condones a legislative classification that excludes aliens from more than 70 public occupations although citizenship cannot be even rationally required for a substantial number of them.7  The fact that many of those positions may involve law enforcement cannot justify barring noncitizens from any of the positions that plainly do not. Today's decision thus defies the Court's earlier holdings that the States may not exclude aliens from any \"harmless and useful occupation\" for which citizenship cannot rationally be required. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S., at 374, 6 S.Ct., at 1073;  Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S., at 41, 36 S.Ct., at 10.\n\nII\n\n49\nWhile Sugarman unambiguously proscribed blanket exclusion of aliens from state jobs, its dictum acknowledged a State's power to bar noncitizens as a class from a narrowly circumscribed range of important nonelective posts involving direct participation \"in the formulation, execution, or review of broad public policy.\"  413 U.S., at 647, 93 S.Ct., at 2850.  Under Sugarman's exception, States may reserve certain public offices for their citizens if those offices \"perform functions that go to the heart of representative government.\"  Ibid.\n\n\n50\nAs originally understood, the Sugarman exception was exceedingly narrow.  Less demanding scrutiny was deemed appropriate only for statutes deriving from \"a State's historical power to exclude aliens from participation in its democratic political institutions\" or its \"constitutional responsibility for the establishment and operation of its own government.\"  Id., at 648, 93 S.Ct., at 2850.  Long before Sugarman, the Court warned that \"the power of a state to apply its laws exclusively to its alien inhabitants as a class is confined within narrow limits,\" Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm'n, 334 U.S. 410, 420, 68 S.Ct. 1138, 1143, 92 L.Ed. 1478 (1948).  In re Griffiths, 413 U.S. 717, 93 S.Ct. 2851, 37 L.Ed.2d 910 (1973), decided the same day as Sugarman, further emphasized the \"narrowness of the [Sugarman] exception\" by asserting that States could not reserve for their citizens every \"vital public and political role.\"  Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S., at 11, 97 S.Ct., at 2126, citing In re Griffiths, 413 U.S., at 729, 93 S.Ct., at 2858.\n\n\n51\nSugarman \u00a7 holding made clear that a State's power to exclude resident aliens from public occupations that entail only \"execution . . . of broad public policy\" is limited.  Sugarman, 413 U.S., at 647, 93 S.Ct., at 2850.   Foley v. Connelie, 435 U.S. 291, 98 S.Ct. 1067, 55 L.Ed.2d 287 (1978), and Ambach v. Norwick, 441 U.S. 68, 99 S.Ct. 1589, 60 L.Ed.2d 49 (1979), then clarified that public jobs involving execution, but not formulation or review, of executive and judicial policy will meet Sugarman 's exception if they constitute \"one of the basic functions of government\" and \"fulfil[l] a most fundamental obligation of government to its constituency.\"  Foley, 435 U.S., at 297, 98 S.Ct., at 1071.\n\n\n52\nEven accepting the judgments in Foley and Ambach as binding, I cannot embrace the Court's unsupported assertion that \"Foley and Ambach did not describe the outer limits of permissible citizenship requirements.\"  Ante, at 444.  From the Court's analysis in Foley and Ambach, one must conclude that a State may not invoke Sugarman \u00a7 narrow exception without making a substantial showing.8\n\n\n53\nI read Foley and Ambach to require the State to show that it has historically reserved a particular executive position for its citizens as a matter of its \"constitutional prerogativ[e].\" Sugarman, 413 U.S., at 648, 93 S.Ct., at 2850.  Furthermore, the State must demonstrate that the public employee in that position exercises plenary coercive authority and control over a substantial portion of the citizen population.  The public employee must exercise this authority over his clientele without intervening judicial or executive supervision.  Even then, the State must prove that citizenship \" 'bears some rational relationship to the special demands of the particular position.' \" Id., at 647, 93 S.Ct., at 2850, quoting Dougall v. Sugarman, 339 F.Supp. 906, 911 (SDNY 1971) (Lumbard, J., concurring).\n\n\n54\nWithout such a rigorous test, Sugarman \u00a7 exception swallows Sugarman \u00a7 rule.  Yet the Court does not apply such a rigorous test today.  Instead, it \"look[s] to the importance of the [governmental] function as a factor giving substance to the concept of democratic self-government.\"   Ante, at 441, n. 7. Applying this nebulous standard, the Court then concludes that Los Angeles County probation officers perform three \"important sovereign functions of the political community.\"  Ante, at 445. Yet on inspection, not one of those functions justifies excluding all permanent resident aliens from the deputy probation officer position.\n\n\n55\nFirst, the Court declares that probation officers \"partake of the sovereign's power to exercise coercive force over the individual.\"  Ibid.  Yet the Court concedes that \"the range of individuals over whom probation officers exercise supervisory authority is limited.\"  Ibid.  Even over those individuals, a probation officer's coercive powers are carefully conditioned by statute.  Probation officers cannot carry guns.  See 490 F.Supp., at 985, n. 2.  They may arrest only those probationers under their jurisdiction, and even then only for the purpose of bringing them before the court for a determination whether they should be held or released.  Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 1203.2 (West Supp.1981). State statutes authorize probation officers to detain juveniles only in emergencies and, even then, for only brief periods. Cal.Welf. & Inst.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 309, 313, 315 (West Supp.1981).\n\n\n56\nThe Court claims that \u00a7 1031(a) \"limit[s] the exercise of the sovereign's coercive police powers over the members of the community to citizens.\"   Ante, at 444.  Yet other statutes belie that assertion.  The State gives the power of arrest to a number of public employees who are not peace officers, but does not require that those employees be citizens.  See Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 830.7 (West Supp.1981) (describing \"[p]ersons not peace officers but having powers of arrest\").  Moreover, California authorizes any \"private person,\" including permanent resident aliens, to arrest others who have actually committed felonies or who have committed or attempted public offenses in their presence. \u00a7\u00a7 834, 837.  The Court's hollow assertion that the legislature has reserved its sovereign coercive powers for its citizens ignores the reality that the State has already bestowed some of those powers on all private persons, including aliens.\n\n\n57\nSecond, the Court asserts that probation officers necessarily have \"discretion that . . . must be exercised, in the first instance, without direct supervision.\"  Ante, at 446.  Yet to say this is to say very little.  Almost everyone who works in the government bureaucracy exercises some discretion that is unsupervised in the first instance.  The Court itself observes that probation officers have discretion primarily to investigate, to supervise, to evaluate, and to recommend.  Ibid.  Their primary duties are preparing presentence reports, supervising probationers, and recommending sentences and probationary terms. Chavez-Salido v. Cabell, 427 F.Supp., at 171.\n\n\n58\nWhile I do not denigrate these functions, neither can I equate them with the discretionary duties of policemen, judges, and jurors.  Unlike policemen, probation officers are not \"clothed with authority to exercise an almost infinite variety of discretionary powers.\"  Foley v. Connelie, 435 U.S., at 297, 98 S.Ct., at 1071.9  Unlike jurors who deliver final verdicts and judges who impose final sentences, the decisions of probation officers are always advisory to and supervised by judicial officers.  California probation officers cannot by themselves declare revocation of probation.  Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 1203.2 (West Supp.1981).  Furthermore, the investigative and reporting duties of a probation officer are extensively regulated by statute.  \u00a7\u00a7 1203.2-1203.12.  The fact that probation officers play an integral role in the criminal justice system does not separate them from prison guards, bailiffs, court clerks, and the myriad other functionaries who execute a State's judicial policy.\n\n\n59\nMore significantly, California's inflexible exclusion of aliens from deputy probation officer positions is inconsistent with its tolerance of aliens in other roles integral to the criminal justice system.  California counties apparently may appoint aliens to the positions of chief juvenile probation officer or chief adult probation officer \"if . . . the best interests of the county will be served.\"  Cal.Gov't Code Ann. \u00a7 24001 (West Supp.1981).  Furthermore, even before In re Griffiths, 413 U.S. 717, 93 S.Ct. 2851, 37 L.Ed.2d 910 (1973), the California Supreme Court had held that lawfully resident aliens may not be barred constitutionally from the practice of law.   Raffaelli v. Committee of Bar Examiners, 7 Cal.3d 288, 101 Cal.Rptr. 896, 496 P.2d 1264 (1972).  Nor are resident aliens barred from becoming California Superior Court judges or Supreme Court justices.10\n\n\n60\nThus, a criminal defendant in California may be represented at trial and on appeal by an alien attorney, have his case tried before an alien judge and appealed to an alien justice, and then have his probation supervised by a county probation department headed by an alien.  I find constitutionally absurd the Court's suggestion that the same defendant cannot be entrusted to the supervised discretion of a resident alien deputy probation officer.  In the Court's own words, a statutory scheme that tolerates such a result is sufficiently \"haphazard as to belie the State's claim that it is only attempting to ensure that an important function of government be in the hands of those having the 'fundamental legal bond of citizenship.'\"  Ante, at 442.\n\n\n61\nThe Court's third and final claim is that a probation officer acts as an actual and symbolic \"extension\" of the judiciary's authority to, 102 S.Ct. 751 set conditions of probation and the executive's authority to coerce obedience to those conditions. Ante, at 447.  Yet, by so saying, the Court simply concedes that the ultimate authority for a probation officer's acts lies elsewhere.  In Griffiths, we held that aliens are not constitutionally disabled from serving as \"officers of the court.\" 413 U.S., at 722-727, 93 S.Ct., at 2855-2857.  Given the size of the State's judicial and executive bureaucracy, little would be left of Sugarman \u00a7 holding if a State could invoke the Sugarman exception to exclude probation officers from any position which \"extended\" judicial or executive authority.11\n\n\n62\nNor am I convinced by the Court's claim that a probation officer personifies the State's sovereign powers in the eyes of probationers and the larger community.  This justification knows no limit.  Surely a taxpayer feels the State's sovereign power when the local tax collector comes to his door;  the larger community recognizes the sovereign power of the government when local firefighters put out a fire.  The State could not also demand citizenship for those jobs, however, without thoroughly eviscerating Sugarman.  Nor does the Court deny that the sight of foreign-born individuals not merely following, but encouraging others to follow, our laws is an equally powerful symbol of respect for our society's social norms.\n\n\n63\nIn the end, the State has identified no characteristic of permanent resident aliens as a class which disables them from performing the job of deputy probation officer.  Cf. Foley v. Connelie, 435 U.S., at 308, 98 S.Ct., at 1077 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).  The State does not dispute that these appellees possess the qualifications and educational background to perform the duties that job entails.  See nn. 1 and 2, supra.  Indeed, the State advances no rational reason why these appellees, native Spanish-speakers with graduate academic degrees, are not superbly qualified to act as probation officers for Spanish-speaking probationers, some of whom themselves may not be citizens.  Cf. Ambach v. Norwick, 441 U.S., at 84, 87-88, 99 S.Ct., at 1598, 1600 (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n64\nThe State cannot challenge the appellees' lack of familiarity with local laws or rules.  Such a consideration might disqualify nonresident citizens, but not permanent resident aliens who have lived in California for much of their lives.  Nor can the State presume that aliens as a class would be less loyal to the State. The Court's rulings in In re Griffiths, 413 U.S., at 726, n. 18, 93 S.Ct., at 2857, n. 18, and Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U.S. 88, 111, n. 43, 96 S.Ct. 1895, 1909, n. 43, 48 L.Ed.2d 495 (1976), clearly state that one need not be a citizen in order to swear in good conscience to support the Constitution.  When these appellees applied for their jobs, they expressed their willingness to take such oaths.  One later declared his intent to become, and then became, a citizen.  See 490 F.Supp., at 985, n. 2.  Finally, the State cannot claim that by enacting \u00a7 1031(a), it seeks to encourage aliens to become citizens.  That objective is an exclusively federal interest. Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S., at 10-11, 97 S.Ct., at 2125-2126.\n\n\n65\nI only can conclude that California's exclusion of these appellees from the position of deputy probation officer stems solely from state parochialism and hostility toward foreigners who have come to this country lawfully.  I find it ironic that the Court invokes the principle of democratic self-government to exclude from the law enforcement process individuals who have not only resided here lawfully, but who now desire merely to help the State enforce its laws.  Section 1031(a) violates appellees' rights to equal treatment and an individualized determination of fitness.\n\n\n66\nI would affirm the District Court's ruling that \u00a7 1031(a) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied.\n\n\n\n1\n One of the appellees, Chavez-Salido, subsequently became a citizen.  By that time, however, there were no longer any openings for the job he had previously been denied on the grounds of his noncitizenship.  Appellees, at the time they applied for the positions in question, were all lawfully present, resident aliens. Therefore, we do not consider, and intimate no opinion about, any limits the Constitution may place upon state action directed at aliens who are here without the permission of the Federal Government or who, if legally here, are not residents of the State.\n\n\n2\n Under the California statute, the kinds of responsibilities of deputy probation officers are the same as those of probation officers and both are considered \"peace officers.\"  Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 830.5 (West Supp.1981).  This opinion, therefore, will refer simply to \"probation officers\" in discussing the positions at issue.\n\n\n3\n The third appellee, Bohorquez, claimed only that he failed to appeal a test score that disqualified him, because he had been informed that without citizenship an appeal would be useless.  As relief in this suit, Bohorquez sought only an opportunity to take a new examination.\n\n\n4\n Although the individual defendants did not contest the jurisdiction of the federal court, the county did.  In their complaint, appellees waived any claim against the county under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\u2014the complaint was filed before this Court's decision in Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), which held that such an action could be brought against a county.  Appellees argued, and the District Court agreed, that they did have a claim against the county directly under the Fourteenth Amendment and under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, with jurisdiction in the Federal District Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a) because there was more than $10,000 in controversy.  In its second opinion, the District Court readopted its earlier jurisdictional holdings and declined to release appellees from their previous waiver of a possible claim against the county under \u00a7 1983.  Given our resolution of the merits and because jurisdiction over the individual defendants is clear, we need not evaluate or otherwise accept the District Court's jurisdictional findings with respect to the county.\n\n\n5\n Congress has since limited the availability of three-judge courts, The Three-Judge Court Amendments of 1976, Pub.L. 94-381, 90 Stat. 1119.  This case, however, is not affected by those changes, which do not apply to actions commenced before the date of the new statute's enactment.\n\n\n6\n At times the dissent seems to imply that our cases do not establish a two-tiered standard of review\u2014e.g., \"[Sugarman] did not condone a looser standard for review of classifications barring aliens from 'political jobs.' \"  Post, at 453.  At other times, however, the dissent explicitly refers to the \"Sugarman exception\" as requiring \"[l]ess demanding scrutiny . . . for statutes deriving from 'a State's historical power to exclude aliens from participation in its democratic political institutions.' \"  Post, at 456.\n\n\n7\n The full quotation from Sugarman is as follows:\n\" '[E]ach State has the power to prescribe the qualifications of its officers and the manner in which they shall be chosen.' Boyd v. Nebraska ex rel. Thayer, 143 U.S. 135, 161 [12 S.Ct. 375, 382, 36 L.Ed. 103] (1892).  See Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 41 [12 L.Ed. 581] (1849);  Pope v. Williams, 193 U.S. 621, 632-633 [24 S.Ct. 573, 575, 48 L.Ed. 817] (1904).  Such power inheres in the State by virtue of its obligation, already noted above, 'to preserve the basic conception of a political community.'  Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. [330], at 344 [92 S.Ct. 995, at 1004, 31 L.Ed.2d 274].  And this power and responsibility of the State applies, not only to the qualifications of voters, but also to persons holding state elective or important nonelective executive, legislative, and judicial positions, for officers who 'participate directly in the formulation, execution, or review of broad public policy perform functions that go to the heart of representative government.' \"  413 U.S., at 647, 93 S.Ct., at 2850.\nThis language is far reaching and no limits on it were suggested by Sugarman itself:  almost every governmental official can be understood as participating in the execution of broad public policies.  The limits on this category within which citizenship is relevant to the political community are not easily defined, but our cases since Sugarman\u2014Foley v. Connelie, 435 U.S. 291, 98 S.Ct. 1067, 55 L.Ed.2d 287 (1978), and Ambach v. Norwick, 441 U.S. 68, 99 S.Ct. 1589, 60 L.Ed.2d 49 (1979)\u2014suggest that this Court will not look to the breadth of policy judgments required of a particular employee.  Rather, the Court will look to the importance of the function as a factor giving substance to the concept of democratic self-government.\n\n\n8\n Both the District Court and the parties mistakenly refer to this argument as one based on the constitutional doctrine of \"overbreadth.\"  \"Overbreadth\" is a doctrine of standing applicable in certain First Amendment cases and under which litigants may assert the rights of others not presently before the court.  See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 611-615, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2915-2917, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973).  Appellees do not claim to be asserting the constitutional rights of others;  rather, they claim that California denies them the equal protection of the laws because the restriction is so overinclusive that it destroys the State's asserted justification.\n\n\n9\n It is worth noting, however, that of the categories mentioned by the District Court, toll-service employees, inspectors of the Bureau of Livestock, and cemetery sextons were all eliminated from coverage by amendments to Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 830.4 (West Supp.1981), passed in 1980.  1980 Cal.Stats., ch. 1340, p. 4724, \u00a7 12, effective Sept. 30, 1980.\n\n\n10\n The dissent specifically questions only four positions. Post, at 455, n. 7.  Three of these\u2014Dental Board Inspectors, Parks and Recreation Department employees, and voluntary fire wardens\u2014are designated \"peace officers\" only when their \"primary duty\" is law enforcement.  See Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 830.3(b), (c), (j) (West Supp.1981).\n\n\n11\n The dissent accuses the Court of holding that the law enforcement character of some of the covered positions justifies application of the citizenship restriction to unrelated positions. Post, at 455.  We indicate no opinion as to whether noncitizen applicants for other positions could successfully challenge the statute as applied to them.\n\n\n12\n Appellees also argue that the statute is facially invalid because it is impermissibly underinclusive.  The District Court did not consider this contention, and the only argument advanced by appellees in support of this claim is that California fails to impose a citizenship requirement upon its public school teachers. Brief for Appellees 29.  At various points, the dissent also relies upon the alleged underinclusiveness of the statute.\nAlthough there is some language in Sugarman indicating that such an argument is appropriate, 413 U.S., at 640, 642, 93 S.Ct., at 2846, 2847, and that a statutory exclusion of aliens from a particular form of public employment will be evaluated in light of the entire framework of public employment positions open and closed to aliens, clearly our subsequent cases have not adopted that position.  Thus, in both Foley and Ambach only the specific governmental functions directly at issue were considered. Underinclusiveness arguments were relevant in Sugarman because there the classification involved\u2014the competitive civil service swept in a wide variety of governmental functions.  Such a sweeping and apparently indiscriminate categorization raises legitimate questions of arbitrariness that are not raised when the State limits a particular and important governmental function e.g., coercive police power\u2014to citizens.  When we deal with such a specific category, underinclusiveness arguments are relevant only within the category:  Are there, for example, individuals who exercise the State's coercive police power that are not required to be citizens?  In this respect, the California statutory scheme is not substantially underinclusive:  Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 830.7 (West Supp.1981) lists only two categories of positions which have the power to arrest but are not \"peace officers\"\u2014and therefore are not subject to the citizenship requirement\u2014security officers at institutions of higher education and certain individuals designated by a cemetery authority.\n\n\n13\n Measuring the scope of community contacts is more difficult than it may appear.  Although the probation officer has responsibility for only a relatively small part of the community, in exercising that responsibility the probation officer necessarily comes in contact with a much broader section of the community.  His supervisory responsibilities will bring him into contact with many of those with whom those under his supervision must interact\u2014e.g., employers, teachers, landlords, and family. In this respect he is very much like a policeman, who exercises his coercive authority over a small class of individuals, but carries out his responsibilities through interactions with a much larger segment of the community.\n\n\n14\n Thus we do not find compelling the statistics presented by amicus Service Employees International Union, and cited by appellees at oral argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 40, which indicate that because of a growing caseload, the time a probation officer has to spend with any individual offender may be minimal.\n\n\n1\n Chavez-Salido, born in Mexico, has been a permanent legal resident of this country for 26 years.  He has received all his formal education in California, including a Bachelor of Arts degree in Mexican-American studies from California State College at Long Beach.\nYbarra, born in Spain, has been a permanent resident of this country since 1972.  He possesses a Bachelor of Arts degree in theology from Camillas University in Spain, and a Master of Arts degree in African Studies from the University of California at Los Angeles.  He is working for another Master's degree, in sociology, at California State University at Northridge.\nBohorquez, born in Colombia, has been a permanent resident of this country since 1961.  He has a Bachelor of Arts degree in Latin-American studies from the University of California at Los Angeles.  App. 19-23.\n\n\n2\n Chavez-Salido scored 95 out of 100 on a qualifying oral examination for the Deputy Probation Officer (DPO) II, Spanish-speaking, position and 100 out of 100 on the oral examination for the DPO Trainee position, but was offered neither job solely because of his citizenship.  Ybarra was denied employment after passing examinations for the DPO Trainee and DPO II positions.  Bohorquez did not pass his initial oral examination for DPO II, but did not appeal his examination results after appellants told him his alienage made an appeal useless.  Id., at 19-24.\n\n\n3\n Section 1031(a) provides that a peace officer must be at least 18, fingerprinted, of good moral character, a high school graduate (or the equivalent thereof), physically and mentally healthy, and \"a citizen of the United States.\"\n\n\n4\n After this litigation began, and the District Court had twice declared \u00a7 1031(a) unconstitutional, the California Legislature twice amended sections of its Penal Code, removing some positions from the \"peace officer\" list and adding others. See 490 F.Supp. 984, 986-987, n. 6 (CD Cal. 1980) (listing additions to and deletions from the peace officer list).  See also 1980 Cal.Stats., ch. 1340, effective Sept. 30, 1980 (same).  The legislature still has never declared what criteria it uses to decide whether a particular government position deserves \"peace officer\" status.\n\n\n5\n A judge of the California Court of Appeal once noted:\n\"No mystery surrounds extension of the traditional definition of peace officer to such an unrecognizable degree by the Legislature.  The Legislature must respond to the interests of various groups.  Correctional officers, for example, were granted the status of 'peace officers' in order that they may obtain better group insurance benefits. . . .  [B]ecause peace officers appear to have enjoyed better benefits in times past, many employee groups, even tangentially associated with the role of peace officers, have persuaded the Legislature to include them within the term 'peace officer.' \"  Hetherington v. State Personnel Bd., 82 Cal.App.3d 582, 600, 147 Cal.Rptr. 300, 311 (1978) (Reynoso, J., dissenting).\n\n\n6\n See Purdy & Fitzpatrick v. State, 71 Cal.2d 566, 79 Cal.Rptr. 77, 456 P.2d 645 (1969) (invalidating citizenship requirement for employment on public works);  1970 Cal.Stats., ch. 653, p. 1277, \u00a7 1, repealing Art. 2, ch. 2, Pt. 7, Div. 2, Cal.Lab.Code Ann. \u00a7 1940 (West 1955) (former citizenship requirement for employment in any department of the State or of any county or city).  See generally Comment, The California Exclusion of Permanent Resident Aliens from Appointive Public Office, 11 C.W.L.R. 117, 126-131 (1974) (listing California governmental positions from which permanent resident aliens have and have not been excluded).\n\n\n7\n The Court cannot seriously argue, for example, that the positions of Dental Board inspector, messenger in the State Treasurer's office, Parks and Recreations Department employee, and volunteer fire warden represent \"important nonelective positions,\" see Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U.S. 634, 647, 93 S.Ct. 2842, 2850, 37 L.Ed.2d 853 (1973), of the type the States historically or constitutionally have reserved for their citizens.  Yet even after the legislature's latest amendments, all remain \"peace officer\" positions from which aliens are excluded by \u00a7 1031(a).\n\n\n8\n In Foley v. Connelie, the Court held that the State may require policemen to be citizens because they are \"clothed with\" what are described as \"plenary discretionary powers.\"  435 U.S., at 297-298, 98 S.Ct., at 1071.  Policemen exercise those powers \"over people generally\" as part of their \"pervasive\" presence in modern society.  Id., at 297-299, 98 S.Ct., at 1071-1072.  Because policemen often act \"without prior judicial authority,\" they require a grant of \"prophylactic authority\" from the State.  Id., at 298, 98 S.Ct., at 1071.  Exercise of that authority demands a \"very high degree of judgment and discretion, the abuse or misuse of which can have serious impact on individuals.\"  Ibid.\nAmbach v. Norwick, held that a State may bar aliens who have not declared their intent to become citizens from teaching in public schools because teachers perform a similarly significant \"governmental function.\"  Schoolteachers, Ambach noted, possess a high \"degree of responsibility and discretion\" which they exercise to fulfill the government's basic obligation to provide public education.  441 U.S., at 75, 99 S.Ct., at 1593.  Furthermore, teachers have \"direct, day-to-day contact\" with their students, exercise unsupervised discretion over them, act as role models, and influence their students' attitudes about the government and the political process.  Id., at 78-79, 99 S.Ct., at 1595-1596.\n\n\n9\n Nor can the Court argue by analogy to Ambach v. Norwick, 441 U.S. 68, 99 S.Ct. 1589, 60 L.Ed.2d 49 (1979), that probation officers, like teachers, influence their probationers' \"attitudes . . . toward government, the political process, and a citizen's social responsibilities.\"  Id., at 79, 99 S.Ct., at 1596.  Such an assertion would ignore the reality of a modern probation officer's life.\nIn 1973, the average federal probation officer supervised nearly 100 offenders.  Federal Judicial Center, Probation Time Study 3 (Feb. 26, 1973).  Each offender under supervision was accorded between six and eight hours of supervision from his probation officer in a year, or seven to nine minutes per week. Ibid.  It blinks reality to suggest that a probation officer subject to these pressures has either the time or the inclination to give his probationers lessons in civics.\n\n\n10\n Until 1966, Cal.Gov't Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 69500, 68804 required that Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices be citizens. In 1967, however, those provisions were repealed.  1967 Cal.Stats., ch. 17, pp. 841, 845, \u00a7\u00a7 61, 87.  As a result, the only remaining restriction on becoming a judge in California is membership in the state bar for a certain number of years. Cal.Const., Art. VI, \u00a7 15.  After the California Supreme Court's decision in Raffaelli, aliens became eligible for the bar and, hence, to become judges.\n\n\n11\n The Court concedes as much when it notes that \"almost every governmental official can be understood as participating in the execution of broad public policies.\"  Ante, at 441, n. 7.\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"416 U.S. 637\n94 S.Ct. 1868\n40 L.Ed.2d 431\nRobert H. DONNELLY, Petitioner,v.Benjamin A. DeCHRISTOFORO.\nNo. 72\u20141570.\nArgued Feb. 20, 1974.\nDecided May 13, 1974.\n\nSyllabus\nDuring the course of a joint first-degree murder trial, respondent's codefendant pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, of which the trial court advised the jury, stating that the trial against respondent would continue. In his summation, the prosecutor stated that respondent and his counsel had said that they 'hope that you find him not guilty. I quite frankly think that they hope that you find him guilty of something a little less than first-degree murder.' Respondent's counsel objected and later sought an instruction that the remark was improper and should be disregarded. In its instructions, the trial court, after re-emphasizing the prosecutor's statement that his argument was not evidence, declared that the challenged remark was unsupported, and admonished the jury to ignore it. Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder. The State's highest court ruled that the prosecutor's remark, though improper, was not so prejudicial as to warrant a mistrial and that the trial court's instruction sufficed to safeguard respondent's rights. The District Court denied respondent's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the challenged comment implied that respondent, like his codefendant, had offered to plead guilty to a lesser offense, but was refused and that the comment was thus potentially so misleading and prejudicial as to deprive respondent of a constitutionally fair trial. Held: In the circumstances of this case, where the prosecutor's ambiguous remark in the course of an extended trial was followed by the trial court's specific disapproving instructions, no prejudice amounting to a denial of constitutional due process was shown. Miller v. Pate, 386 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 785, 17 L.Ed.2d 690; Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 distinguished. Pp. 642\u2014648.\n1st Cir., 473 F.2d 1236, reversed.\nDavid A. Mills, Danvers, Mass., for petitioner.\nPaul T. Smith, Boston, Mass., for respondent.\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nRespondent was tried before a jury in Massachusetts Superior Court and convicted of first-degree murder.1 The jury recommended that the death penalty not be imposed, and respondent was sentenced to life imprisonment. He appealed to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts contending, inter alia, that certain of the prosecutor's remarks during closing argument deprived him of his constitutional right to a fair trial. The Supreme Judicial Court affirmed.2 That court acknowledged that the prosecutor had made improper remarks, but determined that they were not so prejudicial as to require reversal.\n\n\n2\nRespondent then sought habeas corpus relief in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The District Court denied relief, stating: '(T)he prosecutor's arguments were not so prejudicial as to deprive (DeChristoforo of his constitutional right to a fair trial.'3 The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed by a divided vote.4 The majority held that the prosecutor's remarks deliberately conveyed the false impression that respondent had unsuccessfully sought to plead to a lesser charge and that this conduct was a denial of due process. We granted certiorari, 414 U.S. 974, 94 S.Ct. 273, 38 L.Ed.2d 216 (1973), to consider whether such remarks, in the context of the entire trial, were sufficiently prejudicial to violate respondent's due process rights. We hold they were not and so reverse.\n\n\n3\n* Respondent and two companions were indicted for the first-degree murder of Joseph Lanzi, a passenger in the car in which the defendants were riding. Police had stopped the car at approximately 4 a.m. on April 18, 1967, and had discovered Lanzi's dead body along with two firearms, one of which had been fired. A second gun, also recently fired, was found a short distance away. Respondent and one companion avoided apprehension at that time, but the third defendant was taken into custody. He later pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.\n\n\n4\nRespondent and the other defendant, Gagliardi, were finally captured and tried jointly. The prosecutor made little claim that respondent fired any shots but argued that he willingly assisted in the killing. Respondent, on the other hand, maintained that he was an innocent passenger. At the close of the evidence but before final argument, Gagliardi elected to plead guilty to a charge of second-degree murder. The court advised the jury that Gagliardi had pleaded guilty and that respondent's trial would continue.5 Respondent did not seek an instruction that the jury was to draw no inference from the plea, and no such instruction was given.\n\n\n5\nRespondent's claims of constitutional error focus on two remarks made by the prosecutor during the course of his rather lengthy closing argument to the jury. The first involved the expression of a personal opinion as to guilt,6 perhaps offered to rebut a somewhat personalized argument by respondent's counsel. The majority of the Court of Appeals agreed with the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts that this remark was improper, but declined to rest its holding of a violation of due process on that remark.7 It turned to a second remark that it deemed 'more serious.'\n\n\n6\nThe prosecutor's second challenged comment was directed at respondent's motives in standing trial: 'They (the respondent and his counsel) said they hope that you find him not guilty. I quite frankly think that they hope that you find him guilty of something a little less than first-degree murder.'8 Respondent's counsel objected immediately to the statement and later sought an instruction that the remark was improper and should be disregarded.9 The court then gave the following instruction:\n\n\n7\n'Closing arguments are not evidence for your consideration. .      . .\n\n\n8\n'Now in his closing, the District Attorney, I noted, made a      statement: 'I don't know what they want you to do by way of a      verdict. They said they hope that you find him not guilty. I      quite frankly think that they hope that you find him guilty      of something a little less than first-degree murder.' There      is no evidence of that whatsoever, of course, you are      instructed to disregard that statement made by the District      Attorney.\n\n\n9\n'Consider the case as though no such statement was made.'10\n\n\n10\nThe majority of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, though again not disputing that the remark was improper, held that it was not so prejudicial as to require a mistrial and further stated that the trial judge's instruction 'was sufficient to safeguard the defendant's rights.'11 Despite this decision and the District Court's denial of a writ of habeas corpus, the Court of Appeals found that the comment was potentially so misleading and prejudicial that it deprived respondent of a constitutionally fair trial.\n\n\n11\nThe Court of Appeals reasoned that the jury would be naturally curious about respondent's failure to plead guilty and that this curiosity would be heightened by Gagliardi's decision to plead guilty at the close of the evidence. In this context, the court thought, the prosecutor's comment that respondent hoped for conviction on a lesser offense would suggest to the jury that respondent had sought to plead guilty but had been refused. Since the prosecutor was in a position to know such facts, the jury may well have surmised that respondent had already admitted guilt in an attempt to secure reduced charges. This, said the Court of Appeals, is the inverse of, but a parallel to, intentional suppression of favorable evidence. The prosecutor had deliberately misled the jury, and even if the statement was made thoughtlessly, 'in a first degree murder case there must be some duty on a prosecutor to be thoughtful.'12 Therefore, the District Court had erred in denying respondent's petition.\n\nII\n\n12\nThe Court of Appeals in this case noted, as petitioner urged, that its review was 'the narrow one of due process, and not the broad exercise of supervisory power that (it) would possess in regard to (its) own trial court.'13 We regard this observation as important for not every trial error or infirmity which might call for application of supervisory powers correspondingly constitutes a 'failure to observe that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept of justice.' Lisenba v. California, 314 U.S. 219, 236, 62 S.Ct. 280, 290, 86 L.Ed. 166 (1941). We stated only this Term in Cupp. v. Naughten, 414 U.S. 141, 94 S.Ct. 396, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973), when reviewing an instruction given in a state court:\n\n\n13\n'Before a federal court may overturn a conviction resulting from a state trial in which this instruction was      used, it must be established not merely that the instruction      is undesirable, erroneous, or even 'universally condemned,'      but that it violated some right which was guaranteed to the      defendant by the Fourteenth Amendment.'14\n\n\n14\nThis is not a case in which the State has denied a defendant the benefit of a specific provision of the Bill of Rights, such as the right to counsel, Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25, 92 S.Ct. 2006, 32 L.Ed.2d 530 (1972), or in which the prosecutor's remarks so prejudiced a specific right, such as the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, as to amount to a denial of that right. Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965).15 When specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights are involved, this Court has taken special care to assure that prosecutorial conduct in no way impermissibly infringes them. But here the claim is only that a prosecutor's remark about respondent's expectations at trial by itself so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. We do not believe that examination of the entire proceedings in this case supports that contention.\n\n\n15\nConflicting inferences have been drawn from the prosecutor's statement by the courts below. Although the Court of Appeals stated flatly that 'the prosecuting attorney turned Gagliardi's plea into a telling stroke against (DeChristoforo)'16 by implying respondent had offered to plead guilty as well, the dissent found the inference to be 'far less obvious.'17 The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts stated that it considered the same argument illogical:\n\n\n16\n'It is not logical to conclude that the jury would accept any      implied argument of the prosecutor that, because one of the      men whom the defendant blamed for the murder had pleaded      guilty, the defendant was any less firm in his assertion that      he himself was not guilty of any crime whatsoever.'18\n\n\n17\nThus it is by no means clear that the jury did engage in the hypothetical analysis suggested by the majority of the Court of Appeals, or even probable that it would seize such a comment out of context and attach this particular meaning to it. Five Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts and at least one federal judge have all confessed difficulty in making this speculative connection.\n\n\n18\nIn addition, the trial court took special pains to correct any impression that the jury could consider the prosecutor's statements as evidence in the case. The prosecutor, as is customary, had previously told the jury that his argument was not evidence,19 and the trial judge specifically re-emphasized that point. Then the judge directed the jury's attention to the remark particularly challenged here, declared it to be unsupported, and admonished the jury to ignore it.20 Although some occurrences at trial may be too clearly prejudicial for such a curative instruction to mitigate their effect, the comment in this case is hardly of such character.\n\n\n19\nIn Cupp v. Naughten, supra, the respondent had challenged his conviction on the ground that a 'presumption of truthfulness' instruction, given by the state trial court, had deprived him of the presumption of innocence and had shifted the State's burden of proof to himself. Holding that the instruction, although perhaps not advisable, did not violate due process, we stated:\n\n\n20\n'In determining the effect of this instruction on the      validity of respondent's conviction, we accept at the outset      the well-established proposition that a single instruction to      a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be      viewed in the context of the overall charge. Boyd v. United      States, 271 U.S. 104, 107 (46 S.Ct. 442, 443, 70 L.Ed. 857)      (1926). While this does not mean that an instruction by      itself may never rise to the level of constitutional error,      see Cool v. United States, 409 U.S. 100 (93 S.Ct. 354, 34      L.Ed.2d 335) (1972), it does recognize that a judgment of      conviction is commonly the culmination of a trial which      includes testimony of witnesses, argument of counsel, receipt      of exhibits in evidence, and instruction of the jury by the      judge. Thus not only is the challenged instruction but one of      many such instructions, but the process of instruction itself      is but one of several components of the trial which may      result in the judgment of conviction.'21\n\n\n21\nSimilarly, the prosecutor's remark here, admittedly an ambiguous one, was but one moment in an extended trial and was followed by specific disapproving instructions. Although the process of constitutional line drawing in this regard is necessarily imprecise, we simply do not believe that this incident made respondent's trial so fundamentally unfair as to deny him due process.\n\nIII\n\n22\nWe do not find the cases cited by the Court of Appeals to require a different result. In Miller v. Pate, 386 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 785, 17 L.Ed.2d 690 (1967), the principal case relied upon, this Court held that a state prisoner was entitled to federal habeas relief upon a showing that a pair of stained undershorts, allegedly belonging to the prisoner and repeatedly described by the State during trial as stained with blood, was in fact stained with paint. In the course of its opinion, this Court said:\n\n\n23\n'It was further established that counsel for the prosecution      had known at the time of the trial that the shorts were      stained with paint. . . .\n\n\n24\n'. . . The record of the petitioner's trial reflects the      prosecution's consistent and repeated misrepresentation that      People's Exhibit 3 was, indeed, 'a garment heavily stained      with blood.\" Id., at 6, 87 S.Ct., at 787.\n\n\n25\nA long series of decisions of this Court,22 of course, had established the proposition that the 'Fourteenth Amendment cannot tolerate a state criminal conviction obtained by the knowing use of false evidence.' Id., at 7, 87 S.Ct., at 788. The Court in Miller found those cases controlling.\n\n\n26\nWe countenance no retreat from that proposition in observing that it falls far short of embracing the prosecutor's remark in this case. The 'consistent and repeated misrepresentation' of a dramatic exhibit in evidence may profoundly impress a jury and may have a significant impact on the jury's deliberations. Isolated passages of a prosecutor's argument, billed in advance to the jury as a matter of opinion not of evidence, do not reach the same proportions. Such arguments, like all closing arguments of counsel, are seldom carefully constructed in toto before the event; improvisation frequently results in syntax left imperfect and meaning less than crystal clear. While these general observations in no way justify prosecutorial misconduct, they do suggest that a court should not lightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning or that a jury, sitting through lengthy exhortation, will draw that meaning from the plethora of less damaging interpretations.\n\n\n27\nThe Court of Appeals' reliance on Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1973), is likewise misplaced. In Brady, the prosecutor had withheld evidence, a statement by the petitioner's codefendant, which was directly relevant to the extent of the petitioner's involvement in the crime. Since the petitioner had testified that his codefendant had done the actual shooting and since the petitioner's counsel was not contesting guilt but merely seeking to avoid the death penalty, evidence of the degree of the petitioner's participation was highly significant to the primary jury issue. As in Miller, manipulation of the evidence by the prosecution was likely to have an important effect on the jury's determination. But here there was neither the introduction of specific misleading evidence important to the prosecution's case in chief nor the nondisclosure of specific evidence valuable to the accused's defense. There were instead a few brief sentences in the prosecutor's long and expectably hortatory closing argument which might or might not suggest to a jury that the respondent had unsuccessfully sought to bargain for a lesser charge. We find nothing in Brady to suggest that due process is so easily denied.\n\n\n28\nThe result reached by the Court of Appeals in this case leaves virtually meaningless the distinction between ordinary trial error of a prosecutor and that sort of egregious misconduct held in Miller and Brady, supra, to amount to a denial of constitutional due process.23 Since we believe that distinction should continue to be observed, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n29\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n30\nReversed.\n\n\n31\nMr. Justice STEWART, with whom Mr. Justice WHITE joins (concurring).\n\n\n32\nI agree with my Brother Douglas that, when no new principle of law is presented, we should generally leave undisturbed the decision of a court of appeals that upon the particular facts of any case habeas corpus relief should be granted\u2014or denied. For this reason I think it was a mistake to grant a writ of certiorari in this case, and I would now dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.\n\n\n33\nWe are bound here, however, by the 'rule of four.' That rule ordains that the votes of four Justices are enough to grant certiorari and bring a case before the Court for decision on the merits. If as many as four Justices remain so minded after oral argument, due adherence to that rule requires me to address the merits of a case, however strongly I may feel that it does not belong in this Court. See Ferguson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, 352 U.S. 521, 559, 77 S.Ct. 459, 478, 1 L.Ed.2d 515 (separate opinion of Harlan, J.).\n\n\n34\nUpon this premise, I join the Court's opinion.\n\n\n35\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS (dissenting).\n\n\n36\nThe function of the prosecutor under the Federal Constitution is not to tack as many skins of victims as possible to the wall. His function is to vindicate the right of people as expressed in the laws and give those accused of crime a fair trial. As stated by the Court in Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed. 1314:\n\n\n37\n'The United States Attorney is the representative not of an      ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose      obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its      obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore,      in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case,      but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar      and very definite sense the servant of the law, the two-fold      aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence      suffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor\u2014indeed,      he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is      not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to      refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a      wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to      bring about a just one.'\n\n\n38\nWe have here a state case, not a federal one; and the prosecutor is a state official. But we deal with an aspect of a fair trial which is implicit in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by which the States are bound. Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297; Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600; Turner v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 466, 85 S.Ct. 546, 13 L.Ed.2d 424; Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 6 L.Ed.2d 751.\n\n\n39\nIn this case respondent was charged with first-degree murder and was convicted in the state court by a jury. At no time did he seek to plead guilty to a lesser offense. It is stipulated:\n\n\n40\n'(A)t no time did defendant seek to plead guilty to any      offense; at no time did the Commonwealth seek to solicit or offer to accept a plea; and at all times      defendant insisted upon a trial.'\n\n\n41\nA codefendant pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and the jury was advised of the fact.\n\n\n42\nAs to the guilt of respondent the prosecutor told the jury: 'I honestly and sincerely believe that there is no doubt in this case, none whatsoever.'\n\n\n43\nAnd he went on to say: 'I quite frankly think that they hope that you find him guilty of something a little less than first-degree murder.'\n\n\n44\nThese statements in the setting of the case and in light of the fact that the jury knew the codefendant had pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, are a subtle equivalent of a statement by the prosecutor that respondent sought a lesser penalty. Counsel for respondent immediately objected but the court at the time did not admonish the prosecutor or tell the jury to disregard the statement, though it did cover the matter later in its general instructions.\n\n\n45\n* As a matter of federal law the introduction of a withdrawn plea of guilty is not admissible evidence, Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220, 47 S.Ct. 582, 71 L.Ed. 1009. As a matter of procedural due process the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, applicable to the States by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment, pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923, would bar a person from testifying that the defendant had sought a guilty plea unless the right of cross-examination of the witness was afforded, id., at 406\u2014408, 85 S.Ct., at 1069\u20141070. That requirement of procedural due process should be sedulously enforced (save for the recognized exceptions of dying declarations and the like, id., 407, 85 S.Ct., at 1069\u20141070) lest the theory that the end justifies the means gains further footholds here. The prosecutor is not a witness; and he should not be permitted to add to the record either by subtle or gorss improprieties. Those who have experienced the full thrust of the power of government when leveled against them know that the only protection the citizen has is in the requirement for a fair trial. The assurance of the Court that we make no retreat from constitutional government by today's decision has therefore a hollow ring.\n\n\n46\nActivist judges have brought federal habeas corpus into disrepute at the present time. It is guaranteed by the Constitution. It is a built-in restraint on judges\u2014both state and federal; and it is also a restraint on prosecutors who are officers of the court. Our activist tendencies should promote not law and order, but constitutional law and order. Judges, too, can be tyrants and often have been. Prosecutors are often eager to take almost any shortcut to win, yet as I have said they represent not an ordinary party but We the People. As I have noted, their duty is as much 'to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one,' Berger v. United States, surpa, 295 U.S., at 88, 55 S.Ct. at 633.\n\n\n47\nIt is, I submit, quite 'improper' for a prosecutor to insinuate to the jury the existence of evidence not in the record and which could not be introduced without the privilege of cross-examination.\n\nII\n\n48\nThe Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts had difficulty with this case when it came before it on direct appeal, two Justices, which included the Chief Justice, dissenting,* Commonwealth v. DeChristoforo, 360 Mass., 531, 277 N.E.2d 100. The Court of Appeals was also divided, 473 F.2d 1236. Our federal district courts and courts of appeals are much closer to law administration in the respective States than are we in Washington, D.C. They are responsible federal judges who know the Federal Constitution as well as we do. Their error in issuing the Great Writ\u2014or in refusing to do so\u2014would in my judgment have to be egregious for us to grant a petition for certiorari. When a Court of Appeals honors the Constitution by granting the Great Writ or in its solemn judgment denies it, we should let the matter rest there, save for manifest error.\n\n\n49\nI would affirm the judgment below.\n\n\n50\nMr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice MARSHALL would affirm the judgment below for the reasons stated in Part II of the dissent of Mr. Justice DOUGLAS.\n\n\n\n1\n Respondent and his codefendants were also indicted for illegal possession of firearms, and respondent received a four- to five-year sentence on that charge. The conviction is in on way related to the issues before the Court in this case.\n\n\n2\n Commonwealth v. DeChristoforo, 360 Mass. 531, 277 N.E.2d 100 (1971).\n\n\n3\n App. 231.\n\n\n4\n 473 F.2d 1236 (1973).\n\n\n5\n The trial court stated:\n'Mr. Foreman, madam and gentlemen of the jury. You will notice that the defendant Gagliardi is not in the dock. He has pleaded 'guilty,' and his case has been disposed of.\n'We will, therefore, go forward with the trial of the case of Commonwealth vs DeChristoforo.' App. 99.\n\n\n6\n The challenged remark was: 'I honestly and sincerely believe that there is no doubt in this case, none whatsoever.' Id., at 130.\n\n\n7\n The Court of Appeals noted: '(A)t least the jury knows that the prosecutor is an advocate and it may be expected, to some degree, to discount such remarks as seller's talk.' 473 F.2d, at 1238.\n\n\n8\n App. 129.\n\n\n9\n No instruction was sought at the time although the court apparently was willing to '(H)ad there been a motion made by you at that time to have me instruct the jury along the lines of eliminating that from their minds, or something of that nature, I certainly would have complied, because I did consider at the time the argument was beyond the grounds of complete propriety, but certainly far from being grounds for a mistrial.' Id., at 133.\n\n\n10\n Id., at 143\u2014144.\n\n\n11\n 360 Mass., at 538, 277 N.E.2d, at 105.\n\n\n12\n 473 F.2d, at 1240.\n\n\n13\n Id., at 1238.\n\n\n14\n 414 U.S., at 146, 94 S.Ct., at 400.\n\n\n15\n Respondent does suggest that the prosecutor's statements may have deprived him of the right to confrontation. See Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965). But this argument is without merit, for the prosecutor here simply stated his own opinions and introduced no statements made by persons unavailable for questioning at trial.\n\n\n16\n 473 F.2d, at 1239.\n\n\n17\n Id., at 1241 (Campbell, J., dissenting).\n\n\n18\n App. 157.\n\n\n19\n Id., at 119.\n\n\n20\n See n. 10, supra.\n\n\n21\n 414 U.S., at 146\u2014147, 94 S.Ct., at 400.\n\n\n22\n See, e.g., Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103, 55 S.Ct. 340, 79 L.Ed. 791 (1935); Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959).\n\n\n23\n We do not, by this decision, in any way condone prosecutorial misconduct, and we believe that trial courts, by admonition and instruction, and appellate courts, by proper exercise of their supervisory power, will continue to discourage it. We only say that, in the circumstances of the case, no prejudice amounting to a denial of constitutional due process was shown.\n\n\n*\n Chief Justice Tauro said in dissent:\n'The prosecutor's argument in the instant case permitted or perhaps even suggested an inference that the defendant had conceded his guilt and was merely hoping for something a little less than a verdict of murder in the first degree. This diminished his change for a fair trial to a far greater degree than would have the publication in a newspaper of his criminal background. Unlike a newspaper, the prosecutor ostensibly speaks with the authority of his office. The prosecutor's 'personal status and his role as a spokesman for the government tend(ed) to give to what he . . . (said) the ring of authenticity . . . tend(ing) to impart an implicit stamp of believability.' Hall v. United States, 419 F.2d 582, 583\u2014584 (5th Cir.). The prosecutor's remarks probably called for a mistrial. In any event the judge's failure to instruct the jury adequately and with sufficient force to eliminate the serious prejudice to the defendant constitutes fatal error. Moreover, the judge's routine final instructions to the jury were far from sufficient to correct the error. By then the defendant's position had so deteriorated that his chances for a fair deliberation of his fate by the jury were virtually eliminated.' 360 Mass., at 549 550, 277 N.E.2d, at 112.\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"348 U.S. 528\n75 S.Ct. 513\n99 L.Ed. 615\nUNITED STATES of America, Petitioner,v.Richard Isaac MENASCHE.\nNo. 104.\nArgued March 1, 1955.\nDecided April 4, 1955.\n\nMr.\nGray Thoron, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nMr. Peyton Ford, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nMr. Justice CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis case and Shomberg v. United States, 348 U.S. 540, 75 S.Ct. 509, present questions concerning the proper interpretation of the general savings clause of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 280, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 note, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 note. This clause, \u00a7 405 of the Act, provides as follows:\n\n\n2\n'(a) Nothing contained in this Act, unless otherwise      specifically provided therein, shall be construed to affect      the validity of any declaration of intention, petition for      naturalization, certificate of naturalization, certificate of      citizenship, warrant of arrest, order or warrant of      deportation, order of exclusion, or other document or      proceeding which shall be valid at the time this Act shall      take effect; or to affect any prosecution, suit, action, or      proceedings, civil or criminal, brought, or any status,      condition, right in process of acquisition, act, thing,      liability, obligation, or matter, civil or criminal, done or      existing, at the time this Act shall take effect; but as to      all such prosecutions, suits, actions, proceedings, statutes      (sic), conditions, rights, acts, things, liabilities,      obligations, or matters the statutes or parts of statutes      repealed by this Act are, unless otherwise specifically      provided therein, hereby continued in force and effect. * *\n\n\n3\n'(b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in title III,      any petition for naturalization heretofore filed which may be      pending at the time this Act shall take effect shall be heard      and determined in accordance with the requirements of law in      effect when such petition was filed.'\n\n\n4\nThe issue here presented is whether an alien, who filed his declaration of intention to become an American citizen before the effective date of the 1952 Act, and who otherwise complied with the naturalization laws then in effect, has a 'status,' 'condition,' or 'right in process of acquisition' preserved by \u00a7 405(a), supra, despite the fact that his petition for naturalization was filed after the effective date of the new Act. The Government contends that petitions for naturalization are to be governed exclusively by \u00a7 405(b), and that since respondent does not come within the terms of that subsection\u2014his petition not having been filed before the effective date of the new Act\u2014the savings clause is inapplicable and the substantive provisions of the 1952 Act apply.\n\n\n5\nThe facts are not in dispute. Respondent was admitted for permanent residence in the United States on March 7, 1948, and the following month he filed his declaration of intention to become a citizen. During the next five years, respondent was absent from the United States on business for several periods of less than a year each. Although the aggregate of these absences was some forty-four months, it is conceded that respondent had not at any time abandoned his American residence. Accordingly, all other prerequisites to citizenship having been satisfied, respondent was entitled to be naturalized under the Nationality Act of 1940 upon completing five years of residence. 54 Stat. 1142, 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) \u00a7 707. But before this period had run, the Immigration and Nationality Act became effective on December 24, 1952. Section 316(a) of this Act, 66 Stat. 242, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1427(a), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1427(a), imposed a new requirement of physical presence: to be eligible for citizenship, an alien must be physically present in the United States for at least one-half the period constituting his five-year residence. When, on April 24, 1953, Menasche filed his petition for naturalization, he lacked 14 months of fulfilling this new requirement. Thus, if the 1952 Act applies to respondent's case, it is clear he may not be naturalized, while under the 1940 Act he is admittedly eligible for citizenship.\n\n\n6\nThe district judge admitted Menasche to citizenship, holding that the 1940 Act governs because respondent enjoyed a status, condition, and right in process of acquisition preserved by \u00a7 405(a) of the new Act. 115 F.Supp. 434. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 210 F.2d 809. We granted certiorari because of the importance of the questions presented in this and the companion case of Shomberg v. United States, 348 U.S. 540, 75 S.Ct. 509, in the administration of our nationality laws. 348 U.S. 811, 75 S.Ct. 33.\n\n\n7\nIn interpreting \u00a7 405 of the Immigration and Nationality Act in relation to the facts of this case, we must consider the historical background of the savings clause and of the procedure for filing declarations of intention. The declaration of intention was introduced into our law by the second Act of Congress on the subject of naturalization, 1 Stat. 414 (1795), and remained an integral part of our naturalization procedure until the Act of 1952 dispensed with it as a prerequisite to citizenship. 66 Stat. 254, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445(f), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1445(f). For the more than 150 years between these enactments, Congress considered it appropriate to require aliens to declare their intention to become United States citizens several years before they petitioned for naturalization. Exceptions were made from time to time to avoid hardship or to expedite the naturalization of a favored group, but until the 1952 enactment the declaration constituted the 'first papers' toward American citizenship in the usual naturalization procedure. See Joint Hearings before the Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., on S. 716, H.R. 2379, and H.R. 2816, pp. 79\u201480, 723\u2014725; S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d, Sess., pp. 732\u2014734.\n\n\n8\nSavings clauses of the type here involved\u2014broad, inclusive provisions\u2014date back to the general statutes on immigration and naturalization enacted in the early part of this century. The Naturalization Act of 1906, 34 Stat. 596, the first real codification of our nationality laws, did not contain a general savings clause, but sought to protect certain prior rights by means of specific provisions. 34 Stat. 597, 599, 603. Nor was there an over-all savings provision in the first of the general immigration laws following the turn of the century. 32 Stat. 1213 (1903). The germ was there, however, in a clause stating that 'nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to affect any prosecution or other proceeding, criminal or civil,' begun under a prior Act. 32 Stat. 1220. In subsequent immigration laws, the predecessors of the instant provision could be more clearly discerned. The Immigration Act of 1907 provided that nothing in the Act 'shall be construed to affect any prosecution, suit, action, or proceedings brought, or any act, thing, or matter, civil or criminal, done or existing at the time of the taking effect of this Act.' 34 Stat. 907. To the same effect is the savings clause of the Immigration Act of 1917. 39 Stat. 897. In the years that followed, amendments to the immigration and naturalization laws were enacted with more limited savings clauses, tailored to the special changes made by the new legislation. 40 Stat. 545, 547, 548; 40 Stat. 559, amended, 55 Stat. 252; 42 Stat. 1022; 43 Stat. 169; 46 Stat. 854.1 These provisions, though differing in their terms, manifested an intention on the part of Congress to save rights which had accrued under prior laws.\n\n\n9\nThe direct antecedent of the savings clause here involved appeared as \u00a7 347 of the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1168, 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) \u00a7 747, the last legislation prior to 1952 to deal with our general system of naturalization. Like the present \u00a7 405, the provision in the 1940 Act was divided into two subsections. The first of these, subsection (a), expanded upon the multiplicity of legal subjects preserved by the 1907 and 1917 immigration laws.2 Subsection (b), on the other hand, introduced an entirely new wrinkle by providing that pending naturalization petitions 'shall be heard and determined within two years thereafter in accordance with the requirements of law in effect when such petition was filed.'3 the litigation under this section, involving, first, the scope of subsection (a) and, secondly, the relation between the two subsections, throws considerable light on the parallel problems under \u00a7 405 presented in the instant case.\n\n\n10\nThe 1952 Act made the enumeration of matters preserved by subsection (a) more complete and all-inclusive by adding: 'status,' 'condition,' 'right in process of acquisition,' 'liability,' and 'obligation.' The change was undoubtedly prompted by several sets of inconsistent decisions dealing with the vague terminology in \u00a7 347(a) of the 1940 Act preserving 'any act, thing, or matter, civil or criminal.' The first of these concerned the question whether the withdrawal of a declaration of intention to avoid service in the armed forces constituted an 'act' existing under the prior law which continued to debar the alien from citizenship. Compare Petition of Otness, D.C., 49 F.Supp. 220, with In re Urmeneta, D.C., 42 F.Supp. 138, and In re Samowich, D.C., 70 F.Supp. 273. A second and more significant conflict concerned inchoate rights to derivative citizenship, which, when proper conditions were met, required only the passage of time to ripen into full citizenship. When the 1940 Act changed certain of the conditions in this process, the question arose whether those whose time had begun to run before the 1940 Act took effect were to be governed by the old law or the new. The Second Circuit held that the new law applied, because \u00a7 347(a) of the 1940 Act did not extend to 'a mere condition, unattended by any affirmative action.' United States ex rel. Aberasturi v. Cain, 147 F.2d 449, 452. The Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia disagreed, construing the broad language of \u00a7 347(a) as covering 'rights partly accrued' and 'rights in process of acquisition.' Bertoldi v. McGrath, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 2, 3, 178 F.2d 977, 978, 979. This latter conflict must have been paramount in the minds of Congress when the first subsection of the savings clause was broadened. See Analysis of S. 3455, 81st Cong. 2d Sess., pp. 361\u20141 and 361\u20142 (prepared by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for the committees of Congress considering this legislation). We conclude that Congress intended to adopt the principle of the Bertoldi case that 'the new act should take effect prospectively.' 86 U.S.App.D.C. 2, 178 F.2d at page 978. This is, after all, no more than a reaffirmation of the principle underlying the less sweeping 1940 provision. In a report to the congressional committees considering this earlier section, it was said that the provision 'contains the customary clauses by which the status quo is maintained in relation to naturalization proceedings and other related matters.' Report of the Joint Departmental Committee, reproduced in Hearings before House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., on H.R. 6127, superseded by H.R. 9980, 411, 484.\n\n\n11\nThe Government would have us limit the 1952 extension of subsection (a) to situations concerning derivative citizenship, arguing that this problem was entirely responsible for the new language on status, condition, and right in process of acquisition. With this we cannot agree. The change in the section was designed to extend a savings clause already broadly drawn, and embodies, we believe, congressional acceptance of the principle that the statutory status quo was to continue even as to rights not fully matured. It should be noted, further, that the conflict between Aberasturi and Bertoldi involved a situation where the alien had failed to take any affirmative action to assert his claim to citizenship. Even the more restrictive Aberasturi opinion recognized that affirmative action by the alien might alter the result there reached. 147 F.2d at page 452. If Congress was willing to preserve a 'mere condition, unattended by any affirmative action,' we think its savings clause also reaches instances, such as this, where affirmative action is present. The whole development of this general savings clause, its predecessors accompanying each of the recent codifications in the field of immigration and naturalization, manifests a well-established congressional policy not to strip aliens of advantages gained under prior laws. The consistent broadening of the savings provision, particularly in its general terminology, indicates that this policy of preservation was intended to apply to matters both within and without the specific contemplation of Congress.\n\n\n12\nThe Government argues against hinging statutes, conditions and rights in process of acquisition on the filing of a declaration of intention because, it contends, the 1952 Act has rendered such declarations totally meaningless as far as naturalization proceedings are concerned. They are no longer a prerequisite to naturalization and they confer no special advantage on the alien-declarant.4 But all this is immaterial. First, the congressional resolution of the Bertoldi-Aberasturi conflict indicates a willingness, at least in some situations, to preserve rights in process of acquisition without requiring affirmative action on the part of the alien. It could be argued in the present case that it was Menasche's residence, rather than his filing of the declaration, which gave rise to his rights under \u00a7 405(a). And this approach would have the virtue of eliminating the inequitable treatment envisaged by the Government as regards those special groups of aliens who did not have to file declarations as a prerequisite to citizenship. But while our decision could be rested on this ground, it is sufficient here merely to refer to the provision in \u00a7 405(a), derived verbatim from \u00a7 347(a) of the 1940 Act, preserving the 'validity' of declarations of intention 'valid at the time the Act shall take effect.'\n\n\n13\nThe Government contends, however, that even if \u00a7 405(a), considered alone, covers this case, \u00a7 405(b) deals specifically with naturalization petitions and by necessary implication excludes their coverage in \u00a7 405(a). As we read the statute, subsection (b) merely implements and emphasizes the operation of its forerunner. It is clear, first, that subsection (b) is not a specific exception to \u00a7 405(a), since both subsections state that prior law should apply in certain circumstances. The slight negative implication derived from the fact that \u00a7 405(b) applies to pending petitions for naturalization, and not to those filed after the effective date of the new Act, is overcome by the broad sweep of \u00a7 405(a) and its direction that prior law applies unless the Act 'otherwise specifically provide(s).'5 (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n14\nThis view is strengthened by the relation between the predecessors of \u00a7 405(a) and (b). The Report of the Joint Departmental Committee, supra, at 484, stated that under \u00a7 347(b) of the 1940 Act 'a period of 2 years would be granted during which any petition for naturalization filed prior to the enactment of the new measure might be heard under the law in effect when the proceeding was begun.' The approach of the courts, in dealing with pending naturalization petitions alleged to be governed by the 1940 savings clause, was generally to see whether petitioner's rights were saved by \u00a7 347(a), and then, if applicable, apply the two-year limitation of \u00a7 347(b). See In re Shaver, 7 Cir., 140 F.2d 180; Petition of La Bella, D.C., 52 F.Supp. 980; Petition of Hirsch, D.C., 50 F.Supp. 638; In re McInnis, D.C., 50 F.Supp. 303. But cf. Petition of Ferrara, Sup., 43 N.Y.S.2d 244. Thus \u00a7 347(a) was considered the source of rights under the savings clause, and \u00a7 347(b) merely a special limitation on these rights. Indeed, there were two cases in which petitions for naturalization filed after the effective date of the 1940 Act were considered solely in relation to \u00a7 347(a). In re Samowich, D.C., 70 F.Supp. 273; Petition of Rothschild, D.C., 57 F.Supp. 814. These decisions ignored the supposedly obvious negative implications of \u00a7 347(b), and cast considerable doubt on the Government's present view that \u00a7 347(b) automatically removed from the coverage of prior law petitions filed after the effective date of the 1940 Act. Thus the construction advanced by the Government concerning the relation between \u00a7 405(a) and \u00a7 405(b) would not continue the relation between the predecessor provisions, but would actually be a marked departure. The only significant change made in subsection (b) by the 1952 Act was the deletion of the two-year time limit, and there is nothing to indicate that Congress, in making this change, intended to alter the entire structure of the savings clause by making \u00a7 405(b) the exclusive provision for naturalization petitions. See Analysis of S. 3455, supra. The few decisions considering this problem under the 1952 Act accord with the decisions of the District Court and Court of Appeals in the instant case, holding that \u00a7 405(a) preserves rights accruing in the pre-petition stages of the naturalization process. United States v. Pringle, 4 Cir., 212 F.2d 878, affirming Petition of Pringle, D.C., 122 F.Supp. 90; In re Jocson, D.C., 117 F.Supp. 528. We believe that Congress so intended.\n\n\n15\nThe Government's contention that \u00a7 405(a) does not apply to any phase in the processing of naturalization petitions would defeat and destroy the plain meaning of that section. 'The cardinal principle of statutory construction is to save and not to destroy.' National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 30, 57 S.Ct. 615, 621, 81 L.Ed. 893. It is our duty 'to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute,' Inhabitants of Montclair Tp. v. Ramsdell, 107 U.S. 147, 152, 2 S.Ct. 391, 395, 27 L.Ed. 431, rather than to enasculate an entire section, as the Government's interpretation requires. Accordingly, we hold that respondent's inchoate right to citizenship is protected by \u00a7 405(a) and is not defeated by any implication stemming from \u00a7 405(b). All that remains, therefore, is to look to \u00a7 316(a), which imposes the new requirement of physical presence, to determine whether it 'otherwise specifically provide(s)' that the new Act is to apply to respondent's situation. It is clear that it does not. Section 316(a) merely says that, 'except as otherwise provided', the stated degree of physical presence shall be required, and this may be viewed as a reference, inter alia, to \u00a7 405(a), strengthening our conclusion that prior law applies. The District Court and the Court of Appeals were correct in concluding that \u00a7 405(a) preserved respondent's inchoate rights under the prior law, and their decisions are accordingly affirmed.\n\n\n16\nAffirmed.\n\n\n17\nMr. Justice HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n\n1\n See also 54 Stat. 1150, 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) \u00a7 726; 64 Stat. 1015, 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed., Supp. V) \u00a7 725(b) (now 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1442(a\u2014c, e), 1441(a)(1)).\n\n\n2\n 'Sec. 347. (a) Nothing contained in either chapter III or in chapter V of this Act, unless otherwise provided therein, shall be construed to affect the validity of any declaration of intention, petition for naturalization, certificate of naturalization or of citizenship, or other docuent or proceeding which shall be valid at the time this Act shall take effect; or to affect any prosecution, suit, action, or proceedings, civil or criminal, brought, or any act, thing, or matter, civil or criminal, done or existing, at the time this Act shall take effect; but as to all such prosecutions, suits, actions, proceedings, acts, things, or matters, the statutes or parts of statutes repealed by this Act, are hereby continued in force and effect.'\n\n\n3\n '(b) Any petition for naturalization heretofore filed which may be pending at the time this Act shall take effect shall be heard and determined within two years thereafter in accordance with the requirements of law in effect when such petition was filed.'\n\n\n4\n The alien may, if he wishes, file a declaration of intention with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 66 Stat. 254, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445(f), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1445(f). The apparent object of this optional provision is to preserve the rights of aliens under state laws, where, for example, there may be a requirement that a legally resident alien shall have filed his declaration of intention before he can obtain work. See Joint Hearings on S. 716, H.R. 2379 and H.R. 2816, supra, p. 80; S.Rep. No. 1515, supra, p. 738.\n\n\n5\n It is possible, although we do not pass on the point in this opinion, that \u00a7 405(b) serves a function which carries with it a negative implication different from that advanced by the Government. Section 405(b) provides that pending petitions for naturalization shall be governed by the 'law in effect when such petition was filed.' (Emphasis supplied.) Section 405(a), on the other hand, provides that nothing in the new Act shall 'affect' any of the enumerated subjects, preserving the law as it existed immediately prior to the effective date of the Act. Thus \u00a7 405(b) may 'otherwise specifically provid(e)' for a law applicable to pending petitions different from the law preserved by \u00a7 405(a) for other protected interests. We have not fully considered, in passing on the question before us, the consonance of such an interpretation with the over-all statutory scheme, but advance it merely as another illustration of the meaning which can be given \u00a7 405(b) to avoid both the result pressed by the Government in this case and the objection that \u00a7 405(b) is rendered redundant by holding that petitioner has rights protected by \u00a7 405(a).\n\n\n","label":1}

Davis, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nMr. Edward H. S. Martin, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\nMr. Chief Justice VINSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nWe are called upon in this case to determine whether Regulation 3450 of the Veterans' Administration1 is in accord with a proper construction of \u00a7 602(h)(2) of the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940.2\n\n\n2\nRespondent, Tillie Zazove, was designated beneficiary in a $5,000 contract of National Service Life Insurance. The insured died in 1943, and the named beneficiary filed her claim for the insurance in the Veterans' Administration. Upon denial of the claim, suit was instituted in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.3 The District Court ruled, on its view of the facts, that Mrs. Zazove did not stand in loco parentis to the soldier and hence was not one of the persons who could be made a beneficiary as provided by the statute.4 On appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled to the contrary and remanded for further proceedings. 156 F.2d 24.\n\n\n3\nThe issue remaining for determination by the District Court upon remand was the validity of Regulation 3450. It sustained the regulation as properly issued pursuant to the National Service Life Insurance Act. On a second appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, reversed. 162 F.2d 443. We granted certiorari to review the important question of statutory construction involved.\n\n\n4\nThe basic statutory provision involved is \u00a7 602(h) of the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940, which provides that insurance issued under the Act 'shall be payable in the following manner:\n\n\n5\n'(1) if the beneficiary to whom payment is first made is under thirty years of age at the time of maturity, in two hundred and forty equal monthly installments: * * *\n\n\n6\n'(2) If the beneficiary to whom payment is first made is thirty or more years of age at the time of maturity, in equal monthly installments for one hundred and twenty months certain, with such payments continuing during the remaining lifetime of such beneficiary.'\n\n\n7\nThe Administrator, acting under the general rule-making power given him by the Act,5 promulgated Regulation 3450 (set forth in the margin)6 shortly after the enactment of the statute, to put \u00a7 602(h) into operation. The regulation provides, for beneficiaries covered by clause (1), that 'payment shall be made in 240 equal monthly installments at the rate of $5.51 for each $1,000 of such insurance.' The amount of the monthly installment is so calculated that the sum of the 240 installments equals the face value of the insurance plus 3% intr est per annum.\n\n\n8\nIt is the provision made by the regulation for first beneficiaries covered by clause (2) that is in issue, since the first beneficiary in this case, Mrs. Zazove, was more than thirty years old when the policy matured. For such beneficiaries, who are to receive payments for life with 120 payments certain, the regulation provides that the 'amount of the monthly installment for each $1,000 of insurance shall be determined by the age of the beneficiary as of last birthday at the time of the death of the insured, in accordance with a schedule based upon the American Experience Table of Mortality and interest at the rate of 3 percentum per annum. * * *' Accordingly, the size of the monthly installment varies not merely with the face value of the insurance policy but also with the age of the first beneficiary, the latter factor being used as the basis of an actuarial computation whereby the face value of the policy plus interest is equalized over the life expectancy of the beneficiary. Under this interpretation of \u00a7 602(h)(2), the respondent, who was 54 years of age at the death of the insured, is entitled to monthly installments of $29.50, at the rate of $5.90 for each $1,000 of insurance in which she had a beneficial interest. These installments are to be paid for 120 months certain,7 and to continue during her remaining lifetime if she lives beyond that 10-year period.\n\n\n9\nIn reversing the District Court, the Circuit Court of Appeals held this method of calculation e t forth by Regulation 3450 to be inconsistent with the provisions of \u00a7 602(h)(2). It construed the latter provisions, in accord with the respondent's contention, as plainly requiring that the total of the equal monthly installments payable over a period of 120 months certain should equal the face value of the insurance, plus interest. Under this construction, Mrs. Zazove is entitled to receive $48.08, instead of $29.50, as her monthly installment, so that the total of the 120 payments certain will amount to $5,000 (plus interest), instead of $3,450 (plus interest) as determined by the Veterans' Administration, with the monthly installments due her if she survives the period of guaranteed payments continuing at the same rate. Taking into account Mrs. Zazove's life expectancy as estimated by the American Experience Table of Mortality, the actual cash value of this $5,000 insurance policy at the time of the insured's death would amount of $8,145 under respondent's construction, instead of $5,000 as determined by the regulation.8\n\n\n10\nIn arriving at its decision, the majority of the Circuit Court of Appeals reasoned that the terms of \u00a7 602(h)(2) are clear and unambiguous; that nothing is said in the statute about equalizing the sum over the life expectancy of the beneficiary; and that Congress unmistakably prescribed payment of the face value plus interest in equal monthly installments over a period of 120 months certain. The major difficulty with this reasoning lies in the inadequate consideration that it gives to the full extent of the payment provided by \u00a7 602(h)(2). In effect, the Circuit Court of Appeals majority stopped short, in its reading of the terms for payment of the insurance in that subsection, at the end of the phrase 'in equal monthly installments for one hundred and twenty months certain.' By stopping short at that phrase, the court failed to consider the alternative possibility that Congress intended the immediately following phrase, 'with such payments continuing during the remaining lifetime of such beneficiary,' to provide an additional and equally essential component of the statutory equivalent for the face value of the insurance. Assuming that this alternative construction of the section is in fact what Congress intended, the only proper interpretative regulation would be one that computed the value of the monthly installments payable to any given first beneficiary in such a manner that the value of the payments to be made, giving due weight to the beneficiary's life expectancy at the death of the insured, would be equivalent to the face value of the policy, plus 3% interest. Regulation 3450 is based on that assumption. It was only because the Circuit Court of Appeals failed to regard the continuing payability of monthly installments, after the payment of the 120 installments certain, as possibly constituting a significant component of the insurance for which the serviceman had contracted, rather than a sheer gratuity conferred by Congress, that the court could view the subsection as plainly and without ambiguity requiring the face value of the insurance to be paid by the end of the 120 months certain.\n\n\n11\nMoreover, the very presence of the term 'certain' in the phrase 'equal monthly installments for one hundred and twenty months certain' suggests a view contrary to that reached by the court below. It will be noted that when Congress had in mind, as it clearly did in the case of \u00a7 602(h)(1), that a fixed number of installments provided for should equal the face value of the insurance, there was no occasion for the use of 'certain' in describing the installments to be made and, indeed, the term is not found in \u00a7 602(h)(1). While the inclusion of the term in describing the fixed number of installments to be paid under \u00a7 602(h)(2) might conceivably be a mere superfluity, its presence at least suggests the far greater probability that it was used in the specialized, technical sense in which it is generally employed in the insurance field\u2014namely, to indicate a guaranty that a designated number of monthly payments shall be forthcoming, where a policy provides an option for equal monthly installments continuing throughout the lifetime of a payee, with the individual installment varying in amount depending on the age of the beneficiary when the policy matures.9\n\n\n12\nHence, in our view, a reading of \u00a7 602(h)(2) in its entirety suffices to demonstrate that the language there used by Congress is far from being so clear and so free from ambiguity as to preclude the construction adopted by the Veterans' Administration in Regulation 3450. To this extent, we believe the reasoning of the Circuit Court of Appeals was in error. But that alone would not necessarily invalidate its holding since, as the Government appears to concede, the terms of \u00a7 602(h)(2) are not unambiguously in accord with the regulation. Indeed, if the ambiguity inherent in \u00a7 602(h)(2) were found in the terms of an ordinary commercial insurance policy, there might well be substantial ground for construing it in favor of the insured.10\n\n\n13\nThere is, of course, a marked distinction between the criteria for judicial construction of an ordinary commercial insurance contract, and construction of the provisions of an act of Congress setting up a system of national life insurance for servicemen to be administered by a governmental agency. The statutory provisions, where ambiguous, are to be construed liberally to effectuate the beneficial purposes that Congress had in mind. In this respect, judicial construction of the statute may appear similar to construction of a commercial policy, where ambiguous provisions are generally construed in favor of the insured. In the latter case, construction favorable to the insured rests on the theory that 'The phraseology of contracts of insurance is that chosen by the insurer and the contract in fixed form is tendered to the prospective policy holder who is often without technical training, and who rarely accepts it with a lawyer at his elbow. So if its language is reasonably open to two constructions, that more favorable to the insured will be adopted * * * and unless it is obvious that the words are intended to be used in their technical connotation they will be given the meaning that common speech imports. * * *'11 But the statute is an expression of legislative intent rather than the embodiment of an agreement between Congress and the insured person. Only the intent of Congress, which in this case is the insurer, need be ascertained to fix the meaning of the statutory terms; the layman understanding of the policy holder does not have the relevance here that it has in the construction of a commercial contract.12\n\n\n14\nOn the other hand, we think it clear that an administrative regulation purporting to construe an ambiguous subsection of the National Life Insurance Act of 1940 is not automatically to be deemed valid merely because not plainly interdicted by the terms of the particular provision construed. The Administrator's general rule-making power, which was exercised in issuing Regulation 3450, is limited by the statute to 'such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, as are necessary or ap ropriate to carry out its purposes * * *.'13 Moreover, a 1946 amendment to \u00a7 608, designed to eliminate the finality of the decisions of the Administrator on insurance matters,14 amended the last sentence of \u00a7 608 to add the words set out in italics:\n\n\n15\n'Except in the event of suit as provided in section 617 hereof, or other appropriate court proceedings, all decisions rendered by the Administrator under the provisions of this Act, or regulations properly issued pursuant thereto, shall be final and conclusive on all questions of law or fact, and no other official of the United States, except a judge or judges of United States courts, shall have jurisdiction to review any such decisions.'\n\n\n16\nThe extension of procedures available to secure judicial review, the interpolation of the word 'properly,' and the addition, presumably out of an abundance of caution, of the tautological phrase 'except a judge or judges of United States courts' are indicative of congressional concern that the regulations of the Veterans' Administration be subject to more than casual judicial scrutiny when they are based upon a controverted construction of the statute.\n\n\n17\nAccordingly, \u00a7 602(h)(2) must be read in the full context of related sections of the statute and other indicia of legislative intent before we can adequately determine whether the regulation is 'not inconsistent' with the provisions of the Act and whether it is 'necessary or appropriate to carry out its purposes.' We turn therefore from narrow, semantic considerations to a broader context in which the intent of Congress can be more readily comprehended.\n\n\n18\nThe proper meaning of \u00a7 602(h)(2) becomes apparent when the respective assumptions and consequences of each of the two alternative interpretations before us are tested against the legislative history and the statute viewed in its entirety. The construction adopted by the Circuit Court of Appeals would result in conferring a far greater return to beneficiaries in the group covered by \u00a7 602(h)(2), i.e., over thirty at the time of the insured's death, than the return to which first beneficiaries covered by \u00a7 602(h)(1), i.e., under thirty at the insured's death, are entitled. It is unquestioned that the latter group, under the original statutory provisions,15 were entitled only to 240 monthly installments (i.e., over a 20-year period) which in the aggregate equal the face value plus interest, with no further installments payable thereafter, whether or not the payee survived that limited period. But, under the ruling of the Circuit Court of Appeals, payments in many if not most of the cases involving the former group of beneficiaries would exceed the face value of the policy since any first beneficiary who survived the 10-year period of \u00a7 602(h) (2) would automatically secure more than that amount. In fact, the actual value of a policy, at maturity, to a 30-year old beneficiary, under this ruling, would be almost two and a half times its face amount,16 whereas the 29-year old beneficiary, paid in accordance with \u00a7 602(h)(1) (whose interpretation is not open to question), could never receive more than the face amount, plus interest. And the aggregate of guaranteed and continuing payments made at so high a rate under \u00a7 602(h)(2) would necessarily greatly exceed the total face value of the policies issued under the statute.17\n\n\n19\nThis sharp disparity between the two different groups of beneficiaries does not result under the regulation, since the age of the first beneficiary is used by the regulation as the basis of an actuarial calculation pursuant to a formula whereby total payments under \u00a7 602(h)(2) approximate the face value of the policies, plus interest. The extent of the difference in result is indicated by the table, set forth in the margin,18 of comparative present values of the monthly installments under the regulation and under the view of the Circuit Court of Appeals, taking into account the beneficiary's life expectancy as shown by the American Experience Table of Mortality.\n\n\n20\nThe Circuit Court thought it probable that Congress originally intended the higher rate of benefit payments to be restricted to the beneficiaries covered by \u00a7 602(h)(2) because that group of persons over 30 at the time of the serviceman's death would include parents, who would be at least middleaged, and 'young widows with small children whose ten years of monthly payments would end at the most needed time.'19 This would hardly serve to explain, however, why Congress would intentionally discriminate in so substantial a manner against a similarly deserving but slightly younger widow in the under-thirty category by failing to extend comparable benefits to the latter group.\n\n\n21\nThe disparity in benefits available under the respondent's view, as contrasted with those available under the regulation, is reflected in a correspondingly large increase, under the former view, in the total liability for beneficial payments.20 This greatly enhanced liability could be met, theoretically, in either of two ways: by special congressional appropriations, or by greatly increased premium rates substantially above those which are now set by the Veterans' Administration on the assumption that the regulation is proper.\n\n\n22\nThe Circuit Court of Appeals was of the opinion that Congress intended the Government to bear the burden of this extraordinary liability. By express provisions in the 1940 Act, Congress specified that the United States would bear the administrative costs of the insurance system,21 excess mortality and disability cost resulting from the extra hazards of war,22 and the cost of reimbursing the reserve fund for waiving recovery of benefit payments erroneously made where it would be inequitable to require repayment.23 Congress obviously contemplated that the reserve fund to meet the liabilities of National Service Life Insurance policies was to be self-supporting, sustained by the premiums paid and by the yield of premiums invested, in all respects aside from those exceptional situations where the statute specifically designated that the Government would bear the financial burden. Yet Congress nowhere specified that the United States would bear the huge cost of the enhanced liability that it would necessarily have anticipated had it impressed upon \u00a7 602(h)(2) the meaning that respondent finds there; and that striking omission is persuasive, in the absence of cogent considerations to the contrary, that no generosity of this magnitude was contemplated.24\n\n\n23\nNor can it be assumed that Congress envisaged the setting of premium rates high enough to meet an added liability of such proportions. Senator Harrison, who was in charge of the original bill, informed the Senate that 'Premium rates based on the average age\u201425 years\u2014will be 67 cents per thousand per month.'25 Such a rate, though adequate to cover payments under Regulation 3450, would be completely inadequate under the respondent's construction.\n\n\n24\nMoreover, whatever ambiguity exists in the language of \u00a7 602(h)(2) is dispelled by a consideration of the practice in effect under United States Government Life Insurance, established for World War I veterans, and the long-established prat ice of commercial insurance companies, viewed as part of the background of experience which the draftsmen of \u00a7 602(h)(2) may be assumed to have had in mind.\n\n\n25\nThe World War Veterans Act, 1924,26 provided for payment of insurance benefits in 240 equal monthly installments, but authorized the Veterans' Administration (formerly the Veterans' Bureau) to provide in the contract of insurance 'for optional settlements, to be selected by the insured, whereby such insurance may be made payable either in one sum or in installments for thirty-six months or more. * * *' One of the options set up by Regulation 3068 under this statutory authorization, provided that monthly installments in amounts designated in an appended table\u2014the amounts being graduated, just as in Regulation 3450, with the 'age of beneficiary at time of death of the insured'\u2014'will be payable throughout the lifetime of the designated beneficiary, but if such designated beneficiary dies before 240 such installments have been paid, the remaining unpaid monthly installments will be payable in accordance with the beneficiary provisions of the policy.'27\n\n\n26\nIt seems apparent to us that the congressional draftsmen, in framing \u00a7 602(h) (2), were undoubtedly striving to incorporate into the 1940 Act a provision modeled on the life-annuity-with-240-payments-certain option set up by Regulation 3068 under the World War Veterans Act of 1924, deviating materially only in the number of payments guaranteed. True, \u00a7 602(h)(2) does not itself define expressly the method of computation to be used by the Administrator in determining the size of the monthly installments in any given case. But, taking into account the factors previously set forth and considering them against the background of experience under the 1924 Act, the only reasonable conclusion is that Congress intended the calculation to be an acturial one, based on the age of the beneficiary. To subscribe to the opposite conclusion, we must believe that Congress intended, by its wording of \u00a7 602(h)(2), to bestow upon beneficiaries of World War II servicemen total payments completely disproportionate to those available to beneficiaries of World War I servicemen. To believe that Congress, by the enactment of a somewhat ambiguous provision, intended this disproportionate result along with the other disparities that have been shown to be required by the respondent's view, puts too great a strain upon the imagination.\n\n\n27\nMoreover, the congressional draftsmen of \u00a7 602(h)(2), with the example before them of the 1924 Act and the similar practice of standard commercial insurance companies, undoubtedly considered that even the very wording of that subsection, without more, necessarily implied that the Administrator was to follow the existing practice in calculating the size of the monthly installments. As previously noted, the term 'certain' appearing in the phrase 'equal monthly installments for one hundred and twenty months certain' is a technical word that connotes, because of the context in which it is commonly used in standard commercial policies, an actuarial calculation of the monthly installments payable.\n\n\n28\nFor example, one of the standard life insurance policies used in 1940 provided for a life income option to be 'Made payable in equal annual, semi-annual, quarterly or monthly instalments for ten or twenty years certain, with payments continuing during the remaining lifetime of the person upon whose life the income depends. * * * The first instalment will be due upon the date on which the option becomes operative. The amount of such instalments shall be determined in accordance with the table of instalments on the following page, which instalments include interest at the rate of 3% per annum, and shall be based on the sex and the age at birthday nearest the due date of the first instalment, of the person upon whose life the income deped s. * * *'28 Another example, closer to the concise form of \u00a7 602(h)(2), though using the term 'fixed' rather than 'certain,' is an option which provides for 'the payment of equal monthly instalments in accordance with the table below (a table whose payments are graduated in amount with respect to the 'Age of Payee Nearest Birthday at Date of First Instalment'), to the insured or the beneficiary, as the case may be, for a fixed period of ten years and for so long thereafter as the payee shall survive, the first instalment being payable immediately.'29\n\n\n29\nCongress may also have assumed that its intent was made manifest by the juxtaposition of \u00a7 602(h)(2) with other provisions having similar connotations. Section 605(b), for example, authorizes the Administrator 'to set aside out of (the National Service Life Insurance Fund) such reserve amounts as may be required under accepted actuarial principles, to meet all liabilities under such insurance * * *.' (Italics added.) And \u00a7 602(e) provides that the premium rates, all 'cash, loan, paid up, and extended values, and all other calculations in connection with such insurance, shall be based upon said American Experience Table of Mortality and interest at the rate of 3 per centum per annum. * * *' (Italics added.)\n\n\n30\nIn any event, the subsequent legislative history of the statute clearly indicates congressional approval of the construction put upon \u00a7 602(h)(2) by Regulation 3450. A proposed bill was suggested in a letter written by the Administrator of the Veterans' Administration to Congress in June, 1944, to amend \u00a7\u00a7 602(h)(1) and 602(h)(2) of the 1940 Act by authorizing 'the election of a refund life income in lieu of the mode of payments now provided.'30 In explaining the necessity of the amendment, the Administrator pointed out that if 'a widow having a minor child, who is entitled to payments as provided in section 602(h)(2), dies after having received one or more installments of insurance, payments under the contract will cease after payment of 120 installments has been completed even though the total amount of the installments paid or payable is less than the face value of the policy and even though the child is too young to be capable of self-support at the time payments expire. The proposed amendments will authorize the payment of the full face value of the insurance in every instance and will also insure an income throughout the lifetime of the first beneficiary under the policy.'31\n\n\n31\nIn other words, the amendment was proposed partly to extend a life income option to beneficiaries covered by \u00a7 602(h)(1), who theretofore had been eligible only for the 240-payment plan, and partly to provide a solution for the inequitable situation presented in certain cases covered by the provisions of \u00a7 602(h)(2), when the 120 installments certain amounted to less than the face value of the policy and the first beneficiaryd ied before having received an amount equal to that face value. The inequitable situation thus considered to be present under \u00a7 602(h)(2) and sought to be ameliorated by the proposed amendment could not have existed, of course, if the Circuit Court of Appeals were correct in the construction it has put upon \u00a7 602(h)(2).\n\n\n32\nThe Senate Committee on Finance, in recommending passage of the bill, adopted the Administrator's letter as explanatory of the various provisions of the bill32 and indicated thereby its approval of the interpretation embodied in Regulation 3450, since otherwise a major purpose claimed to be effected by the amendment would have been completely illusory. Moreover, a table included in the Administrator's letter, comparing the amount of each monthly imstallment and the sum of the guaranteed installments under the new refund life income plan and under \u00a7 602(h)(2), clearly apprised Congress of the construction put upon the latter section by the regulation. Hence, in enacting the amendment33 Congress indicated its approval of the interpretation upon which the Regulation is based.34\n\n\n33\nSimilar recognition that in many instances 'the aggregate amount of insurance actually payable' under the original mode of settlement provided by \u00a7 602(h)(2) 'amounted to much less than the face of the policy' was given by the House Committee on World War Veterans' Legislation, in recommending a 1946 amendment to permit policies on which payments had been made prior to the 1944 act to elect the refund life income plan.35 The 1946 bill also included a provision setting up optional modes of settlement for insurance maturing on or after August 1, 1946, and the third option was couched in language identical in every significant respect to that used in the original \u00a7 602(h)(2).36 Accordingly, when Congress enacted the 1946 bill, it in effect incorporated the old provision of \u00a7 602(h)(2), which was the basis for Regulation 3450, and in our view thereby accepted the construction embodied in that regulation, which had been so clearly brought to its attention on this and prior occasions.\n\n\n34\nFurther evidence, were any needed, that Congress accepted as its own this interpretation of the language used in \u00a7 602(h)(2) is supplied by the significant distinction maintained in this reenactment between the mode of payment originally provided by \u00a7 602(h)(2) and the refund life income plan, viewed in the light of the House Committee Report on the bill. It is hardly conceivable and if conceivable, hardly explicable\u2014that Congress meant one thing by the language it used in \u00a7 602(h)(2) when enacting the original measure in 1940, and another, quite different thing, when it reenacted that language in 1946.\n\n\n35\nIn the light of the foregoing considerations the validity of Regulation 3450 is sustained and the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed.\n\n\n36\nReversed.\n\n\n\n1\n 6 Fed.Reg. 1162, 1166, 38 C.F.R. 1941 Supp. \u00a7 10.3450.\n\n\n2\n Part I, Title VI of the Second Revenue Act of 1940, Act of Oct. 8, 1940, c. 757, 54 Stat. 974, 1008, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801, 802(h)(2), 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 801, 802(h)(2).\n\n\n3\n Pursuant to \u00a7 617 of the Act, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 817, 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 817.\n\n\n4\n \u00a7 602(g), 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(g), 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 802(g).\n\n\n5\n Sec. 608, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 808, 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 808: 'The Administrator, subject to the general direction of the President, shall administer, execute, and enforce the provisions of this chapter, shall have power to make such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, as are necessary or appropriate to carry out its purposes, and shall decide all questions arising hereunder. * * *'\n\n\n6\n 'Payment to first beneficiary.\u2014Upon due proof of the death of the insured while a National Service Life Insurance policy is in force, the monthly installments, without interest, which have accrued since the death of the insured (the first installment being due on the date of death of the insured) and the monthly installments which thereafter become payable in accordance with the provisions of the policy, shall be paid to the beneficiary or beneficiaries entitled in the following manner:\n'(a) If the beneficiary to whom payment is first made is under thirty years of age at the time of the death of the insured, payment shall be made in 240 equal monthly installments at the rate of $5.51 for each $1,000 of such insurance.\n'(b) If the beneficiary to whom payment is first made is thirty or more years of age at the time of the death of the insured, payment shall be made in equal monthly installments for 120 months certain, with such payment continuing throughout the remaining life-time of such beneficiary.

Acceptance of respondent's interpretation would require us to view Congress as having offered, in the 1946 amendment, four optional settlements (see note 36 infra), three of which would be limited in value at maturity to the face amount of the insurance, while the fourth option would offer a value far in excess of the face amount and would be available to all beneficiaries without regard to their age at the insured's death.\nBy the calculations of the American Experience Table, a person has to be 68 years old before his life expectancy is less than 10 years. Accordingly, in all cases where the first beneficiary is under 68 years of age at the time the insured dies, the actual value of the policy, thus computed, would exceed its face amount. The Administrator estimates that, on the approximately 2.1 billion dollars of death claims already incurred and now being settled under the provision for life income with installments guaranteed for 120 months, the additional liability that would result if settlement were required to be made pursuant to the Circuit Court's holding would amount to approximately 1.8 billion dollars. Government's brief, p. 67. Potential liability on the billions of dollars of insurance now in force and yet to mature would similarly be vastly increased under this view.\nThe precise size of the latter liability is of course problematical. In a letter to the Solicitor General, dated October 24, 1947, the Veterans' Administration estimated the amount of insurance in force and not yet matured at 35 billion dollars. Assuming that all of that insurance would be held to mature at death and that the typical beneficiary would be a woman aged 30 at the death of her husband, and that all policies would be settled under the life income option with installments guaranteed for 120 months, the Administrator estimated that potential liability under respondent's view of the statute might be about 97 billion dollars, instead of 35 billion dollars (the potential liability under Regulation 3450)\u2014an increased future liability of 62 billion dollars. And if 10% of all lapsed policies were reinstated, the potential additional liability (on the basis of the above assumptions) would be about 19.7 billion dollars.\nWhile these assumptions may be overly favorable to the Government's contentions and may not be fully borne out by the course of future events, it is obvious\u2014even allowing for a wide margin of error\u2014that the added potential liability under the holding of the Circuit Court of Appeals might well amount to billions of dollars.\n\n\n18\nPresent value  Present value\nunder               under\nBeneficiary's        Regulation  C.

The imposition of the death penalty is not Per se cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Gregg, ante, at 168-187, 96 S.Ct., at 168-187. P. 247.\n\n\n2\n2. On its face, the Florida procedures for imposition of the death penalty satisfy the constitutional deficiencies identified in Furman, supra. Florida trial judges are given specific and detailed guidance to assist them in deciding whether to impose a death penalty or imprisonment for life, and their decisions are reviewed to ensure that they comport with other sentences imposed under similar circumstances. Petitioner's contentions that the new Florida procedures remain arbitrary and capricious lack merit. Pp. 251-259.\n\n\n3\n(a) The argument that the Florida system is constitutionally invalid because it allows discretion to be exercised at each stage of the criminal proceeding fundamentally misinterprets Furman. Gregg, ante, at 199, 96 S.Ct., at 2937. P. 254.\n\n\n4\n(b) The aggravating circumstances authorizing the death penalty if the crime is \"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel,\" or if \"(t)he defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons,\" as construed by the Florida Supreme Court, provide adequate guidance to those involved in the sentencing process and as thus construed are not overly broad. Pp. 255-256.\n\n\n5\n(c) Petitioner's argument that the imprecision of the mitigating circumstances makes them incapable of determination by a judge or jury and other contentions in a similar vein raise questions about line-drawing evaluations that do not differ from factors that juries and judges traditionally consider. The Florida statute gives clear and precise directions to judge and jury to enable them to weigh aggravating circumstances against mitigating ones. P. 257-258.\n\n\n6\n(d) Contrary to petitioner's contention, the State Supreme Court's review role is neither ineffective nor arbitrary, as evidenced by the careful procedures it has followed in assessing the imposition of death sentences, over a third of which that court has vacated. Pp. 258-259.\n\n\n7\nMr. Justice WHITE, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST, concluded that under the Florida law the sentencing judge is Required to impose the death penalty on all first-degree murderers as to whom the statutory aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors, and as to those categories the penalty will not be freakishly or rarely, but will be regularly, imposed; and therefore the Florida scheme does not run afoul of the Court's holding in Furman. Petitioner's contentions about prosecutorial discretion and his argument that the death penalty may never be imposed under any circumstances consistent with the Eighth Amendment are without substance. See, Gregg v. Georgia, ante, at 224-225, 96 S.Ct., at 2948-2949 (White, J., concurring in judgment) and Roberts v.

James, Los Angeles, Cal., for State of California, as amicus curiae, and Sol. Gen. Robert H. Bork, Washington, D. C., for the U. S., as amicus curiae.\n\n\n12\nJudgment of the Court, and opinion of Mr. Justice STEWART, Mr. Justice POWELL, and Mr. Justice STEVENS, announced by Mr. Justice POWELL.\n\n\n13\nThe issue presented by this case is whether the imposition of the sentence of death for the crime of murder under the law of Florida violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n\n14\n* The petitioner, Charles William Proffitt, was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death for the first-degree murder of Joel Medgebow. The circumstances surrounding the murder were testified to by the decedent's wife, who was present at the time it was committed. On July 10, 1973, Mrs. Medgebow awakened around 5 a. m. in the bedroom of her apartment to find her husband sitting up in bed, moaning. He was holding what she took to be a ruler.1 Just then a third person jumped up, hit her several times with his fist, knocked her to the floor, and ran out of the house. It soon appeared that Medgebow had been fatally stabbed with a butcher knife. Mrs. Medgebow was not able to identify the attacker, although she was able to give a description of him.2\n\n\n15\nThe petitioner's wife testified that on the night before the murder the petitioner had gone to work dressed in a white shirt and gray pants, and that he had returned at about 5:15 a. m. dressed in the same clothing but without shoes. She said that after a short conversation the petitioner had packed his clothes and departed. A young woman boarder, who overheard parts of the petitioner's conversation with his wife, testified that the petitioner had told his wife that he had stabbed and killed a man with a butcher knife while he was burglarizing a place, and that he had beaten a woman. One of the petitioner's coworkers testified that they had been drinking together until 3:30 or 3:45 on the morning of the murder and that the petitioner had then driven him home. He said that the petitioner at this time was wearing gray pants and a white shirt.\n\n\n16\nThe jury found the defendant guilty as charged. Subsequently, as provided by Florida law, a separate hearing was held to determine whether the petitioner should be sentenced to death or to life imprisonment. Under the state law that decision turned on whether certain statutory aggravating circumstances surrounding the crime outweighed any statutory mitigating circumstances found to exist.3 At that hearing it was shown that the petitioner had one prior conviction, a 1967 charge of breaking and entering. The State also introduced the testimony of the physician (Dr. Crumbley) at the jail where the petitioner had been held pending trial. He testified that the petitioner had come to him as a physician, and told him that he was concerned that he would harm other people in the future, that he had had an uncontrollable desire to kill that had already resulted in his killing one man, that this desire was building up again, and that he wanted psychiatric help so he would not kill again. Dr. Crumbley also testified that, in his opinion, the petitioner was dangerous and would be a danger to his fellow inmates if imprisoned, but that his condition could be treated successfully.\n\n\n17\nThe jury returned an advisory verdict recommending the sentence of death. The trial judge ordered an independent psychiatric evaluation of the petitioner, the results of which indicated that the petitioner was not, then or at the time of the murder, mentally impaired. The judge then sentenced the petitioner to death. In his written findings supporting the sentence, the judge found as aggravating circumstances that (1) the murder was premeditated and occurred in the course of a felony (burglary); (2) the petitioner has the propensity to commit murder; (3) the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel; and (4) the petitioner knowingly, through his intentional act, created a great risk of serious bodily harm and death to many persons. The judge also found specifically that none of the statutory mitigating circumstances existed. The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed. 315 So.2d 461 (1975). We granted certiorari, 423 U.S. 1082, 96 S.Ct. 1090, 47 L.Ed.2d 94 (1976), to consider whether the imposition of the death sentence in this case constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nII\n\n18\nThe petitioner argues that the imposition of the death penalty under any circumstances is cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. We reject this argument for the reasons stated today in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 168-187, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2922-2932, 49 L.Ed.2d 859.\n\nIII\nA.\n\n19\nIn response to Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972), the Florida Legislature adopted new statutes that authorize the imposition of the death penalty on those convicted of first-degree murder. Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 782.04(1)(Supp. 1976-1977).4 At the same time Florida adopted a new capital-sentencing procedure, patterned in large part on the Model Penal Code. See \u00a7 921.141 (Supp.1976-1977).5 Under the new statute, if a defendant is found guilty of a capital offense, a separate evidentiary hearing is held before the trial judge and jury to determine his sentence. Evidence may be presented on any matter the judge deems relevant to sentencing and must include matters relating to certain legislatively specified aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Both the prosecution and the defense may present argument on whether the death penalty shall be imposed.\n\n\n20\nAt the conclusion of the hearing the jury is directed to consider \"(w)hether sufficient mitigating circumstances exist . . . which outweigh the aggravating circumstances found to exist; and . . . (b)ased on these considerations, whether the defendant should be sentenced to life (imprisonment) or death.\" \u00a7\u00a7 921.141(2)(b) and (c)(Supp.1976-1977).6 The jury's verdict is determined by majority vote. It is only advisory; the actual sentence is determined by the trial judge. The Florida Supreme Court has stated, however, that \"(i)n order to sustain a sentence of deatfollowing a jury recommendation of life, the facts suggesting a sentence of death should be so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ.\" Tedder v. State, 322 So.2d 908, 910 (1975). Accord, Thompson v. State, 328 So.2d 1, 5 (1976). Cf. Spinkellink v. State, 313 So.2d 666, 671 (1975).7[n]\n\n\n21\nThe trial judge is also directed to weigh the statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances when he determines the sentence to be imposed on a defendant. The statute requires that if the trial court imposes a sentence of death, \"it shall set forth in writing its findings upon which the sentence of death is based as to the facts: (a) (t)hat sufficient (statutory) aggravating circumstances exist . . . and (b) (t)hat there are insufficient (statutory) mitigating circumstances . . . to outweigh the aggravating circumstances.\" \u00a7 921.141(3) (Supp.1976-1977).8\n\n\n22\nThe statute provides for automatic review by the Supreme Court of Florida of all cases in which a death sentence has been imposed. \u00a7 921.141(4) (Supp.1976-1977). The law differs from that of Georgia in that it does not require the court to conduct any specific form of review. Since, however, the trial judge must justify the imposition of a death sentence with written findings, meaningful appellate review of each such sentence is made possible and the Supreme Court of Florida like its Georgia counterpart considers its function to be to \"(guarantee) that the (aggravating and mitigating) reasons present in one case will reach a similar result to that reached under similar circumstances in another case. . . . If a defendant is sentenced to die, this Court can review that case in light of the other decisions and determine whether or not the punishment is too great.\" State v. Dixon, 283 So.2d 1, 10 (1973).\n\n\n23\nOn their face these procedures, like those used in Georgia, appear to meet the constitutional deficiencies identified in Furman. The sentencing authority in Florida, the trial judge, is directed to weigh eight aggravating factors against seven mitigating factors to determine whether the death penalty shall be imposed. This determination requires the trial judge to focus on the circumstances of the crime and the character of the individual defendant. He must Inter alia, consider whether the defendant has a prior criminal record, whether the defendant acted under duress or under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, whether the defendant's role in the crime was that of a minor accomplice, and whether the defendant's youth argues in favor of a more lenient sentence than might otherwise be imposed. The trial judge must also determine whether the crime was committed in the course of one of several enumerated felonies, whether it was committed for pecuniary gain, whether it was committed to assist in an escape from custody or to prevent a lawful arrest, and whether the crime was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. To answer these questions, which are not unlike those considered by a Georgia sentencing jury, see Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S., at 197, 96 S.Ct., at 2936, the sentencing judge must focus on the individual circumstances of each homicide and each defendant.\n\n\n24\nThe basic difference between the Florida system and the Georgia system is that in Florida the sentence is determined by the trial judge rather than by the jury.9 This Court has pointed out that jury sentencing in a capital case can perform an important societal function, Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 519 n. 15, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 1775, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968), but it has never suggested that jury sentencing is constitutionally required. And it would appear that judicial sentencing should lead, if anything, to even greater consistency in the imposition at the trial court level of capital punishment, since a trial judge is more experienced in sentencing than a jury, and therefore is better able to impose sentences similar to those imposed in analogous cases.10\n\n\n25\nThe Florida capital-sentencing procedures thus seek to assure that the death penalty will not be imposed in an arbrary or capricious manner. Moreover, to the extent that any risk to the contrary exists, it is minimized by Florida's appellate review system, under which the evidence of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances is reviewed and reweighed by the Supreme Court of Florida \"to determine independently whether the imposition of the ultimate penalty is warranted.\" Songer v. State, 322 So.2d 481, 484 (1975). See also Sullivan v. State, 303 So.2d 632, 637 (1974). The Supreme Court of Florida, like that of Georgia, has not hesitated to vacate a death sentence when it has determined that the sentence should not have been imposed. Indeed, it has vacated 8 of the 21 death sentences that it has reviewed to date. See Taylor v. State, 294 So.2d 648 (1974); Lamadline v. State, 303 So.2d 17 (1974); Slater v. State, 316 So.2d 539 (1975); Swan v. State, 322 So.2d 485 (1975); Tedder v. State, 322 So.2d 908 (1975); Halliwell v. State, 323 So.2d 557 (1975); Thompson v. State, 328 So.2d 1 (1976); Messer v. State, 330 So.2d 137 (1976).\n\n\n26\nUnder Florida's capital-sentencing procedures, in sum, trial judges are given specific and detailed guidance to assist them in deciding whether to impose a death penalty or imprisonment for life. Moreover, their decisions are reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with other sentences imposed in similar circumstances. Thus, in Florida, as in Georgia, it is no longer true that there is \" 'no meaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases in which (the death penalty) is imposed from the many cases in which it is not.' \" Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S., at 188, 96 S.Ct., at 2932, quoting Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S., at 313, 92 S.Ct., at 2764 (White, J, concurring). On its face the Florida system thus satisfies the constitutional deficiencies identified in Furman.\n\nB\n\n27\nAs in Gregg, the petitioner contends, however, that, while perhaps facially acceptable, the new sentencing procedures in actual effect are merely cosmetic, and that arbitrariness and caprice still pervade the system under which Florida imposes the death penalty.\n\n\n28\n(1)\n\n\n29\nThe petitioner first argues that arbitrariness is inherent in the Florida criminal justice system because it allows discretion to be exercised at each stage of a criminal proceeding the prosecutor's decision whether to charge a capital offense in the first place, his decision whether to accept a plea to a lesser offense, the jury's consideration of lesser included offenses, and, after conviction and unsuccessful appeal, the Executive's decision whether to commute a death sentence. As we noted in Gregg, this argument is based on a fundamental misinterpretation of Furman, and we reject it for the reasons expressed in Gregg. See 428 U.S., at 199, 96 S.Ct., at 2937.\n\n\n30\n(2)\n\n\n31\nThe petitioner next argues that the new Florida sentencing procedures in reality do not eliminate the arbitrary infliction of death that was condemned in Furman. Basically he contends that the statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances are vague and overbroad,11 and that the statute gives no guidance as to how the mitigating and aggravating circumstances should be weighed in any specific case.\n\n(a)\n\n32\nInitially the petitioner asserts that the enumerated aggravating and mitigating circumstances are so vague and so broad that virtually \"any capital defendant becomes a candidate for the death penalty . . . .\" In particular, the petitioner attacks the eighth and third statutory aggravating circumstances, which authorize the death penalty to be imposed if the crime is \"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel,\" or if \"(t)he defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons.\" \u00a7\u00a7 921.141(5)(h), (c) (Supp.1976-1977). These provisions must be considered as they have been construed by the Supreme Court of Florida.\n\n\n33\nThat court has recognized that while it is arguable \"that all killings are atrocious, . . . (s)till, we believe that the Legislature intended something 'especially' heinous, atrocious or cruel when it authorized the death penalty for first degree murder.\" Tedder v. State, 322 So.2d, at 910. As a consequence, the court has indicated that the eighth statutory provision is directed only at \"the conscienceless or pitiless crime which is unnecessarily torturous to the victim.\" State v. Dixon, 283 So.2d, at 9. See also Alford v. State, 307 So.2d 433, 445 (1975); Halliwell v. State, supra, 323 So.2d, at 561.12 We can say that the provision, as so construed, provides inadequate guidance to those charged with the duty of recommending or imposing sentences in capital cases. See Gregg v. Georgia, ante, 428 U.S., at 200-203, 96 S.Ct., at 2938-2939.\n\n\n34\nIn the only case, except for the instant case, in which the third aggravating factor \"(t)he defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons\" was found, Alvord v. State, 322 So.2d 533 (1975), the State Supreme Court held that the defendant created a great risk of death because he \"obviously murdered two of the victims in order to avoid a surviving witness to the (first) murder.\" Id., at 540.13 As construed by the Supreme Court of Florida these provisions are not impermissibly vague.14\n\n(b)\n\n35\nThe petitioner next attacks the imprecision of the mitigating circumstances. He argues that whether a defendant acted \"under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance,\" whether a defendant's capacity \"to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired,\" or whether a defendant's participation as an accomplice in a capital felony was \"relatively minor,\" are questions beyond the capacity of a jury or judge to determine. See \u00a7\u00a7 921.141(6)(b), (f), (d) (Supp.1976-1977).\n\n\n36\nHe also argues that neither a jury nor a judge is capable of deciding how to weigh a defendant's age or determining whether he had a \"significant history of prior criminal activity.\" See \u00a7\u00a7 921.141(6)(g), (a) (Supp.1976-1977). In a similar vein the petitioner argues that it is not possible to make a rational determination whether there are \"sufficient\" aggravating circumstances that are not outweighed by the mitigating circumstances, since the state law assigns no specific weight to any of the various circumstances to be considered. See \u00a7 921.141 (Supp.1976-1977).\n\n\n37\nWhile these questions and decisions may be hard, they require no more line-drawing than is commonly required of a factfinder in a lawsuit. For example, juries have traditionally evaluated the validity of defenses such as insanity or reduced capacity, both of which involve the same considerations as some of the above-mentioned mitigating circumstances. While the various factors to be considered by the sentencing authorities do not have numerical weights assigned to them, the requirements of Furman are satisfied when the sentencing authority's discretion is guided and channeled by requiring examination of specific factors that argue in favor of or agast imposition of the death penalty, thus eliminating total arbitrariness and capriciousness in its imposition.\n\n\n38\nThe directions given to judge and jury by the Florida statute are sufficiently clear and precise to enable the various aggravating circumstances to be weighed against the mitigating ones. As a result, the trial court's sentencing discretion is guided and channeled by a system that focuses on the circumstances of each individual homicide and individual defendant in deciding whether the death penalty is to be imposed.\n\n\n39\n(c)\n\n\n40\nFinally, the Florida statute has a provision designed to assure that the death penalty will not be imposed on a capriciously selected group of convicted defendants. The Supreme Court of Florida reviews each death sentence to ensure that similar results are reached in similar cases.15\n\n\n41\nNonetheless the petitioner attacks the Florida appellate review process because the role of the Supreme Court of Florida in reviewing death sentences is necessarily subjective and unpredictable. While it may be true that that court has not chosen to formulate a rigid objective test as its standard of review for all cases, it does not follow that the appellate review process is ineffective or arbitrary. In fact, it is apparent that the Florida court has undertaken responsibly to perform its function of death sentence review with a maximum of rationality and consistency. For example, it has several times compared the circumstances of a case under review with those of previous cases in which it has assessed the imposition of death sentences. See, e. g., Alford v. State, 307 So.2d, at 445; Alvord v. State, 322 So.2d, at 540-541. By following this procedure the Florida court has in effect adopted the type of proportionality review mandated by the Georgia statute. Cf. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S., at 204-206, 96 S.Ct., at 2939-2941. And any suggestion that the Florida court gages in only cursory or rubber-stamp review of death penalty cases is totally controverted by the fact that it has vacated over one-third of the death sentences that have come before it. See supra, at 253.16\n\nIV\n\n42\nFlorida, like Georgia, has responded to Furman by enacting legislation that passes constitutional muster. That legislation provides that after a person is convicted of first-degree murder, there shall be an informed, focused, guided, and objective inquiry into the question whether he should be sentenced to death. If a death sentence is imposed, the sentencing authority articulates in writing the statutory reasons that led to its decision. Those reasons, and the evidence supporting them, are conscientiously reviewed by a court which, because of its statewide jurisdiction, can assure consistency, fairness, and rationality in the evenhanded operation of the state law. As in Georgia, this system serves to assure that sentences of death will not be \"wantonly\" or \"freakishly\" imposed. See Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S., at 310, 92 S.Ct., at 2762 (Stewart, J., concurring). Accordingly, the judgment before us is affirmed.\n\n\n43\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n44\nMr. Justice WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST join, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n45\nThere is no need to repeat the statement of the facts of this case and of the statutory procedure under which the death penalty was imposed, both of which are described in detail in the opinion of Mr. Justice STEWART, Mr. Justice POWELL, and Mr. Justice STEVENS. I agree with them, see Parts III-B(2)(a) and (b), Ante, at 255-258, that although the statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances are not susceptible of mechanical application, they are by no means so vague and overbroad as to leave the discretion of the sentencing authority unfettered. Under Florida law, the sentencing judge is Required to impose the death penalty on all first-degree murderers as to whom the statutory aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors. There is good reason to anticipate, then, that as to certain categories of murderers, the penalty will not be imposed freakishly or rarely but will be imposed with regularity; and consequently it cannot be said that the death penalty in Florida as to those categories has ceased \"to be a credible deterrent or measurably to contribute to any other end of punishment in the criminal justice system.\" Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 311, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 2763, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972) (White, J., concurring). Accordingly, the Florida statutory scheme for imposing the death penalty does not run afoul of thisourt's holding in Furman v. Georgia.\n\n\n46\nFor the reasons set forth in my opinion concurring in the judgment in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S., at 224-225, 96 S.Ct., at 2948-2949, and my dissenting opinion in Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U.S., at 348-350, 96 S.Ct., at 3013-3014, this conclusion is not undercut by the possibility that some murderers may escape the death penalty solely through exercise of prosecutorial discretion or executive clemency. For the reasons set forth in my dissenting opinion in Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U.S., at 350-356, 96 S.Ct., at 3014-3017, I also reject petitioner's argument that under the Eighth Amendment the death penalty may never be imposed under any circumstances.\n\n\n47\nI concur in the judgment of affirmance.\n\n\n48\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n49\nI concur in the judgment. See Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 405-414, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 2811-16, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972) (Blackmun, J., dissenting), and Id., at 375, 414, and 465, 92 S.Ct., at 2796, 2816, and 2841.\n\n\n\n1\n It appears that the \"ruler\" was actually the murder weapon which Medgebow had pulled from his own chest.\n\n\n2\n She described the attacker as wearing light pants and a pinstriped shirt with long sleeves rolled up to the elbow. She also stated that the attacker was a medium-sized white male.\n\n\n3\n See Infra, at 248-250.\n\n\n4\n The murder statute under which petitioner was convicted reads as follows:\n\"(1)(a) The unlawful killing of a human being, when perpetrated from a premeditated design to effect the death of the person killed or any human being, or when committed by a person engaged in the perpetration of, or in the attempt to perpetrate, any arson, involuntary sexual battery, robbery, burglary, kidnapping, aircraft piracy, or unlawful throwing, placing, or discharging of a destructive device or bomb, or which resulted from the unlawful distribution of heroin by a person 18 years of age or older when such drug is proven to be the proximate cause of the death of the user, shall be murder in the first degree and shall constitute a capital felony, punishable as provided in s. 775.082.\n\"(b) In all cases under this section, the procedure set forth in s. 921.141 shall be followed in order to determine sentence of death or life imprisonment.\" Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 782.04 (Supp.1976-1977).\nAnother Florida statute authorizes imposition of the death penalty upon conviction of sexual battery of a child under 12 years of age. \u00a7 794.011(2) (Supp.1976-1977). We do not in this opinion consider the constitutionality of the death penalty for any offense other than first-degree murder.\n\n\n5\n See Model Penal Code \u00a7 210.6 (Proposed Official Draft, 1962), (set out in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. at 193-194, 96 S.Ct., at 2935, n. 44).\n\n\n6\n The aggravating circumstances are:\n\"(a) The capital felony was committed by a person under sentence of imprisonment.\n\"(b) The defendant was previously convicted of another capital felony or of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person.\n\"(c) The defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons.\n\"(d) The capital felony was committed while the defendant was engaged, or was an accomplice, in the commission of, or an attempt\nto commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit, any robbery, rape, arson, burglary, kidnapping, or aircraft piracy or the unlawful throwing, placing, or discharging of a destructive device or bomb.\n\"(e) The capital felony was committed for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or effecting an escape from custody.\n\"(f) The capital felony was committed for pecuniary gain.\n\"(g) The capital felony was committed to disrupt or hinder the lawful exercise of any governmental function or the enforcement of laws.\n\"(h) The capital felony was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.\"\n\u00a7 921.141(5) (Supp.1976-1977).\nThe mitigating circumstances are:\n\"(a) The defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity.\n\"(b) The capital felony was committed while the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.\n\"(c) The victim was a participant in the defendant's conduct or consented to the act.\n\"(d) The defendant was an accomplice in the capital felony committed by another person and his participation was relatively minor.\n\"(e) The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the substantial domination of another person.\n\"(f) The capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired.\n\"(g) The age of the defendant at the time of the crime.\" \u00a7 921.141(6) (Supp.1976-1977).\n\n\n7\n Tedder has not always been cited when the Florida court has considered a judge-imposed death sentence following a jury recommendation of life imprisonment. See, E. g., Thompson v. State, 328 So.2d 1 (1976); Douglas v. State, 328 So.2d 18 (1976); Dobbert v. State, 328 So.2d 433 (1976). But in the latter case two judges relied on Tedder in separate opinions, one in support of reversing the death sentence and one in support of affirming it.\n\n\n8\n In one case the Florida court upheld a death sentence where the trial judge had simply listed six aggravating factors as justification for the sentence he imposed. Sawyer v. State, 313 So.2d 680 (1975). Since there were no mitigating factors, and since since some of these aggravating factors arguably fell within the statutory categories it is unclear whether the Florida court would uphold a death sentence that rested entirely on nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. It seems unlikely that it would do so since the capital-sentencing statute explicitly provides that \"(a)ggravating circumstances shall be Limited to the following (eight specified factors).\" \u00a7 921.141(5) (Supp.1976-1977). (Emphasis added.) There is no such limiting language introducing the list of statutory mitigating factors. See \u00a7 921.141(6) (Supp.1976-1977). See also n. 14 Infra.\n\n\n9\n Because the trial judge imposes sentence the Florida court has ruled that he may order preparation of a presentence investigation report to assist him in determining the appropriate sentence. See Swan v. State, 322 So.2d 485, 488-489 (1975); Songer v. State, 322 So.2d 481, 484 (1975). These reports frequently contain much information relevant to sentencing. See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S., at 189, 96 S.Ct., at 2933 n. 37.\n\n\n10\n See American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures \u00a7 1.1, Commentary, pp. 43-48 (Approved Draft); President's Commission on Law Enforcement & Administration of Justice: The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society, Task Force Report: The Courts 26 (1967). See also Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S., at 189-192, 96 S.Ct., at 2932-2934. In the words of the Florida Court, \"a trial judge with experience in the facts of criminality possesses the requisite knowledge to balance the facts of the case against the standard criminal activity which can only be developed by involvement with the trials of numerous defendants.\" State v. Dixon, 283 So.2d 1, 8 (1973).\n\n\n11\n As in Gregg, we examine the claims of vagueness and overbreadth in the statutory criteria only insofar as it is necessary to determine whether there is a substantial risk that the Florida capital-sentencing system, when viewed in its entirety, will result in the capricious or arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S., at 201, 96 S.Ct., at 2938 n. 51.\n\n\n12\n The Supreme Court of Florida has affirmed death sentences in several cases, including the instant case, where this eighth statutory aggravating factor was found, without specifically stating that the homicide was \"pitiless\" or \"torturous to the victim.\" See, E. g., Hallman v. State, 305 So.2d 180 (1974) (victim's throat slit with broken bottle); Spinkellink v. State, 313 So.2d 666 (1975) (\"career criminal\" shot sleeping traveling companion); Gardner v. State, 313 So.2d 675 (1975) (brutal beating and murder); Alvord v. State, 322 So.2d 533 (1975) (three women killed by strangulation, one raped); Douglas v. State, 328 So.2d 18 (1976) (depraved murder); Henry v. State, 328 So.2d 430 (1976) (torture murder); Dobbert v. State, 328 So.2d 433 (1976) (torture and killing of two children). But the circumstances of all of these cases could accurately be characterized as \"pitiless\" and \"unnecessarily torturous,\" and it thus does not appear that the Florida Court has abandoned the definition that it announced in Dixon and applied in Alford, Tedder, and Halliwell.\n\n\n13\n While it might be argued that this case broadens that construction, since only one person other than the victim was attacked at all and then only by being hit with a fist, this would be to read more into the State Supreme Court's opinion than is actually there. That court considered 11 claims of error advanced by the petitioner, including the trial judge's finding that none of the statutory mitigating circumstances existed. It did not, however, consider whether the findings as to each of the statutory aggravating circumstances were supported by the evidence. If only one aggravating circumstance had been found, or if some mitigating circumstance had been found to exist but not to outweigh the aggravating circumstances, we would be justified in concluding that the State Supreme Court had necessarily decided this point even though it had not expressly done so. However, in the circumstances of this case, when four separate aggravating circumstances were found and where each mitigating circumstance was expressly found Not to exist, no such holding on the part of the State Supreme Court can be implied.\n\n\n14\n The petitioner notes further that Florida's sentencing system fails to channel the discretion of the jury or judge because it allows for consideration of nonstatutory aggravating factors. In the only case to approve such a practice, Sawyer v. State, 313 So.2d 680 (1975), the Florida court recast the trial court's six nonstatutory aggravating factors into four aggravating circumstances two of them statutory. As noted earlier, it is unclear that the Florida court would ever approve a death sentence based entirely on nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. See n. 8, Supra.\n\n\n15\n State v. Dixon, 283 So.2d, at 10.\n\n\n16\n The petitioner also argues that since the Florida Court does not review sentences of life imprisonment imposed in capital cases or sentences imposed in cases where a capital crime was charged but where the jury convicted of a lesser offense, it will have an unbalanced view of the way that the typical jury treats a murder case and it will affirm death sentences under circumstances where the vast majority of judges would have imposed a sentence of life imprisonment. As we noted in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S., at 204, 96 S.Ct., at 2940 n. 56, this problem is not sufficient to raise a serious risk that the state capital-sentencing system will result in arbitrary and capricious imposition of the death penalty.\n\n\n","label":0}

Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973) violated his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because it prevented the sentencing judge from considering the particular circumstances of his crime and aspects of his character and record as mitigating factors.  Held:  The judgment is reversed insofar as it upholds the death penalty, and the case is remanded.  Pp. 642-643; 624-628; 643; 643-644.\n48 Ohio St.2d 270, 358 N.E.2d 556, reversed in part and remanded.\nMr. Chief Justice BURGER, joined by Mr. Justice STEWART, Mr. Justice POWELL, and Mr. Justice STEVENS, concluded:\n\n\n1\n1. \"The Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital case, not be precluded from considering as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's c aracter or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers.\"  Lockett v.

P. 642.\n\n\n3\nMr. Justice WHITE concluded that petitioner's death sentence should be vacated on the ground that the Ohio death penalty statute permits a defendant convicted of aggravated murder with specifications to be sentenced to death, as petitioner was in this case, without a finding that he intended death to result.  Pp. 624-628.\n\n\n4\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, being of the view that the death penalty is, under all circumstances, a cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, concurred in the judgment.  Pp. 643-644.\n\n\n5\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN concluded that petitioner's death sentence should be vacated on the ground that the Ohio death penalty statute is deficient in regards to petitioner, who was charged as an aider and abettor in a murder, in failing to allow consideration of the degree of petitioner's involvement, and the character of his mens rea, in the crime.  P. 643.\n\n\n6\nH. Fred Hoefle, Cincinnati, Ohio, for petitioner.\n\n\n7\nLeonard Kirschner, Cincinnati, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n\n8\nMr. Chief Justice BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to the facts of the case and the proceedings below (Part I), together with an opinion (Part II) in which Mr. Justice STEWART, Mr. Justice POWELL, and Mr. Justice STEVENS joined, on the constitutionality of the statute under which petitioner was sentenced to death, and announced the judgment of the Court.\n\n\n9\nWe granted certiorari in this case to consider whether the imposition of the death penalty upon Willie Lee Bell pursuant to Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2929.01-2929.04 (1975) violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n\n10\n* Bell was convicted of aggravated murder with the specification that the murder occurred in the course of a kidnaping.  He was sentenced to death.  433 U.S. 907, 97 S.Ct. 2971, 53 L.Ed.2d 1091 (1977).\n\n\n11\nOn October 16, 1974, Bell, who was then 16 years old, met a friend, Samuel Hall, who was then 18, at a youth center in Cincinnati, Ohio.  They left the center and went to Hall's home where Hall borrowed a car and proceeded to drive Bell around the area.  They followed a car driven by 64-year-old Julius Graber into a parking garage, and Hall, armed with a \"sawed off\" shotgun, forced Graber to surrender his car keys.  Graber was placed, unharmed, into the trunk of his own car.  Hall then drove Graber's car and Bell followed in Hall's car to the latter's home.  There, Bell got into Graber's car with Hall and, following Hall's directions, drove to a nearby cemetery.\n\n\n12\nA resident of an apartment near the cemetery saw Graber's car parked on the service road of the cemetery with its parking lights on.  He heard two car doors close and then a voice screaming, \"Don't shoot me, don't shoot me,\" followed by two shots.  He saw someone return to Graber's car and slide from the passenger's seat into the driver's seat.  After observing Graber's car proceed away with lights off\u2014he called the police.\n\n\n13\nThe police found Graber lying face down in the cemetery with a massive wound on the back of his head and another on his right cheek.  He died en route to the hospital.\n\n\n14\nAlthough Bell did not testify at his trial, he gave his version of the killing to the police after his arrest in a statement that was recorded and introduced at trial.  Bell denied any intention to participate in a killing.  He said that after he and Hall had parked in the cemetery, he had asked Hall what they were going to do next, and that Hall had replied:  \"We'll see. Give me the keys.\"  Hall then, according to Bell, released Graber from the trunk and marched him into a forested area to the rear of the cemetery out of Bell's sight.  Bell then heard Graber pleading for his life and heard a gunshot.  According to Bell, Hall then came back to the car, reloaded the gun, and returned to the wooded area.  Bell said he heard a second shot and Hall returned to the car and drove to Dayton, where they spent the night with friends of Hall.\n\n\n15\nThe next day, with Bell driving Graber's car, Bell and Hall stopped at a service station in Dayton.  Hall used the shotgun to obtain the keys to the attendant's car, and forced the attendant into the trunk.  Hall then drove the attendant's car away from the station with Bell following in Graber's car.  A patrolman stopped the car that Hall was driving for a defective muffler and discovered the attendant in the trunk.  Bell drove past Hall and the officer and returned to Cincinnati where he abandoned Graber's car.\n\n\n16\nAfter his arrest and indictment, Bell waived his right to a trial by jury and requested a trial by a three-judge panel.  The panel unanimously found him guilty of aggravated murder and of the specification that the murder occurred in the course of a kidnaping.  That offense required the death penalty under Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2929.03, 2929.04 (1975), which is set forth in the Appendix to our opinion in Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 609, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 2967, 57 L.Ed.2d 973, decided today.\n\n\n17\nPursuant to Ohio law, the panel ordered a presentence investigation and psychiatric examination of Bell.  The psychiatrists' report was directed specifically at the three mitigating factors and concluded that none of them were present. It also noted, however, that Bell claimed not to have been aware of what Hall was doing when he shot Graber.\n\n\n18\nThe presentence report contained detailed information about the offense and about Bell's background, intelligence, prior offenses, character, and habits.  It noted that Hall had accused Bell of actually firing the shotgun at Graber.  In addition to describing Bell as having \"low average or dull normal intellectual capability,\" it noted that Bell had been cited in juvenile court for a series of prior offenses and had allegedly been using mescaline on the night of the offense.\n\n\n19\nThe three-judge panel permitted both sides the opportunity to introduce evidence and make arguments regarding the proper penalty.  Bell testified that he had been under the influence of drugs virtually every day for three years prior to his arrest and on the night of the killing.  He also said that he had viewed Hall as a \"big brother\" and had followed Hall's instructions because he had been \"scared.\"  Several of Bell's teachers testified that Bell had a drug problem and was emotionally unstable and immature for his age.\n\n\n20\nThe defense argued that Bell had acted out of fear and coercion and that the offense was due to Bell's mental deficiency. In support of his contention that Bell was mentally deficient, defense counsel argued that Bell's minority established mental deficiency as a matter of law;  he also argued that Bell was mentally deficient compared to other teenagers because of his drug problem and emotional instability and that Bell's mental deficiency contributed to his passive part in the crime.\n\n\n21\nPrior to sentencing, Bell moved that the Ohio death penalty be declared unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, contending that the Ohio death penalty statute, which had been enacted after Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972), severely limited the factors that would support an argument for mercy.  Bell contended that his youth, the fact that he cooperated with the police, and the lack of proof that he had participated in the actual killing strongly supported an argument for a penalty less than death in this case. He also contended that Ohio's post-Furman death penalty statute precluded him from requesting a lesser sentence on the basis of those factors.\n\n\n22\nAfter considering the presentence and psychiatric reports as well as oth r evidence and the arguments of counsel, the panel concluded that none of the mitigating circumstances defined by the Ohio statute had been established.  Accordingly, Bell was sentenced to death.\n\n\n23\nIn the Ohio Supreme Court, Bell unsuccessfully renewed his contention that the Ohio death penalty violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  He also contended, among other things, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for aggravated murder because there was no proof that he had intended to kill or that he had aided and abetted Hall with the intent that Graber be killed.  That court rejected these arguments and held that the evidence that Bell had aided and abetted was sufficient to sustain the conviction because, under Ohio law, an aider and abettor could be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.  Alternatively, the court concluded that the trial panel might have reasonably concluded that Bell either committed or actively assisted in the murder.\n\nII\n\n24\nBell contends that the Ohio death penalty statute violated his rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because it prevented the sentencing judges from considering the particular circumstances of his crime and aspects of his character and record as mitigating factors.  For the reasons stated in Part III of our opinion in Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S., at 597-609, 98 S.Ct., at 2961-2967, we have concluded that \"the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital case, not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers.\"  438 U.S., at 604, 98 S.Ct., at 2965.  We also concluded that \"[t]he Ohio death penalty statute does not permit the type of individualized consideration of mitigating factors,\" 438 U.S., at 606, 98 S.Ct., at 2965, that is required by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  We therefore agree with Bell's contention.*\n\n\n25\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Ohio Supreme Court is reversed to the extent that it upholds the imposition of the death penalty, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.\n\n\n26\nMr. Justice BRENNAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n27\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n28\nI join Part I of the Court's opinion and concur in the judgment.  In accord with my views stated separately in Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S 586, 613, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 2969, 57 L.Ed.2d 973, I would reverse the judgment of the Ohio Supreme Court insofar as it upheld the imposition of the death penalty on petitioner Bell. Petitioner was charged, inter alia, as an aider and abettor in the murder of Julius Graber, and the trial court's judgment was sustained on that basis by the Ohio Supreme Court.  48 Ohio St.2d 270, 278, 358 N.E.2d 556, 563 (1976).  Accordingly, I would find the Ohio capital penalty statute deficient in failing to allow consideration of the degree of petitioner's involvement, and the character of his mens rea,  in the crime.\n\n\n29\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n30\nI continue to believe that the death penalty is, under all circumstances a cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 314-374, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 2764-2796, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972) (MARSHALL, J., concurring);  Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 231-241, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 2973-2977, 49 L.Ed.2d 859, 904 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), and thus disagree with the Court's assumption to the contrary.  See Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 619, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 2972, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in judgment).  I join in the Court's judgment insofar as it requires that petitioner's death sentence be vacated.\n\n\n31\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting.\n\n\n32\nFor the reasons stated in my concurring and dissenting opinion in Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 628, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 2973, 57 L.Ed.2d 973, I would affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio in this case.  I therefore dissent from the Court's judgment reversing it.\n\n\n\n*\n In view of our conclusion that Bell's death sentence cannot stand due to the Ohio statute's limits on the consideration of mitigating circumstances, we do not address (a) Bell's contention that the death penalty is disproportionate as applied in this case or (b) his contentions that the Ohio capital sentencing procedure violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because of an alleged lack of meaningful appellate review, because the jury does not participate in sentencing, and because the defendant must bear the risk of nonpersuasion as to the existence of mitigating factors.  Nor do we reach Bell's contention that the procedure under which he was tried and sentenced infringed his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Our grant of certiorari in this case was limited to Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment issues. See 433 U.S. 907, 97 S.Ct. 2971, 53 L.Ed.2d 1091 (1977).\n\n\n","label":0}

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit refused the writ, holding that the trial judge had acted within his proper discretion in denying petitioner's request for a jury. 252 F.2d 864. We granted certiorari, 356 U.S. 956, 78 S.Ct. 996, 2 L.Ed.2d 1064, because 'Maintenance of the jury as a fact-finding body is of such importance and occupies so firm a place in our history and jurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the right to a jury trial should be scrutinized with the utmost care.' Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486, 55 S.Ct. 296, 301, 79 L.Ed. 603.\n\n\n2\nFox had asked for declaratory relief against Beacon alleging a controversy arising under the Sherman Antitrust Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, and under the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 15, which authorizes suits for treble damages against Sherman Act violators. According to the complaint Fox operates a movie theatre in San Bernardino, California, and has long been exhibiting films under contracts with movie distributors. These contracts grant if the exclusive right to show 'first run' pictures in the 'San Bernardino competitive area' and provide for 'clearance'\u2014a period of time during which no other theatre can exhibit the same pictures. After building a drive-in theatre about 11 miles from San Bernardino, Beacon notified Fox that it considered contracts barring simultaneous exhibitions of first-run films in the two theatres to be overt acts in violation of the antitrust laws.1 Fox's complaint alleged that this notification, together with threats of treble damage suits against Fox and its distributors, gave rise to 'duress and coercion' which deprived Fox of a valuable property right, the right to negotiate for exclusive first-run contracts. Unless Beacon was restrained, the complaint continued, irreparable harm would result. Accordingly, while its pleading was styled a 'Complaint for Declaratory Relief,' Fox prayed both for a declaration that a grant of clearance between the Fox and Beacon theatres is reasonable and not in violation of the antitrust laws, and for an injunction, pending final resolution of the litigation, to prevent Beacon from instituting any action under the antitrust laws against Fox and its distributors arising out of the controversy alleged in the complaint.2 Beacon filed an answer, a counterclaim against Fox, and a cross-claim against an exhibitor who had intervened. These denied the threats and asserted that there was no substantial competition between the two theatres, that the clearances granted were therefore unreasonable, and that a conspiracy existed between Fox and its distributors to manipulate contracts and clearances so as to restrain trade and monopolize first-run pictures in violation of the antitrust laws. Treble damages were asked.\n\n\n3\nBeacon demanded a jury trial of the factul i ssues in the case as provided by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38(b), 28 U.S.C.A. The District Court, however, viewed the issues raised by the 'Complaint for Declaratory Relief,' including the question of competition between the two theatres, as essentially equitable. Acting under the purported authority of Rules 42(b) and 57, it directed that these issues be tried to the court before jury determination of the validity of the charges of antitrust violations made in the counterclaim and cross-claim.3 A common issue of the 'Complaint for Declaratory Relief,' the counterclaim, and the cross-claim was the reasonableness of the clearances granted to Fox, which depended, in part, on the existence of competition between the two theatres. Thus the effect of the action of the District Court could be, as the Court of Appeals believed, 'to limit the petitioner's opportunity fully to try to a jury every issue which has a bearing upon its treble damage suit,' for determination of the issue of clearances by the judge might 'operate either by way of res judicata or collateral estoppel so as to conclude both parties with respect thereto at the subsequent trial of the treble damage claim.' 252 F.2d at page 874.\n\n\n4\nThe District Court's finding that the Complaint for Declaratory Relief presented basically equitable issues draws no support from the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201, 2202, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2201, 2202; Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 57.

That statute, while allowing prospective defendants to sue to establish their nonliability, specifically preserves the right to jury trial for both parties.4 It follows that if Beacon would have been entitled to a jury trial in a treble damage suit against Fox it cannot be deprived of that right merely because Fox took advantage of the availability of declaratory relief to sue Beacon first. Since the right to trial by jury applies to treble damage suits under the antitrust laws, and is, in fact, an essential part of the congressional plan for making competition rather than monopoly the rule of trade, see Fleitmann v. Welsbach Street Lighting Co., 240 U.S. 27, 29, 36 S.Ct. 233, 234, 60 L.Ed. 505, the Sherman and Clayton Act issues on which Fox sought a declaration were essentially jury questions.\n\n\n5\nNevertheless the Court of Appeals refused to upset the order of the district judge. It held that the question of whether a right to jury trial existed was to be judged by Fox's complaint read as a whole. In addition to seeking a declaratory judgment, the court said, Fox's complaint can be read as making out a valid plea for injunctive relief, thus stating a claim traditionally cognizable in equity. A party who is entitled to maintain a suit in equity for an injunction, said the court, may have all the issues in his suit determined by the judge without a jury regardless of whether legal rights are involved. The court then rejected the argument that equitable relief, traditionally available only when legal remedies are inadequate, was rendered unnecessary in this case by the filing of the counterclaim and cross-claim which presented all the issues necessary to a determination of the right to injunctive relief. Relying on American Life Ins. Co. v. Stewart, 300 U.S. 203 21 5, 57 S.Ct. 377, 380, 81 L.Ed. 605, decided before the enactment of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it invoked the principle that a court sitting in equity could retain jurisdiction even though later a legal remedy became available. In such instances the equity court had discretion to enjoin the later lawsuit in order to allow the whole dispute to be determined in one case in one court.5 Reasoning by analogy, the Court of Appeals held it was not an abuse of discretion for the district judge, acting under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(b), to try the equitable cause first even though this might, through collateral estoppel, prevent a full jury trial of the counterclaim and cross-claim which were as effectively stopped as by an equity injunction.6\n\n\n6\nBeacon takes issue with the holding of the Court of Appeals that the complaint stated a claim upon which equitable relief could be granted. As initially filed the complaint alleged that threats of lawsuits by petitioner against Fox and its distributors were causing irreparable harm to Fox's business relationships. The prayer for relief, however, made no mention of the threats but asked only that pending litigation of the claim for declaratory judgment, Beacon be enjoined from beginning any lawsuits under the antitrust laws against Fox and its distributors arising out of the controversy alleged in the complaint. Evidently of the opinion that this prayer did not state a good claim for equitable relief, the Court of Appeals construed it to include a request for an injunction against threats of lawsuits. This liberal construction of a pleading is in line with Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47\u201448, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102\u2014103, 2 L.Ed.2d 80. But this fact does not solve our problem. Assuming that the pleadings can be construed to support such a request and assuming additionally that the complaint can be read as alleging the kind of harassment by a multiplicity of lawsuits which would traditionally have justified equity to take jurisdiction and settle the case in one suit,7 we are nevertheless of the opinion that, under the Declaratory Judgment Act and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, neither claim can justify denying Beacon a trial by jury of all the issues in the antitrust controversy.\n\n\n7\nThe basis of injunctive relief in the federal courts has always been irreparable harm and inadequacy of legal remedies.8 At least as much is required to justify a trial court in using its discretion under the Federal Rules to allow claims of equitable origins to be tried ahead of legal ones, since this has the same effect as an equitable injunction of the legal claims. And it is immaterial, in judging if that discretion is properly employed,tha t before the Federal Rules and the Declaratory Judgment Act were passed, courts of equity, exercising a jurisdiction separate from courts of law, were, in some cass, allowed to enjoin subsequent legal actions between the same parties involving the same controversy. This was because the subsequent legal action, though providing an opportunity to try the case to a jury, might not protect the right of the equity plaintiff to a fair and orderly adjudication of the controversy. See, e.g., New York Lie Ins. Co. v. Seymour, 6 Cir., 45 F.2d 47, 73 A.L.R. 1523. Under such circumstances the legal remedy could quite naturally be deemed inadequate. Inadequacy of remedy and irreparable harm are practical terms, however. As such their existence today must be determined, not by precedents decided under discarded procedures, but in the light of the remedies now made available by the Declaratory Judgment Act and the Federal Rules.9\n\n\n8\nViewed in this manner, the use of discretion by the trial court under Rule 42(b) to deprive Beacon of a full jury trial on its counterclaim and cross-claim, as well as on Fox's plea for declaratory relief, cannot be justified. Under the Federal Rules the same court may try both legal and equitable causes in the same action. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc., 1, 2, 18. Thus any defenses, equitable or legal, Fox may have to charges of antitrust violations can be raised either in its suit for declaratory relief or in answer to Beacon's counterclaim. On proper showing, harassment by threats of other suits, or other suits actually brought, involving the issues being tried in this case, could be temporarily enjoined pending the outcome of this litigation. Whatever permanent injunctive relief Fox might be entitled to on the basis of the decision in this case could, of course, be given by the court after the jury renders its verdict. In this way the issues between these parties could be settled in one suit giving Beacon a full jury trial of every antitrust issue. Cf. Ring v. Spina, 2 Cir., 166 F.2d 546. By contrast, the holding of the court below while granting Fox no additional protection unless the avoidance of jury trial be considered as such, would compel Beacon to split his antitrust case, trying part to a judge and part to a jury.10 Such a result, which involves the postponement and subordination of Fox's own legal claim for declaratory relief as well as of the counterclaim which Beacon was compelled by the Federal Rules to bring,11 is not permissible.\n\n\n9\nOur decision is consistent with the plan of the Federal Rules and the Declaratory Judgment Act to effect substantia pr ocedural reform while retaining a distinction between jury and nonjury issues and leaving substantive rights unchanged.12 Since in the federal courts equity has always acted only when legal remedies were inadequate,13 the expansion of adequate legal remedies provided by the Declaratory Judgment Act and the Federal Rules necessarily affects the scope of equity. Thus, the justification for equity's deciding legal issues once it obtains jurisdiction, and refusing to dismiss a case, merely because subsequently a legal remedy becomes available, must be re-evaluated in the light of the liberal joinder provisions of the Federal Rules which allow legal and equitable causes to be brought and resolved in one civil action.14 Similarly the need for, and therefore, the availability of such equitable remedies as Bills of Peace, Quia Timet and Injunction must be reconsidered in view of the existence of the Declaratory Judgment Act as well as the liberal joinder provision of the Rules.15 This is not only in accord with the spirit of the Rules and the Act but is required by the provision in the Rules that '(t)he right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution or as given by a statute of the United States shall be preserved * * * inviolate.'16\n\n\n10\nIf there should be cases where the availability of declaratory judgment or joinder in one suit of legal and equitable causes would not in all respects protect the plaintiff seeking equitable relief from irreparable harm while affording a jury trial in the legal cause, the trial court will necessarily have to use its discretion in deciding whether the legal or equitable cause should be tried first. Since the right to jury trial is a constitutional one, however, while no similar requirement protects trials by the court,17 that discretion is very narrowly limited and must, wherever possible, be exercised to preserve jury trial. As this Court said in Scott v. Neely, 140 U.S. 106, 109\u2014110, 11 S.Ct. 712, 714, 35 L.Ed. 358: 'In the Federal courts this (jury) right cannot be dispensed with, except by the assent of the parties entitled to it; nor can it be impaired by any blending with a claim, properly cognizable at law, of a demand for equitable relief in aid of the legal action, or during its pendency.'18 This long-standing principle of equity dictates that only under the most imperative circumstances, circumstances which in view of the flexible procedures of the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate,19 can the right to a jury trial of legal issues be lost through prior determination of equitable claims. See Leimer v. Woods, 8 Cir., 196 F.2d 828, 833\u2014836. We as have shown, this is far from being such a case.\n\n\n11\nRespondent claims mandamus is not available under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1651. Whatever differences of opinion there may be in other types of cases, we think the right to grant mandamus to require jury trial where it has been improperly denied is settled.20\n\n\n12\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\n\n\n13\nReversed.\n\n\n14\nMr. Justice FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n15\nMr. Justice STEWART, with whom Mr. Justice HARLAN and Mr. Justice WHITTAKER concur, dissenting.\n\n\n16\nThere can be no doubt that a litigant is entitled to a writ of mandamus to protect a clear constitutional or statutory right to a jury trial. But there was no denial of such a right here. The district judge simply exercised his inherent discretion, now explicitly confirmed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to schedule the trial of an equitable claim in advance of an action at law. Even an abuse of such discretion could not, I think, be attacked by the extraordinary writ of mandamus.1 In any event no abuse of discretion is apparent in this case.\n\n\n17\nThe complaint filed by Fox stated a claim traditionally cognizable in equity. That claim, in brief, was that Beacon had wrongfully interfered with the right of Fox to compete freely with Beacon and other distributors for the licensing of films for first-run exhibition in the San Bernardino area. The complaint alleged that the plaintiff was without an adequate remedy at law and would be irreparably harmed unless the defendant were restrained from continuing to interfere\u2014by coercion and threats of litigation\u2014with the plaintiff's lawful business relationships.\n\n\n18\nThe Court of Appeals found that the complaint, although inartistically drawn, contained allegations entitling the petitioner to equitable relief.2 That finding is accepted in the prevailing opinion today. If the complaint had been answered simply by a general denial, therefore, the issues would under traditional principles have been triable as a proceeding in equity. Instead of just puting  in issue the allegations of the complaint, however, Beacon filed pleadings which affirmatively alleged the existence of a broad conspiracy among the plaintiff and other theatre owners to monopolize the first-run exhibition of films in the San Bernardino area to refrain from competing among themselves, and to discriminate against Beacon in granting film licenses. Based upon these allegations, Beacon asked damages in the amount of $300,000. Clearly these conspiracy allegations stated a cause of action triable as of right by a jury. What was demanded by Beacon, however, was a jury trial not only of this cause of action, but also of the issues presented by the original complaint.\n\n\n19\nUpon motion of Fox the trial judge ordered the original action for declaratory and equitable relief to be tried separately to the court and in advance of the trial of the defendant's counter-claim and cross-claim for damages. The court's order, which carefully preserved the right to trial by jury upon the conspiracy and damage issues raised by the counterclaim and cross-claim, was in conformity with the specific provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.3 Yet it is decided today that the Court of Appeals must compel the district judge to rescind it.\n\n\n20\nAssuming the existence of a factual issue common both to the plaintiff's original action and the defendant's counterclaim for damages, I cannot agree that the District Court must be compelled to try the counterclaim first.4 It is, of course, a matter of no great moment in what order the issues between the parties in the present litigation are tried. What is disturbing is the process by which the Court arrives at its decision\u2014a process which appears to disregard the historic relationship between equity and law.\n\nI.\n\n21\nThe Court suggests that 'the expansion of adequate legal remedies provided by the Declaratory Judgment Act * * * necessarily affects the scope of equity.' Does the Court mean to say that the mere availability of an action for a declaratory judgment operates to furnish 'an adequate remedy at law' so as to deprive a court of equity of the power to act? That novel line of reasoning is at least implied in the Court's opinion. But the Declaratory Judgment Act did not 'expand' the substantive law. That Act merely provided a new statutory remedy, neither legal nor equitable, but available in the areas of both equity and law. When declaratory relief is sought, the right to trial by jury depends upon the basic context in which the issues are presented. See Moore's Federal Practice (2d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 38.29, 57.30; Borchard, Declaratory Judgments (2d ed.), 399\u2014404. If the basic issues in an action for declaratory relief are of a kind traditionally cognizable in equity, e.g., a suit for cancellation of a written instrument, the declaratory judgment is not a 'remedy at law.'5 If, on the other hand, the issues arise in a context traditionally cognizable at common law, the right to a jury trial of course remains unimpaired, even though the only relief demanded is a declaratory judgment.6\n\n\n22\nThus, if in this case the complaint had asked merely for a judgment declaring that the plaintiff's specified manner of business dealings with distributors and other exhibitors did not render it liable to Beacon under the antitrust laws, this would have been simply a 'juxtaposition of parties' case in which Beacon could have demanded a jury trial.7 But the complaint in the present case, as the Court recognizes, presented issues of exclusively equitable cognizance, going well beyond a mere defense to any subsequent action at law. Fox sought from the court protection against Beacon's allegedly unlawful interference with its business relationships\u2014protection which this Court seems to recognize might not have been afforded by a declaratory judgment, unsupplemented by equitable relief. The availability of a declaratory judgment did not, therefore, operate to confer upon Beacon the right to trial by jury with respect to the issues raised by the complaint.\n\nII.\n\n23\nThe Court's opinion does not, of course, hold or even suggest that a court of equity may never determine 'legal rights.' For indeed it is precisely such rights which the Chancellor, when his jurisdictio has been properly invoked, has often been called upon to decide. Issues of fact are rarely either 'legal' or 'equitable.' All depends upon the context in which they arise. The examples cited by Chief Judge Pope in his thorough opinion in the Court of Appeals in this case are illustrative: '* * * (I)n a suit by one in possession of real property to quiet title, or to remove a cloud on title, the court of equity may determine the legal title. In a suit for specific performance of a contract, the court may determine the making, validity and the terms of the contract involved. In a suit for an injunction against trespass to real property the court may determine the legal right of the plaintiff to the possession of that property. Cf. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence, 5th ed., \u00a7\u00a7 138\u2014221, 221a, 221b, 221d, 250.' 252 F.2d 864, 874.\n\n\n24\nThough apparently not disputing these principles, the Court holds, quite apart from its reliance upon the Declaratory Judgment Act, that Beacon by filing its counterclaim and cross-claim acquired a right to trial by jury of issues which otherwise would have been properly triable to the court. Support for this position is found in the principle that, 'in the federal courts equity has always acted only when legal remedies were inadequate. * * *' Yet that principle is not employed in its traditional sense as a limitation upon the exercise of power by a court of equity. This is apparent in the Court's recognition that the allegations of the complaint entitled Fox to equitable relief relief to which Fox would not have been entitled if it had had an adequate remedy at law. Instead, the principle is employed today to mean that because it is possible under the counterclaim to have a jury trial of the factual issue of substantial competition, that issue must be tried by a jury, even though the issue was primarily presented in the original claim for equitable relief. This is a marked departure from long-settled principles.\n\n\n25\nIt has been an established rule 'that equitable jurisdiction existing at the filing of a bill is not destroyed because an adequate legal remedy may have become available thereafter.'8 American Life Ins. Co. v. Stewart, 300 U.S. 203, 215, 57 S.Ct. 377, 380, 81 L.Ed. 605. See Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., 255 U.S. 288, 296, 41 S.Ct. 272, 275, 65 L.Ed. 638. It has also been long settled that the District Court in its discretion may order the trial of a suit in equity in advance of an action at law between the same parties, even if there is a factual issue common to both. In the words of Mr. Justice Cardozo, writing for a unanimous Court in American Life Ins. Co. v. Stewart, supra:\n\n\n26\n'A court has control over its own docket. * * * In the      exercise of a sound discretion it may hold one lawsuit in      abeyance to abide the outcome of another, especially where      the parties and the issues are the same. * * * If request had      been made by the respondents to suspend the suits in equity      till the other causes were disposed of, the District Court      could have considered whether justice would not be done by pursuing such a course, the remedy in equity being      exceptional and the outcome of necessity. * * * There would      be many circumstances to be weighed, as, for instance, the      condition of the court calendar, whether the insurer had been      precipitate or its adversaries dilatory, as well as other      factors. In the end, benefit and hardship would have to be      set off, the one against the other, and a balance      ascertained.' 300 U.S. 203, 215\u2014216, 57 S.Ct. 377, 380.9\n\nIII.\n\n27\nThe Court today sweeps away these basic principles as 'precedents decided under discarded procedures.' It suggests that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have somehow worked an 'expansion of adequate legal remedies' so as to oust the District Courts of equitable jurisdiction, as well as to deprive them of their traditional power to control their own dockets. But obviously the Federal Rules could not and did not 'expand' the substantive law one whit.10\n\n\n28\nLike the Declaratory Judgment Act, the Federal Rules preserve inviolate the right to trial by jury in actions historically cognizable at common law, as under the Constitution they must.11 They do not create a right of trial by jury where that right 'does not exist under the Constitution or statutes of the United States.' Rule 39(a). Since Beacon's counterclaim was compulsory under the Rules, see Rule 13(a), it is apparent that by filing it Beacon could not be held to have waived its jury rights.12 Compare American Mills Co. v. American Surety Co., 260 U.S. 360, 43 S.Ct. 149, 67 L.Ed. 306. But neither can the counterclaim be held to have transformed Fox's original complaint into an action at law.13 See Bendix Aviation Corp. v. Glass, D.C., 81 F.Supp. 645.\n\n\n29\nThe Rules make possible the trial of legal and equitable claims in the same proceeding, but they expressly affirm the power of a trial judge to determine the order in which claims shall be heard. Rule 42(b). Certainly the Federal Rules were not intended to undermine the basic structure of equity jurisprudence, developed over the centuries and explicitly recognized in the United States Constitution.14\n\n\n30\nFor these reasons I think the petition for a writ of mandamus should have been dismissed.\n\n\n\n1\n Beacon allegedly stated that the clearances granted violated both the antitrust laws and the decrees issued in United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., D.C., 66 F.Supp. 323; 70 F.Supp. 53, affirmed in part and reversed in part, 334 U.S. 131, 68 S.Ct. 915, 92 L.Ed. 1260, subsequent proceedings in the District Court, 85 F.Supp. 881. The decrees in that case set limits on what clearances could be given when theatres were in competition with each other and held that there should be no clearances between theatres not in substantial competition. Neither Beacon nor Fox, however, appears to have been a party to those decrees. Their relevance, therefore, seems to be only that of significant precedents.\n\n\n2\n Other prayers aside from the general equitable plea for 'such further relief as the court deems proper' added nothing material to those set out.\n\n\n3\n Fed.Rules Civ.Proc., 42(b) reads: 'The court in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice may order a separate trial of any claim, cross-claim, counter-claim, or third-party claim, or of any separate issue or of any number of claims, cross-claims, counterclaims, third-party claims, or issues.' Rule 57 reads in part: 'The court may order a speedy hearing of an action for a declaratory judgment and may advance it on the calendar.'\n\n\n4\n See, e.g., (American) Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. of Illinois v. Timms & Howard, Inc., 2 Cir., 108 F.2d 497; Hargrove v. American Cent. Ins. Co., 10 Cir., 125 F.2d 225; Johnson v. Fidelity & Casualty Co., 8 Cir., 238 F.2d 322.

In City of Morgantown, W. Va. v. Royal Ins. Co., 337 U.S. 254, 69 S.Ct. 1067, 93 L.Ed. 1347, the Court denied at least some such orders the status of injunctions for the purposes of appealability.

The Seventh Amendment reads: 'In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.'\n\n\n17\n See Hurwitz v. Hurwitz, 78 U.S.App.D.C. 66, 136 F.2d 796, 798\u2014799, 148 A.L.R. 226; cf. The Genesee Chief v.

The court in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice may order a separate trial of any claim, cross-claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, or of any separate issue or of any number of claims, cross-claims, counterclaims, third-party claims, or issues.'\nThe Note to Rule 39 of the Advisory Committee on Rules states that, 'When certain of the issues are to be tried by jury and others by the court, the court may determine the sequence in which such issues shall be tried.' This language was at one time contained in a draft of the Rules, but was deleted because 'the power is adequately given by Rule 42(b) * * *.' Moore's Federal Practice (2d. ed.) \u00a7 39.12, n. 8.\nSee also Rule 57, which provides, inter alia, that 'The court may order a speedy hearing of an action for a declaratory judgment and may advance it on the calendar.'\n\n\n4\n It is not altogether clear at this stage of the proceedings whether the existence of substantial competition between Fox and Beacon is actually a material issue of fact common to both the equitable claim and the counterclaim for damages. The respondent ingeniously argues that determination in the equitable suit of the issue of competition between the theatres would be determinative of little or nothing in the counterclaim for damages.\n'The fact issue in the action for equitable and declaratory relief is whether the Fox West Coast California Theatre and the Petitioner's drive-in are substantially competitive with each other. The fact issue in the counterclaim is whether the cross-defendants and co-conspirators therein named conspired together in restraint of trade and to monopolize in the manner alleged in the counterclaim. Absent conspiracy, whether or not the distributors licensed a single first run picture to Petitioner's drive-in, be it in substnti al competition or not in substantial competition with other first run theatres in the San Bernardino area, Petitioner will not have made out a case on its counterclaim. * * * If Petitioner on its counterclaim should fail to prove conspiracy the issue of competition between the theatres is meaningless. If petitioner on the other hand success in proving the allegations of its counterclaim, the conspiracy to monopolize first run and to discriminate against the new drivein, the existence or non-existence of competition between the theatres would exculpate none of the alleged wrongdoers, although if there was an absence of competition between the drive-in and the other first run theatres, as Petitioner contended in its answer to the complaint, it might have some difficulty proving injury to its business.'\n\n\n5\n State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Mossey, 7 Cir., 195 F.2d 56, 60; Connecticut General Life Ins. Co. v. Candimat Co., D.C., 83 F.Supp. 1.\n\n\n6\n Dickinson v. General Accident F. & L. Assur. Corp., 9 Cir., 147 F.2d 396; Hargrove v. American Cent. Ins. Co., 10 Cir., 125 F.2d 225; Pacific Indemnity Co. v. McDonald, 9 Cir., 107 F.2d 446, 131 A.L.R. 208.\n\n\n7\n Moore's Federal Practice (2d ed.) \u00a7 57.31(2). 'Transposition of parties' would perhaps be a more accurate description. A typical such case is one in which a plaintiff uses the declaratory judgment procedure to seek a determination of nonliability to a legal claim asserted by the defendant. The defendant in such a case is, of course, entitled to a jury trial.\n\n\n8\n The suggestion by the Court that 'This was because the subsequent legal action, though providing an opportunity to try the case to a jury, might not protect the right of the equity plaintiff to a fair and orderly adjudication of the controversy' is plainly inconsistent with many of the cases in which the rule has been applied. See, e.g., Beedle v. Bennett, 122 U.S. 71, 7 S.Ct. 1090, 30 L.Ed. 1074; Clark v. Wooster, 119 U.S. 332, 7 S.Ct. 217, 30 L.Ed. 392.\n\n\n9\n  It is arguable that if a case factually similar to American Life Ins. Co. v. Stewart were to arise under the Declaratory Judgment Act, the defendant would be entitled to a jury trial. See footnote 7. But cf. 5 Moore's Federal Practice (2d ed.), p. 158.\n\n\n10\n Congressional authorization of the Rules expressly provided that 'Said rules shall neither abridge, enlarge, nor modify the substantive rights of any litigant.' 48 Stat. 1064. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2072.\n\n\n11\n 'In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.' U.S.Const., Amend. VII. See Rules 38, 39, Fed.Rules Civ.Proc.\n\n\n12\n This is not, of course, to suggest that the filing of a permissive 'legal' counterclaim to an 'equitable' complaint would amount to a waiver of jury rights on the issues raised by the counterclaim.\n\n\n13\n Determination of whether a claim stated by the complaint is triable by the court or by a jury will normally not be dependent upon the 'legal' or 'equitable' character of the counterclaim. See Borchard, Declaratory Judgments (2d ed.), p. 404. There are situations, however, such as a case in which the plaintiff seeks a declaration of invalidity or non-infringement of a patent, in which the relief sought by the counterclaim will determine the nature of the entire case. See Moore's Federal Practice (2d ed.) \u00a7 38.29.\n\n\n14\n 'The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity. * * *' Art. III, \u00a7 2.\n\n\n","label":0}

Siegel, Brooklyn, N.Y., for respondent.\nMr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nCamilo Leyra, age 75, and his wife, age 80, were found dead in their Brooklyn apartment. Several days later petitioner, their son, age 50, was indicted in a state court charged with having murdered them with a hammer. He was convicted and sentenced to death, chiefly on several alleged confessions of guilt. The New York Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that one of the confessions, made to a state-employed psychiatrist, had been extorted from petitioner by coercion and promises of leniency in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.1 People v. Leyra, 302 N.Y. 353, 98 N.E.2d 553. Petitioner was then tried again. This time the invalidated confession was not used to convict him but several other confessions that followed it the same day were used. Petitioner objected to the admission of these other confessions on the ground that they were also coerced, but the trial court submitted to the jury the question of their 'voluntariness.' The jury convicted and the death sentence now before us was imposed.2 The New York Court of Appeals, holding that there was evidence to support a finding that the confessions used were free from the coercive influences of the one previously given the psychiatrist, affirmed, Judge Fuld and the late Chief Judge Loughran dissenting. People v. Leyra, 304 N.Y. 468, 108 N.E.2d 673. We denied certiorari. 345 U.S. 918, 73 S.Ct. 730, 97 L.Ed. 1351. Petitioner then filed this habeas corpus proceeding in a United States District Court, charging that the confessions used against him had been coerced, depriving him of due process of law. The District Court properly gave consideration to the petition, Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 73 S.Ct. 397, 437, 97 L.Ed. 469, but denied it. 113 F.Supp. 556. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, Judge Frank dissenting. 208 F.2d 605. Petitioner then sought review in this Court, again urging that he was denied due process on the ground that his confessions to a police captain and to two assistant state prosecutors were forced. We granted certiorari because the constitutional question appeared substantial. 347 U.S. 926, 74 S.Ct. 533.\n\n\n2\nThe use in a state criminal trial of a defendant's confession obtained by coercion\u2014whether physical or mental\u2014is forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment.3 The question for our decision is therefore whether the present confessions were so coerced. This question can only be answered by reviewing the circumstances surrounding the confessions. We therefore examine the circumstances as shown by the undisputed facts of this case.\n\n\n3\nWhen the father failed to appear at his place of business on Tuesday, January 10, 1950, petitioner, his business partner, and others went to the father's apartment about 3 p.m. and found the bodies of the aged parents. Police were called. Although they first suspected a prowling intruder, the presence on the couple's disarranged breakfast table of a third teacup led them to think that the killer was a welcome guest. This and other circumstances drew suspicion toward petitioner. He and others were questioned by the police until about 11 p.m. on the evening of the day the bodies were discovered. On Wednesday, police again questioned petitioner from about 10 in the morning to midnight. Once more, beginning about 9 Thursday morning petitioner was subjected to almost constant police questioning throughout the day and much of the night until about 8:30 Friday morning. At that time petitioner was taken by police to his partents' funeral. While petitioner was at the funeral and until he returned in the late afternoon, Captain Meenahan, his chief police questioner, went home to get some 'rest.' After the funeral petitioner himself was permitted to go to a hotel and sleep an hour and a half. He was returned to the police station about 5 p.m. on this Friday afternoon. During his absence a concealed microphone had been installed with wire connections to another room in which the state prosecutor, the police, and possibly some others were stationed to overhear what petitioner might say. Up to this time he had not confessed to the crime.\n\n\n4\nThe petitioner had been suffering from an acutely painful attack of sinus and Captain Meenahan had promised to get a physician to help him. When petitioner returned to the questioning room after the funeral, Captain Meenahan introduced him to 'Dr. Helfand,' supposedly to give petitioner medical relief. Dr. Helfand, however, was not a general practitioner but a psychiatrist with considerable knowledge of hypnosis. Petitioner was left with Dr. Helfand while Captain Meenahan joined the state District Attorney in the nearby listening room. Instead of giving petitioner the medical advice and treatment he expected, the psychiatrist by subtle and suggestive questions simply continued the police effort of the past days and nights to induce petitioner to admit his guilt. For an hour and a half or more the techniques of a highly trained psychiatrist were used to break petitioner's will in order to get him to say he had murdered his parents. Time and time and time again the psychiatrist told petitioner how much he wanted to and could help him, how bad it would be for petitioner if he did not confess, and how much better he would feel, and how much lighter and easier it would be on him if he would just unbosom himself to the doctor. Yet the doctor was at that very time the paid representative of the state whose prosecuting officials were listening in on every threat made and every promise of leniency given.\n\n\n5\nA tape recording of the psychiatric examination was made and a transcription of the tape was read into the record of this case. To show exactly what transpired we attach rather lengthy excerpts from that transcription as an appendix. The petitioner's answers indicate a mind dazed and bewildered. Time after time the petitioner complains about how tired and how sleepy he is and how he cannot think. On occasion after occasion the doctor told petitioner either to open his eyes or to shut his eyes. Apparently many of petitioner's answers were barely audible. On occasions the doctor informed petitioner that his lips were moving but no sound could be heard. Many times petitioner was asked to speak louder. As time went on, the record indicates that petitioner began to accept suggestions of the psychiatrist. For instance, Dr. Helfand suggested that petitioner had hit his parents with a hammer and after some minutes petitioner agreed that must have been the weapon.\n\n\n6\nFinally, after an hour and a half or longer, petitioner, encouraged by the doctor's assurances that he had done no moral wrong and would be let off easily, called for Captain Meenahan. The captain immediately appeared. It was then that the confession was given to him which was admitted against petitioner in this trial. Immediately following this confession to Captain Meenahan, petitioner's business partner was called from an adjoining room. The police had apparently brought the business partner there to have him talk to petitioner at an opportune moment. Petitioner repeated to his partner in a very brief way some of the things he had told the psychiatrist and the captain. Following this, petitioner was questioned by the two assistant state prosecutors. What purports to be his formal confession was taken down by their stenographer, with a notation that it was given at 10 p.m., several hours after the psychiatrist took petitioner in charge.\n\n\n7\nOn the first appeal the New York Court of Appeals held that the admissions petitioner made to the psychiatrist were so clearly the product of 'mental coercion' that their use as evidence was inconsistent with due process of law. On the second appeal, however, that court held that the subsequent confessions here challenged were properly admitted. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held the same thing. With this holding we cannot agree. Unlike the circumstances in Lyons v. State of Oklahoma, 322 U.S. 596, 602, 603, 64 S.Ct. 1208, 1212, 88 L.Ed. 1481, the undisputed facts in this case are irreconcilable with petitioner's mental freedom 'to confess to or deny a suspected participation in a crime', and the relation of the confessions made to the psychiatrist, the police captain and the state prosecutors, is 'so close that one must sya the facts of one control the character of the other * * *.' All were simply parts of one continuous process. All were extracted in the same place within a period of about five hours as the climax of days and nights of intermittent, intensive police questioning. First, an already physically and emotionally exhausted suspect's ability to resist interrogation was broken to almost trance-like submission by use of the arts of a highly skilled psychiatrist. Then the confession petitioner began making to the psychiatrist was filled in and perfected by additional statements given in rapid succession to a police officer, a trusted friend, and two state prosecutors. We hold that use of confessions extracted in such a manner from a lone defendant unprotected by counsel is not consistent with due process of law as required by our Constitution.\n\n\n8\nIt was error for the court below to affirm the District Court's denial of petitioner's application for habeas corpus.\n\n\n9\nReversed.\n\n\n10\nMr. Justice JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nAppendix to Opinion of the Court.\n\n11\nExcerpts from the transcript of the questioning of petitioner by Dr. Max Helfand, a psychiatrist, at the 88th precinct on January 13, 1950.\n\n\n12\n'Q. What do they call you for short? A. Buddy.'\n\n\n13\n'Q. How old are you about? A. Fifty.'\n\n\n14\n'Q. Are you married? A. Yes, sir.'\n\n\n15\n'Q. Buddy, will you tell me something about yourself. I'll tell you what the purpose of my talk to you is. I want to see if I can help you. A. Yes, Doctor.'\n\n\n16\n'Q. I know you are in a little trouble. We do sometimes things that are not right, but in a fit of temper or anger we sometimes do things that we aren't really responsible for. I want to see whether or not you did something but which you've done in a fit of temper or anger. Do you understand me? A. Yes.'\n\n\n17\n'Q. Will you tell me something about yourself. What kind of a boy are you? Do you have a lot of friends? A. Yes, I have.'\n\n\n18\n'Q. I can't hear you. A. Yes, I have; and I am very tired. I had two hours sleep. Just now they work me up. That's since Tuesday. Well, there were questions, after questions, after questions, by the thousands.'\n\n\n19\n'Q. Aren't you rested now after two hours sleep. You feel pretty good and you look good. A. Well I went to the barber and I feel clean and everything else. The only thing is I am very tired. I didn't feel as tired before I went to bed as I do now. You know\u2014(interruption)\n\n\n20\n'Q. Do you know we sometimes feel tired if we have something on our mind. It's what we call mental tension.'\n\n\n21\n'Q. Do you know we sometimes feel tired if we have something on our mind. It's what we call mental tension. If you talk to me and open up, you're going to feel relieved. Speak up and tell me. Do you have a lot of friends? A. Yes, I have a lot of friends.'\n\n\n22\n'Q. Do you sometimes get into arguments with them? A. No, not as a rule. The first time I was surprised. I always considered myself an even tempered fellow\u2014sociable. It's my sinus. It's bothering me something terrible. It got so in the last year or so. It got worse and worse and worse.'\n\n\n23\n'Q. That made you nervous, didn't it? A. I didn't particularly notice it. For the past two years, my average of work has been about over a hundred hours each week of work for two years. No vacation or anything like that. The first time was anybody noticed it was about\u2014let's see\u2014its about two weeks ago I went to the doctor with my father.'\n\n\n24\n'Q. I see. A. My sinus was bothering me so bad I use to have to stop work during the day.'\n\n\n25\n'Q. What was the matter with your father? A. Dad had a heart attack a couple of years ago, but I went for myself.'\n\n\n26\n'Q. Your father was a nervous man too, wasn't he? A. Yes, but I went for myself. I didn't think I ever was high strung. I thought I was the opposite. I thought I was pretty calm.'\n\n\n27\n'Q. Your father was high strung? A. Yes.'\n\n\n28\n'Q. Fly off the handle quickly? A. Yes. So I went to the doctor and he examined my sinus. He took the blood pressure. So he said to me, 'When did you go to your doctor?' That was\u2014today is Friday\u2014one week back. The Tuesday of that week. It's ten or 11 days.'\n\n\n29\n'Q. You went with your father? A. With my father.'\n\n\n30\n'Q. Did he give you any treatments? A. Yeah, he examined my sinus.'\n\n\n31\n'Q. Did he tell you to come back? A. No, he sent me down to have X-rays taken. When he examined me, he put the lights up here.'\n\n\n32\n'Q. You didn't have any appointment with the doctor after your visit? Did he tell you to come back. A. Oh, yes. He sent me down to have a set of X-rays made. We had the X-rays made. Then I called the doctor and he said it was a very bad case of sinus. It wasn't something new. It was for many years back, and he said there was a lot of scar tissue there, and he asked me could I come right out. That was last Saturday. So Saturday night, I worked. That was my busiest night of the week. So I told him I wouldn't like to come on Saturday, so he said he doesn't have any patients on Sunday, could I come Monday. Monday, unfortunately, I had to work all alone, so I told him I'd make it Tuesday night. So he said, 'You come over Tuesday. I'll be able to do something to stop those pains.' So we made the appointment for Tuesday night at six o'clock.'\n\n\n33\n'Q. For you? A. Yes, and he was going to open those\u2014'\n\n\n34\n'Q. Not for your father? A. No, for myself. My father was with me. He was to go with me on this Tuesday also.'\n\n\n35\n'Q. Why? Did your doctor tell you to bring your father? A. No, he didn't tell me to bring him.'\n\n\n36\n'Q. Why was your father going with you? A. He wanted to go with me. He wanted to see if something couldn't be done to stop those pains. He said, 'Lie down and close my eyes and see if I could stop the beating up there.'\n\n\n37\n'Q. When the pain got so bad, didn't you get nervous?' 'A. Yes, I guess I did. That was the first time anyone ever told me that I was ill. When the doctor took my blood pressure, he said, 'You're very irritable.' And I said, 'I didn't think so.' He told me, he said, 'You're going to have to\u2014you can't work day and night. It's too much.' He said, 'You got to slow down.'\n\n\n38\n'Q. I want you to recollect and tell me everything. I am\u2014'\n\n\n39\n'Q.\u2014(continued)\u2014going to make you remember and recollect back and bring back thoughts\u2014thoughts which you think you might have forgotten. I can make you recollect them. It's entirely to your benefit to recollect them because, you see, you're a nervous boy. You got irritable and you might have got in a fit of temper. Tell me, I am here to help you. A. I wish you could, Doctor.'\n\n\n40\n'Q. I am going to put my hand on your forehead, and as I put my hand on your forehead, you are going to bring back all these thoughts that are coming to your mind. I am going to keep my hand on your forehead and I am going to ask you questions, and now you will be able to tell me. What happened Monday night? Where did you sleep? A. Last Monday night?'\n\n\n41\n'Q. That's right. A. I worked Monday night.'\n\n\n42\n'Q. After you worked, where did you sleep? Where did you go to sleep? A. To the apartment on 10th Street.'\n\n\n43\n'Q. What time did you sleep to, or get up in the morning? A. She got up about 6:30.'\n\n\n44\n'Q. Well, after she left the house, then you couldn't sleep. Then you got dressed? Your thoughts are coming back to you. Answer me. Come on, you can answer me. You couldn't go back to bed. You didn't go back to bed. After she left, you got dressed, didn't you? A. Yes, I got dressed.'\n\n\n45\n'Q. What did you do after you got dressed? Come on, now. Your thoughts are coming back to you. Come on. Come on, answer me. A. I went to Brooklyn.'\n\n\n46\n'Q. You went to Brooklyn. Where did you go to Brooklyn? A. To my mother's house.'\n\n\n47\n'Q. To your mother's house. When you came to your mother\u2014now, all your thoughts are beginning to clear up. Now, everything is clear in your mind. You came to your mother. Who opened the door? A. My mother.'\n\n\n48\n'Q. What did you say? A. I said, 'Hello, Teddy.?\n\n\n49\n'Q. All right. Now, you are in your house. Your thoughts are coming back to you right away. A. Doctor, can I have a drink of water, my mouth is very dry.'\n\n\n50\n'Q. A drink of water? I'll get you a drink of water. A. (Pause).'\n\n\n51\n'Q. All right. O.K. now? A. My mouth is dry. I'm not thirsty. Just my mouth is dry. I'm not thirsty.'\n\n\n52\n'Q. Concentrate and look at me. Now you came home. Your mother met you at the door. You said, 'Hello, Teddy,' right? A. That's right.'\n\n\n53\n'Q. What did she say to you? A. She said take off my coat, it's all wet.'\n\n\n54\n'Q. What did you do? A. I took the coat off.'\n\n\n55\n'Q. Now, you are back in your apartment, see. Your thoughts are clear now. What did you do after you took off your raincoat? A. She told me, 'Come and have some tea.'\n\n\n56\n'Q. She told you what? A. 'Come and have a cup of tea. It will warm you up.\"\n\n\n57\n'Q. What did you do? A. Dad was having breakfast.' 'Q. Where was Dad sitting? A. At the end of the table.'\n\n\n58\n'Q. Where did you sit down? A. Between them.'\n\n\n59\n'Q. Between whom? A. Mom and Pop.'\n\n\n60\n'Q. Between Mom and Pop? A. That's right.'\n\n\n61\n'Q. Where was Mom sitting? A. Next to the kitchen sink.'\n\n\n62\n'Q. You were sitting between Mom and Pop, right? A. That's right.'\n\n\n63\n'Q. What did you do then? A. I sat down.'\n\n\n64\n'Q. Yeah, what did you do? What did you do when you sat down. Come on, speak up. Don't be afraid now. We're with you. We're going to help you. You're going to feel lots better after you talk to me. A. Gee, I hope so.'\n\n\n65\n'Q. I can't hear you. A. The argument started all over again.'\n\n\n66\n'Q. The argument with your father? A.

How long did it take for him to get the paper? A. Oh, just a few minutes.\n\n\n215\n'Q. And in a few minutes, you heard him come in? A. I don't remember him coming in.\n\n\n216\n'Q. What did you do to your mother in the meantime? A. I don't know. If I could only think.\n\n\n217\n'Q. What do you think? Come, think, think. I want to tell you something. You are a smart fellow. I may as well be very frank with you. Everything does not alter the case for you. They are not going to work with you and I am not going to work with you if you don't help yourself. A. I want to help myself.\n\n\n218\n'Q. Now, you see all the details are there. You say yourself, you were the only one there. You say you must have done it? A. We talked this over for twelve hours.\n\n\n219\n'Q. But you didn't remember all the facts that you told me. Now your mind is clear. A. I can't remember how that happened.\n\n\n220\n'Q. The fact that you remember or don't remember don't help you, you know. If you remember and come across like a good man\u2014A. Doc, I want to help myself. I can't remember.\n\n\n221\n'Q. If you tell us the details and come across like a good man, then we can help you. We know that morally you were just in anger. Morally, you are not to be condemned. Right? A. Right.\n\n\n222\n'Q. But you have to tell us the details, then we will know that you are above board and on the level. Otherwise, we just don't do nothing to you and you will get the worst of it. A. I can't remember. I must have done it. I don't deny that I did it.\n\n\n223\n'Q. You don't deny what? A. I don't deny that I did it. I must have done it.\n\n\n224\n'Q. You don't deny that you didn't do it, you mean? A. No, I don't say I didn't do it. I know I did it.\n\n\n225\n'Q. You know you did it? A. Here is the proof of it.\n\n\n226\n'Q. Do you know you did it? A. I can't remember doing it. I know it happened. Look at my mother, the woman that I love most in the world. Look. How did it happen? I can't even remember. I can't remember him. I can't remember him coming back. Doctor, can anybody be this crazy?\n\n\n227\n'Q. That is not crazy, my friend. That is not crazy. When you don't remember anything, that is not crazy. If I forget that I owe somebody ten dollars, that doesn't mean that I am crazy. If you forget the incidents of this thing, that does not mean you are crazy. A. I didn't say it that way.\n\n\n228\n'Q. You said, 'Can anybody be that crazy?' You are not crazy. A. I want to remember this thing. I have got to remember it.\n\n\n229\n'Q. This is what we call amnesia and in other words, a wish to forget because it is not pleasant. It does not mean that you are crazy. A. I didn't say that doctor. You misunderstood me.\n\n\n230\n'Q. I must have misunderstood you. A. I didn't say I was crazy.\n\n\n231\n'Q. You don't think you are crazy, do you? A. No, I hope not.\n\n\n232\n'Q. Do you think you might be crazy? A. No, I don't think so.\n\n\n233\n'Q. Of course not. You are not crazy. You are a nice fellow. I am willing to stay here with you and help you but you have got to help yourself. A. I have tried today for hours to recall from here on, from the time that my mother\u2014I can recall everything. I did it last night. Here, it took hours to piece together things. I sat here. I was so confused that I didn't know whether I owned this suit. I didn't know whether I had a pair of shoes.\n\n\n234\n'Q. Everything is clear up to the point where you held the hammer in your hand? A. That's right but why can't I remember from there on?\n\n\n235\n'Q. If you will just stop for a minute, you will remember. And your thoughts will come into you. A. Doctor, I am exhausted, so please be patient.\n\n\n236\n'Q. I am patient. A. I appreciate that.\n\n\n237\n'Q. I will stay here with you all night, if you want to? A. The Captain and I last night, he was so patient. He waited for hours until these things came home.\n\n\n238\n'Q. For hours? A. I appreciate it.\n\n\n239\n'Q. Do you want me to wait? A. I told him that the last time. It's got to come back. I have been trying to remember all day.\n\n\n240\n'Q. Take your time. Just take your time. A. I am trying to remember.\n\n\n241\n'Q. You got a much better chance to play ball, (Then noice) than if you say you don't remember.\n\n\n242\n'Q. If you tell me that you were in a fit of anger, that you were angry, that you just swung the hammer, but if you tell me that you don't remember, then you will be working against yourself. Where will it get you? A. At that point there, I was so mad. I was like white hot metal. I was so mad. I was never mad at anyone in my life. (Then noise)\n\n\n243\n'Q. Do you feel better? (Then noise) Do you want coffee? A. I drank coffee all night long. (Then noise)\n\n\n244\n'Q. These people are going to throw the book at you unless you can show that in a fit of temper, you got so angry that you did it. Otherwise they toss premeditation in and it's premeditation. See?\n\n\n245\n'Q. Drink your coffee. Take your time. I got time. You got time. Just relax. Want some more coffee? A. I would like some hot coffee, doc. I would like to speak to the Captain.\n\n\n246\n'Q. To whom? A. To Captain Meenahan.\n\n\n247\n'Q. You would like to speak to him? You want me to call him? A. I wish you would.\n\n\n248\n'Q. Do you want me to come back? A. I don't know. He was awful good hunk last night.\n\n\n249\n'Q. Well, we were getting along very nicely. I am trying to straighten him out with his troubles. He seemed a little mixed-up. His mind is clear now. I made him concentrate. His mind is much clearer. You can take my seat, Captain.\n\n\n250\n'Q. Can I speak to the Captain?\n\n\n251\nMr. Justice MINTON, with whom Mr. Justice REED and Mr. Justice BURTON join, dissenting.\n\n\n252\nThis petitioner was charged with murdering his parents by beating the life out of them with a hammer. No one claims that he has a defense to the charge. It is contended, however, that his conviction was not obtained in accordance with due process of law.\n\n\n253\nHe has already had two trials. His first conviction was appealed and reversed. The second one was appealed and affirmed, and this Court denied certiorari on a petition that set up the same constitutional questions now raised. Then habeas corpus proceedings were instituted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and relief was denied. That judgment was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and is the one now here on certiorari.\n\n\n254\nThe New York Court of Appeals reversed the first conviction on the ground that a confession introduced in evidence at the trial was the result of mental coercion and hence involuntary. The threats, cajoling, and promises of leniency, utilized by Dr. Helfand, a psychiatrist called in by the District Attorney, to induce petitioner to confess were soundly condemned by that court. The confession thus obtained was held inadmissible for the purpose of proving petitioner's guilt. But petitioner's subsequent confessions to Captain Meenahan of the police, to the two assistant district attorneys, and to his business associate, Herrschaft, were not invalidated as a matter of law. The case was remanded to the trial court with directions to submit to a jury under proper instructions the question whether the subsequent confessions resulted from or were influenced by the mental coercion which produced the Helfand confession.\n\n\n255\nThe case was tried a second time, and the question of the voluntariness of the subsequent confessions was submitted to the jury under clear and ample instructions as to which petitioner raises no objection here. The jury returned a verdict of guilty of first degree murder of the father, and a sentence of death was imposed.\n\n\n256\nWe are now asked to hold that the later confessions were involuntary as a matter of law and that petitioner was denied due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment because the jury was allowed to consider the voluntariness of the subsequent confessions. It seems to me the very essence of due process to submit to a jury the question of whether these later confessions were tainted by the prior coercion and promises which led to the Helfand confession. I am familiar with no case in which this Court has ever held that an invalid confession ipso facto invalidates all subsequent confessions as a matter of law. It does not seem to me a denial of due process for the state to allow the jury to say, under all the facts and circumstances in evidence and under proper instructions by the court, whether the subsequent confessions were tainted or were free and voluntary. This is precisely what New York did. In Lyons v. State of Oklahoma, 322 U.S. 596, 603, 64 S.Ct. 1208, 1213, 88 L.Ed. 1481, it was said:\n\n\n257\n'The Fourteenth Amendment does not protect one who has      admitted his guilt because of forbidden inducements against      the use at trial of his subsequent confessions under all      possible circumstances. The admissibility of the later      confession depends upon the same test\u2014is it voluntary.'\n\n\n258\nThe only question before us is whether the effects of the coercion practiced by Dr. Helfand so clearly continued to influence petitioner's mind as to make unreasonable any conclusion other than that the later confessions were also coerced. If there was evidence to support contrary inferences as to the continuing effect of the coercive practices, the conviction should not be disturbed. It is not our function to set aside state court convictions on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence. Stein v. People of State of New York, 346 U.S. 156, 180, 73 S.Ct. 1077, 1090.\n\n\n259\nThe evidence shows an involuntary confession to Dr. Helfand.1 It was followed a few minutes later by a confession to Captain Meenahan. Some half hour later petitioner confessed to a business associate, Herrschaft, saying, 'Well, you know what it's all about; I did it.' Herrschaft asked, 'Do you mean that you killed your own mother and father?' and petitioner replied, 'I did it.' This confession was admitted in this Court to have been voluntarily made, and no complaint is made of its admission in evidence. Sandwiched in between the Meenahan confession and the confession to the assistant district attorneys some two and one-half hours later, the Herrschaft confession presents enough evidence in itself to go to the jury on whether these three confessions, one admitted to have been valid, were all given by petitioner voluntarily with the considered purpose of making a clean breast of the whole thing.\n\n\n260\nNor was this the only evidence. Petitioner boldly examined Dr. Helfand, the State's witness, for the purpose, among others, of laying a foundation for the introduction of expert testimony by petitioner's psychiatrist that the effect of the coercion carried over to the later confessions. Petitioner's expert testified as expected. The State then placed on the stand another psychiatrist who gave the opposite opinion, based on evidence that petitioner in his later confessions gave details of the crime known only to him and gave them freely without urging. If this disagreement between experts did not under New York law constitute a conflict in the evidence sufficient standing alone to go to the jury, there was other evidence, such as the Herrschaft confession, to be considered, together with the testimony of the assistant district attorneys that petitioner seemed quite normal and relaxed, and relieved to talk to them. As I said before, it is not our function to weigh the evidence. Whether there was any evidence to go to a jury is the question. In my opinion, there was a question of fact presented by the evidence.\n\n\n261\nThis Court concluded its opinion in the Lyons case in these words:\n\n\n262\n'We cannot say that an inference of guilt based in part upon      Lyons' (later) McAlester confession is so illogical and      unreasonable as to deny the petitioner a fair trial.' Lyons      v. State of Oklahoma, supra, 322 U.S. at page 605, 64 S.Ct.      at page 1214.\n\n\n263\nI cannot say here that the subsequent confessions as a matter of law were so completely under the influence of the first confession that to let a jury pass upon that influence as it affected the voluntariness of the later confessions amounts to a denial of due process of law. To let the jury pass upon this question is not so unfair to petitioner as to violate the fundamental principles of justice.\n\n\n264\nIt is contended that the promises of leniency made by Dr. Helfand stand on a different footing; that once a promise is made, its effect must be presumed to continue until the promise is clearly withdrawn. But such has never been the law. See State v. Willis, 71 Conn. 293, 313, 41 A. 820. As in the case of other forms of coercion and inducement, once a promise of leniency is made a presumption arises that it continues to operate on the mind of the accused. But a showing of a variety of circumstances can overcome that presumption. The length of time elapsing between the promise and the confession, the apparent authority of the person making the promise, whether the confession is made to the same person who offered leniency, and the explicitness and persuasiveness of the inducement are among the many factors to be weighed.\n\n\n265\nThere are two parties to this case, the State and the petitioner, and on the State rests the heavy burden of proving guilt. As Mr. Justice Cardozo said in Snyder v. Com. of Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 122, 54 S.Ct. 330, 338, 78 L.Ed. 674:\n\n\n266\n'But justice, though due to the accused, is due to the      accuser also. The concept of fairness must not be strained      till it is narrowed to a filment. We are to keep the balance      true.'\n\n\n267\nNew York must be mystified in its efforts to enforce its law against homicide to have us say it may not submit a disputed question of fact to a jury. The Court holds that to do so denies due process. The answer to that question, which did not seem substantial to us when certiorari was sought to review the decision of the New York Court of Appeals, now emerges crystal clear when we are reviewing the decision of a federal court dealing with it in a collateral habeas corpus proceeding. And yet the jury and a majority of the judges of every court, state and federal, that until now have considered the matter have found no such failure to observe constitutional standards. Mr. Justice Cardozo's words in the Snyder case, supra, 291 U.S. at page 122, 54 S.Ct. at page 238, seem especially pertinent here:\n\n\n268\n'There is danger that the criminal law will be brought into      contempt\u2014that discredit will even touch the great immunities      assured by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2014if gossamer possibilities      of prejudice to a defendant are to nullify a sentence      pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction in obedience      to local law, and set the guilty free.'\n\n\n269\nThe careful, considerate, fair trial accorded petitioner is in keeping with the fundamental essentials of justice which are due process, and I would affirm.\n\n\n\n1\n The confession was also held to have been in violation of state law and the state's due process clause.\n\n\n2\n The death sentence was imposed under a conviction for first degree murder of the father. As to the death of his mother the jury found petitioner guilty of second degree murder of his mother, which does not carry the death sentence. This second degree conviction is not before us.\n\n\n3\n See, e.g., Brown v. State of Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278, 56 S.Ct. 461, 80 L.Ed. 682; Chambers v. State of Florida, 309 U.S. 227, 60 S.Ct. 472, 84 L.Ed. 716; Lisenba v. People of State of California, 314 U.S. 219, 62 S.Ct. 280, 86 L.Ed. 166; Ashcraft v. State of Tennessee, 322 U.S. 143, 64 S.Ct. 921, 88 L.Ed. 1192; Malinski v. People of State of New York, 324 U.S. 401, 65 S.Ct. 781, 89 L.Ed. 1029; Haley v. State of Ohio, 332 U.S. 596, 68 S.Ct. 302, 92 L.Ed. 224; Watts v. State of Indiana, 338 U.S. 49, 69 S.Ct. 1347, 93 L.Ed. 1801; Stroble v. State of California, 343 U.S. 181, 72 S.Ct. 599, 96 L.Ed. 872; Stein v. People of State of New York, 346 U.S. 156, 73 S.Ct. 1077. The above cases illustrate the settled view of this Court that coerced confessions cannot be admitted as evidence in criminal trials. Some members of the Court reach this conclusion because of their belief that the Fourteenth Amendment makes applicable to the states the Fifth Amendment's ban against compulsory self-incrimination.\n\n\n1\n The record discloses that petitioner was questioned by Captain Meenahan on Tuesday, the day of the murder, from about 9 or 10 in the evening until 10:30 or 10:45 at his parents' apartment. On Wednesday at about 10 in the morning, he was met at his place of business by detectives who questioned him off and on until 1:20 p.m., when Captain Meenahan began an interrogation which was concluded at 11:30 or 12 that night. He was then allowed to go home. It was not until Thursday that he was taken in custody. That morning he was taken out by detectives to check his alibi. Questioning by Captain Meenahan began again about 2 that afternoon. He was kept at the station until 8:30 o'clock Friday morning, but there was little questioning after 10 p.m. Thursday evening. On Friday morning, he was taken to his parents' funeral and then permitted to sleep for an hour and a half. He was returned to the police station, and about 5 o'clock Friday afternoon the interview with Dr. Helfand began. The coercion practiced by Dr. Helfand was forcefully condemned by the New York Court of Appeals and caused it to declare the confession to Dr. Helfand invalid as a matter of law. The validity of this confession is not involved.\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"397 U.S. 72\n90 S.Ct. 774\n25 L.Ed.2d 60\nThe COLONNADE CATERING CORP., Petitioner,v.UNITED STATES.\nNo. 108.\nArgued Jan. 15, 1970.\nDecided Feb. 25, 1970.\n\nO. John Rogge, New York City, for petitioner.\nJerome Feit, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner, a licensee in New York authorized to serve alcoholic beverages and also the holder of a federal retail liquor dealer's occupational stamp tax, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5121(a), brought this suit to obtain the return of seized liquor and to suppress it as evidence. The District Court granted the relief. The Court of Appeals reversed. 410 F.2d 197. The case is here on a petition for writ of certiorari which we granted, 396 U.S. 814, 90 S.Ct. 58, 24 L.Ed.2d 66, to review the decision in light of Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930, and See v. City of Seattle, 387 U.S. 541, 87 S.Ct. 1741, 18 L.Ed.2d 943.\n\n\n2\nPetitioner runs a catering establishment. A federal agent, a member of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division of the Internal Revenue Service, was a guest at a party on petitioner's premises and noted a possible violation of the Federal excise tax law. When federal agents later visited the place, another party was in progress. They noticed that liquor was being served. Without the manager's consent, they inspected the cellar. Then they asked the manager to open the locked liquor storeroom. He said that the only person authorized to open that room was one Rozzo, petitioner's president, who was not on the premises. Later Rozzo arrived and refused to open the storeroom. He asked if the agents had a search warrant and they answered that they did not need one. When Rozzo continued to refuse to unlock the room, an agent broke the lock and entered. Then they removed the bottles of liquor now in controversy which they apparently suspected of being refilled contrary to the command of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301(c).\n\n\n3\nIt is provided in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5146(b)1 and in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 76062 that the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate has broad authority to enter and inspect the premises of retail dealers in liquors.3 And in case of the refusal of a dealer to permit the inspection, it is provided in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7342:\n\n\n4\n'Any owner of any building or place, or person having the      agency or superintendence of the same, who refuses to admit      any officer or employee of the Treasury Department acting      under the authority of section 7606 (relating to entry of      premises for examination of taxable articles) or refuses to      permit him to examine such article or articles, shall, for      every such refusal, forfeit $500.'\n\n\n5\nThe question is whether the imposition of a fine for refusal to permit entry\u2014with the attendant consequences that violation of inspection laws may have in this closely regulated industry\u2014is under this statutory scheme the exclusive sanction, absent a warrant to break and enter.\n\n\n6\nIn Frank v. Maryland, 359 U.S. 360, 366\u2014367, 79 S.Ct. 804, 809, 3 L.Ed.2d 877, a case involving an inspection under a municipal code, we said:\n\n\n7\n'(The) inspector has no power to force entry and did not      attempt it. A fine is imposed for resistance, but officials      are not authorized to break past the unwilling occupant.'\n\n\n8\nFrank v. Maryland was overruled in Camara v. Municipal Court, supra, insofar as it permitted warrantless searches or inspections under municipal fire, health, and housing codes. The dictum that the provision for a fine on refusal to allow inspection made the use of force improper when there was no warrant was not disturbed; and the question is whether that dictum contains the controlling principle4 for this case.\n\n\n9\nThe Government, emphasizing that the Fourth Amendment bans only 'unreasonable searches and seizures,'5 relies heavily on the long history of the regulation of the liquor industry during pre-Fourth Amendment days, first in England and later in the American Colonies. It is pointed out, for example, that in 1660 the precursor of modern-day liquor legislation was enacted in England6 which allowed commissioners to enter, on demand, brewing houses at all times for inspection. Massachusetts had a similar law in 1692.7 And in 1791, the year in which the Fourth Amendment was ratified, Congress imposed an excise tax on imported distilled spirits and on liquor distilled here,8 under which law federal officers had broad powers to inspect distilling premises and the premises of the importer9 without a warrant. From these and later laws and regulations governing the liquor industry, it is argued that Congress has been most solicitous in protecting the revenue against various types of fraud and to that end has repeatedly granted federal agents power to make warrantless searches and seizures of articles under the liquor laws.\n\n\n10\nThe Court recognized the special treatment of inspection laws of this kind in Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 624, 6 S.Ct. 524, 529, 29 L.Ed. 746:\n\n\n11\n'(In) the case of excisable or dutiable articles, the      government has an interest in them for the payment of the      duties thereon, and until such duties are paid has a right to      keep them under observation, or to pursue and drag them from      concealment.'\n\nAnd it added:\n\n12\n'The seizure of stolen goods is authorized by the common law;      and the seizure of goods forfeited for a breach of the      revenue laws, or concealed to avoid the duties payable on      them, has been authorized by English statutes for at least      two centuries past; and the like seizures have been      authorized by our own revenue acts from the commencement of      the government. The first statute passed by congress to      regulate the collection of duties, the act of July 31, 1789,      1 Stat. 29, 43, contains provisions to this effect. As this      act was passed by the same congress which proposed for      adoption the original amendments to the constitution, it is      clear that the members of that body did not regard searches      and seizures of this kind as 'unreasonable,' and they are not      embraced within the prohibition of the amendment.' Id., at      623, 6 S.Ct. at 528.\n\n\n13\nWe agree that Congress has broad power to design such powers of inspection under the liquor laws as it deems necessary to meet the evils at hand. The general rule laid down in See v. City of Seattle, supra, 387 U.S. at 545, 87 S.Ct. at 1740\u2014'that administrative entry, without consent, upon the portions of commercial premises which are not open to the public may only becompelled through prosecution or physical force within the framework of a warrant procedure'\u2014is therefore not applicable here. In See, we reserved decision on the problems of 'licensing programs' requiring inspection, saying they can be resolved 'on a case-by-case basis under the general Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness.' Id., at 546, 87 S.Ct., at 1741.\n\n\n14\nWhere Congress has authorized inspection but made no rules governing the procedure that inspectors must follow, the Fourth Amendment and its various restrictive rules apply. We said in the See case:\n\n\n15\n'The businessman, like the occupant of a residence, has a      constitutional right to go about his business free from      unreasonable official entries upon his private commercial      property. The businessman, too, has that right placed in      jeopardy if the decision to enter and inspect for violation      of regulatory laws can be made and enforced by the inspector      in the field without official authority evidenced by      warrant.' Id., at 543, 87 S.Ct. at 1739.\n\n\n16\nWhat was said in See reflects this Nation's traditions that are strongly opposed to using force without definite authority to break down doors. We deal here with the liquor industry long subject to close supervision and inspection. As respects that industry, and its various branches including retailers, Congress has broad authority to fashion standards of reasonableness for searches and seizures. Under the existing statutes, Congress selected a standard that does not include forcible entries without a warrant. It resolved the issue, not by authorizing forcible, warrantless entries, but by making it an offense for a licensee to refuse admission to the inspector.\n\n\n17\nReversed.\n\n\n18\nMr. Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice STEWART join, dissenting.\n\n\n19\nI join in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice BLACK; however, since my position goes somewhat beyond his discussion I add my views separately.\n\n\n20\nI assume we could all agree that the search in question must be held valid, and the contraband discovered subject to seizure and forfeiture, unless (a) it is 'unreasonable' under the Constitution or (b) it is prohibited by a statute imposing restraints apart from those in the Constitution. The majority sees no constitutional violation; I agree.\n\n\n21\nThe controlling statutes set out in notes 1 and 2 of the majority opinion affirmatively define the conditions and times when agents may enter premises and inspect. Under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5146(b) agents may enter to inspect 'any distilled spirits, wines, or beer kept or stored by such dealer on such premises.' The time when this may be done is fixed as 'during business hours.' Section 7606 of 26 U.S.C., set forth in note 2 of the majority opinion, provides that agents may enter any building where taxable articles are kept, 'so far as it may be necessary for the purpose of examining said articles or objects.'\n\n\n22\nThe government agents needed neither a warrant nor these statutes to secure entry to this place of business since it was as open as any business establishment that seeks to sell goods and services to the public. The agents need to rely on the statutes only to carry out their duty to inspect after accomplishing entry. This was recognized implicitly by Congress in limiting the inspection to 'business hours' and daytime. Congress went beyond mere entry; it provided for inspection. Inspection authorization would be meaningless if the agents could not open lockers, cabinets, closets, and storerooms and indeed pry open cases of liquor to see the contents.\n\n\n23\nSurely Congress was not unaware that purveyors of liquor do not leave their wares or stores or reserve supplies lying casually about; on the contrary they keep supplies under lock in various ways, including lockers, cabinets, closets, or storerooms; this practice is so universal it can be judicially noticed.\n\n\n24\nHere the agents acted explicitly under statutes containing the language 'so far as it may be necessary'; this is simple and clear and for me it is plainly broad enough to permit inspection of all spirits 'kept or stored * * * on such premises' whether in lockers, cabinets, closets, or storerooms. Congress having prescribed this as a reasonable means of enforcing the inspection necessary to tax collection, I see no basis for any court to say it cannot be done.\n\n\n25\nThat Congress provided an added penalty for those who refuse access for inspection is irrelevant. We can assume this was to encourage licensed purveyors to comply promptly to facilitate inspections. The majority views the $500 fine as the Government's exclusive remedy for the non-cooperation of the taxpayer. Congress could hardly be so naive as to give to the licensee the option to choose between the risk of a $500 fine against the certain discovery, if he is in violation, of a large store of liquor subject to forfeiture. At current prices $500 would represent four or five cases of spirits. The alternative of securing a warrant touches on the constitutional issues which the majority does not rely on. We should note, of course, that the majority holding eliminates any basis for a forfeiture of the contraband liquor and leaves the Government to another lawsuit to collect a $500 fine.\n\n\n26\nWith deference I submit the majority has needlessly complicated a relatively simple issue of statutory construction with undertones of constitutionally limited searches. The words 'so far as it may be necessary' are quite plain and we all agree no issue of constitutional dimensions is presented.\n\n\n27\nMr. Justice BLACK, with whom the CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice STEWART join, dissenting.\n\n\n28\nPetitioner brought proceedings under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for the return of liquor seized by federal agents. One of those rules provides that '(a) person aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure may move the district court * * * for the return of the property * * * so obtained on the ground that (1) the property was illegally seized without warrant * * *.' Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 41(e). (Emphasis added.) As I read that provision, it requires petitioner to show that the seizure in this case was illegal, either because it violated the Fourth Amendment, or because it was in violation of some law passed by Congress. In my opinion neither requirement has been met and therefore petitioner is not entitled to a return of the seized liquor.\n\n\n29\nThere can be no doubt that places that sell liquor to the public have historically been subjected to strict governmental scrutiny for many centuries both in this country and in England. The Court sets out a little of the history of that regulation in its opinion. I therefore agree that there is nothing unreasonable, as that term is used in the Fourth Amendment, in permitting officers to go into an establishment that provides alcoholic beverages to the public, and upon finding something that indicates a flagrant violation of the law to pursue their examination to see whether a violation is actually occurring. The officers did just that in this case, and I see no reason on earth why any man should hold that conduct unreasonable. This Court certainly should not prevent faithful officers, when they see the law being violated practically before their very eyes, from taking the steps necessary to stop and prove that violation.\n\n\n30\nThe majority, far from finding this search unreasonable and therefore illegal under the Fourth Amendment, holds only that it was not authorized by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5146(b), 7606(a),1 and that therefore the liquor must be returned. While these statutes do not in express terms authorize forcible breaking and entering to seize liquor kept inviolation of federal law, it is perfectly clear that they do not in express terms declare such seizure illegal, and in my opinion those provisions impliedly authorize exactly the type of official conduct involved here. I am confident that when Congress said that federal liquor agents could search without a warrant and further provided for fines if the owner refused to permit such a search,2 it also intended to authorize forcible entry and seizure if that became necessary. I do not think Congress needed to speak any more clearly than it already has. Since I cannot conclude that this search and seizure was illegal under either the Fourth Amendment or any Act of Congress, but was to the contrary carried out pursuant to congressional authorization, I would affirm the judgment below and hold that petitioner was not entitled to a return of the liquor.\n\n\n\n1\n 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5146(b) provides:\n'The Secretary or his delegate may enter during business hours the premises (including places of storage) of any dealer for the purpose of inspecting or examining any records or other documents required to be kept by such dealer under this chapter or regulations issued pursuant thereto and any distilled spirits, wines, or beer kept or stored by such dealer on such premises.'\n\n\n2\n 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7606 provides:\n'(a) Entry during day.\n'The Secretary or his delegate may enter, in the daytime, any building or place where any articles or objects subject to tax are made, produced, or kept, so far as it may be necessary for the purpose of examining said articles or objects.\n'(b) Entry at night.\n'When such premises are open at night, the Secretary or his delegate may enter them while so open, in the performance of his official duties.'\n\n\n3\n As defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5122(a).\n\n\n4\n And see United States v. Frisch, 140 F.2d 660, 662.\n\n\n5\n The Fourth Amendment reads as follows:\n'The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.'\n\n\n6\n 12 Car. 2, c. 23, \u00a7 19.\n\n\n7\n Act of June 24, 1692, Mass.

Krause, San Francisco, Cal., for appellant.\nAlbert W. Harris, Jr., San Francisco, Cal., for appellee.\nMr. Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nIn Frank v. State of Maryland, 359 U.S. 360, 79 S.Ct. 804, 3 L.Ed.2d 877, this Court upheld, by a five-to-four vote, a state court conviction of a homeowner who refused to permit a municipal health inspector to enter and inspect his premises without a search warrant. In Ohio ex rel. Eaton v. Price, 364 U.S. 263, 80 S.Ct. 1463, 4 L.Ed.2d 1708, a similar conviction was affirmed by an equally divided Court. Since those closely divided decisions, more intensive efforts at all levels of government to contain and eliminate urban blight have led to increasing use of such inspection techniques, while numerous decisions of this Court have more fully defined the Fourth Amendment's effect on state and municipal action. E.g., Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081; Ker v. State of California, 374 U.S. 23, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 10 L.Ed.2d 726. In view of the growing nationwide importance of the problem, we noted probable jurisdiction in this case and in See v. City of Seattle, 387 U.S. 541, 87 S.Ct. 1737, 18 L.Ed.2d 943, to re-examine whether administrative inspection programs, as presently authorized and conducted, violate Fourth Amendment rights as those rights are enforced against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. 385 U.S. 808, 87 S.Ct. 31, 17 L.Ed.2d 50.\n\n\n2\nAppellant brought this action in a California Superior Court alleging that he was awaiting trial on a criminal charge of violating the San Francisco Housing Code by refusing to permit a warrantless inspection of his residence, and that a writ of prohibition should issue to the criminal court because the ordinance authorizing such inspections is unconstitutional on its face. The Superior Court denied the writ, the District Court of Appeal affirmed, and he  Supreme Court of California denied a petition for hearing. Appellant properly raised and had considered by the California courts the federal constitutional questions he now presents to this Court.\n\n\n3\nThough there were no judicial findings of fact in this prohibition proceeding, we shall set forth the parties' factual allegations. On November 6, 1963, an inspector of the Division of Housing Inspection of the San Francisco Department of Public Health entered an apartment building to make a routine annual inspection for possible violations of the city's Housing Code.1 The building's manager informed the inspector that appellant, lessee of the ground floor, was using the rear of his leasehold as a personal residence. Claiming that the building's occupancy permit did not allow residential use of the ground floor, the inspector confronted appellant and demanded that he permit an inspection of the premises. Appellant refused to allow the inspection because the inspector lacked a search warrant.\n\n\n4\nThe inspector returned on November 8, again without a warrant, and appellant again refused to allow an inspection. A citation was then mailed ordering appellant to appear at the district attorney's office. When appellant failed to appear, two inspectors returned to his apartment on November 22. They informed appellant that he was required by law to permit an inspection under \u00a7 503 of the Housing Code:\n\n\n5\n'Sec. 503 RIGHT TO ENTER BUILDING. Authorized employees of      the City departments or City agencies, so far as may be      necessary for the performance of their duties, shall, upon      presentation of proper credentials, have the right to enter,      at reasonable times, any building, structure, or premises in      the City to perform any duty imposed upon them by the      Municipal Code.' Appellant nevertheless refused the inspectors access to his apartment without a search warrant. Thereafter, a complaint was filed charging him with refusing to permit a lawful inspection in violation of \u00a7 507 of the Code.2 Appellant was arrested on December 2 and released on bail. When his demurrer to the criminal complaint was denied, appellant filed this petition for a writ of prohibition.\n\n\n6\nAppellant has argued throughout this litigation that \u00a7 503 is contrary to the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments in that it authorizes municipal officials to enter a private dwelling without a search warrant and without probable cause to believe that a violation of the Housing Code exists therein. Consequently, appellant contends, he may not be prosecuted under \u00a7 507 for refusing to permit an inspection unconstitutionally authorized by \u00a7 503. Relying on Frank v. State of Maryland, Eaton v. Price, and decisions in other States,3 the District Court of Appeal held that \u00a7 503 does not violate Fourth Amendment rights because it 'is part of a regulatory scheme which is essentially civil rather than criminal in nature, inasmuch as that section creates a right of inspection which is limited in scope and may not be exercised under unreasonable conditions.' Having concluded that Frank v. State of Maryland, to the extent that it sanctioned such warrantless inspections, must be overruled, we reverse.\n\nI.\n\n7\nThe Fourth Amendment provides that, 'The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.' The basic purpose of this Amendment, as recognized in countless decisions of this Court, is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials. The Fourth Amendment thus gives concrete expression to a right of the people which 'is basic to a free society.' Wolf v. People of State of Colorado, 338 U.S. 25, 27, 69 S.Ct. 1359, 1361, 93 L.Ed. 1782. As such, the Fourth Amendment is enforceable against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. Ker v. State of California, 374 U.S. 23, 30, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 1628, 10 L.Ed.2d 726.\n\n\n8\nThough there has been general agreement as to the fundamental purpose of the Fourth Amendment, translation of the abstract prohibition against 'unreasonable searches and seizures' into workable guidelines for the decision of particular cases is a difficult task which has for many years divided the members of this Court. Nevertheless, one governing principle, justified by history and by current experience, has consistently been followed: except in certain carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without proper consent is 'unreasonable' unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant. See, e.g., Stoner v. State of California, 376 U.S. 483, 84 S.Ct. 889, 11 L.Ed.2d 856; United States v. Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48, 72 S.Ct. 93, 96 L.Ed. 59; McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 69 S.Ct. 191, 93 L.Ed. 153; Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20, 46 S.Ct. 4, 70 L.Ed. 145. As the Court explained in Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 14, 68 S.Ct. 367, 369, 92 L.Ed. 436:\n\n\n9\n'The right of officers to thrust themselves into a home is      also a grave concern, not only to the individual but to a      society which chooses to dwell in reasonable security and      freedom from surveillance. When the right of privacy must      reasonably yield to the right of search is, as a rule, to be      decided by a judicial officer, not by a policeman or      government enforcement agent.'\n\n\n10\nIn Frank v. State of Maryland, this Court upheld the conviction of one who refused to permit a warrantless inspection of private premises for the purposes of locating and abating a suspected public nuisance. Although Frank can arguably be distinguished from this case on its facts,4 the Frank opinion has generally been interpreted as carving out an additional exception to the rule that warrantless searches are unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. See Eaton v. Price, supra. The District Court of Appeal so interpreted Frank in this case, and that ruling is the core of appellant's challenge here. We proceed to a re-examination of the factors which er suaded the frank majority to adopt this construction of the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches.\n\n\n11\nTo the Frank majority, municipal fire, health, and housing inspection programs 'touch at most upon the periphery of the important interests safeguarded by the Fourteenth Amendment's protection against official intrusion,' 359 U.S., at 367, 79 S.Ct., at 809, because the inspections are merely to determine whether physical conditions exist which do not comply with minimum standards prescribed in local regulartory ordinances. Since the inspector does not ask that the property owner open his doors to a search for 'evidence of criminal action' which may be used to secure the owner's criminal conviction, historic interests of 'self-protection' jointly protected by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments5 are said not to be involved, but only the less intense 'right to be secure from intrusion into personal privacy.' Id., at 365, 79 S.Ct. at 808.\n\n\n12\nWe may agree that a routine inspection of the physical condition of private property is a less hostile intrusion than the typical policeman's search for the fruits and instrumentalities of crime. For this reason alone, Frank differed from the great bulk of Fourth Amendment cases which have been considered by this Court. But we cannot agree that the Fourth Amendment interests at stake in these inspection cases are merely 'peripheral.' It is surely anomalous to say that the individual and his private property are fully protected by the Fourth Amendment only when the individual is suspected of criminal behavior.6 For instance, even the most law-abiding citizen has a very tangible interest in limiting the circumstances under which the sanctity of his home may be broken by official authority, for the possibility of criminal entry under the guise of official sanction is a serious threat to personal and family security. And even accepting Frank's rather remarkable premise, inspections of the kind we are here considering do in fact jeopardize 'self-protection' interests of the property owner. Like most regulatory laws, fire, health, and housing codes are enforced by criminal processes. In some cities, discovery of a violation by the inspector leads to a criminal complaint.7 Even in cities where discovery of a violation produces only an administrative compliance order,8 refusal to comply is a criminal offense, and the fact of compliance is verified by a second inspection, again without a warrant.9 Finally, as this case demonstrates, refusal to permit an inspection is itself a crime, punishable by fine or even by jail sentence.\n\n\n13\nThe Frank majority suggested, and appellee reasserts, two other justificaton \u00a7 for permitting administrative health and safety inspections without a warrant. First, it is argued that these inspections are 'designed to make the least possible demand on the individual occupant.' 359 U.S., at 367, 79 S.Ct., at 809. The ordinances authorizing inspections are hedged with safeguards, and at any rate the inspector's particular decision to enter must comply with the constitutional standard of reasonableness even if he may enter without a warrant.10 In addition, the argument proceeds, the warrant process could not function effectively in this field. The decision to inspect an entire municipal area is based upon legislative or administrative assessment of broad factors such as the area's age and condition. Unless the magistrate is to review such policy matters, he must issue a 'rubber stamp' warrant which provides no protection at all to the property owner.\n\n\n14\nIn our opinion, these arguments unduly discount the purposes behind the warrant machinery contemplated by the Fourth Amendment. Under the present system, when the inspector demands entry, the occupant has no way of knowing whether enforcement of the municipal code involved requires inspection of his premises, no way of knowing the lawful limits of the inspector's power to search, and no way of knowing whether the inspector himself is acting under proper authorization. These are questions which may be reviewed by a neutral magistrate without any reassessment of the basic agency decision to canvass an area. Yet, only by refusing entry and risking a criminal conviction can the occupant at present challenge the inspector's decision to search. And even if the occupant possesses sufficient fortitude to take this risk, as appellant did here, he may never learn any more about the reason for the inspection than that the law generally allows housing inspectors to gain entry. The practical effect of this system is to leave the occupant subject to the discretion of the official in the field. This is precisely the discretion to invade private property which we have consistently circumscribed by a requirement that a disinterested party warrant the need to search. See cases cited, p. 529, supra. We simply cannot say that the protections provided by the warrant procedure are not needed in this context; broad statutory safeguards are no substitute for individualized review, particularly when those safeguards may only be invoked at the risk of a criminal penalty.\n\n\n15\nThe final justification suggested for warrantless administrative searches is that the public interest demands such a rule: it is vigorously argued that the health and safety of entire urban populations is dependent upon enforcement of minimum fire, housing, and sanitation standards, and that the only effective means of enforcing such codes is by routine systematized inspection of all physical structures. Of course, in applying any reasonableness standard, including one of constitutional dimension, an argument that the public interest demands a particular rule must receive careful consideration. But we think this argument misses the mark. The question is not, at this stage at least, whether these inspections may be made, but whether they may be made without a warrant. For example, to say that gambling raids may not be made at the discretion of the police without a warrant is not necessarily to say that gambling raids may never be made. In assessing whether the public interest demands creaton  of a general exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, the question is not whether the public interest justifies the type of search in question, but whether the authority to search should be evidenced by a warrant, which in turn depends in part upon whether the burden of obtaining a warrant is likely to frustrate the governmental purpose behind the search. See Schmerber v. State of California, 384 U.S. 757, 770\u2014771, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 1835\u20141836, 16 L.Ed.2d 908. It has nowhere been urged that fire, health, and housing code inspection programs could not achieve their goals within the confines of a reasonable search warrant requirement. Thus, we do not find the public need argument dispositive.\n\n\n16\nIn summary, we hold that administrative searches of the kind at issue here are significant intrusions upon the interests protected by the Fourth Amendment, that such searches when authorized and conducted without a warrant procedure lack the traditional safeguards which the Fourth Amendment guarantees to the individual, and that the reasons put forth in Frank v. State of Maryland and in other cases for upholding these warrantless searches are insufficient to justify so substantial a weakening of the Fourth Amendment's protections. Because of the nature of the municipal programs under consideration, however, these conclusions must be the beginning, not the end, of our inquiry. The Frank majority gave recognition to the unique character of these inspection programs by refusing to require search warrants; to reject that disposition does not justify ignoring the question whether some other accommodation between public need and individual rights is essential.\n\nII.\n\n17\nThe Fourth Amendment provides that, 'no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.' Borrowing from more typical Fourth Amendment cases, appellant argues not only that code enforcement inspection programs must be circumscribed by a warrant procedure, but also that warrants should issue only when the inspector possesses probable cause to believe that a particular dwelling contains violations of the minimum standards prescribed by the code being enforced. We disagree.\n\n\n18\nIn cases in which the Fourth Amendment requires that a warrant to search be obtained, 'probable cause' is the standard by which a particular decision to search is tested against the constitutional mandate of reasonableness. To apply this standard, it is obviously necessary first to focus upon the governmental interest which allegedly justifies official intrusion upon the constitutionally protected interests of the private citizen. For example, in a criminal investigation, the police may undertake to recover specific stolen or contraband goods. But that public interest would hardly justify a sweeping search of an entire city conducted in the hope that these goods might be found. Consequently, a search for these goods, even with a warrant, is 'reasonable' only when there is 'probable cause' to believe that they will be uncovered in a particular dwelling.\n\n\n19\nUnlike the search pursuant to a criminal investigation, the inspection programs at issue here are aimed at securing city-wide compliance with minimum physical standards for private property. The primary governmental interest at stake is to prevent even the unintentional development of conditions which are hazardous to public health and safety. Because fires and epidemics may ravage large urban areas, because unsightly conditions adversely affect the economic values of neighboring structures, numerous courts have upheld the police power of municipalities to impose and enforce such minimum standards even upon existing structures.11 In determining whether a particular inspection is reasonable\u2014and thus in determining whether there is probable cause to issue a warrant for that inspection\u2014the need for the inspection must be weighed in terms of these reasonable goals of code enforcement.\n\n\n20\nThere is unanimous agreement among those most familiar with this field that the only effective way to seek universal compliance with the minimum standards required by municipal codes is through routine periodic inspections of all structures.12 It is here that the probable cause debate is focused, for the agency's decision to conduct an area inspection is unavoidably based on its appraisal of conditions in the area as a whole, not on its knowledge of conditions in each particular building. Appellee contends that, if the probable cause standard urged by appellant is adopted, the area inspection will be eliminated as a means of seeking compliance with code standards and the reasonable goals of code enforcement will be dealt a crushing blow.\n\n\n21\nIn meeting this contention, appellant argues first, that his probable cause standard would not jeopardize area inspection programs because only a minute portion of the population will refuse to consent to such inspections, and second, that individual privacy in any event should be given preference to the public interest in conducting such inspections. The first argument, even if true, is irrelevant to the question whether the area inspection is reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The second argument is in effect an assertion that the area inspection is an unreasonable search. Unfortunately, there can be no ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search against the invasion which the search entails. But we think that a number of persuasive factors combine to support the reasonableness of area code-enforcement inspections. First, such programs have a long history of judicial and public acceptance. See Frank v. State of Maryland, 359 U.S., at 367\u2014371, 79 S.Ct. at 809\u2014811. Second, the public interest demands that all dangerous conditions be prevented or abated, yet it is doubtful that any other canvassing technique would achieve acceptable results. Many such conditions\u2014faulty wiring is an obvious example\u2014are not observable from outside the building and indeed may not be apparent to the inexpert occupant himself. Finally, because the inspections are neither personal in nature nor aimed at the discovery of evidence of crime, they involve a relatively limited invasion of the urban citizen's privacy. Both the majority and the dissent in Frank emphatically supported this conclusion:\n\n\n22\n'Time and experience have forcefully taught that the power to      inspect dwelling places, either as a matter of systematic      area-by-area search or, as here, to treat a specific problem,      is of indispensable importance to the maintenance of      community health; a power that would be greatly hobbled by      the blanket requirement of the safeguards necessary for a      search of evidence of criminal acts. Th n eed for preventive      action is great, and city after city has seen this need and      granted the power of inspection to its health officials; and      these inspections are apparently welcomed by all but an      insignificant few. Certainly, the nature of our society has      not vitiated the need for inspections first thought necessary      158 years ago, nor has experience revealed any abuse or      inroad on freedom in meeting this need by means that history      and dominant public opinion have sanctioned.' 359 U.S., at      372, 79 S.Ct. at 811.\n\n\n23\n'* * * This is not to suggest that a health official           need show the same kind of proof to a magistrate to           obtain a warrant as one must who would search for the           fruits or instrumentalities of crime. Where           considerations of health and safety are involved, the           facts that would justify an inference of 'probable           cause' to make an inspection are clearly different from           those that would justify such an inference where a           criminal investigation has been undertaken. Experience           may show the need for periodic inspections of certain           facilities without a further showing of cause to believe           that substandard conditions dangerous to the public are           being maintained. The passage of a certain period           without inspection might of itself be sufficient in a           given situation to justify the issuance of warrant. The           test of 'probable cause' required by the Fourth           Amendment can take into account the nature of the search           that is being sought.' 359 U.S., at 383, 79 S.Ct. at 87           (Mr. Justice Douglas, dissenting).\n\n\n24\nHaving concluded that the area inspection is a 'reasonable' search of private property within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, it is obvious that 'probable cause' to issue a warrant to inspect must exist if reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an area inspection are satisfied with respect to a particular dwelling. Such standards, which will vary with the municipal program being enforced, may be based upon the passage of time, the nature of the building (e.g., a multifamily apartment house), or the condition of the entire area, but they will not necessarily depend upon specific knowledge of the condition of the particular dwelling. It has been suggested that so to vary the probable cause test from the standard applied in criminal cases would be to authorize a 'synthetic search warrant' and thereby to lessen the overall protections of the Fourth Amendment. Frank v. State of Maryland, 359 U.S., at 373, 79 S.Ct. at 812. But we do not agree. The warrant procedure is designed to guarantee that a decision to search private property is justified by a reasonable governmental interest. But reasonableness is still the ultimate standard. If a valid public interest justifies the intrusion contemplated, then there is probable cause to issue a suitably restricted search warrant. Cf. Oklahoma Press Pub. Co. v. Walling, 327 U.S. 186, 66 S.Ct. 494, 90 L.Ed. 614. Such an approach neither endangers time-honored doctrines applicable to criminal investigations nor makes a nullity of the probable cause requirement in this area. It merely gives full recognition to the competing public and private interests here at stake and, in so doing, best fulfills the historic purpose behind the constitutional right to be free from unreasonable government invasions of privacy. See Eaton v. Price, 364 U.S., at 273\u2014274, 80 S.Ct., at 1468\u20141469 (opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan).\n\nIII.\n\n25\nSince our holding emphasizes the controlling standard of reasonableness, nothing we say today is intended to foreclose prompt inspections, even without a warrant, that the law has traditionally upheld in emergency situations. See North American Cold Storage Co. v. City of Chicago, 211 U.S. 306, 29 S.Ct. 101, 53 L.Ed. 195 (seizure of unwholesome food); Jacobson v.

Louisiana State Board of Health, 186 U.S. 380, 22 S.Ct. 811, 46 L.Ed. 129  (health quarantine); Kroplin v. Truax, 119 Ohio St. 610, 165 N.E. 498 (summary destruction of tubercular cattle). On the other hand, in the case of most routine area inspections, there is no compelling urgency to inspect at a particular time or on a particular day. Moreover, most citizens allow inspections of their property without a warrant. Thus, as a practical matter and in light of the Fourth Amendment's requirement that a warrant specify the property to be searched, it seems likely that warrants should normally be sought only after entry is refused unless there has been a citizen complaint or there is other satisfactory reason for securing immediate entry. Similarly, the requirement of a warrant procedure does not suggest any change in what seems to be the prevailing local policy, in most situations, of authorizing entry, but not entry by force, to inspect.\n\nIV.\n\n26\nIn this case, appellants has been charged with a crime for his refusal to permit housing inspectors to enter his leasehold without a warrant. There was no emergency demanding immediate access; in fact, the inspectors made three trips to the building in an attempt to obtain appellant's consent to search. Yet no warrant was obtained and thus appellant was unable to verify either the need for or the appropriate limits of the inspection. No doubt, the inspectors entered the public portion of the building with the consent of the landlord, through the building's manager, but appellee does not contend that such consent was sufficient to authorize inspection of appellant's premises. Cf. Stoner v. State of California, 376 U.S. 483, 84 S.Ct. 889, 11 L.Ed.2d 856; Chapman v. United States, 365 U.S. 610, 81 S.Ct. 776, 5 L.Ed.2d 828; McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 69 S.Ct. 191, 93 L.Ed. 153. Assuming the facts to be as the parties have alleged, we therefore conclude that appellant had a constitutional right to insist that the inspectors obtain a warrant to search and that appellant may not constitutionally be convicted for refusing to consent to the inspection. It appears from the opinion of the District Court of Appeal that under these circumstances a writ of prohibition will issue to the criminal court under California law.\n\n\n27\nThe judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n\n\n28\nJudgment vacated and case remanded.\n\n\n\n1\n The inspection was conducted pursuant to \u00a7 86(3) of the San Francisco Municipal Code, which provides that apartment house operators shall pay an annual license fee in part to defray the cost of periodic inspections of their buildings. The inspections are to be made by the Bureau of Housing Inspection 'at least once a year and as often thereafter as may be deemed necessary.' The permit of occupancy, which prescribes the apartment units which a building may contain, is not issued until the license is obtained.\n\n\n2\n 'Sec. 507 PENALTY FOR VIOLATION. Any person, the owner or his authorized agent who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with, or who resists or opposes the execution of any of the provisions of this Code, or any order of the Superintendent, the Director of Public Works, or the Director of Public Health made pursuant to this Code, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00), or by imprisonment, not exceeding six (6) months or by both such fine and imprisonment, unless otherwise provided in this Code, and shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for every day such violation, disobedience, omission, neglect or refusal shall continue.'\n\n\n3\n Givner v.

Boudin, New York City, for appellee.\nMr. Justice GOLDBERG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nWe are called upon in these two cases to decide the grave and fundamental problem, common to both, of the constitutionality of Acts of Congress which divest an American of his citizenship for '(d)eparting from or remaining outside of the jurisdiction of the United States in time of war or * * * national emergency for the purpose of evading or avoiding training and service' in the Nation's armed forces.1\n\nI. THE FACTS.\n\n2\nA. Mendoza-Martinez\u2014No. 2.\n\n\n3\nThe facts of both cases are not in dispute. Mendoza-Martinez, the appellee in No. 2, was born in this country in 1922 and therefore acquired American citizenship by birth. By reason of his parentage, he also, under Mexican law, gained Mexican citizenship, thereby possessing dual nationality. In 1942 he departed from this country and went to Mexico solely, as he admits, for the purpose of evading military service in our armed forces. He concedes that he remained there for that sole purpose until November 1946, when he voluntarily returned to this country. In 1947, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, he pleaded guilty to and was convicted of evasion of his service obligations in violation of \u00a7 11 of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940.2 He served the imposed sentence of a year and a day. For all that appears in the record, he was, upon his release, allowed to reside undisturbed in this country until 1953, when, after a lapse of five years, he was served with a warrant of arrest in deportation proceedings. This was premised on the assertion that, by remaining outside the United States to avoid military service after September 27, 1944, when \u00a7 401(j) took effect, he had lost his American citizenship. Following hearing, the Attorney General's special inquiry officer sustained the warrant and ordered that Mendoza-Martinez be deported as an alien. He appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals of the Department of Justice, which dismissed his appeal.\n\n\n4\nThereafter, Mendoza-Martinez brought a declaratory judgment action in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of California, seeking a declaration of his status as a citizen, of the unconstitutionality of \u00a7 401(j), and of the voidness of all orders of deportation directed against him. A single-judge District Court in an unreported decision entered judgment against Mendoza-Martinez in 1955, holding that by virtue of \u00a7 401(j), which the court held to be constitutional, he had lost his nationality by remaining outside the jurisdiction of the United States after September 27, 1944. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment, 238 F.2d 239. This Court, in 1958, Mendoza-Martinez v. Mackey, 356 U.S. 258, 78 S.Ct. 713, 2 L.Ed.2d 757, granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the cause to the District Court for reconsideration in light of its decision a week earlier in Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 596.\n\n\n5\nOn September 24, 1958, the District Court announced its new decision, also unreported, that in light of Trop \u00a7 401(j) is unconstitutional because not based on any 'rational nexus * * * between the content of a specific power in Congress and the action of Congress in carrying that power into execution.' On direct appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, this Court noted probable jurisdiction, Mackey v. Mendoza-Martinez, 359 U.S. 933, 79 S.Ct. 648, 3 L.Ed.2d 635, and then of its own motion remanded the cause, this time with permission to the parties to amend the pleadings to put in issue the question of whether the facts as determined on the draft-evasion conviction in 1947 collaterally estopped the Attorney General from now claiming that Mendoza-Martinez had lost his American citizenship while in Mexico. Mackey v. Mendoza-Martinez, 362 U.S. 384, 80 S.Ct. 785, 4 L.Ed.2d 812.\n\n\n6\nThe District Court on remand held that the Government was not collaterally estopped because the 1947 criminal proceedings entailed no determination of Mendoza-Martinez' citizenship. The court, however, reaffirmed its previous holding that \u00a7 401(j) is unconstitutional, adding as a further basis of invalidity that \u00a7 401(j) is 'essentially penal in character and deprives the plaintiff of procedural due process. * * * (T)he requirements of procedural due process are not satisfied by the administrative hearing of the Immigration Service nor in this present proceedings.'3 The Attorney General's current appeal is from this decision. Probable jurisdiction was noted on February 20, 1961, Rogers v. Mendoza-Martinez, 365 U.S. 809, 81 S.Ct. 691, 5 L.Ed.2d 689. The case was argued last Term, and restored to the calendar for reargument this Term, 369 U.S. 832, 82 S.Ct. 863, 7 L.Ed.2d 841.\n\n\n7\nB. Cort\u2014No. 3.\n\n\n8\nCort, the appellee in No. 3, is also a native-born American, born in Boston in 1927. Unlike Mendoza-Martinez, he has no dual nationality. His wife and two young children are likewise American citizens by birth. Following receipt of his M.D. degree from the Yale University School of Medicine in 1951, he went to England for the purpose of undertaking a position as a Research Fellow at Cambridge University. He had earlier registered in timely and proper fashion for the draft and shortly before his departure supplemented his regular Selective Service registration by registering under the newly enacted Doctors Draft Act.4 In late 1951 he received a series of letters from the American Embassy in London instructing him to deliver his passport to it to be made 'valid only for return to the United States.' He did not respond to these demands because, he now says in an affidavit filed in the trial court in this proceeding, 'I believed that they were unlawful and I did not wish to subject myself to this and similar forms of political persecution then prevalent in the United States. * * * I was engaged in important research and teaching work in physiology and I desired to continue earning a livelihood for my family.' Cort had been a member of the Communist Party while he was a medical student at Yale from 1946 to 1951, except for the academic year 1948\u20141949 when he was in England. In late 1952, while still in England at Cambridge, he accepted a teaching position for the following academic year at Harvard University Medical School. When, however, the school discovered through further correspondence that he had not yet fulfilled his military obligations, it advised him that it did not regard his teaching position as essential enough to support his deferment from military service in order to enter upon it. Thereafter, his local draft board in Brookline, Massachusetts, notified him in February 1953 that his request for deferment was denied and that he should report within 30 days for a physical examination either in Brookline or in Frankfurt, Germany. On June 4 and on July 3 the draft board again sent Cort notices to report for a physical examination, the first notice for examination on July 1 in Brookline, and the second for examination within 30 days in Frankfurt. He did not appear at either place, and the board on August 13 ordered him to report for induction on September 14, 1953. He did not report, and consequently he was indicted in December 1954 for violation of \u00a7 12(a) of the Selective Service Act of 19485 by reason of his failure to report for induction. This indictment is still outstanding. His complaint in this action states that he did not report for induction because he believed 'that the induction order was not issued in good faith to secure his military services, that his past political associations and present physical disabilities made him ineligible for such service, and that he was being ordered to report back to the United States to be served with a Congressional committee subpoena or indicted under the Smith Act * * *.' Meanwhile, the British Home Office had refused to renew his residence permit, and in mid-1954 he and his family moved to Prague, Czechoslovakia, where he took a position as Senior Scientific Worker at the Cardiovascular Institute. He has lived there since.\n\n\n9\nIn April 1959, his previous United States passport having long since expired, Cort applied at the American Embassy in Prague for a new one. His complaint in this action states that he wanted the passport 'in order to return to the United States with his wife and children so that he might fulfill his obligations under the Selective Service laws and his wife might secure medical treatment for multiple sclerosis.' Mrs. Cort received a passport and came to this country temporarily in late 1959, both for purposes of medical treatment and to facilitate arrangements for her husband's return. Cort's application, however, was denied on the ground that he had, by his failure to report for induction on September 14, 1953, as ordered, remained outside the country to avoid military service and thereby automatically forfeited his American citizenship by virtue of \u00a7 349(a)(10) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which had superseded \u00a7 401(j). The State Department's Passport Board of Review affirmed the finding of expatriation, and the Department's legal adviser affirmed the decision. Cort, through counsel, thereupon brought this suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia for a declaratory judgment that he is a citizen of the United States, for an injunction against enforcement of \u00a7 349(a)(10) because of its unconstitutionality, and for an order directing revocation of the certificate of loss of nationality and issuance of a United States passport to him. Pursuant to Cort's demand, a three-judge court was convened. The court held that he had remained outside the United States to evade military service, but that \u00a7 349(a)(10) is unconstitutional because 'We perceive no substantial difference between the constitutional issue in the Trop case and the one facing us.' It therefore concluded that Cort is a citizen of this country and enjoined the Secretary of State from withholding a passport from Cort on the ground that he is not a citizen and from otherwise interfering with his rights of citizenship. Cort v. Herter, D.C., 187 F.Supp. 683.\n\n\n10\nThe Secretary of State appealed directly to this Court, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252, 1253, which postponed the question of jurisdiction to the hearing of the case on the merits. Herter v. Cort, 365 U.S. 808, 81 S.Ct. 691, 5 L.Ed.2d 690. The preliminary question of jurisdiction was affirmatively resolved last Term, Rusk v. Cort, 369 U.S. 367, 82 S.Ct. 787, 7 L.Ed.2d 809, leaving the issue of the validity of \u00a7 349(a)(10) for decision now, after reargument. 369 U.S., at 380, 82 S.Ct. at 794.\n\n\n11\nBefore we consider the essential question in these cases, the constitutionality of \u00a7\u00a7 401(j) and 349(a)(10), two preliminary issues peculiar to No. 2 must be discussed.\n\nII. THE THREE-JUDGE COURT ISSUE.\n\n12\nAt the threshold in Mendoza-Martinez' case is the question whether the proceeding should have been heard by a three-judge District Court convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2282, which requires such a tribunal as a prerequisite to the granting of any 'interlocutory or permanent injunction restraining the enforcement, operation or execution of any Act of Congress for repugnance to the Constitution of the United States * * *.' If \u00a7 2282 governs this litigation, we are once again faced with the prospect of a remand and a new trial, this time by a three-judge panel. We are, however, satisfied that the case was properly heard by a single district judge, as both parties urge.\n\n\n13\nIn the complaint under which the case was tried the first and second times, Mendoza-Martinez asked for no injunctive relief, and none was granted. In the amended complaint which he filed in 1960 to put in issue the question of collateral estoppel, he added a prayer asking the court to adjudge 'that defendants herein are enjoined and restrained henceforth from enforcing' all deportation orders against him. However, it is abundantly clear from the amended trial stipulation which was entered into by the parties and approved by the judge to 'govern the course of the trial,' that the issues were framed so as not to contemplate any injunctive relief. The first question was articulated only in terms of whether the Government was 'herein estopped by reason of the indictment and conviction of plaintiff for (draft evasion) * * * from denying that the plaintiff is now a national and citizen of the United States.' The second question asked only for a declaration as to whether \u00a7 401(j) was 'unconstitutional, either on its face or as applied to the plaintiff herein.' The conclusion that no request for injunctive relief nor even any contemplation of it attended the case as it went to trial is borne out by the total lack of reference to injunctive relief in the District Court's memorandum opinion, findings of fact and conclusions of law, and judgment. See Mendoza-Martinez v. Rogers, D.C., 192 F.Supp. 1. The relief granted was merely a declaration that the 1944 Amendment 'is unconstitutional, both on its face and as applied to the plaintiff herein,' and '(t)hat the plaintiff is now, and ever since the date of his birth has been, a national and citizen of the United States.' Thus, despite the amendment to Mendoza-Martinez' complaint before the third trial, it is clear that neither the parties nor the judge at any relevant time regarded the action as one in which injunctive relief was material to the disposition of the case. Since no injunction restraining the enforcement of \u00a7 401(j) was at issue, \u00a7 2282 was not in terms applicable to require the convening of a three-judge District Court.\n\n\n14\nWhether an action solely for declaratory relief would under all circumstances be inappropriate for consideration by a three-judge court we need not now decide, for it is clear that in the present case the congressional policy underlying the statute was not frustrated by trial before a single judge. The legislative history of \u00a7 2282 and of its complement, \u00a7 2281,6 requiring three judges to hear injunctive suits directed against federal and state legislation, respectively, indicates that these sections were enacted to prevent a single federal judge from being able to paralyze totally the operation of an entire regulatory scheme, either state or federal, by issuance of a broad injunctive order. Section 2281 'was a means of protection the increasing body of state legislation regulating economic enterprise from invalidation by a conventional suit in equity. * * * The crux of the business is procedural protection against an improvident state-wide doom by a federal court of a state's legislative policy. This was the aim of Congress * * *.' Phillips v. United States, 312 U.S. 246, 250\u2014251, 61 S.Ct. 480, 483, 85 L.Ed. 800. Repeatedly emphasized during the congressional debates on \u00a7 2282 were the heavy pecuniary costs of the unforeseen and debilitating interruptions in the administration of federal law which could be wrought by a single judge's order, and the great burdens entailed in coping with harassing actions brought one after another to challenge the operation of an entire statutory scheme, wherever jurisdiction over government officials could be acquired, until a judge was ultimately found who would grant the desired injunction. 81 Cong.Rec. 479\u2014481, 2142\u20142143 (1937).\n\n\n15\nThe present action, which in form was for declaratory relief and which in its agreed substance did not contemplate injunctive relief, involves none of the dangers to which Congress was addressing itself. The relief sought an the order entered affected an Act of Congress in a totally noncoercive fashion. There was no interdiction of the operation at large of the statute. It was declared unconstitutional, but without even an injunctive sanction against the application of the statute by the Government to Mendoza-Martinez. Pending review in the Court of Appeals and in this Court, the Government has been free to continue to apply the statute. That being the case, there is here no conflict with the purpose of Congress to provide for the convocation of a three-judge court whenever the operation of a statutory scheme may be immediately disrupted before a final judicial determination of the validity of the trial court's order can be obtained. Thus there was no reason whatever in this case to invoke the special and extraordinary procedure of a three-judge court. Compare Schneider v. Rusk, 372 U.S. 224, 83 S.Ct. 621, decided this day.\n\nIII. THE COLLATERAL-ESTOPPEL ISSUE.\n\n16\nMendoza-Martinez' second amended complaint, filed in 1960 pursuant to the suggestion of this Court earlier that year, charged that 'the government of the United States has admitted the fact of his United States citizenship by virtue of the indictment and judgment of conviction (in 1947 for draft evasion) * * * and is therefore collaterally estopped now to deny such citizenship * * *.' The District Court rejected this assertion. Mendoza-Martinez renews it here as an alternative ground for upholding the judgment entered below 'That the plaintiff is now, and ever since the date of his birth has been, a national and citizen of the United States.' 192 F.Supp., at 3.\n\n\n17\nWe too reject Mendoza-Martinez' contention on this point. His argument, stated more fully, is as follows: The Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 applies only to citizens and resident aliens. Both the indictment and the judgment spoke in terms of his having remained the Mexico for the entire period from November 15, 1942, until November 1, 1946, when he returned to this country.7 For the period from September 27, 1944, when \u00a7 401(j) became effective, until November 1, 1946, he could not have been in violation of our draft laws unless he remained a citizen of the United States, since the draft laws do not apply to nonresident aliens. Therefore, he concludes, the Government must be taken to have admitted that he did not lose his citizenship by remaining outside the country after September 27, 1944, because it charged him with draft evasion for that period as well as for the period preceding that date.\n\n\n18\nIt is true that 'as to those matters in issue or points controverted, upon the determination of which the finding or verdict was rendered,' Cromwell v. County of Sac, 94 U.S. 351, 353, 24 L.Ed. 195, the findings in a prior criminal proceeding may estop a party in a subsequent civil action, Emich Motors Corp. v. General Motors Corp., 340 U.S. 558, 568\u2014569, 71 S.Ct. 408, 413 414, 95 L.Ed. 534, and that the United Staes may be estopped to deny even an erroneous prior determination of status, United States v. Moser, 266 U.S. 236, 45 S.Ct. 66, 69 L.Ed. 262. However, Mendoza-Martinez' citizenship status was not at issue in his trial for draft evasion. Putting aside the fact that he pleaded guilty, which in itself may support the conclusion that his citizenship status was not litigated and thereby without more preclude his assertion of estoppel,8 the basic flaw in his argument is in the assertion that he was charged with a continuing violation of the draft laws while he remained in Mexico, particularly after September 27, 1944, the date on which \u00a7 401(j) became effective. He was in fact charged with a violation 'on or about November 15, 1942,' because he 'did knowingly evade service * * * in that he did knowingly depart from the United States and go to a foreign county, namely: Mexico, for the purpose of evading service * * *.' This constituted the alleged violation. The additional language that he 'did there remain until on or about November 1, 1946,' was merely surplusage in relation to the substantive offense, although it might, for example, serve a purpose in relation to problems connected with the tolling of the statute of limitations. No language appears charging the elements of violation\u2014knowledge and purpose to evade in connection with it. The only crime charged is what happened 'on or about November 15, 1942,' and conviction thereon, even if it had entailed a finding as to Mendoza-Martinez' citizenship on that date,9 in nowise estopped the Government with reference to his status after September 27, 1944.\n\n\n19\nThe trial court's judgment was worded no differently. Mendoza-Martinez was convicted of:\n\n\n20\n'Having on or about November 15th 1942, knowingly departed      from the United States to Mexico, for the purpose of evading      service in the land or naval forces of the United States and      having remained there until on or about November 1st 1946.'\n\n\n21\nAgain, the language relating to the time during which Mendoza-Martinez remained in Mexico was not tied to the words stating knowledge and purpose to evade service. Thus, the conviction entailed no actual or necessary finding about Mendoza-Martinez' citizenship status between September 27, 1944, and November 1, 1946, and the Government was not estopped from denying his citizenship in the present proceedings.\n\nIV. THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES.\n\n22\nA. Basic Principles.\n\n\n23\nSince the validity of an Act of Congress is involved, we begin our analysis mindful that the function we are now discharging is 'the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called upon to perform.' Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148, 48 S.Ct. 105, 107, 72 L.Ed. 206 (separate opinion of Holmes, J.). This responsibility we here fulfill with all respect for the powers of Congress, but with recognition of the transcendent status of our Constitution.\n\n\n24\nWe deal with the contending constitutional arguments in the context of certain basic and sometimes conflicting principles. Citizenship is a most precious right. It is expressly guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which speaks in the most positive terms.10 The Constitution is silent about the permissibility of involuntary forfeiture of citizenship rights.11 While it confirms citizenship rights, plainly there are imperative obligations of citizenship, performance of which Congress in the exercise of its powers may constitutionally exact. One of the most important of these is to serve the country in time of war and national emergency. The powers of Congress to require military service for the common defense are broad and far-reaching,12 for while the Constitution protects against invasions of individual rights, it is not a suicide pact. Similarly, Congress has broad power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact legislation for the regulation of foreign affairs. Latitude in this area is necessary to ensure effectuation of this indispensable function of government.13\n\n\n25\nThese principles, stemming on the one hand from the precious nature of the constitutionally guaranteed rights of citizenship, and on the other from the powers of Congress and the related obligations of individual citizens, are urged upon us by the parties here. The Government argues that \u00a7\u00a7 401(j) and 349(a)(10) are valid as an exercise of Congress' power over foreign affairs, of its war power, and of the inherent sovereignty of the Government. Appellees urge the provisions' invalidity as not within any of the powers asserted, and as imposing a cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n\n26\nWe recognize at the outset that we are confronted here with an issue of the utmost import. Deprivation of citizenship particularly American citizenship, which is 'one of the most valuable rights in the world today,' Report of the President's Commission on Immigration and Naturalization (1953), 235\u2014has grave practical consequences. An expatriate who, like Cort, had no other nationality becomes a stateless person\u2014a person who not only has no rights as an American citizen, but no membership in any national entity whatsoever. 'Such individuals as do not possess any nationality enjoy, in general, no protection whatever, and if they are aggrieved by a State they have no means of redress, since there is no State which is competent to take up their case. As far as the Law of Nations is concerned, there is, apart from restraints of morality or obligations expressly laid down by treaty * * * no restriction whatever to cause a State to abstain from maltreating to any extent such stateless individuals.' 1 Oppenheim, International Law (8th ed., Lauterpacht, 1955), \u00a7 291, at 640.14 The calamity is '(n)ot the loss of specific rights, then, but the loss of a community willing and able to guarantee any rights whatsoever * * *.' Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951), 294. The stateless person may end up shunted from nation to nation, there being no one obligated or willing to receive him,15 or, as in Cort's case, may receive the dubious sanctuary of a Communist regime lacking the essential liberties precious to American citizenship.16\n\nB. The Perez and Trop Cases.\n\n27\nThe basic principles here involved, the gravity of the issue, and the arguments bearing upon Congress' power to forfeit citizenship were considered by the Court in relation to different provisions of the Nationality Act of 1940 in two cases decided on the same day less than five years ago: Perez v. Brownell, 356 U.S. 44, 78 S.Ct. 568, and Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 78 S.Ct. 590.\n\n\n28\nIn Perez, \u00a7 401(e), which imposes loss of nationality for '(v)oting in a political election in a foreign state or participating in an election or plebiscite to determine the sovereignty over foreign territory,' was upheld by a closely divided Court as a constitutional exercise of Congress' power to regulate foreign affairs. The Court reasoned that since withdrawal of citizenship of Americans who vote in foreign elections is reasonably calculated to effect the avoidance of embarrassment in the conduct of foreign relations, such withdrawal is within the power of Congress, acting under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Since the Court sustained the application of \u00a7 401(e) to denationalize Perez, it did not have to deal with \u00a7 401(j), upon which the Government had also relied, and it expressly declined to rule on the constitutionality of that section, 356 U.S., at 62, 78 S.Ct., at 578. There were three opinions written in dissent. The principal one, that of The Chief Justice, recognized 'that citizenship may not only be voluntarily renounced through exercise of the right of expatriation but also by other actions in derogation of undivided allegiance to this country,' id., at 68, 78 S.Ct. at 581, but concluded that '(t)he mere act of voting in a foreign election, however, without regard to the circumstances attending the participation, is not sufficient to show a voluntary abandonment of citizenship,' id., at 78, 78 S.Ct., at 586.\n\n\n29\nIn Trop, \u00a7 401(g), forfeiting the citizenship of any American who is guilty of '(d)eserting the military or naval forces of the United States in time of war, provided he is convicted thereof by court martial and as the result of such conviction is dismissed or dishonorably discharged * * *,' was declared unconstitutional. There was no opinion of the Court. The Chief Justice wrote an opinion for four members of the Court, concluding that \u00a7 401(g) was invalid for the same reason that he had urged as to \u00a7 401(e) in his dissent in Perez, and that it was also invalid as a cruel and unusual punishment imposed in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Justice Brennan conceded that it is 'paradoxical to justify as constitutional the expatriation of the citizen who has committed no crime by voting in a Mexican political election, yet find unconstitutional a statute which provides for the expatriation of a soldier guilty of the very serious crime of desertion in time of war,' 356 U.S., at 105, 78 S.Ct., at 600. Notwithstanding, he concurred because 'the requisite rational relation between this statute and the war power does not appear * * *,' id., at 114, 78 S.Ct., at 605. Justice Frankfurter, joined by three other Justices, dissented on the ground that \u00a7 401(g) did not impose punishment at all, let alone cruel and unusual punishment, and was within the war powers of Congress.\n\n\n30\nC. Sections 401(j) and 349(a)(10) as Punishment.\n\n\n31\nThe present cases present for decision the constitutionality of a section not passed upon in either Perez or Trop\u2014s 401(j), added in 1944, and its successor and present counterpart, \u00a7 349(a)(10) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. We have come to the conclusion that there is a basic question in the present cases, the answer to which obviates a choice here between the powers of Congress and the constitutional guarantee of citizenship. That issue is whether the statutes here, which automatically\u2014without prior court or administrative proceedings\u2014impose forfeiture of citizenship, are essentially penal in character, and consequently have deprived the appellees of their citizenship without due process of law and without according them the rights guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, including notice, confrontation, compulsory process for obtaining witnesses, trial by jury, and assistance of counsel. This issue was not relevant in Trop because, in contrast to \u00a7\u00a7 401(j) and 349(a)(10), \u00a7 401(g) required conviction by court-martial for desertion before forfeiture of citizenship could be inflicted. In Perez the contention that \u00a7 401(e) was penal in character was impliedly rejected by the Court's holding, based on legislative history totally different from that underlying \u00a7\u00a7 401(j) and 349(a)(10), that voting in a political election in a foreign state 'is regulable by Congress under its power to deal with foreign affairs.' 356 U.S., at 59, 78 S.Ct., at 576. Compare Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U.S. 114, 9 S.Ct. 231, 32 L.Ed. 623; Hawker v. New York, 170 U.S. 189, 18 S.Ct. 573, 42 L.Ed. 1002; Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435. Indeed, in Trop The Chief Justice observed that 'Section 401(j) decrees loss of citizenship without providing any semblance of procedural due process whereby the guilt of the draft evader may be determined before the sanction is imposed * * *,' 356 U.S., at 94, 78 S.Ct., at 594, and Justice Frankfurter in dissent alluded to the due process overtones of the requirement in \u00a7 401(g) of prior conviction for desertion by court-martial, id., at 116\u2014117, 78 S.Ct., at 606.\n\n\n32\nIt is fundamental that the great powers of Congress to conduct war and to regulate the Nation's foreign relations are subject to the constitutional requirements of due process.17 The imperative necessity for safeguarding these rights to procedural due process under the gravest of emergencies has existed throughout our constitutional history, for it is then, under the pressing exigencies of crisis, that there is the greatest temptation to dispense with fundamental constitutional guarantees which, it is feared, will inhibit governmental action. 'The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances.' Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall, 2, 120\u2014121, 18 L.Ed. 281.18 The rights guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments are 'preserved to every one accused of crime who is not attached to the army, or navy, or militia in actual service.' Id., at 123.19 '(I)f society is disturbed by civil commotion\u2014if the passions of men are aroused and the restraints of law weakened, if not disregarded\u2014these safeguards need, and should receive, the watchful care of those intrusted with the guardianship of the Constitution and laws. In no other way can we transmit to posterity unimpaired the blessings of liberty, consecrated by the sacrifices of the Revolution.' Id., at 124.\n\n\n33\nWe hold \u00a7\u00a7 401(j) and 349(a)(10) invalid because in them Congress has plainly employed the sanction of deprivation of nationality as a punishment\u2014for the offense of leaving or remaining outside the country to evade military service\u2014without affording the procedural safeguards guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.20 Our forefathers 'intended to safeguard the people of this country from punishment without trial by duly constituted courts. * * * And even the courts to which this important function was entrusted, were commanded to stay their hands until and unless certain tested safeguards were observed. An accused in court must be tried by an impartial jury, has a right to be represented by counsel, (and) must be clearly informed of the charge against him * * *.' United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303, 317, 66 S.Ct. 1073, 1080, 90 L.Ed. 1252. See also Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227, 235\u2014238, 60 S.Ct. 472, 476\u2014477, 84 L.Ed. 716.\n\n\n34\nAs the Government concedes, \u00a7\u00a7 401(j) and 349(a)(10) automatically strip an American of his citizenship, with concomitant deprivation 'of all that makes life worth living,' Ng Fung Ho v. White, 259 U.S. 276, 284\u2014285, 42 S.Ct. 492, 495, 66 L.Ed. 938, whenever a citizen departs from or remains outside the jurisdiction of this country for the purpose of evading his military obligations. Conviction for draft evasion, as Cort's case illustrates, is not prerequisite to the operation of this sanction.21 Independently of prosecution, forfeiture of citizenship attaches when the statutory set of facts develops. It is argued that the availability after the fact of administrative and judicial proceedings, including the machinery the Court approved last Term in Rusk v. Cort, 369 U.S. 367, 82 S.Ct. 787, to contest the validity of the sanction meets the measure of due process. But the legislative history and judicial expression with respect to every congressional enactment relating to the provisions in question dating back to 1865 establish that forfeiture of citizenship is a penalty for the act of leaving or staying outside the country to avoid the draft. This being so, the Fifth and Sixth Amendments mandate that this punishment cannot be imposed without a prior criminal trial and all its incidents, including indictment, notice, confrontation, jury trial, assistance of counsel, and compulsory process for obtaining witnesses. If the sanction these sections impose is punishment, and it plainly is, the procedural safeguards required as incidents of a criminal prosecution are lacking. We need go no further.\n\n\n35\nThe punitive nature of the sanction here is evident under the tests traditionally applied to determine whether an Act of Congress is penal or regulatory in character, even though in other cases this problem has been extremely difficult and elusive of solution. Whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint,22 whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment,23 whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter,24 whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment\u2014retribution and deterrence,25 whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime,26 whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it,27 and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned28 are all relevant to the inquiry, and may often point in differing directions. Absent conclusive evidence of congressional intent as to the penal nature of a statute, these factors must be considered in relation to the statute on its face. Here, although we are convinced that application of these criteria to the face of the statutes supports the conclusion that they are punitive, a detailed examination along such lines is unnecessary, because the objective manifestations of congressional purpose indicate conclusively that the provisions in question can only be interpreted as punitive.29 A study of the history of the predecessor of \u00a7 401(j), which 'is worth a volume of logic,' New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, 256 U.S. 345, 349, 41 S.Ct. 506, 507, 65 L.Ed. 963, coupled with a reading of Congress' reasons for enacting \u00a7 401(j), compels a conclusion that the statute's primary function is to serve as an additional penalty for a special category of draft evader.30 Compare Trop v. Dulles, supra, 356 U.S., at 107\u2014110, 78 S.Ct., at 601\u2014603 (Brennan, J., concurring).\n\n\n36\n1. The Predecessor Statute and Judicial Construction.\n\n\n37\nThe subsections here in question have their origin in part of a Civil War 'Act to amend the several Acts heretofore passed to provide for the Enrolling and Calling out the National Forces, and for other Purposes.' Act of March 3, 1865, 13 Stat. 487. Section 21 of that Act, dealing with deserters and draft evaders, was in terms punitive, providing that 'in addition to the other lawful penalties of the crime of desertion,' persons guilty thereof 'shall be deemed and taken to have voluntarily relinquished and forfeited their rights of citizenship and their rights to become citizens * * * and all persons who, being duly enrolled, shall depart the jurisdiction of the district in which he is enrolled, or go beyond the limits of the United States, with intent to avoid any draft into the military or naval service, duly ordered, shall be liable to the penalties of this section.'31\n\n\n38\nThe debates in Congress in 1865 confirm that the use of punitive language in \u00a7 21 was not accidental. The section as originally proposed inflicted loss of rights of citizenship only on deserters. Senator Morrill of Maine proposed amending the section to cover persons who leave the country to avoid the draft, stating, 'I do not see why the same principle should not extend to those who leave the country to avoid the draft.' Cong.Globe, 38th Cong., 2d Sess. 642 (1865). This 'same principle' was punitive, because Senator Morrill was also worried that insofar as the section as originally proposed 'provides for a penalty' to be imposed on persons who had theretofore deserted, there was question 'whether it is not an ex post facto law, whether it is not fixing a penalty for an act already done.' Ibid. Senator Johnson of Maryland attempted to allay Senator Morrill's concern by explaining that\n\n\n39\n'the penalties are not imposed upon those who have deserted,      if nothing else occurs, but only on those who have deserted      and who shall not return within sixty days. The crime for      which the punishment is inflicted is made up of the fact of      an antecedent desertion, and a failure to return within sixty      days. It is clearly within the power of Congress.' Ibid.\n\n\n40\nThis explanation satisfied the Senate sufficiently so that they accepted the section, with Senator Morrill's amendment, although Senator Hendricks of Indiana made one last speech in an effort to convince his colleagues of the bill's ex post facto nature and, even apart from that, of the excessiveness of the punishment, particularly as applied to draft evaders:\n\n\n41\n'It seems to me to be very clear that this section proposes      to punish desertions which have already taken place, with a penalty which the law does not already      prescribe. In other words it is an ex post facto criminal law      which I think we cannot pass. * * * One of the penalties      known very well to the criminal laws of the country is the      denial of the right of suffrage and the right to hold offices      of trust or profit.\n\n\n42\n'It seems to me this objection to the section is very clear,      but I desire to suggest further that this section punishes      desertions that may hereafter take place in the same manner,      and it is known to Senators that one desertion recently      created is not reporting when notified of the draft. * * * I      submit to Senators that it is a horrible thing to deprive a      man of his citizenship, of that which is his pride and honor,      from the mere fact that he has been unable to report upon the      day specified after being notified that he has been drafted.      Certainly the punishment for desertion is severe enough. It      extends now from the denial of pay up to death; that entire      compass is given for the punishment of this offense. Why add      this other? It cannot do any good.' Id., at 643.\n\n\n43\nIn the House, the motion of New York's Representative Townsend to strike the section as a 'despotic measure' which would 'have the effect to deprive fifty thousand, and I do not know but one hundred thousand, people of their rights and privileges,' was met by the argument of Representative Schenck of Ohio, the Chairman of the Military Committee, that 'Here is a penalty that is lawful, wise, proper, and that should be added to the other lawful penalties that now exist against deserters.' Id., at 1155. After Representative Wilson of Iowa proposed an amendment, later accepted and placed in the enacted version of the bill, extending the draft-evasion portion to apply to persons leaving 'the district in which they are enrolled' in addition to those leaving the country, Representative J. C. Allen of Illinois raised the ex post facto objection to the section as a whole. Id., at 1155\u20141156. Representative Schenck answered him much as Senator Johnson had replied in the Senate:\n\n\n44\n'The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. J. C. Allen) misapprehends      this section from not having looked carefully, as I think,      into its language. He thinks it retroactive. It is not so. It      does not provide for punishing those who have deserted in      their character of deserters acquired by having gone before      the passage of the law, but of those only, who, being      deserters, shall not return and report themselves for duty      within sixty days. If the gentleman looks at the language of      the section, he will find that we have carefully avoided      making it retroactive. We give those who have deserted their      country and their flag sixty days for repentance and return.\n\n\n45\n'Mr. J. C. ALLEN. Will not the infliction of this penalty on      those who have failed to return to the Army be an additional      penalty that did not exist at the time they deserted?\n\n\n46\n'Mr. SCHENCK. Yes, sir.\n\n\n47\n'Mr. J. C. ALLEN. Does not that make the law retroactive?\n\n\n48\n'Mr. SCHENCK. They are deserters now. We take them up in      their present status and character as deserters, and punish      them for continuing in that character. The gentleman refers      to lawyers here. I believe he is a good lawyer himself. Does      he not know that if a man steals a horse and runs away with      it to the next county it is a continual act of larceny until      he delivers up the horse?' Id., at 1156.\n\n\n49\nThe significance of these debates is, as these excerpts plainly show, that while there was a difference in both Houses as to whether the statute would be an ex post facto law, there was agreement among all the speakers on both sides of that issue, as well as on both sides of the merits of the bill generally, that deprivation of rights of citizenship for leaving the country to evade the draft was a 'penalty' and 'punishment' for a 'crime' and an 'offense' and a violation of a 'criminal law.'\n\n\n50\nA number of state court judicial decisions rendered shortly after the Civil War lend impressive support to the conclusion that the predecessor of \u00a7\u00a7 401(j) and 349(a)(10), \u00a7 21 of the 1865 statute, was a criminal statute imposing an additional punishment for desertion and draft evasion. The first and most important of these was Huber v. Reily, 53 Pa. 112 (1866), in which, as in most of the cases which followed,32 the plaintiff had brought an action against the election judge of his home township, alleging that the defendant had refused to receive his ballot on the ground that plaintiff was a deserter and thereby disenfranchised under \u00a7 21, and that such refusal was wrongful because \u00a7 21 was unconstitutional. The asserted grounds of invalidity were that \u00a7 21 was an expost facto law, that it was an attempt by Congress to regulate suffrage in the States and therefore outside Congress' sphere of power, and that it proposed to inflict pains and penalties without a trial and conviction, and was therefore prohibited by the Bill of Rights. In an opinion by Justice Strong, later a member of this Court, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court first characterized the statute in a way which compelled discussion of the asserted grounds of unconstitutionality:\n\n\n51\n'The Act of Congress is highly penal. It imposes forfeiture      of citizenship and deprivation of the rights of citizenship      as penalties for the commission of a crime. Its avowed      purpose is to add to the penalties which the law had      previously affixed to the offense of desertion from the military or naval service of the United      States, and it denominates the additional sanctions provided      as penalties.' 53 Pa., at 114\u2014115.\n\n\n52\nIt then answered the ex post facto argument as it had been answered on the floor of Congress, that the offense could as well be in the continued refusal to render service as in the original desertion. The second contention was met with the statement that 'The enactment operates upon an individual offender, punishes him for violation of the Federal law by deprivation of his citizenship of the United States, but it leaves each state to determine for itself whether such an individual may be a voter. It does no more than increase the penalties of the law upon the commission of crime.' Id., at 116. 'The third objection,' the court continued, 'would be a very grave one if the act does in reality impose pains and penalties before and without a conviction by due process of law.' Id., at 116\u2014117. The court then summarized the protections guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, and concluded that it was not consistent with these rights to empower a 'judge of elections or a board of election officers constituted under state laws * * * to adjudge the guilt or innocence of an alleged violator of the laws of the United States.' Id., at 117. However, the court decided that since the penalty contemplated by \u00a7 21 'is added to what the law had previously enacted to be the penalty of desertion, as imprisonment is sometimes added to punishment by fine,' it must have been intended 'that it should be incurred in the same way, and imposed by the same tribunal that was authorized to impose the other penalties for the offence.' Id., at 119. '(T)he forfeiture which it prescribes, like all other penalties for desertion, must be adjudged to the convicted person, after trial by a court-martial, and sentence approved. For the conviction and sentence of such a court there can be no substitute.' Id., at 120. (Emphasis in original.) Accordingly, since the plaintiff had not been so convicted, the court held that he was not disenfranchised.\n\n\n53\nSubsequent state court decisions in the post-Civil War period followed Huber v. Reily, both in result and reasoning. State v. Symonds, 57 Me. 148 (1869); Severance v. Healey, 50 N.H. 448 (1870); Gotcheus v. Matheson, 58 Barb.(N.Y.) 152 (1870); McCafferty v. Guyer, 59 Pa. 109 (1868).\n\n\n54\nUltimately and significantly, in Kurtz v. Moffitt, 115 U.S. 487, 6 S.Ct. 148, 29 L.Ed. 458, a case dealing with the question whether a city police officer had the power to arrest a military deserter, this Court recognized both the nature of the sanction imposed by \u00a7 21 and the attendant necessity of procedural safeguards, approvingly citing the above decisions:\n\n\n55\n'The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 1996 and 1998, which re-enact the act      of March 3, 1865, ch. 79, \u00a7 21, 13 Stat. 490, and subject      every person deserting the military service of the United      States to additional penalties, namely, forfeiture of all      rights of citizenship, and disqualification to hold any      office of trust or profit, can only take effect upon      conviction by a court martial, as was clearly shown by Mr.      Justice Strong, when a judge of the Supreme Court of      Pennsylvania, in Huber v. Reily, 53 Penn.St. 112, and has      been uniformly held by the civil courts as well as by the      military authorities. State v. Symonds, 57 Maine, 148;      Severance v. Healey, 50 N.H. 448; Goetcheus v. Matthewson, 61      N.Y. 420; Winthrop's Digest of Judge Advocate General's      Opinions, 225.' 115 U.S., at 501\u2014502, 6 S.Ct., at 153.\n\n\n56\nSection 21 remained on the books unchanged, except for being distributed in the Revised Statutes as \u00a7\u00a7 1996 and 1998, until 1912, when Congress reenacted it with an amendment making it inapplicable to peacetime violations and giving the President power to mitigate or remit punishment previously imposed on peacetime violators, Act of August 22, 1912, 37 Stat. 356. The legislative history of that amendment is also instructive for our present inquiry. The discussion in both Houses had reference only to the penalties as operative on deserters, no doubt because there was no peacetime draft to evade, but since the 1865 statute dealt without distinction with both desertion and leaving the jurisdiction to evade, there is no reason to suppose the discussion quoted below to be any less applicable to the latter type of misconduct. The House Committee Report, H.R.Rep.No.335, 62d Cong., 2d Sess. (1912), which was quoted in its entirety in the Senate Committee Report, S.Rep.No.910, 62d Cong., 2d Sess. 3\u20146 (1912), stated that 'In addition to the service penalty imposed by the court-martial, the law, as it now stands, imposes the further and most drastic punishment of loss of rights of citizenship * * *. There are in the United States to-day thousands of men who are literally men without a country and their numbers will be constantly added to until the drastic civil-war measure which adds this heavy penalty to an already severe punishment imposed by military law, is repealed.' H.R.Rep.No.335, supra, at 2. In reporting the bill out of the Committee on Naval Affairs, Representative Roberts of Massachusetts, its author, stated that 'the bill now under consideration is intended to remove one of the harshest penalties that can be imposed upon a man for an offense, to wit, the loss of rights to citizenship. * * * (S)uch a drastic penalty was entirely too severe to be imposed upon an American citizen in time of peace.' He detailed the penalties meted out by court-martial for desertion, and then referred to the 'additional penalty of loss of citizenship,' which, he concluded, is 'a barbarous punishment.' 48 Cong.Rec. 2903 (1912). Senator Bristow of Kansas, a member of his chamber's Committee on Military Affairs, also referred in discussing the bill to the forfeiture of rights of citizenship as a 'penalty,' and said that there is no reason why a peacetime offender should be 'punished so severely.' 48 Cong.Rec. 9542 (1912).\n\n\n57\nA somewhat similar amendment had been passed by both Houses of Congress in 1908 but vetoed by the President.33 The House Committee Report on that occasion, H.R.Rep.No.1340, 60th Cong., 1st Sess. (1908), consisted mainly of a letter from the Secretary of the Navy to the Congress, and of his annual report. In both documents he referred to loss of citizenship as a 'punishment,' and as one of the 'penalties' for desertion. Representative Roberts spoke in 1908, as he was to do once more in 1912, of the 'enormity of the punishment' and the 'horrible punishment,' and said, 'Conviction itself under the existing law forfeits citizenship. That is the monstrosity of the law.' 43 Cong.Rec. 111 (1908). The entire discussion, id., at 110\u2014114, was based on the premise that loss of citizenship is a punishment for desertion, the point at issue as in 1912, being whether it was too severe a punishment for peacetime imposition. At one point Representative Roberts said, 'Loss of citizenship is a punishment,' to which Representative Hull of Iowa replied, 'Certainly.' Id., at 114.\n\n\n58\nSection 504 of the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1172, repealed the portion of the 1865 statute which dealt with flight from the jurisdiction to avoid the draft. However, in connection with the provision governing loss of citizenship for desertion, which was enacted as \u00a7 401(g) and declared unconstitutional in Trop v. Dulles, supra, the President's committee of advisers reported that the provisions of the 1865 Act had been 'distinctly penal in character,' and concluded that 'They must, therefore, be construed strictly, and the penalties take effect only upon conviction by a court martial.'34 Codification of the Nationality Laws of the United States, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. 68 (Comm.Print 1939). Section 401(g) was therefore worded so that loss of nationality could only occur upon conviction for desertion by court-martial. When, however, \u00a7 401(j) was enacted in 1944, no such procedural safeguards were built in. See Trop v. Dulles, supra, 356 U.S. at 93\u201494, 78 S.Ct., at 594. Thus, whereas for Justice Brennan concurring in Trop the conclusion that expatriation under \u00a7 401(g) was punishment was 'but the beginning of critical inquiry,' 356 U.S., at 110, 78 S.Ct., at 603, a similar conclusion with reference to \u00a7\u00a7 401(j) and 349(a)(10) is sufficient to sustain the holding that they are unconstitutional.\n\n2. The Present Statutes.\n\n59\nThe immediate legislative history of \u00a7 401(j) confirms the conclusion, based upon study of the earlier legislative and judicial history,35 that it is punitive in nature. The language of the section was, to begin with, quite obviously patterned on that of its predecssor, an understandable fact since the draft of the bill was submitted to the Congress by Attorney General Biddle along with a letter to Chairman Russell of the Senate Immigration Committee, in which the Attorney General referred for precedent to the 1912 reenactment of the 1865 statute. This letter, which was the impetus for the enactment of the bill, was quoted in full text in support of it in both the House and Senate Committee Reports, H.R.Rep. No. 1229, 78th Cong., 2d Sess. 2\u20143 (1944); S.Rep. No. 1075, 78th Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1944), and is set out in the margin.36 The Senate Report stated that it 'fully explains the purpose of the bill.' S.Rep. No. 1075, supra, at 1. The letter was couched entirely in terms of an argument that citizens who had left the country in order to escape military service should be dealt with, and that loss of citizenship was a proper way to deal with them. There was no reference to the societal good that would be wrought by the legislation, nor to any improvement in soldier morale or in the conduct of war generally that would be gained by the passage of the statute. The House Committee Report and the sponsors of the bill endorsed it on the same basis. The report referred for support to the fact that the FBI files showed 'over 800 draft delinquents' in the El Paso area alone who had crossed to Mexico to evade the draft. H.R.Rep. No. 1229, supra, at 2. The obvious inference to be drawn from the report, the example it contained, and the lack of mention of any broader purpose is that Congress was concerned solely with inflicting effective retribution upon this class of draft evaders and, no doubt, on others similarly situated. Thus, on the floor of the House, Representative Dickstein of New York, the Chairman of the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization, explained the bill solely as a means of dealing with 'draft dodgers who left this country knowing that there was a possibility that they might be drafted in this war and that they might have to serve in the armed forces * * *.' He implied that the bill was necessary to frustrate their 'idea of evading military service and of returning after the war is over, and taking their old places in our society.' 90 Cong.Rec. 3261 (1944). Senator Russell, who was manager of the bill as well as Chairman of the Senate Immigration Committee, explained it in similar terms:\n\n\n60\n'Certainly those who, having enjoyed the advantages of living      in the United States, were unwilling to serve their country      or subject themselves to the Selective Service Act, should be      penalized in some measure. * * * Any American citizen who is      convicted of violating the Selective Service Act loses his      citizenship. This bill would merely impose a similar penalty      on those who are not subject to the jurisdiction of our      courts, the penalty being the same as would result in the      case of those who are subject to the jurisdiction of our      courts.' 90 Cong.Rec. 7629 (1944).37\n\n\n61\nThe Senate and House debates, together with Attorney General Biddle's letter, brought to light no alternative purpose to differentiate the new statute from its predecessor. Indeed, as indicated, the Attorney General's letter specifically relied on the predecessor statute as precedent for this enactment, and both the letter and the debates, consistent with the character of the predecessor statute, referred to reasons for the enactment of the bill which were fundamentally retributive in nature. When all of these considerations are weighed, as they must be, in the context of the incontestibly punitive nature of the predecessor statute, the conclusion that \u00a7 401(j) was itself dominantly punitive becomes inescapable. The legislative history of \u00a7 349(a)(10) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which re-enacted \u00a7 401(j), adds nothing to disturb that result.38 Our conclusion from the legislative and judicial history is, therefore, that Congress in these sections decreed an additional punishment for the crime of draft avoidance in the special category of cases wherein the evader leaves the country. It cannot do this without providing the safeguards which must attend a criminal prosecution.39\n\n\n62\nV. CONCLUSION.\n\n\n63\nIt is argued that our holding today will have the unfortunate result of immunizing the draft evader who has left the United States from having to suffer any sanction against his conduct, since he must return to this country before he can be apprehended and tried for his crime. The compelling answer to this is that the Bill of Rights which we guard so jealously and the procedures it guarantees are not to be abrogated merely because a guilty man may escape prosecution or for any other expedient reason. Moreover, the truth is that even without being expatriated, the evader living abroad is not in a position to assert the vast majority of his component rights as an American citizen. If he wishes to assert those rights in any real sense he must return to this country, and by doing that he will subject himself to prosecution. In fact, while he is outside the country evading prosecution, the United States may, by proper refusal to exercise its largely discretionary power to afford him diplomatic protection,40 decline to invoke its sovereign power on his behalf. Since the substantial benefits of American citizenship only come into play upon return to face prosecution, the draft evader who wishes to exercise his citizenship rights will inevitably come home and pay his debt, which within constitutional limits Congress has the power to define. This is what Mendoza-Martinez did, what Cort says he is willing to do, and what others have done.41 Thus our holding today does not frustrate the effective handling of the problem of draft evaders who leave the United States.42\n\n\n64\nWe conclude, for the reasons stated, that \u00a7\u00a7 401(j) and 349(a)(10) are punitive and as such cannot constitutionally stand, lacking as they do the procedural safeguards which the Constitution commands.43 We recognize that draft evasion, particularly in time of war, is a heinous offense, and should and can be properly punished. Dating back to Magna Carta, however, it has been an abiding principle governing the lives of civilized men that 'no freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or disseised or outlawed or exiled * * * without the judgment of his peers or by the law of the land * * *.'44 What we hold is only that, in keeping with this cherished tradition, punishment cannot be imposed 'without due process of law.' Any lesser holding would ignore the constitutional mandate upon which our essential liberties depend. Therefore the judgments of the District Courts in these cases are affirmed.\n\n\n65\nAffirmed.\n\n\n66\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice BLACK, while joining the opinion of the Court, adhere to the views expressed in the dissent of Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, in which Mr. Justice BLACK joined, in Perez v. Brownell, 356 U.S. 44, 79, 78 S.Ct. 568, 586, that Congress has no power to deprive a person of the citizenship granted the native-born by \u00a7 1, cl. 1, of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n67\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, concurring.\n\n\n68\nI join the Court's opinion because I fully agree with the Court's conclusion that Congress has here attempted to employ expatriation as a penal sanction in respect of behavior deemed inimical to an objective whose pursuit is within its assigned powers, and with the reasoning by which that conclusion is reached. So too, I agree that Congress is constitutionally debarred from so employing the drastic, the truly terrifying remedy of expatriation, certainly where no attempt has been made to apply the full panoply of protective safeguards which the Constitution requires as a condition of imposing penal sanctions. However, I deem it appropriate to elaborate somewhat the considerations which impel me to agree with the Court.\n\n\n69\nThis Court has never granted the existence in Congress of the power to expatriate except where its exercise was intrinsically and peculiarly appropriate to the solution of serious problems inevitably implicating nationality. We have recognized the entanglements which may stem from dual allegiance, and have twice sustained statutes which provided for loss of American citizenship upon the deliberate assumption of a foreign attachment. Mackenzie v. Hare, 239 U.S. 299, 36 S.Ct. 106, 60 L.Ed. 297; Savorgnan v. United States, 338 U.S. 491, 70 S.Ct. 292, 94 L.Ed. 287. We have recognized that participation by American nationals in the internal politics of foreign states could dangerously prejudice our diplomacy, and have allowed the use of expatriation as a uniquely potent corrective which precludes recriminations by disowning, at the moment of his provocative act, him who might otherwise be taken as our spokesman or our operative. Perez v. Brownell, 356 U.S. 44, 78 S.Ct. 568, 2 L.Ed.2d 603. The instant cases do not require me to resolve some felt doubts of the correctness of Perez, which I joined. For the Court has never held that expatriation was to be found in Congress' arsenal of common sanctions, available for no higher purpose than to curb undesirable conduct, to exact retribution for it, and to stigmatize it.\n\nI.\n\n70\nIn Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 596, we had before us \u00a7 401(g) of the Nationality Act of 1940, which imposed loss of American nationality following conviction of deserting the armed forces in time of war. We held that statute unconstitutional. Three of my Brethren joined in the opinion of The Chief Justice, who analyzed the case in terms equally applicable to the cases at bar. That plurality opinion in Trop noted that the congressional power to which expatriation under \u00a7 401(g) was said to be relevant was the 'war power.' It concluded that expatriation under \u00a7 401(g) could have no value in furtherance of the war power except as a sanction, to deter or punish desertion; that expatriation so employed was 'punishment' within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment; and that such punishment was unconstitutional because cruel and unusual.1\n\n\n71\nMy concurring views in Trop, separately expressed, were akin to those of the plurality. I shared the view that expatriation could have been employed in \u00a7 401(g) only as a sanction, and I considered this an insufficient predicate for its use\u2014which I believed allowable only where some affirmative and unique relationship to policy was apparent. My premise was the simple and fundamental one that legislation so profoundly destructive of individual rights must keep within the limits of palpable reason and rest upon some modicum of discoverable necessity. I was unable to conclude that \u00a7 401(g) met that elementary test. It was evident that recognizable achievement of legitimate congressional purposes through the expatriation device was at best remote; and that far more promising alternative methods existed and had, in fact, been employed.\n\n\n72\nMy Brother STEWART attempts to distinguish Trop along two fronts: He argues that expatriation is not here employed as 'punishment' in the constitutional sense so that the reasoning of the Trop plurality has no application; and he argues that, the question of punishment aside, expatriation as here employed is a uniquely necessary device not falling within the rationale of my views separately expressed in Trop.\n\n\n73\nMy Brother STEWART discerns in \u00a7 401(j)2 an affirmative instrument of policy and not simply a sanction which must be classed as 'punishment.' The policy objective is thought to be the maintenance of troop morale; a threat to that objective is thought to be the spectacle of persons escaping a military-service obligation by flight; and expatriation of such persons is sustained as a demonstrative counter to that threat. To my mind that would be 'punishment' in the purest sense; it would be naked vengeance. Such an exaction of retribution would not lose that quality because it was undertaken to maintain morale. Indeed, it is only the significance of expatriation as retribution which could render it effective to boost morale\u2014the purpose which, to the dissent, removes expatriation as here used from the realm of the punitive. I do not perceive how expatriation so employed would differ analytically from the stocks or the rack. Because such devices may be calculated to shore up the convictions of the law-abiding by demonstrating that the wicked will not go unscathed, they would not, by the dissent's view, be punitive or, presumably, reachable by the Eighth Amendment.3 I cannot agree to any such proposition, and I see no escape from the conclusion that \u00a7 401(j), before us today, is identical in purpose to \u00a7 401(g) and is quite as 'punitive' as was that statute, which we condemned in Trop.\n\n\n74\nThe dissent finds other distinctions between this case and Trop, quite apart from its untenable position that \u00a7 401(j) is not punitive. It is said that flight from the country to escape the draft, in contrast with desertion, could never be a mere technical offense equivocal in its implications for the loyalty of the offender. But the unshakable fear of physical stress or harm, the intellectual or moral aversion to combat, and the mental aberation which may result in flight are no more inconsistent with underlying loyalty than was Trop's unauthorized abandonment of his post.4 Again, it is suggested that the element of cumulation of punishments which helped expose the futility of expatriation in Trop is missing here, because \u00a7 401(j), unlike \u00a7 401(g), becomes operative without a prior conviction, and applies only in the case of flight beyond our borders. But the Mendoza-Martinez case, in its collateral estoppel issue, prominently displays what would in any case be obvious\u2014that expatriation under \u00a7 401(j) is cumulative with criminal sanctions for draft evasion, for those sanctions apply to fugitives equally as much as to sedentary violators.5\n\n\n75\nNor can Trop rationally be distinguished on the ground that the application of \u00a7 401(j) only the fugitives proves that it was designed to fill a void necessarily left by the ordinary criminal draft-evasion sanctions. The point, as I understand it, is that the ordinary sanctions cannot be brought to bear against a fugitive who declines to come home; but he can be expatriated while he remains abroad, without having to be brought before a tribunal and formally proceeded against. The special virtue of expatriation, it appears, is that it may be accomplished in absentia.\n\n\n76\nAside from the denial of procedural due process, which the Court rightly finds in the scheme, the surface appeal of the argument vanishes upon closer scrutiny.\n\n\n77\nIt simply is not true that expatriation provides an instrumentality specially necessary for imposing the congressional will upon fugitive draft evaders. Our statutes now provide severe criminal sanctions for the behavior in question. The fugitive can return only at the cost of suffering these punishments; the only way to avoid them is to remain away. As to any draft delinquent for whom the prospect of this dilemma would not itself pose a recognizable, formidable deterrent, I fail to see how the addition of expatriation could enhance the effect at all.6 Nor can expatriation affect the fugitive who will not return to be punished\u2014for whom it is thought to be specially designed. For that individual has, ex hypothesi, determined on his own to stay away and so cannot be affected by the withdrawal of his right to return. The sting of the measure is felt only by those like Mendoza-Martinez, who have already returned and been punished, and those like Cort, who desire to return and be punished\u2014those, in other words, as to whom expatriation is patently cumulative with other sanctions. As to the unregenerate fugitive whom it is particularly thought to reach, expatriation is but a display of congressional displeasure. I cannot agree that it is within the power of Congress so to express its displeasure with those who will not return as to destroy the rights and the status of those who have demonstrated their underlying attachment to this country by coming home.\n\n\n78\nIt is apparent, then, that today's cases are governed by Trop no matter which of the two controlling opinions is consulted. Expatriation is here employed as 'punishment,' cruel and unusual here if it was there. Nor has expatriation as employed in these cases any more rational or necessary a connection with the war power than it had in Trop.\n\nII.\n\n79\nMr. Justice STEWART'S dissent would sustain \u00a7 401(j) as a permissible exercise of the 'war power.' The appellants in these cases, on the other hand, place their main reliance on the 'foreign affairs power.' The dissent summarizes the appellants' arguments under this heading but does not purport to pass on them. Because of my conviction that \u00a7 401(j) is unconstitutional no matter what congressional power is invoked in its support, I find it necessary to deal with the foreign affairs arguments advanced by the appellants.\n\n\n80\nInitially, I note that the legislative history as expounded by the dissent fails to reveal that Congress was mindful of any foreign affairs problem to be corrected by the statute. The primary purpose seems to me to have been retributive, the secondary purpose deterrent; and even the morale-boosting purpose discerned by the dissent has nothing to do with foreign affairs. While the obvious fact that Congress was not consciously pursuing any foreign affairs objective may not necessarily preclude reliance on that power as a ground of constitutionality, it does render such reliance initially questionable.\n\n\n81\nProceeding to the appellants' arguments, one encounters first the suggestion that a fugitive draft evade 'can easily cause international complications' while he remains an American citizen, because the United States cannot exercise control over him while he is on foreign soil.\n\n\n82\nSuch a 'problem,' obviously, exists equally with respect to any fugitive from American justice, and cannot be thought confined to draft evaders. Yet it is only fugitive draft evaders who are expatriated. It is, therefore, impossible to agree that Congress was acting on any such inherently unlikely premise as that expatriation was necessary so as to avoid responsibility for those described by \u00a7 401(j).\n\n\n83\nBut, contend the appellants, \u00a7 401(j) is designed to prevent embroilments as well as embarrassments. During wartime, it is argued, our Government would very likely feel impelled to demand of foreign havens the return of our fugitive draft evaders; and such a demand might seriously offend a 'host' country, leading to embroilment. The transparent weakness of this argument\u2014its manifest inconsistency\u2014must be immediately apparent. Surely the United States need not disable itself from making injudicious demands in order to restrain itself from doing so. The argument rests on the possibility that there may be an urgent need to secure a fugitive's return. If that is so, a demand must be made with its attendant risk of embroilment. If expatriating the fugitive makes a demand impossible, it able forever defeats the objective\u2014his return\u2014which would have impelled the demand in the first place. If recapturing fugitives may ever be urgently necessary, it is obvious that automatic expatriation could only be directly opposed to our interest\u2014which requires that the Government be free to choose whether or not to make the demand, in light of all the attendant circumstances.\n\n\n84\nThe appellants have still another argument. It is that whereas the Government is under an obligation to seek the return of the fugitive as long as he remains a citizen, by terminating citizenship 'Congress has eliminated at the outset any further claim that this country would have to the services of these individuals, and has removed all basis for further demands upon them * * *.' This simply is not so. Expatriation may have no effect on a continuing military-service obligation.7 And it is incontrovertible that the power to punish the initial draft-evasion offense continues although citizenship has meanwhile become forfeit. The Government has so argued in addressing itself to the collateral estoppel issue in Mendoza-Martinez. I cannot understand how any obligation to apprehend can be other than coextensive with the power to punish. The Government cannot have it both ways in the same case.\n\nIII.\n\n85\nThe appellants urge that, wholly apart from any explicit congressional power, \u00a7 401(j) may be sustained as an exercise of a power inherent in United States sovereignty. My Brethren who would uphold the statute have not adverted to this possibility except, as I shall point out, as they have adopted in passing certain related arguments.\n\n\n86\nPreliminarily, it is difficult to see what is resolved by the assertion that sovereignty implies a power to expatriate. That proposition may be admitted and yet have no bearing on the problem facing the Court.\n\n\n87\nFor, under our Constitution, only a delimited portion of sovereignty has been assigned to the Government of which Congress is the legislative arm. To say that there inheres in United States sovereignty the power to sever the tie of citizenship does not answer the inquiry into whether that power has been granted to Congress. Any argument that it has been so delegated which eschews reference to the constitutional text must, it appears, make its appeal to some sense of the inevitable fitness of things. The contentions here fall far short of any such standard.\n\n\n88\nIt is too simple to suggest that it is fitting that Congress be empowered to extinguish the citizenship of one who refuses to perform the 'ultimate duty' of rising to the Government's defense in time of crisis. I pause to note that for this Court to lend any credence whatever to such a criterion\u2014as the dissent would, see pp. 214\u2014215, is fraught with the most far-reaching consequences. For if Congress now should declare that a refusal to pay taxes, to do jury duty, to testify, to vote, is no less an abnegation of ultimate duty\u2014or an implied renunciation of allegiance\u2014than a refusal to perform military service, I am unable to perceive how this Court, on the dissent's view, could presume to gainsay such a judgment. But the argument is not saved even by a willingness to accept these consequences. There really is no way to distinguish between the several failures of a citizen's duty I have just enumerated, or to explain why evasion of military service should be visited with this specially harsh consequence, except to recognize that the latter defection is palpably more provocative than the others. But, as I have argued in another context, when conduct is singled out of a class for specially adverse treatment simply because it is specially provocative, there is no escaping the conclusion that punishment is being administered. See Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 635\u2014640, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 1388, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (dissenting opinion). Pursuit of the 'ultimate duty' concept, then, simply reaffirms my conviction that this case is indistinguishable from Trop.\n\n\n89\nThe appellants, however, argue that it is fitting that Congress be empowered to extinguish the citizenship of one who not only refuses to perform his duty, but who also 'repudiates his wider obligation as a citizen to submit to this country's jurisdiction and authority' by fleeing the country in order to escape that duty. It is, once again, difficult to see how this flight-repudiation theory can be confined to draft evasion. Every fugitive from United States justice repudiates American authority over him in equal measure. If the difference lies in the quality of the act of draft evasion, then we are back once again to punishment.\n\n\n90\nThe appellants assert that '(a) government which cannot exert force to compel a citizen to perform his Lawful (Government's emphasis) duty is, to that extent, not sovereign as to him.' The apparent corollary is that congressionally imposed expatriation is, under such circumstances, in effect declaratory of a change in status which has already occurred. But the Government is far from conceding its lack of authority over a fugitive draft evader. It informs us that 'the federal government has the power to order our citizens abroad to return, for any lawful purpose,' citing Blackmer v. United States, 284 U.S. 421, 52 S.Ct. 252, 76 L.Ed. 375. And, in any event, the argument proves far too much, for it would justify expatriation of any American abroad for any reason who would, equally with persons covered by \u00a7 401(j), be outside our Government's power to compel the performance of duty.\n\n\n91\nMr. Justice HARLAN, whom Mr. Justice CLARK joins, dissenting.\n\n\n92\nI agree with and join in Parts I, II, III, and IV of my Brother STEWART'S opinion, leading to the conclusion that \u00a7 401(j) of the Nationality Act of 1940, applicable in No. 2 (Mendoza), is constitutional. I also agree with his conclusion that for the same reasons, the substantive provisions of \u00a7 349(a) (10) of the 1952 Act, applicable in No. 3 (Cort), are constitutional. I disagree, however, with his view that the evidentiary presumption contained in \u00a7 349(a)(10) is unconstitutional. I am content to state my reasons in summary form.\n\n\n93\n1. As I read the opinion below in the Cort case I do not think the District Court relied on the \u00a7 349(a)(10) presumption.1 This view is fortified by several considerations: (i) the constitutionality of the presumption was attacked in Cort's complaint and was briefed by both sides in the District Court; (ii) the text of the presumption itself was set forth in the opinion of the District Court (187 F.Supp., at 684) at only a page or two before the extract quoted in the margin (note 1); and (iii) in these circumstances it is difficult to believe that the lower court, composed of three experienced judges, either inadvertently ignored the presumption or upheld its validity sub silentio. The more likely conclusion is that finding the evidence sufficient without the aid of the presumption, the lower court saw no need for reaching a second constitutional issue.\n\n\n94\nSo viewing that District Court's opinion, I think the evidence was quite sufficient under the 'clear, unequivocal, and convincing' standard of Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U.S. 118, 135, 63 S.Ct. 1333, 1341, 87 L.Ed. 1796, to support the finding below that Cort had remained abroad for the purpose of evading military service.2\n\n\n95\n2. In addition, I see nothing constitutionally wrong with this presumption either on its face or as related to this case. Similar presumptions have been consistently sustained in criminal statutes, where the standard of proof is certainly no less stringent than in denationalization cases. See, e.g., Yee Hem v. United States, 268 U.S. 178, 45 S.Ct. 470, 69 L.Ed. 904; Casey v. United States, 276 U.S. 413, 48 S.Ct. 373, 72 L.Ed. 632; Hawes v. Georgia, 258 U.S. 1, 42 S.Ct. 204, 66 L.Ed. 431; cf. Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U.S. 698, 13 S.Ct. 1016, 37 L.Ed. 905. As regards the requirement that there must be a 'rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed,' Tot v. United States, 319 U.S. 463, 467, 63 S.Ct. 1241, 1245, 87 L.Ed. 1519, this presumption is surely a far cry from that held constitutionally invalid in the Tot case.3 And since we are concerned here only with the presumption as applied in this instance (if indeed it was in fact applied below or must now be resorted to in this Court), it is no answer to suggest that in other instances application of the presumption might be unconstitutional.\n\n\n96\nThus whether or not the \u00a7 349(a)(10) presumption is involved in the Cort case, I believe that the order of denationalization there, as well as in the Mendoza case, should be upheld.4\n\n\n97\nMr. Justice STEWART, with whom Mr. Justice WHITE joins, dissenting.\n\n\n98\nThe Court's opinion is lengthy, but its thesis is simple: (1) The withdrawal of citizenship which these statutes provide is 'punishment.' (2) Punishment cannot constitutionally be imposed except after a criminal trial and conviction. (3) The statutes are therefore unconstitutional. As with all syllogisms, the conclusion is inescapable if the premises are correct. But I cannot agree with the Court's major premise\u2014that the divestiture of citizenship which these statutes prescribe is punishment in the constitutional sense of that term.1\n\nI.\n\n99\nDespite the broad sweep of some of the language of its opinion, the Court as I understand it does not hold that involuntary deprivation of citizenship is inherently and always a penal sanction\u2014requiring the safeguards of a criminal trial. Such a determination would overrule at least three decisive precedents in this Court.\n\n\n100\nNearly 50 years ago the Court held that Congress had constitutional power to denationalize a native-born citizen who married a foreigner but continued to reside here. Mackenzie v. Hare, 239 U.S. 299, 36 S.Ct. 106, 60 L.Ed. 297. The Court there explicitly rejected the argument 'that the citizenship of plaintiff was an incident to her birth in the United States, and, under the Constitution and laws of the United States, it became a right, privilege, and immunity which could not be taken away from her except as a punishment for crime or by her voluntary expatriation.' 239 U.S., at 308, 36 S.Ct., at 107. The power of Congress to denationalize a native-born citizen, without a criminal trial, was reaffirmed in Savorgnan v. United States, 338 U.S. 491, 70 S.Ct. 292, 94 L.Ed. 287. And less than five years ago, in Perez v. Brownell, 356 U.S. 44, 78 S.Ct. 568, 2 L.Ed.2d 603, the Court again upheld this congressional power in an opinion which unambiguously rejected the notion, advanced in that case by the dissenters,2 that the Mackenzie and Savorgnan decisions stand only for the proposition that citizenship may be voluntarily relinquished or abandoned either expressly or by conduct. In short, it has been established for almost 50 years that Congress under some circumstances may, without providing for a criminal trial, make expatriation the consequence of the voluntary conduct of a United States citizen, irrespective of the citizen's subjective intention to renounce his nationality, and irrespective too of his awareness that denationalization will be the result of his conduct.3\n\nII.\n\n101\nThe position taken by the Court today is simply that, unlike the statutes involved in Mackenzie, Savorgnan and Perez, the statutes at issue in the present case employ deprivation of citizenship as a penal sanction. In support of this position, the Court devotes many pages of its opinion to a discussion of a quite different law, enacted in 1865, amended in 1912, and repealed in 1940. That law4 provided for forfeiture of the 'rights of citizenship' as an additional penalty for deserters from the armed forces and for enrolled draftees who departed from their district or from the United States 'to avoid any draft into the military or naval service, duly ordered * * *.' That statute, as the Court correctly says, 'was in terms punitive,' and I agree with the Court that the statute's legislative history, as well as subsequent judicial decisions construing it, makes it clear that the law was punitive\u2014imposing additional punishment upon those convicted of either of the offenses mentioned.5\n\n\n102\nIn these cases, however, we have before us statutes which were enacted in 1944 and 1952, respectively. In construing these statutes, I think nothing is to be gained from the legislative history of a quite different law enacted by a quite different Congress in 1865, nor from the reports of still another Congress which amended that law in 1912. Unlike the 1865 law, the legislation at issue in the cases before us is not 'in terms punitive.' And there is nothing in the history of this legislation which persuades me that these statutes, though not in terms penal, nonetheless embody a purpose of the Congresses which enacted them to impose criminal punishment without the safeguards of a criminal trial.\n\n\n103\nUnlike the two sections of the Nationality Act of 1940 which were in issue in Perez v. Brownell6 and Trop v. Dulles,7 \u00a7 401(j) did not have its genesis in the Cabinet Committee's draft code which President Roosevelt submitted to Congress in 1938.8 Indeed, \u00a7 401(j) was the product of a totally different environment\u2014the experience of a nation engaged in a global war.\n\n\n104\nOn February 16, 1944, Attorney General Biddle addressed a letter to the Chairman of the Senate Immigration Committee, calling attention to circumstances which had arisen after the institution of the draft in World War II, and suggesting the legislation which subsequently became \u00a7 401(j). The Attorney General's letter stated in part:\n\n\n105\n'I invite your attention to the desirability of enacting      legislation which would provide (1) for the expatriation of      citizens of the United States who in time of war or during a      national emergency leave the United States or remain outside      thereof for the purpose of evading service in the armed      forces of the United States and (2) for the exclusion from      the United States of aliens who leave this country for the      above-mentioned purpose.\n\n\n106\n'Under existing law a national of the United States, whether      by birth or by naturalization, becomes expatriated by      operation of law if he (1) obtains naturalization in a      foreign state; (2) takes an oath of allegiance to a foreign      country; (3) serves in the armed forces of a foreign state if      he thereby acquires the nationality of such foreign state;      (4) accepts employment under a foreign state for which only      nationals of such state are eligible; (5) votes in a      political election in a foreign state or participates in an      election or plebiscite to determine the sovereignty over      foreign territory; (6) makes a formal renunciation of      nationality before a diplomatic or consular officer of the      United States in a foreign state; (7) deserts from the armed      forces of the United States in time of war and is convicted      thereof by a court martial; or (8) is convicted of treason      (U.S.C., title 8, sec. 801). Machinery is provided whereby a      person who is denied any right or privilege of citizenship on      the ground that he has become expatriated may secure a      judicial determination of his status; and if he is outside of      the United States he is entitled to a certificate of identity which permits him to enter and remain      in the United States until his status has been determined by      the courts (Nationality Act of 1940, sec. 503; U.S.C., title      8, sec. 903).\n\n\n107\n'The files of this Department disclose that at the present      time there are many citizens of the United States who have      left this country for the purpose of escaping service in the      armed forces. While such persons are liable to prosecution      for violation of the Selective Service and Training Act of      1940, if and when they return to this country, it would seem      proper that in addition they should lose their United States      citizenship. Persons who are unwilling to perform their duty      to their country and abandon it during its time of need are      much less worthy of citizenship than are persons who become      expatriated on any of the existing grounds.\n\n\n108\n'Accordingly, I recommend the enactment of legislation which      would provide (1) for the expatriation of citizens of the      United States who in time of war or during a national      emergency leave the United States or remain outside thereof      for the purpose of evading service in the armed forces of the      United States and (2) for the exclusion from the United      States of aliens who leave this country for that purpose. Any      person who may be deemed to have become expatriated by      operation of the foregoing provision would be entitled to      have his status determined by the courts pursuant to the      abovementioned section of the Nationality Act of 1940.'9\n\n\n109\nThe bill was passed unanimously by both the House and the Senate, and became Public Law No. 431 of the Seventy-eighth Congress. Neither the committee reports nor the limited debate on the measure in Congress adds any substantial gloss to the legislative action.10 And the legislative history of \u00a7 349(a) (10) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, the statute directly involved in the second of the two cases now before us, gives no additional illumination as to the purpose of the Eighty-second Congress, since the substantive provisions of that statute were but a recodification of \u00a7 401(j) of the 1940 Act.11\n\n\n110\nThe question of whether or not a statute is punitive ultimately depends upon whether the disability it imposes is for the purpose of vengeance or deterrence, or whether the disability is but an incident to some broader regulatory objective. See Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 320, 322, 18 L.Ed. 356; United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303, 308\u2014312, 66 S.Ct. 1073, 1077, 90 L.Ed. 1252; Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S., at 107\u2014109, 78 S.Ct., at 601\u2014603; See generally, Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 613\u2014617, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 1373\u20141376, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435; cf. De Veau v. Braisted, 363 U.S. 144, 160, 80 S.Ct. 1146, 1154, 4 L.Ed.2d 1109; Communist Party of United States v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 367 U.S. 1, 83\u201488, 81 S.Ct. 1357, 1403\u20141406, 6 L.Ed.2d 625. In commenting on the nature of this kind of inquiry, the Court said in Flemming v. Nestor, 'We observe initially that only the clearest proof could suffice to establish the unconstitutionality of a statute on such a ground. Judicial inquiries into Congressional motives are at best a hazardous matter, and when that inquiry seeks to go behind objective manifestations it becomes a dubious affair indeed. Moreover, the presumption of constitutionality with which this enactment, like any other, comes to us forbids us lightly to choose that reading of the statute's setting which will invalidate it over that which will save it.' 363 U.S., at 617, 80 S.Ct., at 1376.\n\n\n111\nIn the light of the standard enunciated in Nestor, I can find no clear proof that the prime purpose of this legislation was punitive. To be sure, there is evidence that the deterrent effect of the legislation was considered. Moreover, the attitude of some members of Congress toward those whom the legislation was intended to reach was obviously far from neutral. But the fact that the word 'penalty' was used by an individual Senator in the congressional debates is hardly controlling. As The Chief Justice has so wisely remarked, 'How simple would be the tasks of constitutional adjudication and of law generally if specific problems could be solved by inspection of the labels pasted on them!'12\n\n\n112\nIt seems clear to me that these putative indicia of punitive intent are far overbalanced by the fact that this legislation dealt with a basic problem of wartime morale reaching far beyond concern for any individual affected. The legislation applies only to those who have left this country or remained outside of it for the purpose of avoiding the draft. Congress can reasonably be understood to have been saying that those who flee the country for such express purposes do more than simply disobey the law and avoid the imposition of criminal sanctions. They disassociate themselves entirely from their nation, seeking refuge from their wartime obligations under the aegis of another sovereign. Congress could reasonably have concluded that the existence of such a group, who voluntarily and demonstrably put aside their United States citizenship 'for the duration,' could have an extremely adverse effect upon the morale and thus the war effort not only of the armed forces, but of the millions enlisted in the defense of their nation on the civilian front. During the consideration of \u00a7 401(j) in Congress there were repeated references to the expectation that fugitive draft evaders then living abroad would return to this country after the war to resume citizenship and to enjoy the fruits of victory. The effect upon wartime morale of the known existence of such a group, while perhaps not precisely measurable in terms of impaired military efficiency, could obviously have been considered substantial. Denationalization of this class of voluntary expatriates was a rational way of dealing with this problem by removing its visible cause. In light of this broader purpose, I cannot find, as the Court does, that \u00a7 401(j) was motivated primarily by the desire to wreak vengeance upon these individuals who fled the country to avoid military service. Rather, the statute seems to me precisely the same kind of regulatory measure, rational and efficacious, which this Court upheld against similar objections in Perez v. Brownell, supra.13\n\nIII.\n\n113\nFor the reasons stated, I cannot find in the terms of these statutes or in their legislative history anything close to the 'clearest proof' that the basic congressional purpose was to impose punishment. But that alone does not answer the constitutional inquiry in these cases. As with any other exercise of congressional power, a law which imposes deprivation of citizenship, to be constitutionally valid, must bear a rational relationship to an affirmative power possessed by Congress under the Constitution. The appellants submit that in enacting this legislation, Congress could rationally have been drawing on any one of three sources of recognized constitutional power: the implied power to enact legislation for the effective conduct of foreign affairs; the express power to wage war, to raise armies, and to provide for the common defense; and the inherent attributes of sovereignty.\n\n\n114\nThe appellants argue that this legislation, like the statutory provision sustained in Perez v. Brownell, supra, has a direct relationship to foreign affairs. They point out that international complications could arise if this country attempted to effect the return of citizen draft evaders by requests to a foreign sovereign which that nation might be unwilling to grant. The appellants insist that the possibility of international embroilments resulting from problems caused by fugitive draft evaders is not fanciful, pointing to the background of international incidents preceding the War of 1812, and the long history, later in the nineteenth century, of this country's involvement with other nations over the asserted liability of our naturalized citizens to military obligations imposed by their native countries.14 Expatriation of those who leave or remain away from the United States with draft evasion as their purpose, the appellants say, might reasonably be attributed to a congressional belief that this was the only practical way to nip these potential international problems in the bud. Compare Perez v. Brownell, 356 U.S., at 60, 78 S.Ct., at 577; Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S., at 106, 78 S.Ct., at 600 (concurring opinion).\n\n\n115\nIn the view I take of this case, it is unnecessary to pursue further an inquiry as to whether the power to regulate foreign affairs could justify denationalization for the conduct in question. For I think it apparent that Congress in enacting the statute was drawing upon another power, broad and far reaching.\n\n\n116\nA basic purpose of the Constitution was to 'provide for the common defence.' To that end, the Framers expressly conferred upon Congress a compendium of powers which have come to be called the 'war power.'15 Responsive to the scope and magnitude of ultimate national need, the war power is 'the power to wage war successfully.' See Charles Evans Hughes, War Powers under the Constitution, 42 A.B.A.Rep. 232, 238.\n\n\n117\nIt seems to me evident that Congress was drawing upon this power when it enacted the legislation before us. To be sure, the underlying purpose of this legislation can hardly be refined to the point of isolating one single, precise objective. The desire to end a potential drain upon this country's military manpower was clearly present in the minds of the legislators and would itself have constituted a purpose having sufficient rational nexus to the exercise of the war power. Indeed, there is no more fundamental aspect of this broad power than the building and maintaining of armed forces sufficient for the common defense. Selective Draft Law Cases, (Arver v. United States) 245 U.S. 366, 38 S.Ct. 159, 62 L.Ed. 349; see Falbo v. United States, 320 U.S. 549, 64 S.Ct. 346, 88 L.Ed. 305. But, in any event, the war power clearly supports the objective of removing a corrosive influence upon the morale of a nation at war. As the Court said in Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 93, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 1382, 87 L.Ed. 1774, the war power 'extends to every matter and activity so related to war as substantially to affect its conduct and progress. The power is not restricted to the winning of victories in the field and the repulse of enemy forces. It embraces every phase of the national defense, including the protection of war materials and the members of the armed forces from injury and from the dangers which attend the rise, prosecution and progress of war.' See Lichter v. United States, 334 U.S. 742, 68 S.Ct. 1294, 92 L.Ed. 1694.\n\n\n118\nThis legislation is thus quite different from the statute held invalid in Trop v. Dulles, supra. In that case there were not five members of the Court who were able to find the 'requisite rational relation' between the war power of Congress and \u00a7 401(g) of the 1940 Act imposing denationalization upon wartime deserters from the armed forces. As the concurring opinion pointed out, the statute was 'not limited in its effects to those who desert in a foreign country or who flee to another land.' 356 U.S., at 107, 78 S.Ct., at 601. Indeed, 'The Solicitor General acknowledged that forfeiture of citizenship would have occurred if the entire incident had transpired in this country.' 356 U.S., at 92, 78 S.Ct., at 593. It was emphasized that conduct far short of disloyalty could technically constitute the military offense of desertion, 356 U.S., at 112, 113, 78 S.Ct., at 604, 605, and that the harshness of denationalization for conduct so potentially equivocal was 'an important consideration where the asserted power to expatriate has only a slight or tenuous relation to the granted power.' 356 U.S., at 110, 78 S.Ct., at 603.\n\n\n119\nThe legislation now before us, on the other hand, is by its terms completely inapplicable to those guilty of draft evasion who have remained in the United States; it is exclusively aimed at those, whether or not ever criminally convicted, who have gone to or remained in another land to escape the duty of military service. Moreover, the conduct which the legislation reaches could never be equivocal in nature, but is always and clearly a 'refusal to perform this ultimate duty of American citizenship.' Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S., at 112, 78 S.Ct., at 604 (concurring opinion).\n\nIV.\n\n120\nThere is one more point to be made as to the substantive provisions of the legislation before us in these cases. Previous decisions have suggested that congressional exercise of the power to expatriate may be subject to a further constitutional restriction\u2014a limitation upon the kind of activity which may be made the basis of denationalization. Withdrawal of citizenship is a drastic measure. Moreover, the power to expatriate endows government with authority to define and to limit the society which it represents and to which it is responsible.\n\n\n121\nThis Court has never held that Congress' power to expatriate may be used unsparingly in every area in which it has general power to act. Our previous decisions upholding involuntary denationalization all involved conduct inconsistent with undiluted allegiance to this country. But I think the legislation at issue in these cases comes so clearly within the compass of those decisions as to make unnecessary in this case an inquiry as to what the ultimate limitation upon the expatriation power may be.\n\n\n122\nThe conduct to which this legislation applies, involving not only the attribute of flight or absence from this country in time of war or national emergency, but flight or absence for the express purpose of evading the duty of helping to defend this country, amounts to an unequivocal and conspicuous manifestation of nonallegiance, whether considered objectively or subjectively. Ours is a tradition of the citizen soldier. As this Court has said, '(T)he very conception of a just government and its duty to the citizen includes the reciprocal obligation of the citizen to render military service in case of need and the right to compel it.' Selective Draft Law Cases, (Arver v. United States) 245 U.S. 366, at 378, 38 S.Ct. 159, at 161. It is hardly an improvident exercise of constitutional power for Congress do disown those who have disowned this Nation in time of ultimate need.\n\nV.\n\n123\nFor the reasons stated, I believe the substantive provisions of \u00a7 401(j) of the 1940 Act and of \u00a7 349(a)(10) of the 1952 Act are constitutionally valid. In addition to its substantive provisions, however, \u00a7 349(a)(10) declares:\n\n\n124\n'For the purposes of this paragraph failure to comply with      any provision of any compulsory service laws of the United      States shall raise the presumption that the departure from or      absence from the United States was for the purpose of evading      or avoiding training and service in the military, air, or      naval forces of the United States.'\n\n\n125\nI think the evidentiary presumption which the statute creates is clearly invalid, and that it fatally infected the administrative determination that Joseph Henry Cort had lost his citizenship.\n\n\n126\nThe District Court did not mention this statutory presumption, and it is, therefore, impossible to know how much the court relied upon it, if at all. Indeed, the District Court's attention in this case was oriented primarily towards the issue of its jurisdiction and the basic issue of the constitutionality of the substantive provisions of \u00a7 349(a)(10). In view of its holding that \u00a7 349(a)(10) is unconstitutional, the court understandably did not give exhaustive attention to the factual issues presented, devoting but a single short paragraph to the question of whether Cort's conduct had brought him within the statute. 187 F.Supp., at 686.\n\n\n127\nBut it is clear that the final reviewing agency in the State Department relied heavily upon this presumption in determining that Cort had lost his citizenship. The Board of Review on the Loss of Nationality, in its memorandum affirming the initial administrative determination that Cort had lost his citizenship, stated that '(b)y failing to comply with the notices sent to him by his local board, Dr. Cort brought upon himself the presumption mentioned in Section 349(a)(10), that his continued absence from the United States was for the purpose of evading or avoiding training and service in the military, air, or naval forces of the United States. Even if the Board should consider that the presumption could be overcome by showing that a person remained abroad for a purpose other than to avoid the military service, the evidence in Dr. Cort's case, taken as a whole, does not show that he remained abroad for a purpose other than to avoid being drafted.' (Emphasis added.) One of the Board's specific findings was 'that Dr. Cort has not overcome the presumption raised in the last sentence of Section 349(a)(10) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.'\n\n\n128\nAs was said in Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, at 520\u2014521, 78 S.Ct. 1332, at 1339, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460, 'it is commonplace that the outcome of a lawsuit\u2014and hence the vindication of legal rights\u2014depends more often on how the factfinder appraises the facts than on a disputed construction of a statute or interpretation of a line of precedents. Thus the procedures by which the facts of the case are determined assume an importance fully as great as the validity of the substantive rule of law to be applied. And the more important the rights at stake the more important must be the procedural safe-guards surrounding those rights.'\n\n\n129\nThe presumption created by \u00a7 349(a)(10) is wholly at odds with the decisions of the Court which hold that in cases such as this a heavy burden is upon the Government to prove an act of expatriation by clear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence. Gonzales v. Landon, 350 U.S. 920, 76 S.Ct. 210, 100 L.Ed. 806; Nishikawa v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 129, 78 S.Ct. 612, 2 L.Ed.2d 659. This standard commands that 'evidentiary ambiguities are not to be resolved against the citizen.' Nishikawa v. Dulles, 356 U.S., at 136, 78 S.Ct., at 617.\n\n\n130\nWithout pausing to consider whether this evidentiary standard is a constitutional one, it is clear to me that the statutory presumption here in question is constitutionally invalid because there is insufficient 'rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed.' Tot v. United States, 319 U.S. 463, 467, 63 S.Ct. 1241, 1245, 87 L.Ed. 1519. 'A statute creating a presumption that is arbitrary or that operates to deny a fair opportunity to repeal it violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.' Manley v. Georgia, 279 U.S. 1, 6, 49 S.Ct. 215, 217, 73 L.Ed. 575. A federal statute which creates such a presumption is no less violative of Fifth Amendment due process. 'Mere legislative fiat may not take the place of fact in the determination of issues involving life, liberty or property.' Ibid. It is 'essential that there shall be some rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed, and that the inference of one fact from proof of another shall not be so unreasonable as to be a purely arbitrary mandate.' Mobile, J. & K.C.R. Co. v. Turnipseed, 219 U.S. 35, 43, 31 S.Ct. 136, 138, 55 L.Ed. 78. Cf. Speiser v. Randall, supra.\n\n\n131\nThe failure of a person abroad to comply with notices sent by his draft board would obviously be relevant evidence in determining whether that person had gone or remained abroad for the purpose of avoiding military service. But the statute goes much further. It creates a presumption of an expatriating act from failure to comply with 'any provision of any compulsory service laws' by a citizen abroad, regardless of the nature of the violations and regardless of the innocence of his purpose in originally leaving the United States. The various compulsory service laws of the United States contain a multitude of provisions, many of them technical or relatively insignificant. To draw from the violation of a single such provision a presumption of expatriation, with its solemn consequences, is, I think, to engaged in irrationality so gross as to be constitutionally impermissible.16\n\n\n132\nIt is clear from the record in this case that Court's sole purpose in leaving the United States in 1951 was to accept a position as a Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge, England. The record also makes clear that in 1946 Cort was called up under the Selective Service law, physically examined, and classified as 4F because of physical disability. The record further shows that Cort voluntarily registered under the Doctors Draft Act, making special arrangements with his draft board to do so in advance of the effective date for registration under the statute, a few days before he left for Europe. Cort filed an affidavit in which he swore that it was his belief, in the light of his physical disability, that the induction order which he received in England was not issued in good faith to secure his military service, but that its purpose instead was to force him to return to the United States to be investigated by the House Committee on Un-American Activities or prosecuted under the Smith Act. He has made repeated efforts to arrange with Selective Service officials for the fulfillment, albeit belatedly, of his military obligations, if any, and in 1959 his wife came to the United States and met with officials of the Selective Service system for that purpose. The very reason he applied in Prague for a United States passport was, as he swore, so that he could return to the United States in order to respond to the indictment for draft evasion now pending against him in Massachusetts and to fulfill his Selective Service obligations, if any. When Cort applied in Prague for a passport, the American Consul there, who interviewed him, stated his opinion in writing that he had no reason to disbelieve Cort's sworn statement that he had not remained outside the United States to avoid military service.17 I mention this evidence as disclosed by the present record only to indicate why I think a new administrative hearing freed from the weight of the statutory presumption is in order, not to imply any prejudgment of what I think the ultimate administrative decision should be.\n\n\n133\nIn No. 3, Rusk v. Cort, I would vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand the case with instructions to declare null and void the certificate of loss of nationality issued to Court by the Secretary of State, so that upon Cort's renewed application for a passport, an administrative hearing could be had, free of the evidentiary presumption of \u00a7 349(a)(10). In the event that such administrative proceedings should result in a finding that Cort had lost his United States citizenship, he would be entitled to a de novo judicial hearing18 in which the Government would have the burden of proving an act of expatriation by clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence. Gonzales v. Landon, 350 U.S. 920, 76 S.Ct. 210, 100 L.Ed. 806; Nishikawa v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 129, 78 S.Ct. 612, 2 L.Ed.2d 659.\n\n\n134\nIn No. 2, Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, I would reverse the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n\n1\n In question in No. 2, Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, is \u00a7 401(j) of the Nationality Act of 1940, added in 1944, 58 Stat. 746, which reads in full as follows:\n'A person who is a national of the United States, whether by birth or naturalization, shall lose his nationality by * * *\n'(j) Departing from or remaining outside of the jurisdiction of the United States in time of war or during a period declared by the President to be a period of national emergency for the purpose of evading or avoiding training and service in the land or naval forces of the United States.'\nIts successor and counterpart, \u00a7 349(a)(10) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 267\u2014268, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(a)(10), is challenged in No. 3, Rusk v. Cort, and reads as follows:\n'From and after the effective date of this Act a person who is a national of the United States whether by birth or naturalization, shall lose his nationality by\u2014* * *\n'(10) departing from or remaining outside of the jurisdiction of the United States in time of war or during a period declared by the President to be a period of national emergency for the purpose of evading or avoiding training and service in the military, air, or naval forces of the United States. For the purposes of this paragraph failure to comply with any provision of any compulsory service laws of the United States shall raise the presumption that the departure from or absence from the United States was for the purpose of evading or avoiding training and service in the military, air, or naval forces of the United States.'\n\n\n2\n 54 Stat. 894, as amended, 50 U.S.C.App. (1946 ed.) \u00a7 311.\n\n\n3\n The memorandum opinion in which the quoted statement appears is unreported, but the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and judgment of the court are reported at Mendoza-Martinez v. Rogers, D.C., 192 F.Supp. 1.\n\n\n4\n 64 Stat. 826, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 454 et seq.\n\n\n5\n 62 Stat. 622, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 462(a). The short title of the Act has since 1951 been the Universal Military Training and Service Act. 65 Stat. 75, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 451(a).\n\n\n6\n In more detail, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281 requires a three-judge court to be convened in order to grant 'An interlocutory or permanent injunction restraining the enforcement, operation or execution of any State statute by restraining the action of any officer of such State in the enforcement or execution of such statute or of an order made by an administrative board or commission acting under State statutes * * * upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute * * *.'\n\n\n7\n The indictment was in three counts, but Mendoza-Martinez was convicted only on Count I, which reads in full as follows:\n'Defendant Frank Martinez Mendoza, a male person within the class made subject to selective service under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended, registered as required by said act and the regulations promulgated thereunder and became a registrant of Local Board No. 137, said board being then and there duly created and acting, under the Selective Service System established by said act, in Kern County, California, in the Northern Division of the Southern District of California; and on or about November 15, 1942, in violation of the provisions of said act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the defendant did knowingly evade service in the land or naval forces of the United States of America in that he did knowingly depart from the United States and go to a foreign country, namely: Mexico, for the purpose of evading service in the land or naval forces of the United States and did there remain until on or about November 1, 1946.'\nThe judgment and commitment, similarly, stated that Mendoza-Martinez was convicted of:\n'Having on or about November 15th 1942, knowingly departed from the United States to Maxico, for the purpose of evading service in the land or naval forces of the United States and having remained there until on or about November 1st 1946.'\n\n\n8\n Compare United States v. International Building Co., 345 U.S. 502, 73 S.Ct. 807, 97 L.Ed. 1182, in which a prior judicial determination of a tax issue, based on the parties' stipulation, was refused collateral-estoppel effect in a later action. See also Restatement, Judgments, \u00a7 68, comments g.h.i.\n\n\n9\n Since the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 applied both to citizens and resident aliens, there was no need to determine in which category Mendoza-Martinez fell 'on or about November 15, 1942.' In the present proceeding it is, of course, not disputed that Mendoza-Martinez was an American citizen on that date.\n\n\n10\n U.S.Const., Amend. XIV, \u00a7 1: 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. * * *' This constitutional statement is to be interpreted in light of pre-existing common-law principles governing citizenship.

V.\n'In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining Witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.' U.S.Const. Amend. VI.\n\n\n21\n Thus the fact that Mendoza-Martinez was, as it happened, convicted of draft evasion before deportation proceedings were brought against him is of no relevance. Even if the incidence of conviction for draft evasion were potentially relevant to the validity of \u00a7\u00a7 401(j) and 349(a)(10), the fact is that the 'crime' created by these sections includes an element not necessary to conviction for violation of \u00a7 11 of the Selective Service and Training Act of 1940\u2014'(d)eparting from or remaining outside' the country 'for the purpose of evading or avoiding (military) training and service * * *.' See Comment, Power of Congress to Effect Involuntary Expatriation, 56 Mich.L.Rev. 1142, 1166 n. 102 (1958). Mendoza-Martinez was thus never tried for any crime the elements of which are identical with or totally inclusory of those of \u00a7 401(j), and hence was not even arguably accorded the procedural protections we here hold essential.\n\n\n22\n Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333, 377, 18 L.Ed. 366; United States v.

Reference to history here is peculiarly appropriate. Though not determinative, it supports our holding to note that forfeiture of citizenship and the related devices of banishment and exile have throughout history been used as punishment. In ancient Rome, 'There were many ways in which a man might loss his freedom, and with his freedom he necessarily lost his citizenship also. Thus he might be sold into slavery as an insolvent debtor, or condemned to the mines for his crimes as servus poenae.' Salmond, Citizenship and Allegiance, 17 L.Q.Rev. 270, 276 (1901). Banishment was a weapon in the English legal arsenal for centuries, 4 Bl.Comm. *377, but it was always 'adjudged a harsh punishment even by men who were accustomed to brutality in the administration of criminal justice.'

United States, 338 U.S. 491, 70 S.Ct. 292, 94 L.Ed. 287, whatever the proposition for which they stand in connection with the power of Congress to impose loss of citizenship, compare Perez v. Brownell, supra, 356 U.S., at 51\u201452, 61\u201462, 78 S.Ct., at 572, 577-578 (opinion of the Court), with id., at 68\u201473, 78 S.Ct., at 581\u2014583 (dissenting opinion of The Chief Justice) and id., at 80, 78 S.Ct. at 587 (dissenting opinion of Justice Douglas), are both plainly distinguishable, as is Perez. The statutes in question in each of those cases provided loss of citizenship for noncriminal behavior instead of as an additional sanction attaching to behavior already a crime, and congressional expression attending their passage lacked the overwhelming indications of punitive purpose which characterized the enactments here. Thus, basing decision as we do on the unmistakable penal intent underlying the statutes presently at issue, nothing in our holding is inconsistent with these other cases, and there is no occasion for us to pass upon any question of the power of Congress to act as it did in the statutes involved in those cases. See note 43, infra.\n\n\n31\n The acts of Mendoza-Martinez and Cort would have been covered by this statute as well as by \u00a7\u00a7 401(j) and 349(a)(10).\n\n\n32\n See p. 31, infra.\n\n\n33\n The President's veto message to the Senate, S.Doc.No.708, 60th Cong., 2d Sess. (1909), indicates that his refusal to approve the measure was premised partly on the fact that it placed the discretion to remit loss of citizenship rights in the Secretary of the Navy and partly on the President's feeling that it 'would actually encourage hardened offenders to commit a heinous crime against the flag and the nation.' Id., at 2. The former was a fault of the particular form of the measure: The President was worried that power to pardon could not constitutionally be vested in anyone other than himself, and he was further disturbed that placing the power in the Secretary of the Navy would result in discrimination against army people. The President's second reason, however, indicates that to him retention of the law as it stood would serve a purpose always sought to be furthered by the imposition of punishment for crime\u2014deterrence. This is borne out by the statements of the President's advisers in recommending that he veto it. The Secretary of War said, 'Loss of citizenship is a substantial part of the punishment, and doubtless has a very considerable effect in deterring desertions.' Id., at 3. The Secretary of the Navy stated that 'It is believed that the present law regarding the loss of citizenship as a penalty for deserters from the navy acts as a deterrent to many.' Ibid. The Attorney General indicated his agreement with the Secretary of the Navy. Id., at 5.\n\n\n34\n The advisers' citation of Huber v. Reily, supra, and Kurtz v. Moffitt, supra, in support of the quoted statement suggests their awareness that an underlying conviction is constitutionally mandated.\n\n\n35\n The relevance of such history in analyzing the character of a present enactment is illustrated by the Court's approach in Helwig v. United States, 188 U.S. 605, 613\u2014619, 23 S.Ct. 427, 429 432, wherein at considerable length it reviewed and relied upon the character of previous relevant legislation in determining whether the statute before it, which imposed an exaction upon importers who undervalued imported goods for duty purposes, was a penalty.\n\n\n36\n 'My Dear Senator: I invite your attention to the desirability of enacting legislation which would provide (1) for the expatriation of citizens of the United States who in time of war or during a national emergency leave the United States or remain outside thereof for the purpose of evading service in the armed forces of the United States, and (2) for the exclusion from the United States of aliens who leave this country for the above mentioned purpose.\n'Under existing law a national of the United States, whether by birth or by naturalization, becomes expatriated by operation of law if he (1) obtains naturalization in a foreign state; (2) takes an oath of allegiance to a foreign country; (3) serves in the armed forces of a foreign state if he thereby acquires the nationality of such foreign state; (4) accepts employment under a foreign state for which only\nnationals of such state are eligible; (5) votes in a political election in a foreign state or participates in an election or plebiscite to determine the sovereignty over foreign territory; (6) makes a formal renunciation of nationality before a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States in a foreign state; (7) deserts from the armed forces of the United States in time of war and is convicted thereof by a court martial; or (8) is convicted of treason (U.S.C., title 8, sec. 801). Machinery is provided whereby a person who is denied any right or privilege of citizenship on the ground that he has become expatriated may secure a judicial determination of his status; and if he is outside of the United States he is entitled to a certificate of identity which permits him to enter and remain in the United States until his status has been determined by the courts (Nationality Act of 1940, sec. 503; U.S.C., title 8, sec. 903).\n'The files of this Department disclose that at the present time there are many citizens of the United States who have left this country for the purpose of escaping service in the armed forces. While such persons are liable to prosecution for violation of the Selective Service and Training Act of 1940, if and when they return to this country, it would seem proper that in addition they should lose their United States citizenship. Persons who are unwilling to perform their duty to their country and abandon it during its time of need are much less worthy of citizenship than are persons who become expatriated on any of the existing grounds.\n'Accordingly, I recommend the enactment of legislation which would provide (1) for the expatriation of citizens of the United States who in time of war or during a national emergency leave the United States or remain outside thereof for the purpose of evading service in the armed forces of the United States, and (2) for the exclusion from the United States of aliens who leave this country for that purpose. Any person who may be deemed to have become expatriated by operation of the foregoing provision, would be entitled to have his status determined by the courts pursuant to the above-mentioned section of the Nationality Act of 1940.\n'Adequate precedent exists for the suggested legislation in that during the First World War a statute was in force which provided\nfor the expatriation of any person who went beyond the limits of the United States with intent to avoid any draft into the military or naval service (37 Stat. 356). This provision was repealed by section 504 of the Nationality Code of 1940 (54 Stat. 1172; U.S.C., title 8, sec. 904).\n'A draft of a proposed bill to effectuate the foregoing purpose is enclosed herewith.\n'I have been informed by the Director of the Bureau of the Budget that the proposed legislation is in accord with the program of the President.\n'Sincerely yours,\n'Attorney General.'\n\n\n37\n The Senator's statement that 'Any American citizen who is convicted of violating the Selective Service Act loses his citizenship' was apparently a reference to \u00a7 401(g), and should accordingly be read in that limited fashion.\n\n\n38\n Section 349(a)(10) did amend \u00a7 401(j) by adding a presumption that failure to comply with any provision of the compulsory service laws of the United States means that the departure from or absence from the United States is for the purpose of avoiding military service. See note 1, supra. Our holding today obviates any necessity for passing upon this provision.\n\n\n39\n Lipke v. Lederer, 259 U.S. 557, 42 S.Ct. 549; United States v.

Times, Oct. 27, 1962, p. 1, col. 1; Oct. 30, 1962, p. 1, col. 2.\n\n\n42\n Moreover, the problem is, relatively, extremely small. Over 16,000,000 men served in our armed forces during World War II, and nearly 6,000,000 more served during the Korean crisis. The World Almanac (1963), 735. Yet between the time of the enactment of \u00a7 401(j) and June 30, 1961, only about 1,750 persons were denationalized for leaving the country to avoid the draft. Compare figures cited in Klubock, supra, at 49, taken from Immigration and Naturalization Service Annual Reports, with figures cited in Comment, The Expatriation Act of 1954, 64 Yale L.J. 1164, 1165, n. 9 (1955), derived partially from correspondence with the General Counsel to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n\n\n43\n The conclusion that the denationalization sanction, as used in \u00a7\u00a7 401(j) and 349(a)(10), is a punishment, obviates any need to determine whether these sections are otherwise within the powers of Congress. That question would have had to be faced only if the foregoing inquiry had disclosed reasons other than punitive for the infliction of loss of nationality in the present context, necessitating decision whether the sections in question were within the powers of Congress as a regulatory scheme, or if the punitive forfeiture of citizenship had been surrounded with appropriate safeguards, obliging decision whether the sections were within the powers of Congress to apply as a criminal sanction.\n\n\n44\n 14 Encyclopaedia Britannica (1957 ed.) 630.\n\n\n1\n The plurality opinion in Trop rested alternatively on the proposition that divestiture of citizenship can result only from a clear renunciation or transfer of allegiance on the part of the citizen. However, since this view had been rejected by a majority of the Court in Perez v. Brownell, supra, the Trop plurality relied principally on the reasoning outlined in the text.\n\n\n2\n My discussion of \u00a7 401(j) is equally applicable to its re-enactment as \u00a7 349(a)(10) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, involved in the Cort case.\n\n\n3\n The examples I have given must, of course, have some deterrent effect upon the conduct for which they are administered. But this could not, in the dissent's view, render them punitive. For expatriation as employed in \u00a7 401(j) must also, in the dissent's view, have some deterrent effect upon draft-evading flight, since if expatriation were not thought by the dissent to be an undesirable consequence, it could not serve the morale-boosting purpose which is attributed to it. (But see p. 192-193, and n. 6.) And, as the dissent recognizes, the legislative purpose was at least in part a deterrent one.\n\n\n4\n The 'purpose of evading or avoiding training and service' specified in \u00a7 401(j) seems no graver a reflection upon loyalty than the 'intent to remain away * * * permanently' or the 'intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service' specified in the definition of desertion codified in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 885. The mere fact that the conduct described in \u00a7 401(j) requires the crossing of a frontier does not guarantee that it will be any less equivocal or more serious than was Trop's desertion. A resident of Texas might, during time of war, cross the border into Mexico intending to evade the draft, then change his mind and return the next day. Such conduct clearly results in expatriation under \u00a7 401(j).\n\n\n5\n It is obvious that \u00a7 401(j) does not reach any conduct not otherwise made criminal by the selective service laws. 62 Stat. 622, 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 462(a), in relevant part identical with Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, \u00a7 11, under which Mendoza-Martinez was prosecuted, provides: '(A)ny person who * * * evades or refuses registration or service in the armed forces or any of the requirements of this title * * *, or who in any manner shall knowingly fail or neglect or refuse to perform any duty required of him under or in the execution of this title, or rules, regulations, or directions made pursuant to this title * * *, shall, upon conviction in any district court of the United States of competent jurisdiction, be punished by imprisonment for not more than five years or a fine of not more than $10,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment * * *.'\n\n\n6\n The prospective fugitive draft evader must consider that if he flees, either (1) he must eventually face criminal fine and imprisonment; or (2) he will not be able to return. To say that prospect (1) will not deter is simply to reject our entire criminal justice as fruitless so far as deterrence is an object. To say that prospect (2) will not deter is simply to concede that expatriation will not deter, either\u2014except on the strained assumption that withdrawal of diplomatic protection can work the difference.\n\n\n7\n As the Government forcefully argues on the collateral estoppel point in Mendoza-Martinez, the selective service requirements apply to resident aliens as well as to citizens. Section 401(j), as discussed in Congress and by the appellants and in Mr. Justice STEWART'S dissent in these cases, seems to reflect a special concern with those who flee 'for the duration,' intending to return after peace is restored. The Government could well argue that such a fugitive, although expatriated, is a resident alien subject to compulsory military service.\n\n\n1\n The District Court said: 'When, as here, a citizenship claimant establishes his birth in the United States the burden is upon the Government to prove by clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence the act it relies upon to show expatriation. Nishikawa v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 129, 133, 78 S.Ct. 612, 2 L.Ed.2d 659. We think the Government has met this burden. In 1951 when the plaintiff went abroad it was for a limited period. On December 29, 1952, he accepted a position at the Harvard Medical School to begin the latter part of 1953, and indicated that he had made arrangements for prior transportation to the United States. His intention to return to this country was steadfast until he learned shortly after January 31, 1953, that the school authorities felt that they could not declare him 'essential' for teaching, and that he probably would be drafted. He wrote them on February 10, 1953, that until he heard 'something definite' from the draft borad he was 'reluctant to take a decision that may prove to be foolish or premature.' On February 9, June 4, and July 3 in 1953 the draft board sent him notices to report for physical examination, and thereafter ordered him to report for induction on September 14, 1953. The plaintiff made no response or compliance but remained abroad. We are convinced that his purpose was to avoid service in the armed forces.\n'The only question left in this case is the constitutionality of the law under which the Government maintains that the plaintiff was divested of his citizenship.' 187 F.Supp., at 686.\n\n\n2\n Cort was not charged with going abroad in order to avoid military service, but solely with remaining abroad to avoid induction. The evidence shows convincingly that Cort's purpose in remaining abroad, first in England and then in Czechoslovakia, was to avoid the draft.\nOn May 29, 1951, Cort left the United States to accept a research fellowship at the University of Cambridge, England. A few days before his departure he registered as a 'special registrant' under the Doctors Draft Act. On September 11, 1952, he was classified I\u2014A (medical), available for military service. Meanwhile, in late 1951 the Government had requested Cort to surrender his passport for invalidation, except for return to the United States. He did not do this.\nOn December 29, 1952, Cort accepted, by a letter sent from England, a teaching position at the Harvard Medical School, indicating his intention to return to the United States in late June 1953 in order to start work on August 1, 1953. On the same day he also wrote to the Massachusetts Medical Advisory Committee, stating that he would begin teaching at Harvard in July 1953, and requesting a draft deferment on the ground that this 'civilian function * * * shall be far more essential to my country than military service.'\nOn January 29, 1953, Harvard authorities advised the Medical Advisory Committee that they did not regard Cort's teaching position as essential to medical teaching, and on February 4, 1953, the Committee recommended to the local draft board that Cort be considered\n'available for active military service.' Between January 31, 1953, and May 29, 1953, the Dean of the Harvard Medical School and Cort exchanged several letters\u2014the Dean suggesting that Cort apply for a commission, Cort expressing surprise that the teaching position was not considered essential, and that until he had heard from his draft board he was 'reluctant to take a decision that may prove to be foolish or premature.'\nOn February 9, 1953, Cort was informed by his local draft board that his deferment request had been denied, and he was ordered to report for a physical examination within 30 days of the receipt of the letter. On June 4, 1953, and on July 3, 1953, he was again sent notices directing him to report for a physical examination. On August 13, 1953, Cort was ordered to report for induction on September 14, 1953. Cort did not report notwithstanding that in the interval, as he concedes, he had received these notices from his draft board.\nOn August 8, 1954, after his residence permit in England was not renewed by the British Home Office, Cort took up residence in Prague, Czechoslovakia, where not until April 7, 1959, did he make any application for a United States passport.\nAgainst this background the District Court was certainly entitled to discredit Cort's belated efforts, long after his indictment for draft evasion, to come to terms with the military authorities, as well as his self-serving statements that he remained abroad to avoid investigation as to his alleged Communist affilations or possible prosecution under the Smith Act.\n\n\n3\n A presumption that one is remaining abroad with a purpose of avoiding military service, arising from continued sojourn abroad in the face of an uncontroverted call to military duty, certainly bears no resemblance whatever to the presumption found wanting in Tot. That presumption was that firearms or ammunition possessed by one previously convicted of a crime of violence, or who was a fugitive from justice, were received not only in interstate commerce, but also subsequent to the enactment of the relevant statute, the presumption arising solely from a showing that such person had already once been convicted of a crime of violence and was presently in possession of firearms or ammunition.\n\n\n4\n Even on the premises of my Brother STEWART, the proper course would be to remand the Cort case to the District Court for a new trial, not, as he proposes, to set aside the basic denationalization proceeding. This is not a case of the District Court being called on simply to review for error an administrative record, but one in which it was required to try the denationalization issue de novo. In these circumstances there would be no need to have the administrative proceeding start all over again.\n\n\n1\n The statute involved in No. 2, Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, is \u00a7 401(j) of the Nationality Act of 1940, as amended, 58 Stat. 746. The statute involved in No. 3, Rusk v. Cort, is \u00a7 349(a)(10) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481(a)(10). The substantive provisions of these statutes are practically identical. I agree with the Court that the jurisdictional objection and the claims of collateral estoppel in No. 2 are without merit, and that the constitutional validity of both statutes must therefore be determined.\n\n\n2\n 356 U.S., at 62, 78 S.Ct., at 578 (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n3\n In Perez v. Brownell, the Court pointed out that the provision of the Fourteenth Amendment that 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States * * *' does not restrict the power of Congress to enact denaturalization legislation. It was there stated that 'there is nothing in the terms, the context, the history or the manifest purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment to warrant drawing from it a restriction upon the power otherwise possessed by Congress to withdraw citizenship.' 356 U.S., at 58, n. 3, 78 S.Ct., at 576.\n\n\n4\n Act of March 3, 1865, \u00a7 21, 13 Stat. 490.\n\n\n5\n This law was the direct predecessor of \u00a7 401(g) of the Nationality Act of 1940, providing the additional penalty of loss of citizenship upon those convicted by court-martial of deserting the armed forces in time of war (a provision subsequently invalidated in Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 596).\n\n\n6\n 356 U.S. 44, 78 S.Ct. 568, 2 L.Ed.2d 603 (involving \u00a7 401(e)).\n\n\n7\n 356 U.S. 86, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 596 (involving \u00a7 401(g)).\n\n\n8\n See Perez v.

The Department of Justice discovered that in the western district of Texas, in the vicinity of El Paso alone, there were over 800 draft delinquents recorded in the local Federal Bureau of Investigation office, born in this country and, therefore citizens, who had crossed the border into Mexico for the purpose of evading the draft, but with the expectation of returning to the United States to resume residence after the war.' H.R.Rep.No.1229, 78th Cong., 2d Sess. 1\u20142. In explaining the bill to the House Committee of the Whole, Representative Dickstein, the Chairman of the House Committee on Immigration, stated: 'I would classify this piece of legislation as a bill to denaturalize and denationalize all draft dodgers who left this country knowing that there was a possibility that they might be drafted in this war and that they might have to serve in the armed forces, in the naval forces, or the marines, and in an effort to get out of such service. We are all American citizens and our country has a great stake in this war; nevertheless, we have found hundreds of men who have left this country to go to certain parts of Mexico and other South American countries with the idea of evading military service and of returning after the war is over, and taking their old places in our society.' 90 Cong.Rec. 3261.\nIn explaining the bill to the Senate, Senator Russell, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Immigration, stated: 'The * * * bill * * * relates to the class of persons, whether citizens of the United States or aliens, who departed from the United States in order to avoid service in the armed forces of the United States under the Selective Service Act. Information before the committee indicated that on one day several hundred persons departed from the United States through the city of El Paso, Tex., alone, in order to avoid service in either the Army or the Navy of the United States, and to avoid selection under the selective-service law. This bill provides that any person who is a national of the United States, or an American citizen, and who in time of national stress departed from the United States to another country to avoid serving his country, shall be deprived of his nationality.\n'It further provides that any alien who is subject to military service under the terms of the Selective Service Act, and who left this country to avoid military service, shall thereafter be forever barred from admission to the United States.\n'Mr. President, I do not see how anyone could object to such a bill. An alien who remains in the country and refuses to serve in the armed forces in time of war is prosecuted under our laws, and if found guilty he is compelled to serve a term in the penitentiary. Under the terms of the Selective Service Act an American citizen who refuses to serve when he is called upon to do so is likewise subject to a prison term. Certainly those who, having enjoyed the advantages of living in the United States, were unwilling to serve their country or subject themselves to the Selective Service Act, should be penalized in some measure. This bill would deprive such persons as are citizens of the United States of their citizenship, and, in the case of aliens, would forever bar them from admission into the United States. Any American citizen who is convicted of violating the Selective Service Act loses his citizenship. This bill would merely impose a similar penalty on those who are not subject to the jurisdiction of our courts, the penalty being the same as would result in the case of those who are subject to the jurisdiction of our courts.' 90 Cong.Rec. 7628\u20147629.\n\n\n11\n Section 349(a)(10) did add a presumption that failure to comply with any provision of the compulsory service laws of the United States means that the departure from or absence from the United States is for the purpose of avoiding military service. See pp. 215\u2014219.\n\n\n12\n Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S., at 94, 78 S.Ct., at 594.\n\n\n13\n I cannot suppose that the Court today is saying that Congress can impose denationalization without the safeguards of a criminal trial for conduct which is unexceptionable\u2014like marrying an alien\u2014or relatively innocuous\u2014like voting in a foreign election but that Congress cannot do so for conduct which is reprehensible.\n\n\n14\n See III Moore, Digest of International Law (1906), \u00a7\u00a7 434, 436\u2014438, 440; Tsiang, The Question of Expatriation in America Prior to 1907 (1942), 44\u201455, 71\u201472, 78\u201484.\n\n\n15\n 'The Congress shall have Power * * *\n'To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water;\n'To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years;\n'To provide and maintain a Navy;\n'To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces;\n'To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.'

{"text":"394 U.S. 324\n89 S.Ct. 1095\n22 L.Ed.2d 311\nReyes Arias OROZCO, Petitioner,v.TEXAS.\nNo. 641.\nArgued Feb. 26, 1969.\nDecided March 25, 1969.\n\nCharles W. Tessmer, Dallas, Tex., for petitioner.\nLonny F. Zwiener, Austin, Tex., for respondent.\nMr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe petitioner, Reyes Arias Orozco, was convicted in the Criminal District Court of Dallas County, Texas, of murder without malice and was sentenced to serve in the state prison not less than two nor more than 10 years. The Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas affirmed the conviction, rejecting petitioner's contention that a material part of the evidence against him was obtained in violation of the provision of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, that: 'No person * * * shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.'1\n\n\n2\nThe evidence introduced at trial showed that petitioner and the deceased had quarreled outside the El Farleto Cafe in Dallas shortly before midnight on the date of the shooting. The deceased had apparently spoken to petitioner's female companion inside the restaurant. In the heat of the quarrel outside, the deceased is said to have beaten petitioner about the face and called him 'Mexican Grease.' A shot was fired killing the deceased. Petitioner left the scene and returned to his boardinghouse to sleep. At about 4 a.m. four police officers arrived at petitioner's boardinghouse, were admitted by an unidentified woman, and were told that petitioner was asleep in the bedroom. All four officers entered the bedroom and began to question petitioner. From the moment he gave his name, according to the testimony of one of the officers, petitioner was not free to go where he pleased but was 'under arrest.' The officers asked him if he had been to the El Farleto restaurant that night and when he answered 'yes' he was asked if he owned a pistol. Petitioner admitted owning one. After being asked a second time where the pistol was located, he admitted that it was in the washing machine in a backroom of the boardinghouse. Ballistics tests indicated that the gun found in the washing machine was the gun that fired the fatal shot. At petitioner's trial, held after the effective date2 of this Court's decision in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974 (1966), the trial court allowed one of the officers, over the objection of petitioner's lawyer,3 to relate the statements made by petitioner concerning the gun and petitioner's presence at the scene of the shooting. The trial testimony clearly shows that the officers questioned petitioner about incriminating facts without first informing him of his right to remain silent, his right to have the advice of a lawyer before making any statement, and his right to have a lawyer appointed to assist him if he could not afford to hire one. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held, with one judge dissenting, that the admission of testimony concerning the statements petitioner had made without the above warnings was not precluded by Miranda. We disagree and hold that the use of these admissions obtained in the absence of the required warnings was a flat violation of the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment as construed in Miranda.\n\n\n3\nThe State has argued here that since petitioner was interrogated on his own bed, in familiar surroundings, our Miranda holding should not apply. It is true that the Court did say in Miranda that 'compulsion to speak in the isolated setting of the police station may well be greater than in courts or other official investigations, where there are often impartial observers to guard against intimidation or trickery.' 384 U.S., at 461, 86 S.Ct., at 1621. But the opinion iterated and reiterated the absolute necessity for officers interrogating people 'in custody' to give the described warnings. See Mathis v. United States, 391 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1503, 20 L.Ed.2d 381 (1968). According to the officer's testimony, petitioner was under arrest and not free to leave when he was questioned in his bedroom in the early hours of the morning. The Miranda opinion declared that the warnings were required when the person being interrogated was 'in custody at the station or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.' 384 U.S., at 477, 86 S.Ct., at 1629. (Emphasis supplied.) The decision of this Court in Miranda was reached after careful consideration and lengthy opinions were announced by both the majority and dissenting Justices. There is no need to canvass those arguments again. We do not, as the dissent implies, expand or extend to the slightest extent our Miranda decision. We do adhere to our well-considered holding in that case and therefore reverse4 the conviction below.\n\n\n4\nReversed.\n\n\n5\nMr. Justice FORTAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n6\nMr. Justice HARLAN, concurring.\n\n\n7\nThe passage of time has not made the Miranda case any more palatable to me than it was when the case was decided. See my dissenting opinion, and that of Mr. Justice White, in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 504, 526, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974 (1966).\n\n\n8\nYet, despite my strong inclination to join in the dissent of my Brother WHITE, Ican find no acceptable avenue of escape from Miranda in judging this case, especially in light of Mathis v. United States, 391 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1503, 20 L.Ed.2d 381 (1968), which has already extended the Miranda rules beyond the police station, over the protest of Justices Stewart, White, and myself, id., at 5\u20148, 88 S.Ct. 1503. Therefore, and purely out of respect for stare decisis, I reluctantly feel compelled to acquiesce in today's decision of the Court, at the same time observing that the constitutional condemnation of this perfectly understandable, sensible, proper, and indeed commendable piece of police work highlights the unsoundness of Miranda.\n\n\n9\nMr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART joins, dissenting.\n\n\n10\nThis decision carries the rule of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974 (1966), to a new and unwarranted extreme. I continue to believe that the original rule amounted to a 'constitutional straitjacket' on law enforcement which was justified neither by the words or history of the Constitution, nor by any reasonable view of the likely benefits of the rule as against its disadvant ges. 384 U.S., at 526, 86 S.Ct. 1602. Even accepting Miranda, the Court extends the rule here and draws the straitjacket even tighter.\n\n\n11\nThe opinion of the Court in Miranda was devoted in large part to an elaborate discussion of the subtle forms of psychological pressure which could be brought to bear when an accused person is interrogated at length in unfamiliar surroundings. The 'salient features' of the cases decided in Miranda were 'incommunicado interrogation of individuals in a police-dominated atmosphere.' 384 U.S., at 445, 86 S.Ct. at 1612. The danger was that in such circumstances the confidence of the prisoner could be eroded by techniques such as successive interrogations by police acting out friendly or unfriendly roles. These techniques are best developed in 'isolation and unfamiliar surroundings,' 384 U.S., at 450, 86 S.Ct. at 1615. And they take time: 'the major qualities an interrogator should possess are patience and perserverance.' Ibid. The techniques of an extended period of isolation, repeated interrogation, cajolery, and trickery often enough produced admissions which were actually coerced in the traditional sense so that new safeguards were deemed essential.\n\n\n12\nIt is difficult to believe that the requirements there laid down were essential to prevent compulsion in every conceivable case of station house interrogation. Where the defendant himself as a lawyer, policeman, professional criminal, or otherwise has become aware of what his right to silence is, it is sheer fancy to assert that his answer to every question asked him is compelled unless he is advised of those rights with which he is already intimately familiar. If there is any warrant to Miranda at all, it rests on the likelihood that in a sufficient number of cases exposure to station house practices will result in compelled confessions and that additional safeguards should be imposed in all cases to prevent possible erosion of Fifth Amendment values. Hence, the detailed ritual which Miranda fashioned.\n\n\n13\nThe Court now extends the same rules to all instances of in-custody questioning outside the station house. Once arrest occurs, the application of Miranda is automatic. The rule is simple but it ignores the purpose of Miranda to guard against what was thought to be the corrosive influenct of practices which station house interrogation makes feasible. The Court wholly ignores the guestion whether similar hazards exist or even are possible when police arrest and interrogate on the spot, whether it be on the street corner or in the home, as in this case. No predicate is laid for believing that practices outside the station house are normally prolonged, carried out in isolation, or often productive of the physical or psychological coercion made so much of in Miranda. It is difficult to imagine the police duplicating in a person's home or on the street those conditions and practices which the Court found prevalent in the station house and which were thought so threatening to the right to silence. Without such a demonstration. Miranda hardly reaches this case or any cases similar to it.\n\n\n14\nHere, there was no prolonged interrogation, no unfamiliar surroundings, no opportunity for the police to invoke those procedures which moved the majority in Miranda. In fact, the conversation was by all accounts a very brief one. According to uncontradicted testimony, petitioner was awake when the officers entered his room, and they asked him four questions: his name, whether he had been at the El Farleto, whether he owned a pistol, and where it was. He gave his name, said he had been at the El Farleto, and admitted he owned a pistol without hesitation. He was slow in telling where the pistol was, and the question was repeated. He then took the police to the nearby washing machine where the gun was hidden.\n\n\n15\nIt is unquestioned that this sequence of events in their totality would not constitute coercion in the traditional sense or lead any court to view the admissions as involuntary within the meaning of the rules by which we even now adjudicate claims of coercion relating to pre-Miranda trials. And, realistically, had Orozco refused to answer the questions asked of him, it seems most unlikely that prolonged interrogation would have followed in petitioner's own quarters; nothing similar to the station house model invoked by the court would have occurred here. The police had petitioner's name and description, had ample evidence that he had been at the night club and suspected that he had a gun. Surely had he refused to give his name or answer any other questions, they would have arrested him anyway, searched the house and found the gun, which would have been clearly admissible under all relevant authorities. But the Court insists that this case be reversed for failure to give Miranda warnings.\n\n\n16\nI cannot accept the dilution of the custody requirements of Miranda to this level, where the hazards to the right to silence are so equivocal and unsupported by experience in a recurring number of cases. Orozco was apprehended in the most familiar quarters, the questioning was brief, and no admissions were made which were not backed up by other evidence. This case does not involve the confession of an innocent man, or even of a guilty man from whom a confession has been wrung by physical abuse or the modern psychological methods discussed in Miranda. These are simply the terse remarks of a man who has been caught, almost in the act. Even if there were reason to encourage suspects to consult lawyers to tell them to be silent before quizzing at the station house, there is no reason why police in the field should have to preface every casual question of a suspect with the full panoply of Miranda warnings. The same danger of coercion is simply not present in such circumstances, and the answers to the questions may as often clear a suspect as help convict him. If the Miranda warnings have their intended effect, and the police are able to get no answers from suspects, innocent or guilty, without arresting them, then a great many more innocent men will be making unnecessary trips to the station house. Ultimately it may be necessary to arrest a man, bring him to the police station, and provide a lawyer, just to discover his name. Even if the man is innocent the process will be an unpleasant one.\n\n\n17\nSince the Court's extension of Miranda's rule takes it into territory where even what rationale there original was disappears, I dissent.\n\n\n18\nMemorandum of Mr. Justice STEWART.\n\n\n19\nAlthough there is much to be said for Mr. Justice HARLAN'S position, I join my Brother WHITE in dissent. It seems to me that those of us who dissented in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974, remain free not only to express our continuing disagreement with that decision, but also to oppose any broadening of its impact.\n\n\n\n1\n The state court also rejected a contention that use of the evidence also violated the Fourth Amendment's provision against unreasonable searches and seizures. Our holding makes it unnecessary for us to consider that contention.\n\n\n2\n See Jo nson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966).\n\n\n3\n The State appears to urge that petitioner's Miranda claim is unreviewable in this Court because the objection made by trial counsel to the officer's testimony was not sufficiently 'specific.' We fail to perceive how this could be an adequate state ground in view of the fact that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals specifically decided that the introduction of petitioner's statement made to the officers 'was not precluded under Miranda v. State of Arizona,' 428 S.W.2d 666, 672, while the dissenting judge thought that it was.\n\n\n4\n In light of some apparent misunderstanding on this point, it is perhaps appropriate to point out once again that a reversal by this Court of a conviction based in part on unconstitutional evidence leaves the State free to retry the defendant without the tainted evidence.\n\n\n","label":0}

Thereafter the Government amended its complaint so as to join the State of Alabama as a party defendant.\n\n\n2\nThe District Court dismissed the complaint as to all defendants. It held (1) that the individual respondents had been sued only as Registrars, and that having under Alabama law effectively resigned their offices they were not suable in their official capacities; (2) that the Board of Registrars was not a suable legal entity; and (3) that the Civil Rights Act of 1957 did not authorize this action against the State. 171 F.Supp. 720.

{"text":"377 U.S. 463\n84 S.Ct. 1587\n12 L.Ed.2d 448\nUNITED STATES, Appellant,v.Rocco TATEO.\nNo. 328.\nArgued April 20, 1964.\nDecided June 8, 1964.\n\nMiss Beatrice Rosenberg, Washington, D.C., for appellant.\nRobert Kasanof, New York City, for appellee.\nMr. Justice HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis case presents the question whether a federal criminal defendant who has had his conviction overturned in collateral proceedings on the ground that a guilty plea entered by him during trial was not voluntary but induced in part by comments of the trial judge, may be tried again for the same crimes or is protected against such prosecution by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. We hold that under these circumstances retrial does not infringe the constitutional protection against double jeopardy.\n\n\n2\nOn May 15, 1956, the appellee, Tateo, and another were brought to trial before a jury on a five-count indictment charging bank robbery (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a)); kidnaping in connection with the robbery (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(e)); taking and carrying away bank money (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b)); receiving and possessing stolen bank money (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(c)); and conspiracy (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371) to commit some of these substantive offenses. On the fourth day of trial, the judge informed Tateo's counsel that if Tateo were found guilty by the jury he would impose a life sentence on the kidnaping charge and consecutive sentences on the other charges. Upon being told of the judge's position and advised by his counsel that the likelihood of conviction was great, Tateo pleaded guilty, as did his codefendant. Thereupon the jury was discharged; the kidnaping count was dismissed with the prosecution's consent; and Tateo was sentenced to a total of 22 years and 6 months imprisonment on the other counts.\n\n\n3\nIn a later proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, another district judge (Judge Weinfeld) granted Tateo's motion to set aside the judgment of conviction and for a new trial, determining that the cumulative impact of the trial testimony, the trial judge's expressed views on punishment, and the strong advice given by his counsel rendered it doubtful that Tateo possessed the freedom of will necessary for a voluntary plea of guilty. D.C., 214 F.Supp. 560.\n\n\n4\nAfter being reindicted on the kidnaping charge, Tateo was brought before a third district judge (Judge Tyler) for trial on that charge and the four bank robbery charges to which he had earlier pleaded guilty. Upon motions by the defense, Judge Tyler dismissed both the kidnaping count, now abandoned by the Government, and the other four counts. He reasoned that, since neither genuine consent nor an 'exceptional circumstance' underlay the termination of the first trial and no 'waiver' of the double jeopardy claim had been made by Tateo, the Government was precluded from retrying him. 216 F.Supp. 850. The Government appealed, in accord with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731, which permits direct appeal to this Court from a decision of a District Court sustaining a motion in bar before the defendant has been put in jeopardy. We noted probable jurisdiction, 375 U.S. 877, 84 S.Ct. 148, 11 L.Ed.2d 109. For reasons given below, we reverse the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n5\nThe Fifth Amendment provides that no 'person (shall) be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb * * *.' The principle that this provision does not preclude the Government's retrying a defendant whose conviction is set aside because of an error in the proceedings leading to conviction is a well-established part of our constitutional jurisprudence. In this respect we differ from the practice obtaining in England. The rule in this country was explicitly stated in United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662, 671\u2014672, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 1195, 41 L.Ed. 300, a case in which defendants were reindicted after this Court had found the original indictment to be defective. It has been followed in a variety of circumstances; see, e.g., Stroud v. United States, 251 U.S. 15, 40 S.Ct. 50, 64 L.Ed. 103, (after conviction reversed because of confession of error); Bryan v. United States, 338 U.S. 552, 70 S.Ct. 317, 94 L.Ed. 335 (after conviction reversed because of insufficient evidence); Forman v. United States, 361 U.S. 416, 80 S.Ct. 481, 4 L.Ed.2d 412 (after original conviction reversed for error in instructions to the jury).1\n\n\n6\nThat a defendant's conviction is overturned on collateral rather than direct attack is irrelevant for these purposes, see Robinson v. United States, 144 F.2d 392, 396, 397, aff'd on another ground, 324 U.S. 282, 65 S.Ct. 666, 89 L.Ed. 944. Courts are empowered to grant new trials under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and it would be incongruous to compel greater relief for one who proceeds collaterally than for one whose rights are vindicated on direct review.\n\n\n7\nWhile different theories have been advanced to support the permissibility of retrial, of greater importance than the conceptual abstractions employed to explain the Ball principle are the implications of that principle for the sound administration of Justice. Corresponding to the right of an accused to be given a fair trial is the societal interest in punishing one whose guilt is clear after he was obtained such a trial. It would be a high price indeed for society to pay were every accused granted immunity from punishment because of any defect sufficient to constitute reversible error in the proceedings leading to conviction. From the standpoint of a defendant, it is at least doubtful that appellate courts would be as zealous as they now are in protecting against the effects of improprieties at the trial or pretrial stage if they knew that reversal of a conviction would put the accused irrevocably beyond the reach of further prosecution. In reality, therefore, the practice of retrial serves defendants' rights as well as society's interest. The underlying purpose of permitting retrial is as much furthered by application of the rule to this case as it has been in cases previously decided.\n\n\n8\nTateo contends that his situation must be distinguished from one in which an accused has been found guilty by a jury, since his involuntary plea of guilty deprived him of the opportunity to obtain a jury verdict of acquittal. We find this argument unconvincing. If a case is reversed because of a coerced confession improperly admitted, a deficiency in the indictment, or an improper instruction, it is presumed that the accused did not have his case fairly put to the jury. A defendant is no less wronged by a jury finding of guilt after an unfair trial than by a failure to get a jury verdict at all; the distinction between the two kinds of wrongs affords no sensible basis for differentiation with regard to retrial.2 Appellee's argument is considerably less strong than a similar one rejected in Bryan v. United States, supra. In that case the Court held that despite the Court of Appeals' determination that defendant had been entitled\u2014because of insufficiency in the evidence\u2014to a directed verdict of acquittal, reversal of the conviction with a direction of a new trial was a permissible disposition.\n\n\n9\nDownum v. United States, 372 U.S. 734, 83 S.Ct. 1033, 10 L.Ed.2d 100, is in no way inconsistent with permitting a retrial here. There the Court held that when a jury is discharged because the prosecution is not ready to go forward with its case, the accused may not then be tried before another jury. The opinion recognized, however, that there are circumstances in which a mistrial does not preclude a second trial, see, e.g., United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 6 L.Ed. 165 (jury unable to agree); Simmons v. United States, 142 U.S. 148, 12 S.Ct. 171, 35 L.Ed. 968 (likelihood that a juror subject to bias). In Gori v. United States, 367 U.S. 364, 81 S.Ct. 1523; 6 L.Ed.2d 901, we sustained a second conviction after the original trial judge declared a mistrial on the ground of possible prejudice to the defendant, although the judge acted without defendant's consent and the wisdom of granting a mistrial was doubtful. If Tateo had requested a mistrial on the basis of the judge's comments, there would be no doub  that if he had been successful, the Government would not have been barred from retrying him. See Gori v. United States, 367 U.S., at 368, 81 S.Ct. at 1526; see also 367 U.S. at 370, 81 S.Ct. at 1527 (dissenting opinion of DOUGLAS, J.).3 Although there may be good reasons why Tateo and his counsel chose not to make such a motion before the trial judge, it would be strange were Tateo to benefit because of his delay in challenging the judge's conduct.4\n\n\n10\nWe conclude that this case falls squarely within the reasoning of Ball and subsequent cases allowing the Government to retry persons whose convictions have been overturned. The judgment below is therefore reversed and the case remanded to the District Court with instructions to reinstate the four bank robbery counts.\n\n\n11\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n12\nJudgment reversed and case remanded to the District Court with instructions.\n\n\n13\nMr. Justice GOLDBERG, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS join, dissenting.\n\n\n14\nI would affirm the District Court's holding, 216 F.Supp. 850, that under our decision last term in Downum v. United States, 372 U.S. 734, 83 S.Ct. 1033, 10 L.Ed.2d 100, the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment protects Tateo against reprosecution. The Court today departs from Downum and in so doing substantially weakens the constitutional guarantee. Downum was correctly decided and deserves a life longer than that accorded it by the decision today. Rather than making any real effort to distinguish Downum, the Court limits it to its particular facts and reaffirms, indeed extends, the doubtful holding of the narrow majority in Gori v. United States, 367 U.S. 364, 81 S.Ct. 1523, 6 L.Ed.2d 9011\u2014a holding which, in my view, departs from Downum's more hospitable attitude toward the 'policy of the Bill of Rights * * * to make rare indeed the occasions when the citizen can for the same offense be required to run the gantlet twice.' Gori v. United States, supra, 367 U.S. at 373, 81 S.Ct. at 1528 (Douglas, J., dissenting).2 A comparison of the facts and rationale of Downum with those here reveals that this case calls more loudly than Downum for protection against double jeopardy.\n\n\n15\nIn Downum, on the morning th  case was called for trial both sides announced ready. A jury was selected, sworn, and instructed to return at 2 p.m. When it returned the prosecution asked that the jury be discharged because its key witness on two counts of the indictment was not present\u2014a fact discovered by the prosecutor only during the noon recess. It was not contended that the failure to secure the attendance of this witness was in any way deliberate or based upon the prosecutor's conclusion that the impaneled jury was likely to acquit. Instead, the 'jury first selected to try petitioner and sworn was discharged because a prosecution witness had not been served with a summons and because no other arrangements had been made to assure his presence.' Downum v. United States, supra, 372 U.S. at 737, 83 S.Ct. at 1035. In sustaining the claim of double jeopardy as to a retrial commenced two days later, this Court said:\n\n\n16\n'At times the valued right of a defendant to have his trial      completed by the particular tribunal summoned to sit in      judgment on him may be subordinated to the public interest      when there is an imperious necessity to do so. Wade v.      Hunter, supra, 336 U.S. (684), 690, (69 S.Ct. (834), 837\u2014838,      93 L.Ed. 974). Differences have arisen so as to the      application of the principle. See Brock v. North Carolina,      344 U.S. 424 (73 S.Ct. 349, 97 L.Ed. 456); Green v. United      States, 355 U.S. 184, 188 (78 S.Ct. 221, 223\u2014224, 2 L.Ed.2d      199). Harassment of an accused by successive prosecutions or      declaration of a mistrial so as to afford the prosecution a      more favorable opportunity to convict are examples when      jeopardy attaches. Gori v. United States, supra, 367 U.S. 369      (81 S.Ct. 1526\u20141527, 6 L.Ed.2d 901). But those extreme cases      do not mark the limits of the guarantee. The discretion to      discharge the jury before it has reached a verdict is to be      exercised 'only in very extraordinary and striking      circumstances,' to use the words of Mr. Justice Story in      United States v. Coolidge, 25 Fed.Cas. 622, 623. For the      prohibition of the Double Jeopardy Clause is 'not against      being twice punished, but against being twice put in      jeopardy.' United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662, 669 (16 S.Ct.      1192, 1194, 41 L.Ed. 300).' Id., 372 U.S. at 736, 83 S.Ct. at      1034.\n\nThe Court further said:\n\n17\n'We resolve any doubt 'in favor of the liberty of the      citizen, rather than exercise what would be an unlimited,      uncertain, and arbitrary judicial discretion.\" Id., 372 U.S.      at 738, 83 S.Ct. at 1035.\n\n\n18\nThe Court thus held that Downum could not be reprosecuted, since, by virtue of prosecutorial neglect, he was denied his constitutional right to have the impaneled jury hear and decide his case.\n\n\n19\nIn the present case, after four days of trial, the trial judge, as he put it at the time of sentencing, told defendant's counsel:\n\n\n20\n'* * * (If he is convicted) by the jury I (intend) to give      (him) the absolute maximum sentence, a life sentence plus all      of these years to follow the life sentence.\n\n\n21\n'If anybody wonders how one can serve a sentence after he has      served a life sentence, it is very simple, because in a life      sentence you are eligible for parole in fifteen years; but      with a sentence to follow a life sentence, you are not      eligible for parole on the life sentence, and you have to      stay in jail for the rest of your life.'\n\n\n22\nAs a result of this coercion by the trial judge, Tateo entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment for 22 years and 6 months.\n\n\n23\nAfter Tateo served almost seven years in prison, District Judge Weinfeld granted his motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate the conviction. Judge Weinfeld found that:\n\n\n24\n'The choice open to this defendant when appraised during the      trial of the Court's statement was rather severely limited.      If, as was his constitutional right, he continued with the      trial and were found guilty, he faced, in the light of the      Court's announced attitude, the imposition of a life sentence      upon the kidnapping charge, plus additional time upon the      other counts, a sentence which  is lawyer informed him and      which he believed, not without reason, meant life      imprisonment.' 214 F.Supp., at 565\u2014566.\n\n\n25\n'No matter how heinous the offense charged, how           overwhelming the proof of guilt may appear, or how           hopeless the defense, a defendant's right to continue           with his trial may not be violated. His constitutional           right to require the Government to proceed to a           conclusion of the trial and to establish guilt by           independent evidence should not be exercised under the           shadow of a penalty\u2014that if he persists in the assertion           of his right and is found guilty, he faces, in view of           the Trial Court's announced intention, a maximum           sentence, and if he pleads guilty, there is the prospect           of a substantially reduced term.' 214 F.Supp. at 567.\n\n\n26\n'The realities of human nature and common experience compel      the conclusion that the defendant was enveloped by a coercive      force resulting from the knowledge conveyed to him of the      Court's attitude as to sentence which, under all the      circumstances, foreclosed a reasoned choice by him at the      time he entered his plea of guilty.' 214 F.Supp. at 568.\n\n\n27\nTateo was thereupon re-indicted by the Government and brought before Judge Tyler for retrial. Judge Tyler sustained defense motions to dismiss the indictment and ordered Tateo discharged from prison just one month short of seven years after the original sentence.\n\n\n28\nJudge Tyler found that Tateo 'was coerced from availing himself of his Fifth Amendment right to go to the original jury for its verdict of guilt or innocence.' 216 F.Supp., at 853. Applying Downum, Judge Tyler held that '(s) ince neither constitutionally sound consent nor an 'exceptional circumstance' underpinned the termination here, a second trial is constitutionally impermissible.' 216 F.Supp. at 852.\n\n\n29\nThe Government does not, and indeed cannot, challenge Judge Weinfeld's and Judge Tyler's conclusion that Tateo's guilty plea was coerced by the trial judge. Nor can it be contended that the injury to Tateo was less substantial than the injury to Downum. Each was deprived of his 'valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal,' Wade v. Hunter, 336 U.S. 684, 689, 69 S.Ct. 834, 837, 93 L.Ed. 974; Downum by reason of prosecutorial oversight or neglect; Tateo by reason of the trial judge's threat to impose a sentence that would make him 'stay in jail for the rest of (his) life.' If anything, Tateo's deprivation is more serious. The purpose of the judicial coercion in his case was to deny him the right to have the impaneled jury decide his fate, whereas this was merely the effect of the prosecutorial negligence in Downum. Moreover, Downum was not subjected to the taking of evidence, whereas Tateo's trial had been in progress for four days before its abortive ending.\n\n\n30\nThe reasons advanced by the Court to support its holding are similar to the arguments presented by the Government and, in effect, rejected by the Court in Downum. The Court suggests, as the Government unsuccessfully argued in Downum, that if such double jeopardy pleas are sustained then, logically, reprosecution would have to be barred in any case where error is committed at the trial. Under the decisions of this Court, however, this is a non sequitur. In this country, contrary to English practice, a defendant may be retried after reversal because of errors at the trial\u2014including errors in instructions, in rulings on the evidence, in admitting confessions, or in permitting prejudicial comments or conduct by the prosecutor.3 But, in such instances, the realities are that, notwithstanding the errors, the defendant has had a jury trial, albeit not the error-free jury trial to which by law he is entitled. Tateo, however, was deprived of his valued right to have the original jury consider his case at all. Wade v. Hunter, supra. Any experienced trial lawyer aware of the realities of jury trials will recognize the difference between the two cases. Many juries acquit defendants after trials in which reve sible error has been committed, and many experienced trial lawyers will forego a motion for a mistrial in favor of having his case decided by the jury.\n\n\n31\nThe Court says further that '(i)f Tateo had requested a mistrial on the basis of the judge's comments, there would be no doubt that if he had been successful, the Government would not have been barred from retrying him.' Ante, at 467. This completely overlooks Judge Weinfeld's unchallenged finding that Tateo was so 'enveloped by (the) coercive force' of the trial judge's threat that he had no choice but to plead guilty. 214 F.Supp., at 568. To hypothesize the results of a defense request for a mistrial under these circumstances obscures the issue. Here it was the trial judge, not the defendant, who took the case away from the jury by coercing the guilty plea.\n\n\n32\nThe Court also intimates that if Tateo's plea of double jeopardy is accepted then, logically, it will be necessary to bar reprosecutions under the Double Jeopardy Clause of persons whose guilty pleas made before the jury is sworn, are ultimately found to be coerced. But again, under this Court's decisions, this does not follow. By settled interpretation the protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause does not attach before a jury is impaneled and sworn, or in a nonjury trial, before the court has begun to hear evidence.4 Thus, the application of the double jeopardy guarantee to Tateo's case, where the plea was coerced after four days of trial, will in no way impair the settled interpretation.\n\n\n33\nIt is also suggested that Tateo could have proceeded to verdict and appealed the sentence. The reply to this by his counsel in this Court seems to me unanswerable: 'But it would be an audacious trial lawyer indeed who would advise a client in a Federal Court to risk a life in prison without hope of parole on the basis of an appellate review of his sentence, for there is no power to review a sentence within the statutory maximum either in the Supreme Court (Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386, 393, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405) or in the Court of Appeals (Pependrea v. United States, 275 F.2d 325, 329 (C.A.9)).'5\n\n\n34\nThe Court's final point is that its decision is necessary to protect 'the societal interest in punishing one whose guilt is clear'\u2014an interest which the Court here prefers to the right of an accused not to be subjected to double jeopardy. Ante, at 466. With all deference, I suggest that the Constitution has resolved this question of competing interests of the Government and the individual in favor of protecting the individual from the harassment and danger of reprosecution. I agree with my Brother DOUGLAS dissenting in Gori v. United States, 367 U.S., at 373, 81 S.Ct. at 1528 that: 'The question is not * * * whether a defendant is 'to receive absolution for his crime.' * * * The policy of the Bill of Rights is to make rare indeed the occasions when the citizen can for the same offense be required to run the gantlet twice. The risk of judicial arbitrariness rests where, in my view, the Constitution puts it\u2014on the Government.' As in Downum I would 'resolve any doubt 'in favor of the liberty of the citizen.\"\n\n\n35\nFor these reasons, I dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199, does not undermine this settled practice; it holds only that when one is convicted of a lesser offense included in that charged in the original indictment, he can be retried only for the offense of which he was con icted rather than that with which he was originally charged.\n\n\n2\n It is also difficult to understand why Tateo should be treated differently from one who is coerced into pleading guilty before a jury is impaneled.\n\n\n3\n If there were any intimation in a case that prosecutorial or judicial impropriety justifying a mistrial resulted from a fear that the jury was likely to acquit the accused, different considerations would, of course, obtain.\n\n\n4\n The dissent (post, p. 474) entirely misconceives the thrust of this argument. The point is not whether one could have expected Tateo to ask for a mistrial. Rather, it is whether, if such a request had been made and either had been granted or had underlain reversal on direct review, Tateo could have been tried again. If he could have been tried again, a decision proscribing retrial if attack is collateral would mean that any lawyer worth his salt would forbear requesting a mistrial in similar circumstances, even were he certain that his position would be sustained by the trial judge or on review. That any judicial system should encourage litigants to raise objections at the earliest rather than latest possible time seems self-evident. In other words, simple logic compels the conclusion that if the Court precluded retrial here, it would also have to preclude retrial in a similar case in which a mistrial is granted. Such a result would contradict the language of both the prevailing and dissenting opinions in Gori.\n\n\n1\n In Gori v. United States, 367 U.S. 364, 81 S.Ct. 1523, 6 L.Ed.2d 901, the Court expressly refused to decide whether reprosecution would be permitted in situations 'in which the discretion of the trial judge may be abused * * * or in which a judge exercises his authority to help the prosecution * * *.' Id., at 367 U.S. 369, 81 S.Ct. at 1526. Here, the Court holds, in effect, that reprosecution is permissible in those situations.\n\n\n2\n See Note, Double Jeopardy: The Reprosecution Problem, 77 Harv.L.Rev. 1272, 1278\u20141279 (1964).\n\n\n3\n United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 41 L.Ed. 300; Note, 77 Harv.L.Rev., at 1283.\n\n\n4\n E.g., Downum v. United States, 372 U.S. 734, 83 S.Ct. 1033, 10 L.Ed.2d 100; Cornero v.

Dickerson, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 221, 271 F.2d 487.\n\n\n5\n Whether counsel is correct in this conclusion, compare United States v. Wiley, 7 Cir., 278 F.2d 500; Note, 109 U. of Pa.L.Rev. 422 (1961), is beside the point; the dilemma is real under the authorities.\n\n\n","label":0}

A three-judge court was convened and it found that appellees' likelihood of success on their constitutional claim warranted the issuance of a preliminary injunction against what it found to be the payment of welfare in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court found it unnecessary to consider appellees' statutory claims. We noted probable jurisdiction. 397 U.S. 903, 90 S.Ct. 910, 25 L.Ed.2d 85.\n\n\n2\nSubsequent to the decision of the District Court this Court rendered its decision in Rosado v.

Although the federal agency has not yet made a final decision, it appears from the brief submitted by the United States as amicus curiae that HEW has made a preliminary determination that the New York provisions do not conform to the Social Security Act's requirements. Accordingly, the statutory claim which this Court today remands to the District Court for its consideration involves a live controversy 397, 430, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 1227, 25 L.Ed.2d 442 (1970), it is my belief that such controversies should be resolved in proceedings between the two governments involved, as provided in the Social Security Act.

{"text":"420 U.S. 671\n95 S.Ct. 1255.\n43 L.Ed.2d 541\nUNITED STATES, Petitioner,v.Ralph FEOLA.\nNo. 73\u20141123.\nArgued Nov. 19, 1974.\nDecided March 19, 1975.\n\nSyllabus\nRespondent and others were convicted in a jury trial of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 for having assaulted federal officers (here undercover narcotics agents) in the performance of their official duties, and of conspiring to commit that offense, in violation of the general conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. The trial court had instructed the jurors that, in order to find any of the defendants guilty on either the conspiracy count or the substantive count, they were not required to conclude that the defendants were aware that their quarry were federal officers. The Court of Appeals approved the instructions on the substantive charges but, in reliance on United States v. Crimmins, 2 Cir., 123 F.2d 271, and its progeny, reversed the conspiracy convictions on the ground that the trial court had erred in not charging that knowledge of the victim's official identity must be proved in order to convict on the \u00a7 371 charge. Held:\n1. Section 111, which was enacted both to protect federal officers and federal functions and to provide a federal forum in which to try alleged offenders, requires no more than proof of an intent to assault, not of an intent to assault a federal officer; and it was not necessary under the substantive statute to prove that respondent and his confederates knew that their victims were federal officers. Pp. 676-686.\n2. Where knowledge of the facts giving rise to federal jurisdiction is not necessary for conviction of a substantive offense embodying a mens rea requirement, such knowledge is equally irrelevant to questions of responsibility for conspiring to commit the offense. Thus, in this case where proof of knowledge that the intended victims were federal officers was not necessary to convict under. \u00a7 111, such knowledge did not have to be proved to convict under \u00a7 371. Pp. 686-696.\n(a) There is nothing on the face of \u00a7 371 that would appear to require a greater degree of knowledge of the official status of the victim than is required in the case of the substantive statute, and at least two decisions repudiate respondent's contentions to the contrary, In re Coy, 127 U.S. 731, 8 S.Ct. 1263, 32 L.Ed. 274; United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601, 914 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356. Pp. 687-688.\n(b) The principle of the Crimmins case, supra, that to permit conspiratorial liability where the conspirators were ignorant of the federal implications of their acts would be to enlarge their agreement beyond its terms as they understood them, has no bearing on a case like the instant one where the substantive offense, assault, is not of the type outlawed without regard to the intent of the actor to accomplish the result that is made criminal. Nor can it be said that the acts contemplated by the conspirators are legally different from those actually performed solely because of the official identity of the victim. Pp. 688-693.\n(c) Imposition of a strict 'anti-federal' scienter requirement has no relationship to the purposes of the law of conspiracy, which are to protect society from the dangers of concerted criminal activity and to identify an agreement to engage in crime as sufficiently threatening to the social order to warrant its being the subject of criminal sanctions regardless of whether the crime agreed upon is actually committed. Pp. 693-694.\nUnited States v. Alsondo, 2 Cir., 486 F.2d 1339, reversed.\nAllan A. Tuttle, Raleigh, N.C., for petitioner.\nGeorge J. Bellantoni, White Plains, N.Y., for respondent.\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis case presents the issue whether knowledge that the intended victim is a federal officer is a requisite for the crime of conspiracy, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, to commit an offense violative of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111,1 that is, an assault upon a federal officer while engaged in the performance of his official duties.\n\n\n2\nRespondent Feola and three others (Alsondo, Rosa, and Farr) were indicted for violations of \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 111. A jury found all four defendants guilty of both charges.2 Feola received a sentence of four years for the conspiracy and one of three years, plus a $3,000 fine, for the assault. The three-year sentence, however, was suspended and he was given three years' probation 'to commence at the expiration of confinement' for the conspiracy. The respective appeals of Feola, Alsondo, and Rosa were considered by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in a single opinion. After an initial ruling partially to the contrary, that court affirmed the judgment of conviction on the substantive charges, but reversed the conspiracy convictions. United States v. Alsondo, 486 F.2d 1339, 1346 (1973).3 Because of a conflict among the federal Circuits on the scienter issue with respect to a conspiracy charge,4 we granted the Government's petition for a writ of certiorari in Feola's case.5 416 U.S. 935, 94 S.Ct. 1932, 40 L.Ed.2d 285 (1974).\n\n\n3\n* The facts reveal a classic narcotics 'rip-off.' The details are not particularly important for our present purposes. We need note only that the evidence shows that Feola and his confederates arranged for a sale of heroin to buyers who turned out to be undercover agents for the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. The group planned to palm off on the purchasers, for a substantial sum, a form of sugar in place of heroin and, should that ruse fail, simply to surprise their unwitting buyers and relieve them of the cash they had brought along for payment. The plan failed when one agent, his suspicions being aroused,6 drew his revolver in time to counter an assault upon another agent from the rear. Instead of enjoying the rich benefits of a successful swindle, Feola and his associates found themselves charged, to their undoubted surprise, with conspiring to assault, and with assaulting, federal officers.\n\n\n4\nAt the trial, the District Court, without objection from the defense, charged the jurors that, in order to find any of the defendants guilty on either the conspiracy count or the substantive one, they were not required to conclude that the defendants were aware that their quarry were federal officers.7\n\n\n5\nThe Court of Appeals reversed the conspiracy convictions on a ground not advanced by any of the defendants. Although it approved the trial court's instructions to the jury on the substantive charge of assaulting a federal officer,8 it nonetheless concluded that the failure to charge that knowledge of the victim's official identity must be proved in order to convict on the conspiracy charge amounted to plain error. 486 F.2d, at 1344. The court perceived itself bound by a line of cases, commencing with Judge Learned Hand's opinion in United States v. Crimmins, 123 F.2d 271 (CA2 1941), all holding that scienter of a factual element that confers federal jurisdiction, while unnecessary for conviction of the substantive offense, is required in order to sustain a conviction for conspiracy to commit the substantive offense. Although the court noted that the Crimins rationale 'has been criticized,' 486 F.2d, at 1343, and, indeed, offered no argument in support of it, it accepted 'the controlling precedents somewhat reluctantly.' Id., at 1344.\n\nII\n\n6\nThe Government's plea is for symmetry. It urges that since criminal liability for the offense described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 does not depend on whether the assailant harbored the specific intent to assault a federal officer, no greater scienter requirement can be engrafted upon the conspiracy offense, which is merely an agreement to commit the act proscribed by \u00a7 111. Consideration of the Government's contention requires us preliminarily to pass upon its premise, the proposition that responsibility for assault upon a federal officer does not depend upon whether the assailant was aware of the official identity of his victim at the time he acted.\n\n\n7\nThat the 'federal officer' requirement is anything other than jurisdictional9 is not seriously urged upon us; indeed, both Feola10 and the Court of Appeals, 486 F.2d at 1342, concede that scienter is not a necessary element of the substantive offense under \u00a7 111. Although some early cases were to the contrary,11 the concession recognizes what is now the practical unanimity of the Courts of Appeals.12 Nevertheless, we are not always guided by concessions of the parties, and the very considerations of symmetry urged by the Government suggest that we first turn our attention to the substantive offense.\n\n\n8\nThe Court has considered \u00a7 111 before. In Ladner v. United States, 358 U.S. 169, 79 S.Ct. 209, 3 L.Ed.2d 199 (1958), the issue was whether a single shotgun blast which wounded two federal agents effected multiple assaults, within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 (1940 ed.), one of the statutory predecessors to the present \u00a7 111.13 The Government urged that s 254 had been intended not only to deter interference with federal law enforcement activities but, as well, to forestall injury to individual officers, as 'wards' of the United States. Given the latter formulation of legislative intent, argued the Government, a single blast wounding two officers would constitute two offenses. The Court disagreed because it found an equally plausible reading of the legislative intent to be that 'the congressional aim was to prevent hindrance to the execution of official duty . . . and was not to protect federal officers except as incident to that aim,' 358 U.S., at 175\u2014176, 79 S.Ct. at 213. Under that view of legislative purpose, to have punishment depend upon the number of officers impeded would be incongruous. With no clear choice between these alternative formulations of congressional intent, in light of the statutory language and sparse legislative history, the Court applied a policy of lenity and, for purposes of the case, adopted the less harsh reading. Id., at 177\u2014178, 79 S.Ct., at 213\u2014214. It therefore held that the single discharge of a shotgun constituted only a single violation of \u00a7 254.\n\n\n9\nIn the present case, we see again the possible consequences of an interpretation of \u00a7 111 that focuses on only one of the statute's apparent aims. If the primary purpose is to protect federal law enforcement personnel, that purpose could well be frustrated by the imposition of a strict scienter requirement. On the other hand, if \u00a7 111 is seen primarily as an anti-obstruction statute, it is likely that Congress intended criminal liability to be imposed only when a person acted with the specific intent to impede enforcement activities. Otherwise, it has been said: 'Were knowledge not required in obstruction of justice offenses described by these terms, wholly innocent (or even socially desirable) behavior could be transformed into a felony by the wholly fortuitous circumstance of the concealed identity of the person resisted.'14 Although we adhere to the conclusion in Ladner that either view of legislative intent is 'plausible,' we think it plain that Congress intended to protect both federal officers and federal functions, and that, indeed, furtherance of the one policy advances the other. The rejection of a strict scienter requirement is consistent with both purposes.\n\n\n10\nSection 111 has its origin in \u00a7 2 of the Act of May 18, 1934, c. 299, 48 Stat. 781. Section 1 of that Act, in which the present 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114 has its roots, made it a federal crime to kill certain federal law enforcement personnel while engaged in, or on account of, the performance of official duties,15 and \u00a7 2 forbade forcible resistance or interference with, or assault upon, any officer designated in \u00a7 1 while so engaged. The history of the 1934 Act, though scanty, offers insight into its multiple purposes. The pertinent committee reports consist, almost in their entirety, of a letter dated January 3, 1934, from Attorney General Cummings urging the passage of the legislation.16 In that letter the Attorney General states that this was needed 'for the protection of Federal officers and employees.' Compelled reliance upon state courts, 'however respectable and well disposed, for the protection of (federal) investigative and law-enforcement personnel' was inadequate, and there was need for resort to a federal forum.\n\n\n11\nAlthough the letter refers only to the need to protect federal personnel, Congress clearly was concerned with the safety of federal officers insofar as it was tied to the efficacy of law enforcement activities. This concern is implicit in the decision to list those officers protected rather than merely to forbid assault on any federal employee. Indeed, the statute as originally formulated would have prohibited attack on 'any civil official, inspector, agent, or other officer or employee of the United States.' See H.R.Rep.No.1455, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1934). The House rejected this and insisted on the version that was ultimately enacted. Although the reason for the insistence is unexplained, it is fair to assume that the House was of the view that the bill as originally drafted strayed too far from the purpose of insuring the integrity of law enforcement pursuits.17\n\n\n12\nIn resolving the question whether Congress intended to condition responsibility for violation of \u00a7 111 on the actor's awareness of the identity of his victim, we give weight to both purposes of the statute, but here again, as in Ladner, we need not make a choice between them. Rather, regardless of which purpose we would emphasize, we must take note of the means Congress chose for its achievement.\n\n\n13\nAttorney General Cummings, in his letter, emphasized the importance of providing a federal forum in which attacks upon named federal officers could be prosecuted. This, standing alone, would not indicate a congressional conclusion to dispense with a requirement of specific intent to assault a federal officer, for the locus of the forum does not of itself define the reach of the substantive offense. But the view that \u00a7 111 requires knowledge of the victim's office rests on the proposition that the reference to the federal forum was merely a shorthand expression of the need for a statute to fill a gap in the substantive law of the States. See United States v. Fernandez, 497 F.2d 730, 745 (CA9 1974) (concurring opinion), cert. pending, No. 73\u20146868. In that view \u00a7 111 is seen merely as a federal aggravated assault statute, necessary solely because some state laws mandate increased punishment only for assaults on state peace officers; assaults on federal personnel would be punishable, under state law, only for simple assault. As a federal aggravated assault statute, \u00a7 111 would be read as requiring the same degree of knowledge as its state-law counterparts. See Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 263, 72 S.Ct. 240, 249, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952). The argument fails, however, because it is fairly certain that Congress was not enacting \u00a7 111 as a federal counterpart to state proscriptions of aggravated assault.\n\n\n14\nThe Attorney General's call for a federal forum in which to prosecute an attacker of a federal officer was directed at both sections of the proposed bill that became the 1934 Act. The letter concerned not only the section prohibiting assaults but also the section prohibiting killings. The latter, \u00a7 1, was not needed to fill a gap in existing substantive state law. The States proscribed murder, and, until recently, with the enactment of certain statutes in response to the successful attack on capital punishment, murder of a peace officer has not been deemed an aggravated form of murder, for all States usually have punished murderers with the most severe sanction the law allows. Clearly, then, Congress understood that it was not only filling one gap in state substantive law but in large part was duplicating state proscriptions in order to insure a federal forum for the trial of offenses involving federal officers. Fulfillment of the congressional goal to protect federal officers required then, as it does now, the highest possible degree of certainty that those who killed or assaulted federal officers were brought to justice. In the congressional mind, with the reliance upon the Attorney General's letter, certainty required that these cases be tried in the federal courts, for no matter how 'respectable and well disposed,' it would not be unreasonable to suppose that state officials would not always or necessarily share congressional feelings of urgency as to the necessity of prompt and vigorous prosecutions of those who violate the safety of the federal officer. From the days of prohibition to the days of the modern civil rights movement, the statutes federal agents have sworn to uphold and enforce have not always been popular in every corner of the Nation. Congress may well have concluded that \u00a7 111 was necessary in order to insure uniformly vigorous protection of federal personnel, including those engaged in locally unpopular activity.\n\n\n15\nWe conclude, from all this, that in order to effectuate the congressional purpose of according maximum protection to federal officers by making prosecution for assaults upon them cognizable in the federal courts, \u00a7 111 cannot be construed as embodying an unexpressed requirement that an assailant be aware that his victim is a federal officer. All the statute requires is an intent to assault, not an intent to assault a federal officer. A contrary conclusion would give insufficient protection to the agent enforcing an unpopular law, and none to the agent acting under cover.18\n\n\n16\nThis interpretation poses no risk of unfairness to defendants. It is no snare for the unsuspecting. Although the perpetrator of a narcotics 'rip-off,' such as the one involved here, may be surprised to find that his intended victim is a federal officer in civilian apparel, he nonetheless knows from the very outset that his planned course of conduct is wrongful. The situation is not one where legitimate conduct becomes unlawful solely because of the identity of the individual or agency affected. In a case of this kind the offender takes his victim as he finds him. The concept of criminal intent does not extend so far as to require that the actor understand not only the nature of his act but also its consequence for the choice of a judicial forum.\n\n\n17\nWe are not to be understood as implying that the defendant's state of knowledge is never a relevant consideration under \u00a7 111. The statute does require a criminal intent, and there may well be circumstances in which ignorance of the official status of the person assaulted or resisted negates the very existence of mens rea. For example, where an officer fails to identify himself or his purpose, his conduct in certain circumstances might reasonably be interpreted as the unlawful use of force directed either at the defendant or his property. In a situation of that kind, one might be justified in exerting an element of resistance, and an honest mistake of fact would not be consistent with criminal intent.19\n\n\n18\nWe hold, therefore, that in order to incur criminal liability under \u00a7 111 an actor must entertain merely the criminal intent to do the acts therein specified. We now consider whether the rule should be different where persons conspire to commit those acts.\n\nIII\n\n19\nOur decisions establish that in order to sustain a judgment of conviction on a charge of conspiracy to violate a federal statute, the Government must prove at least the degree of criminal intent necessary for the substantive offense itself. Ingram v. United States, 360 U.S. 672, 678, 79 S.Ct. 1314, 1319, 3 L.Ed.2d 1503 (1959). See Pettibone v. United States, 148 U.S. 197, 13 S.Ct. 542, 37 L.Ed. 419 (1893). Respondent Feola urges upon us the proposition that the Government must show a degree of criminal intent in the conspiracy count greater than is necessary to convict for the substantive offense; he urges that even though it is not necessary to show that he was aware of the official identity of his assaulted victims in order to find him guilty of assaulting federal officers, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111, the Government nonetheless must show that he was aware that his intended victims were undercover agents, if it is successfully to prosecute him for conspiring to assault federal agents. And the Court of Appeals held that the trial court's failure to charge the jury to this effect constituted plain error.\n\n\n20\nThe general conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371,20 offers no textual support for the proposition that to be guilty of conspiracy a defendant in effect must have known that his conduct violated federal law. The statute makes it unlawful simply to 'conspire . . . to commit any offense against the United States.' A natural reading of these words would be that since one can violate a criminal statute simply by engaging in the forbidden conduct, a conspiracy to commit that offense is nothing more than an agreement to engage in the prohibited conduct. Then where, as here, the substantive statute does not require that an assailant know the official status of his victim, there is nothing on the face of the conspiracy statute that would seem to require that those agreeing to the assault have a greater degree of knowledge.\n\n\n21\nWe have been unable to find any decision of this Court that lends support to the respondent. On the contrary, at least two of our cases implicitly repudiate his position. The appellants in In re Coy, 127 U.S. 731, 8 S.Ct. 1263, 32 L.Ed. 274 (1888), were convicted of conspiring to induce state election officials to neglect their duty to safeguard ballots and election results. The offense occurred with respect to an election at which Indiana voters, in accordance with state law, voted for both local officials and members of Congress. Much like Feola here, those appellants asserted that they could not be punished for conspiring to violate federal law because they had intended only to affect the outcome of state races. In short, it was urged that the conspiracy statute embodied a requirement of specific intent to violate federal law. Id., at 753, 8 S.Ct. at 1269. The Court rejected this contention and held that the statute required only that the conspirators agree to participate in the prohibited conduct. See Anderson v. United States, 417 U.S. 211, 226, 94 S.Ct. 2253, 2263, 41 L.Ed.2d 20 (1974).\n\n\n22\nSimilarly, in United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (1971), we reversed the dismissal of an indictment charging defendants with possession of, and with conspiracy to possess, hand grenades that had not been registered, as reguired by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d). The trial court dismissed the indictment for failure to allege that the defendants knew that the hand grenades in fact were unregistered. We held that actual knowledge that the grenades were unregistered was not an element of the substantive offense created by Congress and therefore upheld the indictment both as to the substantive offense and as to the charge of conspiracy. Again, we declined to require a greater degree of intent for conspiratorial responsibility than for responsibility for the underlying substantive offense.\n\n\n23\nWith no support on the face of the general conspiracy statute or in this Court's decisions, respondent relies solely on the line of cases commencing with United States v. Crimmins, 123 F.2d 271 (CA2 1941), for the principle that the Government must prove'antifederal' intent in order to establish liability under \u00a7 371. In Crimmins, the defendant had been found guilty of conspiring to receive stolen bonds that had been transported in interstate commerce. Upon review, the Court of Appeals pointed out that the evidence failed to establish that Crimmins actually knew the stolen bonds had moved into the State. Accepting for the sake of argument the assumption that such knowledge was not necessary to sustain a conviction on the substantive offense, Judge Learned Hand nevertheless concluded that to permit conspiratorial liability where the conspirators were ignorant of the federal implications of their acts would be to enlarge their agreement beyond its terms as they understood them. He capsulized the distinction in what has become well known as his 'traffic light' analogy:\n\n\n24\n'While one may, for instance, be guilty of running past a      traffic light of whose existence one is ignorant, one cannot      be guilty of conspiring to run past such a light, for one      cannot agree to run past a light unless one supposes that      there is a light to run past.' Id., at 273.\n\n\n25\nJudge Hand's attractive, but perhaps seductive, analogy has received a mixed reception in the Courts of Appeals. The Second Circuit, of course, has followed it;21 others have rejected it.22 It appears that most have avoided it by the simple expedient of inferring the requisite knowledge from the scope of the conspiratorial venture.23 We conclude that the analogy, though effective prose, is, as applied to the facts before us, bad law.24\n\n\n26\nThe question posed by the traffic light analogy is not before us, just as it was not before the Second Circuit in Crimmins. Criminal liability, of course, may be imposed on one who runs a traffic light regardless of whether he harbored the 'evil intent' of disobeying the light's command; whether he drove so recklessly as to be unable to perceive the light; whether, thinking he was observing all traffic rules, he simply failed to notice the light; or whether, having been reared elsewhere, he thought that the light was only an ornament. Traffic violations generally fall into that category of offenses that dispense with a mens rea requirement. See United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277, 64 S.Ct. 134, 88 L.Ed. 48 (1943). These laws embody the social judgment that it is fair to punish one who intentionally engages in conduct that creates a risk to others, even though no risk is intended or the actor, through no fault of his own, is completely unaware of the existence of any risk. The traffic light analogy poses the question whether it is fair to punish parties to an agreement to engage intentionally in apparently innocent conduct where the unintended result of engaging in that conduct is the violation of a criminal statute.\n\n\n27\nBut this case does not call upon us to answer this question, and we decline to do so, just as we have once before. United States v. Freed, 401 U.S., at 609 n. 14, 91 S.Ct. at 1118. We note in passing, however, that the analogy comes close to stating what has been known as the 'Powell doctrine,' originating in People v. Powell, 63 N.Y. 88 (1875), to the effect that a conspiracy, to be criminal, must be animated by a corrupt motive or a motive to do wrong. Under this principle, such a motive could be easily demonstrated if the underlying offense involved an act clearly wrongful in itself; but it had to be independently demonstrated if the acts agreed to were wrongful solely because of statutory proscription. See Note, Developments in the Law\u2014Criminal Conspiracy, 72 Harv.L.Rev. 920, 936\u2014937 (1959). Interestingly, Judge Hand himself was one of the more severe critics of the Powell doctrine.25\n\n\n28\nThat Judge Hand should reject the Powell doctrine and then create the Crimmins doctrine seems curious enough. Fatal to the latter, however, is the fact that it was announced in a case to which it could not have been meant to apply. In Crimmins, the substantive offense, namely, the receipt of stolen securities that had been in interstate commerce, proscribed clearly wrongful conduct. Such conduct could not be engaged in without an intent to accomplish the forbidden result. So, too, it is with assault, the conduct forbidden by the substantive statute, \u00a7 111, presently before us. One may run a traffic light 'of whose existence one is ignorant,' but assaulting another 'of whose existence one is ignorant,' probably would require unearthly intervention. Thus, the traffic light analogy, even if it were a correct statement of the law, is inapt, for the conduct proscribed by the substantive offense, here assault, is not of the type outlawed without regard to the intent of the actor to accomplish the result that is made criminal. If the analogy has any vitality at all, it is to conduct of the latter variety; that, however, is a question we save for another day. We hold here only that where a substantive offense embodies only a requirement of mens rea as to each of its elements, the general federal conspiracy statute requires no more.\n\n\n29\nThe Crimmins rule rests upon another foundation: that it is improper to find conspiratorial liability where the parties to the illicit agreement were not aware of the fact giving rise to federal jurisdiction, because the essence of conspiracy is agreement and persons cannot be punished for acts beyond the scope of their agreement. 123 F.2d, at 273. This 'reason' states little more than a conclusion, for it is clear that one may be guilty as a conspirator for acts the precise details of which one does not know at the time of the agreement. See Blumenthal v. United States, 332 U.S. 539, 557, 68 S.Ct. 248, 256, 92 L.Ed. 154 (1947). The question is not merely whether the official status of an assaulted victim was known to the parties at the time of their agreement, but whether the acts contemplated by the conspirators are to be deemed legally different from those actually performed solely because of the official identity of the victim. Put another way, does the identity of the proposed victim alter the legal character of the acts agreed to, or is it no more germane to the nature of those acts than the color of the victim's hair?\n\n\n30\nOur analysis of the substantive offense in Part II, supra, is sufficient to convince us that for the purpose of individual guilt or innocence, awareness of the official identity of the assault victim is irrelevant. We would expect the same to obtain with respect to the conspiracy offense unless one of the policies behind the imposition of conspiratorial liability is not served where the parties to the agreement are unaware that the intended target is a federal law enforcement official.\n\n\n31\nIt is well settled that the law of conspiracy serves ends different from, and complementary to, those served by criminal prohibitions of the substantive offense. Because of this, consecutive sentences may be imposed for the conspiracy and for the underlying crime. Callanan v. United States, 364 U.S. 587, 81 S.Ct. 321, 5 L.Ed.2d 312 (1961); Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946). Our decisions have identified two independent values served by the law of conspiracy. The first is protection of society from the dangers of concerted criminal activity, Callanan v. United States, supra, 364 U.S., at 593, 81 S.Ct., at 325; Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494, 573 574, 71 S.Ct. 857, 899\u2014900, 95 L.Ed. 1137 (1951) (Jackson, J., concurring). That individuals know that their planned joint venture violates federal as well as state law seems totally irrelevant to that purpose of conspiracy law which seeks to protect society from the dangers of concerted criminal activity. Given the level of criminal intent necessary to sustain conviction for the substantive offense, the act of agreement to commit the crime is no less opprobrious and no less dangerous because of the absence of knowledge of a fact unnecessary to the formation of criminal intent. Indeed, unless imposition of an 'antifederal' knowledge requirement serves social purposes external to the law of conspiracy of which we are unaware, its imposition here would serve only to make it more difficult to obtain convictions on charges of conspiracy, a policy with no apparent purpose.\n\n\n32\nThe second aspect is that conspiracy is an inchoate crime. This is to say, that, although the law generally makes criminal only antisocial conduct, at some point in the continuum between preparation and consummation, the likelihood of a commission of an act is sufficiently great and the criminal intent sufficiently well formed to justify the intervention of the criminal law. See Note, Developments in the Law\u2014Criminal Conspiracy, 72 Harv.L.Rev., at 923\u2014925. The law of conspiracy identifies the agreement to engage in a criminal venture as an event of sufficient threat to social order to permit the imposition of criminal sanctions for the agreement alone, plus an overt act in pursuit of it, regardless of whether the crime agreed upon actually is committed. United States v. Bayer, 331 U.S. 532, 542, 67 S.Ct. 1394, 1399, 91 L.Ed. 1654 (1947). Criminal intent has crystallized, and the likelihood of actual, fulfilled commission warrants preventive action.\n\n\n33\nAgain, we do not see how imposition of a strict 'anti-federal' scienter requirement would relate to this purpose of conspiracy law. Given the level of intent needed to carry out the substantive offense, we fail to see how the agreement is any less blameworthy or constitutes less of a danger to society solely because the participants are unaware which body of law they intend to violate. Therefore, we again conclude that imposition of a requirement of knowledge of those facts that serve only to establish federal jurisdiction would render it more difficult to serve the policy behind the law of conspiracy without serving any other apparent social policy.\n\n\n34\nWe hold, then, that assault of a federal officer pursuant to an agreement to assault is not, even in the words of Judge Hand, 'beyond the reasonable intendment of the common understanding,' United States v. Crimmins, 123 F.2d, at 273. The agreement is not thereby enlarged, for knowledge of the official identity of the victim is irrelevant to the essential nature of the agreement, entrance into which is made criminal by the law of conspiracy.\n\n\n35\nAgain we point out, however, that the state of knowledge of the parties to an agreement is not always irrelevant in a proceeding charging a violation of conspiracy law. First, the knowledge of the parties is relevant to the same issues and to the same extent as it may be for conviction of the substantive offense. Second, whether conspirators knew the official identity of their quarry may be important, in some cases, in establishing the existence of federal jurisdiction. The jurisdictional requirement is satisfied by the existence of facts tying the proscribed conduct to the area of federal concern delineated by the statute. Federal jurisdiction always exists where the substantive offense is committed in the manner therein described, that is, when a federal officer is attacked. Where, however, there is an unfulfilled agreement to assault, it must be established whether the agreement, standing alone, constituted a sufficient threat to the safety of a federal officer so as to give rise to federal jurisdiction. If the agreement calls for an attack on an individual specifically identified, either by name or by some unique characteristic, as the putative buyers in the present case, and that specifically identified individual is in fact a federal officer, the agreement may be fairly characterized as one calling for an assault upon a federal officer, even though the parties were unaware of the victim's actual identity and even though they would not have agreed to the assault had they known that identity. Where the object of the intended attack is not identified with sufficient specificity so as to give rise to the conclusion that had the attack been carried out the victim would have been a federal officer, it is impossible to assert that the mere act of agreement to assault poses a sufficient threat to federal personnel and functions so as to give rise to federal jurisdiction.\n\n\n36\nTo summarize, with the exception of the infrequent situation in which reference to the knowledge of the parties to an illegal agreement is necessary to establish the existence of federal jurisdiction, we hold that where knowledge of the facts giving rise to federal jurisdiction is not necessary for conviction of a substantive offense embodying a mens rea requirement, such knowledge is equally irrelevant to questions of responsibility for conspiracy to commit that offense.\n\n\n37\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to the respondent's conspiracy conviction is reversed.\n\n\n38\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n39\nJudgment of Court of Appeals with respect to conspiracy conviction reversed.\n\n\n40\nMr. Justice STEWART, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS joins, dissenting.\n\n\n41\nDoes an assault on a federal officer violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111 even when the assailant is unaware, and has no reason to know, that the victim is other than a private citizen or, indeed, a confederate in crime? This important question, never decided by the Court, is squarely presented in a petition for certiorari that has been pending here for many months: No. 73\u20146868, Fernandez v. United States.2 But this question was not contained in the petition for certiorari in the present case, and has not been addressed in either the briefs or oral arguments. The parties have merely assumed the answer to the question, and directed their attention to the separate question whether scienter is an element of conspiring to violate \u00a7 111. Nevertheless the Court sets out sua sponte to decide the basic question presented in Fernandez without the benefit of either briefing or oral argument by counsel.\n\n\n42\nThis conspicuous disregard of the most basic principle of our adversary system of justice seems to me indefensible. Clearly, the petition for certiorari in Fernandez should have been granted, and that case decided after briefing and oral argument on its merits, before the subsidiary issue in the present case was considered. It is not too late to correct the serious judicial mistake the Court has made. We should grant certiorari in Fernandez now, and set the present case for rehearing after the argument in Fernandez has been had. But the Court rejects that course, and I perforce address the fundamental Fernandez question.\n\n\n43\nThe Court recognizes that '(t)he question . . . is not whether the ('federal officer') requirement is jurisdictional, but whether it is jurisdictional only.' Ante, p. 677 n. 9. Put otherwise, the question is whether Congress intended to write an aggravated assault statute, analogous to the many state statutes which protect the persons and functions of state officers against assault, or whether Congress intended merely to federalize every assault which happens to have a federal officer as its victim. The Court chooses the latter interpretation, reading the federal-officer requirement to be jurisdictional only. This conclusion is inconsistent with the pertinent legislative history, the verbal structure of \u00a7 111, accepted canons of statutory construction, and the dictates of common sense.\n\n\n44\nMany States provide an aggravated penalty for assaults upon state law enforcement officers; typically the victim-status element transforms the assault from a misdemeanor to a felony.3 These statutes have a twofold purpose: to reflect the societal gravity associated with assaulting a public officer and, by providing an enhanced deterrent against such assault, to accord to public officers and their functions a protection greater than that which the law of assault otherwise provides to private citizens and their private activities.4 Consonant with these purposes, the accused's knowledge that his victim had an official status or function is invariably recognized by the States as an essential element of the aggravated offense.5 Where an assailant had no such knowledge, he could not of course be deterred by the statutory threat of enhanced punishment, and it makes no sense to regard the unknowing assault as being any more reprehensible, in a moral or retributive sense, than if the victim had been, as the assailant supposed, a private citizen.\n\n\n45\nThe state statutes protect only state officers. I would read \u00a7 111 as filling the gap and supplying analogous protection for federal officers and their functions. An aggravated penalty should apply only where an assailant knew, or had reason to know, that his victim had some official status or function. It is immaterial whether the assailant knew the victim was employed by the federal, as opposed to a state or local, government. That is a matter of 'jurisdiction only,' for it does not affect the moral gravity of the act. If the victim was a federal officer, \u00a7 111 applies; if he was a state or local officer, an analogous state statute or local ordinance will generally apply. But where the assailant reasonably thought his victim a common citizen or, indeed, a confederate in crime, aggravation is simply out of place, and the case should be tried in the appropriate forum under the general law of assault, as are unknowing assaults on state officers.\n\n\n46\nThe history of \u00a7 111 permits no doubt that this is an aggravated assault statute, requiring proof of scienter. The provision derives from a 1934 statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 (1940 ed.), set out in the margin.6 The Attorney General proposed the statute in a letter to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary; the Attorney General's reasons are the only ones on record for the provision.7 The federal officers covered were listed in a companion provision, simultaneously enacted, proscribing the killing of federal officers.8 The present \u00a7 111 emerged from the 1948 recodification of Title 18,9 'with changes in phraseology and substance necessary to effect the consolidation' of the former \u00a7 254 with a minor 1909 statute proscribing assaults on officers of the 'Bureau of Animal Industry of the Department of Agriculture.'10 As the Court has recognized, the purport of the present \u00a7 111 must be derived from its major source, the 1934 enactment. See Ladner v. United States, 358 U.S. 169, 176 n. 4, 79 S.Ct. 209, 213, 3 L.Ed.2d 199.\n\n\n47\nRummaging through the spare legislative history of the 1934 law, the Court manages to persuade itself that Congress intended to reach unknowing assaults on federal officers. Ante, pp. 679-684. But if that was the congressional intention, which I seriously doubt, it found no expression in the legislative product. The fact is that the 1934 statute expressly required scienter for an assault conviction. An assault on a federal officer was proscribed only if perpetrated 'on account of the performance of his official duties.' See n. 6, supra. That is, it was necessary not only that the assailant have notice that his victim possessed official status or duties but also that the assailant's motive be retaliation against the exercise of those duties.\n\n\n48\nIt was not until the 1948 recodification that the proscription was expanded to cover assaults on federal officers 'while engaged in,' as well as 'on account of,' the performance of official duties. This was, as the Reviser observed, a technical alteration; it produced no instructive legislative history. See n. 10, supra. As presently written, the statute does clearly reach knowing assaults regardless of motive. But to suggest that it also reaches wholly unknowing assaults is to convert the 1948 alteration into one of major substantive importance, which it concededly was not.\n\n\n49\nThe Court has also managed to convince itself that \u00a7 254 was not an aggravated assault statute. The surest evidence that \u00a7 254 was an aggravated assault statute may be found in its penalty provision.11 A single unarmed assault was made, and remains, punishable by a sentence of three years' imprisonment and a $5,000 fine. One need not make an exhaustive survey of state law to appreciate that this is a harsher penalty than is typically imposed for an unarmed assault on a private citizen. In 1934, federal law already defined and proscribed all varieties of assault occurring within the admiralty, maritime, and territorial jurisdiction of the United States: The penalty structure extended in graded steps, turning on the intent and methods of the assailant, from three months' to 20 years' imprisonment.12 If Congress had intended the victim-status element in \u00a7 254 to be 'jurisdictional only'\u2014to provide merely another jurisdictional basis for trying assaults in the federal courts\u2014there would have been no need to append a new and unique penalty provision to \u00a7 254. Instead, Congress could simply have made cross-reference to the pre-existing penalty structure for assaults within federal jurisdiction. This is not idle speculation. It was precisely the solution adopted, in the same 1934 Act, for the new offense of killing a federal officer: Congress provided that that new offense be defined and punished according to the pre-existing, graded, penalty structure for homicides within the maritime, admiralty, and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.13\n\n\n50\nThis deliberated difference in definition and penalty treatment between the homicide and the assault statutes has an obvious significance. Congress gave to the new assault statute a unique and substantively novel definition and penalty. Unless we wish to assume that Congress was scatterbrained, we must conclude that it regarded the victim-status element as of substantive\u2014and not merely jurisdictional\u2014importance. That element was seen as an aggravating circumstance, just as is true in the state statutes, and not merely as a factor giving federal prosecutors and judges jurisdiction to deal with the offense.\n\n\n51\nThe Court reasons otherwise. Positing that the victim-status element in the homicide statute is jurisdictional only, the Court concludes that the same must be true of the assault statute. Ante, pp. 683-684. Even assuming the premise, the conclusion does not follow. Quite apart from the radically different ways in which the two statutes provide for offense-definition and penalties, it requires little imagination to appreciate how Congress could regard the victimstatus element as 'jurisdictional only' in the homicide case but substantively significant in the assault case. The Court itself supplies a possible reason:\n\n\n52\n'(The homicide statute) was not needed to fill a gap in      existing substantive state law. The States proscribed murder,      and, until recently, with the enactment of certain statutes      in response to the successful attack on capital punishment,      murder of a peace officer has not been deemed an aggravated      form of murder, for all States usually have punished      murderers with the most severe sanction the law allows.'      Ante, pp. 683.\n\n\n53\nIn other words, the Court suggests that the widely perceived distinction, in morality and social policy, between assaults, depending upon the assailant's knowledge of the identity of the victim, found little or no echo in the law of homicide. From this, the natural conclusion\u2014fortified by the penalty provisions\u2014would be that Congress discriminated between the two statutes, recognizing the substantive distinction in the one and not in the other. For reasons I cannot fathom, the Court instead assumes that Congress was unable to discriminate in this fashion\u2014that what had been self-evident to state legislatures was beyond the capacity of the National Legislature to comprehend. The Court says it cannot believe 'Congress silently chose to treat assaults and homicides differently. . . . (W)e have before us one bill with a single legislative history, and we decline to bifurcate our interpretation.' Ante, p. 685 n. 18. But it was Congress itself that 'bifurcated' the 1934 statute\u2014by treating homicides and assaults differently as regards penalty and offense definition, and by proscribing only those assaults that were 'on account of the performance of official duties.' What the Court 'declines' to do is to read the statute that Congress wrote.\n\n\n54\nWhile the legislative history of the 1934 law is 'scant,' Ladner v. United States, 358 U.S., at 174, 79 S.Ct., at 212, it is sufficient to locate a congressional purpose consistent only with implication of a scienter requirement. As the Court said in Ladner: '(T)he congressional aim was to prevent hindrance to the execution of official duty, and thus to assure the carrying out of federal purposes and interests, and was not to protect federal officers except as incident to that aim.' Id., at 175\u2014176, 79 S.Ct., at 213. This purpose is, of course, exactly analogous to the purposes supporting the state statutes which provide enhanced punishment for assault on state officers. A statute proscribing interference with official duty does not 'prevent hindrance' with that duty where the assailant thinks his victim is a mere private citizen, or indeed, a confederate in his criminal activity.\n\n\n55\nTo avoid this self-evident proposition, the Court effectively overrules Ladner and concludes that the assault statute aims as much at protecting individual officers as it does at protecting the functions they execute. Ante, pp. 677-682. If the Ladner Court had shared this opinion, it would not have held, as it did, that a single shotgun blast wounding two federal agents was to be considered a single assault. But in any event, even today's revisionist treatment of Ladner does not succeed in getting the Court where it wants to go. So far as the scienter requirement is concerned, it makes no difference whether the statute aims to protect individuals, or functions, or both. The Court appears to think that extending \u00a7 111 to unknowing assaults will deter such assaults\u2014will 'give . . . protection . . . to the agent acting under cover.' Ante, p. 684. This, of course, is nonsense. The federal statute 'protects' an officer from assault only when the assailant knows that the victim is an officer. Absent such knowledge, the only 'protection' is that provided by the general law of assault, for that is the only law which the potential assailant reasonably, if erroneously, believes applicable in the circumstances.\n\n\n56\nThe Court also suggests that implication of a scienter requirement 'would give insufficient protection to the agent enforcing an unpopular law.' This is to repeat the same error. Whatever the 'popularity' of the laws he is executing, and whatever the construction placed on \u00a7 111, a federal officer is 'protected' from assault by that statute only where the assailant has some indication from the circumstances that his victim is other than a private citizen. Assuming, arguendo, that Congress thought that local prosecutors and judges were insufficiently enthusiastic about trying cases involving assaults on federal officers, it remains the fact that a federal statute proscribing knowing assaults meets this concern in every case where local attitudes might conceivably embolden the populace to interfere with federal officers enforcing an 'unpopular' law.\n\n\n57\nThe fact is that there is absolutely no indication that before 1934 local prosecutors and judges were lax in trying cases involving assaults on federal officers, that Congress thought so, or\u2014and this is the major point\u2014that Congress was so obsessed by the esoteric 'problem' of unknowing assaults on officers who, if known, would be unpopular, as to enact a statute severely aggravated in penalty but blind to the commonsense distinction between knowing and unknowing assaults. The list of covered officers was long and varied in 1934; it has since become even more so.14 I can perceive no design to single out officers charged with the execution of 'unpopular' laws or given to using undercover techniques. The Attorney General's letter15 in support of the 1934 enactment disavowed any criticism of the integrity or good faith of local law enforcement authorities. He was at pains to stress that the 'Federal Government should not be compelled to rely upon the courts of the states, however respectable and well disposed . . ..' His particular concern was that '(i)n these cases resort must usually be had to the local police court, which affords but little relief to us, under the circumstances, in our effort to further the legitimate purposes of the Federal Government.' This is most reasonably read as a reference to the fact that, absent some statute aggravating the offense, assault was and is merely a misdemeanor\u2014a 'police court' offense\u2014in many States. To deal with this problem, the Attorney General sought enactment of a federal aggravated assault statute, Congress obliged, and this Court should give the statute its natural interpretation.\n\n\n58\nTurning from the history of the statute to its structure, the propriety of implying a scienter requirement becomes manifest. The statute proscribes not only assault but also a whole series of related acts. It applies to any person who 'forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with (a federal officer) . . . while engaged in or on account of the performance of his official duties.' (Emphasis added.) It can hardly be denied that the emphasized words imply a scienter requirement. Generally speaking, these acts are legal and moral wrongs only if the actor knows that his 'victim' enjoys a moral or legal privilege to detain him or order him about. These are terms of art, arising out of the common and statutory law proscribing obstruction of justice.16 Indeed, in urging enactment of \u00a7 254, the Attorney General referred to obstruction statutes, having either express or implied scienter requirements, as an instructive analogue.17 Whether it be express or implied, scienter has always been regarded in this country as an essential element of obstruction of justice. Pettibone v. United States, 148 U.S. 197, 204\u2014207, 13 S.Ct. 542, 545\u2014547, 37 L.Ed. 419. The sole innovation in \u00a7 111 is its protection of executive officers and functions, rather than judicial officers and functions. Obviously this distinction should have no effect on the scienter requirement.\n\n\n59\nIf the words grouped in the statute with 'assaults' require scienter, it follows that scienter is also required for an assault conviction. One need hardly rely on such Latin Phrases as ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis to reach this obvious conclusion. The Court suggests that assault may be treated differently, 'with no risk of unfairness,' because an assailant\u2014unlike one who merely 'opposes' or 'resists'\u2014'knows from the very outset that his planned course of conduct is wrongful' even though he 'may be surprised to find that his intended victim is a federal officer in civilian apparel.' Ante, p. 685. This argument will not do, either as a matter of statutory construction or as a matter of elementary justice.\n\n\n60\nThe Court is saying that because all assaults are wrong, it is 'fair' to regard them all as equally wrong. This is a strange theory of justice. As the States recognize, an unknowing assault on an officer is less reprehensible than a knowing assault; to provide that the former may be punished as harshly as the latter is to create a very real 'risk of unfairness.' It is not unprecedented for Congress to enact stringent legislation, but today it is the Court that rewrites a statute so as to create an inequity which Congress itself had no intention of inflicting.\n\n\n61\nTo treat assaults differently from the other acts associated with it in the statute is a pure exercise in judicial legislation. In Ladner v. United States, 358 U.S., at 176, 79 S.Ct., at 213, the Court noted that the 'Government frankly conceded on the oral argument that assault can be treated no differently from the other outlawed activities.' The Court characterized this concession as 'necessary in view of the lack of any indication that assault was to be treated differently, and in light of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111, the present recodification of \u00a7 254, which lumps assault in with the rest of the offensive actions,' id., at 176 n. 4, 79 S.Ct. 213. This analysis was not mere dictum but strictly necessary to the result reached in Ladner. No contrary analysis can be squared with the statutory history.18\n\n\n62\nThe implication of scienter here is as necessary and proper as it was in Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288. The Court there read a scienter requirement into a federal larceny statute over the government's objection that the need for scienter should not be implied for a federal offense when the statute that created the offense was silent on the subject. The Court said:\n\n\n63\n'Congressional silence as to mental elements in an Act merely      adopting into federal statutory law a concept of crime      already so well defined in common law and statutory      interpretation by the states may warrant quite contrary      inferences than the same silence in creating an offense new      to general law, for whose definition the courts have no      guidance except the Act. . . .\n\n\n64\n'. . . (W)here Congress borrows terms of art in which are      accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of      practice, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas      that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of      learning from which it was taken and the meaning its use will      convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise instructed.'      Id., at 262\u2014263, 72 S.Ct. at 249\u2014250.\n\n\n65\nThe same principle applies here. The terms and purposes of \u00a7 111 flow from well-defined and familiar law proscribing obstructions of justice, and the provision complements a pattern of state aggravated assault statutes which are uniform and unambiguous in requiring scienter.\n\n\n66\nWe see today the unfortunate consequences of deciding an important question without the benefit of the adversary process.19 In this rush to judgment, settled precedents, such as Ladner v. United States, supra, and Pettibone v. United States, supra, are subverted. Legislative history is ignored or imaginatively reconstructed. Statutory terms are broken from their context and given unnatural readings. On top of it all, the Court disregards two firmly established cannons of statutory construction\u2014'two wise principles this Court has long followed':\n\n\n67\n'First, as we have recently reaffirmed, 'ambiguity concerning      the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of      lenity.' Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 812, 91 S.Ct.      1056, 1059, 28 L.Ed.2d 493 (1971). See also Ladner v. United      States, 358 U.S. 169, 177, 79 S.Ct. 209, 213, 3 L.Ed.2d 199      (1958); Bell v. United States, 349 U.S. 81, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99      L.Ed. 905 (1955); United States v. Five Gambling Devices      etc., 346 U.S. 441, 74 S.Ct. 190, 98 L.Ed. 179 (1953)      (plurality opinion for affirmance) . . .\n\n\n68\n'. . . (S)econd . . .: unless Congress conveys its purpose      clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed      the federal-state balance. Congress has traditionally been      reluctant to define as a federal crime conduct readily      denounced as criminal by the States. . . . In traditionally      sensitive areas, such as legislation affecting the federal      balance, the requirement of clear statement assures that the      legislature has in fact faced, and intended to bring into      issue, the critical matters involved in the judicial      decision.' United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347, 92 S.Ct.      515, 522, 30 L.Ed.2d 488.\n\n\n69\nIf the Congress desires to sweep all assaults upon federal employees into the federal courts, a suitable statute could be easily enacted. I should hope that in so doing the Congress, like every State which has dealt with the matter, would make a distinction in penalty between an assailant who knows the official identity of the victim and one who does not. That result would have a double advantage over the result reached by the Court today. It would be a fair law, and it would be the product of the lawmaking branch of our Government.\n\n\n70\nFor the reasons stated, I believe that before there can be a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111, an assailant must know or have reason to know that the person he assaults is an officer. It follows a fortiori that there can be no criminal conspiracy to violate the statute in the absence of at least equivalent knowledge. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the opinion and judgment of the Court.\n\n\n\n1\n '\u00a7 111. Assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers or employees.\n'Whoever forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with any person designated in section 1114 of this title while engaged in or on account of the performance of his official duties, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\n'Whoever, in the commission of any such acts uses a deadly or dangerous weapon, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.'\nAmong the persons 'designated in section 1114' of 18 U.S.C. is 'any officer or employee . . . of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.'\n\n\n2\n Codefendant Alsondo was also convicted of carrying a firearm unlawfully during the commission of the other felonies, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2).\n\n\n3\n The appeal of the fourth defendant, Farr, was processed separately by the Court of Appeals. A different panel, upon the authority of Alsondo, similarly affirmed the judgment of conviction on the substantive charge but reversed the conspiracy conviction. United States v. Farr, 487 F.2d 1023 (CA2 1973), cert. pending, No. 73\u2014953. The District Court imposed concurrent sentences in Farr's case, and the United States has not sought review here.\n\n\n4\n See, e.g., United States v. Iannelli, 477 F.2d 999, 1002 (CA3 1973), cert. granted on another issue, 417 U.S. 907, 94 S.Ct. 2602, 41 L.Ed.2d 211 (1974); United States v.

Fernandez, 497 F.2d 730, 738\u2014739 (CA9 1974), cert. pending, No. 73\u20146868.\n\n\n5\n The sentence imposed on codefendants Alsondo and Rosa possessed elements of concurrency and the United States did not petition for a writ of certiorari in their cases.\n\n\n6\n The agent opened a closet door in the Manhattan apartment where the sale was to have taken place and observed a man on the floor, bound and gagged. App. 11\u201412.\n\n\n7\n The court charged:\n'In this connection, it is not necessary for the government to prove that the defendants or any of them knew that the persons they were going to assault or impede or resist were federal agents. It's enough, as far as this particular element of the case is concerned, for the government to prove that the defendants agreed and conspired to commit an assault.' Tr. 513.\n'I believe I have previously mentioned to you that the statute does not require that the defendant know either the identity of the person assaulted or imped(ed) or intimidated or that the person assaulted is a federal officer.' Id., at 525.\n\n\n8\n The Second Circuit consistently has so held. See, e.g., United States v. Lombardozzi, 335 F.2d 414, 416, cert. denied, 379 U.S. 914, 85 S.Ct. 261, 13 L.Ed.2d 185 (1964); United States v. Montanaro, 362 F.2d 527, 528, cert. denied, 385 U.S. 920, 87 S.Ct. 233, 17 L.Ed.2d 144 (1966); United States v. Ulan, 421 F.2d 787, 788 (1970).\n\n\n9\n We are content to state the issue this way despite its potential to mislead. Labeling a requirement 'jurisdictional' does not necessarily mean, of course, that the requirement is not an element of the offense Congress intended to describe and to punish. Indeed, a requirement is sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the federal courts for what otherwise are state crimes precisely because it implicates factors that are an appropriate subject for federal concern. With respect to the present case, for example, a mere general policy of deterring assaults would probably prove to be an undesirable or insufficient basis for federal jurisdiction; but where Congress seeks to protect the integrity of federal functions and the safety of federal officers, the interest is sufficient to warrant federal involvement. The significance of labeling a statutory requirement as 'jurisdictional' is not that the requirement is viewed as outside the scope of the evil Congress intended to forestall, but merely that the existence of the fact that confers federal jurisdiction need not be one in the mind of the actor at the time he perpetrates the act made criminal by the federal statute. The question, then, is not whether the requirement is jurisdictional, but whether it is jurisdictional only.\n\n\n10\n Brief for Respondent 6; Tr. of Oral Arg. 19.\n\n\n11\n E.g., Sparks v.

C. 299, 48 Stat. 780.\nA glance at the present \u00a7 1114 reveals how the list of protected federal officers has been greatly expanded. Plainly, some of those now named, viz., 'employee of the Postal Service' and 'employee of the National Park Service,' are not necessarily engaged in the execution of federal law.\n\n\n16\n S.Rep.No.535, 73d Cong.2d Sess.

(1934); 78 Cong.Rec. 8126\u20148127 (1934).\nThe Attorney General's letter was addressed to Senator Ashurst, Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and read in full as follows:\n'My Dear Senator: I wish again to renew the recommendation of this Department that legislation be enacted making it a Federal offense forcibly to resist, impede, or interfere with, or to assault or kill, any official or employee of the United States while engaged in, or on account of, the performance of his official duties. Congress has already made it a Federal offense to assault, resist, etc., officers or employees of the Bureau of Animal Industry of the Department of Agriculture while engaged in or on account of the execution of their duties (sec. 62, C.C.; sec. 118, title 18, U.S.C.); to assault, resist, etc., officers and others of the Customs and Internal Revenue, while engaged in the execution of their duties (sec. 65, C.C.; sec. 121, title 18, U.S.C.); to assault, resist, beat, wound, etc., any officer of the United States, or other person duly authorized, while serving or attempting to serve the process of any court of the United States (sec. 140, C.C.; sec. 245, title 18, U.S.C.); and to assault, resist, etc., immigration officials or employees while engaged in the performance of their duties (sec. 16, Immigration Act of Feb. 5, 1917, c. 29, 39 Stat. 885; Sec. 152, title 8, U.S.C.). Three of the statutes just cited impose an increased penalty when a deadly or dangerous weapon is used in resisting the officer or employee.\n'The need for general legislation of the same character, for the protection of Federal officers and employees other than those specifically embraced in the statutes above cited, becomes increasingly apparent every day. The Federal Government should not be compelled to rely upon the courts of the States, however respectable and well disposed, for the protection of its investigative and law-enforcement personnel; and Congress has recognized this fact at least to the extent indicated by the special acts above cited. This Department has found need for similar legislation for the adequate protection of the special agents of its division of investigation, sev-\neral of whom have been assaulted in the course of a year, while in the performance of their official duties.\n'In these cases resort must usually be had to the local police court, which affords but little relief to us, under the circumstances, in our effort to further the legitimate purposes of the Federal Government. It would seem to be preferable, however, instead of further extending the piecemeal legislation now on the statute books, to enact a broad general statute to embrace all proper cases, both within and outside the scope of existing legislation. Other cases in point are assaults on letter carriers, to cover which the Post Office Department has for several years past sought legislation; and the serious wounding, a couple of years ago, of the warden of the Federal Penitentiary at Leavenworth by escaped convicts outside the Federal jurisdiction. In the latter case it was possible to punish the escaped convicts under Federal law for their escape; but they could not be punished under any Federal law for the shooting of the warden.\n'I have the honor, therefore, to enclose herewith a copy of S.3184, which was introduced at the request of this Department in the Seventy-second Congress and to urge its reintroduction in the present Congress; and to express the hope that it may receive the prompt and serious consideration of your committee.\n'Respectfully,\n'Homer Cummings,\n'Attorney General.'\n\n\n17\n This conclusion is supported by the wording of \u00a7 2 of the 1934 Act (and of the present \u00a7 111), for that section outlawed more than assaults. It made it a criminal offense 'forcibly (to) resist, oppose, impede, intimidate, or interfere with' the named officials while in the performance of their duty. Statutory language of this type had appeared as early as 1866, in \u00a7 6 of the Act of July 18 of that year, 14 Stat. 179, embracing a comprehensive scheme for the prevention of smuggling. The bulk of that statute, to be sure, was concerned with essentially regulatory matters; \u00a7 6, however, proscribed a broad range of actions\u2014beyond simple forcible resistance\u2014that would frustrate effective enforcement of the body of the statute. In employing a similar formulation in 1934, Congress could be presumed to be going beyond mere protection of the safety of federal officers without regard to the integrity of their official functions.\n\n\n18\n Some indication that Congress did not intend to exclude undercover agents from the protection of the statute comes from the inclusion of the term 'Secret Service operative' in the list of protected officials in the 1934 Act. In the 1948 revision, that term was re-\nplaced by 'any officer, or employee of the secret service or of the Bureau of Narcotics.' 62 Stat. 756. That Bureau, in 1948 part of the Treasury, has since been abolished and its functions transferred to the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, the predecessor agency to the present Drug Enforcement Administration. See Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, 38 Fed.Reg. 15932.\nOur Brother STEWART in dissent asserts, post, p. 705-706, that since only state prohibitions of simple assault deter attack on the undercover agent, it is 'nonsense' to hold that Congress concluded that a strict scienter requirement would have given insufficient protection to undercover agents. This argument conveniently ignores \u00a7 1 of the 1934 Act, the homicide prohibition. Certainly prior to 1934 all States outlawed murder, and if the congressional judgment that there was need to prosecute in federal courts assaults upon federal officers regardless of the reach of state law was 'nonsense,' enactment of the homicide prohibition\u2014completely duplicating the coverage of state statutes was legislative fatuity. It is more plausible, we think, to conclude that Congress chose not to entrust to the States sole responsibility for the interdiction of attacks, fatal or not, upon federal law enforcement officials\u2014a matter essential to the morale of all federal law enforcement personnel and central to the efficacy of federal law enforcement activities. The dissent would have us conclude that Congress silently chose to treat assaults and homicides differently; but we have before us one bill with a single legislative history, and we decline to bifurcate our interpretation.\n\n\n19\n See United States v.

As applied to a jurisdictional element of this kind the formulation makes little sense.\n\n\n25\n 'Starting with People v.

Act of May 18, 1934, c. 299, \u00a7 2, 48 Stat. 781.\n\n\n7\n The letter is reprinted by the Court, ante, at 680-681 n. 16.\n\n\n8\n Act of May 18, 1934, c. 299, \u00a7 1, 48 Stat. 780, as amended, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114. The original provision read:\n'Whoever shall kill, as defined in sections 452 and 453 of this title, any United States marshal or deputy United States marshal or person employed to assist a United States marshal or deputy United States marshal, any officer or employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice, post-office inspector, Secret Service operative, any officer or enlisted man of the Coast Guard, any employee of any United States penal or correctional institution, any officer, employee, agent, or other person in the service of the customs or of the internal revenue, any immigrant inspector or any immigration patrol inspector, any officer or employee of the Department of Agriculture or of the Department of the Interior designated by the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior to enforce any Act of Congress for the protection, preservation, or restoration of game and other wid birds and animals, any officer or employee of the National Park Service, any officer or employee of, or assigned to duty in, the field service of the Division of Grazing of the Department of the Interior, or any officer or employee of the Indian field service of the United States, while engaged in the performance of his official duties, or an account of the performance of his official duties, shall be punished as provided under section 454 of this title.' 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 253 (1940 ed.).\nThe list of officers has expanded. It now includes, in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114:\n'any judge of the United States, any United States Attorney, any Assistant United States Attorney, or any United States marshal or deputy marshal or person employed to assist such marshal or deputy marshal, any officer or employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice, any officer or employee of the Postal Service, any officer or employee of the secret service or of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, any officer or enlisted man of the Coast Guard, any officer or employee of any United States penal or correctional institution, any officer, employee or agent of the customs or of the internal revenue or any person assisting him in the execution of his duties, any immigration officer, any officer or employee of the Department of Agriculture or of the Department of the Interior designated by the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior to enforce any Act of Congress for the protection, preservation, or restoration of game and other wild birds and animals, any employee of the Department of Agriculture designated by the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out any law or regulation, or to perform any function in connection with any Federal or State program or any program of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands of the United States, or the District of Columbia, for the control or eradication or prevention of the introduction or dissemination of animal diseases, any officer or employee of the National Park Service, any officer or employee of, or assigned to duty in, the field service of the Bureau of Land Management, any employee of the Bureau of Animal Industry of the Department of Agriculture, or any officer or employee of the Indian field service of the United States, or any officer or employee of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration directed to guard and protect property of the United States under the administration and control of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, any security officer of the Department of State or the Foreign Service, or any officer or employee of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare or of the Department of Labor assigned to perform investigative, inspection, or law enforcement functions.'\n\n\n9\n Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 688.\n\n\n10\n See the Reviser's Note, H.R.Rep.No.304, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., A12 (1947). The minor provision consolidated with \u00a7 254 was 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 118 (1940 ed.), derived from the Act of Mar. 4, 1909, \u00a7 62, 35 Stat. 1100.\n\n\n11\n The Reviser's Note, supra, n. 10, observed that the new \u00a7 111 adopted the penalty provision of \u00a7 254 'as the latest expression of congressional intent.'\n\n\n12\n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 (1926 ed.), derived from the Act of Mar. 4, 1909, \u00a7 276, 35 Stat. 1143.\n\n\n13\n See n. 8, supra. The definitions of, and penalties for, homicides within federal jurisdiction were set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 452\u2014454 (1926 ed.), derived from the Act of Mar. 4, 1909, \u00a7 273, 35 Stat. 1143. This was the same Act which established the definitions of, and graded penalties for, assaults within federal jurisdiction. See n. 11, supra.\n\n\n14\n See n. 8, supra.\n\n\n15\n See n. 7, supra.\n\n\n16\n Comparable language is used in the other federal obstruction-of-justice statutes, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1501\u20141505, 1507, 1509, 1752, 2231.\n\n\n17\n Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 245 (1926 ed.), mentioned in the Attorney General's letter, supra, n. 7, had an express scienter requirement. Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 121 (1926 ed.), also mentioned, had long been judicially construed to require Scienter. E.g., Gay v. United States, 5 Cir., 12 F.2d 433, 434\u2014435.\n\n\n18\n As noted earlier, the 1934 version of the statute, proscribed assault on a federal officer only when perpetrated 'on account of the performance of his official duties.' (Emphasis added.) See n. 6, supra. By contrast, the other acts in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 (1940 ed.), were proscribed so long as the officer was 'engaged in the performance of his official duties.' The mental element for assault was more, not less, stringent than for the other acts. In the 1948 recodification, this asymmetry was eliminated, to allow consolidation of the 1934 statute with a minor provision enacted in 1909. Now each of the acts is proscribed if committed upon an officer engaged in performance of his duties or if committed 'on account' of his performance of duty. It would be utterly farfetched to suggest that this technical alteration, aiming toward symmetry, was intended to create a difference concerning the scienter requirement as between assaults and the other acts listed with it in \u00a7 111.\n\n\n19\n The Court seems to be emboldened by the rough consensus among the Courts of Appeals that the victim-status element in \u00a7 111 is jurisdictional only. Ante, p. 677, n. 12. But this consensus is both very recent and very shaky. The federal courts continue to complain that the 'substantial number of prosecutions under this statute' has resulted in 'disagreement in the cases' regarding the scienter question. United States v. Perkins, 488 F.2d 652, 654; see also United States v. Chunn, 347 F.2d 717, 721. The fact is that until 1964, the federal courts were virtually unanimous the other way\u2014that is, in holding or assuming that proof of scienter was required for the offense of obstructing or assaulting a federal officer. E.g., Hall v. United States, 235 F.2d 248; Carter v. United States, 231 F.2d 232, cert. denied, 351 U.S. 984, 76 S.Ct. 1052, 100 L.Ed. 1498; Owens v. United States, 201 F.2d 749; Hargett v. United States, 183 F.2d 859; Sparks v. United States, 90 F.2d 61; United States v. Bell, 219 F.Supp. 260; United States v. Page, 277 F. 459; United States v. Taylor, 57 F. 391; United States v. Miller, 17 F.R.D. 486. The turning point was United States v. Lombardozzi, 335 F.2d 414, cert. denied, 379 U.S. 914, 85 S.Ct. 261, 13 L.Ed.2d 185, which eliminated the scienter requirement on the historically erroneous ground that Congress had enacted the provision merely to transfer to the federal courts a class of assault cases out from under the untrustworthy state courts and prosecutors' offices. Lombardozzi was promptly followed, with little or no fresh analysis, in nearly every Circuit. Just as promptly, however, second thoughts have emerged. The Ninth Circuit has recently acknowledged that Lombardozzi was unsoundly premised. United States v. Fernandez, 497 F.2d, at 736 739. In her concurring opinion in Fernandez, Judge Hufstedler strongly argued the desirability of re-examining the entire question, id., at 740\u2014747. A number of Courts of Appeals have felt constrained to limit Lombardozzi by making distinctions between the scienter requirement for assault and for the other acts proscribed by \u00a7 111, distinctions directly at odds with the history of the provisions and with Ladner v. United States, 358 U.S. 169, 176, 79 S.Ct. 209, 213. See, e.g., United States v. Perkins, supra, 488 F.2d, at 654\u2014655; United States v. Ulan, 421 F.2d 787, 789\u2014790; United States v. Goodwin, 440 F.2d 1152, at 1156; United States v. Young, 464 F.2d 160, 163. Having acted hastily, the Courts of Appeals are only now appreciating the need for reconsideration. Acting with even greater haste, the Court today bids fair to insure that the issue will be forever sealed.\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"397 U.S. 790\n90 S.Ct. 1474\n25 L.Ed.2d 785\nCharles Lee PARKER, Petitioner,v.State of NORTH CAROLINA.  Robert M. BRADY, Petitioner,  v.  UNITED STATES.\nNos. 268, 270.\nSupreme Court of the United States\nMay 4, 1970\n\nNorman B. Smith, Greensboro, N.C., for petitioner.\nJacob L. Safron, Raleigh, N.C., for respondent.\nMr. Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nAt about 11 p.m. on July 16, 1964, petitioner was arrested after entering the yard of a home where a burglary and rape had been committed four days earlier. Petitioner, a Negro boy then 15 years old, was taken to the police station and was questioned for one or two hours. After the questioning, petitioner was placed alone in a dimly lit cell for the remainder of the night. Although petitioner refused to give even his name during the questioning, the police eventually determined his identity and notified petitioner's mother the next day between 3:30 and 4:30 a.m. That morning, petitioner was given drinking water and was then questioned by the police; petitioner almost immediately confessed to the burglary and rape committed several days earlier at the house where he had been arrested. Shortly thereafter, an attorney retained by petitioner's mother came to the police station and talked with petitioner. Petitioner told the attorney that the confession had not been prompted by threats or promises and that he had not been frightened when he made the statement to the police.\n\n\n2\nPetitioner was indicted for first-degree burglary, an offense punishable by death under North Carolina law.1 Petitioner's retained attorney discussed with petitioner and his mother the nature and seriousness of the charge. In due course, petitioner and his mother signed written statements authorizing the entry of a plea of guilty. Both petioner and his mother were aware at the time they signed the authorization for the guilty plea that, if the plea was accepted, petitioner would receive the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.2 The prosecutor and the trial judge accepted the plea. In accepting the plea on August 18, 1964, the trial court asked the petitioner if the plea was made in response to any promise or threat and petitioner answered in the negative; petitioner affirmed that he tendered the plea 'freely without any fear or compulsion.'3 Upon acceptance of the plea, petitioner was sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\n\n3\nIn 1967, petitioner, assisted by counsel, filed a petition under the North Carolina Post-Conviction Hearing Act4 to obtain relief from his conviction. In his petition, Parker urged that his plea of guilty was the product of a coerced confession and that the indictment to which he pleaded was invalid because members of his race had been systematically excluded from the grand jury which returned the indictment. After a hearing, the Superior Court of Halifax County found that there was no deliberate exclusion of Negroes from the grand jury that indicted petitioner and that petitioner had freely admitted his guilt and had pleaded guilty 'freely, voluntarily, without threat, coercion or duress * * *.' The Court of Appeals of North Carolina, the highest state court in which petitioner could seek review,5 affirmed the conviction after reviewing not only the claims presented to the lower court but also the additional assertion by petitioner that his guilty plea was involuntary because North Carolina statutes at that time allowed a defendant to escape the possibility of a death penalty on a capital charge by pleading guilty to that charge. 2 N.C.App. 27, 162 S.E.2d 526 (1968). We granted certiorari, 395 U.S. 974, 89 S.Ct. 2136, 23 L.Ed.2d 764 (1969), to consider petitioner's federal constitutional claims. For the reasons presented below, we affirm.\n\n\n4\n* Parker would have us hold his guilty plea involuntary and therefore invalid for two reasons: first, because it was induced by a North Carolina statute providing a maximum penalty in the event of a plea of guilty lower than the penalty authorized after a verdict of guilty by a jury; and, second, because the plea was the product of a coerced confession given to the police shortly after petitioner was arrested. Neither reason is sufficient to warrant setting aside Parker's plea.\n\n\n5\nIt may be that under United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570, 88 S.Ct. 1209, 20 L.Ed.2d 138 (1968), it was unconstitutional to impose the death penalty under the statutory framework which existed in North Carolina at the time of Parker's plea.6 Even so, we determined in Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747, that an otherwise valid plea is not involuntary because induced by the defendant's desire to limit the possible maximum penalty to less than that authorized if there is a jury trial. In this respect we see nothing to distinguish Parker's case from Brady's.\n\n\n6\nNor can we accept the claim that the plea was infirm because it was the product of a coerced confession. According to Parker's testimony at the post-conviction hearing, he was denied food and water, promised unspecified help if he confessed, and denied counsel's advice when he requested it. In the record, however, was an abundance of evidence contradicting Parker's claim of coercion: Parker's statements to his attorney soon after his interrogation that there had been no threats or promises and that he had not been afraid, his similar declarations in his sworn statement authorizing his plea,7 his answers to the trial judge at the time the plea was accepted,8 and his failure to complain of any mistreatment by the police until many months after he began serving his sentence. The North Carolina courts accordingly refused to credit his testimony and concluded that his confession was a free and voluntary act.\n\n\n7\nWe would in any event be reluctant to question the judgment of the state courts in this respect; but we need not evaluate the voluntariness of petitioner's confession since even if the confession should have been found involuntary, we cannot believe that the alleged conduct of the police during the interrogation period was of such a nature or had such enduring effect as to make involuntary a plea of guilty entered over a month later. Parker soon hadd food and water, the lack of counsel was immediately remedied, and there was ample opportunity to consider the significance of the alleged promises. After the allegedly coercive interrogation, there were no threats, misrepresentations, promises, or other improper acts by the State. Parker had the advice of retained counsel and of his family for the month before he pleaded. The connection, if any, between Parker's confession and his plea of guilty had 'become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint.' Nardone v. United States, 308 U.S. 338, 341, 60 S.Ct. 266, 268, 267\u2014268, 84 L.Ed. 307 (1939); Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 491, 83 S.Ct. 407, 419, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). As far as this record reveals, the guilty plea was Parker's free and voluntary act, the product of his own choice, just as he affirmed it was when the plea was entered in open court.\n\nII\n\n8\nOn the assumption that Parker's confession was inadmissible, there remains the question whether his plea, even if voluntary, was unintelligently made because his counsel mistakenly thought his confession was admissible. As we understand it, Parker's position necessarily implies that his decision to plead rested on the strength of the case against him: absent the confession, his chances of acquittal were good and he would have chosen to stand trial; but given the confession, the evidence was too strong and it was to his advantage to plea guilty and limit the possible penalty to life imprisonment.9 On this assumption, had Parker and his counsel thought the confession inadmissible, there would have been a plea of not guilty and a trial to a jury. But counsel apparently deemed the confession admissible and his advice to plead guilty was followed by his client. Parker now considers his confession involuntary and inadmissible. The import of this claim is that he suffered from bad advice and that had he been correctly counseled he would have gone to trial rather than enter a guilty plea. He suggests that he is entitled to plead again, a suggestion that we reject.\n\n\n9\nFor the reasons set out in McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763, even if Parker's counsel was wrong in his assessment of Parker's confession, it does not follow that his error was sufficient to render the plea unintelligent and entitle Parker to disavow his admission in open court that he committed the offense with which he was charged.10 Based on the facts of record relating to Parker's confession and guilty plea, which we have previously detailed, we think the advice he received was well within the range of competence required of attorneys representing defendants in criminal cases. Parker's plea of guilty was an intelligent plea not open to attack on the grounds that counsel misjudged the admissibility of Parker's confession.\n\nIII\n\n10\nWe also have before us the question whether the indictment to which Parker pleaded is invalid because members of his race were allegedly systematically excluded from the grand jury which returned the indictment. The North Carolina Court of Appeals refused to consider the claim since under North Carolina law an objection to the composition of the grand jury must be raised by motion to quash the indictment prior to the entry of the guilty plea.11 Because Parker had failed to raise his objection in timely fashion, relief was unavailable. This state rule of practice would constitute an adequate state ground precluding our reaching the grand jury issue if this case were here on direct review. See Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 428\u2014429, 83 S.Ct. 822, 843\u2014844, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963). We are under similar constraint when asked to review a state court decision holding that the same rule of practice requires denial of collateral relief. Ibid. Whether the question of racial exclusion in the selection of the grand jury is open in a federal habeas corpus action we need not decide. Compare United States ex rel. Goldsby v. Harpole, 263 F.2d 71 (C.A.2th Cir.), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 838 and 850, 80 S.Ct. 58 and 109, 4 L.Ed.2d 78 (1959), with Labat v. Bennett, 365 F.2d 698 (C.A.5th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 991, 87 S.Ct. 1303, 18 L.Ed.2d 334 (1967). See also McNeil v. North Carolina, 368 F.2d 313 (C.A.4th Cir. 1966).\n\n\n11\nThe North Carolina Court of Appeals correctly concluded that petitioner's plea of guilty was intelligent and voluntary, and there was an adequate basis in North Carolina procedural law for the North Carolina Court of Appeals' refusal to consider the claim of racial exclusion in the composition of the grand jury that indicted petitioner.\n\n\n12\nAffirmed.\n\n\n13\nMr. Justice BLACK, concurring.\n\n\n14\nI concur in the judgment of affirmance and also concur in the opinion except that part on p. 1461 stating, 'It may be that under United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570, 88 S.Ct. 1209, 20 L.Ed.2d 138 (1968), it was unconstitutional to impose the death penalty under the statutory framework which existed in North Carolina at the time of Parker's plea.'\n\n\n15\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting in No. 268, and concurring in the result in No. 270.\n\n\n16\nIn United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570, 88 S.Ct. 1209, 20 L.Ed.2d 138 (1968), we held that the operative effect of the capital punishment provisions of the Federal Kidnaping Act was unconstitutionally 'to discourage assertion of the Fifth Amendment right not to plead guilty and to deter exercise of the Sixth Amendment right to demand a jury trial.' 390 U.S., at 581, 88 S.Ct., at 1216. The petitioners in these cases claim that they were the victims of the very vices we condemned in Jackson. Yet the Court paradoxically holds that each of the petitioners must be denied relief even if his allegations are substantiated.1 Indeed, the Court apparently holds that never, except perhaps in highly unrealistic hypothetical situations, will the constitutional defects identified in Jackson vitiate a guilty plea.2 In so holding, the Court seriously undermines the rational underpinnings of Jackson and departs broadly from our prior approach to the determination of the voluntariness of guilty pleas and also confessions. This is merely one manifestation of a design to insulate all guilty pleas from subsequent attack no matter what influences induced them. I cannot acquiesce in this wholesale retreat from the sound principles to which we have previously adhered.\n\n\n17\n* The Court properly notes the grave consequences for a defendant that attach to his plea of guilty; for the plea constitutes a simultaneous surrender of numerous constitutional rights, including the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination and the right to a trial by jury, with all of its attendant safeguards. McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 1170, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969); Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 242\u2014244, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1711\u20141713, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969). Indeed, we have pointed out that a guilty plea is more serious than a confession because it is tantamount to a conviction. Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220, 223, 47 S.Ct. 582, 583, 71 L.Ed. 1009 (1927). Accordingly, we have insisted that a guilty plea, like any surrender of fundamental constitutional rights, reflect the unfettered choice of the defendant. See Botkin v. Alabama, supra; Machibroda v. United States 368 U.S. 487, 493, 182 S.Ct. 510, 513, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962). In deciding whether any illicit pressures have been brought to bear on a defendant to induce a guilty plea, courts have traditionally inquired whether it was made 'voluntarily' and 'intelligently' with full understanding and appreciation of the consequences.\n\n\n18\nThe concept of 'voluntariness' contains an ambiguous element, accentuated by the Court's opinions in these cases, because the concept has been employed to analyze a variety of pressures to surrender constitutional rights, which are not all equally coercive or obvious in their coercive effect. In some cases where an 'involuntary' surrender has been found, the physical or psychological tactics employed exerted so great an influence upon the accused that it could accurately be said that his will was literally overborne or completely dominated by his interrogators, who rendered him incapable of rationally weighing the legal alternatives open to him.3\n\n\n19\nThere is some intimation in the Court's opinions in the instant cases that, at least with respect to guilty pleas, 'involuntariness' covers only the narrow class of cases in which the defendant's will has been literally overborne. At other points, however, the Court apparently recognizes that the term 'involuntary' has traditionally been applied to situations in which an individual, while perfectly capable of rational choice, has been confronted with factors that the government may not constitutionally inject into the decision-making process. For example, in Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493, 87 S.Ct. 616, 17 L.Ed.2d 562 (1967), we held a surrender of the self-incrimination privilege to be involuntary when an individual was presented by the government with the possibility of discharge from his employment if he invoked the privilege. So, also, it has long been held that certain promises of leniency or threats of harsh treatment by the trial judge or the prosecutor unfairly burden or intrude upon the defendant's decision-making process. Even though the defendant is not necessarily rendered incapable of rational choice, his guilty plea nonetheless may be invalid.4\n\n\n20\nThus the legal concept of 'involuntariness' has not been narrowly confined but refers to a surrender of constitutional rights influenced by considerations that the government cannot properly introduce. The critical question that divides the Court is what constitutes an impermissible factor, or, more narrowly in the context of these cases, whether the threat of the imposition of an unconstitutional death penalty is such a factor.5\n\n\n21\nEven after the various meanings of 'involuntary' have been identified, application of voluntariness criteria in particular circumstances remains an elusory process because it entails judicial evaluation of the effect of particular external stimuli upon the state of mind of the accused. See Haley v. Ohio, 332 U.S. 596, 603, 68 S.Ct. 302, 305, 92 L.Ed. 224 (1948) (separate opinion of Frankfurter, J). Nevertheless, we have consistently taken great pains to insulate the accused from the more obvious and oppressive forms of physical coercion. Beyond this, in the analogous area of coerced confessions, for example, it has long been recognized that various psychological devices, some of a very subtle and sophisticated nature, may be employed to induce statements. Such influences have been condemned by this Court.6 Thus, a confession is not voluntary merely because it is the 'product of a sentient choice,' if it does not reflect a free exercise of the defendant's will. Id., at 606, 68 S.C., at 307. Indeed, as the Court recognizes, we held in an early case that the concept of 'voluntariness' requires that a confession 'not be extracted by any sort of threats or violence, nor obtained by any direct or implied promises, however slight, nor by the exertion of any improper influence.' Bram v. United States, 168 U.S. 532, 542\u2014543, 18 S.Ct. 183, 187, 42 L.Ed. 568 (1897). More recently, we held in Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964), that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee to every person the right 'to remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will, and to suffer no penalty * * * for such silence.' 378 U.S., at 8, 84 S.Ct., at 1493. Cf. Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493, 87 S.Ct. 616 (1967).\n\n\n22\nThe Court's answer to the stringent criterion of voluntariness imposed by Bram and subsequent cases is that the availability of counsel to an accused effectively offsets the illicit influence upon him that threats or promises by the government may impose. Of course, the presence of counsel is a factor to be taken into account in any overall evaluation of the voluntariness of a confession or a guilty plea. However, it hardly follows that the support provided by counsel is sufficient by itself to insulate the accused from the effect of any threat or promise by the government.\n\n\n23\nIt has frequently been held, for example, that a guilty plea induced by threats or promises by the trial judge is invalid because of the risk that the trial judge's impartiality will be compromised and because of the inherently unequal bargaining power of the judge and the accused.7 The assistance of counsel in this situation, of course, may improve a defendant's bargaining ability, but it does not alter the underlying inequality of power. Significantly, the Court explicitly refrains from expressing its views on this issue. (397 U.S., at 751, 90 S.Ct., at 1470 n. 8.) This is an unfortunate omission, for judicial promises of leniency in return for a guilty plea provide a useful analogy to what has occurred in the instant cases. Here, the government has promised the accused, through the legislature, that he will receive a substantially reduced sentence if he pleads guilty. In fact, the legislature has simultaneously threatened the accused with the ultimate penalty\u2014death\u2014if he insists upon a jury trial and has promised a penalty no greater than life imprisonment if he pleads guilty.8\n\n\n24\nIt was precisely this statutorily imposed dilemma that we identified in Jackson as having the 'inevitable effect' of discouraging assertion of the right not to plead guilty and to demand a jury trial. As recognized in Jackson, it is inconceivable that this sort of capital penalty scheme will not have a major impact upon the decisions of many defendants to plead guilty. In any particular case, therefore, the influence of this unconstitutional factor must necessarily be given weight in determining the voluntariness of a plea.9\n\n\n25\nTo be sure, we said in Jackson that 'the fact that the Federal Kidnaping Act tends to discourage defendants from insisting upon their innocence and demanding trial by jury hardly implied that every defendant who enters a guilty plea to a charge under the Act does so involuntarily.'10 390 U.S., at 583, 88 S.Ct., at 1217. But that statement merely emphasized the obvious fact that it is perfectly possible that a defendant pleaded guilty for reasons entirely unrelated to the penalty scheme, for example, because his guilt was clear or because he desired to spare himself and his family 'the spectacle and expense of protracted courtroom proceedings.' 390 U.S., at 584, 88 S.Ct., at 1217. The converse, however, is equally clear: not every defendant who pleaded guilty under the Act did so voluntarily, that is, uninfluenced by the highly coercive character of the penalty scheme. This much is merely the teaching of Jackson.\n\n\n26\nThe Court has elected to deny this latter aspect of Jackson, but in doing so it undermines the rationale on which Jackson was decided. In Jackson we invalidated the death penalty provision of the Kidnaping Act because the Act's penalty scheme as a whole encouraged guilty pleas and waivers of jury trial, and in the circumstances of particular cases this improper influence could render pleas and waivers constitutionally involuntary. Today the Court appears to distinguish sharply between a guilty plea that has been 'encouraged' by the penalty scheme and one that has been entered 'involuntarily.' However, if the influence of the penalty scheme can never render a plea involuntary, it is difficult to understand why in Jackson we took the extraordinary step of invalidating part of that scheme. Apparently in the Court's view, we invalidated the death penalty in Jackson because it 'encouraged' pleas that are perfectly valid despite the encouragement. Rarely, if ever, have we overturned an Act of Congress for what proves to be so frivolous a reason. Moreover, the Court's present covert rejection of the Jackson rationale, together with its acceptance of the result in Jackson, leads to a striking anomaly. Since the death penalty provision of the Kidnaping Act remains void, those who resisted the pressures identified in Jackson and after a jury trial were sentenced to death receive relief, but those who succumbed to the same pressures and were induced to surrender their constitutional rights are left without any remedy at all. Where the penalty scheme failed to produce its unconstitutional effect, the intended victims obtain relief; where it succeeded, the real victims have none. Thus the Court puts a premium on strength of will and invulnerability to pressure at the cost of constitutional rights.\n\n\n27\nOf course, whether in a given case the penalty scheme has actually exercised its pernicious influence so as to make a guilty plea involuntary can be decided only by consideration of the factors that actually motivated the defendant to enter his plea. If a particular defendant can demonstrate that the death penalty scheme exercised a significant influence upon his decision to plead guilty, then, under Jackson, he is entitled to reversal of the conviction based upon his illicitly produced plea.\n\n\n28\nThe Court attempts to submerge the issue of voluntariness of a plea under an unconstitutional capital punishment scheme in a general discussion of the pressures upon defendants to plead guilty which are said to arise from, inter alia, the venerable institution of plea bargaining. The argument appears to reduce to this: because the accused cannot be insulated from all inducements to plead guilty, it follows that he should be shielded from none.\n\n\n29\nThe principal flaw in the Court's discourse on plea bargaining, however, is that it is, at best, only marginally relevant to the precise issues before us. There are critical distinctions between plea bargaining as commonly practiced and the situation presently under consideration\u2014distinctions which, in constitutional terms, make a difference. Thus, whatever the merit, if any, of the constitutional objections to plea bargaining generally,11 those issues are not presently before us.\n\n\n30\nWe are dealing here with the legislative imposition of a markedly more severe penalty if a defendant asserts his right to a jury trial and a concomitant legislative promise of leniency if he pleads guilty. This is very different from the give-and-take negotiation common in plea bargaining between the prosecution and defense, which arguably possess relatively equal bargaining power.12 No such flexibility is built into the capital penalty scheme where the government's harsh terms with respect to punishment are stated in unalterable form.\n\n\n31\nFurthermore, the legislatively ordained penalty scheme may affect any defendant, even one with respect to whom plea bargaining is wholly inappropriate because his guilt is uncertain.13 Thus the penalty scheme presents a clear danger that the innocent, or those not clearly guilty, or those who insist upon their innocence, will be induced nevertheless to plead guilty. This hazard necessitates particularly sensitive scrutiny of the voluntariness of guilty pleas entered under this type of death penalty scheme.\n\n\n32\nThe penalty schemes involved here are also distinguishable from most plea bargaining because they involve the imposition of death\u2014the most severe and awesome penalty known to our law. This Court has recognized that capital cases are treated differently in some respects from noncapital cases. See, e.g., Williams v. Georgia, 349 U.S. 375, 391, 75 S.Ct. 814, 823, 99 L.Ed. 1161 (1955). We have identified the threat of a death penalty as a factor to be given considerable weight in determining whether a defendant has deliberately waived his constitutional rights. Thus, for example, in Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957), it was contended that a defendant initially convicted of second-degree murder upon an indictment charging first-degree murder waived his double-jeopardy objections to a second trial for murder in the first degree by taking a successful appeal. We rejected this argument, observing that\n\n\n33\n'a defendant faced with such a 'choice' takes a 'desperate      chance' in securing the reversal of the erroneous conviction.      The law should not, and in our judgment does not, place the      defendant in such an incredible dilemma.' 355 U.S., at 193,      78 S.Ct., at 227.\n\n\n34\nSo, also, in Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963), it was argued that the petitioner had deliberately failed to seek redress through appeal of his conviction within the state appellate process and thus was not entitled to federal habeas corpus relief. Noting that the petitioner had been confronted with the 'grisly choice' of forgoing his appellate rights or facing a possible death sentence if his appeal were successful, we held that the failure to seek state appellate review, motivated by fear of the death penalty, could not be interposed to bar the federal habeas corpus remedy.14 372 U.S., at 438\u2014440, 83 S.Ct., at 848\u2014850.\n\n\n35\nFinally, under our express holding in Jackson, the death penalty in no circumstances could have been constitutionally imposed upon these defendants.15 If they had been aware of the constitutional deficiency in the penalty scheme, they might well have decided to assert their right to a jury trial since the maximum penalty that could have been imposed after an unfavorable jury verdict was life imprisonment. It is in this narrow context, involving a legislatively mandated unconstitutional death penalty scheme, that the defendant should be relieved of the rigid finality of his plea if he demonstrates that it was a consequence of the unconstitutional scheme.16\n\nII\n\n36\nTurning to the facts of these particular cases, I consider first the contention that the North Carolina capital punishment scheme under which Parker was convicted (90 S.Ct., at 1460, nn. 1, 2), was constitutionally deficient under the standards set forth in Jackson. Although the Court assumes arguendo that the North Carolina statutes were indistinguishable from the Federal Kidnaping Act, this conclusion is, in my view, inescapable. Under North Carolina law as it formerly existed, the capital defendant had but two choices: he could demand a jury trial and thereby risk the imposition of the death penalty, or he could absolutely avoid that possibility by pleading guilty.17 If anything, the defect in the North Carolina statutory scheme was more serious than that in the statute considered in Jackson, for under the Kidnaping Act a defendant at least had a potential opportunity to avoid the death penalty and to have his guilt determined in a bench trial. Therefore, Parker is entitled to relief is he can demonstrate that the unconstitutional capital punishment scheme was a significant factor in his decision to plead guilty.\n\n\n37\nParker comes here after denial of state post-conviction relief. The North Carolina courts have consistently taken the position that United States v. Jackson has no applicability to the former North Carolina capital punishment scheme.18 Thus, the merits of Parker's contention that his plea was motivated by the unconstitutional death penalty have not been considered by the state courts. I would, therefore, reverse the judgment of the North Carolina Court of Appeals and remand the Parker case to that court for proceedings not inconsistent with the principles elaborated herein.19\n\nIII\n\n38\nIn 1959 Brady was indicted under the Federal Kidnaping Act. The indictment alleged that the kidnaped person had 'not been liberated unharmed.' Thus Brady was subject to a potential sentence of death if he demanded a jury trial.20 He ultimately elected to plead guilty, a decision that followed a similar action by his codefendant. Subsequently Brady was sentenced to 50 years' imprisonment. There exists in the record substantial evidence that Brady decided to plead guilty because the similar plea decision of his codefendant seriously undermined his own defense. It is also true that Brady was under the impression that the maximum penalty that could be imposed following a jury trial was the death sentence.\n\n\n39\nA hearing was held pursuant to Brady's motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate his sentence, at which Brady, his codefendant, and their trial attorneys testified. This hearing was completed after the District Court had decided the Jackson case, but before this Court had spoken in the matter. The District Judge took the position that the death penalty provision of the Federal Kidnaping Act was constitutional. In this respect, of course, he erred. However, the District Judge also concluded that Brady 'decided to plead guilty when he learned that his co-defendant was going to plead guilty' and that this decision was not induced or influenced improperly by anything the trial judge or his attorney had told him. The District Court further found that 'the plea of guilty was made by (Brady) by reason of other matters and not by reason of (the Kidnaping Act).'\n\n\n40\nThe decision in the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit was rendered after our decision in Jackson. The Court of Appeals correctly pointed out that not every plea entered under the Federal Kidnaping Act is necessarily invalid and ultimately concluded that '(t)he finding of the trial court that the guilty plea was not made because of the statute but because of other matters is supported by substantial evidence and is binding on us.' 404 F.2d 601, 602.\n\n\n41\nAn independent examination of the record in the instant case convinces me that the conclusions of the lower courts are not clearly erroneous. Although Brady was aware that he faced a possible death sentence, there is no evidence that this factor alone played a significant role in his decision to enter a guilty plea. Rather, there is considerable evidence, which the District Court credited, that Brady's plea was triggered by the confession and plea decision of his codefendant and not by any substantial fear of the death penalty. Moreover, Brady's position is dependent in large measure upon his own assertions, years after the fact, that his plea was motivated by fear of the death penalty and thus rests largely upon his own credibility. For example, there is no indication, contemporaneous with the entry of the guilty plea, that Brady thought he was innocent and was pleading guilty merely to avoid possible execution. Furthermore, Brady's plea was accepted by a trial judge who manifested some sensitivity to the seriousness of a guilty plea and questioned Brady at length concerning his guilt and the voluntariness of the plea before it was finally accepted.\n\n\n42\nIn view of the foregoing. I concur in the result reached by the Court in the Brady case.\n\n\n\n1\n In North Carolina the crime of first-degree burglary is defined as follows:\n'There shall be two degrees in the crime of burglary as defined at the common law. If the crime be committed in a dwelling house, or in a room used as a sleeping apartment in any building, and any person is in the actual occupation of any part of said dwelling house or sleeping apartment at the time of the commission of such crime, it shall be burglary in the first degree.' N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14\u201451 (1969 Repl. vol.).\nThe punishment for first-degree burglary is death unless the jury recommends that the penalty be life imprisonment:\n'Any person convicted, according to due course of law, of the crime of burglary in the first degree shall suffer death: Provided, if the jury when rendering its verdict in open court shall so recommend, the punishment shall be imprisonment for life in the State's prison, and the court shall so instruct the jury.' N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14\u201452 (1969 Repl. vol.).\n\n\n2\n At the time petitioner's plea was entered, North Carolina law provided that if a plea of guilty to first-degree burglary was accepted the punishment would be life imprisonment rather than death:\n'(a) Any person, when charged in a bill of indictment with the felony of murder in the first degree, or burglary in the first degree, or arson, or rape, when represented by counsel, whether employed by the defendant or appointed by the court * * *, may, after arraignment, tender in writing, signed by such person and his counsel, a plea of guilty of such crime; and the State, with the approval of the court, may accept such plea. Upon rejection of such plea, the trial shall be upon the defendant's plea of not guilty, and such tender shall have no legal significance whatever.\n'(b) In the event such plea is accepted, the tender and acceptance thereof shall have the effect of a jury verdict of guilty of the crime charged with recommendation by the jury in open court that the punishment shall be imprisonment for life in the State's prison; and thereupon, the court shall pronounce judgment that the defendant be imprisoned for life in the State's prison.' N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15\u2014162.1 (1965 Repl. vol.), repealed, effective March 25, 1969, N.C.Laws 1969, c. 117.\n\n\n3\n The Court: 'Has anybody made you any promise or forced you in any way to make this plea?'\nPetitioner: 'No, sir.'\nThe Court: 'Did you sign this plea freely without any fear or compulsion?'\nPetitioner: 'Yes, sir.'\nThe Court: 'Has any person promised you anything if you do this?'\nPetitioner: 'No, sir.' App. 46.\n\n\n4\n N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 15\u2014217 to 15\u2014222 (Supp.1969).\n\n\n5\n N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7A\u201428 (1969 Repl. vol.).\n\n\n6\n The statute authorizing guilty pleas to capital charges was repealed, effective March 25, 1969. See n. 2, supra. As a result of the repeal, a person who is charged with a capital offense and who is not allowed to plead to a lesser charge must apparently face a jury trial and a death penalty upon a verdict of guilty unless the jury recommends life imprisonment.\n\n\n7\n In his affidavit authorizing the entry of a plea of guilty Parker stated that: 'I have not been threatened or abused in any manner by any person and no promises have been made to me if I plead guilty to any charge.'\n\n\n8\n See n. 3, supra.\n\n\n9\n The North Carolina Court of Appeals noted that the prosecution may have had strong evidence against Parker in addition to the confession and that if other strong evidence existed the guilty plea could not be viewed as the product of the confession, 2 N.C.App. 27, 32, 162 S.E.2d 526, 529 (1968).\n\n\n10\n We find nothing in the record raising any doubts about the integrity of petitioner's admission. The following appears in the findings entered after the post-conviction hearing in the state trial court:\n'(S)aid petitioner defendant freely admitted to his attorney his guilt of the crime with which he was charged, in fact said petitioner defendant Charles Lee Parker, upon cross examination at this hearing, and the Court so finds as a fact, has freely admitted his guilt of the capital offense of burglary and rape. * * *'\n\n\n11\n 'All exceptions to grand jurors on account of their disqualifications shall be taken before the petit jury is sworn and impaneled to try the issue, by motion to quash the indictment, and if not taken at that time shall be deemed to be waived. * * *' N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 9\u201423 (1969 Repl. vol.). See State v. Rorie, 258 N.C. 162, 128 S.E.2d 229 (1962). Under North Carolina law, a guilty plea does not waive objections to racial exclusion in the selection of the grand jury if, before the plea of guilty, the defendant raises his objection in a motion to quash the indictment. State v. Covington, 258 N.C. 501, 128 S.E.2d 827 (1963).\n\n\n1\n The present discussion, while containing occasional references to the Federal Kidnaping Act, is equally applicable to Parker, for, as I shall demonstrate in Part II of this opinion, there is no pertinent distinction between the Kidnaping Act and the North Carolina statutes under which Parker was convicted.\n\n\n2\n The precise contours of the Court's theory, developed principally in Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747, are unclear. The Court initially states that 'the possibility of a heavier sentence following a guilty verdict after a trial' is one of the 'relevant circumstances' to be taken into account in determining the voluntariness of the guilty plea. At 749, 90 S.Ct., at 1469. Subsequently, however, after discussing its notion of voluntariness, the Court concludes that 'a plea of guilty is not invalid merely because entered to avoid the possibility of a death penalty.' At 755, 90 S.Ct., at 1472. Elsewhere the Court states that 'there (is no) evidence that Brady was so gripped by fear of the death penalty or hope of leniency that the did not or could not, with the help of counsel, rationally weigh the advantages of going to trial against the advantages of pleading guilty.' At 750, 90 S.Ct., at 1470. If the latter is what the Court deems to be the criterion of voluntariness, the holding is totally without precedent, for it has never been thought that an individual's mental state must border on temporary insanity before his confession or guilty plea can be found 'involuntary.'\n\n\n3\n See, e.g., Pennsylvania ex rel. Herman v. Claudy, 350 U.S. 116, 76 S.Ct. 223, 100 L.Ed. 126 (1956); Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227, 60 S.Ct. 472, 84 L.Ed. 716 (1940); Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278, 56 S.Ct. 461, 80 L.Ed. 682 (1936).\n\n\n4\n See, e.g., Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 82 S.Ct. 510 (1962); cases cited, n. 7, infra.\n\n\n5\n A further latent ambiguity in the concept of 'voluntariness' arises from the notion that a plea is involuntary only if it is the product of coercion directly applied to the accused at the time his plea is entered, and hence that a plea cannot be tainted by prior unconstitutional action on the part of the government. With this view I am in disagreement for reasons more fully set forth in my dissenting opinion in McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 775, 90 S.Ct. 1451, 25 L.Ed.2d 776, decided this day.\n\n\n6\n See, e.g., Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966); Haynes v. Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 10 L.Ed.2d 513 (1963); Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U.S. 534, 81 S.Ct. 735, 5 L.Ed.2d 760 (1961); Spano v. New York, 360 U.S. 315, 79 S.Ct. 1202, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265 (1959); Haley v. Ohio, 332 U.S. 596, 68 S.Ct. 302 (1948).\n\n\n7\n See, e.g., Scott v. United States, 135 U.S.App.D.C. 377, 419 F.2d 264 (1969); United States ex rel. McGrath v. LaVallee, 319 F.2d 308 (C.A.2d Cir. 1963); Exuziere v. United States, 249 F.2d 293 (C.A.10th Cir. 1957); United States ex rel. Elksnis v. Gilligan, 256 F.Supp. 244 (D.C.S.D.N.Y.1966); United States v. Tateo, 214 F.Supp. 560 (D.C.S.D.N.Y.1963); Commonwealth v. Evans, 434 Pa. 52, 252 A.2d 689 (1969). See generally Recent Developments, Judicial Plea Bargaining, 19 Stan.L.Rev. 1082 (1967).\n\n\n8\n The only alternative to a jury trial available to Parker under the North Carolina statutes was a plea of guilty. Under the Federal Kidnaping Act, however, the possibility existed that a defendant could contest his guilt in a bench trial and simultaneously avoid a potential death penalty. Nothing more appearing, it is arguable that an individual who pleaded guilty without seeking a bench trial did so for reasons other than the fear of the death penalty.\nWe have previously held, however, that there is no constitutional right to a bench trial, Singer v. United States, 380 U.S. 24, 85 S.Ct. 783, 13 L.Ed.2d 630 (1965), and under Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 23 the consent of both the trial judge and the prosecution is a prerequisite to the waiver of a jury trial. In Brady the trial judge indicated that he would not permit the case to be tried without a jury. Thus, in substance, the choice that confronted Brady\u2014jury trial or guilty plea\u2014was the same that faced Parker.\nThere is room for argument that a direct confrontation between a trial judge and the defendant would have more impact upon the accused than a statute. However, when the accused appears before the trial judge, he at least has an opportunity to present his views to the judge, and, if all else fails, to preserve a record for direct or collateral review of any overreaching by the trial court.\n\n\n9\n North Carolina argues that Jackson ought not to be applied retroactively so as to affect guilty pleas entered prior to that decision. In one sense, of course, the Jackson retroactivity problem is chimerical, for the long-standing constitutional requirement that valid guilty pleas be voluntary and intelligent was not altered by that decision.\nHowever, Jackson did apply the standard of voluntariness in a new context by considering the inducement to plead guilty punishment scheme. In a sense, therefore, Jackson did in fact mandate a new application of the voluntariness test. To the extent that the retroactivity issue need be resolved, I have no difficulty in concluding that Jackson should be so applied as to provide relief for those who suffered the very constitutional vices that we condemned in that case. The entry of a guilty plea concerns the very essence of the guilt-determining process, and, if that plea is involuntarily induced, the result is 'to infect a criminal proceeding the innocent.' Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott, 382 U.S. 406, 416, 86 S.Ct. 459, 465, 15 L.Ed.2d 453 (1966). See Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 727\u2014729, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 1777\u20141779, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966); Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965).\n\n\n10\n If this statement means that no plea can be rendered involuntary by the statutory scheme, it was at least an obscure, not to say highly misleading, way of saying so. Laboy v. New Jersey, 266 F.Supp. 581 (D.C.N.J.1967), cited in Jackson, upon which the Court now seizes, is merely an example of a case that rejected an attack upon the voluntariness of a plea allegedly induced by fear of a death penalty. Surely it cannot be relied upon to establish guidelines with respect to the quantum of proof necessary to demonstrate the involuntariness of a plea under a Jackson-defective statute, particularly since the District Court in Laboy erroneously concluded, in dicta, that the Federal Kidnaping Act contained no constitutional infirmity.\n\n\n11\n See generally Scott v.

MacDougall, 392 F.2d 155, 158 n. 7 (C.A.4th Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 847, 89 S.Ct. 133, 21 L.Ed.2d 118 (1968): 'Plea bargaining that induces an innocent person to plead guilty cannot be sanctioned. Negotiation must be limited to the quantum of punishment for an admittedly guilty defendant.' (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n14\n A perceptive commentator, prior to our decision in Jackson, noted the interrelation of guilty pleas and an unconstitutional legislatively mandated capital punishment penalty scheme:\n'It is incontrovertible that the (Federal Kidnaping) act promises a person pleading guilty at least substantial security from the imposition of capital punishment, while it threatens him with the ultimate sanction of the law\u2014death. Can not the statute be accurately characterized as containing a legislative promise of substantial security from infliction of the death penalty in the event of a plea of guilty by the defendant? Is there any legitimate reason why a defendant's guilty plea under the act should be considered any less the product of coercion because it was induced by a legislative promise of substantial immunity than is a guilty plea induced by the previously mentioned judicial offers of sentencing concessions (in United States ex rel. Elksnis v. Gilligan, 256 F.Supp. 244 (D.C.S.D.N.Y.1966), and United States v. Tateo, 214 F.Supp. 560 (D.C.S.D.N.Y.1963))? Can it be seriously contended that statements given by police officers in order to avoid being discharged from their employment are any more the product of coercion than is a guilty plea made by a defendant in mortal fear of the executioner's chair (citing Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493, 87 S.Ct. 616, 17 L.Ed.2d 562 (1967))? In a capital case where a defendant is put to plea under the Lindbergh Law, he is faced with a choice 'between the rock and the whirlpool' (385 U.S., at 498, 87 S.Ct., at 619), and coercion quite probably is inherent in his choice to waive his right to a jury trial.' Note, United States v. Jackson: The Possible Consequences of Impairing the Right to Trial by Jury, 22 Rutgers L.Rev. 167, 189\u2014190 (1967). (Emphasis in original.)\n\n\n15\n Of course, no malevolent intent may be ascribed to the prosecution in seeking the death penalty prior to its invalidation in Jackson. That the death penalty could not have been exacted in the instant cases is, however, merely a consequence of the retroactive effect of Jackson. While the Court denies that Jackson affects the validity of guilty pleas, surely the Court would not insist that a sentence of death pronounced prior to our decision in Jackson could now be carried out. The Court's position, if I have accurately described it, does contain a certain paradoxical element. That is, any defendant who resisted the inducements of the Jackson-defective penalty scheme, received a jury trial and was sentenced to death, is presumably entitled to relief. However, the defendant who succumbed to the unconstitutional influence of that same scheme and pleaded guilty is left to suffer the consequences of his illicitly induced plea. While the relaxation of strict logic may be viewed sympathetically if necessary to prevent executions under an unconstitutional penalty scheme, I am at a loss to understand what values are preserved by the curious inversion the Court has brought about.\n\n\n16\n The Court apparently takes comfort from the authorities that it cites for the proposition that a guilty plea entered to avoid a possible death penalty is not involuntary. (397 U.S., at 792\u2014793, 90 S.Ct., at 1472 n. 14.) This reliance is misplaced. In the first instance, most of these authorities antedate Jackson and therefore were uninstructed by that decision. For example, it does not appear in those cases whether the capital punishment scheme was defective under Jackson or otherwise unconstitutional. In this discussion, I do not consider the case of a death penalty scheme that is not unconstitutional under Jackson.\nSecondly, several cases decided subsequent to Jackson take the position that a constitutionally defective capital penalty scheme may impermissibly induce guilty pleas. See, e.g., Alford v. North Carolina, 405 F.2d 340 (C.A.4th Cir. 1968), prob. juris. noted, 394 U.S. 956, 89 S.Ct. 1306, 22 L.Ed.2d 558 (1969), set for reargument, 397 U.S. 1060, 90 S.Ct. 1494, 25 L.Ed.2d 682; Quillien v. Leeke, 303 F.Supp. 698 (D.C.S.C.1969); Wilson v. United States, 303 F.Supp. 1139 (D.C.W.D.Va.1969); Shaw v. United States, 299 F.Supp. 824 (D.C.S.D.Ga.1969); Breland v. State of South Carolina, 253 S.C. 187, 169 S.E.2d 604 (1969). See also United States ex rel. Brown v. LaVallee, 424 F.2d 457 (C.A.2d Cir. 1970); Commonwealth v. Hargrove, 434 Pa. 393, 254 A.2d 22 (1969).\n\n\n17\n Sophistic arguments cannot alter the fact that this in substance was the effect of the North Carolina penalty scheme. It is contended by North Carolina, for example, that under the state statutes the actual penalty imposed upon conviction was death but that the jury had the power to mitigate punishment to life imprisonment. Under the Federal Kidnaping Act, so the argument goes, the penalty upon conviction was life imprisonment, or a term of years, but the jury had the power to increase the sentence beyond that which the trial judge could impose, thereby 'usurping the province of the judge in sentencing the defendant.' This is a distinction without a difference. The simple fact is that under both the Kidnaping Act and the North Carolina scheme the jury alone, in its unfettered discretion, could impose the death sentence. In both instances the defendant was promised by the legislature complete insulation from this awesome possibility if he would plead guilty.\n\n\n18\n See, e.g., State v. Spence, 274 N.C. 536, 164 S.E.2d 593 (1968); State v. Peele, 274 N.C. 106, 161 S.E.2d 568 (1968).\n\n\n19\n In view of my position on the Jackson issue, I need not, in this case, reach Parker's other contentions, in particular that his guilty plea was the product of his allegedly coerced confession. I would direct that Parker's allegations concerning the coerced confession be considered on remand in proceedings not inconsistent with my views as expressed in McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 775, 90 S.Ct. 1451, 25 L.Ed.2d 776, decided this day.\n\n\n20\n As previously noted, the trial judge indicated that he would not permit Brady to be tried without a jury. See n. 8, supra.\n\n\n","label":0}

Dewey SOWDERS, Warden.\nNos. 79-5949, 79-5951.\nArgued Nov. 10, 1980.\nDecided Jan. 13, 1981.\n\n\nSyllabus\n\nHeld:  A state criminal court is not required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to conduct a hearing out of the jury's presence whenever a defendant contends that a witness' identification of him was arrived at improperly.  Pp. 345-349.\n(a) Where identification evidence is at issue, no such special considerations as exist where the issue of the voluntariness of a confession is presented-an involuntary confession being inadmissible both because it is likely to be unreliable and because of society's aversion to forced confessions, even if true, Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908-justify a departure from the presumption that juries will follow the trial court's instructions.  It is the reliability of identification evidence that primarily determines its admissibility, and the proper evaluation of evidence under the trial judge's instructions is the very task our system must assume juries can perform.  Pp. 346-348.\n(b) There is no merit to the contention that vigorous and full cross-examination in the presence of the jury of witnesses as to the possible improprieties of pretrial identifications is inconsistent with due process of law.  While a \"predicament\" is always presented when a lawyer decides on cross-examination to ask a question that may produce an answer unfavorable to his client, the Due Process Clause does not inevitably require the abandonment of the time-honored process of cross-examination as the device best suited to determine the trustworthiness of testimonial evidence.  Pp. 348-349.\n(c) While a judicial determination outside the jury's presence as to the admissibility of identification evidence may often be advisable and, in some circumstances, not presented in these cases, may be constitutionally necessary, it does not follow that the Constitution requires a per se rule compelling such a procedure in every case.  P. 349.\n608 F.2d 247, affirmed.\nFrank W. Heft, Jr., Louisville, Ky., for petitioners.\nVictor Fox, Lexington, Ky., for respondents.\nJustice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThese cases, consolidated for argument and decision in the Court of Appeals and in this Court, present the question whether a state criminal trial court is constitutionally compelled to conduct a hearing outside the presence of the jury whenever a defendant contends that a witness' identification of him was arrived at improperly.\n\n\n2\n* A.\n\n\n3\nJohn Watkins, the petitioner in No. 79-5949, was convicted in a Kentucky court of attempting to rob a Louisville liquor store. On the night of January 11, 1975, four men entered the store, one of whom asked for a pack of cigarettes.  Walter Smith, an employee of the store, turned around to get the cigarettes, and one of the men said \"[t]his is a hold-up.\"  Donald Goeing, a part owner of the store, had been stocking a soft-drink cooler, and when he heard those words, he turned towards the robbers.  The man who had spoken thereupon fired two shots at him, one striking him in his arm, the other in the region of his heart.  The four men then fled.\n\n\n4\nThat night Smith and Goeing described the gunman to the police.  Two days later, the police in the presence of Smith conducted a lineup consisting of three men, one of whom was Watkins.  Smith identified Watkins as the gunman.  That same day, the police took Watkins to Goeing's hospital bed, and Goeing identified Watkins as the man who had shot him.  Watkins was then charged with first-degree robbery and first-degree assault.\n\n\n5\nAt the subsequent trial of Watkins, the prosecution called Smith and Goeing as witnesses.  They both identified Watkins as Goeing's assailant but were not asked by the prosecution about the lineup or the showup.  Watkins' counsel, however, cross-examined both men at some length about both the lineup and showup.  The prosecution then called a police officer.  He testified that he had taken Watkins to be identified at the hospital because \"at that time there was some question as to whether or not Mr. Goeing was going to survive the incident.\"  Watkins' counsel cross-examined the officer about both the showup and the lineup and through him introduced pictures of the lineup.  For the defense, Watkins' counsel called two witnesses who said that they had been in a pool hall with Watkins at the time of the robbery and another witness who said he had been in the liquor store at the time of the robbery and had not seen Watkins.  Finally, Watkins himself testified to his innocence.\n\n\n6\nOn appeal, as he had at trial, counsel for Watkins argued that the trial court had a constitutional obligation to conduct a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine whether the identification evidence was admissible.  The Supreme Court of Kentucky rejected that argument.  Relying on its decision in Ray v. Commonwealth, 550 S.W.2d 482, 483 (1977), the court said \" '[a]lthough we are of the opinion that the holding of such a hearing prior to the introduction of this testimony would have been the preferred course to follow, we are not persuaded the failure to have done so requires reversal of appellant's conviction.' \"  Watkins v. Commonwealth, 565 S.W.2d 630, 631 (1978).  The court found that the identification procedures \"fail[ed] to raise any impermissible suggestiveness\" and that Watkins \"was in no way prejudiced.\"  Ibid.\n\n\n7\nWatkins then unsuccessfully sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.  That court held that, \"although pretrial suppression hearings are preferable, the failure to hold them does not require the reversal of a conviction.\"1  The court also found that admission of neither the lineup nor the showup evidence at the state trial had violated constitutional standards.\n\n\n8\nThe Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment and, like the District Court, ruled that a hearing on the admissibility of identification evidence need not be held outside the presence of the jury.  Turning to the evidence itself, the court cited Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199, as authority for holding that \"[g]iven the seriousness of the wounds to Donald Goeing, a showup was necessary in this case.\"  Summitt v. Bordenkircher, 608 F.2d 247, 252.  The federal appellate court also held that the lineup evidence had been constitutionally admissible at the state trial.\n\nB\n\n9\nJames Summitt, the petitioner in No. 79-5951, was convicted in a Kentucky court of rape.  Late on the night of July 20, 1974, the prosecutrix was forced into a car occupied by two men, driven to an isolated location, raped by one of the men, and then returned to her own car.  The next day she reported the crime to the police, described the rapist, and looked through 12 volumes of photographs from police files, without identifying the man who had raped her.  Two days later she was taken to another police station, where she examined more pictures.  A police officer testified at the subsequent trial of Summitt that \"after a short time she pointed to the defendant's picture and said:  'This is the man that raped me. There's no doubt about it, this is Jimbo, the man that raped me.' \"  In addition to the officer, the prosecutrix and her stepfather as witnesses for the prosecution described the prosecutrix's examination of the police photographs, and the prosecutrix testified that Summitt was the man who had raped her.  There was extensive cross-examination.\n\n\n10\nThe Supreme Court of Kentucky found \"no error in the trial court's refusal to conduct a suppression hearing and no semblance of impermissible suggestiveness in the identification procedure.\" Summitt v. Commonwealth, 550 S.W.2d 548, 550 (1977).  Summitt then sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, but that court found no constitutional error.  The Court of Appeals, as in the consolidated Watkins case, affirmed the judgment of the District Court, 608 F.2d 247.\n\n\n11\nWe granted certiorari to consider the constitutional claim asserted by both petitioners throughout their state and federal court proceedings.  Sub nom. Watkins v. Bordenkircher and Summitt v. Bordenkircher, 445 U.S. 926, 100 S.Ct. 1312, 63 L.Ed.2d 759.\n\nII\n\n12\nThe issue before us is not, of course, whether a trial court acts prudently in holding a hearing out of the presence of the jury to determine the admissibility of identification evidence. The prudence of such a hearing has been emphasized by many decisions in the Courts of Appeals, most of which have in various ways admonished trial courts to use that procedure.2  The issue here, rather, is whether such a hearing is required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n13\nIn urging an affirmative answer, the petitioners first cite cases holding that a defendant has a right to the presence of his counsel at a postindictment lineup, e. g., United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149, and that an identification procedure, in the absence of a lineup, may be so defective as to deprive a defendant of due process of law, e. g., Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199. The petitioners then analogize their cases to Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908, in which this Court enunciated a defendant's right \"to have a fair hearing and a reliable determination on the issue of voluntariness,\" id., at 377, 84 S.Ct., at 1781, and in which the Court declared unconstitutional a New York procedure which gave the jury what was in practice unreviewable discretion to decide whether a confession was or was not voluntary.\n\n\n14\nThe petitioners contend that Jackson v. Denno established a per se due process right to a hearing outside the presence of the jury whenever a question of the voluntariness of a confession is raised.  If such a hearing is required where the voluntariness of a confession is at issue, it follows, the petitioners argue, that a similar hearing must also be required where the propriety of identification procedures has been questioned.\n\n\n15\nEven if it be assumed that Jackson v. Denno did establish the per se rule asserted,3 the petitioners' argument must fail, because Jackson v. Denno is not analogous to the cases now before us.  The Court in Jackson did reject the usual presumption that a jury can be relied upon to determine issues according to the trial judge's instructions, but the Court did so because of the peculiar problems the issue of the voluntariness of a confession presents. The Court pointed out that, while an involuntary confession is inadmissible in part because such a confession is likely to be unreliable, it is also inadmissible even if it is true, because of the \" 'strongly felt attitude of our society that important human values are sacrificed where an agency of the government, in the course of securing a conviction, wrings a confession out of an accused against his will.' \"  Id., at 385, 84 S.Ct., at 1785, quoting Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U.S. 199, 206-207, 80 S.Ct. 274, 279, 4 L.Ed.2d 242.  The Court concluded in Jackson that a jury \"may find it difficult to understand the policy forbidding reliance upon a coerced, but true confession. . . .  Objective consideration of the conflicting evidence concerning the circumstances of the confession becomes difficult and the [jury's] implicit findings become suspect.\"  Id., 378 U.S., at 382, 84 S.Ct., at 1783.\n\n\n16\nWhere identification evidence is at issue, however, no such special considerations justify a departure from the presumption that juries will follow instructions.  It is the reliability of identification evidence that primarily determines its admissibility, Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 113-114, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 2252, 53 L.Ed.2d 140;  United States ex rel. Kirby v. Sturges, 510 F.2d 397, 402-404 (CA7 1975)  (Stevens, J.).  And the proper evaluation of evidence under the instructions of the trial judge is the very task our system must assume juries can perform. Indeed, as the cases before us demonstrate, the only duty of a jury in cases in which identification evidence has been admitted will often be to assess the reliability of that evidence.  Thus the Court's opinion in Manson v. Brathwaite approvingly quoted Judge Leventhal's statement that,\n\n\n17\n\" '[w]hile identification testimony is significant      evidence, such testimony is still only evidence, and, unlike      the presence of counsel, is not a factor that goes to the      very heart-the 'integrity'-of the adversary process.\n\n\n18\n\" 'Counsel can both cross-examine the identification      witnesses and argue in summation as to factors causing doubts      as to the accuracy of the identification-including reference      to both any suggestibility in the identification procedure      and any countervailing testimony such as alibi.' \"  432 U.S.,      at 114, n. 14, 97 S.Ct., at 2253, n. 14, quoting Clemons v.      United States, 133 U.S.App.D.C. 27, 48, 408 F.2d 1230, 1251      (1968)  (concurring opinion)  (footnote omitted).\n\n\n19\nThe petitioners argue, however, that cross-examination is inadequate in cases such as these.  They assert that the presence of the jury deterred their lawyers from cross-examining the witnesses vigorously and fully as to the possible improprieties of the pretrial identifications in these cases.  The petitioners point to no specific instances in the trial when their counsel were thus deterred, and the record reveals that the cross-examination on the identity issues was, if not always effective, both active and extended.  Nonetheless, the petitioners rely on a passage from United States v. Wade, supra, which referred to\n\n\n20\n\"the predicament in which Wade's counsel found      himself-realizing that possible unfairness at the lineup may      be the sole means of attack upon the unequivocal courtroom      identification, and having to probe in the dark in an attempt      to discover and reveal unfairness, while bolstering the      government witness' courtroom identification by bringing out      and dwelling upon his prior identification.\"  388 U.S., at      240-241, 87 S.Ct., at 1939.\n\n\n21\nThe petitioners, however, attribute undue significance to this passage.  The \"predicament\" described in Wade was no more than part of the Court's demonstration that, if identification stemming from an improperly conducted lineup was to be excluded, a courtroom identification based on such a lineup logically had to be excluded as well.\n\n\n22\nA \"predicament,\" if one chooses to call it that, is always presented when a lawyer decides on cross-examination to ask a question that may produce an answer unfavorable to his client. Yet, under our adversary system of justice, cross-examination has always been considered a most effective way to ascertain truth.4 We decline in these cases to hold that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment inevitably requires the abandonment of the time-honored process of cross-examination as the device best suited to determine the trustworthiness of testimonial evidence.\n\n\n23\nA judicial determination outside the presence of the jury of the admissibility of identification evidence may often be advisable.  In some circumstances, not presented here, such a determination may be constitutionally necessary.  But it does not follow that the Constitution requires a per se rule compelling such a procedure in every case.\n\nAccordingly, the judgments are\n\n24\nAffirmed.\n\n\n25\nJustice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting.\n\n\n26\nThe Court holds that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not require that the trial judge in each of the instant cases hold a \"fair hearing,\" Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 377, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 1780, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964), to decide the admissibility of eyewitness identification evidence, and that a remand is not now required to accord such a hearing.  While freely conceding that a \"judicial determination outside the presence of the jury of the admissibility of identification evidence may often be advisable [and i]n some circumstances . . . constitutionally necessary,\" ante, at 349. the Court holds that the Constitution does not require \"a per se rule compelling such a procedure in every case,\" ibid.  I dissent.  In my view, the Due Process Clause mandates such a hearing whenever a defendant, as both petitioners did at their respective trials below, has proffered some evidence that pretrial police procedures directed at identification were impermissibly suggestive.  The flaw in the Court's reasoning lies in its statement that identification evidence does not implicate the \"special considerations\" on which Jackson v. Denno relied to \"justify a departure from the presumption that juries will follow instructions.\"  Ante, at 347. Surely jury instructions can ordinarily no more cure the erroneous admission of powerful identification evidence than they can cure the erroneous admission of a confession.  Accordingly, the separate judicial determination of admissibility required byJackson for confessions is equally applicable for eyewitness identification evidence.  Because the record before us is inadequate to conclude that in each case the identification evidence was properly admitted, see Jackson v. Denno, supra, at 376-377, 84 S.Ct., at 1780, I would remand these cases for further proceedings.\n\n\n27\nAt least since United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), the Court has recognized the inherently suspect qualities of eyewitness identification evidence.1  Two particular attributes of such evidence have significance for the instant cases.  First, eyewitness identification evidence is notoriously unreliable:\n\n\n28\n\"The vagaries of eyewitness identification are well-known;      the annals of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken identification.  Mr. Justice Frankfurter once      said:  'What is the worth of identification testimony even      when uncontradicted?  The identification of strangers is      proverbially untrustworthy.  The hazards of such testimony      are established by a formidable number of instances in the      records of English and American trials.  These instances are      recent-not due to the brutalities of ancient criminal      procedure.'  The Case of Sacco and Vanzetti 30 (1927).\"  Id.,      at 228, 87 S.Ct., at 1933 (footnote omitted).\n\n\n29\nManson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 111-112, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 2251, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977), emphasized this troublesome characteristic of such evidence:\n\n\n30\n\"The driving force behind United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218      [87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149] (1967), Gilbert v.      California, 388 U.S. 263 [87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178]      (1967) (right to counsel at a post-indictment lineup), and      Stovall, all decided on the same day, was the Court's      concern with the problems of eyewitness identification.      Usually the witness must testify about an encounter with a      total stranger under circumstances of emergency or emotional      stress.  The witness' recollection of the stranger can be      distorted easily by the circumstances or by later actions of      the police.\"\n\n\n31\nAccordingly, to guard against the \"dangers inherent in eyewitness identification,\" United States v. Wade, supra, at 235, 87 S.Ct., at 1936, the Court has required the presence of counsel at postindictment lineups, 388 U.S., at 236-237, 87 S.Ct., at 1936,2 and has held inadmissible identification evidence tainted by suggestive confrontation procedures and lacking adequate indicia of reliability, Manson v. Brathwaite, supra, 432 U.S., at 114, 97 S.Ct., at 2253. \"Thus, Wade and its companion cases reflect the concern that the jury not hear eyewitness testimony unless that evidence has aspects of reliability.\"  432 U.S., at 112, 97 S.Ct., at 2252.  An important thrust of our eyewitness identification evidence cases from Wade to Manson, therefore, has been to prevent impairment of the jury's decisionmaking process by the introduction of unreliable identification evidence.\n\n\n32\nSecond, despite its inherent unreliability, much eyewitness identification evidence has a powerful impact on juries.  Juries seem most receptive to, and not inclined to discredit, testimony of a witness who states that he saw the defendant commit the crime.3\n\n\n33\n\"[E]yewitness testimony is likely to be believed by jurors,      especially when it is offered with a high level of      confidence, even though the accuracy of an eyewitness and the      confidence of that witness may not be related to one another      at all.  All the evidence points rather strikingly to the      conclusion that there is almost nothing more convincing than      a live human being who takes the stand, points a finger at      the defendant, and says 'That's the one!' \"4\n\n\n34\nThe powerful impact that much eyewitness identification evidence has on juries, regardless of its reliability,5 virtually mandates that, when such evidence is inadmissible, the jury should know nothing about the evidence.  See Manson v. Brathwaite, supra, at 112, 97 S.Ct., at 2251.  For certainly the resulting prejudice to the defendant cannot be erased by jury instructions.  See generally E. Loftus, Eyewitness Testimony 189-190 (1979);  P. Devlin, Report to the Secretary of State for the Home Department of the Departmental Committee on Evidence of Identification in Criminal Cases 149-150 (1976).  The Court's contrary conclusion cavalierly dismisses the inherent unreliability of identification evidence and its effect on juries-two attributes of confession evidence that led the Court to mandate a \"fair hearing\" safeguard in Jackson v. Denno.\n\n\n35\nAny purported distinction between the instant cases and Jackson is plainly specious.  In Jackson, this Court invalidated a New York State procedure whereby the jury was instructed first to determine the voluntariness of a defendant's confession6 and then to disregard the confession if it concluded that the confession was involuntary.  Jackson struck down this practice and required first that the voluntariness of a confession be determined by the judge before its admission in evidence, and second that the jury not be allowed to consider an inadmissible confession.  Jackson refused to rely on the curative effect of jury instructions where the trial judge had not applied \" 'the exclusionary rules before permitting evidence to be submitted to the jury.' \"  378 U.S., at 382, n. 10, 84 S.Ct., at 1783, n. 10, quoting Meltzer, Involuntary Confessions:  The Allocation of Responsibility Between Judge and Jury, 21 U.Chi.L.Rev. 317, 327 (1954).7\n\n\n36\nFor purposes of the instant cases, three factors central to our decision in Jackson are apposite.  First, Jackson stated, as the Court today notes, ante, at 347, \"that the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the use of involuntary confessions . . . because of the probable unreliability of confessions that are obtained in a manner deemed coercive.\"  378 U.S., at 385-386, 84 S.Ct., at 1785.  Second, Jackson stated, as the Court today further notes, ante, at 347, that involuntary confessions are inadmissible \"because of the 'strongly felt attitude of our society that important human values are sacrificed where an agency of the government, in the course of securing a conviction, wrings a confession out of an accused against his will.' \"  378 U.S., at 386, 84 S.Ct., at 1785.8  Third, because of the sensitive nature of confession evidence, Jackson found that instructions were not adequate to assure that the jury would ignore involuntary confession evidence:\n\n\n37\n\"Under the New York procedure, the fact of a defendant's      confession is solidly implanted in the jury's mind, for it      has not only heard the confession, but it has also been      instructed to consider and judge its voluntariness and is in      position to assess whether it is true or false.[9]  If it      finds the confession involuntary, does the jury-indeed, can      it-then disregard the confession in accordance with its      instructions?  If there are lingering doubts about the      sufficiency of the other evidence, does the jury      unconsciously lay them to rest by resort to the confession?      Will uncertainty about the sufficiency of the other evidence      to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt actually result in      acquittal when the jury knows the defendant has given a      truthful confession.\"  Id., at 388, 84 S.Ct., at 1786      (footnote omitted).\n\n\n38\nSimilar considerations plainly require a hearing in the case of identification evidence.  First, there can be little doubt that identification evidence is as potentially unreliable as confession evidence.  See supra, at 350-352. Second, suggestive confrontation procedures which, in the totality of the circumstances, create \" 'a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification,' \" Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S., at 116, 97 S.Ct., at 2254, quoting Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, 971, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968), are as impermissible a police practice as the securing of a custodial confession determined, in the totality of the circumstances, to be involuntary, see United States v. Washington, 431 U.S. 181, 188, 97 S.Ct. 1814, 1819, 52 L.Ed.2d 238 (1977);  cf. North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U.S. 369, 374-375, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 1758, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979) (waiver).  See also Manson v. Brathwaite, supra, at 112, 97 S.Ct., at 2251;  Foster v. California, 394 U.S. 440, 442-443, 89 S.Ct. 1127, 1128, 22 L.Ed.2d 402 (1969);  United States v. Wade, 388 U.S., at 228-229, 232-235, 87 S.Ct., at 1932, 1934;  Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 302, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 1972, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967).  And third, because of the extraordinary impact of much eyewitness identification evidence, juries hearing such evidence will be no more able fully to ignore it upon instruction of the trial judge than will juries hearing confession evidence.10  To expect a jury to engage in the collective mental gymnastic of segregating and ignoring such testimony upon instruction is utterly unrealistic.  The Court's bald assertion, therefore, that jury instructions are adequate to protect the accused, is as untrue for identification evidence as it is for involuntary confessions.\n\n\n39\nNor can it be assumed, as the Court has, that cross-examination will protect the accused in this circumstance. That is no more true here than it was in Jackson, where the defendant was also allowed to cross-examine on the question of voluntariness.  Cross-examination, of course, affects the weight and credibility given by the jury to evidence,11 but cross-examination is both an ineffective and a wrong tool for purging inadmissible identification evidence from the jurors' minds.  It is an ineffective tool because all of the scientific evidence suggests that much eyewitness identification testimony has an unduly powerful effect on jurors.  Thus, the jury is likely to give the erroneously admitted evidence substantial weight, however skillful the cross-examination.  See generally E. Loftus, Eyewitness Testimony 9 (1979).  Cross-examination is also a wrong tool in the sense that jury instructions are the means normally employed to cure the erroneous introduction of evidence.  At best, cross-examination might diminish the weight the jury accords to the inadmissible evidence.  The likelihood is, however, that the jury would continue to give the improperly admitted evidence substantial weight, even if properly instructed to disregard it.\n\n\n40\nIt is clear beyond peradventure, I submit, that because of the dangers to a just result inherent in identification evidence-its unreliability and its unusual impact on the jury-a \"fair hearing and a reliable determination\" of admissibility, Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S., at 377, 84 S.Ct., at 1781, are constitutionally mandated.  The Due Process Clause obviously precludes the jury from convicting on unreliable identification evidence.  Manson v. Brathwaite, supra.12  But the only way to be sure that the jury will not rest its verdict on improper identification evidence, as a practical matter, is by not permitting the jury to hear it in the first place.  A Jackson v. Denno hearing would expediently accomplish that purpose.13  I believe that the Due Process Clause requires no less.\n\n\n41\nA large and distinguished group shares my view.  The lower federal courts with virtual unanimity have encouraged the type of hearing sought by petitioners.14  As already noted, the Court too states that \"[a] judicial determination outside the presence of the jury of the admissibility of identification evidence may often be advisable [and i]n some circumstances . . . constitutionally necessary.\"  Ante, at 349. I should think it follows from this congruence of opinion on the desirability of such a judicial hearing that evolving standards of justice15 mandate such a hearing whenever a defendant proffers sufficient evidence to raise a colorable claim that police confrontation procedures were impermissibly suggestive.  See, e. g., United States ex rel. Fisher v. Driber, 546 F.2d 18, 22 (CA3 1976).\n\n\n42\nIn the instant cases, the suggestiveness of the confrontation procedures was clearly shown, and equally clearly cross-examination in front of the jury was inadequate to test the reliability of the evidence because of the undoubted inhibiting effect on cross-examination from fear that rigorous questioning of hostile witnesses would strengthen the eyewitnesses' testimony and impress it upon the jury.  See United States v. Wade, 388 U.S., at 240-241, 87 S.Ct., at 1939.16  In any event, the record is inadequate to decide that petitioners could not have succeeded in foreclosing admission of the evidence if they had been afforded a hearing out of the jury's presence in the first place. Accordingly, I would remand for such further proceedings as are necessary to give these petitioners \"a fair hearing and a reliable determination,\" Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S., at 377, 84 S.Ct., at 1781, that the identification evidence in each trial was not erroneously admitted.\n\n\n\n1\n The opinion of the District Court is unreported.\n\n\n2\n E. g., United States v. Mitchell, 540 F.2d 1163 (CA3 1976);  United States v. Cranson, 453 F.2d 123 (CA4 1971); Haskins v. United States, 433 F.2d 836 (CA10 1970);  United States v. Ranciglio, 429 F.2d 228 (CA8 1970);  United States v. Allison, 414 F.2d 407 (CA9 1969);  United States v. Broadhead, 413 F.2d 1351 (CA7 1969);  Clemons v. United States, 133 U.S.App.D.C. 27, 408 F.2d 1230 (1968)  (en banc).  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has left the matter to the discretion of the district courts.  United States v. Smith, 546 F.2d 1275 (1977). At least two Federal Courts of Appeals have commended hearings outside the presence of the jury to state courts, Nassar v. Vinzant, 519 F.2d 798 (CA1 1975);  United States ex rel. Phipps v. Follette, 428 F.2d 912 (CA2 1970), and at least one has held that due process may in some circumstances require a hearing outside the presence of a jury to decide the admissibility of identification evidence.  United States ex rel. Fisher v. Driber, 546 F.2d 18 (CA3 1976).\n\n\n3\n See Pinto v. Pierce, 389 U.S. 31, 32, 88 S.Ct. 192, 193, 19 L.Ed.2d 31:\n\"This Court has never ruled that all voluntariness hearings must be held outside the presence of the jury, regardless of the circumstances. . . .  [B]ecause a disputed confession may be found involuntary and inadmissible by the judge, it would seem prudent to hold voluntariness hearings outside the presence of the jury. . . .  In this case, however, the confession was held voluntary and admitted as evidence suitable for consideration by the jury.\"\n\n\n4\n As Professor Wigmore put it, \"[cross-examination] is beyond any doubt the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\"  5 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1367 (Chadbourn rev. 1974).\n\n\n1\n The special nature of eyewitness identification evidence has produced an enormous reservoir of scholarly writings, many based on solid empirical research.  For a bibliography of that literature, see E. Loftus, Eyewitness Testimony 237-247 (1979).\n\n\n2\n \"[S]uggestibility inherent in the context of the pretrial identification\" is a factor that has led the Court to require the presence of counsel at postindictment lineups.  United States v. Wade, 388 U.S, at 235, 87 S.Ct., at 1936.  If counsel is not present at such a lineup, the identification may not be introduced into evidence at trial and an in-court identification may be made only if the prosecutor establishes \"by clear and convincing evidence that the in-court identification [was] based upon observation . . . of the suspect other than the lineup identificatio[n].\"  Id., at 240, 87 S.Ct., at 1939.\n\n\n3\n \"[J]uries unfortunately are often unduly receptive to [identification] evidence. . . .\"  Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 120, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 2255 (1977) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted).  See Loftus, supra, at 8-19;  P. Wall, Eye-witness Identification in Criminal Cases 19-23 (1965); Hammelmann & Williams, Identification Parades-II, 1963 Crim.L.Rev. 545, 550.  See generally A. Yarmey, The Psychology of Eyewitness Testimony (1979).\n\n\n4\n Loftus, supra, at 19 (emphasis supplied).  Professor Loftus exhaustively canvasses statistical and psychological evidence which persuasively supports her conclusion that eyewitness identification evidence is \"overwhelmingly influential.\"  Id., at 9.\n\n\n5\n Professor Loftus, ibid. (emphasis in original), observes that \"[j]urors have been known to accept eyewitness testimony pointing to guilt even when it is far outweighed by evidence of innocence.\"\nWall, supra, at 19 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis supplied), concludes:  \"Juries are unduly receptive to identification evidence and are not sufficiently aware of its dangers.  It has been said that 'positive recognition by well intended uninterested persons is commonly accepted unless the alibi is convincing,' and that evidence of identification, however untrustworthy, is 'taken by the average juryman as absolute proof.' \"\n\n\n6\n Distinguishing Jackson from the instant cases on the basis that the jury there was first instructed to determine voluntariness is not persuasive.  That consideration goes to the weight given the evidence by the jury.  Jackson itself recognized that the lingering effect of the involuntary confession might be decisive in the jury's deliberations.  Such an effect is no less likely to be decisive in the case of powerful eyewitness identification evidence that a jury has been instructed to ignore. In both instances, peculiarly powerful evidence must leave an indelible impact on a juror's mind.  See n. 7, infra.\n\n\n7\n The Court in Jackson noted:\n\" 'Due Process of law requires that a coerced confession be excluded from consideration by the jury.  It also requires that the issue of coercion be tried by an unprejudiced trier, and, regardless of the pious fictions indulged by the courts, it is useless to contend that a juror who has heard the confession can be uninfluenced by his opinion as to the truth or falsity of it. . . .  And the rule of exclusion ought not to be emasculated by admitting the evidence and giving to the jury an instruction which, as every judge and lawyer knows, cannot be obeyed.' \"  378 U.S., at 382-383, n. 10, 84 S.Ct., at 1783, n. 10, quoting E. Morgan, Some Problems of Proof Under the Anglo-American System of Litigation 104-105 (1956).\n\n\n8\n Of course, police misbehavior is not always so lacking in subtlety that involuntary confessions are invariably wrenched from an accused by force.  Thus, indirect methods of interrogation which seek to elicit a statement from a custodial suspect may also warrant a conclusion of involuntariness.  See Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1690, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980) (interrogation includes actions which \"the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response\"); cf. Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387, 97 S.Ct. 1232, 51 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977) (Sixth Amendment violation).\n\n\n9\n See n. 6, supra.\n\n\n10\n In both of these cases, the eyewitnesses were also the victims of the crimes.  Not only does that dual status affect the reliability of the identification, but it also is likely to make the testimony more powerful and thus less curable by jury instructions.  Clearly, this is not a case where 14 reliable identifications were properly received in evidence, but a 15th by a nonvictim witness was subject to suggestive confrontation procedures and was unreliable, thereby raising the possibility that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n11\n In Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S., at 116, 97 S.Ct., at 2254, the Court stated:\n\"We are content to rely upon the good sense and judgment of American juries, for evidence with some element of untrustworthiness is customary grist for the jury mill.  Juries are not so susceptible that they cannot measure intelligently the weight of identification testimony that has some questionable feature.\"\n\n\n12\n In Jackson v. Denno, the Court was concerned that the jury not hear a defendant's confession until a trial judge had made a preliminary determination of voluntariness.  The Court assumed that were this not done, a deleterious impact on the jury's deliberations would operate:  \"[I]t is only a reliable determination on the voluntariness issue which satisfies the constitutional rights of the defendant and which would permit the jury to consider the confession in adjudicating guilt or innocence.\"  378 U.S., at 387, 84 S.Ct., at 1786.\n\n\n13\n The Court errs in any event in deciding these cases on the premise that petitioners request a per se rule requiring a hearing out of the jury's presence in every case.  In the first place, petitioners rely substantially on authority which does not go that far.  Brief for Petitioners 43-45.  Clearly, they have sought reversal of their convictions on the basis that they were entitled to such a hearing.  Moreover, there is no question here that they raised a colorable claim that the confrontation procedures were impermissibly suggestive.  See, e. g., United States ex rel. Fisher v. Driber, 546 F.2d 18, 22 (CA3 1976); United States v. Cranson, 453 F.2d 123, 127 (CA4 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 909, 92 S.Ct. 1607, 31 L.Ed.2d 821 (1972).\nIf the Court's result is out of concern for not adding another layer of complexity to criminal litigation, that is understandable, but not sufficient to supplant an accused's constitutional right.  Moreover, a rule requiring the defendant to proffer some minimum quantum of evidence showing the suggestiveness of the confrontation procedures would eliminate frivolous requests.  See, e. g., United States ex rel. Fisher v. Driber, supra, at 22.\n\n\n14\n United States ex rel.Fisher v. Driber, supra, at 22 (requiring hearing outside presence of jury where motion for such hearing is not frivolous);  United States v.

Even the Court of Appeals deciding these cases stated that it had \"no doubt that\" a hearing out of the jury's presence \"is the preferable procedure.\"  Summitt v. Bordenkircher, 608 F.2d 247, 250 (CA6 1979).\nIn addition, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, where petitioners were tried and convicted, appears to require a hearing out of the presence of the jury, upon defendant's motion, for confession and for search evidence.  See Ky.Rule Crim.Proc. 9.78.  In addition, Moore v. Commonwealth, 569 S.W.2d 150, 153 (Ky.1978), decided after petitioners were convicted, held that the trial court's refusal to hold a suppression hearing to determine the admissibility of identification evidence constituted error. Previous Kentucky appellate decisions had reached a similar conclusion.  E. g., Francis v. Commonwealth, 468 S.W.2d 287 (App.1971).\n\n\n15\n See, e. g., Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 669, 86 S.Ct. 1079, 1082, 16 L.Ed.2d 169 (1966) (equal protection);  Trop v.

(Eighth Amendment).\n\n\n16\n It is no answer to say, as the Court does, that the record does not reflect that petitioners' respective counsel were deterred by the presence of the jury, for the simple reason that a cold record cannot reflect questions not asked.\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"370 U.S. 49\n82 S.Ct. 1209\n8 L.Ed.2d 325\nRobert Elmer GALLEGOS, Petitioner,v.STATE OF COLORADO.\nNo. 475.\nArgued April 9, 1962.\nDecided June 4, 1962.\nRehearing Denied June 25, 1962.\n\nSee 370 U.S. 965, 82 S.Ct. 1579.\nCharles S. Vigil, Denver, Colo., for petitioner.\nJohn F. Brauer, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner, a child of 14, and another juvenile followed an elderly man to a hotel, got into his room on a ruse, assaulted him, overpowered him, stole $13 from his pockets, and fled. All this happened on December 20, 1958. Petitioner was picked up by the police on January 1, 1959, and immediately admitted the assault and robbery. At that time, however, the victim of the robbery was still alive, though hospitalized. He died on January 26, 1959, and forthwith an information charging first degree murder was returned against petitioner. A jury found him guilty, the crucial evidence introduced at the trial being a formal confession which he signed on January 7, 1959, after he had been held for five days during which time he saw no lawyer, parent or other friendly adult. The Supreme Court of Colorado affirmed the judgment of conviction. 145 Colo. 53, 358 P.2d 1028. We granted the petition for certiorari, 368 U.S. 815, 82 S.Ct. 70, 7 L.Ed.2d 23.\n\n\n2\nAfter petitioner's arrest on January 1, the following events took place. His mother tried to see him on Friday, January 2, but permission was denied, the reason given being that visiting hours were from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Monday and Thursday. From January 1 through January 7, petitioner was in Junvenile Hall, where he was kept in security, though he was allowed to eat with the other inmates. He was examined by the police in Juvenile Hall January 2, and made a confession which an officer recorded in longhand. On January 3, 1959, a complaint was filed against him in the Juvenile Court by the investigating detectives.\n\n\n3\nThe State in its brief calls this preliminary procedure in Juvenile Hall being 'booked in.' As noted, petitioner signed a full and formal confession on January 7. The trial in the Juvenile Court took place January 16 on a petition dated January 13 containing a charge of 'assault to injure.' He was committed to the State Industrial School for an indeterminate period. Thereafter, as noted above, the victim of the robbery died and the murder trial was held.\n\n\n4\nConfessions obtained by 'secret inquisitorial processes' (Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227, 237, 60 S.Ct. 472, 477, 84 L.Ed. 716) are suspect, since such procedures are conducive to the use of physical and psychological pressures. Chambers v. Florida, supra; Leyra v. Denno, 347 U.S. 556, 74 S.Ct. 716, 98 L.Ed. 948. The reason that due process, as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, condemns the obtaining of confessions in that manner is a compound of two influences. First is the procedural requirement stated in Chambers v. Florida, supra, 309 U.S. 236\u2014237, 60 S.Ct. 477:\n\n\n5\n'From the popular hatred and abhorrence of illegal      confinement, torture and extortion of confessions of      violations of the 'law of the land' evolved the fundamental      idea that no man's life, liberty or property be forfeited as      criminal punishment for violation of that law until there had      been a charge fairly made and fairly tried in a public      tribunal free of prejudice, passion, excitement and      tyrannical power. Thus, as assurance against ancient evils,      our country, in order to preserve 'the blessings of liberty',      wrote into its basic law the requirement, among others, that      the forfeiture of the lives, liberties or property of people      accused of crime can only follow if procedural safeguards of      due process have been obeyed.'\n\n\n6\nWe emphasized this point in Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U.S. 143, 152, 64 S.Ct. 921, 925, 88 L.Ed. 1192, where we said that 'always evidence concerning the inner details of secret inquisitions is weighted against an accused * * *.'\n\n\n7\nSecond is the element of compulsion which is condemned by the Fifth Amendment. Chief Justice Hughes in Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278, 285, 56 S.Ct. 461, 464, 80 L.Ed. 682, emphasized that ingredient of due process. After noting that the Court had held that the exemption from compulsory self-incrimination in the courts of the States is not guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, he went on to say:\n\n\n8\n'But the question of the right of the state to withdraw the      privilege against self-incrimination is not here involved. The compulsion to which the quoted statements      refer is that of the processes of justice by which the      accused may be called as a witness and required to testify.      Compulsion by torture to extort a confession is a different      matter.' And see Brennan, The Bill of Rights and the States,      36 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 761.\n\n\n9\nWe reiterated that view in Ashcraft v. Tennessee, supra, where we held that the principle in Bram v. United States, 168 U.S. 532, 562\u2014563, 18 S.Ct. 183, 194, 42 L.Ed. 568, was applicable to state proceedings. 322 U.S. at 154, note 9, 64 S.Ct. at 926. We said:\n\n\n10\n'We think a situation such as that here shown by      uncontradicted evidence is so inherently coercive that its      every existence is irreconcilable with the possession of      mental freedom by a lone suspect against whom its full      coercive force is brought to bear. It is inconceivable that      any court of justice in the land, conducted as our courts      are, open to the public, would permit prosecutors serving in      relays to keep a defendant witness under continuous cross      examination for thirty-six hours without rest or sleep in an      effort to extract a 'voluntary' confession. Nor can we,      consistently with Constitutional due process of law, hold      voluntary a confession where prosecutors do the same thing      away from the restraining influences of a public trial in an      open court room.' 322 U.S. at 154, 64 S.Ct. at 926. (Italics      added.)\n\n\n11\nThe application of these principles involves close scrutiny of the facts of individual cases. The length of the questioning (Spano v. New York, 360 U.S. 315, 79 S.Ct. 1202, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265), the use of fear to break a suspect (Malinski v. New York, 324 U.S. 401, 65 S.Ct. 781, 89 L.Ed. 1029), the youth of the accused (Haley v. Ohio, 332 U.S. 596, 68 S.Ct. 302, 92 L.Ed. 224) are illustrative of the circumstances on which cases of this kind turn. The youth of the suspect was the crucial factor in Haley v. Ohio, supra, at 599\u2014600, 68 S.Ct. at 303:\n\n\n12\n'What transpired would make us pause for careful inquiry if a      mature man were involved. And when, as here, a mere child\u2014an      easy victim of the law\u2014is before us, special care in      scrutinizing the record must be used. Age 15 is a tender and      difficult age for a boy of any race. He cannot be judged by      the more exacting standards of maturity. That which would      leave a man cold and unimpressed can overawe and overwhelm a      lad in his early teens. This is the period of great      instability which the crisis of adolescence produces. A      15-year-old lad, questioned through the dead of night by      relays of police, is a ready victim of the inquisition.      Mature men possibly might stand the ordeal from midnight to 5      a.m. But we cannot believe that a lad of tender years is a      match for the police in such a contest. He needs counsel and      support if he is not to become the victim first of fear, then      of panic. He needs someone on whom to lean lest the      overpowering presence of the law, as he knows it, crush him.      No friend stood at the side of this 15-year-old boy as the      police, working in relays, questioned him hour after hour,      from midnight until dawn. No lawyer stood guard to make sure      that the police went so far and no farther, to see to it that      they stopped short of the point where he became the victim of      coercion. No counsel or friend was called during the critical      hours of questioning. A photographer was admitted once this      lad broke and confessed. But not even a gesture towards      getting a lawyer for him was ever made.'\n\n\n13\nThe fact that petitioner was only 14 years old puts this case on the same footing as Haley v. Ohio, supra. There was here no evidence of prolonged questioning. But the five-day detention\u2014during which time the boy's mother unsuccessfully tried to see him and he was cut off from contact with any lawyer or adult advisor\u2014gives the case an ominous cast. The prosecution says that the boy was advised of his right to counsel, but that he did not ask either for a lawyer or for his parents. But a 14-year-old boy, no matter how sophisticated, is unlikely to have any conception of what will confront him when he is made accessible only to the police. That is to say, we deal with a person who is not equal to the police in knowledge and understanding of the consequences of the questions and answers being recorded and who is unable to know how to protest his own interests or how to get the benefits of his constitutional rights.\n\n\n14\nThe prosecution says that the youth and immaturity of the petitioner and the five-day detention are irrelevant, because the basic ingredients of the confession came tumbling out as soon as he was arrested. But if we took that position, it would, with all deference, be in callous disregard of this boy's constitutional rights. He cannot be compared with an adult in full possession of his senses and knowledgeable of the consequences of his admissions. He would have no way of knowing what the consequences of his confession were without advice as to his rights\u2014from someone concerned with securing him those rights\u2014and without the aid of more mature judgment as to the steps he should take in the predicament in which he found himself. A lawyer or an adult relative or friend could have given the petitioner the protection which his own immaturity could not. Adult advice would have put him on a less unequal footing with his interrogators. Without some adult protection against this inequality, a 14-year-old boy would not be able to know, let alone assert, such constitutional rights as he had. To allow this conviction to stand would, in effect, be to treat him as if he had no constitutional rights.\n\n\n15\nThere is no guide to the decision of cases such as this, except the totality of circumstances that bear on the two factors we have mentioned. The youth of the petitioner, the long detention, the failure to send for his parents, the failure immediately to bring him before the judge of the Juvenile Court, the failure to see to it that he had the advice of a lawyer or a friend\u2014all these combine to make us conclude that the formal confession on which this conviction may have rested (see Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U.S. 560, 568, 78 S.Ct. 844, 850, 2 L.Ed.2d 975) was obtained in violation of due process.\n\n\n16\nReversed.\n\n\n17\nMr. Justice FRANKFURTER and Mr. Justice WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n18\nMr. Justice CLARK, with whom Mr. Justice HARLAN and Mr. Justice STEWART join, dissenting.\n\n\n19\nAs Chief Justice John Marshall said a century and a quarter ago, '(i)f courts were permitted to indulge their sympathies, a case better calculated to excite them can scarcely be imagined.' Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 15, 8 L.Ed. 25 (1831). A 14-year-old boy stands convicted of murder and has been sentenced to imprisonment for life. But, as Mr. Justice Paterson said in Penhallow v. Donane's Admr., 3 Dall. 54, 88\u201489, 1 L.Ed. 507 (1795), 'motives of commiseration, from whatever source they flow, must not mingle in the administration of justice.'\n\n\n20\nThe Court sets aside the conviction here on due process grounds, finding that the formal confession made by petitioner on January 7 was obtained by 'secret inquisitorial processes' and other forms of compulsion. In so doing it turns its back on the spontaneous oral admissions made by petitioner at the time of arrest on January 1, as well as a detailed confession made the next day, all long before the formal confession was given five days later. Moreover, I find nothing in the record that suggests any 'secret inquisitorial processes' were used or any compulsion was exerted upon petitioner even during that longer period. With due deference I cannot see how the Court concludes from the record that petitioner was 'cut off from contact with any lawyer or adult advisor' and 'made accessible only to the police,' that there was a failure to bring him before the juvenile judge in the manner required in juvenile delinquency cases, or that Gallegos' case is in anywise on the same footing with Haley v. Ohio, 332 U.S. 596, 68 S.Ct. 302, 92 L.Ed. 224 (1948), or the other cases cited by the majority.\n\n\n21\nAs the Court says, 'the totality of circumstances' is the only guide we have in confession cases. However, in view of the hop, skip, and jump fashion in which the Court deals with them here, I believe it is first necessary to detail the facts.\n\n\n22\nThe record through the testimony of Officer Chism, a special juvenile officer, shows that on Thursday evening, January 1, he was investigating the assault on Mr. Smith,1 an 80-year-old man, when he noticed three boys who appeared to fit the description furnished him of the ones involved. The three, who were sitting on the curb outside of Dutchman's Inn, were the Gallegos brothers: petitioner Robert (14), Charles (12), and Richard (8). The officer, who was alone and in street clothes, stopped his car across the street from the inn. He approached the boys, told them he was a police officer, and asked them to come over and sit in his car. They did so and the officer asked them about the Smith assault. Richard orally confessed, and the petitioner 'admitted he had a part in it.' Officer Chism then took the boys to Juvenile Hall where the petitioner again admitted his participation, as did his youngest brother, Richard. Both stated that the third brother, Charles, had nothing to do with the matter, but that their cousin, Eddie Martinez, had accompanied them. Charles, having been cleared of any involvement in the assault, was taken home that very evening by Officer Chism, who told Mrs. Gallagos that the petitioner and Richard were being held at Juvenile Hall and that visiting hours were on Monday and Thursday evenings. He also informed her of her sons' right to counsel.\n\n\n23\nThe next evening, January 2, Officer Chism talked to the petitioner, Richard, and Martinez, who by this time was also at Juvenile Hall. As the officer took notes,2 petitioner again described his participation in the assault on Mr. Smith in the following manner as narrated by Officer Chism at the trial:\n\n\n24\n'(After his participation in an assault on a Mr. Kruhd,) he      proceeded down to 18th and Curtis Street where he was shining      shoes. * * * (U)pon seeing an old man, who was later      identified as Robert F. Smith, he followed him to a hotel on      18th street. * * * (H)e * * * was with his younger brother,      Richard, and one Eddie Martinez. * * * They followed the old      man to the hotel and Richard stayed downstairs and watched      out for cops. He and Eddie went upstairs and they lost track      of the old man; they asked several if they had seen his      grandfather come in, that he had just come in and was drunk *      * * (and) a man told * * * (them) he just went down the      hallway, and upon knocking on the door a man opened the door      and he told him he was looking for his grandfather, that he      was drunk, and the man told him the old man next door had just come in. He said upon      knocking on the other door someone told him to come in, that      he opened the door and he seen it was the man he was looking      for. * * * (A)t that time Eddie Martinez asked the old man      for a drink of water and when the old man brought the water      Eddie grabbed him and he, Robert, hit the old man about the      head and face with a shoe brush; that when the old man fell      to the floor he took a knife and held it to the old man's      throat and took his billfold out (of) his back pocket. * * *      (T)hey all left then and went to the Twenty-third Street      Viaduct where he gave Eddie $3.00 and he kept $10.00 to split      between him and Richard and they then went home * * *.'\n\n\n25\nThat same evening, January 2, at 11:30 p.m., Mrs. Gallegos attempted to visit her two sons at Juvenile Hall but was again informed that visiting hours were 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Mondays and Thursdays. At the trial she testified that she made no effort to see her sons on the next visiting day, which was Monday, but waited until Thursday, January 8.\n\n\n26\nThe record shows that on January 3 the officer filed in the juvenile court a detailed report of the arrest and petitioner's confessions together with a petition charging petitioner with juvenile delinquency. This was supplemented on the 5th by the report of the Kruhd assault and Kruhd's identification of petitioner and the other boys. The officer followed, as he was obliged to do, the juvenile court law of Colorado which provides for commitment in Juvenile Hall, report to the juvenile judge who supervises the Hall and its inmates, and the filing of a delinquency petition.\n\n\n27\nFor the first few days at Juvenile Hall petitioner was placed in 'security,' which meant that he did not participate in the school program. The uncontradicted testimony of the Hall Superintendent was that the decision to keep the petitioner out of the program was made by his unit supervisor in order to size up the boy, who had been charged with a serious crime, before placing him in the regular activities with the others. During this time he had all his meals with the other boys and conversed with his younger brother who was held in another ward. Although the petitioner did not testify at the trial in the presence of the jury, he admitted at a hearing held to determine the admissibility of the formal confession that he was only questioned three times between January 1 and January 7 and that no threats or physical coercion was used at any time.\n\n\n28\nOn January 7 the police department sent a man over to formalize the earlier confessions. Officer Miller, who took the confession, testified that he told petitioner of the possibility of a murder charge, warned him that he did not have to make a statement, and told him that he could have his parents and an attorney present if he desired. Petitioner indicated that he did not so desire and a formal confession was taken which was substantially identical to the statement given on January 2, as related by Officer Chism in his testimony. The confession was typed, and Officer Chism took it over to Juvenile Hall for petitioner to sign. He testified that petitioner read it aloud before signing it. Above his signature was the admission that the confession was made voluntarily and upon warning that it could be used against him.\n\n\n29\nOn January 16 the three assailants were committed to the Industrial School by the juvenile court. Upon the death of Mr. Smith, petitioner on information was tried for murder. As noted above, the evidence included testimony of his admissions upon arrest and his confession on January 2, as well as the formal confession of January 7. These were admitted after independent findings of voluntariness by the trial judge and jury. The latter was instructed that in determining whether petitioner freely and voluntarily made the confessions it was to take into account 'the age, maturity, physical and mental condition of the defendant, the length of his confinement, his opportunity or lack of opportunity to seek friendly or professional aid, the advice or lack of advice given him as to his constitutional rights, and all other facts and circumstances surrounding such confession.'\n\n\n30\nBefore discussing the admissibility of the formal confession of January 7, I must first comment on the Court's treatment of the earlier confessions, viz., those of January 1 and 2. Although the Court carefully refrains from holding these confessions inadmissible under due process standards, its innuendo that they were acquired 'in callous disregard of this boy's constitutional rights' cannot pass unexposed. In regard to these confessions, the test of voluntariness as evidenced by the 'totality of circumstances' leads the Court not to question them. Here there were no 'secret inquisitorial processes' or compulsion of any kind as the Court envisions in relation to the confession of January 7. The Court's only criticism is that petitioner 'would have no way of knowing what the consequences of his confession were without advice as to his rights * * *.'3 The truth of the matter is that the singular circumstance pointed out by the Court has never been thought to render a confession inadmissible. See Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568, 577\u2014602, 81 S.Ct. 1860, 1865, 6 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1961) (opinion of Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER).\n\n\n31\nThe Court is overturning petitioner's conviction because it flows in part from the formal confession of January 7. I cannot draw from this record a conclusion that this confession was involuntary. Petitioner freely admitted in testimony before the trial judge that he was not threatened or physically coerced in any way and that he was not intensively questioned. Moreover, prior to the formal confession he was told that he did not have to make a statement and warned of the possibility of a murder charge, as well as informed that he could have an attorney and his parents present. Officer Chism's testimony as to this matter was documented by the confession itself which recites that it was voluntary and given after notice that it could be used against him.\n\n\n32\nPetitioner was never placed in solitary confinement, as might be implied from the Court's opinion, but was merely kept out of the organized activities until the unit supervisor could determine whether his full-time participation would have an adverse effect on others. And even under this schedule he had all his meals with the other boys and conversed freely with them.\n\n\n33\nNor was petitioner 'cut off' from contact with lawyers or adults and 'made accessible only to the police.' His mother made no effort to obtain an attorney although informed of the right to do so.4 And she was not prevented from seeing him but was merely asked to comply with reasonable visiting regulations. She was informed on two occasions that she could see him Monday, January 5, two days before the formal confession which the Court finds invalid, but she did not attempt to do so. And petitioner himself passed up the offer to confer with his parents and an attorney before making this confession.\n\n\n34\nIn support of the above factors indicating that the confession of January 7 was voluntary is the undeniable fact that petitioner admitted on January 1 his participation in the assault and confessed in detail thereto on January 2. Both of these statements occurred prior to the events which the Court finds to have coerced the confession of January 7. I am hard pressed to understand how one could conclude that the police found it expedient to coerce the January 7 confession or that the events discussed by the Court rendered it involuntary when five days earlier a substantially identical confession was made in the absence of the 'coercive' events.\n\n\n35\nAs I have noted, in light of these facts I cannot conclude that this confession was involuntary. A fortiori, I could not determine, as the Court must, that so clear a case of coercion was made out that three prior findings that the confession was voluntary\u2014including one by the jury which was specifically instructed to consider each of the factors relied on by the majority\u2014can be reversed. I have carefully examined the cases upon which the Court relies and can find not one among them which in the least is apposite. There were no 'secret inquisitorial processes' as in Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227, 60 S.Ct. 472, 84 L.Ed. 716 (1940). There Chambers, a Negro, for a week after arrest was kept incommunicado, moved from one jail to another, constantly questioned, and was finally subjected to around-the-clock interrogation by a relay of from 4 to 10 persons. Nor does Leyra v. Denno, 347 U.S. 556, 74 S.Ct. 716, 98 L.Ed. 948 (1954), in any way resemble this case. There the accused had requested a doctor in order to get relief from a painful sinus attack. The police brought in a psychiatrist who by subtle means induced him to confess after an hour or two of questioning. The state court found this confession invalid because of mental coercion. However, at the second trial subsequent confessions were admitted in evidence. This Court held that the psychiatric inducement used to extract the first confession poisoned and invalidated the subsequent ones. Likewise, the reference of the Court to Chief Justice Hughes' statement in Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278, 285, 56 S.Ct. 461, 464, 80 L.Ed. 682 (1936), concerning the 'element of compulsion which is condemned by the Fifth Amendment,' is misleading and inapposite. 'The question in this case,' he said in Brown with his usual conciseness, 'is whether convictions, which rest solely upon confessions shown to have been extorted by officers of the state by brutality and violence, are consistent with the due process of law required by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.' Id., at 279, 56 S.Ct. at 462. Brown and the other suspects, the Chief Justice pointed out, had been stripped, laid over chairs and beaten with a leather strap with buckles until their backs were cut to pieces and they confessed. Nor does the holding in Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U.S. 143, 64 S.Ct. 921, 88 L.Ed. 1192 (1944), have any bearing on this case. It also involved 'prosecutors serving in relays' keeping a person under continuous cross-examination for 36 hours without rest or sleep. Nor can it, in my view, be said that Spano v. New York, 360 U.S. 315, 79 S.Ct. 1202, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265 (1959), has any weight under the facts here. In that case continuous, all-night cross-examination by four officers, the refusal of repeated requests to consult his counsel, together with the use of an old friend who was a fledgling police officer as bait to break down the accused, led us to invalidate the confession. And in Malinski v. New York, 324 U.S. 401, 65 S.Ct. 781, 89 L.Ed. 1029 (1945), the accused was stripped of his clothing and his request for counsel ignored while he remained in solitary confinement and without food until, led to believe that he was going to get a 'shellacking,' he confessed from apparent fear of his jailors. Finally, I see no similarity in Haley v. Ohio, 332 U.S. 596, 68 S.Ct. 302, 92 L.Ed. 224 (1948), the last case cited by the Court. There a 15-year-old boy never before in trouble was questioned 'through the dead of night' by five to six policemen in relays of one or two each and then only was led to confess by being shown alleged statements of two confederates incriminating him. Haley does not indicate that youth alone is sufficient to render a juvenile's confession inadmissible. Here we do not have any of the factors which led to the comment: 'What transpired would make us pause for careful inquiry if a mature man were involved.' Id., at 599, 68 S.Ct. at 303.\n\n\n36\nI regret that without support from prior cases and on the basis of inference and conjecture not supported in the record the Court upsets this conviction.\n\n\n\n1\n At this time Smith was still alive. He died on January 26, and the murder prosecution here at issue followed.\n\n\n2\n These notes were signed by petitioner.\n\n\n3\n There is no basis for the Court's suggestion that the officers improperly failed to bring petitioner before the juvenile judge when they first arrested him. The procedure used in Denver of filing a report with the juvenile judge and temporarily placing the offender in Juvenile Hall pending a hearing is in keeping with advanced procedures being followed with reference to juvenile offenders throughout the United States.\n\n\n4\n Indeed, no attorney was obtained for petitioner's trial in the juvenile court.\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"380 U.S. 63\n85 S.Ct. 754\n13 L.Ed.2d 658\nUNITED STATES, Petitioner,v.Jackie Hamilton GAINEY.\nNo. 13.\nArgued Oct. 15, 1964.\nDecided March 1, 1965.\n\nLouis F. Claiborne, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nJoseph H. Davis, Macon, Ga., for respondent.\nMr. Justice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nAfter a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, respondent Jackie Gainey was convicted of violating 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5601 (a)(1) (possession, custody or control of a set up, unregistered still and distilling apparatus) and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5601(a)(4) (carrying on 'the business of a distiller or rectifier without having given bond as required by law').1 In the course of his instructions the trial judge informed the jury of two statutory provisions which authorize a jury to infer guilt of the substantive offenses from the fact of a defendant's unexplained presence at the site of an illegal still.2 The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the convictions on the ground that these statutory inferences are unconstitutional,3 because it thought the connection between unexplained presence at an illegal still and the substantive offenses of 'possession' and 'carrying on' is insufficiently rational to satisfy the due process requirements formulated by this Court in Tot v. United States, 319 U.S. 463, 63 S.Ct. 1241, 87 L.Ed. 1519. We granted certiorari, sub nom. United States v. Barrett, to review the exercise of the grave power of annulling an Act of Congress. 375 U.S. 962, 84 S.Ct. 489, 11 L.Ed.2d 413.\n\n\n2\nIf either statutory inference is valid, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed, because concurrent sentences were imposed by the District Court. Emspak v. United States, 349 U.S. 190, 195, 75 S.Ct. 687, 690, 99 L.Ed. 997; Sinclair v. United States, 279 U.S. 263, 299, 49 S.Ct. 268, 273, 73 L.Ed. 692 (1929). We find the inference authorized by \u00a7 5601(b)(2) constitutionally permissible, and therefore reverse the judgment without reaching the validity of \u00a7 5601(b)(1).\n\n\n3\nThe legislative record shows that Congress enacted these provisions because of 'the practical impossibility of proving * * * actual participation in the illegal activities except by inference drawn from (the defendant's) presence when the illegal acts were committed * * *.'4 The statutes were passed against a backdrop of varying formulations among the Circuits of the standards which should shape a trial judge's instructions to a jury in telling it what weight to accord the fact of a defendant's unexplained presence at an illegal still site. Long before 1958, the year the statutes were enacted, trial judges had been instructing juries that a defendant's presence at a still could be considered by them in determining whether the defendant had participated in carrying on the illegal operation. Barton v. United States, 267 F. 174, 175 176 (C.A.4th Cir.). Compare Wilson v. United States, 162 U.S. 613, 16 S.Ct. 895, 40 L.Ed. 1090. The Fourth Circuit had endorsed such a charge. Barton v. United States, supra. In the Third and Fifth Circuits the precedents were less clear. See Graceffo v. United States, 46 F.2d 852 (C.A.3d Cir.); Fowler v. United States, 234 F.2d 697, 699 (C.A.5th Cir.).\n\n\n4\nThe variations among the courts of appeals concerned the reasonableness of inferring guilt of the substantive offense from the fact of unexplained presence at the site of the criminal enterprise. It is that question which Congress has now resolved in favor of the established practice of trial judges to include the inference in their charges.5 And it is the same question of reasonableness which the petitioner asks this Court to determine in passing on the constitutionality of \u00a7 5601(b)(2).\n\n\n5\nAs the Court of Appeals correctly stated in this case, the constitutionality of the legislation depends upon the rationality of the connection 'between the facts proved and the ultimate fact presumed.' Tot v. United States, 319 U.S. 463, 466, 63 S.Ct. 1241. The process of making the determination of rationality is, by its nature, highly empirical, and in matters not within specialized judicial competence or completely commonplace, significant weight should be accorded the capacity of Congress to amass the stuff of actual experience and cull conclusions from it. As the record in the Circuits shows, courts have differed in assessing the weight to be placed upon the fact of the defendant's unexplained presence at a still. See United States v. Freeman, 286 F.2d 262 (C.A.4th Cir.). Yet it is precisely when courts have been unable to agree as to the exact relevance of a frequently occurring fact in an atmosphere pregnant with illegality that Congress' resolution is appropriate.\n\n\n6\nThe rationality of the inference provided by \u00a7 5601(b)(2) must be viewed in the context of the broad substantive offense it supports. Section 5601(a)(4) proscribes 'carrying on' the enterprise of illegal distillation\u2014an offense which is one of the most comprehensive of the criminal statutes designed to stop the production and sale of untaxed liquor. See Vukich v. United States, 28 F.2d 666, 669 (C.A.9th Cir.). Those who aid and abet the enterpriser come within the statute's reach by virtue of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1958 ed.). United States v. Giuliano, 263 F.2d 582 (C.A.3d Cir.). Suppliers, haulers, and a host of other functionaries have been convicted under the statute. See United States v. Pritchard, 55 F.Supp. 201 (D.C.W.D.S.C.), aff'd, 145 F.2d 240 (C.A.4th Cir.). Congress was undoubtedly aware that manufacturers of illegal liquor are notorious for the deftness with which they locate arcane spots for plying their trade. Legislative recognition of the implications of seclusion only confirms what the folklore teaches\u2014that strangers to the illegal business rarely penetrate the curtain of secrecy.6 We therefore hold that \u00a7 5601(b) (2) satisfies the test of Tot v. United States, supra.\n\n\n7\nBut it is said that this statute is unconstitutional upon a different ground\u2014that it impinges upon the trial judge's powers over the judicial proceeding. We cannot agree. Our Constitution places in the hands of the trial judge the responsibility for safeguarding the integrity of the jury trial, including the right to have a case withheld from the jury when the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support a conviction. The statute before us deprives the trial judge of none of his normal judicial powers. We do not interpret the provision in the statute that unexplained 'presence * * * shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction' as in any way invading the province of the judge's discretion. The language permits the judge to submit a case to the jury on the basis of the accused's presence alone, and to this extent it constitutes congressional recognition that the fact of presence does have probative worth in the determination of guilt. But where the only evidence is of presence the statute does not require the judge to submit the case to the jury, nor does it preclude the grant of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. And the Court of Appeals may still review the trial judge's denial of motions for a directed verdict or for a judgment n.o.v.\n\n\n8\nThe statute does not prevent the jury from being 'properly instructed on the standards for reasonable doubt.' Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 139, 75 S.Ct. 127, 139, 99 L.Ed. 150. In this case, the trial judge instructed the jury as follows:\n\n\n9\n'There is one other matter which I should mention. I charge      you that the presence of defendants at a still, if proved,      with or without flight therefrom, or attempted flight      therefrom, if proved, would be a circumstance for you to      consider along with all the other testimony in the case. Of      course, the bare presence at a distillery and flight      therefrom of an innocent man is not in and of itself enough      to make him guilty. It is possible under the law for an      innocent man to be present at a distillery, and it is      possible for him to run when about to be apprehended, and      such an innocent man ought never to be convicted, but      presence at a distillery, if you think these men were      present, is a circumstance to be considered along with all      the other circumstances in the case in determining whether      they were connected with the distillery or not. Did they have      any equipment with them that was necessary at the distillery?      What was the hour of day that they were there? Did the      officers see them do anything? Did they make any statements?\n\n\n10\n'It is your duty to explore this case, analyze the evidence      pro and con fairly. Presence at a still, together with other      circumstances in the case, if they are sufficient in your      opinion to exclude every reasonable conclusion except that      they were there connected with the distillery, in an illegal      manner, * * * carrying on the business as charged * * *, if      you believe those things, would authorize you in finding the      defendants guilty.\n\n\n11\n'And under a statute enacted by Congress a few years back,      when a person is on trial for * * * carrying on the business      of a distiller without giving bond as required by law, as      charged in this case, and the defendant is shown to have been at the site of the place * *      * where and at the time when the business of a distiller was      engaged in or carried on without bond having been given,      under the law such presence of the defendant shall be deemed      sufficient evidence to authorize conviction, unless the      defendant by the evidence in the case and by proven facts and      circumstances explains such presence to the satisfaction of      the jury.\n\n\n12\n'Now this does not mean that the presence of the defendant at      the site and place at the time referred to requires the jury      to convict the defendant, if the defendant by the evidence in      the case, facts and circumstances proved, fails to explain      his presence to the satisfaction of the jury. It simply means      that a jury may, if it sees fit, convict upon such evidence,      as it shall be deemed in law sufficient to authorize a      conviction, but does not require such a result.' (Emphasis      supplied.)\n\n\n13\nThe jury was thus specifically told that the statutory inference was not conclusive. 'Presence' was one circumstance to be considered among many. Even if it found that the defendant had been present at the still, and that his presence remained unexplained, the jury could nonetheless acquit him if it found that the Government had not proved his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Holland v. United States, supra. In the absence of the statute, such an instruction to the jury would surely have been permissible. Cf. Wilson v. United States, supra. Furthermore, in the context of the instructions as a whole, we do not consider that the single phrase 'unless the defendant by the evidence in the case and by proven facts and circumstances explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury' can be fairly understood as a comment on the petitioner's failure to testify.7 Cf. Bruno v. United States, 308 U.S. 287, 60 S.Ct. 198, 84 L.Ed. 257. The judge's overall reference was carefully directed to the evidence as a whole, with neither allusion nor innuendo based on the defendant's decision not to take the stand.\n\n\n14\nIn McNamara v. Henkel, 226 U.S. 520, 525, 33 S.Ct. 146, 147, 57 L.Ed. 330, the Court approved a proceeding which did no more than 'accord to the evidence, if unexplained, its natural probative force.' That is all that Congress has done here. We cannot find that the law it enacted violates the Constitution.\n\n\n15\nReversed.\n\n\n16\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting in part.\n\n\n17\nThe statute which the Court finds constitutional provides:\n\n\n18\n'Whenever on trial for violation of subsection (a)(4) (making      it an offense to carry on the business of a distiller or      rectifier without having given bond as required by law) the      defendant is shown to have been at the site or place where,      and at the time when, the business of a distiller or      rectifier was so engaged in or carried on, such presence of      the defendant shall be deemed sufficient evidence to      authorize conviction, unless the defendant explains such      presence to the satisfaction of the jury (or of the court      when tried without jury).' 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5601(b)(2).\n\n\n19\nIt would be possible to interpret the statute as compelling judges to give the following instruction to juries: 'If you find that the defendant was present at the still, then the law requires you to assume that he was there carrying on the business of a distiller within the meaning of the statute; but you need not make this assumption if the defendant has given another explanation of his presence there and you are satisfied of the truth of that explanation.' If the statute were read as compelling such an instruction, I would find it constitutionally intolerable, for the reasons so well stated by my Brother BLACK.\n\n\n20\nThe Court, however, interprets the statute as merely allowing, not compelling, the jury to draw the inference of 'carrying on' from the fact of 'presence.' The jury is left free to reject the inference if, in light of all the circumstances of the case, a reasonable doubt remains as to the defendant's guilt. That is the way the jury would normally function, apart from the statute. So, I have concluded that the statute, as construed, merely provides a rule of evidence and no more.\n\n\n21\nThere are, to be sure, dangers inherent in any statutory presumption. Perhaps the jury will be overawed if it is told that some particular factual inference has been enshrined in an Act of Congress. Therefore the Court quite rightly suggests that the better practice would be to omit 'any explicit reference to the statute itself in the charge.' Ante, p. 71, n. 7. Or perhaps the judge may feel that the statute restricts his power to withhold an insufficient case from the jury or to grant a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Court reassures the trial judge that the statute does not thus invade the province of his discretion. Nor is the function of the appellate courts in any way circumscribed.\n\n\n22\nIn my view, the acute danger in the statute as construed and applied lurks in its provision that the jury may draw the inference in question 'unless the defendant explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury * * *.' (Emphasis supplied.) If this meant that the judge should instruct that the inference may be drawn unless the defendant himself becomes a witness and personally explains his presence at the still, then, as my Brother BLACK says, the statute would clearly subject the defendant to an impermissible compulsion to testify. But more subtly compelling instructions than that are outlawed by the same policy. It has long been the rule in the federal courts that the defendant's failure to testify ought not to be even the subject of unfavorable comment:\n\n\n23\n'It is not every one who can safely venture on the witness      stand, though entirely innocent of the charge against him.      Excessive timidity, nervousness when facing others and      attempting to explain transactions of a suspicious character,      and offences charged against him, will often confuse and      embarrass him to such a degree as to increase rather than      remove prejudices against him. * * * (C)ounsel is forbidden      by the statute (now 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3481)* to make any comment      which would create or tend to create a presumption against      the defendant from his failure to testify.' Wilson v. United      States, 149 U.S. 60, 66\u201467, 13 S.Ct. 765, 766\u2014767, 37 L.Ed.      650.\n\n\n24\nJust as it is improper for counsel to argue from the defendant's silence, so is it improper for the trial judge to call attention to the fact of defendant's silence. Indeed, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3481 the defendant is entitled as a matter of right to have the trial judge expressly tell the jury that it must not attach any improtance to the defendant's failure to testify; or, if the defendant sees fit, he may choose to have no mention made of his silence by anyone. Bruno v. United States, 308 U.S. 287, 60 S.Ct. 198, 84 L.Ed. 257.\n\n\n25\nI have previously expressed my view that this rule against comment on the defendant's silence is mandated by the Fifth Amendment, because '(u)sing a defendant's silence as evidence against him is one way of having him testify against himself.' Scott v. California, 364 U.S. 471, 472, 81 S.Ct. 245, 5 L.Ed.2d 222 (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n26\nThe charge in the present case does not, in my view, satisfy the requirements of the Fifth Amendment. The judge told the jury that the inference could be drawn 'unless the defendant by the evidence in the case and by proven facts and circumstances explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury.' I believe the charge in that form runs counter to the federal policy that forbids conviction on compelled testimony, not only because, as my Brother BLACK points out, it puts direct pressure on the defendant to come forward and testify, but also because it amounts in practical effect to an improper comment on the defendant's silence where, as here, he resists the pressure and does not take the stand in his own behalf. Unlike the Court, therefore, I would not interpret the statute before us as attempting a pro tanto repeal of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3481 by authorizing such an instruction.\n\n\n27\nMr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n\n\n28\nRespondent Gainey was tried and convicted of possession of an unregistered still1 and of carrying on the business of a distiller without having given bond2 in violation of a federal statute. Other provisions of the statute3 entitled 'Presumptions,' declare that presence at the site of such a distillery 'shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction, unless the defendant explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury * * *.' At the trial federal and state officers testified, among other things, that they had seen Gainey at a still site. Gainey did not testify. The trial court, quite appropriately if the foregoing provisions are valid, instructed the jury that Gainey's unexplained presence at the still was 'deemed in law sufficient' to convict. I think that the statutory provisions which authorize such a charge deprived Gainey (1) of his constitutional right to trial by jury, guaranteed him both in Art. III, \u00a7 2, and in the Sixth Amendment; (2) of due process of law guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment, which includes the right to be tried for a crime in a court according to the law of the land, without any interference with that court's judicial functions by the Congress; and (3) of his right guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment not to be compelled to be a witness against himself.\n\n\n29\nFirst of all, let me say that I am at a loss to understand the Court's puzzling statement that 'where the only evidence is of presence the statute does not require the judge to submit the case to the jury, nor does it preclude the grant of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.' The provisions in question both say unqualifiedly that 'presence of the defendant shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction' unless the defendant explains his presence. The Court holds that this statutory command in \u00a7 5601(b)(2) is valid,4 but then for some reason adds that judges are free to ignore it or, after telling juries that they may rely on it, are free to set aside the verdicts of those juries which do. In other words, under the Court's holding the judge is left free to take the extraordinary course of following a valid statute or not, as he chooses. Judges are not usually given such unlimited discretion to disregard valid statutes. And as the Court indicates elsewhere in its opinion, it was to prevent judges from setting aside jury verdicts based on presence alone that Congress passed this statute in the first place. Besides being almost self-contradictory, it amounts to an emasculation of those statutory provisions, I think, to say that the judge was not required to tell the jury about them. But whether or not he was bound to do so, the fact is that here he did, and so this jury deliberated with the judge's solemn instruction that Congress had decided that proof of mere unexplained presence at a still was sufficient to convict Gainey of having illegally possessed it or carried on its business. Few jurors could have failed to believe that it was their duty to convict under this charge if presence was proved, and few judges could have failed to believe it was their duty to uphold such a conviction, even though all of them in a particular case might have felt that mere presence alone was not enough to show guilt.\n\n\n30\nIt has always been recognized that the guaranty of trial by jury in criminal cases means that the jury is to be the factfinder. This is the only way in which a jury can perform its basic constitutional function of determining the guilt or innocence of a defendant. See, e.g., United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U.S. 11, 15\u201419, 76 S.Ct. 1, 4\u20146, 100 L.Ed. 8; Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 5\u201410, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1224\u20141227 (opinion announcing judgment). And of course this constitutionally established power of a jury to determine guilt or innocence of a defendant charged with crime cannot be taken away by Congress, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part. Obviously, a necessary part of this power, vested by the Constitution in juries (or in judges when juries are waived), is the exclusive right to decide whether evidence presented at trial is sufficient to convict. I think it flaunts the constitutional power of courts and juries for Congress to tell them what 'shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction.' And if Congress could not thus directly encroach upon the judge's or jury's exclusive right to declare what evidence is sufficient to prove the facts necessary for conviction, it should not be allowed to do so merely by labeling its encroachment a 'presumption.' Neither Tot v. United States, 319 U.S. 463, 63 S.Ct. 1241, 87 L.Ed. 1519, relied on by the Court as supporting this presumption, nor any case cited in Tot approved such an encroachment on the power of judges or juries. In fact, so far as I can tell, the problem of whether Congress can so restrict the power of court and jury in a criminal case in a federal court has never been squarely presented to or considered by this Court, perhaps because challenges to presumptions have arisen in many crucially different contexts but nevertheless have generally failed to distinguish between presumptions used in different ways, treating them as if they are either all valid or all invalid, regardless of the rights on which their use may impinge. Because the Court also fails to differentiate among the different circumstances in which presumptions may be utilized and the different consequences which will follow, I feel it necessary to say a few words on that subject before considering specifically the validity of the use of these presumptions in the light of the circumstances and consequences of their use.\n\n\n31\nIn its simplest form a presumption is an inference permitted or required by law of the existence of one fact, which is unknown or which cannot be proved, from another fact which has been proved. The fact presumed may be based on a very strong probability, a weak supposition or an arbitrary assumption. The burden on the party seeking to prove the fact may be slight, as in a civil suit, or very heavy\u2014proof beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014as in a criminal prosecution. This points up the fact that statutes creating presumptions cannot be treated as fungible, that is, as interchangeable for all uses and all purposes. The validity of each presumption must be determined in the light of the particular consequences that flow from its use. When matters of trifling moment are involved, presumptions may be more freely accepted, but when consequences of vital importance to litigants and to the administration of justice are at stake, a more careful scrutiny is necessary.\n\n\n32\nIn judging the constitutionality of legislatively created presumptions this Court has evolved an initial criterion which applies alike to all kinds of presumptions: that before a presumption may be relied on, there must be a rational connection between the facts inferred and the facts which have been proved by competent evidence, that is, the facts proved must be evidence which is relevant, tending to prove (though not necessarily conclusively) the existence of the fact presumed. And courts have undoubtedly shown an inclination to be less strict about the logical strength of presumptive inferences they will permit in civil cases than about those which affect the trial of crimes. The stricter scrutiny in the latter situation follows from the fact that the burden of proof in a civil lawsuit is ordinarily merely a preponderance of the evidence, while in a criminal case where a man's life, liberty, or property is at stake, the prosecution must prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See Morrison v. People of State of California, 291 U.S. 82; 96\u201497, 54 S.Ct. 281, 287, 78 L.Ed. 664. The case of Bailey v. State of Alabama, 219 U.S. 219, 31 S.Ct. 145, 55 L.Ed. 191, is a good illustration of this principle. There Bailey was accused of violating an Alabama statute which made it a crime to fail to perform personal services after obtaining money by contracting to perform them, with an intent to defraud the employer. The statute also provided that refusal or failure to perform the services, or to refund money paid for them, without just cause, constituted 'prima facie evidence' (i.e., gave rise to a presumption) of the intent to injure or defraud. This Court, after calling attention to prior cases dealing with the requirement of rationality, passed over the test of rationality and held the statute invalid on another ground. Looking beyond the rational-relationship doctrine the Court held that the use of this presumption by Alabama against a man accused of crime would amount to a violation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids 'involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime.' In so deciding the Court made it crystal clear that rationality is only the first hurdle which a legislatively created presumption must clear\u2014that a presumption, even if rational, cannot be used to convict a man of crime if the effect of using the presumption is to deprive the accused of a constitutional right. In Bailey the constitutional right was given by the Thirteenth Amendment. In the case before us the accused, in my judgment, has been denied his right to the kind of trial by jury guaranteed by Art. III, \u00a7 2, and the Sixth Amendment, as well as to due process of law and freedom from self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. And of course the priciple announced in the Bailey case was not limited to rights guaranteed by the Thirteenth Amendment. The Court said in Bailey:\n\n\n33\n'It is apparent that a constitutional prohibition cannot be      transgressed indirectly by the creation of a statutory      presumption any more than it can be violated by direct      enactment. The power to create presumptions is not a means of      escape from constitutional restrictions.' 219 U.S., at 239,      31 S.Ct., at 151.\n\n\n34\nThus the Court held that presumptions, while often valid (and some of which, I think, like the presumption of death based on long unexplained absence, may perhaps be even salutary in effect), must not be allowed to stand where they abridge or deny a specific constitutional guarantee. It is one thing to rely on a presumption to justify conditional administration of the estate of a person absent without explanation for seven years, see Cunnius v. Reading School District, 198 U.S. 458, 25 S.Ct. 721, 49 L.Ed. 1125; compare Scott v. McNeal, 154 U.S. 34, 14 S.Ct. 1108, 38 L.Ed. 896; it would be quite another to use the presumption of death from seven years' absence to convict a man of murder. I do not think it can be denied that use of the statutory presumptions in the case before us at the very least seriously impaired Gainey's constitutional right to have a jury weigh the facts of his case without any congressional interference through predetermination of what evidence would be sufficient to prove the facts necessary to convict in a particular case.\n\n\n35\nThe Bailey case also emphatically answers the Court's insistence that this encroachment on Gainey's constitutional rights was justified or neutralized by the trial court's instruction that while evidence of unexplained presence was sufficient under the statute to convict, the jury nonetheless was not compelled to convict. This same kind of contention was made to this Court and rejected in Bailey where the Alabama Supreme Court had upheld that State's presumption on the ground that 'with such evidence before them, the jury are still left free to find the accused guilty or not guilty, according as they may be satisfied of his guilt or not, by the whole evidence.' Bailey v. State, 161 Ala. 75, 78, 49 So. 886, 887. This Court answered that contention then, as I think it should now, saying:\n\n\n36\n'The point is that, in such a case, the statute authorizes      the jury to convict. It is not enough to say that the jury      may not accept that evidence as alone sufficient; for the      jury may accept it, and they have the express warrant of the      statute to accept it is as a basis for their verdict.' 219      U.S., at 235, 31 S.Ct., at 149. (Emphasis in original.)\n\n\n37\nAnd the Court added that 'The normal assumption is that the jury will follow the statute, and, acting in accordance with the authority it confers, will accept as sufficient what the statute expressly so describes.' Id., at 237, 31 S.Ct., at 150.\n\n\n38\nEven if I could accept the doctrine that Congress after declaring that certain conduct shall be a crime has further power to tell judges and juries that certain evidence shall be sufficient to prove that conduct and convict a defendant, I could not agree that these statutory presumptions are constitutional. They declare mere presence at a still site without more to be sufficient evidence to convict of the crimes of carrying on a distillery business and possessing a still.5 While presence at a still is unquestionably a relevant circumstance to add to others to prove possession or operation of a still, I could not possibly agree that mere presence is sufficient in and of itself, without any supporting evidence, to permit a finding that, beyond a reasonable doubt, the person present carried on a distillery business or possessed a still or even aided and abetted in committing those crimes. Indeed, with respect to the crime of possession, as the Court concedes, we held squarely to the contrary in Bozza v. United States, 330 U.S. 160, 67 S.Ct. 645, 91 L.Ed. 818, quite properly, I think. In setting aside the Bozza conviction for possession of a still, which had been based on mere presence at a still, this Court was acting in accordance with the historic principle that 'independent trial judges and independent appellate judges have a most important place under our constitutional plan since they have power to set aside convictions.' United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U.S. 11, 19, 76 S.Ct. 1, 6. This judicial responsibility to pass on the sufficiency of the evidence must be exercised in each case, no more to be controlled by a general congressional enactment than it could be by a special act directed to one case only.6 This protective function of the court is amply demonstrated in the case before us: while Gainey was originally indicted on four counts, the trial judge directed a verdict of acquittal on one7 and the Court of Appeals ordered acquittal on another.8\n\n\n39\nIt indeed is true, as the Court suggests, that it was to make convictions possible on no more evidence than presence that the presumption statute here under consideration was passed. Undoubtedly a presumption which can be used to produce convictions without the necessity of proving a crucial element of the crime charged\u2014and a sometimes difficult-to-prove element at that9\u2014is a boon to prosecutors and an incongruous snare for defendants in a country that claims to require proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Quite accurately such a use of a presumption has been described as 'First Aid to the District Attorney.'10 Instead of supporting the constitutionality of such a use of statutory presumptions, however, I think this argument based on necessity and convenience points out its fatal defects. I suppose no one would deny that the Government's burden would also be made lighter if the defendant was not represented by counsel, compare Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, or if the jury could receive and consider confessions extorted by torture, compare Brown v. State of Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278, 56 S.Ct. 461, 80 L.Ed. 682, or if evidence obtained from defendants through illegal searches and seizures could be used against them, compare Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081, but this Court has not hesitated to strike down such encroachments on those constitutional rights. Yet here the Court sanctions a method less crude, but just as effective, to deny Gainey his constitutional right to a trial by jury.11\n\n\n40\nI cannot subscribe to the idea that any one of the constitutional grants of power to Congress enumerated in Art. I, \u00a7 8, including the Necessary and Proper Clause, contains either an express or an implied power of Congress to instruct juries as to what evidence is sufficient to convict defendants in particular cases.12 Congress can undoubtedly create crimes, but it cannot constitutionally try them. The Constitution specifically prohibits bills of attainder. Congress can declare certain conduct a crime, unless barred by some constitutional provision, but it must, if true to our Constitution of divided powers and the Fifth Amendment's command that cases be tried according to due process of law, leave the trial of those crimes to the courts, in which judges or juries can decide the facts on their own judgment without legislative constraint and judges can set aside conviction which they believe are not justified by the evidence. See Tot v. United States, 319 U.S. 463, 473, 63 S.Ct. 1241, 1247 (concurring opinion). '(I)t is not within the province of a legislature to declare an individual guilty or presumptively guilty of a crime.' McFarland v. American Sugar Refining Co., 241 U.S. 79, 86, 36 S.Ct. 498, 501, 60 L.Ed. 899. See Manley v. State of Georgia, 279 U.S. 1, 49 S.Ct. 215, 73 L.Ed. 575. Yet, viewed realistically, that is what the presumption which the Court today approves does in this case. I think that the presumption which should govern instead in criminal trials in the courts of this country is the time-honored presumption of innocence accorded to all criminal defendants until they are proved guilty by competent evidence.\n\n\n41\nNor can a power of Congress to detract from the constitutional power of juries and judges to decide what facts are enough to convict be implied because of the power of Congress to make procedural rules or rules of evidence. See Ex parte Fisk, 113 U.S. 713, 720, 5 S.Ct. 724, 727, 28 L.Ed. 1117. It is not disputed that Congress has power to prescribe rules governing admissibility of evidence and purely procedural matters. The Congress unquestionably could declare the fact of presence to be admissible evidence, for certainly it is relevant when considered along with other circumstances. Yet this power to say what shall or shall not be admissible in no way empowers Congress to determine what facts, once admitted, suffice to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.13 And I certainly cannot join the Court when it says:\n\n\n42\n'The process of making the determination of rationality is,      by its nature, highly empirical, and in matters not within      specialized judicial competence or completely commonplace,      significant weight should be accorded the capacity of      Congress to amass the stuff of actual experience and cull      conclusions from it.'\n\n\n43\nThe implication of this statement is that somehow Congress is better qualified to decide what facts are sufficient to convict defendants than are courts and juries. I accept the proposition that Congress is the proper branch of our Government to decide legislative policies and enact general laws and that in so doing it must of necessity deal with facts to some extent. This is as the Constitution provides. But Congress is not authorized nor has it any special 'expertise' with which I am familiar which entitles it to direct juries as to what conclusions they may or must draw from the unique facts of specific criminal cases tried in federal courts. Moreover, even were I to assume that Congress does have an expertise to assess facts in lawsuits which is superior to that of juries and judges, I still could not join the Court's opinion, for I think that the Founders of our Government decided for us that these are matters 'within specialized'\u2014and exclusive\u2014'judicial competence.' As this Court has said with reference to jury trial of facts:\n\n\n44\n'whether right or wrong, the premise underlying the      constitutional method for determining guilt or innocence in      federal courts is that laymen are better than specialists to      perform this task.' United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles,      350 U.S. 11, 18, 76 S.Ct. 1, 6.\n\n\n45\nBesides impairing Gainey's right to trial by jury according to due process safeguards, the statutes in this case I think violated Gainey's constitutional rights in still another way. These statutory presumptions must tend, when incorporated into an instruction, as they were here, to influence the jury to reach an inference which the trier of fact might not otherwise have though justified, to push some jurors to convict who might not otherwise have done so. Cf. Pollock v. Williams, 322 U.S. 4, 15, 64 S.Ct. 792, 798, 88 L.Ed. 1095. The undoubted practical effect of letting guilt rest on unexplained presence alone is to force a defendant to come forward and testify, however much he may think doing so may jeopardize his chances of acquittal, since if he does not he almost certainly destroys those chances. This is compulsion, which I think runs counter to the Fifth Amendment's purpose to forbid convictions on compelled testimony. The compulsion here is of course more subtle and less cruel physically than compulsion by torture, but it is nonetheless compulsion and it is nonetheless effective. I am aware that this Court in Yee Hem v. United States, 268 U.S. 178, 185, 45 S.Ct. 470, 472, 49 L.Ed. 904, held that use of a presumptive squeeze like this one did not amount to a form of compulsion forbidden by the Fifth Amendment. The Court's reasoning was contained in a single paragraph, the central argument of which was that despite a presumption like this a defendant is left 'entirely free to testify or not as he chooses.' That argument, it seems to me, would also justify admitting in evidence a confession extorted by a policeman's pointing a gun at the head of an accused, on the theory that the man being threatened was entirely free to confess or not, as he chose. I think the holding in Yee Hem is completely out of harmony with the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against compulsory self-incrimination, and I would overrule it. See Feldman v. United States, 322 U.S. 487, 494, 64 S.Ct. 1082, 1085, 88 L.Ed. 1408 (dissenting opinion); compare Leyra v. Denno, 347 U.S. 556, 74 S.Ct. 716, 98 L.Ed. 948. See also State v. Lapointe, 81 N.H. 227, 123 A. 692, 31 A.L.R. 1212, quoted with approval in the opinion of the court below, 322 F.2d 292, 296 (C.A.5th Cir.).\n\n\n46\nFor all the foregoing reasons, I think that these two statutory presumptions by which Congress has tried to relieve the Government of its burden of proving a man guilty and to take away from courts and juries the function and duty of deciding guilt or innocence according to the evidence before them, unconstitutionally encroach on the functions of courts and deny persons accused of crime rights which our Constitution guarantees them. The most important and most crucial action the courts take in trying people for crime is to resolve facts. This is a judicial, not a legislative, function. I think that in passing these two sections Congress stepped over its constitutionally limited bounds and encroached on the constitutional power of courts to try cases. I would therefore affirm the judgment of the court below and grant Gainey a new trial by judge and jury with all the protections accorded by the law of the land.\n\n\n\n1\n The evidence for the prosecution showed that an old Dodge truck with darkened headlights drove up to the site of a secluded still, hidden in a swamp in Dooly County, Georgia. The respondent, Jackie Gainey, left the truck, turned on a flashlight, and walked toward the still. There he was confronted by state and federal revenue agents. The respondent attempted to flee, but after a short chase, he and his waiting colleagues were apprehended. Since the trial, one of Gainey's co-defendants, Roy Lee Barrett, has died; the other, Cleveland Johns, elected to reserve and has completed his sentence.\n\n\n2\n Section 5601(b)(1) provides:\n'(1) Unregistered stills.\u2014\n'Whenever on trial for violation of subsection (a)(1) the defendant is shown to have been at the site or place where, and at the time when, a still or distilling apparatus was set up without having been registered, such presence of the defendant shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction, unless the defendant explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury (or of the court when tried without jury).'\nSection 5601(b)(2) provides:\n'(2) Failure or refusal of distiller or rectifier to give bond.\u2014\n'Whenever on trial for violation of subsection (a)(4) the defendant is shown to have been at the site or place where, and at the time when, the business of a distiller or rectifier was so engaged in or carried on, such presence of the defendant shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction, unless the defendant explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury (or of the court when tried without jury).'\nThese sections were introduced into the Code in 1958. The statutory inferences are modeled after 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 545 (1958 ed.), originally \u00a7 4 of the Smuggling Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 178, 179. Similar wording appears in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 (1958 ed.), the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act of 1909, 35 Stat. 614, the constitutionality of which was sustained in Yee Hem v. United States, 268 U.S. 178, 45 S.Ct. 470, 69 L.Ed. 904.\n\n\n3\n A third count charged a violation of \u00a7 5602, which prohibits carrying on the business of a distiller with intent to defraud the United States. The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction on this count also, and the Government did not seek review of this reversal. A fourth count, charging that the defendants, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5180 (1958 ed.), worked in a distillery on which no sign was placed showing the name of the person engaged in the distilling, resulted in a directed verdict of acquittal.\n\n\n4\n Hearings before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Ways and Means on Excise Tax Technical and Administrative Problems, Part 3, p. 95, 84th Cong., 2d Sess.\n\n\n5\n Bozza v. United States, 330 U.S. 160, 67 S.Ct. 645, 91 L.Ed. 818, contributed to congressional concern. See Hearings, note 4, supra. But that case did not deal with the problem of presence alone as insufficient evidence where the substantive offense is 'carrying on' the enterprise of illegal distillation. Bozza's conviction for 'carrying on' the enterprise of illegal distillation was affirmed by this Court.\n\n\n6\n 'Very few of the illicit distillers allow any one, except their most intimate friends, to approach their distilleries. Such places, as a rule, are forbidden ground, for the reason that when the violators are arrested it is a difficult matter to prove them guilty, when so few persons have ever seen them operating their distilleries.' Atkinson, After the Moonshiners, By One of the Raiders, at p. 23.\n'The first requisite for an illicit still is a good stream of cool water. * * *\n'The next requisite is seclusion. It must be placed where no one ever travels, or even thinks of traveling.' Id., at p. 18.\n\n\n7\n Indeed the better practice would be to instruct the jurors that they may draw the inference unless the evidence in the case provides a satisfactory explanation for the defendant's presence at the still, omitting any explicit reference to the statute itself in the charge.\n\n\n*\n 'In trial of all persons charged with the commission of offenses against the United States and in all proceedings in courts martial and courts of inquiry in any State, District, Possession or Territory, the person charged shall, at his own request, be a competent witness. His failure to make such request shall not create any presumption against him.'\n\n\n1\n 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5601(a)(1) (1958 ed.) provides:\n'Offenses.\n'Any person who\u2014\n'(1) Unregistered stills.\n'(H)as in his possession or custody, or under his control, any still or distilling apparatus set up which is not registered, as required by section 5179(a) * * *\n'shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, for each such offense.'\n\n\n2\n 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5601(a)(4) (1958 ed.) provides:\n'Offenses.\n'Any person who\u2014\n'(4) Failure or refusal of distiller or rectifier to give bond.\n'(C)arries on the business of a distiller or rectifier without having given bond as required by law * * *\n'shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, for each such offense.'\n\n\n3\n Section 5601(b)(1) provides:\n'(b) Presumptions.\n'(1) Unregistered stills.\u2014\n'Whenever on trial for violation of subsection (a)(1) the defendant is shown to have been at the site or place where, and at the time when, a still or distilling apparatus was set up without having been registered, such presence of the defendant shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction, unless the defendant explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury (or of the court when tried without jury).'\nSection 5601(b)(2) provides:\n'(2) Failure or refusal of distiller or rectifier to give bond.\u2014\n'Whenever on trial for violation of subsection (a)(4) the defendant is shown to have been at the site or place where, and at the time when, the business of a distiller or rectifier was so engaged in or carried on, such presence of the defendant shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction, unless the defendant explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury (or of the court when tried without jury).'\n\n\n4\n Although the Court does not consider the validity of \u00a7 5601(b)(1), its reasoning surely would seem to apply to that section as well.\n\n\n5\n I agree with the Court's holding that the language of \u00a7 5601(b)(2) 'permits the judge to submit a case to the jury on the basis of the accused's presence alone.' The Court does not suggest any reason why it would interpret the identical language in \u00a7 5601(b)(1) any differently.\n\n\n6\n Such an act obviously would be proscribed as a bill of attainder, forbidden by Art. I, \u00a7 9. See United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303, 66 S.Ct. 1073, 90 L.Ed. 1252; Cummings v. State of Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 11 L.Ed. 356; Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333, 18 L.Ed. 366.\n\n\n7\n The trial judge directed a verdict of acquittal on a count charging Gainey with working in a distillery which did not bear a sign showing the name of the person engaged in the distilling and denoting the business in which he was engaged, an offense made punishable by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5180(a), 5681(c) (1958 ed.).\n\n\n8\n Court three of the indictment charged Gainey with carrying on the business of a distiller with intent to defraud the United States of taxes, a violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5602 (1958 ed.). The Court of Appeals, holding that the record showed 'no evidence whatever of intent to defraud,' set aside the jury's verdict of conviction on that count. 322 F.2d 292, 300.\n\n\n9\n In this case, however, the record shows that there unquestionably was enough other evidence to submit the case to the jury without need for any artificial presumption. But the Court does not suggest that the use here of this presumption either should be or could be called harmless.\n\n\n10\n Chamberlain, Presumptions as First Aid to the District Attorney, 14 A.B.A.J. 287.\n\n\n11\n 'Once the thumbscrew and the following confession made conviction easy; but that method was crude and, I suppose, now would be declared unlawful upon some ground. Hereafter, presumption is to lighten the burden of the prosecutor. The victim will be spared the trouble of confessing and will go to his cell without mutilation or disquieting outcry.' Casey v. United States, 276 U.S. 413, 420, 48 S.Ct. 373, 375, 72 L.Ed. 632 (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n12\n It might be argued, although the Court does not so argue or hold, that Congress if it wished could make presence at a still a crime in itself, and so Congress should be free to create crimes which are called 'possession' and 'carrying on an illegal distillery business' but which are defined in such a way that unexplained presence is sufficient and indisputable evidence in all cases to support conviction for those offenses. See Ferry v. Ramsey, 277 U.S. 88, 48 S.Ct. 443, 72 L.Ed. 796. Assuming for the sake of argument that Congress could make unexplained presence a criminal act, and ignoring also the refusal of this Court in other cases to uphold a statutory presumption on such a theory, see Heiner v. Donnan, 285 U.S. 312, 52 S.Ct. 358, 76 L.Ed. 772, there is no indication here that Congress intended to adopt such a misleading method of draftsmanship, nor in my judgment could the statutory provisions if so construed escape condemnation for vagueness, under the principles applied in Lanzetta v. State of New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 59 S.Ct. 618, 83 L.Ed. 888, and many other cases.\n\n\n13\n 'While it is within the province of the legislature to determine the sources of evidence, the modes of verification, who may or may not be competent witnesses, I am not prepared to say they may weigh and determine the quantity of evidence, which shall suffice to produce conviction in the mind of the judge or juror who tries a cause.'

SHARPNACK.\nNo. 35.\nArgued Oct. 29, 1957.\nDecided Jan. 13, 1958.\n\nMiss Beatrice Rosenberg, Washington, D.C., for appellant.\nMr. Joel Westbrook, San Antonio, Tex., for appellee.\nMr. Justice BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe issue in this case is whether the Assimilative Crimes Act of 1948, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 13, is constitutional insofar as it makes applicable to a federal enclave a subsequently enacted criminal law of the State in which the enclave is situated. For the reasons hereafter stated, we hold that it is constitutional.\n\n\n2\nA four-count indictment, in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, charged the appellee, Sharpnack, with committing sex crimes involving two boys in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 13, and arts. 535b and 535c of Vernon's Texas Penal Code 1952. The offenses were charged to have been committed in 1955 at the Randolph Air Force Base, a federal enclave in Texas Articles 535b and 535c had been enacted in 1950 and, at the time of the commission of the alleged offenses, were in force throughout the State. Also, since 1948, the Federal Assimilative Crimes Act has provided that, within such an enclave, acts not punishable by any enactment of Congress are punishable by the then effective laws of the State in which the enclave is situated.1 Nevertheless, upon motion of Sharpnack, the District Court, in an unreported order, dismissed the indictment 'for the reason that Congress may not legislatively assimilate and adopt criminal statutes of a state which are enacted by the state subsequent to the enactment of the Federal Assimilative Statute.'2 The United States appealed to this Court under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3731, and we noted probable jurisdiction. 352 U.S. 962, 77 S.Ct. 356, 1 L.Ed.2d 319.\n\n\n3\nThe 1948 Assimilative Crimes Act was enacted as part of the Revised Criminal Code of the United States and reads as follows:\n\n\n4\n's 13. Laws of states adopted for areas within federal      jurisdiction.\n\n\n5\n'Whoever within or upon any of the places now existing or      hereafter reserved or acquired as provided in section 73 of this title, is guilty of any act or      omission which, although not made punishable by any enactment      of Congress, would be punishable if committed or omitted      within the jurisdiction of the State, Territory, Possession,      or District in which such place is situated, by the laws      thereof in force at the time of such act or omission, shall      be guilty of a like offense and subject to a like      punishment.' 18 U.S.C., 18 U.S.C.A.\n\n\n6\nIn the absence of restriction in the cessions of the respective enclaves to the United States, the power of Congress to exercise legislative jurisdiction over them is clearly stated in Article I, \u00a7 8, cl. 17, and Article IV, \u00a7 3, cl. 2, of the Constitution.4 See Collins v. Yosemite Park Co., 304 U.S. 518, 58 S.Ct. 1009, 82 L.Ed. 1502. The first Federal Crimes Act, enacted in 1790, 1 Stat. 112, defined a number of federal crimes and referred to federal enclaves. The need for dealing more extensively with criminal offenses in the enclaves was evident, and one natural solution was to adopt for each enclave the offenses made punishable by the State in which it was situated. See United States v. Press Publishing Co., 219 U.S. 1, 9 13, 31 S.Ct. 212, 213\u2014215, 55 L.Ed. 65. Initially there was room for a difference of opinion as to the desirability of doing this by blanket legislation, rather than by a code enumerating and defining specific offenses applicable to the enclaves. Congress made its initial decision on this point in 1825 by adopting for otherwise undefined offenses the policy of general conformity to local law. On repeated occasions thereafter Congress has confirmed that policy by enacting an unbroken series of Assimilative Crimes Acts. During the same period, Congress has recognized a slowly increasing number of federal crimes in the field of major offenses by enacting for the enclaves specific criminal statutes which have defined those crimes and, to that extent, have excluded the state laws from that field.5\n\n\n7\nIn the Act of 1825, sponsored by Daniel Webster in the House of Representatives, Congress expressly adopted the fundamental policy of conformity to local law.6 That Act provided the basis from which has grown the Assimilative Crimes Act now before us. Congress thereby made it clear that, with the exception of the enlarged list of offenses specifically proscribed by it, the federal offenses in each enclave were to be identical with those proscribed by the State in which the enclave was situated. That Act made no specific reference to subsequent repeals or amendments by the State of any assimilated laws. It also made no specific reference to new offenses that might be added by the State after the enactment of the Assimilative Crimes Act.\n\n\n8\nIn 1831, there was certified by a Circuit Court to this Court in United States v. Paul, 6 Pet. 141, 8 L.Ed. 348, the concrete question whether, under the Assimilative Crimes Act of 1825, a statute enacted in 1829 by the State of New York, defining a new offense to be known as burglary in the third degree, was applicable to the federal enclave at West Point. The question was submitted without argument and this Court's answer is reported in full as follows:\n\n\n9\n'Mr. Chief Justice Marshall stated it to be the opinion of      the Court, that the third section of the act of Congress, entitled 'an act more effectually to provide      for the punishment of certain crimes against the United      States, and for other purposes,' passed March 3, 1825, is to      be limited to the laws of the several states in force at the      time of its enactment. This was ordered to be certified to      the Circuit Court for the southern district of New York.'      Id., 6 Pet. at page 142.\n\n\n10\nThere is nothing in that answer or in the report of the case to show that the issue was decided as anything more than one of statutory construction falling within the doctrine calling for the narrow construction of a penal statute. So interpreted, the decision did not reach the issue that is before us. It did, however, carry a fair implication that the Act of 1825 was constitutional insofar as it made applicable to enclaves the criminal laws in force in the respective States at the time of the enactment of the Assimilative Crimes Act. This Court later so held in Franklin v. United States, 216 U.S. 559, 30 S.Ct. 434, 54 L.Ed. 615.\n\n\n11\nDue to the limitation of the Assimilative Crimes Act of 1825 to state laws in force at the time of its own enactment, the Act gradually lost much of its effectiveness in maintaining current conformity with state criminal laws. This result has been well called one of static conformity. To renew such conformity, Congress has enacted comparable Assimilative Crimes Acts in 1866, 14 Stat. 13; in 1874 as R.S. \u00a7 5391; in 1898, 30 Stat. 717; in 1909 as \u00a7 289 of the Criminal Code, 35 Stat. 1145; in 1933, 48 Stat. 152; in 1935, 49 Stat. 394; in 1940, 54 Stat. 234; and finally in 1948 in the Revised Criminal Code as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 13.\n\n\n12\nThe above series of substantial re-enactments demonstrates a consistent congressional purpose to apply the principle of conformity to state criminal laws in punishing most minor offenses committed within federal enclaves. In the re-enactments of 1866, 1874, 1898 and 1909, the interpretation given the Act of 1825 by the Paul case was made explicit by expressly limiting the assimilation to the state laws 'now in force,' or as the 'laws of the State * * * now provide. * * *' In the Acts of 1933, 1935 and 1940, Congress continued to prescribe assimilation to the state laws 'in force' on specified recent dates, and these three re-enactments also made the assimilation conditional upon the state laws 'remaining in force at the time of the doing or omitting the doing of such act or thing. * * *'7 This helped to keep the federal law current with the state law by reflecting future deletions from the state laws as soon as made.\n\n\n13\nIn 1948 coincidentally with its revision of the Criminal Code of the United States, Congress finally adopted the present language. This expressly limits the assimilation to acts or omissions committed within a federal enclave and \"not made punishable by any enactment of Congress * * *.' It further specifies that 'Whoever * * * is guilty of any act or omission which * * * would be punishable if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the State * * * in which such place is situated, by the laws thereof in force at the time of such act or omission, shall be guilty of a like (federal) offense and subject to a like punishment.' (Emphasis supplied.) This assimilation applies whether the state laws are enacted before or after the Federal Assimilative Crimes Act and at once reflects every addition, repeal or amendment of a state law.8 Recognizing its underlying policy of 123 years' standing, Congress has thus at last provided that within each federal enclave, to the extent that offenses are not preempted by congressional enactments, there shall be comlete current conformity with the criminal laws of the respective States in which the enclaves are situated.\n\n\n14\nThere is no doubt that Congress may validly adopt a criminal code for each federal enclave. It certainly may do so by drafting new laws or by copying laws dufining the criminal offenses in force throughout the State in which the enclave is situated. As a practical matter, it has to proceed largely on a wholesale basis. Its reason for adopting local laws is not so much because Congress has examined them individually as it is because the laws are already in force throughout the State in which the enclave is situated.9 The basic legislative decision made by Congress is its decision to conform the laws in the enclaves to the local laws as to all offenses not punishable by any enactment of Congress. Whether Congress sets forth the assimilated laws in full or assimilates them by reference, the result is as definite and as ascertainable as are the state laws themselves.\n\n\n15\nHaving the power to assimilate the state laws, Congress obviously has like power to renew such assimilation annually or daily in order to keep the laws in the enclaves current with those in the States. That being so, we conclude that Congress is within its constitutional powers and legislative discretion when, after 123 years of experience with the policy of conformity, it enacts that policy in its most complete and accurate form. Rather than being a delegation by Congress of its legislative authority to the States, it is a deliberate continuing adoption by Congress for federal enclaves of such unpre-empted offenses and punishments as shall have been already put in effect by the respective States for their own government. Congress retains power to exclude a particular state law from the assimilative effect of the Act. This procedure is a practical accommodation of the mechanics of the legislative functions of State and Nation in the field of police power where it is especially appropriate to make the federal regulation of local conduct conform to that already established by the State.

Sadrakula, 309 U.S. 94, 100\u2014101, 60 S.Ct. 431, 434\u2014435, 84 L.Ed. 596.\n\n\n16\nExamples of uses made by Congress of future state legislative action in connection with the exercise of federal legislative power are numerous. The Webb-Kenyon Act of March 1, 1913, 37 Stat. 699, 700, 27 U.S.C. \u00a7 122, 27 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 122, prohibited the shipment of intoxicating liquors into a State to be used 'in violation of any law of such State * * *.' West Virginia subsequently enacted a prohibition law. This Court nevertheless upheld the applicability of the Federal Act as it assimilated that subsequent state statute. Clark Distilling Co. v.

Toombs, 18 Wall. 648, 655, 21 L.Ed. 966.12\n\n\n24\nThe application of the Assimilative Crimes Act to subsequently adopted state legislation, under the limitations here prescribed, is a reasonable exercise of congressional legislative power and discretion.13 Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded to it for further action consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n25\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n26\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK concurs, dissenting.\n\n\n27\nThere are two provisions of the Constitution involved in the present controversy. Article I, \u00a7 1 provides: 'All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.' A supplementary provision is that contained in Art. IV, \u00a7 3, cl. 2: 'The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States * * *.'\n\n\n28\nIt is, therefore, the Congress, and the Congress alone, that has the power to make rules governing federal enclaves. I suppose there would be no doubt, at least after Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 72 S.Ct. 863, 96 L.Ed. 1153, that this rule-making power could not be exercised by the President, let alone some federal agency such as the Department of the Interior. The power to make laws under which men are punished for crimes calls for as serious a deliberation as the fashioning of rules for the seizure of the industrial plants involved in the Youngstown case. Both call for the exercise of legislative judgment; and I do not see how that requirement can be satisfied by delegating the authority to the President, the Department of the Interior, or, as in this case, to the States. The Court held in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 55 S.Ct. 837, 79 L.Ed. 1570, that the determination of what constitutes 'fair competition' may not be left with the industry affected, subject to approval by the President. For the codes promulgated would have the standing of federal statutes. 'But Congress cannot delegate legislative power to the President to exercise an unfettered discretion to make whatever laws he thinks may be needed or advisable for the rehabilitation and expansion of trade or industry.' Id., 295 U.S. at pages 537\u2014538, 55 S.Ct. at page 846. The codemaking authority was held to be an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. Id., 295 U.S. at page 542, 55 S.Ct. at page 843. 'The Congress is not permitted to abdicate or to transfer to others the essential legislative functions with which it is * * * vested.' Id., 295 U.S. at page 529, 55 S.Ct. at page 843.\n\n\n29\nThe vice in the Schechter case was not that the President was the one who received the delegated authority, but that the Congress had abdicated the lawmaking function. The result should be the same whether the lawmaking authority, constituted by Congress, is the President or a State.\n\n\n30\nOf course Congress can adopt as federal laws the laws of a State; and it has often done so. Even when it does so without any enumeration of the laws, it 'has acted as definitely as if it had repeated the words' used by the State, as Mr. Justice Holmes said in Knicker-bocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, 253 U.S. 149, 167, 40 S.Ct. 438, 443, 64 L.Ed. 834. Also Congress could, I think, adopt as federal law, governing an enclave, the state law governing speeding as it may from time to time be enacted. The Congress there determines what the basic policy is. Leaving the details to be filled in by a State is analogous to the scheme of delegated implementation of congressionally adopted policies with which we are familiar in the field of administrative law. But it is Congress that must determine the policy, for that is the essence of lawmaking. Under the scheme now approved a State makes such federal law, applicable to the enclave, as it likes, and that law becomes federal law, for the violation of which the citizen is sent to prison.\n\n\n31\nHere it is a sex crime on which Congress has never legislated. Tomorrow it may be a blue law, a law governing usury, or even a law requiring segregation of the reces on buses and in restaurants. It may be a law that could never command a majority in the Congress or that in no sense reflected its will. It is no answer to say that the citizen would have a defense under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to unconstitutional applications of these federal laws or the procedures under them. He is entitled to the considered judgment of Congress whether the law applied to him fits the federal policy. That is what federal lawmaking is. It is that policy which has led the Court heretofore to limit these Assimilative Crimes Acts to those state laws in force at the time of enactment of the Federal Act. United States v. Paul, 6 Pet. 141, 8 L.Ed. 348. And see Franklin v. United States, 216 U.S. 559, 568\u2014569, 30 S.Ct. 434, 436\u2014437, 54 L.Ed. 615.\n\n\n32\nThere is some convenience in doing what the Court allows today. Congress is saved the bother of enacting new Assimilative Crimes Acts from time to time. Federal laws grow like mushrooms without Congress passing a bill. But convenience is not material to the constitutional problem. With all due deference to those who are convinced the other way, I am forced to conclude that under this Assimilative Crimes Act it is a State, not the Congress, that is exercising the legislative power under Art. I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution and that is making the 'needful Rules and Regulations' envisioned by Art. IV, \u00a7 3, cl. 2. That may not constitutionally be done.\n\n\n\n1\n There is no contention that the acts here charged were punishable under any enactment of Congress other than by virtue of the Assimilative Crimes Act, and there is no contention that Randolph Air Force Base is not a federal enclave subject to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 13.\n\n\n2\n The order also included the following paragraph:\n'It is further the opinion of this Court that Section 13, Title 18, United States Code, enacted in 1948, wherein it assimilates and adopts said criminal statutes enacted by the state subsequent to the enactment of said section, to-wit: Articles 535(b) and 535(c) of the Texas Penal Statutes, enacted in 1950, upon which all four counts of this indictment are predicated, is a delegation of Congress' legislative authority to the states in violation of the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n\n3\n Section 7 contains the following provision:\n'The term 'special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States,' as used in this title, includes:\n'(3) Any lands reserved or acquired for the use of the United States, and under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof, or any place purchased or otherwise acquired by the United States by consent of the legislature of the State in which the same shall be, for the erection of a fort, magazine, arsenal, dockyard, or other needful building.' 18 U.S.C., 18 U.S.C.A.\n\n\n4\n\n'Article. I.\n'Section 8. The Congress shall have Power * * *\n'To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of Particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings * * *.\n'Article. IV.\n'Section. 3. * * *\n'The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State.' U.S.Const.\n\n\n5\n For example, the following offenses committed within federal enclaves are now made criminal by such enactments of Congress: arson, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 81, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 81; assault, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 113; maiming, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 114, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 114; larceny, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 661, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 661; receiving stolen property, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 662, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 662; false pretenses 'upon any waters or vessel within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States,' 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1025, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1025; murder, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1111; manslaughter, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1112; attempted murder or manslaughter, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1113; malicious mischief, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1363, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1363; rape, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2031, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2031; carnal knowledge, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2032, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2032; and robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2111.\n\n\n6\n 'Sec. 3. * * * if any offence shall be committed in any of the places aforesaid, the punishment of which offence is not specially provided for by any law of the United States, such offence shall, upon a conviction in any court of the United States having recognisance thereof, be liable to, and receive the same punishment as the laws of the state in which such fort, dock-yard, navy-yard, arsenal, armory, or magazine, or other place, ceded as aforesaid, is situated, provide for the like offence when committed within the body of any county of such state.' 4 Stat. 115.\n\n\n7\n See H.R.Rep.

No. 1022, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.\n\n\n8\n The Reviser's Note to \u00a7 13 states the situation simply:\n'The revised section omits the specification of any date as unnecessary in a revision, which speaks from the date of its enactment. Such omission will not only make effective within Federal reservations, the local State laws in force on the date of the enactment of the revision, but will authorize the Federal courts to apply the same measuring stick to such offenses as is applied in the adjoining State under future changes of the State law and will make unnecessary periodic pro forma amendments of this section to keep abreast of changes of local laws. In other words, the revised section makes applicable to offenses committed on such reservations, the law of the place that would govern if the reservation had not been ceded to the United States.' 18 U.S.C., 18 U.S.C.A.\n\n\n9\n We do not now pass upon the effect of the Assimilative Crimes Act where an assimilated state law conflicts with a specific federal criminal statute, cf. Williams v. United States, 327 U.S. 711, 66 S.Ct. 778, 90 L.Ed. 962, or with a federal policy. Cf. Johnson v. Yellow Cab Transit Co., 321 U.S. 383, 64 S.Ct. 622, 88 L.Ed. 814; Stewart & Co. v. Sadrakula, 309 U.S. 94, 60 S.Ct. 431, 84 L.Ed. 596; Hunt v. United States, 278 U.S. 96, 49 S.Ct. 38, 73 L.Ed. 200; Air Terminal Services, Inc., v. Rentzel, D.C., 81 F.Supp. 611; Oklahoma City v. Sanders, 10 Cir., 94 F.2d 323, 115 A.L.R. 363.\n\n\n10\n In Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, supra, this Court voided a statute which attempted to make state workmen's compensation laws applicable to injuries within the federal admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. The basis of that holding, which we do not now re-examine, was that 'the Constitution not only contemplated, but actually established' a 'harmony and uniformity' of law throughout the admiralty jurisdiction. Id., 253 U.S. at page 164, 40 S.Ct. at page 441. That statute was voided because it was designed to 'destroy' what was considered to be a constitutionally required uniformity. Ibid. In contrast, the statute now before us is designed to effectuate a long-standing congressional policy of conformity with local law.\n\n\n11\n The applicability of criminal provisions under the Connally Hot Oil Act, 49 Stat. 30, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 715, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 715, depends upon the adoption of state conservation laws. See Humble Oil & Refining Co. v. United States, 10 Cir., 198 F.2d 753.\nUnder the Fugitive from Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1073, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1073, it is criminal for a person to travel in interstate commerce to avoid prosecution for specified crimes as defined 'under the laws of the place from which he flees * * *.' Cf. Hemans v. United States, 6 Cir., 163 F.2d 228.\n\n\n12\n Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 47\u201450, 6 L.Ed. 253, is not controlling. In that case, Chief Justice Marshall stated that Congress could not constitutionally delegate to state legislatures the power to adopt future 'rules of practice' and 'modes of proceeding' which would bind federal courts. In 1872, that decision was met by Congress in the adoption of the Conformity Act, 17 Stat. 197, which prescribed:\n'Sec. 5. That the practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding in other than equity and admiralty causes in the circuit and district courts of the United States shall conform, as near as may be, to the practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding existing at the time in like causes in the courts of record of the State within which such circuit or district courts are held, any rule of court to the contrary notwithstanding * * *.' (Emphasis supplied.) While this Act was later restricted by interpretation, the validity of its application to future state practice was generally accepted by the courts.

A rule to show cause was issued, but was dismissed on motion of the appellee, on the ground that he was entitled to immunity under \u00a7 202(g) of the Emergency Price Control Act, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 922(g), from prosecution for the transactions upon which the petition was founded.

The main issue is the same as that presented in the companion case, Shapiro v. United States, 335 U.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 1375, but two additional minor questions are raised:\n\n\n3\n1. Appellee urges that the appeal was not properly taken by the United States because the Government was not a party to the proceedings in the District Court. The record shows, however, that the litigation was instituted in that court by a petition of the OPA District Enforcement Attorney on behalf of the Price Administrator. When the rule to show cause was issued, the court appointed the United States Attorney and the OPA District Enforcement Attorney as 'attorneys to prosecute the criminal charges contained in the petition filed herein on behalf of the Court and of the United States.' See Rule 42(b) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A. following section 687, 327 U.S. 865, 866. Thus the United States was, in any relevant sense, a party to the proceedings, and the appeal was properly brought under the Criminal Appeals Act. See United States v. Goldman, 1928, 277 U.S. 229, 235, 48 S.Ct. 486, 487, 72 L.Ed. 862; Ex parte Grossman, 1925, 267 U.S. 87, 115 et seq., 45 S.Ct. 332, 335, 69 L.Ed. 527, 38 A.L.R. 131.\n\n\n4\n2.

The petition sought the release of Gerald Francis Gault, appellants' 15-year-old son, who had been committed as a juvenile delinquent to the State Industrial School by the Juvenile Court of Gila County, Arizona. The Supreme Court of Arizona affirmed dismissal of the writ against various arguments which included an attack upon the constitutionality of the Arizona Juvenile Code because of its alleged denial of procedural due process rights to juveniles charged with being 'delinquents.' The court agreed that the constitutional guarantee of due process of law is applicable in such proceedings. It held that Arizona's Juvenile Code is to be read as 'impliedly' implementing the 'due process concept.' It then proceeded to identify and describe 'the particular elements which constitute due process in a juvenile hearing.' It concluded that the proceedings ending in commitment of Gerald Gault did not offend those requirements. We do not agree, and we reverse. We begin with a statement of the facts.\n\nI.\n\n2\nOn Monday, June 8, 1964, at about 10 a.m., Gerald Francis Gault and a friend, Ronald Lewis, were taken into custody by the Sheriff of Gila County. Gerald was then still subject to a six months' probation order which had been entered on February 25, 1964, as a result of his having been in the company of another boy who had stolen a wallet from a lady's purse. The police action on June 8 was taken as the result of a verbal complaint by a neighbor of the boys, Mrs. Cook, about a telephone call made to her in which the caller or callers made lewd or indecent remarks. It will suffice for purposes of this opinion to say that the remarks or questions put to her were of the irritatingly offensive, adolescent, sex variety.\n\n\n3\nAt the time Gerald was picked up, his mother and father were both at work. No notice that Gerald was being taken into custody was left at the home. No other steps were taken to advise them that their son had, in effect, been arrested. Gerald was taken to the Children's Detention Home. When his mother arrived home at about 6 o'clock, Gerald was not there. Gerald's older brother was sent to look for him at the trailer home of the Lewis family. He apparently learned then that Gerald was in custody. He so informed his mother. The two of them went to the Detention Home. The deputy probation officer, Flagg, who was also superintendent of the Detention Home, told Mrs. Gault 'why Jerry was there' and said that a hearing would be held in Juvenile Court at 3 o'clock the following day, June 9.\n\n\n4\nOfficer Flagg filed a petition with the court on the hearing day, June 9, 1964. It was not served on the Gaults. Indeed, none of them saw this petition until the habeas corpus hearing on August 17, 1964. The petition was entirely formal. It made no reference to any factual basis for the judicial action which it initiated. It recited only that 'said minor is under the age of eighteen years, and is in need of the protection of this Honorable Court; (and that) said minor is a delinquent minor.' It prayed for a hearing and an order regarding 'the care and custody of said minor.' Officer Flagg executed a formal affidavit in support of the petition.\n\n\n5\nOn June 9, Gerald, his mother, his older brother, and Probation Officers Flagg and Henderson appeared before the Juvenile Judge in chambers. Gerald's father was not there. He was at work out of the city. Mrs. Cook, the complainant, was not there. No one was sworn at this hearing. No transcript or recording was made. No memorandum or record of the substance of the proceedings was prepared. Our information about the proceedings and the subsequent hearing on June 15, derives entirel f rom the testimony of the Juvenile Court Judge,1 Mr. and Mrs. Gault and Officer Flagg at the habeas corpus proceeding conducted two months later. From this, it appears that at the June 9 hearing Gerald was questioned by the judge about the telephone call. There was conflict as to what he said. His mother recalled that Gerald said he only dialed Mrs. Cook's number and handed the telephone to his friend, Ronald. Officer Flagg recalled that Gerald had admitted making the lewd remarks. Judge McGhee testified that Gerald 'admitted making one of these (lewd) statements.' At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge said he would 'think about it.' Gerald was taken back to the Detention Home. He was not sent to his own home with his parents. On June 11 or 12, after having been detained since June 8, Gerald was released and driven home.2 There is no explanation in the record as to why he was kept in the Detention Home or why he was released. At 5 p.m. on the day of Gerald's release, Mrs. Gault received a note signed by Officer Flagg. It was on plain paper, not letterhead. Its entire text was as follows:\n\n\n6\n'Mrs. Gault:\n\n\n7\n'Judge McGHEE has set Monday June 15, 1964 at 11:00 A.M. as      the date and time for further Hearings on Gerald's      delinquency\n\n\n8\n'\/s\/ Flagg' At the appointed time on Monday, June 15, Gerald, his father and mother, Ronald Lewis and his father, and Officers Flagg and Henderson were present before Judge McGhee. Witnesses at the habeas corpus proceeding differed in their recollections of Gerald's testimony at the June 15 hearing. Mr. and Mrs. Gault recalled that Gerald again testified that he had only dialed the number and that the other boy had made the remarks. Officer Flagg agreed that at this hearing Gerald did not admit making the lewd remarks.3 But Judge McGhee recalled that 'there was some admission again of some of the lewd statements. He\u2014he didn't admit any of the more serious lewd statements.'4 Again, the complainant, Mrs. Cook, was not present. Mrs. Gault asked that Mrs. Cook be present 'so she could see which boy that done the talking, the dirty talking over the phone.' The Juvenile Judge said 'she didn't have to be present at that hearing.' The judge did not speak to Mrs. Cook or communicate with her at any time. Probation Officer Flagg had talked to her once\u2014over the telephone on June 9.\n\n\n9\nAt this June 15 hearing a 'referral report' made by the probation officers was filed with the court, although not disclosed to Gerald or his parents. This listed the charge as 'Lewd Phone Calls.' At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge committed Gerald as a juvenile delinquent to the State Industrial School 'for the period of his minority (that is, until 21), unless sooner discharged by due process of law.' An order to that effect was entered. It recites that 'after a full hearing and due deliberation the Court finds that said minor is a delinquent child, and that said minor is of the age of 15 years.'\n\n\n10\nNo appal  is permitted by Arizona law in juvenile cases. On August 3, 1964, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus was filed with the Supreme Court of Arizona and referred by it to the Superior Court for hearing.\n\n\n11\nAt the habeas corpus hearing on August 17, Judge McGhee was vigorously cross-examined as to the basis for his actions. He testified that he had taken into account the fact that Gerald was on probation. He was asked 'under what section of * * * the code you found the boy delinquent?'\n\n\n12\nHis answer is set forth in the margin.5 In substance, he concluded that Gerald came within ARS \u00a7 8\u2014201, subsec. 6(a), which specifies that a 'delinquent child' includes one 'who has violated a law of the state or an ordinance or regulation of a political subdivision thereof.' The law which Gerald was found to have violated is ARS \u00a7 13\u2014377. This section of the Arizona Criminal Code provides that a person who 'in the presence or hearing of any woman or child * * * uses vulgar, abusive or obscene language, is guilty of a misdemeanor * * *.' The penalty specified in the Criminal Code, which would apply to an adult, is $5 to $50, or imprisonment for not more than two months. The judge also testified that he acted under ARS \u00a7 8 201, subsec. 6(d) which includes in the definition of a 'delinquent child' one who, as the judge phrased it, is 'habitually involved in immoral matters.'6\n\n\n13\nAsked about the basis for his conclusion that Gerald was 'habitually involved in immoral matters,' the judge testified, somewhat vaguely, that two years earlier, on July 2, 1962, a 'referral' was made concerning Gerald, 'where the boy had stolen a baseball glove from another boy and lied to the Police Department about it.' The judge said there was 'no hearing,' and 'no accusation' relating to this incident, 'because of lack of material foundation.' But it seems to have remained in his mind as a relevant factor. The judge also testified that Gerald had admitted making other nuisance phone calls in the past which, as the judge recalled the boy's testimony, were 'silly calls, or funny calls, or something like that.'\n\n\n14\nThe Superior Court dismissed the writ, and appellants sought review in the Arizona Supreme Court. That court stated that it considered appellants' assignments of error as urging (1) that the Juvenile Code, ARS \u00a7 8\u2014201 to \u00a7 8\u2014239, is unconstitutional because it does not require that parents and children be apprised of the specific charges, does not require proper notice of a hearing, and does not provide for an appeal; and (2) that the proceedings and order relating to Gerald constituted a denial of due process of law because of the absence of adequate notice of the charge and the hearing; failure to notify appellants of certain constitutional rights including th r ights to counsel and to confrontation, and the privilege against self-incrimination; the use of unsworn hearsay testimony; and the failure to make a record of the proceedings. Appellants further asserted that it was error for the Juvenile Court to remove Gerald from the custody of his parents without a showing and finding of their unsuitability, and alleged a miscellany of other errors under state law.\n\n\n15\nThe Supreme Court handed down an elaborate and wide-ranging opinion affirming dismissal of the writ and stating the court's conclusions as to the issues raised by appellants and other aspects of the juvenile process. In their jurisdictional statement and brief in this Court, appellants do not urge upon us all of the points passed upon by the Supreme Court of Arizona. They urge that we hold the Juvenile Code of Arizona invalid on its face or as applied in this case because, contrary to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the juvenile is taken from the custody of his parents and committed to a state institution pursuant to proceedings in which the Juvenile Court has virtually unlimited discretion, and in which the following basic rights are denied:\n\n\n16\n1. Notice of the charges;\n\n\n17\n2. Right to counsel;\n\n\n18\n3. Right to confrontation and cross-examination;\n\n\n19\n4. Privilege against self-incrimination;\n\n\n20\n5. Right to a transcript of the proceedings; and\n\n\n21\n6. Right to appellate review.\n\n\n22\nWe shall not consider other issues which were passed upon by the Supreme Court of Arizona. We emphasize that we indicate no opinion as to whether the decision of that court with respect to such other issues does or does not conflict with requirements of the Federal Constitution.7\n\nII.\n\n23\nThe Supreme Court of Arizona held that due process of law is requisite to the constitutional validity of proceedings in which a court reaches the conclusion that a juvenile has been at fault, has engaged in conduct prohibited by law, or has otherwise misbehaved with the consequence that he is committed to an institution in which his freedom is curtailed. This conclusion is in accord with the decisions of a number of courts under both federal and state constitutions.8\n\n\n24\nThis Court has not heretofore decided the precise question. In Kent v. United States, 383 U.S. 541, 86 S.Ct. 1045, 16 L.Ed.2d 84 (1966), we considered the requirements for a valid waiver of the 'exclusive' jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court of the District of Columbia so that a juvenile could be tried in the adult criminal court of the District. Although our decision turned upon the language of the statute, we emphasized the necessity that 'the basic requirements of due process and fairness' he satisfied in such proceedings.9 Haley v. State of Ohio, 332 U.S. 596, 68 S.Ct. 302, 92 L.Ed. 224 (1948), involved the admissibility, in a state criminal court of general jurisdiction, of a confession by a 15-year-old boy. The Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment applied to prohibit the use of the coerced confession. Mr. Justice Douglas said, 'Neither man nor child can be allowed to stand condemned by methods which flout constitutional requirements of due process of law.'10 To the same effect is Gallegos v. State of Colorado, 370 U.S. 49, 82 S.Ct. 1209, 8 L.Ed.2d 325 (1962). Accordingly, while these cases relate only to restricted aspects of the subject, they unmistakably indicate that, whatever may be their precise impact, neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor the Bill of Rights is for adults alone.\n\n\n25\nWe do not in this opinion consider the impact of these constitutional provisions upon the totality of the relationship of the juvenile and the state. We do not even consider the entire process relating to juvenile 'delinquents.' For example, we are not here concerned with the procedures or constitutional rights applicable to the pre-judicial stages of the juvenile process, nor do we direct our attention to the post-adjudicative or dispositional process. See note 48, infra. We consider only the problems presented to us by this case. These relate to the proceedings by which a determination is made as to whether a juvenile is a 'delinquent' as a result of alleged misconduct on his part, with the consequence that he may be committed to a state institution. As to these proceedings, there appears to be little current dissent from the proposition that the Due Process Clause has a role to play.11 The problem is to ascertain the precise impact of the due process requirement upon such proceedings.\n\n\n26\nFrom the inception of the juvenile court system, wide differences have been tolerated\u2014indeed insisted upon\u2014between the procedural rights accorded to adults and those of juveniles. In practically all jurisdictions, there are rights granted to adults which are withheld from juveniles. In addition to the specific problems involved in the present case, for example, it has been held that the juvenile is not entitled to bail, to indictment by grand jury, to a public trial or to trial by jury.12 It is frequent practice that rules governing the arrest and interrogation of adults by the police are not observed in the case of juveniles.13\n\n\n27\nThe history and theory underlying this development are well-known, but a recapitulation is necessary for purposes of this opinion. The Juvenile Court movement began in this country at the end of the last century. From the juvenile court statute adopted in Illinois in 1899, the system has spread to every State in the Union, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.14 The constitutionality of juvenile court laws has been sustained in over 40 jurisdictions against a variety of attacks.15\n\n\n28\nThe early reformers were appalled by adult procedures and penalties, and by the fact that children could be given long prison sentences and mixed in jails with hardened criminals. They were profoundly convinced that society's duty to the child could not be confined by the concept of justice alone. They believed that society's role was not to ascertain whether the child was 'guilty' or 'innocent,' but 'What is he, how has he become what he is, and what had best be done in his interest and in the interest of the state to save him from a downward career.'16 The child essentially good, as they saw it\u2014was to be made 'to feel that he is the object of (the state's) care and solicitude,'17 not that he was under arrest or on trial. The rules of criminal procedure were therefore altogether inapplicable. The apparent rigidities, ec hnicalities, and harshness which they observed in both substantive and procedural criminal law were therefore to be discarded. The idea of crime and punishment was to be abandoned. The child was to be 'treated' and 'rehabilitated' and the procedures, from apprehension through institutionalization, were to be 'clinical' rather than punitive.\n\n\n29\nThese results were to be achieved, without coming to conceptual and constitutional grief, by insisting that the proceedings were not adversary, but that the state was proceeding as parens patriae.18 The Latin phrase proved to be a great help to those who sought to rationalize the exclusion of juveniles from the constitutional scheme; but its meaning is murky and its historic credentials are of dubious relevance. The phrase was taken from chancery practice, where, however, it was used to describe the power of the state to act in loco parentis for the purpose of protecting the property interests and the person of the child.19 But there is no trace of the doctrine in the history of criminal jurisprudence. At common law, children under seven were considered incapable of possessing criminal intent. Beyond that age, they were subjected to arrest, trial, and in theory to punishment like adult offenders.20 In these old days, the state was not deemed to have authority to accord them fewer procedural rights than adults.\n\n\n30\nThe right of the state, as parens patriae, to deny to the child procedural rights available to his elders was elaborated by the assertion that a child, unlike an adult, has a right 'not to liberty but to custody.' He can be made to attorn to his parents, to go to school, etc. If his parents default in effectively performing their custodial functions\u2014that is, if the child is 'delinquent'\u2014the state may intervene. In doing so, it does not deprive the child of any rights, because he has none. It merely provides the 'custody' to which the child is entitled.21 On this basis, proceedings involving juveniles were described as 'civil' not 'criminal' and therefore not subject to the requirements which restrict the state when it seeks to deprive a person of his liberty.22\n\n\n31\nAccordingly, the highest motives and most enlightened impulses led to a peculiar system for juveniles, unknown to our law in any comparable context. The constitutional and theoretical basis for this peculiar system is\u2014to say the least\u2014debatable. And in practice, as we remarked in the Kent case, supra, the results have not been entirely satisfactory.23 Juvenile Court history has again demonstrated that unbridled discretion, however benevolently motivated, is frequently a poor substitute for principle and procedure. In 1937, Dean Pound wrote: 'The powers of the Star Chamber were a trifle in comparison with those of our juvenile courts * * *.'24 The absence of substantive standards has not necessarily meant that children receive careful, compassionate, individualized treatment. The absence of procedural rules based upon constitutional principle has not always produced fair, efficient, and effective procedures. Departures from established principles of due process have frequently resulted not in enlightened procedure, but in arbitrariness. The Chairman of the Pennsylvania Council of Juvenile Court Judges has recently observed: 'Unfortunately, loose procedures, high-handed methods and crowded court calendars, either singly or in combination, all too often, have resulted in depriving some juveniles of fundamental rights that have resulted in a denial of due process.'25\n\n\n32\nFailure to observe the fundamental requirements of due process has resulted in instances, which might have been avoided, of unfairness to individuals and inadequate or inaccurate findings of fact and unfortunate prescriptions of remedy. Due process of law is the primary and indispensable foundation of individual freedom. It is the basic and essential term in the social compact which defines the rights of the individual and delimits the powers which the state may exercise.26 As Mr. Justice Frankfurter has said: 'The history of American freedom is, in no small measure, the history of procedure.'27 But, in addition, the procedural rules which have been fashioned from the generality of due process are our best instruments for the distillation and evaluation of essential facts from the conflicting welter of data that life and our adversary methods present. It is these instruments of due process which enhance the possibility that truth will emerge from the confrontation of opposing versions and conflicting data. 'Procedure is to law what 'scientific method' is to science.'28\n\n\n33\nIt is claimed that juveniles obtain benefits from the special procedures applicable to them which more than offset the disadvantages of denial of the substance of normal due process. As we shall discuss, the observance of due process standards, intelligently and not ruthlessly administered, will not compel the States to abandon or displace any of the substantive benefits of the juvenile process.29 But it is important, we think, that the claimed benefits of the juvenile process should be candidly appraised. Neither sentiment nor folklore should cause us to shut our eyes, for example, to such startling findings as that reported in an exceptionally reliable study of repeaters or recidivism conducted by the Standford Research Institute for the President's Commission on Crime in the District of Columbia. This Commission's Report states:\n\n\n34\n'In fiscal 1966 approximately 66 percent of the 16- and      17-year-old juveniles referred to the court by the Youth Aid      Division had been before the court previously. In 1965, 56      percent of those in the Receiving Home were repeaters. The      SRI study revealed that 61 percent of the sample Juvenile      Court referrals in 1965 had been previously referred at least      once and that 42 percent had been referred at least twice      before.' Id., at 773.\n\n\n35\nCertainly, these figures and the high crime rates among juveniles to which we have referred (supra, n. 26), could not lead us to conclude that the absence of constitutional protections reduces crime, or that the juvenile system, functioning free of constitutional inhibitions as it has largely done, is effective to reduce crime or rehabilitate offenders. We do not mean by this to denigrate the juvenile court process or to suggest that there are not aspects of the juvenile system relating to offenders which are valuable. But the features of the juvenile system which its proponents have asserted are of unique benefit will not be impaired by constitutional domestication. For example, the commendable principles relating to the processing and treatment of juveniles separately from adults are in no way involved or affected by the procedural issues under discussion.30 Further, we are told that one of the important benefits of the special juvenile court procedures is that they avoid classifying the juvenile as a 'criminal.' The juvenile offender is now classed as a 'delinquent.' There is, of course, no reason why this should not continue. It is disconcerting, however, that this term has come to involve only slightly less stigma than the term 'criminal' applied to adults.31 It is also emphasized that in practically all jurisdictions, statutes provide that an adjudication of the child as a delinquent shall not operate as a civil disbi lity or disqualify him for civil service appointment.32 There is no reason why the application of due process requirements should interfere with such provisions.\n\n\n36\nBeyond this, it is frequently said that juveniles are protected by the process from disclosure of their deviational behavior. As the Supreme Court of Arizona phrased it in the present case, the summary procedures of Juvenile Courts are sometimes defended by a statement that it is the law's policy 'to hide youthful errors from the full gaze of the public and bury them in the graveyard of the forgotten past.' This claim of secrecy, however, is more rhetoric than reality. Disclosure of court records is discretionary with the judge in most jurisdictions. Statutory restrictions almost invariably apply only to the court records, and even as to those the evidence is that many courts routinely furnish information to the FBI and the military, and on request to government agencies and even to private employers.33 Of more importance are police records. In most States the police keep a complete file of juvenile 'police contacts' and have complete discretion as to disclosure of juvenile records. Police departments receive requests for information from the FBI and other law-enforcement agencies, the Armed Forces, and social service agencies, and most of them generally comply.34 Private employers word their application forms to produce information concerning juvenile arrests and court proceedings, and in some jurisdictions information concerning juvenile police contacts is furnished private employers as well as government agencies.35\n\n\n37\nIn any event, there is no reason why, consistently with due process, a State cannot continue if it deems it appropriate, to provide and to improve provision for the confidentiality of records of police contacts and court action relating to juveniles. It is interesting to note, however, that the Arizona Supreme Court used the confidentiality argument as a justification for the type of notice which is here attacked as inadequate for due process purposes. The parents were given merely general notice that their child was charged with 'delinquency.' No facts were specified. The Arizona court held, however, as we shall discuss, that in addition to this general 'notice,' the child and his parents must be advised 'of the facts involved in the case' no later than the initial hearing by the judge. Obviously, this does not 'bury' the word about the child's transgressions. It merely defers the time of disclosure to a point when it is of limited use to the child or his parents in preparing his defense or explanation.\n\n\n38\nFurther, it is urged that the juvenile benefits from informal proceedings in the court. The early conception of the Juvenile Court proceeding was one in which a fatherly judge touched the heart and conscience of the erring youth by talking over his problems, by paternal advice and admonition, and in which, in extreme situations, benevolent and wise institutions of the State provided guidance and help 'to save him from downward career.'36 Then, as now, goodwill and compassion were admirably prevalent. But recent studies have, with surprising unanimity, entered sharp dissent as to the validity of this gentle conception. They suggest that the appearance as well as the actuality of fairness, impartiality and orderliness\u2014in short, the essentials of due process\u2014may be a more impressive and more therapeutic attitude so far as the juvenile is concerned. For example, in a recent study, the sociologists Wheeler and Cottrell observe that when the procedural laxness of the 'parens patriae' attitude is followed by stern disciplining, the contrast may have an adverse effect upon the child, who feels that he has been deceived or enticed. They conclude as follows: 'Unless appropriate due process of law is followed, even the juvenile who has violated the law may not feel that he is being fairly treated and may therefore resist the rehabilitative efforts of court personnel.'37 Of course, it is not suggested that juvenile court judges should fail appropriately to take account, in their demeanor and conduct, of the emotional and psychological attitude of the juveniles with whom they are confronted. While due process requirements will, in some instances, introduce a degree of order and regularity to Juvenile Court proceedings to determine delinquency, and in contested cases will introduce some elements of the adversary system, nothing will require that the conception of the kindly juvenile judge be replaced by its opposite,no r do we here rule upon the question whether ordinary due process requirements must be observed with respect to hearings to determine the disposition of the delinquent child.\n\n\n39\nUltimately, however, we confront the reality of that portion of the Juvenile Court process with which we deal in this case. A boy is charged with misconduct. The boy is committed to an institution where he may be restrained of liberty for years. It is of no constitutional consequence\u2014and of limited practical meaning that the institution to which he is committed is called an Industrial School. The fact of the matter is that, however euphemistic the title, a 'receiving home' or an 'industrial school' for juveniles is an institution of confinement in which the child is incarcerated for a greater or lesser time. His world becomes 'a building with whitewashed walls, regimented routine and institutional hours * * *.'38 Instead of mother and father and sisters and brothers and friends and classmates, his world is peopled by guards, custodians, state employees, and 'delinquents' confined with him for anything from waywardness39 to rape and homicide.\n\n\n40\nIn view of this, it would be extraordinary if our Constitution did not require the procedural regularity and the exercise of care implied in the phrase 'due process.' Under our Constitution, the condition of being a boy does not justify a kangaroo court. The traditional ideas of Juvenile Court procedure, indeed, contemplated that time would be available and care would be used to establish precisely what the juvenile did and why he did it\u2014was it a prank of adolescence or a brutal act threatening serious consequences to himself or society unless corrected?40 Under traditional notions, one would assume that in a case like that of Gerald Gault, where the juvenile appears to have a home, a working mother and father, and an older brother, the Juvenile Judge would have made a careful inquiry and judgment as to the possibility that the boy could be disciplined and dealt with at home, despite his previous transgressions.41 Indeed, so far as appears in the record before us, except for some conversation with Gerald about his school work and his 'wanting to go to * * * Grand Canyon with his father,' the points to which the judge directed his attention were little different from those that would be involved in determining any charge of violation of a penal statute.42 The essential difference between Gerald's case and a normal criminal case is that safeguards available to adults were discarded in Gerald's case. The summary procedure as well as the long commitment was possible because Gerald was 15 years of age instead of over 18.\n\n\n41\nIf Gerald had been over 18, he would not have been subject to Juvenile Court proceedings.43 For the particular offense immediately involved, the maximum punishment would have been a fine of $5 to $50, or imprisonment in jail for not more than two months. Instead, he was committed to custody for a maximum of six years. If he had been over 18 and had committed an offense to which such a sentence might apply, he would have been entitled to substantial rights under the Constitution of the United States as well as under Arizona's laws and constitution. The United States Constitution would guarantee him rights and protections with respect to arrest, search, and seizure, and pretrial interrogation. It would assure him of specific notice of the charges and adequate time to decide his course of action and to prepare his defense. He would be entitled to clear advice that he could be represented by counsel, and, at least if a felony were involved, the State would be required to provide counsel if his parents were unable to afford it. If the court acted on the basis of his confession, careful procedures would be required to assure its voluntariness. If the case went to trial, confrontation and opportunity for cross-examination would be guaranteed. So wide a gulf between the State's treatment of the adult and of the child requires a bridge sturdier than mere verbiage, and reasons more persuasive than cliche can provide. As Wheeler and Cottrell have put it, 'The rhetoric of the juvenile court movement has developed without any necessarily close correspondence to the realities of court and institutional routines.'44\n\n\n42\nIn Kent v. United States, supra, we stated that the Juvenile Court Judge's exercise of the power of the state as parens patriae was not unlimited. We said that 'the admonition to function in a 'parental' relationship is not an invitation to procedural arbitrariness.'45 With respect to the waiver by the Juvenile Court to the adult court of jurisdiction over an offense committed by a youth, we said that 'there is no place in our system of law for reaching a result of such tremendous consequences without ceremony without hearing, without effective assistance of counsel, without a statement of reasons.'46 We announced with respect to such waiver proceedings that while 'We do not mean * * * to indicate that the hearing to be held must conform with all of the requirements of a criminal trial or even of the usual administrative hearing; but we do hold that the hearing must measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment.'47 We reiterate this view, here in connection with a juvenile court adjudication of 'delinquency,' as a requirement which is part of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of our Constitution.48\n\n\n43\nWe now turn to the specific issues which are presented to us in the present case.\n\nIII.\n\n44\nNOTICE OF CHARGES.\n\n\n45\nAppellants allege that the Arizona Juvenile Code is unconstitutional or alternatively that the proceedings before the Juvenile Court were constitutionally defective because of failure to provide adequate notice of the hearings. No notice was given to Gerald's parents when he was taken into custody on Monday, June 8. On that night, when Mrs. Gault went to the Detention Home, she was orally informed that there would be a hearing the next afternoon and was told the reason why Gerald was in custody. The only written notice Gerald's parents received at any time was a note on plain paper from Officer Flagg delivered on Thursday or Friday, June 11 or 12, to the effect that the judge had set Monday, June 15, 'for further Hearings on Gerald's delinquency.'\n\n\n46\nA 'petition' was filed with the court on June 9 by Officer Flagg, reciting only that he was informed and believed that 'said minor is a delinquent minor and that it is necessary that some order be made by the Honorable Court for said minor's welfare.' The applicable Arizona statute provides for a petition to be filed in Juvenile Court, alleging in general terms that the child is 'neglected, dependent or delinquent.' The statute explicitly states that such a general allegation is sufficient, 'without alleging the facts.'49 There is no requirement that the petition be served and it was not served upon, given to, or shown to Gerald or his parents.50\n\n\n47\nThe Supreme Court of Arizona rejected appellants' claim that due process was denied because of inadequate notice. It stated that 'Mrs. Gault knew the exact nature of the charge against Gerald from the day he was taken to the detention home.' The court also pointed out that the Gaults appeared at the two hearings 'without objection.' The court held that because 'the policy of the juvenile law is to hide youthful errors from the full gaze of the public and bury them in the graveyard of the forgotten past,' advanc n otice of the specific charges or basis for taking the juvenile into custody and for the hearing is not necessary. It held that the appropriate rule is that 'the infant and his parents or guardian will receive a petition only reciting a conclusion of delinquency.51 But no later than the initial hearing by the judge, they must be advised of the facts involved in the case. If the charges are denied, they must be given a reasonable period of time to prepare.'\n\n\n48\nWe cannot agree with the court's conclusion that adequate notice was given in this case. Notice, to comply with due process requirements, must be given sufficiently in advance of scheduled court proceedings so that reasonable opportunity to prepare will be afforded, and it must 'set forth the alleged misconduct with particularity.'52 It is obvious, as we have discussed above, that no purpose of shielding the child from the public stigma of knowledge of his having been taken into custody and scheduled for hearing is served by the procedure approved by the court below. The 'initial hearing' in the present case was a hearing on the merits. Notice at that time is not timely; and even if there were a conceivable purpose served by the deferral proposed by the court below, it would have to yield to the requirements that the child and his parents or guardian be notified, in writing, of the specific charge or factual allegations to be considered at the hearing, and that such written notice be given at the earliest practicable time, and in any event sufficiently in advance of the hearing to permit preparation. Due process of law requires notice of the sort we have described\u2014that is, notice which would be deemed constitutionally adequate in a civil or criminal proceeding.53 It does not allow a hearing to be held in which a youth's freedom and his parents' right to his custody are at stake without giving them timely notice, in advance of the hearing, of the specific issues that they must meet. Nor, in the circumstances of this case, can it reasonably be said that the requirement of notice was waived.54\n\nIV.\nRIGHT TO COUNSEL\n\n49\nAppellants charge that the Juvenile Court proceedings were fatally defective because the court did not advise Gerald or his parents of their right to counsel, and proceeded with the hearing, the adjudication of delinquency and the order of commitment in the absence of counsel for the child and his parents or an express waiver of the right thereto. The Supreme Court of Arizona pointed out that '(t)here is disagreement (among the various jurisdictions) as to whether the court must advise the infant that he has a right to counsel.'55 It noted its own decision in Arizona State Dept. of Public Welfare v. Barlow, 80 Ariz. 249, 296 P.2d 298 (1956), to the effect 'that the parents of an infant in a juvenile proceeding cannot be denied representation by counsel of their choosing.' (Emphasis added.) It referred to a provision of the Juvenile Code which it characterized as requiring 'that the probation officer shall look after the interests of neglected, delinquent and dependent children,' including representing their interests in court.56 The court argued that 'The parent and the probation officer may be relied upon to protect the infant's interests.' Accordingly it rejected the proposition that 'due process requires that an infant have a right to counsel.' It said that juvenile courts have the discretion, but not the duty, to allow such representation; it referred specifically to the situation in which the Juvenile Court discerns conflict between the child and his parents as an instance in which this discretion might be exercised. We do not agree. Probation officers, in the Arizona scheme, are also arresting officers. They initiate proceedings and file petitions which they verify, as here, alleging the delinquency of the child; and they testify, as here, against the child. And here the probation officer was also superintendent of the Detention Home. The probation officer cannot act as counsel for the child. His role in the adjudicatory hearing, by statute and in fact, is as arresting officer and witness against the child. Nor can the judge represent the child. There is no material difference in this respect between adult and juvenile proceedings of the sort here involved. In adult proceedings, this contention has been foreclosed by decisions of this Court.57 A proceeding where the issue is whether the child will be found to be 'delinquent' and subjected to the loss of his liberty for years is comparable in seriousness to a felony prosecution. The juvenile needs the assistance of counsel to cope with problems of law,58 to make skilled inquiry into the facts, to insist upon regularity of the proceedings, and to ascertain whether he has a defense and to prepare and submit it. The child 'requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him.'59 Just as in Kent v. United States, supra, 383 U.S., at 561\u2014562, 86 S.Ct., at 1057\u20141058, we indicated our agreement with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that the assistance of counsel is essential for purposes of waiver proceedings, so we hold now that it is equally essential for the determination of delinquency, carrying with it the awesome prospect of incarceration in a state institution until the juvenile reaches the age of 21.60\n\n\n50\nDuring the last decade, court decisions,61 experts,62 and legislatures63 have demonstrated increasing recognition of this view. In at least one-third of the States, statutes now provide for the right of representation by retained counsel in juvenile delinquency proceedings, notice of the right, or assignment of counsel, or a combination of these. In other States, court rules have similar provisions.64\n\n\n51\nThe President's Crime Commission has recently recommended that in order to assure 'procedural justice for the child,' it is necessary that 'Counsel * * * be appointed as a matter of course wherever coercive action is a possibility, without requiring any affirmative choice by child or parent.'65 As stated by the authoritative 'Standards\n\n\n52\nz for Juvenile and Family Courts,' published by the Children's Bureau of the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare:\n\n\n53\n'As a component part of a fair hearing required by due      process guaranteed under the 14th amendment, notice of the      right to counsel should be required at all hearings and      counsel provided upon request when the family is financially      unable to employ counsel.' Standards, p. 57.\n\n\n54\nThis statement was 'reviewed' by the National Council of Juvenile Court Judges at its 1965 Convention and they 'found no fault' with it.66 The New York Family Court Act contains the following statement:\n\n\n55\n'This act declares that minors have a right to the assistance      of counsel of their own choosing or of law guardians67 in      neglect proceedings under article three and in proceedings to      determine juvenile delinquency and whether a person is in      need of supervision under article seven. This declaration is      based on a finding that counsel is often indispensable to a      practical realization of due process of law and may be      helpful in making reasoned determinations of fact and proper      orders of disposition.'68\n\n\n56\nThe Act provides that 'At the commencement of any hearing' under the delinquency article of the statute, the juvenile and his parent shall be advised of the juvenile's 'right to be represented by counsel chosen by him or his parent * * * or by a law guardian assigned by the court * * *.'69 The California Act (1961) also requires appointment of counsel.70\n\n\n57\nWe conclude that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that in respect of proceedings to determine delinquency which may result in commitment to an institution in which the juvenile's freedom is curtailed, the child and his parents must be notified of the child's right to be represented by counsel retained by them, or if they are unable to afford counsel, that counsel will be appointed to represent the child.\n\n\n58\nAt the habeas corpus proceeding, Mrs. Gault testified that she knew that she could have appeared with counsel at the juvenile hearing. This knowledge is not a waiver of the right to counsel which she and her juvenile son had, as we have defined it. They had a right expressly to be advised that they might retain counsel and to be confronted with the need for specific consideration of whether they did or did not choose to waive the right. If they were unable to afford to employ counsel, they were entitled in view of the seriousness of the charge and the potential commitment, to appointed counsel, unless they chose waiver. Mrs. Gault's knowledge that she could employ counsel was not an 'intentional relinquishment or abandonment' of a fully known right.71\n\nV.\n\n59\nCONFRONTATION, SELF-INCRIMINATION, CROSS-EXAMINATION\n\n\n60\nAppellants urge that the writ of habeas corpus should have been granted because of the denial of the rights of confrontation and cross-examination in the Juvenile Court hearings, and because the privilege against self-incrimination was not observed. The Juvenile Court Judge testified at the habeas corpus hearing that he had proceeded on the basis of Gerald's admissions at the two hearings. Appellants attack this on the ground that the admissions were obtained in disregard of the privilege against self-incrimination.72 If the confession is disregarded, appellants argue that the delinquency conclusion, since it was fundamentally based on a finding that Gerald had made lewd remarks during the phone call to Mrs. Cook, is fatally defective for failure to accord the rights of confrontation and cross-examination which the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution guarantees in state proceedings generally.73\n\n\n61\nOur first question, then, is whether Gerald's admission was improperly obtained and relied on as the basis of decision, in conflict with the Federal Constitution. For this purpose, it is necessary briefly to recall the relevant facts.\n\n\n62\nMrs. Cook, the complainant, and the recipient of the alleged telephone call, was not called as a witness. Gerald's mother asked the Juvenile Court Judge why Mrs. Cook was not present and the judge replied that 'she didn't have to be present.' So far as appears, Mrs. Cook was spoken to only once, by Officer Flagg, and this was by telephone. The judge did not speak with her on any occasion. Gerald had been questioned by the probation officer after having been taken into custody. The exact circumstances of this questioning do not appear but any admissions Gerald may have made at this time do not appear in the record.74 Gerad  was also questioned by the Juvenile Court Judge at each of the two hearings. The judge testified in the habeas corpus proceeding that Gerald admitted making 'some of the lewd statements * * * (but not) any of the more serious lewd statements.' There was conflict and uncertainty among the witnesses at the habeas corpus proceeding\u2014the Juvenile Court Judge, Mr. and Mrs. Gault, and the probation officer\u2014as to what Gerald did or did not admit.\n\n\n63\nWe shall assume that Gerald made admissions of the sort described by the Juvenile Court Judge, as quoted avove. Neither Gerald nor his parents were advised that he did not have to testify or make a statement, or that an incriminating statement might result in his commitment as a 'delinquent.'\n\n\n64\nThe Arizona Supreme Court rejected appellants' contention that Gerald had a right to be advised that he need not incriminate himself. It said: 'We think the necessary flexibility for individualized treatment will be enhanced by a rule which does not require the judge to advise the infant of a privilege against self-incrimination.'\n\n\n65\nIn reviewing this conclusion of Arizona's Supreme Court, we emphasize again that we are here concerned only with a proceeding to determine whether a minor is a 'delinquent' and which may result in commitment to a state institution. Specifically, the question is whether, in such a proceeding, an admission by the juvenile may be used against him in the absence of clear and unequivocal evidence that the admission was made with knowledge that he was not obliged to speak and would not be penalized for remaining silent. In light of Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), we must also consider whether, if the privilege against self-incrimination is available, it can effectively be waived unless counsel is present or the right to counsel has been waived.\n\n\n66\nIt has long been recognized that the eliciting and use of confessions or admissions require careful scrutiny. Dean Wigmore states:\n\n\n67\n'The ground of distruct of confessions made in certain      situations is, in a rough and indefinite way, judicial      experience. There has been no careful collection of      statistics of untrue confessions, nor has any great number of      instances been even loosely reported * * * but enough have      been verified to fortify the conclusion, based on ordinary      observation of human conduct, that under certain stresses a      person, especially one of defective mentality or peculiar temperament, may falsely acknowledge guilt. This possibility      arises wherever the innocent person is placed in such a      situation that the untrue acknowledgment of guilt is at the      time the more promising of two alternatives between which he      is obliged to choose; that is, he chooses any risk that may      be in falsely acknowledging guilt, in preference to some      worse alternative associated with silence.\n\n\n68\n'The principle, then, upon which a confession may be excluded      is that it is, under certain conditions, testimonially      untrustworthy * * *. (T)he essential feature is that the      principle of exclusion is a testimonial one, analogous to the      other principles which exclude narrations as untrustworthy *      * *.'75\n\n\n69\nThis Court has emphasized that admissions and confessions of juveniles require special caution. In Haley v. State of Ohio, 332 U.S. 596, 68 S.Ct. 302, 92 L.Ed. 224, where this Court reversed the conviction of a 15-year-old boy for murder, Mr. Justice Douglas said:\n\n\n70\n'What transpired would make us pause for careful inquiry if a      mature man were involved. And when, as here, a mere child\u2014an      easy victim of the law\u2014is before us, special care in      scrutinizing the record must be used. Age 15 is a tender and      difficult age for a boy of any race. He cannot be judged by      themo re exacting standards of maturity. That which would      leave a man could and unimpressed can overawe and overwhelm a      lad in his early teens. This is the period of great      instability which the crisis of adolescence produces. A      15-year-old lad, questioned through the dead of night by      relays of police, is a ready victim of the inquisition.      Mature men possibly might stand the ordeal from midnight to 5 a.m. But we cannot believe that a lad of tender years is      a match for the police in such a contest. He needs counsel      and support if he is not to become the victim first of fear,      then of panic. He needs someone on whom to lean lest the      overpowering presence of the law, as he knows it, crush him.      No friend stood at the side of this 15-year-old boy as the      police, working in relays, questioned him hour after hour,      from midnight until dawn. No lawyer stood guard to make sure      that the police went so far and no farther, to see to it that      they stopped short of the point where he became the victim of      coercion. No counsel or friend was called during the critical      hours of questioning.'76\n\n\n71\nIn Haley, as we have discussed, the boy was convicted in an adult court, and not a juvenile court. In notable decisions, the New York Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of New Jersey have recently considered decisions of Juvenile Courts in which boys have been adjudged 'delinquent' on the basis of confessions obtained in circumstances comparable to those in Haley. In both instances, the State contended before its highest tribunal that constitutional requirements governing inculpatory statements applicable in adult courts do not apply to juvenile proceedings. In each case, the State's contention was rejected, and the juvenile court's determination of delinquency was set aside on the grounds of inadmissibility of the confession. In Matters of W. and S., 19 N.Y.2d 55, 277 N.Y.S.2d 675, 224 N.E.2d 102 (1966) (opinion by Keating, J.), and In Interests of Carlo and Stasilowicz, 48 N.J. 224, 225 A.2d 110 (1966) (opinion by Proctor, J.).\n\n\n72\nThe privilege against self-incrimination is, of course, related to the question of the safeguards necessary to assure that admissions or confessions are reasonably trustworthy, that they are not the mere fruits of fear or coercion, but are reliable expressions of the truth. The roots of the privilege are, however, far deeper. They tap the basic stream of religious and political principle because the privilege reflects the limits of the individual's attornment to the state and\u2014in a philosophical sense insists upon the equality of the individual and the state.77 In other words, the privilege has a broader and deeper thrust than the rule which prevents the use of confessions which are the product of coercion because coercion is thought to carry with it the danger of unreliability. One of its purposes is to prevent the state, whether by force or by psychological domination, from overcoming the mind and will of the person under investigation and depriving him of the freedom to decide whether to assist the state in securing his conviction.78\n\n\n73\nIt would indeed be surprising if the privilege against self-incrimination were available to hardened criminals but not to children. The language of the Fifth Amendment, applicable to the States by operation of the Fourteenth Amendment, is unequivocal and without exception. And the scope of the privilege is comprehensive. As Mr. Justice White, concrr ing, stated in Murphy v. Waterfront Commission, 378 U.S. 52, 94, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 1611, 12 L.Ed.2d 678 (1964):\n\n\n74\n'The privilege can be claimed in any proceeding, be it      criminal or civil, administrative or judicial, investigatory      or adjudicatory. * * * it protects any disclosures which the witness may reasonably apprehend could be      used in a criminal prosecution or which could lead to other      evidence that might be so used.'79 (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n75\nWith respect to juveniles, both common observation and expert opinion emphasize that the 'distrust of confessions made in certain situations' to which Dean Wigmore referred in the passage quoted supra, at 44-45, is imperative in the case of children from an early age through adolescence. In New York, for example, the recently enacted Family Court Act provides that the juvenile and his parents must be advised at the start of the hearing of his right to remain silent.80 The New York statute also provides that the police must attempt to communicate with the juvenile's parents before questioning him,81 and that absent 'special circumstances' a confession may not be obtained from a child prior to notifying his parents or relatives and releasing the child either to them or to the Family Court.82 In In Matters of W. and S., referred to above, the New York Court of Appeals held that the privilege against self-incrimination applies in juvenile delinquency cases and requires the exclusion of involuntary confessions, and that People v. Lewis, 260 N.Y. 171, 183 N.E. 353, 86 A.L.R. 1001 (1932), holding the contrary, had been specifically overruled by statute.\n\n\n76\nThe authoritative 'Standards for Juvenile and Family Courts' concludes that, 'Whether or not transfer to the criminal court is a possibility, certain procedures should always be followed. Before being interviewed (by the police), the child and his parents should be informed of his right to have legal counsel present and to refuse to answer questions or be fingerprinted83 if he should so decide.'84\n\n\n77\nAgainst the application to juveniles of the right to silence, it is argued that juvenile proceedings are 'civil' and not 'criminal,' and therefore the privilege should not apply. It is true that the statement of the privilege in the Fifth Amendment, which is applicable to the States by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment, is that no person 'shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.' However, it is also clear that the availability of the privilege does not turn upon the type of proceeding in which its protection is invoked, but upon the nature of the statement or admission and the exposure which it invites. The privilege may, for example, be claimed in a civil or administrative proceeding, if the statement is or may be inculpatory.85\n\n\n78\nIt would be entirely unrealistic to carve out of the Fifth Amendment all statements by juveniles on the ground that these cannot lead to 'criminal' involvement. In the first place, juvenile proceedings to determine'd elinquency,' which may lead to commitment to a state institution, must be regarded as 'criminal' for purposes of the privilege against self-incrimination. To hold otherwise would be to disregard substance because of the feeble enticement of the 'civil' label-of-convenience which has been attached to juvenile proceedings. Indeed, in over half of the States, there is not even assurance that the juvenile will be kept in separate institutions, apart from adult 'criminals.' In those States juveniles may be placed in or transferred to adult penal institutions86 after having been found 'delinquent' by a juvenile court. For this purpose, at least, commitment is a deprivation of liberty. It is incarceration against one's will, whether it is called 'criminal' or 'civil.' And our Constitution guarantees that no person shall be 'compelled' to be a witness against himself when he is threatened with deprivation of his liberty\u2014a command which this Court has broadly applied and generously implemented in accordance with the teaching of the history of the privilege and its great office in mankind's battle for freedom.87\n\n\n79\nIn addition, apart from the equivalence for this purpose of exposure to commitment as a juvenile delinquent and exposure to imprisonment as an adult offender, the fact of the matter is that there is little or no assurance in Arizona, as in most if not all of the States, that a juvenile apprehended and interrogated by the police or even by the Juvenile Court itself will remain outside of the reach of adult courts as a consequence of the offense for which he has been taken into custody. In Arizona, as in other States, provision is made for Juvenile Courts to relinquish or waive jurisdiction to the ordinary criminal courts.88 In the present case, when Gerald Gault was interrogated concerning violation of a section of the Arizona Criminal Code, it could not be certain that the Juvenile Court Judge would decide to 'suspend' criminal prosecution in court for adults by proceeding to an adjudication in Juvenile Court.89\n\n\n80\nIt is also urged, as the Supreme Court of Arizona here asserted, that the juvenile and presumably his parents should not be advised of the juvenile's right to silence because confession is good for the child as the commencement of the assumed therapy of the juvenile court process, and he should be encouraged to assume an attitude of trust and confidence toward the officials of the juvenile process. This proposition has been subjected to widespread challenge on the basis of current reappraisals of the rhetoric and realities of the handling of juvenile offenders.\n\n\n81\nIn fact, evidence is accumulating that confessions by juveniles do not aid in 'individualized treatment,' as the court below put it, and that compelling the child to answer questions, without warning or advice as to his right to remainsi lent, does not serve this or any other good purpose. In light of the observations of Wheeler and Cottrell,90 and others, it seems probable that where children are induced to confess by 'paternal' urgings on the part of officials and the confession is then followed by disciplinary action, the child's reaction is likely to be hostile and adverse\u2014the child may well feel that he has been led or tricked into confession and that despite his confession, he is being punished.91\n\n\n82\nFurther, authoritative opinion has cast formidable doubt upon the reliability and trustworthiness of 'confessions' by children. This Court's observations in Haley v. State of Ohio are set forth above. The recent decision of the New York Court of Appeals referred to above, In Matters of W. and S. deals with a dramatic and, it is to be hoped, extreme example. Two 12-year-old Negro boys were taken into custody for the brutal assault and rape of two aged domestics, one of whom died as the result of the attack. One of the boys was schizophrenic and had been locked in the security ward of a mental institution at the time of the attacks. By a process that may best be described as bizarre, his confession was obtained by the police. A psychiatrist testified that the boy would admit 'whatever he thought was expected so that he could get out of the immediate situation.' The other 12-year-old also 'confessed.' Both confessions were in specific detail, albeit they contained various inconsistencies. The Court of Appeals, in an opinion by Keating, J., concluded that the confessions were products of the will of the police instead of the boys. The confessions were therefore held involuntary and the order of the Appellate Division affirming the order of the Family Court adjudging the defendants to be juvenile delinquents was reversed.\n\n\n83\nA similar and equally instructive case has recently been decided by the Supreme Court of New Jersey. In Interests of Carlo and Stasilowicz, supra. The body of a 10-year-old girl was found. She had been strangled. Neighborhood boys who knew the girl were questioned. The two appellants, aged 13 and 15, confessed to the police, with vivid detail and some inconsistencies. At the Juvenile Court hearing, both denied any complicity in the killing. They testified that their confessions were the product of fear and fatigue due to extensive police grilling. The Juvenile Court Judge found that the confessions were voluntary and admissible. On appeal, in an extensive opinion by Proctor, J., the Supreme Court of New Jersey reversed. It rejected the State's argument that the constitutional safeguard of voluntariness governing the use of confessions does not apply in proceedings before the Juvenile Court. It pointed out that under New Jersey court rules, juveniles under the age of 16 accused of committing a homicide are tried in a proceeding which 'has all of the appurtenances of a criminal trial,' including participation by the county prosecutor, and requirements that the juvenile be provided with counsel, that a stenographic record be made, etc. It also pointed out that under New Jersey law, the confinement of the boys after reaching age 21 could be extended until they had served the maximum sentence which could have been imposed on an adult for such a homicide, here found to be second-degree murder carrying up to 30 years' imprisonment.92 The court concluded that the confessions were involuntary, stressing that the boys, contrary to statute, were placed in the police station and there interrogated;93 that the parents of both boys were not allowed to see them while they were being interrogated;94 that inconsistencies appeared among the various statements of the boys and with the objective evidence of the crime; and that there were protracted periods of questioning. The court notedth e State's contention that both boys were advised of their constitutional rights before they made their statements, but it held that this should not be given 'significant weight in our determination of voluntariness.'95 Accordingly, the judgment of the Juvenile Court was reversed.\n\n\n84\nIn a recent case before the Juvenile Court of the District of Columbia, Judge Ketcham rejected the proffer of evidence as to oral statements made at police headquarters by four juveniles who had been taken into custody for alleged involvement in an assault and attempted robbery. In the Matter of Four Youths, Nos. 28\u2014776 J, 28\u2014778\u2014J, 28\u2014783\u2014J, 28\u2014859\u2014J, Juvenile Court of the District of Columbia, April 7, 1961. The court explicitly stated that it did not rest its decision on a showing that the statements were involuntary, but because they were untrustworthy. Judge Ketcham said:\n\n\n85\n'Simply stated, the Court's decision in this case rests upon      the considered opinion\u2014after nearly four busy years on the      Juvenile Court bench during which the testimony of thousands      of such juveniles has been heard\u2014that the statements of      adolescents under 18 years of age who are arrested and      charged with violations of law are frequently untrustworthy      and often distort the truth.'\n\n\n86\nWe conclude that the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is applicable in the case of juveniles as it is with respect to adults. We appreciate that special problems may arise with respect to waiver of the privilege by or on behalf of children, and that there may well be some differences in technique but not in principle\u2014depending upon the age of the child and the presence and competence of parents. The participation of counsel will, of course, assist the police, Juvenile Courts and appellate tribunals in administering the privilege. If counsel was not present for some permissible reason when an admission was obtained, the greatest care must be taken to assure that the admission was voluntary, in the sense not only that it was not coerced or suggested, but also that it was not the product of ignorance of rights or of adolescent fantasy, fright or despair.96\n\n\n87\nThe 'confession' of Gerald Gault was first obtained by Officer Flagg, out of the presence of Gerald's parents, without counsel and without advising him of his right to silence, as far as appears. The judgment of the Juvenile Court was stated by the judge to be based on Gerald's admissions in court. Neither 'admission' was reduced to writing, and, to say the least, the process by which the 'admissions,' were obtained and received must be characterized as lacking the certainty and order which are required of proceedings of such formidable consequences.97 Apart from the 'admission,' there was nothing upon which a judgment or finding might be based. There was no sworn testimony. Mrs. Cook, the complainant, was not present. The Arizona Supreme Court held that 'sworn testimony must be required of all witnesses including police officers, probation officers and others who are part of or officially related to the juvenile court structure.' We hold that this is not enough. No reason is suggested or appears for a different rule in respect of sworn testimony in juvenile courts than in adult tribunals. Absent a valid confession adequate to support the determination of the Juvenile Court, confrontation and sworn testimony by witnesses available for cross-examination were essential for a finding of 'delinquency' and an order committing Gerald to a state institution for a maximum of six years.\n\n\n88\nThe recommendations in the Children's Bureau's 'Standards for Juvenile and Family Courts' are in general accord with our conclusions. They state that testimony should be under oath and that only competent, material and relevant evidence under rules applicable to civil cases should be admitted in evidence.98 The New York Family Court Act contains a similar provision.99\n\n\n89\nAs we said in Kent v. United States, 383 U.S. 541, 554, 86 S.Ct. 1045, 1053, 16 L.Ed.2d 84 (1966), with respect to waiver proceedings, 'there is no place in our system of law of reaching a result of such tremendous consequences without ceremony * * *.' We now hold that, absent a valid confession, a determination of delinquency and an order of commitment to a state institution cannot be sustained in the absence of sworn testimony subjected to the opportunity for cross-examination in accordance with our law and constitutional requirements.\n\nVI.\n\n90\nAPPELLATE REVIEW AND TRANSCRIPT OF PROCEEDINGS.\n\n\n91\nAppellants ure  that the Arizona statute is unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause because, as construed by its Supreme Court, 'there is no right of appeal from a juvenile court order * * *.' The court held that there is no right to a transcript because there is no right to appeal and because the proceedings are confidential and any record must be destroyed after a prescribed period of time.100 Whether a transcript or other recording is made, it held, is a matter for the discretion of the juvenile court.\n\n\n92\nThis Court has not held that a State is required by the Federal Constitution 'to provide appellate courts or a right to appellate review at all.'101 In view of the fact that we must reverse the Supreme Court of Arizona's affirmance of the dismissal of the writ of habeas corpus for other reasons, we need not rule on this question in the present case or upon the failure to provide a transcript or recording of the hearings\u2014or, indeed, the failure of the Juvenile Judge to state the grounds for his conclusion. Cf. Kent v. United States, supra, 383 U.S., at 561, 86 S.Ct., at 1057, where we said, in the context of a decision of the juvenile court waiving jurisdiction to the adult court, which by local law, was permissible: '* * * it is incumbent upon the Juvenile Court to accompany its waiver order with a statement of the reasons or considerations therefor.' As the present case illustrates, the consequences of failure to provide an appeal, to record the proceedings, or to make findings or state the grounds for the juvenile court's conclusion may be to throw a burden upon the machinery for habeas corpus, to saddle the reviewing process with the burden of attempting to reconstruct a record, and to impose upon the Juvenile Judge the unseemly duty of testifying under cross-examination as to the events that transpired in the hearings before him.102\n\n\n93\nFor the reasons stated, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n\n\n94\nJudgment reversed and cause remanded with directions.\n\n\n95\nMr. Justice BLACK, concurring.\n\n\n96\nThe juvenile court laws of Arizona and other States, as the Court points out, are the result of plans promoted by humane and forward-looking people to provide a system of courts, procedures, and sanctions deemed to be less harmful and more lenient to children than to adults. For this reason such state laws generally provide less formal and less public methods for the trial of children. In line with this policy, both courts and legislators have shrunk back from labeling these laws as 'criminal' and have preferred to call them 'civil.' This, in part, was to prevent the full application to juvenile court cases of the Bill of Rights safeguards, including notice as provided in the Sixth Amendment,1 the right to counsel guaranteed by the Sixth,2 the right against selfincrimination guaranteed by the Fifth,3 and the right to confrontation guarantee b y the Sixth.4 The Court here holds, however, that these four Bill of Rights safeguards apply to protect a juvenile accused in a juvenile court on a charge under which he can be imprisoned for a term of years. This holding strikes a well-nigh fatal blow to much that is unique about the juvenile courts in the Nation. For this reason, there is much to be said for the position of my Brother STEWART that we should not pass on all these issues until they are more squarely presented. But since the majority of the Court chooses to decide all of these questions, I must either do the same or leave my views unexpressed on the important issues determined. In these circumstances, I feel impelled to express my views.\n\n\n97\nThe juvenile court planners envisaged a system that would practically immunize juveniles from 'punishment' for 'crimes' in an effort to save them from youthful indiscretions and stigmas due to criminal charges or convictions. I agree with the Court, however, that this exalted ideal has failed of achievement since the beginning of the system. Indeed, the state laws from the first one on contained provisions, written in emphatic terms, for arresting and charging juveniles with violations of state criminal laws, as well as for taking juveniles by force of law away from their parents and turning them over to different individuals or groups or for confinement within some state school or institution for a number of years. The latter occurred in this case. Young Gault was arrested and detained on a charge of violating an Arizona penal law by using vile and offensive language to a lady on the telephone. If an adult, he could only have been fined or imprisoned for two months for his conduct. As a juvenile, however, he was put through a more or less secret, informal hearing by the court, after which he was ordered, or more realistically, 'sentenced,' to confinement in Arizona's Industrial School until he reaches 21 years of age. Thus, in a juvenile system designed to lighten or avoid punishment for criminality, he was ordered by the State to six years' confinement in what is in all but name a penitentiary or jail.\n\n\n98\nWhere a person, infant or adult, can be seized by the State, charged, and convicted for violating a state criminal law, and then ordered by the State to be confined for six years, I think the Constitution requires that he be tried in accordance with the guarantees of all the provisions of the Bill of Rights made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. Undoubtedly this would be true of an adult defendant, and it would be a plain denial of equal protection of the laws\u2014an invidious discrimination to hold that others subject to heavier punishments could, because they are children, be denied these same constitutional safeguards. I consequently agree with the Court that the Arizona law as applied here denied to the parents and their son the right of notice, right to counsel, right against self-incrimination, and right to confront the witnesses against young Gault. Appellants are entitled to these rights, not because 'fairness, impartiality and orderliness\u2014in short, the essentials of due process'\u2014require them and not because they are 'the procedural rules which have been fashioned from the generality of due process,' but because they are specifically and unequivocally granted by provisions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments which the Fourteenth Amendment makes applicable to the States.\n\n\n99\nA few words should be added because of the opinion of my Brother HARLAN who rests his concurrence and dissent on the Due Process Clause alone. He reads that clause alone as allowing this Court 'to determine what forms of procedural protection are necessary to guarantee the fundamental fairness of juvenile proceedings' 'in a fashion consistent with the 'traditions and conscience of our people.\" Cf. Rochin v. People of California, 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183. He believes that the Due Process Clause gives this Court the power, upon weighing a 'compelling public interest,' to impose on the States only those specific constitutional rights which the Court deems 'imperative' and 'necessary' to comport with the Court's notions of 'fundamental fairness.'\n\n\n100\nI cannot subscribe to any such interpretation of the Due Process Clause. Nothing in its words or its history permits it, and 'fair distillations of relevant judicial history' are no substitute for the words and history of the clause itself. The phrase 'due process of law' has through the years evolved as the successor in purpose and meaning to the words 'law of the land' in Magna Charta which more plainly intended to call for a trial according to the existing law of the land in effect at the time an alleged offense had been committed. That provision in Magna Charta was designed to prevent defendants from being tried according to criminal laws or proclamations specifically promulgated to fit particular cases or to attach new consequences to old conduct. Nothing done since Magna Charta can be pointed to as intimating that the Due Process Clause gives courts power to fashion laws in order to meet new conditions, to fit the 'decencies' of changed conditions, or to keep their consciences from being shocked by legislation, state or federal.\n\n\n101\nAnd, of course, the existence of such awesome judicial power cannot be buttressed or created by relying on the word 'procedural.' Whether labeled as 'procedural' or 'substantive,' the Bill of Rights safeguards, far from being mere 'tools with which' other unspecified 'rights could be fully vindicated,' are the very vitals of a sound constitutional legal system designed to protect and safeguard the most cherished liberties of a free people. These safeguards were written into our Constitution not by judges but by Constitution makers. Freedom in this Nation will be far less secure the very moment that it is decided that judges can determine which of these safeguards 'should' or 'should not be imposed' according to their notions of what constitutional provisions are consistent with the 'traditions and conscience of our people.' Judges with such power, even though they profess to 'proceed with restraint,' will be above the Constitution, with power to write it, not merely to interpret it, which I believe to be the only power constitutionally committed to judges.\n\n\n102\nThere is one ominous sentence, if not more, in my Brother HARLAN's opinion which bodes ill, in my judgment, both for legislative programs and constitutional commands. Speaking of procedural safeguards in the Bill of Rights, he says:\n\n\n103\n'These factors in combination suggest that legislatures may      properly expect only a cautious deference for their      procedural judgments, but that, conversely, courts must      exercise their special responsibility for procedural      guarantees with care to permit ample scope for achieving the      purposes of legislative programs. * * * (T)he court should      necessarily proceed with restraint.'\n\n\n104\nIt is to be noted here that this case concerns Bill of Rights Amendments; that the 'procedure' power my Brother HARLAN claims for the Court here relates solely to Bill of Rights safeguards; and that he is here claiming for the Court a supreme power to fashion new Bill of Rights safeguards according to the Court's notions of what fits tradition and conscience. I do not believe that the Constitutin  vests any such power in judges, either in the Due Process Clause or anywhere else. Consequently, I do not vote to invalidate this Arizona law on the ground that it is 'unfair' but solely on the ground that it violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendments made obligatory on the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. Cf. Pointer v. State of Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 412, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 1072, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (Goldberg, J., concurring). It is enough for me that the Arizona law as here applied collides head-on with the Fifth and Sixth Amendments in the four respects mentioned. The only relevance to me of the Due Process Clause is that it would, of course, violate due process or the 'law of the land' to enforce a law that collides with the Bill of Rights.\n\n\n105\nMr. Justice WHITE, concurring.\n\n\n106\nI join the Court's opinion except for Part V. I also agree that the privilege against compelled self-incrimination applies at the adjudicatory stage of juvenile court proceedings. I do not, however, find an adequate basis in the record for determination whether that privilege was violated in this case. The Fifth Amendment protects a person from being 'compelled' in any criminal proceeding to be a witness against himself. Compulsion is essential to a violation. It may be that when a judge, armed with the authority he has or which people think he has, asks questions of a party or a witness in an adjudicatory hearing, that person, especially if a minor, would feel compelled to answer, absent a warning to the contrary or similar information from some other source. The difficulty is that the record made at the habeas corpus hearing, which is the only information we have concerning the proceedings in the juvenile court, does not directly inform us whether Gerald Gault or his parents were told of Gerald's right to remain silent; nor does it reveal whether the parties were aware of the privilege from some other source, just as they were already aware that they had the right to have the help of counsel and to have witnesses on their behalf. The petition for habeas corpus did not raise the Fifth Amendment issue nor did any of the witnesses focus on it.\n\n\n107\nI have previously recorded my views with respect to what I have deemed unsound applications of the Fifth Amendment. See, for example, Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 526, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1654, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, and Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 33, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 1506, 12 L.Ed.2d 653, dissenting opinions. These views, of course, have not prevailed. But I do hope that the Court will proceed with some care in extending the privilege, with all its vigor, to proceedings in juvenile court, particularly the nonadjudicatory stages of those proceedings.\n\n\n108\nIn any event, I would not reach the Fifth Amendment issue here. I think the Court is clearly ill-advised to review this case on the basis of Miranda v. State of Arizona, since the adjudication of delinquency took place in 1964, long before the Miranda decision. See Johnson v. State of New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882. Under these circumstances, this case is a poor vehicle for resolving a difficult problem. Moreover, no prejudice to appellants is at stake in this regard. The judgment below must be reversed on other grounds and in the event further proceedings are to be had, Gerald Gault will have counsel available to advise him.\n\n\n109\nFor somewhat similar reasons, I would not reach the questions of confrontation and cross-examination which are also dealt with in Part V of the opinion.\n\n\n110\nMr. Justice HARLAN, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\n111\nEach of the 50 States has created a system of juvenile or family courts, in which distinctive rules are employed and special consequences imposed. The jurisdiction of these courts commonly extends both to cases which the States have withdrawn from the ordinary processes of criminal justice, and to cases which involve acts that, if performed by an adult, would not be penalized as criminal. Such courts re  denominated civil, not criminal, and are characteristically said not to administer criminal penalties. One consequence of these systems, at least as Arizona construes its own, is that certain of the rights guaranteed to criminal defendants by the Constitution are withheld from juveniles. This case brings before this Court for the first time the question of what limitations the the Constitution places upon the operation of such tribunals.1 For reasons which follow, I have concluded that the Court has gone too far in some respects, and fallen short in others, in assessing the procedural requirements demanded by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nI.\n\n112\nI must first acknowledge that I am unable to determine with any certainty by what standards the Court decides that Arizona's juvenile courts do not satisfy the obligations of due process. The Court's premise, itself the product of reasoning which is not described, is that the 'constitutional and theoretical basis' of state systems of juvenile and family courts is 'debatable'; it buttresses these doubts by marshaling a body of opinion which suggests that the accomplishments of these courts have often fallen short of expectations.2 The Court does not indicate at what points or for what purposes such views, held either by it or by other observers, might be pertinent to the present issues. Its failure to provide any discernible standard for the measurement of due process in relation to juvenile proceedings unfortunately might be understood to mean that the Court is concerned principally with the wisdom of having such courts at all.\n\n\n113\nIf this is the source of the Court's dissatisfaction, I cannot share it. I should have supposed that the constitutionality of juvenile courts was beyond proper question under the standards now employed to assess the substantive validity of state legislation under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It can scarcely be doubted that it is within the State's competence to adopt measures reasonably calculated to meet more effectively the persistent problems of juvenile delinquency; as the opinion for the Court makes abundantly plain, these are among the most vexing and ominous of the concerns which now face communities throughout the country.\n\n\n114\nThe proper issue here is, however, not whether the State may constitutionally treat juvenile offenders through a system of specialized courts, but whether the proceedings in Arizona's juvenile courts include procedural guarantees which satisfy the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. Among the first premises of our constitutional system is the obligation to conduct any proceeding in which an individual may be deprived of liberty or property in a fashion consistent with the 'traditions and conscience of our people.' Snyder v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 105, 54 S.Ct. 330, 332, 78 L.Ed. 674. The importance of these procedural guarantees is doubly intensified here. First, many of the problems with which Arizona is concerned are among those traditionally confined to the processes of criminal justice; their disposition necessarily affects in the most direct and substantial manner the liberty of individual citizens. Quite obviously, systems of specialized penal justice might permit erosion, or even evasion, of the limitations placed by the Cns titution upon state criminal proceedings. Second, we must recognize that the character and consequences of many juvenile court proceedings have in fact closely resembled those of ordinary criminal trials. Nothing before us suggests that juvenile courts were intended as a device to escape constitutional constraints, but I entirely agree with the Court that we are nonetheless obliged to examine with circumspection the procedural guarantees the State has provided.\n\n\n115\nThe central issue here, and the principal one upon which I am divided from the Court, is the method by which the procedural requirements of due process should be measured. It must at the outset be emphasized that the protections necessary here cannot be determined by resort to any classification of juvenile proceedings either as criminal or as civil, whether made by the State or by this Court. Both formulae are simply too imprecise to permit reasoned analysis of these difficult constitutional issues. The Court should instead measure the requirements of due process by reference both to the problems which confront the State and to the actual character of the procedural system which the State has created. The Court has for such purposes chiefly examined three connected sources: first, the 'settled usages and modes of proceeding,' Den ex dem. Murray v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 277, 15 L.Ed. 372; second, the 'fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions'. Hebert v. State of Louisiana, 272 U.S. 312, 316, 47 S.Ct. 103, 104, 71 L.Ed. 270 and third, the character and requirements of the circumstances presented in each situation. FCC v. WJR, The Goodwill Station, 337 U.S. 265, 277, 69 S.Ct. 1097, 1104, 93 L.Ed. 1353; Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 64 S.Ct. 660, 88 L.Ed. 834. See, further, my dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 522, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 1765, 6 L.Ed.2d 989, and compare my opinion concurring in the result in Pointer v. State of Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 408, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 1070. Each of these factors is relevant to the issues here, but it is the last which demands particular examination.\n\n\n116\nThe Court has repeatedly emphasized that determination of the constitutionally required procedural safeguards in any situation requires recognition both of the 'interests affected' and of the 'circumstances involved.' FCC v. WJR, The Goodwill Station, supra, 337 U.S. at 277, 69 S.Ct. at 1104. In particular, a 'compelling public interest' must, under our cases, be taken fully into account in assessing the validity under the due process clauses of state or federal legislation and its application. See, e.g., Yakus v. United States, supra, 321 U.S. at 442, 64 S.Ct. at 675; Bowles v. Willingham, 321 U.S. 503, 520, 64 S.Ct. 641, 650, 88 L.Ed. 892; Miller v. Schoene, 276 U.S. 272, 279, 48 S.Ct. 246, 247, 72 L.Ed. 568. Such interests would never warrant arbitrariness or the diminution of any specifically assured constitutional right, Home Bldg. & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398, 426, 54 S.Ct. 231, 235, 78 L.Ed. 413, but they are an essential element of the context through which the legislation and proceedings under it must be read and evaluated.\n\n\n117\nNo more evidence of the importance of the public interests at stake here is required than that furnished by the opinion of the Court; it indicates that 'some 601,000 children under 18, or 2% of all children between 10 and 17, came before juvenile courts' in 1965, and that 'about one-fifth of all arrests for serious crimes' in 1965 were of juveniles. The Court adds that the rate of juvenile crime is steadily rising. All this, as the Court suggests, indicates the importance of these due process issues, but it mirrors no less vividly that state authorities are confronted by formidable and immediate problems involving the most fundamental social values. The state legislatures have determined that the most hopeful solution for these problems is to be found in speciaiz ed courts, organized under their own rules and imposing distinctive consequences. The terms and limitations of these systems are not identical, nor are the procedural arrangements which they include, but the States are uniform in their insistence that the ordinary processes of criminal justice are inappropriate, and that relatively informal proceedings, dedicated to premises and purposes only imperfectly reflected in the criminal law, are instead necessary.\n\n\n118\nIt is well settled that the Court must give the widest deference to legislative judgments that concern the character and urgency of the problems with which the State is confronted. Legislatures are, as this Court has often acknowledged, the 'main guardian' of the public interest, and, within their constitutional competence, their understanding of that interest must be accepted as 'wellnigh' conclusive. Berman v. Parker, 348 U.S. 26, 32, 75 S.Ct. 98, 102, 99 L.Ed. 27. This principle does not, however, reach all the questions essential to the resolution of this case. The legislative judgments at issue here embrace assessments of the necessity and wisdom of procedural guarantees; these are questions which the Constitution has entrusted at least in part to courts, and upon which courts have been understood to possess particular competence. The fundamental issue here is, therefore, in what measure and fashion the Court must defer to legislative determinations which encompass constitutional issues of procedural protection.\n\n\n119\nIt suffices for present purposes to summarize the factors which I believe to be pertinent. It must first be emphasized that the deference given to legislators upon substantive issues must realistically extend in part to ancillary procedural questions. Procedure at once reflects and creates substantive rights, and every effort of courts since the beginnings of the common law to separate the two has proved essentially futile. The distinction between them is particularly inadequate here, where the legislature's substantive preferences directly and unavoidably require judgments about procedural issues. The procedural framework is here a principal element of the substantive legislative system; meaningful deference to the latter must include a portion of deference to the former. The substantive-procedural dichotomy is, nonetheless, an indispensable tool of analysis, for it stems from fundamental limitations upon judicial authority under the Constitution. Its premise is ultimately that courts may not substitute for the judgments of legislators their own understanding of the public welfare, but must instead concern themselves with the validity under the Constitution of the methods which the legislature has selected. See e.g., McLean v. State of Arkansas, 211 U.S. 539, 547, 29 S.Ct. 206, 208, 53 L.Ed. 315; Olsen v. State of Nebraska, 313 U.S. 236, 246\u2014247, 61 S.Ct. 862, 865, 85 L.Ed. 1305. The Constitution has in this manner created for courts and legislators areas of primary responsibility which are essentially congruent to their areas of special competence. Courts are thus obliged both by constitutional command and by their distinctive functions to bear particular responsibility for the measurement of procedural due process. These factors in combination suggest that legislatures may properly expect only a cautious deference for their procedural judgments, but that, conversely, courts must exercise their special responsibility for procedural guarantees with care to permit ample scope for achieving the purposes of legislative programs. Plainly, courts can exercise such care only if they have in each case first studied thoroughly the objectives and implementation of the program at stake; if, upon completion of those studies, the effect of extensive procedural restrictions upon valid legislative purposes cannot be assessed with reasonable certainty, the court should necessarily proceed with restraint.\n\n\n120\nThe foregoing considerations, which I believe to be fair distillations of relevant judicial history, suggest three criteria by which the procedural requirements of due process should be measured here: first, no more restrictions should be imposed than are imperative to assure the proceedings' fundamental fairness; second, the restrictions which are imposed should be those which preserve, so far as possible, the essential elements of the State's purpose; and finally, restrictions should be chosen which will later permit the orderly selection of any additional protections which may ultimately prove necessary. In this way, the Court may guarantee the fundamental fairness of the proceeding, and yet permit the State to continue development of an effective response to the problems of juvenile crime.\n\nII.\n\n121\nMeasured by these criteria, only three procedural requirements should, in my opinion, now be deemed required of state juvenile courts by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment: first, timely notice must be provided to parents and children of the nature and terms of any juvenile court proceeding in which a determination affecting their rights or interests may be made; second, unequivocal and timely notice must be given that counsel may appear in any such proceeding in behalf of the child and its parents, and that in cases in which the child may be confined in an institution, counsel may, in circumstances of indigency, be appointed for them; and third, the court must maintain a written record, or its equivalent, adequate to permit effective review on appeal or in collateral proceedings. These requirements would guarantee to juveniles the tools with which their rights could be fully vindicated, and yet permit the States to pursue without unnecessary hindrance the purposes which they believe imperative in this field. Further, their imposition now would later permit more intelligent assessment of the necessity under the Fourteenth Amendment of additional requirements, by creating suitable records from which the character and deficiencies of juvenile proceedings could be accurately judged. I turn to consider each of these three requirements.\n\n\n122\nThe Court has consistently made plain that adequate and timely notice is the fulcrum of due process, whatever the purposes of the proceeding. See, e.g., Roller v. Holly, 176 U.S. 398, 409, 20 S.Ct. 410, 413, 44 L.Ed. 520; Coe v. Armour Fertilizer Works, 237 U.S. 413, 424, 35 S.Ct. 625, 628, 59 L.Ed. 1027. Notice is ordinarily the prerequisite to effective assertion of any constitutional or other rights; without it, vindication of those rights must be essentially fortuitous. So fundamental a protection can neither be spared here nor left to the 'favor or grace' of state authorities. Central of Georgia Ry. v. Wright, 207 U.S. 127, 138, 28 S.Ct. 47, 51, 52 L.Ed. 134; Coe v. Armour Fertilizer Works, supra, 237 U.S. at 425, 35 S.Ct. at 628.\n\n\n123\nProvision of counsel and of a record, like adequate notice, would permit the juvenile to assert very much more effectively his rights and defenses, both in the juvenile proceedings and upon direct or collateral review. The Court has frequently emphasized their importance in proceedings in which an individual may be deprived of his liberty, see Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, and Griffin v. People of State of Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891; this reasoning must include with special force those who are commonly inexperienced and immature. See Powell v. State of Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158. The facts of this case illustrate poignantly the difficulties of review without either an adequate record or the participation of counsel in the proceeding's initial stages. At the same time, these requirements should not cause any substantial modification in the character of juvenile court proceedings: counsel, although now present in only a small percentage of juvenile cases, have apparently already appeared without incident in virtually all juvenile courts;3 and the maintenance of a record should not appreciably alter the conduct of these proceedings.\n\n\n124\nThe question remains whether certain additional requirements, among them the privilege against self-incrimination, confrontation, and cross-examination, must now, as the Court holds, also be imposed. I share in part the views expressed in my Brother WHITE'S concurring opinion, but believe that there are other, and more deep-seated, reasons to defer, at least for the present, the imposition of such requirements.\n\n\n125\nInitially, I must vouchsafe that I cannot determine with certainty the reasoning by which the Court concludes that these further requirements are now imperative. The Court begins from the premise, to which it gives force at several points, that juvenile courts need not satisfy 'all of the requirements of a criminal trial.' It therefore scarcely suffices to explain the selection of these particular procedural requirements for the Court to declare that juvenile court proceedings are essentially criminal, and thereupon to recall that these are requisites for a criminal trial. Nor does the Court's voucher of 'authoritative opinion,' which consists of four extraordinary juvenile cases, contribute materially to the solution of these issues. The Court has, even under its own permises, asked the wrong questions: the problem here is to determine what forms of procedural protection are necessary to guarantee the fundamental fairness of juvenile proceedings, and not which of the procedures now employed in criminal trials should be transplanted intact to proceedings in these specialized courts.\n\n\n126\nIn my view, the Court should approach this question in terms of the criteria, described above, which emerge from the history of due process adjudication. Measured by them, there are compelling reasons at least to defer imposition of these additional requirements. First, quite unlike notice, counsel, and a record, these requirements might radically alter the character of juvenile court proceedings. The evidence from which the Court reasons that they would not is inconclusive,4 and other available evidence suggests that they very likely would.5 At the least, it is plain that these additional requirements would contribute materially to the creation in these proceedings of the atmosphere of an ordinary criminal trial, and would, even if they do no more, thereby largely frustrate a central purpose of these specialized courts. Further, these are restrictions intended to conform to the demands of an intensely adversary system of criminal justice; the broad purposes which they represent might be served in juvenile courts with equal effectiveness by procedural devices more consistent with the premises of proceedings in those courts. As the Court apparently acknowledges, the hazards of self-accusation, for example, might be avoided in juvenile proceedings without the imposition of all the requirements and limitations which surround the privilege against self-incrimination. The guarantee of adequate notice, counsel, and a record would create conditions in which suitable alternative procedures could be devised; but, unfortunately, the Court's haste to impose restrictions taken intact from criminal procedure may well seriously hamper the development of such alternatives. Surely this illustrates that prudence and the principles of the Fourteenth Amendment alike require that the Court should now impose no more procedural restrictions than are imperative to assure fundamental fairness, and that the States should instead be permitted additional opportunities to develop without unnecessary hindrance their systems of juvenile courts.\n\n\n127\nI find confirmation for these views in two ancillary considerations. First, it is clear that an uncertain, but very substantial number of the cases brought to juvenile courts involve children who are not in any sense guilty of criminal misconduct. Many of these children have simply the misfortune to be in some manner distressed; others have engaged in conduct, such as truancy, which is plainly not criminal.6 Efforts are now being made to develop effective, and entirely noncriminal, methods of treatment for these children.7 In such cases, the state authorities are in the most literal sense acting in loco parentis; they are, by any standard, concerned with the child's protection, and not with his punishment. I do not question that the methods employed in such cases must be consistent with the constitutional obligation to act in accordance with due process, but certainly the Fourteenth Amendment does not demand that they be constricted by the procedural guarantees devised for ordinary criminal prosecutions. Cf. State of Minnesota ex rel. Pearson v. Probate Court, 309 U.S. 270, 60 S.Ct. 523, 84 L.Ed. 744. It must be remembered that the various classifications of juvenile court proceedings are, as the vagaries of the available statistics illustrate, often arbitrary or ambiguous; it would therefore be imprudent, at the least, to build upon these classifications rigid systems of procedural requirements which would be applicable, or not, in accordance with the descriptive label given to the particular proceeding. It is better, it seems to me, to begin by now requiring the essential elements of fundamental fairness in juvenile courts, whatever the label given by the State to the proceedings; in this way the Court could avoid imposing unnecessarily rigid restrictions, and yet escape dependence upon classifications which may often prove to be illusory. Further, the provision of notice, counsel, and a record would permit orderly efforts to determine later whether more satisfactory classifications can be devised, and if they can, whether additional procedural requirements are necessary for them under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n128\nSecond, it should not be forgotten that juvenile crime and juvenile courts are both now under earnest study throughout the country. I very much fear that this Court, by imposing these rigid procedural requirements, may inadvertently have served to discourage these efforts to find more satisfactory solutions for the problems of juvenile crime, and may thus now hamper enlightened development of the ys tems of juvenile courts. It is appropriate to recall that the Fourteenth Amendment does not compel the law to remain passive in the midst of change; to demand otherwise denies 'every quality of the law but its age'. Hurtado v. People of State of California, 110 U.S. 516, 529, 4 S.Ct. 111, 117, 28 L.Ed. 232.\n\nIII.\n\n129\nFinally, I turn to assess the validity of this juvenile court proceeding under the criteria discussed in this opinion. Measured by them, the judgment below must, in my opinion, fall. Gerald Gault and his parents were not provided adequate notice of the terms and purposes of the proceedings in which he was adjudged delinquent; they were not advised of their rights to be represented by counsel; and no record in any form was maintained of the proceedings. It follows, for the reasons given in this opinion, that Gerald Gault was deprived of his liberty without due process of law, and I therefore concur in the judgment of the Court.\n\n\n130\nMr. Justice STEWART, dissenting.\n\n\n131\nThe Court today uses an obscure Arizona case as a vehicle to impose upon thousands of juvenile courts throughout the Nation restrictions that the Constitution made applicable to adversary criminal trials.1 I believe the Court's decision is wholly unsound as a matter of constitutional law, and sadly unwise as a matter of judicial policy.\n\n\n132\nJuvenile proceedings are not criminal trials. They are not civil trials. They are simply not adversary proceedings. Whether treating with a delinquent child, a neglected child, a defective child, or a dependent child, a juvenile proceeding's whole purpose and mission is the very opposite of the mission and purpose of a prosecution in a criminal court. The object of the one is correction of a condition. The object of the other is conviction and punishment for a criminal act.\n\n\n133\nIn the last 70 years many dedicated men and women have devoted their professional lives to the enlightened task of bringing us out of the dark world of Charles Dickens in meeting our responsibilities to the child in our society. The result has been the creation in this century of a system of juvenile and family courts in each of the 50 States. There can be no denying that in many areas the performance of these agencies has fallen disappointingly short of the hopes and dreams of the courageous pioneers who first conceived them. For a variety of reasons, the reality has sometimes not even approached the ideal, and much remains to be accomplished in the administration of public juvenile and family agencies\u2014in personnel, in planning, in financing, perhaps in the formulation of wholly new approaches.\n\n\n134\nI possess neither the specialized experience nor the expert knowledge to predict with any certainty where may lie the brightest hope for progress in dealing with the serious problems of juvenile delinquency. But I am certain that the answer does not lie in the Court's opinion in this case, which serves to convert a juvenile proceeding into a criminal prosecution.\n\n\n135\nThe inflexible restrictions that the Constitution so wisely made applicable to adversary criminal trials have no inevitable place in the proceedings of those public social agencies known as juvenile or family courts. And to impose the Court's long catalog of requirements upon juvenile proceedings in every area of the country is to invite a long step backwards into the nineteenth century. In that era there were no juvenile proceedings, and a child was tried in a conventional criminal court will all the trappings of a conventional criminal trial. So it was that a 12-year-old boy named James Guild was tried in New Jersey for killing Catharine Beakes. A jury found him guilty of murder, and he was sentenced to death by hanging. The sentence was executed. It was all very constitutional.2\n\n\n136\nA State in all its dealings must, of course, accord every person due process of law. And due process may require that some of the same restrictions which the Constitution has placed upon criminal trials must be imposed upon juvenile proceedings. For example, I suppose that all would agree that a brutally coerced confession could not constitutionally be considered in a juvenile court hearing. But it surely does not follow that the testimonial privilege against self-incrimination is applicable in all juvenile proceedings.3 Similarly, due process clearly requires timely notice of the purpose and scope of any proceedings affecting the relationship of parent and child. Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 14 L.Ed.2d 62. But it certainly does not follow that notice of a juvenile hearing must be framed with all the technical niceties of a criminal indictment. See Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240.\n\n\n137\nIn any event, there is no reason to deal with issues such as these in the present case. The Supreme Court of Arizona found that the parents of Gerald Gault 'knew of their right to counsel, to subpoena and cross examine witnesses, of the right to confront the witnesses against Gerald and the possible consequences of a finding of delinquency.' 99 Ariz. 181, 185, 407 P.2d 760, 763. It further found that 'Mrs. Gault knew the exact nature of the charge against Gerald from the day he was taken to the detention home.' 99 Ariz., at 193, 407 P.2d, at 768. And, as Mr. Justice WHITE correctly points out, pp. 64-65, ante, no issue of compulsory self-incrimination is presented by this case.\n\n\n138\nI would dismiss the appeal.\n\n\n\n1\n Under Arizona law, juvenile hearings are conducted by a judge of the Superior Court, designated by his colleagues on the Superior Court to serve as Juvenile Court Judge. Arizona Const., Art. 6, \u00a7 15, A.R.S.; Arizona Revised Statutes (hereinafter ARS) \u00a7\u00a7 8\u2014201, 8\u2014202.\n\n\n2\n There is a conflict between the recollection of Mrs. Gault and that of Officer Flagg. Mrs. Gault testified that Gerald was released on Friday, June 12, Officer Flagg that it had been on Thursday, June 11. This was from memory; he had no record, and the note hereafter referred to was undated.\n\n\n3\n Officer Flagg also testified that Gerald had not, when questioned at the Detention Home, admitted having made any of the lewd statements, but that each boy had sought to put the blame on the other. There was conflicting testimony as to whether Ronald had accused Gerald of making the lewd statements during the June 15 hearing.\n\n\n4\n Judge McGhee also testified that Gerald had not denied 'certain statements' made to him at the hearing by Officer Henderson.\n\n\n5\n 'Q. All right. Now, Judge, would you tell me under what section of the law or tell me under what section of\u2014of the code you found the boy delinquent?\n'A. Well, there is a\u2014I think it amounts to disturbing the peace. I can't give you the section, but I can tell you the law, that when one person uses lewd language in the presence of another person, that it can amount to\u2014and I consider that when a person makes it over the phone, that it is considered in the presence, I might be wrong, that is one section. The other section upon which I consider the boy delinquent is Section 8\u2014201, Subsection (d), habitually involved in immoral matters.'\n\n\n6\n ARS \u00a7 8\u2014201, subsec. 6, the section of the Arizona Juvenile Code which defines a delinquent child, reads:\n\"Delinquent child' includes:\n'(a) A child who has violated a law of the state or an ordinance or regulation of a political subdivision thereof.\n'(b) A child who, by reason of being incorrigible, wayward or habitually disobedient, is uncontrolled by his parent, guardian or custodian.\n'(c) A child who is habitually truant from school or home.\n'(d) A child who habitually so deports himself as to injure or endanger the morals or health of himself or others.'\n\n\n7\n For example, the laws of Arizona allow arrest for a misdemeanor only if a warrant is obtained or if it is committed in the presence of the officer. ARS \u00a7 13\u20141403. The Supreme Court of Arizona held that this is inapplicable in the case of juveniles. See ARS \u00a7 8\u2014221 which relates specifically to juveniles. But compare Two Brothers and a Case of Liquor, Juv.Ct.D.C., Nos. 66 2652\u2014J, 66\u20142653\u2014J, December 28, 1966 (opinion of Judge Ketcham); Standards for Juvenile and Family Courts, Children's Bureau Pub. No. 437\u20141966, p. 47 (hereinafter cited as Standards); New York Family Court Act \u00a7 721 (1963) (hereinafter cited as N.Y.Family Court Act).\nThe court also held that the judge may consider hearsay if it is 'of a kind on which reasonable men are accustomed to rely in serious affairs.' But compare Note, Juvenile Delinquents: The Police, State Courts, and Individualized Justice, 79 Harv.L.Rev. 775, 794\u2014795 (1966) (hereinafter cited as Harvard Law Review Note):\n'The informality of juvenile court hearings frequently leads to the admission of hearsay and unsworn testimony. It is said that 'close adherence to the strict rules of evidence might prevent the court from obtaining important facts as to the child's character and condition which could only be to the child's detriment.' The assumption is that the judge will give normally inadmissible evidence only its proper weight. It is also declared in support of these evidentiary practices that the juvenile court is not a criminal court, that the importance of the hearsay rule has been overestimated, and that allowing an attorney to make 'technical objections' would disrupt the desired informality of the proceedings. But to the extent that the rules of evidence are not merely technical or historical, but like the hearsay rule have a sound basis in human experience, they should not be rejected in any judicial inquiry. Juvenile court judges in Los Angeles, Tucson, and Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin report that they are satisfied with the operation of their courts despite application of unrelaxed rules of evidence.' (Footnote omitted.)\nIt ruled that the correct burden of proof is that 'the juvenile judge must be persuaded by clear and convincing evidence that the infant has committed the alleged delinquent act.' Compare the 'preponderance of the evidence' test, .Y .Family Court Act \u00a7 744 (where maximum commitment is three years, \u00a7\u00a7 753, 758). Cf.

The number of Juvenile Judges as of 1964 is listed as 2,987, of whom 213 are full-time Juvenile Court Judges. Id., at 305. The Nat'l Crime Comm'n Report indicates that half of these judges have no undergraduate degree, a fifth have no college education at all, a fifth are not members of the bar, and three-quarters devote less than one-quarter of their time to juvenile matters. See also McCune, Profile of the Nation's Juvenile Court Judges (monograph, George Washington University, Center for the Behavioral Sciences, 1965), which is a detailed statistical study of Juvenile Court Judges, and indicates additionally that about a quarter of these judges have no law school training at all. About one-third of all judges have no probation and social work staff available to them; between eighty and ninety percent have no available psychologist or psychiatrist. Ibid. It has been observed that while 'good will, compassion, and similar virtues are * * * admirably prevalent throughout the system * * * expertise, the keystone of the whole venture, is lacking.' Harvard Law Review Note, p. 809. In 1965, over 697,000 delinquency cases (excluding traffic) were disposed of in these courts, involving some 601,000 children, or 2% of all children between 10 and 17.

But see Waite, How Far Can Court Procedure Be Socialized Without Impairing Individual Rights, 12 J.Crim.L. & Criminology 339, 340 (1922): 'The court which must direct its procedure even apparently to do something to a child because of what he has done, is parted from the court which is avowedly concerned only with doing something for a child because of what he is and needs, by a gulf too wide to be bridged by any humanity which the judge may introduce into his hearings, or by the habitual use of corrective rather than punitive methods after conviction.'\n\n\n19\n Paulsen, op. cit. supra, n. 15, at 173; Hurley, Origin of the Illinois Juvenile Court Law, in The Child, The Clinic, and the Court (1925), pp. 320, 328.\n\n\n20\n Julian Mack, The Chancery Procedure in the Juvenile Court, in The Child, The Clinic, and the Court (1925), p. 310.\n\n\n21\n See, e.g., Shears, Legal Problems Peculiar to Children's Courts, 48 A.B.A.J. 719, 720 (1962) ('The basic right of a juvenile is not to liberty but to custody. He has the right to have someone take care of him, and if his parents do not afford him this custodial privilege, the law must do so.'); Ex parte Crouse, 4 Whart. 9, 11 (Sup.Ct.Pa.1839); Petition of Ferrier, 103 Ill. 367, 371\u2014373 (1882).\n\n\n22\n The Appendix to the opinion of Judge Prettyman in Pee v. United States, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 47, 274 F.2d 556 (1959), lists authority in 51 jurisdictions to this effect. Even rules required by due process in civil proceedings, however, have not generally been deemed compulsory as to proceedings affecting juveniles. For example, constituton al requirements as to notice of issues, which would commonly apply in civil cases, are commonly disregarded in juvenile proceedings, as this case illustrates.\n\n\n23\n 'There is evidence * * * that there may be grounds for concern that the child receives the worst of both worlds: that he gets neither the protections accorded to adults nor the solicitous care and regenerative treatment postulated for children.' 383 U.S., at 556, 86 S.Ct., at 1054, citing Handler, The Juvenile Court and the Adversary System: Problems of Function and Form, 1965 Wis.L.Rev. 7; Harvard Law Review Note; and various congressional materials set forth in 383 U.S., at 546, 86 S.Ct., at 1050, n. 5.\nOn the other hand, while this opinion and much recent writing concentrate upon the failures of the Juvenile Court system to live up to the expectations of its founders, the observation of the Nat'l Crime Comm'n Report should be kept in mind:\n'Although its shortcomings are many and its results too often disappointing, the juvenile justice system in many cities is operated by people who are better educated and more highly skilled, can call on more and better facilities and services, and has more ancillary agencies to which to refer its clientele than its adult counterpart.' Id., at 78.\n\n\n24\n Foreword to Young, Social Treatment in Probation and Delinquency (1937), p. xxvii. The 1965 Report of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, 'Law Enforcement\u2014A Report on Equal Protection in the South,' pp. 80\u201483, documents numerous instances in which 'local authorities used the broad discretion afforded them by the absence of safeguards (in the juvenile process)' to punish, intimidate, and obstruct youthful participants in civil rights demonstrations. See also Paulsen, Juvenile Courts, Family Courts, and the Poor Man, 54 Calif.L.Rev. 694, 707\u2014709 (1966).\n\n\n25\n Lehman, A Juvenile's Right to Counsel in a Delinquency Hearing, 17 Juvenile Court Judges Journal 53, 54 (1966).\nCompare the observation of the late Arthur T. Vanderbilt, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New Jersey, in a foreword to Virtue, Basic Structure for Children's Services in Michigan (1953), p. x:\n'In their zeal to care for children neither juvenile judges nor welfare workers can be permitted to violate the Constitution, especially the constitutional provisions as to due process that are involved in moving a child from its home. The indispensable elements of due process are: first, a tribunal with jurisdiction; second, notice of a hearing to the proper parties; and finally, a fair hearing. All three must be present if we are to treat the cil d as an individual human being and not to revert, in spite of good intentions, to the more primitive days when he was treated as a chattel.'\nWe are warned that the system must not 'degenerate into a star chamber proceeding with the judge imposing his own particular brand of culture and morals on indigent people * * *.' Judge Marion G. Woodward, letter reproduced in 18 Social Service Review 366, 368 (1944). Doctor Bovet, the Swiss psychiatrist, in his monograph for the World Health Organization, Psychiatric Aspects of Juvenile Delinquency (1951), p. 79, stated that: 'One of the most definite conclusions of this investigation is that few fields exist in which more serious coercive measures are applied, on such flimsy objective evidence, than in that of juvenile delinquency.' We are told that 'The judge as amateur psychologist, experimenting upon the unfortunate children who must appear before him, is neither an attractive nor a convincing figure.' Harvard Law Review Note, at 808.\n\n\n26\n The impact of denying fundamental procedural due process to juveniles involved in 'delinquency' charges is dramatized by the following considerations: (1) In 1965, persons under 18 accounted for about one-fifth of all arrests for serious crimes (Nat'l Crime Comm'n, Report, p. 55) and over half of all arrests for serious property offenses (id., at 56), and in the same year some 601,000 children under 18, or 2% of all children between 10 and 17, came before juvenile courts (Juvenile Court Statistics 1965, Children's Bureau Statistical Series No. 85 (1966) p. 2). About one out of nine youths will be referred to juvenile court in connection with a delinquent act (excluding traffic offenses) before he is 18 (Nat'l Crime Comm'n Report, p. 55). Cf. also Wheeler & Cottrell, Juvenile Delinquency\u2014Its Prevention and Control (Russell Sage Foundation, 1965), p. 2; Report of the President's Commission on Crime in the District of Columbia (1966) (hereinafter cited as D.C.Crime Comm'n Report), p. 773. Furthermore, most juvenile crime apparently goes undetected or not formally punished. Wheeler & Cottrell, supra, observe that '(A)lmost all youngsters have committed at least one of the petty forms of theft and vandalism in the course of their adolescence.' Id., at 28\u201429. See also Nat'l Crime Comm'n Report, p. 55, where it is stated that 'self-report studies reveal that perhaps 90 percent of all young people have committed at least one act for which they could have been brought to juvenile court.' It seems that the rate of juvenile delinquency is also steadily rising. See Nat'l Crime Comm'n Report, p. 56; Juvenile Court Statistics, supra, pp. 2\u20143. (2) In New York, where most juveniles are represented by counsel (see n. 69, infra) and substantial procedural rights are afforded (see, e.g., nn. 80, 81, 99, infra), out of a fiscal year 1965\u20141966 total of 10,755 juvenile proceedings involving boys, 2,242 weredi smissed for failure of proof at the fact-finding hearing; for girls, the figures were 306 out of a total of 1,051. New York Judicial Conference, Twelfth Annual Report, pp. 314, 316 (1967). (3) In about one-half of the States, a juvenile may be transferred to an adult penal institution after a juvenile court has found him 'delinquent' (Delinquent Children in Penal Institutions, Children's Bureau Pub. No. 415\u20141964, p. 1). (4) In some jurisdictions a juvenile may be subjected to criminal prosecution for the same offense for which he has served under a juvenile court commitment. However, the Texas procedure to this effect has recently been held unconstitutional by a federal district court judge, in a habeas corpus action. Sawyer v. Hauck, 245 F.Supp. 55 (D.C.W.D.Tex.1965). (5) In most of the States the juvenile may end in criminal court through waiver (Harvard Law Review Note, p. 793).\n\n\n27\n Malinski v.

See generally infra.\nWhile we are concerned only with procedure before the juvenile court in this case, it should be noted that to the extent that the special procedures for juveniles are thought to be justified by the\nspecial consideration and treatment afforded them, there is reason to doubt that juveniles always receive the benefits of such a quid pro quo. As to the problem and importance of special care at the adjudicatory stage, cf. nn. 14 and 26, supra.\nAs to treatment, see Nat'l Crime Comm'n Report, pp. 80, 87; D.C.Crime Comm'n Report, pp. 665\u2014676, 686\u2014687 (at p. 687 the Report refers to the District's 'bankruptcy of dispositional resources'), 692\u2014695, 700-718 (at p. 701 the Report observes that 'The Department of Public Welfare currently lacks even the rudiments of essential diagnostic and clinical services'); Wheeler & Cottrell, Juvenile Delinquency\u2014Its Prevention and Control (Russell Sage Foundation, 1965), pp. 32\u201435; Harvard Law Review Note, p. 809; Paulsen, Juvenile Courts, Family Courts, and the Poor Man, 54 Calif.L.Rev. 694, 709\u2014712 (1966); Polier, A View From the Bench (1964).

New York Times, March 23, 1967, p. 1, col. 8). The high rate of juvenile recidivism casts some doubt upon the adequacy of treatment afforded juveniles. See D.C.Crime Comm'n Report, p. 773; Nat'l Crime Comm'n Report, pp. 55, 78.\nIn fact, some courts have recently indicated that appropriate treatment is essential to the validity of juvenile custody, and therefore that a juvenile may challenge the validity of his custody on the ground that he is not in fact receiving any special treatment.

The conclusion of the Nat'l Crime Comm'n Report is similar: '(T)here is increasing evidence that the informal procedures, contrary to the original expectation, may themselves constitute a further obstacle to effective treatment of the delinquent to the extent that they engender in the child a sense of injustice provoked by seemingly all-powerful and challengeless exercise of authority by judges and probation officers.'

He appears to have centered his attention upon whethed Gerald made the phone call and used lewd words. He was impressed by the fact that Gerald was on six months' probation because he was with another boy who allegedly stole a purse\u2014a different sort of offense, sharing the feature that Gerald was 'along'. And he even referred to a report which he said was not investigated because 'there was no accusation' 'because of lack of material foundation.'\nWith respect to the possible duty of a trial court to explore alternatives to involuntary commitment in a civil proceeding, cf. Lake v. Cameron, 124 U.S.App.D.C. 264, 364 F.2d 657 (1966), which arose under statutes relating to treatment of the mentally ill.\n\n\n42\n While appellee's brief suggests that the probation officer made some investigation of Gerald's home life, etc., there is not even a claim that the judge went beyond the point stated in the text.\n\n\n43\n ARS \u00a7\u00a7 8\u2014201, 8\u2014202.\n\n\n44\n Juvenile Delinquency\u2014Its Prevention and Control (Russell Sage Foundation, 1966), p. 35.

Id., at 84. See also D.C.Crime Comm'n Report, pp. 662\u2014665. Since this 'consent decree' procedure would involve neither adjudication of delinquency nor institutionalization, nothing we say in this opinion should be construed as expressing any views with respect to such procedure. The problems of pre-adjudication treatment of juveniles, and of post-adjudication disposition, are unique to the juvenile process; hence what we hold in this opinion with regard to the procedural requirements at the adjudicatory stage has no necessary applicability to other steps of the juvenile process.\n\n\n49\n ARS \u00a7 8\u2014222, subsec. B.\n\n\n50\n Arizona's Juvenile Code does not provide for notice of any sort to be given at the commencement of the proceedings to the child or his parents.

ARS \u00a7 8\u2014224. The procedure for initiating a proceeding, as specified by the statute, seems to require that after a preliminary inquiry by the court, a determination may be made 'that formal jurisdiction should be acquired.'

The Commission observed that 'The unfairness of too much informality is * * * reflected in the inadequacy of notice to parents and juveniles about charges and hearings.' Ibid.\n\n\n53\n For application of the due process requirement of adequate notice in a criminal context, see, e.g., Cole v. State of Arkansas, 333 U.S. 196, 68 S.Ct. 514, 92 L.Ed. 644 (1948); In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 273\u2014278, 68 S.Ct. 499, 507\u2014510, 92 L.Ed. 682 (1948). For application in a civil context, see, e.g., Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965); Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Tr. Co., 339 U.S. 306, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950). Cf. also Chaloner v. Sherman, 242 U.S. 455, 37 S.Ct. 136, 61 L.Ed. 427 (1917). The Court's discussion in these cases of the right to timely and adequate notice forecloses any contention that the notice approved by the Arizona Supreme Court, or the notice actually given the Gaults, was constitutionally adequate. See also Antieau, Constitutional Rights in Juvenile Courts, 46 Cornell L.Q. 387, 395 (1961); Paulsen, Fairness to the Juvenile Offender, 41 Minn.L.Rev. 547, 557 (1957). Cf. Standards, pp. 63\u201465; Procedures and Evidence in the Juvenile Court, A Guidebook for Judges, prepared by the Advisory Council of Judges of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency (1962), pp. 9\u201423 (and see cases discussed therein).\n\n\n54\n Mrs. Gault's 'knowledge' of the charge against Gerald, and\/or the asserted failure to object, does not excuse the lack of adequate notice. Indeed, one of the purposes of notice is to clarify the issues to be considered, and as our discussion of the facts, supra, shows, even the Juvenile Court Judge was uncertain as to the precise issues determined at the two 'hearings.' Since the Gaults had no counsel and were not told of their rightto counsel, we cannot consider their failure to object to the lack of constitutionally adequate notice as a waiver of their rights. Because of our conclusion that notice given only at the first hearing is inadequate, we need not reach the question whether the Gaults ever received adequately specific notice even at the June 9 hearing, in light of the fact they were never apprised of the charge of being habitually involved in immoral matters.\n\n\n55\n For recent cases in the District of Columbia holding that there must be advice of the right to counsel, and to have counsel appointed if necessary, see, e.g., Shioutakon v. District of Columbia, 98 U.S.App.D.C 3 71, 236 F.2d 666, 60 A.L.R.2d 686 (1956); Black v. United States, 122 U.S.App.D.C. 393, 355 F.2d 104 (1965); In re Poff, 135 F.Supp. 224 (D.C.D.C.1955).

See Note, Rights and Rehabilitation in the Juvenile Courts, 67 Col.L.Rev. 281, 324\u2014327 (1967).\n\n\n65\n Nat'l Crime Comm'n Report, pp. 86\u201487. The Commission's statement of its position is very forceful:\n'The Commission believes that no single action holds more potential for achieving procedural justice for the child in the juvenile court than provision of counsel. The presence of an independent legal representative of the child, or of his parent, is the keystone of the whole structure of guarantees that a minimum system of procedural justice requires. The rights to confront one's accusers, to cross-examine witnesses, to present evidence and testimony of one's own, to be unaffected by prejudicial and unreliable evidence, to participate meaningfully in the dispositional decision, to take an appeal have substantial meaning for the overwhelming majority of persons brought before the juvenile court only if they are provided with competent lawyers who can invoke those rights effectively. The most informal and well-intentioned of judicial proceedings are technical; few adults without legal training can influence or even understand them; certainly children cannot. Papers are drawn and charges expressed in legal language. Events follow one another in a manner that appears arbitrary and confusing to the uninitiated. Decisions, unexplained, appear too official to challenge. But with lawyers come records of proceedings; records make possible appeals\nwhich, even if they do not occur, impart by their possibility a healthy atmosphere of accountability.\n'Fears have been expressed that lawyers would make juvenile court proceedings adversary. No doubt this is partly true, but it is partly desirable. Informality is often abused. The juvenile courts deal with cases in which facts are disputed and in which, therefore, rules of evidence, confrontation of witnesses, and other adversary procedures are called for. They deal with many cases involving conduct that can lead to incarceration or close supervision for long periods, and therefore juveniles often need the same safeguards that are granted to adults. And in all cases children need advocates to speak for them and guard their interests, particularly when disposition decisions are made. It is the disposition stage at which the opportunity arises to offer individualized treatment plans and in which the danger inheres that the court's coercive power will be applied without adequate knowledge of the circumstances.\n'Fears also have been expressed that the formality lawyers would bring into juvenile court would defeat the therapeutic aims of the court. But informality has no necessary connection with therapy; it is a devide that has been used to approach therapy, and it is not the only possible device. It is quite possible that in many instances lawyers, for all their commitment to formality, could do more to further therapy for their clients than can the small, overworked social staffs of the courts. * * *\n'The Commission believes it is essential that counsel be appointed by the juvenile court for those who are unable to provide their own. Experience under the prevailing systems in which children are free to seek counsel of their choice reveals how empty of meaning the right is for those typically the subjects of juvenile court proceedings. Moreover, providing counsel only when the child is sophisticated\nenough to be aware of his need and to ask for one or when he fails to waive his announced right (is) not enough, as experience in numerous jurisdictions reveals.\n'The Commission recommends:\n'COUNSEL SHOULD BE APPOINTED AS A MATTER OF COURSE WHEREVER COERCIVE ACTION IS A POSSIBILITY, WITHOUT REQUIRING ANY AFFIRMATIVE CHOICE BY CHILD OR PARENT.'\n\n\n66\n Lehman, A Juvenile's Right to Counsel in A Delinquency Hearing, 17 Juvenile Court Judge's Journal 53 (1966). In an interesting review of the 1966 edition of the Children's Bureau's 'Standards,' Rosenheim, Standards for Juvenile and Family Courts: Old Wine in a New Bottle, 1 Fam.L.Q. 25, 29 (1967), the author observes that 'The 'Standards' of 1966, just like the 'Standards' of 1954, are valuable precisely because they represent a diligent and thoughtful search for an accommodation between the aspirations of the founders of the juvenile court and the grim realities of life against which, in part, the due process of criminal and civil law offers us protection.'\n\n\n67\n These are lawyers designated, as provided by the statute, to represent minors.

Since introduction of the law guardian system in September of 1962, it is stated that attorneys are present in the great majority of cases. Harvard Law Review Note, p. 796. See New York Judicial Conference, Twelfth Annual Report, pp. 288\u2014291 (1967), for detailed statistics on representation of juveniles in New York. For the situation before 1962, see Schinitsky, The Role of the Lawyer in Children's Court, 17 The Record 10 (N.Y. City Bar Assn. 1962). In the District of Columbia, where statute and court decisions require that a lawyer be appointed if the family is unable to retain counsel, see n. 63, supra, and where the juvenile and his parents are so informed at the initial hearing, about 85% to 90% do not choose to be represented and sign a written waiver form. D.C. Crime Comm'n Report, p. 646. The Commission recommend a doption in the District of Columbia of a 'law guardian' system similar to that of New York, with more effective notification of the right to appointed counsel, in order to eliminate the problems of procedural fairness, accuracy of factfinding, and appropriateness of disposition which the absence of counsel in so many juvenile court proceedings involves.

State of Colorado, 370 U.S. 49, 82 S.Ct. 1209, 8 L.Ed.2d 325 (1962)).\n\n\n95\n The court quoted the following passage from Haley v. State of Ohio, supra, 332 U.S., at 601, 68 S.Ct., at 304:\n'But we are told that this boy was advised of his constitutional rights before he signed the confession and that, knowing them, he nevertheless confessed. That assumes, however, that a boy of fifteen, without aid of counsel, would have a full appreciation of that advice and that on the facts of this record he had a freedom of choice. We cannot indulge those assumptions. Moreover, we cannot give any weight to recitals which merely formalize constitutional requirements. Formulas of respect for constitutional safeguards cannot prevail over the facts of life which contradict them. They may not become a cloak for inquisitorial practices and make an empty form of the due process of law for which free men fought and died to obtain.'\n\n\n96\n The N.Y.Family Court Act \u00a7 744(b) provides that 'an uncorroborated confession made out of court by a respondent is not sufficient' to constitute the required 'preponderance of the evidence.'\nSee United States v. Morales, 233 F.Supp. 160 (D.C.Mont.1964), holding a confession inadmissible in proceedings under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5031 et seq.) because, i t he circumstances in which it was made, the District Court could not conclude that it 'was freely made while Morales was afforded all of the requisites of due process required in the case of a sixteen year old boy of his experience.'

The Nat'l Crime Comm'n Report concludes that 'the evidence admissible at the adjudicatory hearing should be so limited that findings are not dependent upon or influenced by hearsay, gossip, rumor, and other unreliable types of information. To minimize the danger that adjudication will be affected by inappropriate considerations, social investigation reports should not be made known to the judge in advance of adjudication.' Id., at 87 (bold face eliminated). See also Note, Rights and Rehabilitation in the Juvenile Courts, 67 Col.L.Rev. 281, 336 (1967): 'At the adjudication stage, the use of clearly incompetent evidence in order to prove the youth's involvement in the alleged misconduct * * * is not justifiable. Particularly in delinquency cases, where the issue of fact is the commission of a crime, the introduction of hearsay\u2014such as the report of a policeman who did not witness the events\u2014contravenes the purposes underlying the sixth amendment right of confrontation.'

The Harvard Law Review Note, p. 799, states that 'The result (of the infrequency of appeals due to absence of record, indigency, etc.) is that juvenile court proceedings are largely unsupervised.' The Nat'l Crime Comm'n Report observes, p. 86, that 'records make possible appeals which, even if they do not occur, impart by their possibility a healthy atmosphere of accountability.'\n\n\n1\n 'In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation * * *.'

United States, 383 U.S. 541, 86 S.Ct. 1045, 16 L.Ed.2d 84, decided at the 1965 Term, did not purport to rest on constitutional grounds.\n\n\n2\n It is appropriate to observe that, whatever the relevance the Court may suppose that this criticism has to present issues, many of the critics have asserted that the deficiencies of juvenile courts have stemmed chiefly from the inadequacy of the personnel and resources available to those courts. See, e.g., Paulsen, Kent v. United States: The Constitutional Context of Juvenile Cases, 1966 Sup.Ct.Rev. 167, 191\u2014192; Handler, The Juvenile Court and the Adversary System: Problems of Function and Form, 1965 Wis.L.Rev. 7, 46.\n\n\n3\n The statistical evidence here is incomplete, but see generally Skoler & Tenney, Attorney Representation in Juvenile Court, 4 J. Fam.Law 77. They indicate that some 91% of the juvenile court judges whom they polled favored representation by counsel in their courts. Id., at 88.\n\n\n4\n Indeed, my Brother BLACK candidly recognizes that such is apt to be the effect of today's decision, ante, p. 60. The Court itself is content merely to rely upon inapposite language from the recommendations of the Children's Bureau, plus the terms of a single statute.\n\n\n5\n The most cogent evidence of course consists of the steady rejection of these requirements by state legislatures and courts. The wide disagreement and uncertainty upon this question are also reflected in Paulsen, Kent v. United States: The Constitutional Context of Juvenile Cases, 1966 Sup.Ct.Rev. 167, 186, 191. See also Paulsen, Fairness to the Juvenile Offender, 41 Minn.L.Rev. 547, 561\u2014562; McLean, An Answer to the Challenge of Kent, 53 A.B.A.J. 456, 457; Alexander, Constitutional Rights in Juvenile Court, 46 A.B.A.J. 1206; Shears, Legal Problems Peculiar to Children's Courts, 48 A.B.A.J. 719; Siler, The Need for Defense Counsel in the Juvenile Court, 11 Crime & Delin. 45, 57\u201458. Compare Handler, The Juvenile Court and the Adversary System: Problems of Function and Form, 1965 Wis.L.Rev. 7, 32.\n\n\n6\n Estimates of the number of children in this situation brought before juvenile courts range from 26% to some 48%; variation seems chiefly a product both of the inadequacy of records and of the difficulty of categorizing precisely the conduct with which juveniles are charged. See generally Sheridan, Juveniles Who Commit Noncriminal Acts: Why Treat in a Correctional System? 31 Fed.Probation 26, 27. By any standard, the number of juveniles involved is 'considerable.' Ibid.\n\n\n7\n Id., at 28\u201430.\n\n\n1\n I find it strange that a Court so intent upon fastening an absolute right to counsel upon nonadversary juvenile proceedings has not been willing even to consider whether the Constitution requires a lawyer's help in a criminal prosecution upon a misdemeanor charge. See Winters v. Beck, 385 U.S. 907, 87 S.Ct. 207, 17 L.Ed.2d 137; DeJoseph v. Connecticut, 385 U.S. 982, 87 S.Ct. 526, 17 L.Ed.2d 443.\n\n\n2\n State v. Guild, 5 Halst. 163, 10 N.J.L. 163, 18 Am.Dec. 404.\n'Thus, also, in very modern times, a boy of ten years old was convicted on his own confession of murdering his bedfellow, there appearing in his whole behavior plain tokens of a mischievous discretion; and as the sparing this boy merely on account of his tender years might be of dangerous consequence to the public, by propagating a notion that children might commit such atrocious crimes with impunity, it was unanimously agreed by all the judges that he was a proper subject of capital punishment.' 4 Blackstone, stone, Commentaries 23 (Wendell ed. 1847).\n\n\n3\n Until June 13, 1966, it was clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's ban upon the use of a coerced confession is constitutionally quite a different thing from the Fifth Amendment's testimonal privilege against self-incrimination. See, for example, the Court's unanimous opinion in Brown v. State of Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278, at 285\u2014286, 56 S.Ct. 461, 464\u2014465, 80 L.Ed. 682, written by Chief Justice Hughes and joined by such distinguished members of this Court as Mr. Justice Brandeis, Mr. Justice Stone, and Mr. Justice Cardozo. See also Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott, 382 U.S. 406, 86 S.Ct. 459, 15 L.Ed.2d 453, decided January 19, 1966, where the Court emphasized the 'contrast' between 'the wrongful use of a coerced confession' and 'the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination'. 382 U.S., at 416, 86 S.Ct., at 465. The complete confusion of these separate constitutional doctrines in Part V of the Court's opinion today stems, no doubt, from Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, a decision which I continue to believe was constitutionally erroneous.\n\n\n","label":1}

Abe LAVINE, etc., et al.\nNos. 74\u2014453, 74\u20145054.\nArgued March 26, 1975.\nDecided May 19, 1975.\n\nSyllabus\nPetitioners in No. 74\u20145054 brought class actions in two District Courts challenging New York's 'lodger' regulations, which require a pro-rata reduction in shelter allowance of a family receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) solely because a parent allows a nonlegally responsible person to reside in the home. Petitioners claimed that the state regulations conflicted with a provision of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 606(a), which in relevant part defines a dependent child as one 'who has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home, or physical or mental incapacity of a parent,' and an implementing regulation, 45 CFR \u00a7 233.90(a), which provides that in determining a child's financial eligibility and the amount of the assistance payment 'the income only of the (legally obligated) parent . . . will be considered available . . . in the absence of proof of actual contributions.' Petitioners also contended that the state regulations were violative of due process and equal protection. Each District Court held that the New York regulations were in conflict with the federal statutory and regulatory provisions. The Court of Appeals held that there was no such conflict and reversed the judgments and remanded the cases for convention of a three-judge court to decide the constitutional challenges. That court sustained petitioners' due process claim. This Court noted probable jurisdiction of the appeal from the three-judge court holding (No. 74\u2014453) and granted certiorari in the case of the judgment of the Court of Appeals (No. 74\u20145054). Held: The New York 'lodger' regulations, which are based on the assumption that the nonpaying lodger is contributing to the welfare of the household, without inquiry into whether he in fact does so, violate the Social Security Act and implementing regulations. Pp. 344-348.\n(a) A State is barred from assuming that nonlegally responsible persons will apply their resources to aid the welfare child, King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118; Lewis v. Martin, 397 U.S. 552, 90 S.Ct. 1282, 25 L.Ed.2d 561, yet under the New York regulations the nonpaying lodger's mere presence results in a decrease in benefits though he may contribute nothing to the needy child. Pp. 346-347.\n(b) The New York regulations cannot be justified on the ground that the lodger's presence establishes the existence of excess space because if that were so the allowance would remain reduced after the lodger leaves, which is not the case. P. 347.\n(c) The regulations do not prohibit lodgers from living in welfare homes and therefore cannot be justified on the ground that they are designed to prevent lodgers (who are ineligible for welfare) from receiving welfare benefits. Pp. 347-348.\nNo. 74\u2014453, 380 F.Supp. 167, vacated and remanded; No. 74 5054, 497 F.2d 1208, reversed.\nJudith A. Gordon for appellants in No. 74\u2014453 and respondents in No. 74\u20145054.\nMartin A. Schwartz for appellees in No. 74\u2014453 and petitioners in No. 74\u20145054.\nMr. Justice BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe question presented is whether New York regulations reducing pro rata the shelter allowance provided recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) to the extent there are nonpaying lodgers living in the household conflict with the Social Security Act and federal regulations. We conclude that the state provisions conflict with federal law and are therefore invalid. King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118 (1968); Lewis v. Martin, 397 U.S. 552, 90 S.Ct. 1282, 25 L.Ed.2d 561 (1970); Townsend v. Swank, 404 U.S. 282, 92 S.Ct. 502, 30 L.Ed.2d 448 (1971).\n\n\n2\n* AFDC is a categorical public assistance program established by the Social Security At of 1935. Its operation has been described in several recent opinions. See, e.g., Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U.S. 397, 408, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 1215, 25 L.Ed.2d 442 (1970); King v. Smith, supra, 392 U.S. at 313, 88 S.Ct. at 2131. AFDC provides federal funds to States on a matching funds basis to aid the 'needy child . . . who has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home, or physical or mental incapacity of a parent, and who is living with' any of the several listed relatives. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 606(a). States that seek to qualify for federal AFDC funding must operate a program not in conflict with the Social Security Act. Townsend v. Swank, supra, 404 U.S. at 286, 92 S.Ct., at 505.\n\n\n3\nEach of the petitioners in No. 74\u20145054 receives AFDC on behalf of herself and her minor children. This includes a shelter allowance computed as an item of need separate from other necessities such as food and clothing. N.Y.Soc.Serv.Law \u00a7 131\u2014a. Each petitioner's shelter allowance was reduced by New York officials because she allowed a person not a recipient of AFDC and who had no legal obligation to support her family to reside in the household.1 The reduction was authorized by New York regulations which provide:\n\n\n4\n'18 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 352.31: '(a) For applicant or recipient.\n\n\n5\n'(3) When a female applicant or recipient is living with a      man to whom she is not married, other than on an occasional      or transient basis, his available income and resources shall      be applied in accordance with the following:\n\n\n6\n'(iv) When the man is unwilling to assume responsibility for      the woman or her children, and there are no children of which      he is the acknowledged or adjudicated father, he shall be      treated as a lodger in accordance with section 352.30(d).'2\n\n\n7\n'18 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 352.30:\n\n\n8\n'352.30 Persons included inthe budget.\n\n\n9\n'(d) A non-legally responsible relative or unrelated person      in the household, who is not applying for nor receiving      public assistance shall not be included in the budget and      shall be deemed to be a lodger or boarding lodger. The amount which the lodger or      boarding lodger pays shall be verified and treated as income      to the family. For the lodger, the amount in excess of $15      per month shall be considered as income; for such boarding      lodgers, the amount in excess of $60 per month shall be      considered as income. In the event a lodger does not      contribute at least $15 per month, the family's shelter      allowance including fuel for heating, shall be a pro rata      share of the regular shelter allowance.' (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n10\nNo lodger of any petitioner contributed $15 a month, and pursuant to the italicized sentence, each petitioner's shelter allowance was therefore reduced by a pro rata share. For example, the shelter allowance of $150 monthly being paid to a family of four was reduced to $120 after the lodger moved in.\n\n\n11\nPetitioners challenged the New York regulations in separate actions in two Federal District Courts.3 They alleged that in making the presence of the lodger a basis for assuming the availability of income, the regulations were invalid for conflict with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 606(a), supra, and the following regulation, 45 CFR \u00a7 233.90(a) (1974), that implements that statute:\n\n\n12\n'A State plan under title IV\u2014A of the Social Security Act (relating to the AFDC program) must provide that      the determination whether a child has been deprived of      parental support or care by reason of the death, continued      absence from the home, or physical or mental incapacity of a      parent, or (if the State plan includes such cases) the      unemployment of his father, will be made only in relation to      the child's natural or adoptive parent, or in relation to the      child's stepparent who is ceremonially married to the child's      natural or adoptive parent and is legally obligated to      support the child under State law of general applicability      which requires stepparents to support stepchildren to the      same extend (sic) that natural or adoptive parents are      required to support their children. Under this requirement,      the inclusion in the family, or the presence in the home, of      a 'substitute parent' or 'man-in-the-house' or any individual      other than one described in this paragraph is not an      acceptable basis for a finding of ineligibility or for      assuming the availability of income by the State. In      establishing financial eligibility and the amount of the      assistance payment, only such net income as is actually      available for current use on a regular basis will be      considered, and the income only of the parent described in      the first sentence of this paragraph will be considered      available for children in the household in the absence of      proof of actual contributions.' (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n13\nWithout reaching the recipients' constitutional challenges denial of due process and equal protection, and infringement of rights of privacy and free association\u2014each District Court adjudged the state regulations to be invalid for conflict with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 606(a) and 45 CFR \u00a7 233.90(a), supra, and granted declaratory and injunctive relief.4 Both judgments were appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Court of Appeals held that the New York rules were not in conflict with federal law, reversed the judgments, and remanded for convention of a three-judge court to decide the constitutional challenges. Taylor v. Lavine, 497 F.2d 1208 (1974). The three-judge court that was convened sustained the due process challenge to the New York rules. 380 F.Supp. 167 (ED & SDNY 1974). We noted probable jurisdiction of appellants' appeal from the three-judge court holding, 419 U.S. 1045, 95 S.Ct. 617, 42 L.Ed.2d 638 (1974) (No. 74\u2014453), and also granted certiorari to the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 419 U.S. 1103, 95 S.Ct. 773, 42 L.Ed.2d 799 (1974) (No. 74\u20145054). We hold that the Court of Appeals erred in No. 74\u20145054 and reverse. Since in that circumstance we need not address the constitutional decision in No. 74\u2014453, we vacate the judgment in that case and remand with directions to dismiss as moot. Cf. United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 71 S.Ct. 104, 95 L.Ed. 36 (1950).\n\nII\n\n14\nTitle 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 606(a) was previously construed in King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118 (1968). That case involved an Alabama 'substitute father' regulation, which denied AFDC benefits to children of a mother who cohabited in or outside her home with an able-bodied man. It was irrelevant under the state regulation whether the man was legally obligated to support the children or whether he did in fact contribute to their support. Alabama contended that its rule simply defined nonabsent 'parent' under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 606(a). The regulation was claimed to be justified as having the purpose of discouraging illicit sexual relationships and of putting 'informal' families on a par with ordinary families. We concluded that this was an insufficient justification, holding that it is 'inconceivable . . . that Alabama is free to discourage immorality and illegitimacy by the device of absolutedisqualification of needy children.' King v. Smith, supra, at 326, 88 S.Ct., at 2138. For, in light of the purpose of AFDC to aid needy children, we held, on the statutory language and legislative history, that the term 'parent' in \u00a7 606(a) must be read to include 'only those persons with a legal duty of support.' 392 U.S., at 327, 88 S.Ct., at 2138. A broader definition would fail to provide the economic security for needy children which was Congress' primary goal. Id., at 329\u2014330, 88 S.Ct., at 2139\u20142140. Thus the Alabama regulation was invalid because its definition of 'parent' conflicted with that of the Social Security Act. Id., at 333, 88 S.Ct., at 2141.\n\n\n15\nThe Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) codified the holding of King v. Smith in 45 CFR \u00a7 233.90(a), supra, the regulation at issue in the instant case.5 Its key provision specifies that in determining a child's financial eligibility and the amount of the assistance payment, 'the income only of the (legally obligated) parent . . . will be considered available . . . in the absence of proof of actual contributions.' 45 CFR \u00a7 233.90(a). We applied this regulation in Lewis v. Martin, 397 U.S. 552, 90 S.Ct. 1282, 25 L.Ed.2d 561 (1970). Lewis presented the question of the validity of a California rule which provided that in computing payments to needy children who lived with their mother and stepfather or 'an adult male person assuming the role of spouse' (MARS), consideration should be given to the income of the stepfather or MARS. Id., at 554, 90 S.Ct., at 1283. We held the California rule invalid as in conflict with the Social Security Act, the HEW regulation, 45 CFR \u00a7 233.90(a), and King v. Smith, supra. We said that '(i)n the absence of proof of actual contribution, California may not consider the child's 'resources' to include either the income of a nonadopting stepfather who is not legally obligated to support the child as is a natural parent, or the income of a MARS whatever the nature of his obligation to support.' 397 U.S., at 559\u2014560, 90 S.Ct., at 1286. In short, we held that the Social Security Act precludes treating a person who is not a natural or adoptive parent as a breadwinner 'unless the bread is actually set on the table.' Id., at 559, 90 S.Ct., at 1286.\n\nIII\n\n16\nThus the New York regulations at issue are also invalid. This is clearly so insofar as they are based on the assumption that the nonpaying lodger is contributing to the welfare houselhold, without inquiry into whether he in fact does so. Section 352.31(a)(3), supra, provides that '(w)hen a . . . recipient is living with a man to whom she is not married . . . his available income and resources shall be applied in accordance with the following . . . (iv) . . . he shall be treated as a lodger in accordance with section 352.30(d).' (Emphasis supplied.) Plainly treating some one as a lodger is an impermissible means of 'applying available income and resources.' Under \u00a7 352.30(d), supra, when a lodger pays less than $15 a month, the family's shelter allowance is reduced pro rata. Respondents themselves concede in this Court that the regulations are designed so that the lodger will not 'be excused from providing his share of shelter cost.' Brief for Respondents in Opposition to Pet. for Cert. 9.\n\n\n17\nThus under the New York regulations the nonpaying lodger's mere presence results in a decrease in benefits. Yet the lodger, like the Alabama 'substitute father' or the California 'MARS,' may be contributing nothing to the needy child. King v. Smith, supra, and Lewis v. Martin, supra, construe the federal law and regulations as barring the States from assuming that nonlegally responsible persons will apply their resources to aid the welfare child. Those cases therefore compel a reversal of the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n18\nRespondents argue, however, that in any event the New York regulations may be justified on other grounds. They argue first that the presence of the lodger is evidence that the AFDC family has excess room and therefore that its shelter allowance exceeds its needs. That, however, is not how the New York regulations are applied. When a nonpaying lodger moves in, the shelter allowance is reduced pro rata with no regard to space considerations. When the lodger moves out the allowance is returned to its original amount. That practice clearly reveals that the existence of excess space is not the basis of the reduction, because otherwise the allowance would remain reduced after the lodger leaves. Thus, the fact that the allowance varies with the lodger's presence demonstrates that it is keyed, as the regulations plainly imply, to the impermissible assumption that the lodger is contributing income to the family.6\n\n\n19\nAnother, somewhat related, justification asserted is that the shelter allowance is reduced to prevent lodgers, who by definition are ineligible for welfare, from receiving welfare benefits. The regulations, however, do not prohibit lodgers from living in welfare homes. The lodger may stay on after the allowance is reduced, and the State takes no further action.7 The only victim of the state regulations is thus the needy child who suffers reduced benefits. But States may not seek to accomplish policies aimed at lodgers by depriving needy children of benefits. King v. Smith, supra, 392 U.S., at 326, 88 S.Ct., at 2138; Lewis v. Martin, supra.\n\n\n20\nThe judgment in No. 74\u20145054 is reversed and the judgment in No. 74\u2014453 is vacated and remanded with directions to dismiss as moot.\n\n\n21\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n22\nJudgment of Court of Appeals reversed; judgment of Three-Judge Court vacated and remanded.\n\n\n23\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting.\n\n\n24\nI do not think that the New York nonpaying-lodgers regulation is in conflict with federal statutory law, for the reasons stated by Judge Hays in his opinion for the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Taylor v. Lavine, 497 F.2d 1208, 1974). I therefore reach the constitutional issues presented in No. 74\u2014453, and conclude that the regulation is not constitutionally impermissible, for the reasons set forth by Judge Hays in his dissenting opinion in Hurley v. Van Lare, 380 F.Supp. 167, 177 (ED & SDNY 1974). I would thus affirm in No. 74\u20145054 and reverse in No. 74\u2014453.\n\n\n\n1\n Petitioner Hurley's lodger was an unrelated male friend, petitioner Taylor's was her sister, and petitioner Otey's was her 23-year-old son.\n\n\n2\n Effective July 26, 1974, after the Court of Appeals decision in No. 74\u20145054, \u00a7 352.31(a)(3) was amended to provide:\n'(3) When an applicant or recipient is living, other than on an occasional or transient basis, with a person to whom such applicant or recipient is not married, the available income and resources of such person shall be applied in accordance with the following:\n'(iv) When the person is unwilling to assume responsibility for the applicant or recipient or his or her children and there are no children for whom such person is legally responsible, such person shall be treated as a lodger in accordance with subdivision (d) of section 352.30 of this Part.'\nEven prior to this amendment, the pro rata reduction in shelter allowance was applied without regard to the gender of the nonpaying lodger. See n. 1, supra. This was apparently because the reductions were pursuant to 18 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7 352.30(d), which makes no reference to gender.\n\n\n3\n Petitioner Hurley's action was brought in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. Hurley v. Van Lare, 72 Civ. 3423. Petitioners Taylor and Otey brought their action in the Eastern District of New York. Taylor v. Lavine, 73 Civ. 699. Each District Court certified class action status for the case before it, the class consisting of 'all residents of the State of New York who are or were or will be receiving public assistance, and who have had their grants of public assistance reduced, terminated, suspended or denied, or who are or may be threatened with reduction, termination, suspension, or denial of public assistance, solely because of the presence of a noncontributing lodger in the home pursuant to 18 NYCRR \u00a7\u00a7 352.31(a)(3)(iv) and 352.30(d).' App. 99, 144.\n\n\n4\n Hurley v. Van Lare, 365 F.Supp. 186 (SDNY 1973). The opinion of the District Judge in Taylor v. Lavine, supra, is unreported.\n\n\n5\n As originally phrased, the regulation was numbered 45 CFR \u00a7 203.1. See Lewis v. Martin, 397 U.S. 552, 556, 90 S.Ct. 1282, 1284, 25 L.Ed.2d 561 (1970).\n\n\n6\n Indeed it would seem implausible to assume that the presence of a lodger establishes beyond peradventure the existence of excess space. A lodger might simply be sleeping on the couch in an already overcrowded apartment.\n\n\n7\n 'Proration of the shelter allowance lowers the amount of money available to the welfare family, but it does not prevent the family from providing its lodger with free living space by diverting part of its basic grant to pay the rent. . . . (T)here is evidence that poor families often find the presence of a lodger worth a sacrifice in income.'

ALFORD.\nNo. 14.\nArgued Nov. 17, 1969.\nReargued Oct. 14, 1970.\nDecided Nov. 23, 1970.\n\nSyllabus\nAppellee was indicted for the capital crime of first-degree murder. At that time North Carolina law provided for the penalty of life imprisonment when a plea of guilty was accepted to a first-degree murder charge; for the death penalty following a jury verdict of guilty, unless the jury recommended life imprisonment; and for a penalty of from two to 30 years' imprisonment for second-degree murder. Appellee's attorney, in the face of strong evidence of guilt, recommended a guilty plea, but left the decision to appellee. The prosecutor agreed to accept a plea of guilty to second-degree murder. The trial court heard damaging evidence from certain witnesses before accepting a plea. Appellee pleaded guilty, although disclaiming guilt, because of the threat of the death penalty, and was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment. The Court of Appeals, on an appeal from a denial of a writ of habeas corpus, found that appellee's guilty plea was involuntary because it was motivated principally by fear of the death penalty. Held: The trial judge did not commit constitutional error in accepting appellee's guilty plea. Pp. 31-39.\n(a) A guilty plea that represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternatives available to a defendant, especially one represented by competent counsel, is not compelled within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment because it was entered to avoid the possibility of the death penalty. Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747. Pp. 31-39.\n(b) Hudson v. United States, 272 U.S. 451, 47 S.Ct. 127, 71 L.Ed. 347, which held that a federal court may impose a prison sentence after accepting a plea of nolo contendere, implicitly recognized that there is no constitutional bar to imposing a prison sentence upon an accused who is unwilling to admit guilt but who is willing to waive trial and accept the sentence. Pp. 35-36.\n(c) An accused may voluntarily, knowingly, and understandingly consent to the imposition of a prison sentence even though he is unwilling to admit participation in the crime, or even if his guilty plea contains a protestation of innocence, when, as here, he intelligently concludes that his interests require a guilty plea and the record strongly evidences guilt. Pp. 37-38.\n(d) The Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights do not prohibit the States from accepting pleas to lesser-in-cluded offenses. P. 39.\n405 F.2d 340, vacated and remanded.\nJacob L. Safron, Raleigh, N.C., for appellant.\nDoris R. Bray, Greensboro, N.C., for appellee.\nMr. Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nOn December 2, 1963, Alford was indicted for first-degree murder, a capital offense under North Carolina law.1 The court appointed an attorney to represent him, and this attorney questioned all but one of the various witnesses who appellee said would substantiate his claim of innocence. The witnesses, however, did not support Alford's story but gave statements that strongly indicated his guilt. Faced with strong evidence of guilt and no substantial evidentiary support for the claim of innocence. Alford's attorney recommended that he plead guilty, but left the ultimate decision to Alford himself. The prosecutor agreed to accept a plea of guilty to a charge of second-degree murder, and on December 10, 1963, Alford pleaded guilty to the reduced charge.\n\n\n2\nBefore the plea was finally accepted by the trial court, the court heard the sworn testimony of a police officer who summarized the State's case. Two other witnesses besides Alford were also heard. Although there was no eyewitness to the crime, the testimony indicated that shortly before the killing Alford took his gun from his house, stated his intention to kill the victim, and returned home with the declaration that he had carrier out the killing. After the summary presentation of the State's case, Alford took the stand and testified that he had not committed the murder but that he was pleading guilty because he faced the threat of the death penalty if he did not do so.2 In response to the questions of his counsel, he acknowledged that his counsel had informed him of the difference between second- and first-degree murder and of his rights in case he chose to go to trial.3 The trial court then asked appellee if, in light of his denial of guilt, he still desired to plead guilty to second-degree murder and appellee answered, 'Yes, sir. I plead guilty on\u2014from the circumstances that he (Alford's attorney) told me.' After eliciting information about Alford's prior criminal record, which was a long one,4 the trial court sentenced him to 30 years' imprisonment, the maximum penalty for second-degree murder.5\n\n\n3\nAlford sought post-conviction relief in the state court. Among the claims raised was the claim that his plea of guilty was invalid because it was the product of fear and coercion. After a hearing, the state court in 1965 found that the plea was 'willingly, knowingly, and understandingly' made on the advice of competent counsel and in the face of a strong prosecution case. Subsequently, Alford petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, first in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, and then in the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Both courts denied the writ on the basis of the state court's findings that Alford voluntarily and knowingly agreed to plead guilty. In 1967, Alford again petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. That court, without an evidentiary hearing, again denied relief on the grounds that the guilty plea was voluntary and waived all defenses and nonjurisdictional defects in any prior stage of the proceedings and that the findings of the state court in 1965 clearly required rejection of Alford's claim that that he was denied effective assistance of counsel prior to pleading guilty. On appeal, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed on the ground that Alford's guilty plea was made involuntarily. 405 F.2d 340 (1968). In reaching its conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied heavily on United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570, 88 S.Ct. 1209, 20 L.Ed.2d 138 (1968), which the court read to require invalidation of the North Carolina statutory framework for the imposition of the death penalty because North Carolina statutes encouraged defendants to waive constitutional rights by the promise of no more than life imprisonment if a guilty plea was offered and accepted. Conceding that Jackson did not require the automatic invalidation of pleas of guilty entered under the North Carolina statutes, the Court of Appeals ruled that Alford's guilty plea was involuntary because its principal motivation was fear of the death penalty. By this standard, even if both the judge and the jury had possessed the power to impose the death penalty for first-degree murder or if guilty pleas to capital charges had not been permitted, Alford's plea of guilty to second-degree murder should still have been rejected because impermissibly induced by his desire to eliminate the possibility of a death sentence.6 We noted probable jurisdiction. 394 U.S. 956, 89 S.Ct. 1306, 22 L.Ed.2d 558 (1969). We vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings.\n\n\n4\nWe held in Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970), that a plea of guilty which would not have been entered except for the defendant's desire to avoid a possible death penalty and to limit the maximum penalty to life imprisonment or a term of years was not for that reason compelled within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. Jackson established no new test for determining the validity of guilty pleas. The standard was and remains whether the plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant. See Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 242, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1711, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969); Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 493, 82 S.Ct. 510, 513, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962); Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220, 223, 47 S.Ct. 582, 583, 71 L.Ed. 1009 (1927). That he would not have pleaded except for the opportunity to limit the possible penalty does not necessarily demonstrate that the plea of guilty was not the product of a free and rational choice, especially where the defendant was represented by competent counsel whose advice was that the plea would be to the defendant's advantage. The standard fashioned and applied by the Court of Appeals was therefore erroneous and we would, without more, vacate and remand the case for further proceedings with respect to any other claims of Alford which are properly before that court, if it were not for other circumstances appearing in the record which might seem to warrant an affirmance of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n5\nAs previously recounted after Alford's plea of guilty was offered and the State's case was placed before the judge, Alford denied that he had committed the murder but reaffirmed his desire to plead guilty to avoid a possible death sentence and to limit the penalty to the 30-year maximum provided for second-degree murder. Ordinarily, a judgment of conviction resting on a plea of guilty is justified by the defendant's admission that he committed the crime charged against him and his consent that judgment be entered without a trial of any kind. The plea usually subsumes both elements, and justifiably so, even though there is no separate, express admission by the defendant that he committed the particular acts claimed to constitute the crime charged in the indictment. See Brady v. United States, supra, 397 U.S. at 748, 90 S.Ct. at 1468; McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 1170, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969). Here Alford entered his plea but accompanied it with the statement that he had not shot the victim.\n\n\n6\nIf Alford's statements were to be credited as sincere assertions of his innocence, there obviously existed a factual and legal dispute between him and the State. Without more, it might be argued that the conviction entered on his guilty plea was invalid, since his assertion of innocence negatived any admission of guilt, which, as we observed last Term in Brady, is normally '(c) entral to the plea and the foundation for entering judgment against the defendant * * *.' 397 U.S., at 748, 90 S.Ct., at 1468.\n\n\n7\nIn addition to Alford's statement, however, the court had heard an account of the events on the night of the murder, including information from Alford's acquaintances that he had departed from his home with his gun stating his intention to kill and that he had later declared that he had carried out his intention. Nor had Alford wavered in his desire to have trial court determine his guilt without a jury trial. Although denying the charge against him, he nevertheless preferred the dispute between him and the State to be settled by the judge in the context of a guilty plea proceeding rather than by a formal trial. Thereupon, with the State's telling evidence and Alford's denial before it, the trial court proceeded to convict and sentence Alford for second-degree murder.\n\n\n8\nState and lower federal courts are divided upon whether a guilty plea can be accepted when it is accompanied by protestations of innocence and hence contains only a waiver of trial but no admission of guilt. Some courts, giving expression to the principle that '(o)ur law only authorizes a conviction where guilt is shown,' Harris v. State, 76 Tex.Cr.R. 126, 131, 172 S.W. 975, 977 (1915), require that trial judges reject such pleas. See, e.g., Hulsey v. United States, 369 F.2d 284, 287 (CA5 1966); United States ex rel. Elksnis v. Gilligan, 256 F.Supp. 244, 255 257 (SDNY 1966); People v. Morrison, 348 Mich. 88, 81 N.W.2d 667 (1957); State v. Reali, 26 N.J. 222, 139 A.2d 300 (1958); State v. Leyba, 80 N.M. 190, 193, 453 P.2d 211, 214 (1969); State v. Stacy, 43 Wash.2d 358, 361\u2014364, 261 P.2d 400, 402\u2014403 (1953). But others have concluded that they should not 'force any defense on a defendant in a criminal case,' particularly when advancement of the defense might 'end in disaster * * *.' Tremblay v. Overholser, 199 F.Supp. 569, 570 (DC 1961). They have argued that, since 'guilt, or the degree of guilt, is at times uncertain and elusive,' '(a)n accused, though believing in or entertaining doubts respecting his innocence, might reasonably conclude a jury would be convinced of his guilt and that he would fare better in the sentence by pleading guilty * * *.' McCoy v. United States, 124 U.S.App.D.C. 177, 179, 363 F.2d 306, 308 (1966). As one state court observed nearly a century ago, '(r)easons other than the fact that he is guilty may induce a defendant to so plead, * * * (and) (h)e must be permitted to judge for himself in this respect.' State v. Kaufman, 51 Iowa 578, 580, 2 N.W. 275, 276 (1879) (dictum). Accord, e.g., Griffin v. United States, 132 U.S.App.D.C. 108, 405 F.2d 1378 (1968); Bruce v. United States, 126 U.S.App.D.C. 336, 342\u2014343, 379 F.2d 113, 119\u2014120 (1967); City of Burbank v. General Electric Co., 329 F.2d 825, 835 (CA9 1964) (dictum); State v. Martinez, 89 Idaho 129 138, 403 P.2d 597, 602\u2014603 (1965); People v. Hetherington, 379 Ill. 71, 39 N.E.2d 361 (1942); State ex rel. Crossley v. Tahash, 263 Minn. 299, 307\u2014308, 116 N.W.2d 666, 672 (1962); Commonwealth v. Cottrell, 433 Pa. 177, 249 A.2d 294 (1969). Cf. United States ex rel. Brown v. LaVallee, 424 F.2d 457 (CA2 1970).7\n\n\n9\nThis Court has not confronted this precise issue, but prior decisions do yield relevant principles. In Lynch v. Overholser, 369 U.S. 705, 82 S.Ct. 1063, 8 L.Ed.2d 211 (1962), Lynch, who had been charged in the Municipal Court of the District of Columbia with drawing and negotiating bad checks, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of one year in jail, sought to enter a plea of guilty, but the trial judge refused to accept the plea since a psychiatric report in the judge's possession indicated that Lynch had been suffering from 'a manic depressive psychosis, at the time of the crime charged,' and hence might have been not guilty by reason of insanity. Although at the subsequent trial Lynch did not rely on the insanity defense, he was found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed for an indeterminate period to a mental institution. On habeas corpus, the Court ordered his release, construing the congressional legislation seemingly authorizing the commitment as not reaching a case where the accused preferred a guilty plea to a plea of insanity. The Court expressly refused to rule that Lynch had an absolute right to have his guilty plea accepted, see id., at 719, 82 S.Ct. at 1072, but implied that there would have been no constitutional error had his plea been accepted even though evidence before the judge indicated that there was a valid defense.\n\n\n10\nThe issue in Hudson v. United States, 272 U.S. 451, 47 S.Ct. 127, 71 L.Ed. 347 (1926), was whether a federal court has power to impose a prison sentence after accepting a plea of nolo contendere, a plea by which a defendant does not expressly admit his guilt, but nonetheless waives his right to a trial and authorizes the court for purposes of the case to treat him as if he were guilty.8 The Court held that a trial court does have such power, and except for the cases which were rejected in Hudson,9 the federal courts have uniformly followed this rule, even in cases involving moral turpitude. Bruce v. United States, supra, 126 U.S.App.D.C., at 343 n. 20, 379 F.2d, at 120 n. 20 (dictum). See, e.g., Lott v. United States, 367 U.S. 421, 81 S.Ct. 1563, 6 L.Ed.2d 940 (1961) (fraudulent evasion of income tax); Sullivan v. United States, 348 U.S. 170, 75 S.Ct. 182, 99 L.Ed. 210 (1954) (ibid.); Farnsworth v. Zerbst, 98 F.2d 541 (CA5 1938) (espionage); Pharr v. United States, 48 F.2d 767 (CA6 1931) (misapplication of bank funds); United States v. Bagliore, 182 F.Supp. 714 (EDNY 1960) (receiving stolen property). Implicit in the nolo contendere cases is a recognition that the Constitution does not bar imposition of a prison sentence upon an accused who is unwilling expressly to admit his guilt but who, faced with grim alternatives, is willing to waive his trial and accept the sentence.\n\n\n11\nThese cases would be directly in point if Alford had simply insisted on his plea but refused to admit the crime. The fact that his plea was denominated a plea of guilty rather than a plea of nolo contendere is of no constitutional significance with respect to the issue now before us, for the Constitution is concerned with the practical consequences, not the formal categorizations, of state law. See Smith v. Bennett, 365 U.S. 708, 712, 81 S.Ct. 895, 897, 6 L.Ed.2d 39 (1961); Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 266, 80 S.Ct. 725, 733, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960). Cf. Kermarec v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 358 U.S. 625, 630\u2014632, 79 S.Ct. 406, 409\u2014411, 3 L.Ed.2d 550 (1959). Thus, while most pleas of guilty consist of both a waiver of trial and an express admission of guilt, the latter element is not a constitutional requisite to the imposition of criminal penalty. An individual accused of crime may voluntarily, knowingly, and understandingly consent to the imposition of a prison sentence even if he is unwilling or unable to admit his participation in the acts constituting the crime.\n\n\n12\nNor can we perceive any material difference between a plea that refuses to admit commission of the criminal act and a plea containing a protestation of innocence when, as in the instant case, a defendant intelligently concludes that his interests require entry of a guilty plea and the record before the judge contains strong evidence of actual guilt. Here the State had a strong case of first-degree murder against Alford. Whether he realized or disbelieved his guilt, he insisted on his plea because in his view he had absolutely nothing to gain by a trial and much to gain by pleading. Because of the overwhelming evidence against him, a trial was precisely what neither Alford nor his attorney desired. Confronted with the choice between a trial for first-degree murder, on the one hand, and a plea of guilty to second-degree murder, on the other, Alford quite reasonably chose the latter and thereby limited the maximum penalty to a 30-year term. When his plea is viewed in light of the evidence against him, which substantially negated his claim of innocence and which further provided a means by which the judge could test whether the plea was being intelligently entered, see McCarthy v. United States, supra, 394 U.S., at 466\u2014467, 89 S.Ct., at 1170\u20141171 (1969),10 its validity cannot be seriously questioned. In view of the strong factual basis for the plea demonstrated by the State and Alford's clearly expressed desire to enter it despite his professed belief in his innocence, we hold that the trial judge did not commit constitutional error in accepting it.11\n\n\n13\nRelying on United States v. Jackson, supra, Alford now argues in effect that the State should not have allowed him this choice but should have insisted on proving him guilty of murder in the first degree. The States in their wisdom may take this course by statute or otherwise and may prohibit the practice of accepting pleas to lesser included offenses under any circumstances.12 But this is not the mandate of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights. The prohibitions against involuntary or unintelligent pleas should not be relaxed, but neither should an exercise in arid logic render those constitutional guarantees counterproductive and put in jeopardy the very human values they were meant to preserve.\n\n\n14\nThe Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit was in error to find Alford's plea of guilty invalid because it was made to avoid the possibility of the death penalty. That court's judgment directing the issuance of the writ of habeas corpus is vacated and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n15\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n16\nVacated and remanded.\n\n\n17\nMr. Justice BLACK, while adhering to his belief that United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570, 88 S.Ct. 1209, 20 L.Ed.2d 138, was wrongly decided, concurs in the judgment and in substantially all of the opinion in this case.\n\n\n18\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting.\n\n\n19\nLast Term, this Court held, over my dissent, that a plea of guilty may validly be induced by an unconstitutional threat to subject the defendant to the risk to death, so long as the plea is entered in open court and the defendant is represented by competent counsel who is aware of the threat, albeit not of its unconstitutionality. Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 745 758, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 1467\u20141474, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970); Parker v. North Carolina, 397 U.S. 790, 795, 90 S.Ct. 1458, 1461, 25 L.Ed.2d 785 (1970). Today the Court makes clear that its previous holding was intended to apply even when the record demonstrates that the actual effect of the unconstitutional threat was to induce a guilty plea from a defendant who was unwilling to admit his guilt.\n\n\n20\nI adhere to the view that, in any given case, the influence of such an unconstitutional threat 'must necessarily be given weight in determining the voluntariness of a plea.' Parker v. North Carolina, 397 U.S. at 805, 90 S.Ct., at 1458 (dissent). And, without reaching the question whether due process permits the entry of judgment upon a plea of guilty accompanied by a contemporaneous denial of acts constituting the crime,1 I believe that at the very least such a denial of guilt is also a relevant factor in determining whether the plea was voluntarily and intelligently made. With these factors in mind, it is sufficient in my view to state that the facts set out in the majority opinion demonstrate that Alford was 'so gripped by fear of the death penalty'2 that his decision to plead guilty was not voluntary but was 'the product of duress as much so as choice reflecting physical constraint.' Haley v. Ohio, 332 U.S. 596, 606, 68 S.Ct. 302, 307, 92 L.Ed. 224 (1948) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.). Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n\n1\n Under North Carolina law, first-degree murder is punished with death unless the jury recommends that the punishment shall be life imprisonment:\n'A murder which shall be perpetrated by means of poison, lying in wait, imprisonment, starving, torture, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing, or which shall be committed in the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any arson, rape, robbery, burglary or other felony, shall be deemed to be murder in the first degree and shall be punished with death: Provided, if at the time of rendering its verdict in open court, the jury shall so recommend, the punishment shall be imprisonment for life in the State's prison, and the court shall so instruct the jury. All other kinds of murder shall be deemed murder in the second degree, and shall be punished with imprisonment of not less than two nor more than thirty years in the State's prison.' N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14\u201417 (1969).\nAt the time Alford pleaded guilty, North Carolina law provided that if a guilty plea to a charge of first-degree murder was accepted by the prosecution and the court, the penalty would be life imprisonment rather than death. The provision permitting guilty pleas in capital cases was repealed in 1969. See Parker v. North Carolina, 397 U.S. 790, 792\u2014795, 90 S.Ct. 1458, 1460\u20141461, 25 L.Ed.2d 785 (1970). Though under present North Carolina law it is not possible for a defendant to plead guilty to a capital charge, it seemingly remains possible for a person charged with a capital offense to plead guilty to a lesser charge.\n\n\n2\n After giving his version of the events of the night of the murder, Alford stated:\n'I pleaded guilty on second degree murder because they said there is too much evidence, but I ain't shot no man, but I take the fault for the other man. We never had an argument in our life and I just pleaded guilty because they said if I didn't they would gas no for it, and that is all.'\nIn response to questions from his attorney, Alford affirmed that he had consulted several times with his attorney and with members of his family and had been informed of his rights if he chose to plead not guilty. Alford then reaffirmed his decision to plead guilty to second-degree murder:\n'Q. (by Alford's attorney). And you authorized me to tender a plea of guilty to second degree murder before the court?\n'A. Yes, sir.\n'Q. And in doing that, that you have again affirmed your decision on that point?\n'A. Well, I'm still pleading that you all got me to plead guilty. I plead the other way, circumstantial evidence; that the jury will prosecute me on\u2014on the second. You told me to plead guilty, right. I don't\u2014I'm not guilty but I plead guilty.'\n\n\n3\n At the state court hearing on post-conviction relief, the testimony confirmed that Alford had been fully informed by his attorney as to his rights on a plea of not guilty and as to the consequences of a plea of guilty. Since the record in this case affirmatively indicates that Alford was aware of the consequences of his plea of guilty and of the rights waived by the plea, no issues of substance under Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969), would be presented even if that case was held applicable to the events here in question.\n\n\n4\n Before Alford was sentenced, the trial judge asked Alford about prior convictions. Alford answered that, among other things, he had served six years of a ten-year sentence for murder, had been convicted nine times for armed robbery, and had been convicted for transporting stolen goods, forgery, and carrying a concealed weapon. App. 9\u201411.\n\n\n5\n See n. 1, supra.\n\n\n6\n Thus if Alford had entered the same plea in the same way in 1969 after the statute authorizing guilty pleas to capital charges had been repealed, see n. 1, supra, the result reached by the Court of Appeals should have been the same under that court's reasoning.\n\n\n7\n A third approach has been to decline to rule definitively that a trial judge must either accept or reject an otherwise valid plea containing a protestation of innocence, but to leave that decision to his sound discretion. See Maxwell v. United States, 368 F.2d 735, 738\u2014739 (CA9 1966).\n\n\n8\n Courts have defined the plea of nolo contendere in a variety of different ways, describing it, on the one hand, as 'in effect, a plea of guilty,' United States v. Food & Grocery Bureau, 43 F.Supp. 974, 979 (SD Cal.1942), aff'd, 139 F.2d 973 (CA9 1943), and on the other, as a query directed to the court to determine the defendant's guilt. State v. Hopkins, 27 Del. 306, 88 A. 473 (1913). See generally Lott v. United States, 367 U.S. 421, 426 427, 81 S.Ct. 1563, 1566\u20141567, 6 L.Ed.2d 940 (1961), id., 367 U.S., at 427\u2014430, 81 S.Ct. at 1567\u20141569 (Clark, J., dissenting); 21 Am.Jur.2d, Criminal Law \u00a7 497. As a result, it is impossible to state precisely what a defendant does admit when he enters a nolo plea in a way that will consistently fit all the cases.\nHudson v. United States, supra, was also ambiguous. In one place, the Court called the plea 'an admission of guilt for the purposes of the case,' id., at 455, 47 S.Ct., at 129, but in another, the Court quoted an English authority who had defined the plea as one 'where a defendant, in a case not capital, doth not directly own himself guilty * * *.' Id., at 453, 47 S.Ct., at 128, quoting 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown 466 (8th ed. 1824).\nThe plea may have originated in the early medieval practice by which defendants wishing to avoid imprisonment would seek to make an end of the matter (finem facere) by offering to pay a sum of money to the king. See 2 F. Pollock & F. Maitland, The History of English Law 517 (2d ed. 1909). An early 15th-century case indicated that a defendant did not admit his guilt when he sought such a compromise, but merely 'that he put himself on the grace of our Lord, the King, and asked that he might be allowed to pay a fine (petit se admittit per finem).' Anon., Y.B.Hil., 9 Hen. 6, f. 59, pl. 8 (1431). A 16th-century authority noted that a defendant who so pleaded 'putteth hym selfe in Gratiam Reginae without anye more, or by Protestation that hee is not guiltie * * *,' W. Lambard, Eirenarcha 427 (1581), while an 18th-century case distinguished between a nolo plea and a jury verdict of guilty, noting that in the former the defendant could introduce evidence of innocence in mitigation of punishment, whereas in the latter such evidence was precluded by the finding of actual guilt. Queen v. Templeman, 1 Salk. 55, 91 Eng.Rep. 54 (K.B.1702).\nThroughout its history, that is, the plea of nolo contendere has been viewed not as an express admission of guilt but as a consent by the defendant that he may be punished as if he were guilty and a prayer for leniency. Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 11 preserves this distinction in its requirement that a court cannot accept a guilty plea 'unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea'; there is no similar requirement for pleas of nolo contendere, since it was thought desirable to permit defendants to plead nolo without making any inquiry into their actual guilt. See Notes of Advisory Committee to Rule 11.\n\n\n9\n Blum v. United States, 196 F. 269 (CA7 1912); Shapiro v. United States, 196 F. 268 (CA7 1912); Tucker v. United States, 196 F. 260 (CA7 1912).\n\n\n10\n Because of the importance of protecting the innocent and of insuring that guilty pleas are a product of free and intelligent choice, various state and federal court decisions properly caution that pleas coupled with claims of innocence should not be accepted unless there is a factual basis for the plea, see, e.g., Griffin v. United States, 132 U.S. App.D.C. 108, 110, 405 F.2d 1378, 1380 (1968); Bruce v. United States, supra, 126 U.S.App.D.C., at 342, 379 F.2d, at 119 (1967); Commonwealth v. Cottrell, 433 Pa. 177, 249 A.2d 294 (1969); and until the judge taking the plea has inquired into and sought to resolve the conflict between the waiver of trial and the claim of innocence. See, e.g., People v. Serrano, 15 N.Y.2d 304, 308\u2014309, 258 N.Y.S.2d 386, 388\u2014389, 206 N.E.2d 330, 332 (1965); State v. Branner, 149 N.C. 559, 563, 63 S.E. 169, 171 (1908). See also Kreuter v. United States, 201 F.2d 33, 36 (CA10 1952).\nIn the federal courts, Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 11 expressly provides that a court 'shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea.'\n\n\n11\n Our holding does not mean that a trial judge must accept every constitutionally valid guilty plea merely because a defendant wishes so to plead. A criminal defendant does not have an absolute right under the Constitution to have his guilty plea accepted by the court, see Lynch v. Overholser, 369 U.S., at 719, 82 S.Ct., at 1072, 8 L.Ed.2d 211 (by implication), although the States may by statute or otherwise confer such a right. Likewise, the States may bar their courts from accepting guilty pleas from any defendants who assert their innocence. Cf. Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 11, which gives a trial judge discretion to 'refuse to accept a plea of guilty * * *.' We need not now delineate the scope of that discretion.\n\n\n12\n North Carolina no longer permits pleas of guilty to capital charges but it appears that pleas of guilty may still be offered to lesser included offenses. See n. 1, supra.\n\n\n1\n The courts of appeals have expressed varying opinions on this question. Compare McCoy v. United States, 124 U.S.App.D.C. 177, 179\u2014180, 363 F.2d 306, 308\u2014309 (1966); Bruce v. United States, 126 U.S.App.D.C. 336, 342 n. 17, 379 F.2d 113, 119 n. 17 (1967); Griffin v. United States, 132 U.S.App.D.C. 108, 109\u2014110, 405 F.2d 1378, 1379\u20141380 (1968); Maxwell v. United States, 368 F.2d 735, 739 n. 3 (CA9 1966) (court may accept guilty plea from defendant unable or unwilling to admit guilt), with United States ex rel. Crosby v. Brierley, 404 F.2d 790, 801\u2014802 (CA3 1968); Bailey v. MacDougall, 392 F.2d 155, 158 n. 7 (CA4 1968); Hulsey v. United States, 369 F.2d 284, 287 (CA5 1966) (guilty plea is infirm if accompanied by denial of one or more elements of offense).\n\n\n2\n Brady v.

Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, is not governed by the classification of the offense or by whether or not a jury trial is required. No accused may be deprived of his liberty as the result of any criminal prosecution, whether felony or misdemeanor, in which he was denied the assistance of counsel. In this case, the Supreme Court of Florida erred in holding that petitioner, an indigent who was tried for an offense punishable by imprisonment up to six months, a $1,000 fine, or both, and given a 90-day jail sentence, had no right to court-appointed counsel, on the ground that the right extends only to trials 'for non-petty offenses punishable by more than six months imprisonment.'

The trial was to a judge, and petitioner was unrepresented by counsel. He was sentenced to serve 90 days in jail, and brought this habeas corpus action in the Florida Supreme Court, alleging that, being deprived of his right to counsel, he was unable as an indigent layman properly to raise and present to the trial court good and sufficient defenses to the charge for which he stands convicted. The Florida Supreme Court by a four-to-three decision, in ruling on the right to counsel, followed the line we marked out in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 159, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 1452, 20 L.Ed.2d 491, as respects the right to trial by jury and held that the right to court-appointed counsel extends only to trials 'for non-petty offenses punishable by more than six months imprisonment.' 236 So.2d 442, 443.1\n\n\n2\nThe case is here on a petition for certiorari, which we granted. 401 U.S. 908, 91 S.Ct. 887, 27 L.Ed.2d 805. We reverse.\n\n\n3\nThe Sixth Amendment, which in enumerated situations has been made applicable to the States by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment (see Duncan v. Louisiana, supra; Washington v. Texas, 388 U.s. 14, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019; Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U.S. 213, 87 S.Ct. 988, 18 L.Ed.2d 1; Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923; Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799; and In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 68 S.Ct. 499, 92 L.Ed. 682), provides specified standards for 'all criminal prosecutions.' One is the requirement of a 'public trial.' In re Oliver, supra, held that the right to a 'public trial' was applicable to a state proceeding even though only a 60-day sentence was involved. 333 U.S., at 272, 68 S.Ct., at 507.\n\n\n4\nAnother guarantee is the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation. Still another, the right of confrontation. Pointer v. Texas, supra. And another, compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in one's favor. Washington v. Texas, supra. We have never limited these rights to felonies or to lesser but serious offenses.\n\n\n5\nIn Washington v. Texas, supra, we said, 'We have held that due process requires that the accused have the assistance of counsel for his defense, that he be confronted with the witnesses against him, and that he have the right to a speedy and public trial.' 388 U.S., at 18, 87 S.Ct., at 1922. Respecting the right to a speedy and public trial, the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, the right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses, it was recently stated, 'It is simply not arguable, nor has any court ever held, that the trial of a petty offense may be held in secret, or without notice to the accused of the charges, or that in such cases the defendant has no right to confront his accusers or to compel the attendance of witnesses in his own behalf.' Junker, The Right to Counsel in Misdemeanor Cases, 43 Wash.L.Rev. 685, 705 (1968).\n\n\n6\nDistrict of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U.S. 617, 57 S.Ct. 660, 81 L.Ed. 843, illustrates the point. There, the offense was engaging without a license in the business of dealing in second-hand property, an offense punishable by a fine of $300 or imprisonment for not more than 90 days. The Court held that the offense was a 'petty' one and could be tried without a jury. But the conviction was reversed and a new trial ordered, because the trial court had prejudicially restricted the right of cross-examination, a right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.\n\n\n7\nThe right to trial by jury, also guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment by reason of the Fourteenth, was limited by Duncan v. Louisiana, supra, to trials where the potential punishment was imprisonment for six months or more. But, as the various opinions in Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. 66, 90 S.Ct. 1886, 26 L.Ed.2d 437, make plain, the right to trial by jury has a different genealogy and is brigaded with a system of trial to a judge alone. As stated in Duncan:\n\n\n8\n'Providing an accused with the right to be tried by a jury of      his peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the      corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the complaint,      biased, or eccentric judge. If the defendant preferred the      common-sense judgment of a jury to the more tutored but      perhaps less sympathetic reaction of the single judge, he was      to have it. Beyond this, the jury trial provisions in the      Federal and State Constitutions reflect a fundamental      decision about the exercise of official power\u2014a reluctance to      entrust plenary powers over the life and liberty of the      citizen to one judge or to a group of judges. Fear of      unchecked power, so typical of our State and Federal      Governments in other respects, found expression in the      criminal law in this insistence upon community participation      in the determination of guilt or innocence. The deep      commitment of the Nation to the right of jury trial in      serious criminal cases as a defense against arbitrary law      enforcement qualifies for protection under the Due Process      Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and must therefore be      respected by the States.' 391 U.S., at 156, 88 S.Ct., at      1451.\n\n\n9\nWhile there is historical support for limiting the 'deep commitment' to trial by jury to 'serious criminal cases,'2 there is no such support for a similar limitation on the right to assistance of counsel:\n\n\n10\n'Originally, in England, a person charged with treason or      felony was denied the aid of counsel, except in respect of      legal questions which the accused himself might suggest. At      the same time parties in civil cases and persons accused of      misdemeanors were entitled to the full assistance of counsel.      . . .\n\n\n11\n'(It) appears that in at least twelve of the thirteen      colonies the rule of the English common law, in the respect      now under consideration, had been definitely rejected and the      right to counsel fully recognized in all criminal      prosecutions, save that in one or two instances the right was      limited to capital offenses or to the more serious crimes . .      ..' Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 60, 64\u201465, 53 S.Ct. 55,      61, 77 L.Ed. 158.\n\n\n12\nThe Sixth Amendment thus extended the right to counsel beyond its common-law dimensions. But there is nothing in the language of the Amendment, its history, or in the decisions of this Court, to indicate that it was intended to embody a retraction of the right in petty offenses wherein the common law previously did require that counsel be provided. See James v. Headley, 5 Cir., 410 F.2d 325, 331\u2014332 n. 9.\n\n\n13\nWe reject, therefore, the premise that since prosecutions for crimes punishable by imprisonment for less than six months may be tried without a jury, they may also be tried without a lawyer.\n\n\n14\nThe assistance of counsel is often a requisite to the very existence of a fair trial. The Court in Powell v. Alabama, supra, 287 U.S., at 68\u201469, 53 S.Ct., at 64\u2014a capital case\u2014said:\n\n\n15\n'The right to be heard would be, in many cases, of little      avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by      counsel. Even the intelligent and educated layman has small      and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If charged with      crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself      whether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with      the rules of evidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may      be put on trial without a proper charge, and convicted upon      incompetent evidence, or evidence irrelevant to the issue or      otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and knowledge      adequately to prepare his defense, even though he have a      perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every      step in the proceedings against him. Without it, though he be      not guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does      not know how to establish his innocence. If that be true of      men of intelligence, how much more true is it of the ignorant      and illiterate, or those of feeble intellect.'\n\n\n16\nIn Gideon v. Wainwright, supra (overruling Betts v. Brady, 316 U.S. 455, 62 S.Ct. 1252, 86 L.Ed. 1595), we dealt with a felony trial. But we did not so limit the need of the accused for a lawyer. We said:\n\n\n17\n'(I)n our adversary system of criminal justice, any person      haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be      assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him. This      seems to us to be an obvious truth. Governments, both state      and federal, quite properly spend vast sums of money to establish      machinery to try defendants accused of crime. Lawyers to      prosecute are everywhere deemed essential to protect the      public's interest in an orderly society. Similarly, there are      few defendants charged with crime, few indeed, who fail to      hire the best lawyers they can get to prepare and present      their defenses. That government hires lawyers to prosecute      and defendants who have the money hire lawyers to defend are      the strongest indications of the widespread belief that      lawyers in criminal courts are necessities, not luxuries. The      right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be deemed      fundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries,      but it is in ours. From the very beginning, our state and      national constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on      procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair      trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant      stands equal before the law. This noble ideal cannot be      realized if the poor man charged with crime has to face his      accusers without a lawyer to assist him.' 372 U.S., at 344,      83 S.Ct., at 796.3\n\n\n18\nBoth Powell and Gideon involved felonies. But their rationale has relevance to any criminal trial, where an accused is deprived of his liberty. Powell and Gideon suggest that there are certain fundamental rights applicable to all such criminal prosecutions, even those, such as In re Oliver, supra, where the penalty is 60 days' imprisonment:\n\n\n19\n'A person's right to reasonable notice of a charge against      him, and an opportunity to be heard in his defense\u2014a right to      his day in court\u2014are basic in our system of jurisprudence;      and these rights include, as a minimum, a right to examine      the witnesses against him, to offer testimony, and to be      represented by counsel.' 333 U.S., at 273, 68 S.Ct., at 507      (emphasis supplied).\n\n\n20\nThe requirement of counsel may well be necessary for a fair trial even in a petty-offense prosecution. We are by no means convinced that legal and constitutional questions involved in a case that actually leads to imprisonment even for a brief period are any less complex than when a person can be sent off for six months or more. See, e.g., Powell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514, 88 S.Ct. 2145, 20 L.Ed.2d 1254; Thompson v. Louisville, 362 U.S. 199, 80 S.Ct. 624, 4 L.Ed.2d 654; Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 382 U.S. 87, 86 S.Ct. 211, 15 L.Ed.2d 176.\n\n\n21\nThe trial of vagrancy cases is illustrative. While only brief sentences of imprisonment may be imposed, the cases often bristle with thorny constitutional questions. See Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110.\n\n\n22\nIn re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527, dealt with juvenile delinquency and an offense which, if committed by an adult, would have carried a fine of $5 to $50 or imprisonment in jail for not more than two months (id., at 29, 87 S.Ct., at 1444), but which when committed by a juvenile might lead to his detention in a state institution until he reached the age of 21. Id., at 36 37, 87 S.Ct., at 1448\u20141449. We said (id., at 36, 87 S.Ct., at 1448) that '(t)he juvenile needs the assistance of counsel to cope with problems of law, to make skilled inquiry into the facts, to insist upon regularity of the proceedings, and to ascertain whether he has a defense and to prepare and submit it. The child 'requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him,\" citing Powell v. Alabama, supra, 287 U.S., at 69, 53 S.Ct., at 64. The premise of Gault is that even in prosecutions for offenses less serious than felonies, a fair trial may require the presence of a lawyer.\n\n\n23\nBeyond the problem of trials and appeals is that of the guilty plea, a problem which looms large in misdemeanor as well as in felony cases. Counsel is needed so that the accused may know precisely what he is doing, so that he is fully aware of the prospect of going to jail or prison, and so that he is treated fairly by the prosecution.\n\n\n24\nIn addition, the volume of misdemeanor cases,4 far greater in number than felony prosecutions, may create an obsession for speedy dispositions, regardless of the fairness of the result. The Report by the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society 128 (1967), states:\n\n\n25\n'For example, until legislation last year increased the      number of judges, the District of Columbia Court of General      Sessions had four judges to process the preliminary stages of      more than 1,500 felony cases, 7,500 serious misdemeanor      cases, and 38,000 petty offenses and an equal number of      traffic offenses per year. An inevitable consequence of      volume that large is the almost total preoccupation in such a court with the movement of cases. The calendar      is long, speed often is substituted for care, and casually      arranged out-of-court compromise too often is substituted for      adjudiciation. Inadequate attention tends to be given to the      individual defendant, whether in protecting his rights,      sifting the facts at trial, deciding the social risk he      presents, or determining how to deal with him after      conviction. The frequent result is futility and failure. As      Dean Edward Barrett recently observed:\n\n\n26\n\"Wherever the visitor looks at the system, he finds great      numbers of defendants being processed by harassed and      overworked officials. Police have more cases than they can      investigate. Prosecutors walk into courtrooms to try simple      cases as they take their initial looks at the files. Defense      lawyers appear having had no more than time for hasty      conversations with their clients. Judges face long calendars      with the certain knowledge that their calendars tomorrow and      the next day will be, if anything longer, and so there is no      choice but to dispose of the cases.\n\n\n27\n\"Suddenly it becomes clear that for most defendants in the      criminal process, there is scant regard for them as      individuals. They are numbers on dockets, faceless ones to be      processed and sent on their way. The gap between the theory      and the reality is enormous.\n\n\n28\n\"Very little such observation of the administration of      criminal justice in operation is required to reach the      conclusion that it suffers from basic ills.\"\n\n\n29\nThat picture is seen in almost every report. 'The misdemeanor trial is characterized by insufficient and frequently irresponsible preparation on the part of the defense, the prosecution, and the court. Everything is rush, rush.' Hellerstein, The Importance of the Misdemeanor Case on Trial and Appeal, 28 The Legal Aid Brief Case 151, 152 (1970).\n\n\n30\nThere is evidence of the prejudice which results to misdemeanor defendants from this 'assembly-line justice.' One study concluded that '(m)isdemeanants represented by attorneys are five times as likely to emerge from police court with all charges dismissed as are defendants who face similar charges without counsel.' American Civil Liberties Union, Legal Counsel for Misdemeanants, Preliminary Report 1 (1970).\n\n\n31\nWe must conclude, therefore, that the problems associated with misdemeanor and petty5 offenses often require the presence of counsel to insure the accused a fair trial. Mr. Justice POWELL suggests that these problems are raised even in situations where there is no prospect of imprisonment. Post, at 48. We need not consider the requirements of the Sixth Amendment as regards the right to counsel where loss of liberty is not involved, however, for here petitioner was in fact sentenced to jail. And, as we said in Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S., at 73, 90 S.Ct., at 1890, 'the prospect of imprisonment for however short a time will seldom be viewed by the accused as a trivial or 'petty' matter and may well result in quite serious repercussions affecting his career and his reputation.'6\n\n\n32\nWe hold, therefore, that absent a knowing and intelligent waiver, no person may be imprisoned for any offense, whether classified as petty, misdemeanor, or felony, unless he was represented by counsel at his trial.7\n\n\n33\nThat is the view of the Supreme Court of Oregon, with which we agree. It said in Stevenson v. Holzman, 254 Or. 94, 102, 458 P.2d 414, 418:\n\n\n34\n'We hold that no person may be deprived of his liberty who has been denied the assistance of counsel as      guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. This holding is applicable      to all criminal prosecutions, including prosecutions for      violations of municipal ordinances. The denial of the      assistance of counsel will preclude the imposition of a jail      sentence.'8\n\n\n35\nWe do not sit as an ombudsman to direct state courts how to manage their affairs but only to make clear the federal constitutional requirement. How crimes should be classified is largely a state matter.9 The fact that traffic charges technically fall within the category of 'criminal prosecutions' does not necessarily mean that many of them will be brought into the class10 where imprisonment actually occurs.\n\n\n36\nThe American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice states:\n\n\n37\n'As a matter of sound judicial administration it is      preferable to disregard the characterization of the offense      as felony, misdemeanor or traffic offense. Nor is it adequate      to require the provisionof defense services for all offenses      which carry a sentence to jail or prison. Often, as a      practical matter, such sentences are rarely if ever imposed      for certain types of offenses, so that for all intents and      purposes the punishment they carry is at most a fine. Thus,      the standard seeks to distinguish those classes of cases in      which there is real likelihood that incarceration may follow      conviction from those types in which there is no such      likelihood. It should be noted that the standard does not      recommend a determination of the need for counsel in terms of      the facts of each particular case; it draws a categorical      line at those types of offenses for which incarceration as a      punishment is a practical possibility.' Providing Defense      Services 40 (Approved Draft 1968).\n\n\n38\nUnder the rule we announce today, every judge will know when the trial of a misdemeanor starts that no imprisonment may be imposed, even though local law permits it, unless the accused is represented by counsel. He will have a measure of the seriousness and gravity of the offense and therefore know when to name a lawyer to represent the accused before the trial starts.\n\n\n39\nThe run of misdemeanors will not be affected by today's ruling. But in those that end up in the actual deprivation of a person's liberty, the accused will receive the benefit of 'the guiding hand of counsel' so necessary when one's liberty is in jeopardy.\n\n\n40\nReversed.\n\n\n41\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice STEWART join, concurring.\n\n\n42\nI join the opinion of the Court and add only an observation upon its discussion of legal resources, ante at 37 n. 7. Law students as well as practicing attorneys may provide an important source of legal representation for the indigent. The Council on Legal Education for Professional Responsibility (CLEPR) informs us that more than 125 of the country's 147 accredited law schools have established clinical programs in which facultysupervised students aid clients in a variety of civil and criminal matters.* CLEPR Newsletter, May 1972, p. 2. These programs supplement practice rules enacted in 38 States authorizing students to practice law under prescribed conditions. Ibid. Like the American Bar Association's Model Student Practice Rule (1969), most of these regulations permit students to make supervised court appearances as defense counsel in criminal cases. CLEPR, State Rules Permitting the Student Practice of Law: Comparisons and Comments 13 (1971). Given the huge increase in law school enrollments over the past few years, see Ruud, That Burgeoning Law School Enrollment, 58 A.B.A.J. 146 (1972), I think it plain that law students can be expected to make a significant contribution, quantitatively and qualitatively, to the representation of the poor in many areas, including cases reached by today's decision.\n\n\n43\nMr. Chief Justice BURGER, concurring in the result.\n\n\n44\nI agree with much of the analysis in the opinion of the Court and with Mr. Justice POWELL's appraisal of the problems. Were I able to confine my focus solely to the burden that the States will have to bear in providing counsel, I would be inclined, at this stage of the development of the constitutional right to counsel, to conclude that there is much to commend drawing the line at penalties in excess of six months' confinement. Yet several cogent factors suggest the infirmities in any approach that allows confinement for any period without the aid of counsel at trial; any deprivation of liberty is a serious matter. The issues that must be dealt with in a trial for a petty offense or a misdemeanor may often be simpler than those involved in a felony trial and yet be beyond the capability of a layman, especially when he is opposed by a law-trained prosecutor. There is little ground, therefore, to assume that a defendant, unaided by counsel, will be any more able adequately to defend himself against the lesser charges that may involve confinement than more serious charges. Appeal from a conviction after an uncounseled trial is not likely to be of much help to a defendant since the die is usually case when judgment is entered on an uncounseled trial record.\n\n\n45\nTrial judges sitting in petty and misdemeanor cases\u2014and prosecutors\u2014should recognize exactly what will be required by today's decision. Because no individual can be imprisoned unless he is represented by counsel, the trial judge and the prosecutor will have to engage in a predictive evaluation of each case to determine whether there is a significant likelihood that, if the defendant is convicted, the trial judge will sentence him to a jail term. The judge can preserve the option of a jail sentence only by offering counsel to any defendant unable to retain counsel on his own. This need to predict will place a new load on courts already overburdened and already compelled to deal with far more cases in one day than is reasonable and proper. Yet the prediction is not one beyond the capacity of an experienced judge, aided as he should be by the prosecuting officer. As to jury cases, the latter should be prepared to inform the judge as to any prior record of the accused, the general nature of the case against the accused, including any use of violence, the severity of harm to the victim, the impact on the community, and the other factors relevant to the sentencing process. Since the judge ought to have some degree of such information after judgment of guilt is determined, ways can be found in the more serious misdemeanor cases when jury trial is not waived to make it available to the judge before trial.* This will not mean a full 'presentence' report on every defendant in every case before the jury passes on guilt, but a prosecutor should know before trial whether he intends to urge a jail sentence, and if he does he should be prepared to aid the court with the factual and legal basis for his view on that score.\n\n\n46\nThis will mean not only that more defense counse must be provided, but also additional prosecutors and better facilities for securing information about the accused as it bears on the probability of a decision to confine.\n\n\n47\nThe step we take today should cause no surprise to the legal profession. More than five years ago the profession, speaking through the American Bar Association in a Report on Standards Relating to Providing Defense Services, determined that society's goal should be 'that the system for providing counsel and facilities for the defense be as good as the system which society provides for the prosecution.' American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Providing Defense Services 1 (Approved Draft 1968). The ABA was not addressing itself, as we must in this case, to the constitutional requirement but only to the broad policy issue. Elsewhere in the Report the ABA stated that:\n\n\n48\n'The fundamental premise of these standards is that      representation by counsel is desirable in criminal cases both      from the viewpoint of the defendant and of society.' Id., at      3.\n\n\n49\nAfter considering the same general factors involved in the issue we decide today, the ABA Report specifically concluded that:\n\n\n50\n'Counsel should be provided in all criminal proceedings for      offenses punishable by loss of liberty, except those types of      offenses for which such punishment is not likely to be      imposed, regardless of their denomination as felonies,      misdemeanors or otherwise.' Id., \u00a7 4.1, pp. 37\u201438.\n\n\n51\nIn a companion ABA Report on Standards Relating to the Prosecution Function and the Defense Function the same basic theme appears in the positive standard cast in these terms:\n\n\n52\n'Counsel for the accused is an essential component of the      administration of criminal justice. A court properly      constituted to hear a criminal case must be viewed as a      tripartite entity consisting of the judge (and jury, where      appropriate), counsel for the prosecution, and counsel for      the accused.' Id., at 153 (Approved Draft 1968).\n\n\n53\nThe right to counsel has historically been an evolving concept. The constitutional requirements with respect to the issue have dated in recent times from Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932), to Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963). Part of this evolution has been expressed in the policy prescriptions of the legal profession itself, and the contributions of the organized bar and individual lawyers\u2014such as those appointed to represent the indigent defendants in the Powell and Gideon cases\u2014have been notable. The holding of the Court today may well add large new burdens on a profession already overtaxed, but the dynamics of the profession have a way of rising to the burdens placed on it.\n\n\n54\nMr. Justice POWELL, with whom Mr. Justice REHNQUIST joins, concurring in the result.\n\n\n55\nGideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), held that the States were required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to furnish counsel to all indigent defendants charged with felonies.1 The question before us today is whether an indigent defendant convicted of an offense carrying a maximum punishment of six months' imprisonment, a fine of $1,000, or both, and sentenced to 90 days in jail, is entitled as a matter of constitutional right to the assistance of appointd counsel. The broader question is whether the Due Process Clause requires that an indigent charged with a state petty offense2 be afforded the right to appointed counsel.\n\n\n56\nIn the case under review, the Supreme Court of Florida agreed that indigents charged with serious misdemeanors were entitled to appointed counsel, but, by a vote of four to three, it limited that right to offenses punishable by more than six months' imprisonment.3 The state court, in drawing a six-month line, followed the lead of this Court in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968), and in the subsequent case of Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. 66, 90 S.Ct. 1886, 26 L.Ed.2d 437 (1970), which was decided shortly after the opinion below, in which the Court held that the due process right to a trial by jury in state criminal cases was limited to cases in which the offense charged was punishable by more than six months' imprisonment. It is clear that whenever the right-to-counsel line is to be drawn, it must be drawn so that an indigent has a right to appointed counsel in all cases in which there is a due process right to a jury trial. An unskilled layman may be able to defend himself in a nonjury trial before a judge experienced in piecing together unassembled facts, but before a jury the guiding hand of counsel is needed to marshal the evidence into a coherent whole consistent with the best case on behalf of the defendant. If there is no accompanying right to counsel, the right to trial by jury becomes meaningless.\n\n\n57\nLimiting the right to jury trial to cases in which the offense charged is punishable by more than six months' imprisonment does not compel the conclusion that the indigent's right to appointed counsel must be similarly restricted. The Court's opinions in Duncan, Baldwin, and District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U.S. 617, 57 S.Ct. 660, 81 L.Ed. 843 (1937), reveal that the jury-trial limitation has historic origins at common law. No such history exists to support a similar limitation of the right to counsel; to the contrary, at common law, the right to counsel was available in misdemeanor but not in felony cases.4 Only as recently as Gideon has an indigent in a state trial had a right to appointed counsel in felony cases. Moreover, the interest protected by the right to have guilt or innocence determined by a jury\u2014tempering the possibly arbitrary and harsh exercise of prosecutorial and judicial power5\u2014while important, is not as fundamental to the guarantee of a fair trial as is the right to counsel.6\n\n\n58\nI am unable to agree with the Supreme Court of Florida that an indigent defendant, charged with a petty offense, may in every case be afforded a fair trial without the assistance of counsel. Nor can I agree with the new rule of due process, today enunciated by the Court, that 'absent a knowing and intelligent waiver, no person may be imprisoned . . . unless he was represented by counsel at his trial.' Ante, at 37. It seems to me that the line should not be drawn with such rigidity.\n\n\n59\nThere is a middle course, between the extremes of Florida's six-month rule and the Court's rule, which comports with the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. I would adhere to the principle of due process that requires fundamental fairness in criminal trials, a principle which I believe encompasses the right to counsel in petty cases whenever the assistance of counsel is necessary to assure a fair trial.\n\n\n60\n* I am in accord with the Court that an indigent accused's need for the assistance of counsel does not mysteriously evaporate when he is charged with an offense punishable by six months or less. In Powell v. Alabama7 and Gideon,8 both of which involved felony prosecutions, this Court noted that few laymen can present adequately their own cases, much less identify and argue relevant legal questions. Many petty offenses will also present complex legal and factual issues that may not be fairly tried if the defendant is not assisted by counsel. Even in relatively simple cases, some defendants, because of ignorance or some other handicap, will be incapable of defending themselves. The consequences of a misdemeanor conviction, whether they be a brief period served under the sometimes deplorable conditions found in local jails or the effect of a criminal record on employability, are frequently of sufficient magnitude not to be casually dismissed by the label 'petty.'9\n\n\n61\nSerious consequences also may result from convictions not punishable by imprisonment. Stigma may attach to a drunken-driving conviction or a hit-and-run escapade.10 Losing one's driver's license is more serious for some individuals than a brief stay in jail. In Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 91 S.Ct. 1586, 29 L.Ed.2d 90 (1971), we said:\n\n\n62\n'Once licenses are issued, as in petitioner's case, their      continued possession may become essential in the pursuit of a      livelihood. Suspension, of issued licenses thus involves      state action that adjudicates important interests of the      licensees. In such cases the licenses are not to be taken      away without that procedural due process required by the      Fourteenth Amendment.' Id., at 539, 91 S.Ct., at 1589.\n\n\n63\nWhen the deprivation of property rights and interest is of sufficient consequence,11 denying the assistance of counsel to indigents who are incapable of defending themselves is a denial of due process.\n\n\n64\nThis is not to say that due process requires the appointment of counsel in all petty cases, or that assessment of the possible consequences of conviction is the sole test for the need for assistance of counsel. The flat six-month rule of the Florida court and the equally inflexible rule of the majority opinion apply to all cases within their defined areas regardless of circumstances. It is precisely because of this mechanistic application that I find these alternatives unsatisfactory. Due process, perhaps the most fundamental concept in our law, embodies principles of fairness rather than immutable line drawing as to every aspect of a criminal trial. While counsel is often essential to a fair trial, this is by no means a universal fact. Some petty offense cases are complex; others are exceedingly simple. As a justification for furnishing counsel to indigents accused of felonies, this Court noted, 'That government hires lawyers to prosecute and defendants who have the money hire lawyers to defend are the strongest indications of the widespread belief that lawyers in criminal courts are necessities, not luxuries.'12 Yet government often does not hire lawyers to prosecute petty offenses; instead the arresting police officer presents the case. Nor does every defendant who can afford to do so hire lawyers to defend petty charges. Where the possibility of a jail sentence is remote and the probable fine seems small, or where the evidence of guilt is overwhelming, the costs of assistance of counsel may exceed the benefits.13 It is anomalous that the Court's opinion today will extend the right of appointed counsel to indigent defendants in cases where the right to counsel would rarely be exercised by nonindigent defendants.\n\n\n65\nIndeed, one of the effects of this ruling will be to favor defendants classified as indigents over those not so classified, yet who are in low-income groups where engaging counsel in a minor petty-offense case would be a luxury the family could not afford. The line between indigency and assumed capacity to pay for counsel is necessarily somewhat arbitrary, drawn differently from State to State and often resulting in serious inequities to accused persons. The Court's new rule will accent the disadvantage of being barely self-sufficient economically.\n\n\n66\nA survey of state courts in which misdemeanors are tried showed that procedures were often informal, presided over by lay judges. Jury trials were rare, and the prosecution was not vigorous.14 It is as inaccurate to say that no defendant can obtain a fair trial without the assistance of counsel in such courts as it is to say that no defendant needs the assistance of counsel if the offense charged is only a petty one.15\n\n\n67\nDespite its overbreadth, the easiest solution would be a prophylactic rule that would require the appointment of counsel to indigents in all criminal cases. The simplicity of such a rule is appealing because it could be applied automatically in every case, but the price of pursuing this easy course could be high indeed in terms of its adverse impact on the administration of the criminal justice systems of 50 States. This is apparent when one reflects on the wide variety of petty or misdemeanor offenses, the varying definitions thereof, and the diversity of penalties prescribed. The potential impact on state court systems is also apparent in view of the variations in types of courts and their jurisdictions, ranging from justices of the peace and part-time judges in the small communities to the elaborately staffed police courts which operate 24 hours a day in the great metropolitan centers.\n\n\n68\nThe rule adopted today does not go all the way. It is limited to petty-offense cases in which the sentence is some imprisonment. The thrust of the Court's position indicates, however, that when the decision must be made, the rule will be extended to all petty-offense cases except perhaps the most minor traffic violations. If the Court rejects on constitutional grounds, as it has today, the exercise of any judicial discretion as to need for counsel if a jail sentence is imposed, one must assume a similar rejection of discretion in other petty-offense cases. It would be illogical\u2014and without discernible support in the Constitution\u2014to hold that no discretion may ever be exercised where a nominal jail sentence is contemplated and at the same time endorse the legitimacy of discretion in 'non-jail' petty-offense cases which may result in far more serious consequences than a few hours or days of incarceration.\n\n\n69\nThe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee that property, as well as life and liberty, may not be taken from a person without affording him due process of law. The majority opinion suggests no constitutional basis for distinguishing between deprivations of liberty and property. In fact, the majority suggests no reason at all for drawing this distinction. The logic it advances for extending the right to counsel to all cases in which the penalty of any imprisonment is imposed applies equally well to cases in which other penalties may be imposed. Nor does the majority deny that some 'non-jail' penalties are more serious than brief jail sentences.\n\n\n70\nThus, although the new rule is extended today only to the imprisonment category of cases, the Court's opinion foreshadows the adoption of a broad prophylactic rule applicable to all petty offenses. No one can foresee the consequences of such a drastic enlargement of the constitutional right to free counsel. But even today's decision could have a seriously adverse impact upon the day-to-day functioning of the criminal justice system. We should be slow to fashion a new constitutional rule with consequences of such unknown dimensions, especially since it is supported neither by history nor precedent.\n\nII\n\n71\nThe majority opinion concludes that, absent a valid waiver, a person may not be imprisoned even for lesser offenses unless he was represented by counsel at the trial. In simplest terms this means that under no circumstances, in any court in the land, may anyone be imprisoned\u2014however briefly\u2014unless he was represented by, or waived his right to, counsel. The opinion is disquietingly barren of details as to how this rule will be implemented.\n\n\n72\nThere are thousands of statutes and ordinances which authorize imprisonment for six months or less, usually as an alternative to a fine. These offenses include some of the most trivial of misdemeanors, ranging from spitting on the sidewalk to certain traffic offenses. They also include a variety of more serious misdemeanors. This broad spectrum of petty-offense cases daily floods the lower criminal courts. The rule laid down today will confront the judges of each of these courts with an awkward dilemma. If counsel is not appointed or knowingly waived, no sentence of imprisonment for any duration may be imposed. The judge will therefore be forced to decide in advance of trial\u2014and without hearing the evidence\u2014whether he will forgo entirely his judicial discretion to impose some sentence of imprisonment and abandon his responsibility to consider the full range of punishments established by the legislature. His alternatives, assuming the availability of counsel, will be to appoint counsel and retain the discretion vested in him by law, or to abandon this discretion in advance and proceed without counsel.\n\n\n73\nIf the latter course is followed, the first victim of the new rule is likely to be the concept that justice requires a personalized decision both as to guilt and the sentence. The notion that sentencing should be tailored to fit the crime and the individual would have to be abandoned in many categories of offenses. In resolving the dilemma as to how to administer the new rule, judges will be tempted arbitrarily to divide petty offenses into two categories\u2014those for which sentences of imprisonment may be imposed and those in which no such sentence will be given regardless of the statutory authorization. In creating categories of offenses which by law are imprisonable but for which he would not impose jail sentences, a judge will be overruling de facto the legislative determination as to the appropriate range of punishment for the particular offense. It is true, as the majority notes, that there are some classes of imprisonable offenses for which imprisonment is rarely imposed. But even in these, the occasional imposition of such a sentence may serve a valuable deterrent purpose. At least the legislatures, and until today the courts, have viewed the threat of imprisonment\u2014even when rarely carried out\u2014as serving a legitimate social function.\n\n\n74\nIn the brief for the United States as amicus curiae, the Solicitor General suggested that some flexibility could be preserved through the technique of trial de novo if the evidence contrary to pretrial assumptions\u2014justified a jail sentence. Presumably a mistrial would be declared, counsel appointed, and a new trial ordered. But the Solicitor General also recognized that a second trial, even with counsel, might be unfair if the prosecutor could make use of evidence which came out at the first trial when the accused was uncounseled. If the second trial were held before the same judge, he might no longer be open-minded. Finally, a second trial held for no other reason than to afford the judge an opportunity to impose a harsher sentence might run afoul of the guarantee against being twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense.16 In all likelihood, there will be no second trial and certain offenses classified by legislatures as imprisonable, will be treated by judges as unimprisonable.\n\n\n75\nThe new rule announced today also could result in equal protection problems. There may well be an unfair and unequal treatment of individual defendants, depending on whether the individual judge has determined in advance to leave open the option of imprisonment. Thus, an accused indigent would be entitled in some courts to counsel while in other courts in the same jurisdiction an indigent accused of the same offense would have no counsel. Since the services of counsel may be essential to a fair trial even in cases in which no jail sentence is imposed, the results of this type of pretrial judgment could be arbitrary and discriminatory.\n\n\n76\nA different type of discrimination could result in the typical petty-offense case where judgment in the alternative is prescribed: for example, 'five days in jail or $100 fine.' If a judge has predetermined that no imprisonment will be imposed with respect to a particular category of cases, the indigent who is convicted will often receive no meaningful sentence. The defendant who can pay a $100 fine, and does so, will have responded to the sentence in accordance with law, whereas the indigent who commits the identical offense may pay no penalty. Nor would there be any deterrent against the repetition of similar offenses by indigents.17\n\n\n77\nTo avoid these equal protection problems and to preserve a range of sentencing options as prescribed by law, most judges are likely to appoint counsel for indigents in all but the most minor offenses where jail sentences are extremely rare. It is doubtful that the States possess the necessary resources to meet this sudden expansion of the right to counsel. The Solicitor General, who suggested on behalf of the United States the rule the Court today adopts, recognized that the consequences could be far reaching. In addition to the expense of compensating counsel, he noted that the mandatory requirement of defense counsel will 'require more pre-trial time of prosecutors, more courtroom time, and this will lead to bigger backlogs with present personnel. Court reporters will be needed as well as counsel, and they are one of our worst bottlenecks.'18\n\n\n78\nAfter emphasizing that the new constitutional rule should not be made retroactive, the Solicitor General commented on the 'chaos' which could result from any mandatory requirement of counsel in misdemeanor cases:\n\n\n79\n'(I)f . . . this Court's decision should become fully      applicable on the day it is announced, there could be a      massive pileup in the state courts which do not now meet this      standard. This would involve delays and frustrations which      would not be a real contribution to the administration of      justice.'19\n\n\n80\nThe degree of the Solicitor General's concern is reflected by his admittedly unique suggesion regarding the extraordinary demand for counsel which would result from the new rule. Recognizing implicitly that, in many sections of the country, there simply will not be enough lawyers available to meet this demand either in the short or long term, the Solicitor General speculated whether 'clergymen, social workers, probation officers, and other persons of that type' could be used 'as counsel in certain types of cases involving relatively small sentences.'20 Quite apart from the practical and political problem of amending the laws of each of the 50 States which require a license to practice law, it is difficult to square this suggestion with the meaning of the term 'assistance of counsel' long recognized in our law.\n\n\n81\nThe majority's treatment of the consequences of the new rule which so concerned the Solicitor General is not reassuring. In a footnote, it is said that there are presently 355,200 attorneys and that the number will increase rapidly, doubling by 1985. This is asserted to be sufficient to provide the number of full-time counsel, estimated by one source at between 1,575 and 2,300, to represent all indigent misdemeanants, excluding traffic offenders. It is totally unrealistic to imply that 355,200 lawyers are potentially available. Thousands of these are not in practice, and many of those who do practice work for governments, corporate legal departments, or the Armed Services and are unavailable for criminal representation. Of those in general practice, we have no indication how many are qualified to defend criminal cases or willing to accept assignments which may prove less than lucrative for most.21\n\n\n82\nIt is similarly unrealistic to suggest that implementation of the Court's new rule will require no more than 1,575 to 2,300 'full-time' lawyers. In few communities are there full-time public defenders available for, or private lawyers specializing in, petty cases. Thus, if it were possible at all, it would be necessary to coordinate the schedules of those lawyers who are willing to take an occasional misdemeanor oppointment with the crowded calendars of lower courts in which cases are not scheduled weeks in advance but instead are frequently tried the day after arrest. Finally, the majority's focus on aggregate figures ignores the heart of the problem, which is the distribution and availability of lawyers, especially in the hundreds of small localities across the country.\n\n\n83\nPerhaps the most serious potential impact of today's holding will be on our already overburdened local courts.22 The primary cause of 'assembly line' justice is a volume of cases far in excess of the capacity of the system to handle efficiently and fairly. The Court's rule may well exacerbate delay and congestion in these courts. We are familiar with the common tactic of counsel of exhausting every possible legal avenue, often without due regard to its probable payoff. In some cases this may be the lawyer's duty; in other cases it will be done for purposes of delay.23 The absence of direct economic impact on the client, plus the omnipresent ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, frequently produces a decision to litigate every issue. It is likely that young lawyers, fresh out of law school, will receive most of the appointments in petty-offense cases. The admirable zeal of these lawyers; their eagerness to make a reputation; the time their not yet crowded schedules permit them to devote to relatively minor legal problems; their desire for courtroom exposure; the availability in some cases of hourly fees, lucrative to the novice; and the recent constitutional explosion in procedural rights for the accused\u2014all these factors are likely to result in the stretching out of the process with consequent increased costs to the public and added delay and congestion in the courts.24\n\n\n84\nThere is an additional problem. The ability of various States and localities to furnish counsel varies widely. Even if there were adequate resources on a national basis, the uneven distribution of these resources\u2014of lawyers, of facilities, and available funding\u2014presents the most acute problem. A number of state courts have considered the question before the Court in this case, and have been compelled to confront these realities. Many have concluded that the indigent's right to appointed counsel does not extend to all misdemeanor cases. In reaching this conclusion, the state courts have drawn the right-to-counsel line in different places, and most have acknowledged that they were moved to do so, at least in part, by the impracticality of going further.25 In other States, legislatures and courts through the enactment of laws or rules have drawn the line short of that adopted by the majority.26 These cases and statutes reflect the judgment of the courts and legislatures of many States, which understand the problems of local judicial systems better than this Court, that the rule announced by the Court today may seriously overtax capabilities.27\n\n\n85\nThe papers filed in a recent petition to this Court for a writ of certiorari serve as an example of what today's ruling will mean in some localities. In November 1971 the petition in Wright v. Town of Wood, No. 71\u20145722, was filed with this Court. The case, arising out of a South Dakota police magistrate court conviction for the municipal offense of public intoxication, raises the same issues before us in this case. The Court requested that the town of Wood file a response. On March 8, 1972, a lawyer occasionally employed by the town filed with the clerk an affidavit explaining why the town had not responded. He explained that Wood, South Dakota, has a population of 132, that it has no sewer or water system and is quite poor, that the office of the nearest lawyer is in a town 40 miles away, and that the town had decided that contesting this case would be an unwise allocation of its limited resources.\n\n\n86\nThough undoubtedly smaller than most, Wood is not dissimilar to hundreds of communities in the United States with no or very few lawyers, with meager financial resources, but with the need to have some sort of local court system to deal with minor offenses.28 It is quite common for the more numerous petty offenses in such towns to be tried by local courts or magistrates while the more serious offenses are tried in a county-wide court located in the county seat.29 It is undoubtedly true that some injustices result from the informal procedures of these local courts when counsel is not furnished; certainly counsel should be furnished to some indigents in some cases. But to require that counsel be furnished virtually every indigent charged with an imprisonable offense would be a practical impossibility for many small town courts. The community could simply not enforce its own laws.30\n\n\n87\nPerhaps it will be said that I give undue weight both to the likelihood of short-term 'chaos' and to the possibility of long-term adverse effects on the system. The answer may be given that if the Constitution requires the rule announced by the majority, the consequences are immaterial. If I were satisfied that the guarantee of due process required the assistance of counsel in every case in which a jail sentence is imposed or that the only workable method of insuring justice is to adopt the majority's rule, I would not hesitate to join the Court's opinion despite my misgivings as to its effect upon the administration of justice. But in addition to the resulting problems of availability of counsel, of costs, and especially of intolerable delay in an already overburdened system, the majority's drawing of a new inflexible rule may raise more Fourteenth Amendment problems than it resolves. Although the Court's opinion does not deal explicitly with any sentence other than deprivation of liberty however brief, the according of special constitutional status to cases where such a sentence is imposed may derogate from the need for counsel in other types of cases, unless the Court embraces an even broader prophylactic rule. Due process requires a fair trial in all cases. Neither the six-month rule approved below nor the rule today enunciated by the Court is likely to achieve this result.\n\nIII\n\n88\nI would hold that the right to counsel in petty-offense cases is not absolute but is one to be determined by the trial courts exercising a judicial discretion on a case-by-case basis.31 The determination should be made before the accused formally pleads; many petty cases are resolved by guilty pleas in which the assistance of counsel may be required.32 If the trial court should conclude that the assistance of counsel is not required in any case, it should state its reasons so that the issue could be preserved for review. The trial court would then become obligated to scrutinize carefully the subsequent proceedings for the protection of the defendant. If an unrepresented defendant sought to enter a plea of guilty, the Court should examine the case against him to insure that there is admissible evidence tending to support the elements of the offense. If a case went to trial without defense counsel, the court should intervene, when necessary, to insure that the defendant adequately brings out the facts in his favor and to prevent legal issues from being overlooked. Formal trial rules should not be applied strictly against unrepresented defendants. Finally, appellate courts should carefully scrutinize all decisions not to appoint counsel and the proceedings which follow.\n\n\n89\nIt is impossible, as well as unwise, to create a precise and detailed set of guidelines for judges to follow in determining whether the appointment of counsel is necessary to assure a fair trial. Certainly three general factors should be weighed. First, the court should consider the complexity of the offense charged. For example, charges of traffic law infractions would rarely present complex legal or factual questions, but charges that contain difficult intent elements or which raise collateral legal questions, such as search-and-seizure problems, would usually be too complex for an unassisted layman. If the offense were one where the State is represented by counsel and where most defendants who can afford to do so obtain counsel there would be a strong indication that the indigent also needs the assistance of counsel.\n\n\n90\nSecond, the court should consider the probable sentence that will follow if a conviction is obtained. The more serious the likely consequences, the greater is the probability that a lawyer should be appointed. As noted in Part I above, imprisonment is not the only serious consequence the court should consider.\n\n\n91\nThird, the court should consider the individual factors peculiar to each case. These, of course, would be the most difficult to anticipate. One relevant factor would be the competency of the individual defendant to present his own case. The attitude of the community toward a particular defendant or particular incident would be another consideration. But there might be other reasons why a defendant would have a peculiar need for a lawyer which would compel the appointment of counsel in a case where the court would normally think this unnecessary. Obviously, the sensitivity and diligence of individual judges would be crucial to the operation of a rule of fundamental fairness requiring the consideration of the varying factors in each case.\n\n\n92\nSuch a rule is similar in certain respects to the special-circumstances rule applied to felony cases in Betts v. Brady, 316 U.S. 455, 62 S.Ct. 1252, 86 L.Ed. 1595 (1942), and Bute v. Illinois, 333 U.S. 640, 68 S.Ct. 763, 92 L.Ed. 986 (1948), which this Court overruled in Gideon.33 One ofthe reasons for seeking a more definitive standard in felony cases was the failure of many state courts to live up to their responsibilities in determining on a case-by-case basis whether counsel should be appointed. See the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan in Gideon, 372 U.S., at 350\u2014351, 83 S.Ct., at 800\u2014801. But this Court should not assume that the past insensitivity of some state courts to the rights of defendants will continue. Certainly if the Court follows the course of reading rigid rules into the Constitution, so that the state courts will be unable to exercise judicial discretion within the limits of fundamental fairness, there is little reason to think that insensitivity will abate.\n\n\n93\nIn concluding, I emphasize my longheld conviction that the adversary system functions best and most fairly only when all parties are represented by competent counsel. Before becoming a member of this Court, I participated in efforts to enlarge and extend the availability of counsel. The correct disposition of this case, therefore, has been a matter of considerable concern to me\u2014as it has to the other members of the Court. We are all strongly drawn to the ideal of extending the right to counsel, but I differ as to two fundamentals: (i) what the Constitution requires, and (ii) the effect upon the criminal justice system, especially in the smaller cities and the thousands of police, municipal, and justice of the peace courts across the country.\n\n\n94\nThe view I have expressed in this opinion would accord considerable discretion to the courts, and would allow the flexibility and opportunity for adjustment which seems so necessary when we are imposing new doctrine on the lowest level of courts of 50 States. Although this view would not precipitate the 'chaos' predicted by the Solicitor General as the probable result of the Court's absolutist rule, there would still remain serious practical problems resulting from the expansion of indigents' rights to counsel in petty-offense cases.34 But the according of reviewable discretion to the courts in determining when counsel is necessary for a fair trial, rather than mandating a completely inflexible rule, would facilitate an orderly transition to a far wider availability and use of defense counsel.\n\n\n95\nIn this process, the courts of first instance which decide these cases would have to recognize a duty to consider the need for counsel in every case where the defendant faces a significant penalty. The factors mentioned above, and such standards or guidelines to assure fairness as might be prescribed in each jurisdiction by legislation or rule of court, should be considered where relevant. The goal should be, in accord with the essence of the adversary system, to expand as rapidly as practicable the availability of counsel so that no person accused of crime must stand alone if counsel is needed.\n\n\n96\nAs the proceedings in the courts below were not in accord with the views expressed above, I concur in the result of the decision in this case.\n\n\n\n1\n For a survey of the opinions of judges, prosecutors, and defenders concerning the right to counsel of persons charged with misdemeanors, see 1 L. Silverstein, Defense of the Poor in Criminal Cases in American State Courts 127\u2014135 (1965).\nA review of federal and state decisions following Gideon is contained in Comment, Right to Counsel: The Impact of Gideon v. Wainwright in the Fifty States, 3 Creighton L.Rev. 103 (1970).\nTwelve States provide counsel for indigents accused of 'serious crime' in the misdemeanor category. Id., at 119\u2014124.\nNineteen States provide for the appointment of counsel in most misdemeanor cases. Id., at 124\u2014133. One of these is Oregon, whose Supreme Court said in Stevenson v. Holzman, 254 Or. 94, 100 101, 458 P.2d 414, 418, 'If our objective is to insure a fair trial in every criminal prosecution the need for counsel is not determined by the seriousness of the crime. The assistance of counsel will best avoid conviction of the innocent\u2014an objective as important in the municipal court as in a court of general jurisdiction.'\nCalifornia's requirement extends to traffic violations. Blake v. Municipal Court, 242 Cal.App.2d 731, 51 Cal.Rptr. Court, 242 Cal.App.2d 731, 51 Cal.Rptr. 771.\nOverall, 31 States have now extended the right to defendants charged with crimes less serious than felonies. Comment, Right to Counsel, supra, at 134.\n\n\n2\n See Frankfurter & Corcoran, Petty Federal Offenses and the Constitutional Guaranty of Trial by Jury, 39 Harv.L.Rev. 917, 980 982 (1926); James v. Headley, 5 Cir., 410 F.2d 325, 331. Cf. Kaye, Petty Offenders Have No Peers!, 26 U.Chi.L.Rev. 245 (1959).\n\n\n3\n See also Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 462\u2014463, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1022, 82 L.Ed. 1461:\n'(The Sixth Amendment) embodies a realistic recognition of the obvious truth that the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to protect himself when brought before a tribunal with power to take his life or liberty, wherein the prosecution is (re)presented by experienced and learned counsel. That which is simple, orderly and necessary to the lawyer\u2014to the untrained layman\u2014may appear intricate, complex, and mysterious.'\n\n\n4\n In 1965, 314,000 defendants were charged with felonies in state courts, and 24,000 were charged with felonies in federal courts. President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, Task Force Report: The Courts 55 (1967). Exclusive of traffic offenses, however, it is estimated that there are annually between four and five million court cases involving misdemeanors. Ibid. And, while there are no authoritative figures, extrapolations indicate that there are probably between 40.8 and 50 million traffic offenses each year. Note, Dollars and Sense of an Expanded Right to Counsel, 55 Iowa L.Rev. 1249, 1261 (1970).\n\n\n5\n Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 defines a petty offense as one in which the penalty does not exceed imprisonment for six months, or a fine of not more than $500, or both. Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(b) provides for the appointment of counsel for indigents in all cases 'other than a petty offense.' But, as the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit noted in James v. Headley, 410 F.2d, at 330\u2014331; Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A, which was enacted as the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, contains a congressional plan for furnishing legal representation at federal expense for certain indigents and does not purport to cover the full range of constitutional rights to counsel.\nIndeed, the Conference Report on the Criminal Justice Act of 1964 made clear the conferees' belief that the right to counsel extends to all offenses, petty and serious alike. H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 1709, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. (1964); U.S.Code & Admin.News, pp. 3000, 3002\u20143003 (1964).\nIn that connection, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, as amended in 1966, provide in Rule 44(a): 'Every defendant who is unable to obtain counsel shall be entitled to have counsel assigned to represent him at every stage of the proceedings from his initial appearance before the commissioner or the court through appeal, unless he waives such appointment.'\nThe Advisory Committee note on Rule 44 says: 'Like the original rule the amended rule provides a right to counsel which is broader in two respects than that for which compensation is provided in the Criminal Justice Act of 1964:\n'(1) The right extends to petty offenses to be tried in the district courts, and\n'(2) The right extends to defendants unable to obtain counsel for reasons other than financial.'\n\n\n6\n See Marston v. Oliver, 324 F.Supp. 691, 696 (ED Va.1971):\n'Any incarceration of over thirty days, more or less, will usually result in loss of employment, with a consequent substantial detriment to the defendant and his family.'\n\n\n7\n We do not share Mr. Justice POWELL's doubt that the Nation's legal resources are sufficient to implement the rule we announce today. It has been estimated that between 1,575 and 2,300 fulltime counsel would be required to represent all indigent misdemeanants, excluding traffic offenders. Note, Dollars and Sense of an Expanded Right to Counsel, 55 Iowa L.Rev. 1249, 1260 1261 (1970). These figures are relatively insignificant when compared to the estimated 355,200 attorneys in the United States (Statistical Abstract of the United States 153 (1971)), a number which is projected to double by the year 1985. See Ruud, That Burgeoning Law School Enrollment, 58 A.B.A.J. 146, 147. Indeed, there are 18,000 new admissions to the bar each year\u20143,500 more lawyers than are required to fill the 'estimated 14,500 average annual openings.' Id., at 148.\n\n\n8\n Article I, \u00a7 9, of the proposed Revised Constitution of Oregon provides:\n'Every person has the right to assistance of counsel in all official proceedings and dealings with public officers that may materially affect him. If he cannot afford counsel, he has the right to have counsel appointed for him in any case in which he may lose his liberty.'\n\n\n9\n One partial solution to the problem of minor offenses may well be to remove them from the court system. The American Bar Association Special Committee on Crime Prevention and Control recently recommended, inter alia, that:\n'Regulation of various types of conduct which harm no one other than those involved (e.g., public drunkenness, narcotics addiction, vagrancy, and deviant sexual behavior) should be taken out of the courts. The handling of these matters should be transferred to nonjudicial entities, such as detoxification centers, narcotics treatment centers and social service agencies. The handling of other non-serious offenses, such as housing code and traffic violations, should be transferred to specialized administrative bodies.' ABA Report, New Perspectives on Urban Crime iv (1972). Such a solution, of course, is peculiarly within the province of state and local legislatures.\n\n\n10\n 'Forty thousand traffic charges (arising out of 150,000 nonparking traffic citations) were disposed of by court action in Seattle during 1964. The study showed, however, that in only about 4,500 cases was there any possibility of imprisonment as the result of a\ntraffic conviction. In only three kinds of cases was the accused exposed to any danger of imprisonment: (1) where the offense charged was hit-and-run, reckless or drunken driving; or (2) where any additional traffic violation was charged against an individual subject to a suspended sentence for a previous violation; or (3) where, whatever the offense charged, the convicted individual was unable to pay the fine imposed.' Junker, The Right to Counsel in Misdemeanor Cases, 43 Wash.L.Rev. 685, 711 (1968).\nOf the 1,288,975 people convicted by the City of New York in 1970 for traffic infractions such as jaywalking and speeding, only 24 were fined and imprisoned, given suspended sentences, or jailed. Criminal Court of the City of New York Annual Report 11 (1970). Of the 19,187 convicted of more serious traffic offenses, such as driving under the influence, reckless driving, and leaving the scene of an accident, 404 (2.1%) were subject to some form of imprisonment. Ibid.\n\n\n*\n A total of 57 law schools have also established clinical programs in corrections, where law students, under faculty supervision, aid prisoners in the preparation of petitions for post-conviction relief. CLEPR Newsletter, May 1972, p. 3. See United States. v. Simpson, 141 U.S.App.D.C. 8, 15\u201416, 436 F.2d 162, 169\u2014170 (1970).\n\n\n*\n In a nonjury case the prior record of the accused should not be made known to the trier of fact except by way of traditional impeachment.\n\n\n1\n While it is true that Mr. Justice Black's opinion for the Court in Gideon is not narrowly written, Mr. Justice Harlan was quick to suggest, in his concurring opinion, that the facts in Gideon did not require the Court to decide whether the indigent's right to appointed counsel should extend to all criminal cases. 372 U.S., at 351, 83 S.Ct., at 800. In opinions announced more recently, the Court has assumed\nthat the holding of Gideon has not yet been extended to misdemeanor cases. See In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 29, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1444, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967); Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128, 134, 88 S.Ct. 254, 256, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967); Burgett v.

Beto, 405 U.S. 473, 92 S.Ct. 1014, 31 L.Ed.2d 374 (1972).\n\n\n2\n As used herein, the term 'petty offense' means any offense where the authorized imprisonment does not exceed six months, Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. 66, 69, 90 S.Ct. 1886, 1888, 26 L.Ed.2d 437 (1970). It also includes all offenses not punishable by imprisonment, regardless of the amount of any fine that might be authorized. To this extent, the definition used herein differs from the federal statutory definition of 'petty offense,' which includes offenses punishable by not more than six months' imprisonment or by a fine not exceeding $500. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1.\n\n\n3\n 236 So.2d 442 (1970).\n\n\n4\n See Powell v.

Wainwright, 375 U.S. 2, 84 S.Ct. 80, 11 L.Ed.2d 41 (1963), we have said that, '(t)he values implemented by the right to jury trial would not measurably be served by requiring retrial of all persons convicted in the past by procedures not consistent with the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial.' De-Stefano v.

Kruger, 280 Mo. 293, 217 S.W. 310 (1919)), disqualification for a licensed profession (Cal.Bus. & Prof.Code \u00a7 3094 (1962) (optometrists); N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 93A\u20144(b) (1965) (real estate brokers)), and loss of pension rights (Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 185.18(3) (1966) (police disability pension denied when injury is result of participation in fights, riots, civil insurrections, or while committing crime); Ind.Ann.Stat. \u00a7 28\u20144616 (1948), IC 1971, 21\u20146\u201413\u201416 (teacher convicted of misdemeanor resulting in imprisonment); Pa.

See generally Project, The Collateral Consequences of a Criminal Conviction, 23 Vand.L.Rev. 929 (1970).\n\n\n12\n Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S., at 344, 83 S.Ct., at 796.\n\n\n13\n In petty offenses, there is much less plea negotiation than in serious offenses. See Report by the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society (hereinafter Challenge) 134 (1967). Thus, in cases where the evidence of guilt is overwhelming, the assistance of counsel is less essential to obtain a lighter sentence.\n\n\n14\n Silverstein, supra, n. 9, at 125\u2014126.\n\n\n15\n Neither the Report by the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice nor the American Bar Association went the route the Court takes today. The President's Commission recommended that counsel be provided for criminal defendants who face 'a significant penalty' and at least to those who are in danger of 'substantial loss of liberty.' Challenge, supra, n. 13, at 150. The American Bar Association standard would not extend the right to counsel to cases where 'loss of liberty' is not 'likely to be imposed.' American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Providing Defense Services. 37\u201440 (Approved Draft 1968). Neither supports a new, inflexible constitutional rule.\n\n\n16\n See Callan v. Wilson, 127 U.S. 540, 8 S.Ct. 1301, 32 L.Ed. 223 (1888); North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969).\n\n\n17\n The type of penalty discussed above (involving the discretionary alternative of 'jail or fine') presents serious problems of fairness\u2014both to indigents and nonindigents and to the administration of justice. Cf. Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. 395, 91 S.Ct. 668, 28 L.Ed.2d 130 (1971). No adequate resolution of these inherently difficult problems has yet been found. The rule adopted by the Court today, depriving the lower courts of all discretion in such cases unless counsel is available and is appointed, could aggravate the problem.\n\n\n18\n Tr. of Oral Arg. 34\u201435.\n\n\n19\n Id., at 36\u201437.\n\n\n20\n Id., at 36\u201437.\n\n\n21\n The custom in many, if not most, localities is to appoint counsel on a case-by-case basis. Compensation is generally inadequate. Even in the federal courts under the Criminal Justice Act of 1964, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A, which provides one of the most generous compensation plans, the rates for appointed counsel\u2014$20 per hour spent out of court, $30 per hour of court time, subject to a maximum total fee of $400 for a misdemeanor case and $1,000 for a felony\u2014are low by American standards. Consequently, the majority of persons willing to accept appointments are the young and inexperienced. See Cappelletti, Part One: The Emergence of a Modern Theme, in Cappelletti & Gordley, Legal Aid: Modern Themes and Variations, 24 Stan.L.Rev. 347, 377\u2014378 (1972). Mr. Justice Brennan suggests, in his concurring opinion, that law students might provide an important source of legal representation. He presents no figures, however, as to how many students would be qualified and willing to undertake the responsibilities of defending indigent misdemeanants. Although welcome progress is being made with programs, supported by the American Bar Association, to enlist the involvement of law students in indigent representation, the problems of meeting state requirements and of assuring the requisite control and supervision, are far from insubstantial. Moreover, the impact of student participation would be limited primarily to the 140 or less communities where these law schools are located.\n\n\n22\n See generally H. James, Crisis in the Courts, c. 2 (1968); Challenge, supra, n. 13, at 145\u2014156.\n\n\n23\n See, e.g., James, supra, n. 22, at 27\u201430; Schrag, On Her Majesty's Secret Service: Protecting the Consumer in New York City, 80 Yale L.J. 1529 (1971).\n\n\n24\n In Cook County, Illinois, a recent study revealed that the members of the Chicago Bar Association's Committee on the Defense of Prisoners who are appointed to represent indigent defendants elect a jury trial in 63% of their trial cases, while other appointed counsel and retained counsel do so in 33% and the public defender in only 15%. 'One possible explanation for this contrast is that committee counsel, who are sometimes serving in part to gain experience, are more willing to undertake a jury trial than is an assistant public defender, who is very busy and very conscious of the probable extra penalty accruing to a defendant who loses his case before a jury.'

Local judges interviewed by the authors concluded that the right to counsel should not be extended to petty cases. 'If no such dividing line can be drawn, if the question of assigned counsel in misdemeanor cases resolves itself into an 'all or nothing' proposition, then, the thrust of their views was that limited funds and lawyer-manpower and the need for judicial economy dictate that it be 'nothing.\" (Footnote omitted.) But see State v. Borst, 278 Minn. 388, 154 N.W.2d 888 (1967).\n\n\n28\n See Cableton v. State, 243 Ark., at 358, 420 S.W.2d, at 538\u2014539: '(T) here are more justices of the peace in Arkansas than there are resident practicing lawyers and . . . there are counties in which there are no practicing lawyers. The impact of (right to counsel in misdemeanor cases) would seriously impair the administration of justice in Arkansas and impose an intolerable burden upon the legal profession.' (Footnote omitted.)\n\n\n29\n See Silverstein, supra, n. 9, at 125\u2014126.\n\n\n30\n The successful implementation of the majority's rule would require state and local governments to appropriate considerable funds, something they have not been willing to do. Three States with 21% of the Nation's population provide more than 50% of all state appropriations for indigent defense. Note, Dollars and Sense of an Expanded Right to Counsel, 55 Iowa L.Rev. 1249, 1265 (1970). For example, in 1971 the State of Kansas spent $570,000 defending indigents in felony cases\u2014up from $376,000 in 1969. Although the budgetary request for 1972 was $612,000, the legislature has appropriated only $400,000. Brief for Appellant in James v. Strange, decided today, 407 U.S. 128, 92 S.Ct. 2027, 32 L.Ed.2d 600. 'In view of American resources the funds spent on the legal services program can only be regarded as trivial.' Cappelletti, supra, n. 21, at 379. 'Although the American economy is over 8 times the size of the British and the American population is almost 4 times as great, American legal aid expenditures are less than 2 times as high.' Id., at 379 n. 210.\n\n\n31\n It seems to me that such an individualized rule, unlike a six-month rule and the majority's rule, does not present equal protection problems under this Court's decisions in Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891 (1956); Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963); and Mayer v. City of Chicago, 404 U.S. 189, 92 S.Ct. 410, 30 L.Ed.2d 372 (1971).\n\n\n32\n See, e.g., Katz, Municipal Courts\u2014Another Urban Ill, 20 Case Western Reserve L.Rev. 87, 92\u201496 (1968). Cf. Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114 (1961); White v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed.2d 193 (1963); Harvey v. Mississippi, 340 F.2d 263 (CA5 1965).\nAlthough there is less plea negotiating in petty caes, see n. 13, supra, the assistance of counsel may still be needed so that the defendant who is not faced with overwhelming evidence of guilt can make an intelligent decision whether to go to trial.\n\n\n33\n I do not disagree with the overruling of Betts; I am in complete accord with Gideon. Betts, like Gideon, concerned the right to counsel in a felony case. See n. 1, supra. Neither case controls today's result.\n\n\n34\n Indeed, it is recognized that many of the problems identified in this opinion will result from any raising of the standards as to the requirement of counsel. It is my view that relying upon judicial discretion to assure fair trial of petty offenses not only comports with the Constitution but will minimize problems which otherwise could affect adversely the administration of criminal justice in the very courts which already are under the most severe strain.\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"374 U.S. 449\n83 S.Ct. 1804\n10 L.Ed.2d 1000\nGeorge K. ROSENBERG, District Director, Immigration  and Naturalization Service, Petitioner,v.George FLEUTI.\nNo. 248.\nArgued March 26, 1963.\nDecided June 17, 1963.\n\nPhilip R. Monahan, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nHirman W. Kwan, Los Angeles, Cal., for respondent.\nMr. Justice GOLDBERG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nRespondent Fleuti is a Swiss national who was originally admitted to this country for permanent residence on October 9, 1952, and has been here continuously since except for a visit of 'about a couple hours' duration to Ensenada, Mexico, in August 1956. The Immigration and Naturalization Service, of which petitioner Rosenberg is the Los Angeles District Director, sought in April 1959 to deport respondent on the ground that at the time of his return in 1956 he 'was within one or more of the classes of aliens excludable by the law existing at the time of such entry,' Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, \u00a7 241(a)(1), 66 Stat. 204, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(1). In particular, the Service alleged that respondent had been 'convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude,' \u00a7 212(a)(9), 66 Stat. 182, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9), before his 1956 return, and had for that reason been excludable when he came back from his brief trip to Mexico. A deportation order issued on that ground, but it was discovered a few months later that the order was invalid, because the crime was a petty offense not of the magnitude encompassed within the statute. The deportation proceedings were thereupon reopened and a new charge was lodged against respondent: that he had been excludable at the time of his 1956 return as an alien 'afflicted with psychopathic personality,' \u00a7 212(a)(4), 66 Stat. 182, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(4), by reason of the fact that he was a homosexual. Deportation was ordered on this ground and Fleuti's appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals was dismissed, whereupon he brought the present action for declaratory judgment and review of the administrative action. It was stipulated that among the issues to be litigated was the question whether \u00a7 212(a)(4) is 'unconstitutional as being vague and ambiguous.' The trial court rejected respondent's contentions in this regard and in general, and granted the Government's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit set aside the deportation order and enjoined its enforcement, holding that as applied to Fleuti \u00a7 212(a)(4) was unconstitutionally vague in that homosexuality was not sufficiently encompassed within the term 'psychopathic personality.' 302 F.2d 652.\n\n\n2\nThe Government petitioned this Court for certiorari, which we granted in order to consider the constitutionality of \u00a7 212(a)(4) as applied to respondent Fleuti. 371 U.S. 859, 83 S.Ct. 117, 9 L.Ed.2d 97. Upon consideration of the case, however, and in accordance with the long-established principle that 'we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality * * * unless such adjudication is unavoidable,' Spector Motor Service, Inc., v. McLaughlin, 323 U.S. 101, 105, 65 S.Ct. 152, 154, 89 L.Ed. 101; see also Alma Motor Co. v. Timken-Detroit Axle Co., 329 U.S. 129, 67 S.Ct. 231, 91 L.Ed. 128; Neese v. Southern R. Co., 350 U.S. 77, 76 S.Ct. 131, 100 L.Ed. 60; Mackey v. Mendoza-Martinez, 362 U.S. 384, 80 S.Ct. 785, 4 L.Ed.2d 812; we have concluded that there is a threshold issue of statutory interpretation in the case, the existence of which obviates decision here as to whether \u00a7 212(a)(4) is constitutional as applied to respondent.\n\n\n3\nThat issue is whether Fleuti's return to the United States from his afternoon trip to Ensenada, Mexico, in August 1956 constituted an 'entry' within the meaning of \u00a7 101(a)(13) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 167, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13), such that Fleuti was excludable for a condition existing at that time even though he had been permanently and continuously resident in this country for nearly four years prior thereto. Section 101(a)(13), which has never been directly construed by this Court in relation to the kind of brief absence from the country that characterizes the present case,1 reads as follows:\n\n\n4\nThe question we must consider, more specifically, is whether Fleuti's short visit to Mexico can possibly be regarded as a 'departure to a foreign port or place * * * (that) was not intended,' within the meaning of the exception to the term 'entry' created by the statute. Whether the 1956 return was within that exception is crucial, because Fleuti concededly was not excludable as a 'psychopathic personality' at the time of his 1952 entry.2\n\n\n5\nThe definition of 'entry' as applied for various purposes in our immigration laws was evolved judicially, only becoming encased in statutory form with the inclusion of \u00a7 101(a)(13) in the 1952 Act. In the early cases there was developed a judicial definition of 'entry' which had harsh consequences for aliens. This viewpoint was expressed most restrictively in United States ex rel. Volpe v. Smith, 289 U.S. 422, 53 S.Ct. 665, 77 L.Ed. 1468, in which the Court, speaking through Mr. Justice McReynolds, upheld deportation of an alien who, after 24 years of residence in this country following a lawful entry, was held to be excludable on his return from 'a brief visit to Cuba,' id., at 423, 53 S.Ct. at 666. The Court stated that 'the word 'entry' * * * includes any coming of an alien from a foreign country into the United States whether such coming be the first or any subsequent one.' Id., at 425, 53 S.Ct. at 667.3 Although cases in the lower courts applying\n\n\n6\nthe strict re-entry doctrine to aliens who had left the country for brief visits to Canada or Mexico or elsewhere were numerous,4 many courts applied the doctrine in such instances with express reluctance and explicit recognition of its harsh consequences,5 and there were a few instances in which district judges refused to hold that aliens who had been absent from the country only briefly had made 'entries' upon their return.6\n\n\n7\nReaction to the severe effects produced by adherence to the strict definition of 'entry' resulted in a substantial inroad being made upon that definition in 1947 by a decision of the Second Circuit and a decision of this Court. The Second Circuit, in an opinion by Judge Learned Hand, refused to allow a deportation which depended on the alien's being regarded as having re-entered this country after having taken an overnight sleeper from Buffalo to Detroit on a route lying through Canada. Di Pasquale v. Karnuth, 158 F.2d 878. Judge Hand recognized that the alien ' acquiesced in whatever route the railroad might choose to pull the car,' id., at 879, but held that it would be too harsh to impute the carrier's intent to the alien, there being no showing that the alien knew he would be entering Canada. 'Were it otherwise,' Judge Hand went on, 'the alien would be subjected without means of protecting himself to the forfeiture of privileges which may be, and often are, of the most grave importance to him.' Ibid. If there were a duty upon aliens to inquire about a carrier's route, it 'would in practice become a trap, whose closing upon them would have no rational relation to anything they could foresee as significant. We cannot believe that Congress meant to subject those who had acquired a residence, to the sport of chance, when the interests at stake may be so momentous.' Ibid. Concluding, Judge Hand said that if the alien's return were held to be an 'entry' under the circumstances, his 'vested interest in his residence' would\n\n\n8\n'be forfeited because of perfectly lawful conduct which he      could not possibly have supposed would result in anything of      the sort. Caprice in the incidence of punishment is one of      the indicia of tyranny, and nothing can be more disingenuous      than to say that deportation in these circumstances is not      punishment. It is well that we should be free to rid      ourselves of those who abuse our hospitality; but it is more      important that the continued enjoyment of that hospitality      once granted, shall not be subject to meaningless and      irrational hazards.' Ibid.\n\n\n9\nLater the same year this Court, because of a conflict between Di Pasquale and Del Guercio v. Delgadillo, 159 F.2d 130 (C.A.9th Cir. 1947), granted certiorari in the latter case and reversed a deportation order affecting an alien who, upon rescue after his intercoastal merchant ship was torpedoed in the Caribbean during World War II, had been taken to Cuba to recuperate for a week before returning to this country. Delgadillo v. Carmichael, 332 U.S. 388, 68 S.Ct. 10, 92 L.Ed. 17. The Court pointed out that it was 'the exigencies of war, not his voluntary act,' id., at 391, 68 S.Ct. at 12, which put the alien on foreign soil, adding that '(w)e might as well hold that if he had been kidnapped and taken to Cuba, he made a statutory 'entry' on his voluntary return. Respect for law does not thrive on captious interpretations.' Ibid. Since '(t)he stakes are indeed high and momentous for the alien who has acquired his residence here,' ibid., the Court held that\n\n\n10\n'(w)e will not attribute to Congress a purpose to make his      right to remain here dependent on circumstances so fortuitous      and capricious as those upon which the Immigration Service      has here seized. The hazards to which we are now asked to      subject the alien are too irrational to square with the      statutory scheme.' Ibid.\n\n\n11\nThe increased protection of returning resident aliens which was brought about by the Delgadillo decision, both in its result and in its express approval of Di Pasquale, was reflected in at least two subsequent lower-court decisions prior to the enactment of \u00a7 101(a)(13). In Yukio Chai v. Bonham, 165 F.2d 207 (C.A.9th Cir. 1947), the court held that no 'entry' had occurred after a ship carrying a resident alien back from seasonal cannery work in Alaska made an unscheduled stop in Vancouver, B.C., and in Carmichael v. Delaney, 170 F.2d 239 (C.A.9th Cir. 1948), the court held that a resident alien returning from wartime service with the United States Maritime Service during which he had stopped at many foreign ports made no 'entry' because all of the movements of the ship to which he had been assigned were pursuant to Navy orders.7\n\n\n12\nIt was in light of all of these developments in the case law that \u00a7 101(a)(13) was included in the immigration laws with the 1952 revision. As the House and Senate Committee Reports, the relevant material from which is quoted in the margin,8 make clear, the major congressional concern in codifying the definition of 'entry' was with 'the status of an alien who has previously entered the United States and resided therein * * *.' This concern was in the direction of ameliorating the harsh results visited upon resident aliens by the rule of United States ex rel. Volpe v. Smith, supra, as is indicated by the recognition that 'the courts have departed from the rigidity of (the earlier) rule,' and the statement that '(t)he bill (gives) due recognition to the judicial precedents.' It must be recognized, of course, that the only liberalizing decisions to which the Reports referred specifically were Di Pasquale and Delgadillo, and that there is no indication one way or the other in the legislative history of what Congress thought about the problem of resident aliens who leave the country for insignificantly short periods of time. Nevertheless, it requires but brief consideration of the policies underlying \u00a7 101(a)(13), and of certain other aspects of the rights of returning resident aliens, to conclude that Congress, in approving the judicial undermining of Volpe, supra, and the relief brought about by the Di Pasquale and Delgadillo decisions, could not have meant to limit the meaning of the exceptions it created in \u00a7 101(a)(13) to the facts of those two cases.\n\n\n13\nThe most basic guide to congressional intent as to the reach of the exceptions is the eloquent language of Di Pasquale and Delgadillo themselves, beginning with the recognition that the 'interests at stake' for the resident alien are 'momentous,' 158 F.2d, at 879, and that '(t)he stakes are indeed high and momentous for the alien who has acquired his residence here,' 332 U.S., at 391, 68 S.Ct. at 12. This general premise of the two decisions impelled the more general conclusion that 'it is * * * important that the continued enjoyment of (our) hospitality once granted, shall not be subject to meaningless and irrational hazards.' 158 F.2d, at 879. See also Delgadillo, supra, at 391, 68 S.Ct. at 12. Coupling these essential principles of the two decisions explicitly approved by Congress in enacting \u00a7 101(a)(13) with the more general observation, appearing in Delgadillo as well as elsewhere,9 that '(d) eportation can be the equivalent of banishment or exile,' it is difficult to conceive that Congress meant its approval of the liberalization wrought by Di Pasquale and Delgadillo to be interpreted mechanistically to apply only to cases presenting factual situations identical to what was involved in those two decisions.\n\n\n14\nThe idea that the exceptions to \u00a7 101(a)(13) should be read nonrestrictively is given additional credence by the way in which the immigration laws define what constitutes 'continuous residence' for an alien wishing to be naturalized. Section 316 of the 1952 Act, 66 Stat. 242\u2014243, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1427, which liberalized previous law in some respects, provides that an alien who wishes to seek naturalization does not begin to endanger the five years of 'continuous residence' in this country which must precede his application until he remains outside the country for six months, and does not damage his position by cumulative temporary absences unless they total over half of the five years preceding the filing of his petition for naturalization. This enlightened concept of what constitutes a meaningful interruption of the continuous residence which must support a petition for naturalization, reflecting as it does a congressional judgment that an alien's status is not necessarily to be endangered by his absence from the country, strengthens the foundation underlying a belief that the exceptions to \u00a7 101(a)(13) should be read to protect resident aliens who are only briefly absent from the country. Of further, although less specific, effect in this regard is this Court's holding in Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding, 344 U.S. 590, 73 S.Ct. 472, 97 L.Ed. 576, that the returning resident alien is entitled as a matter of due process to a hearing on the charges underlying any attempt to exclude him, a holding which supports the general proposition that a resident alien who leaves this country is to be regarded as retaining certain basic rights.\n\n\n15\nGiven that the congressional protection of returning resident aliens in \u00a7 101(a)(13) is not to be woodenly construed, we turn specifically to construction of the exceptions contained in that section as they relate to resident aliens who leave the country briefly. What we face here is another harsh consequence of the strict 'entry' doctrine which, while not governed directly by Delgadillo, nevertheless calls into play the same considerations, pp. 454-456, 458-459, supra, which led to the results specifically approved in the Congressional Committee Reports. It would be as 'fortuitous and capricious,' and as 'irrational to square with the statutory scheme,' Delgadillo, supra, at 391, to hold that an alien may necessarily be deported because he falls into one of the classes enumerated in \u00a7 212(a) when he returns from 'a couple hours' visit to Mexico as it would have been to uphold the order of deportation in Delgadillo. Certainly when an alien like Fleuti who has entered the country lawfully and has acquired a residence here steps across a border and, in effect, steps right back, subjecting him to exclusion for a condition, for which he could not have been deported had he remained in the country seems to be placing him at the mercy of the 'sport of chance' and the 'meaningless and irrational hazards' to which Judge Hand alluded. Di Pasquale, supra, at 879, of 158 F.2d. In making such a casual trip the alien would seldom be aware that he was possibly walking into a trap, for the insignificance of a brief trip to Mexico or Canada bears little rational relation to the punitive consequence of subsequent excludability. There are, of course, valid policy reasons for saying that an alien wishing to retain his classification as a permanent resident of this country imperils his status by interrupting his residence too frequently or for an overly long period of time, but we discern no rational policy supporting application of a re-entry limitation in all cases in which a resident alien crosses an international border for a short visit.10 Certainly if that trip is innocent, casual, and brief, it is consistent with all the discernible signs of congressional purpose to hold that the 'departure * * * was not intended' within the meaning and ameliorative intent of the exception of \u00a7 101(a)(13). Congress unquestionably has the power to exclude all classes of undesirable aliens from this country, and the courts are charged with enforcing such exclusion when Congress has directed it, but we do not think Congress intended to exclude aliens long resident in this country after lawful entry who have merely stepped across an international border and returned in 'about a couple hours.' Such a holding would be inconsistent with the general purpose of Congress in enacting \u00a7 101(a)(13) to ameliorate the severe effects of the strict 'entry' doctrine.\n\n\n16\nWe conclude, then, that it effectuates congressional purpose to construe the intent exception to \u00a7 101(a)(13) as meaning an intent to depart in a manner which can be regarded as meaningfully interruptive of the alien's permanent residence. One major factor relevant to whether such intent can be inferred is, of course, the length of time the alien is absent. Another is the purpose of the visit, for if the purpose of leaving the country is to accomplish some object which is itself contrary to some policy reflected in our immigration laws, it would appear that the interruption of residence thereby occurring would properly be regarded as meaningful. Still another is whether the alien has to procure any travel documents in order to make his trip, since the need to obtain such items might well cause the alien to consider more fully the implications involved in his leaving the country. Although the operation of these and other possibly relevant factors remains to be developed 'by the gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion,' Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U.S. 97, 104, 24 L.Ed. 616, we declare today simply that an innocent, casual, and brief excursion by a resident alien outside this country's borders may not have been 'intended' as a departure disruptive of his resident alien status and therefore may not subject him to the consequences of an 'entry' into the country on his return. The more civilized application of our immigration laws given recognition by Congress in \u00a7 101(a)(13) and other provisions of the 1952 Act protects the resident alien from unsuspected risks and unintended consequences of such a wholly innocent action. Respondent here, so far as appears from the record, is among those to be protected. However, because attention was not previously focused upon the application of \u00a7 101(a)(13) to the case, the record contains no detailed description or characterization of his trip to Mexico in 1956, except for his testimony that he was gone 'about a couple hours,' and that he was 'just visiting; taking a trip.' That being the case, we deem it appropriate to remand the case for further consideration of the application of \u00a7 101(a)(13) to this case in light of our discussion herein. If it is determined that respondent did not 'intend' to depart in the sense contemplated by \u00a7 101(a)(13), the deportation order will not stand and adjudication of the constitutional issue reached by the court below will be obviated. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore vacated and the case remanded with directions that the parties be given leave to amend their pleadings to put in issue the question of 'entry' in accordance with the foregoing, and for further proceedings consistent herewith. So ordered.\n\n\n17\nJudgment vacated and case remanded with directions.\n\n\n18\nMr. Justice CLARK, with whom Mr. Justice HARLAN, Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice WHITE join, dissenting.\n\n\n19\nI dissent from the Court's judgment and opinion because 'statutory construction' means to me that the Court can construe statutes but not that it can construct them. The latter function is reserved to the Congress, which clearly said what it meant and undoubtedly meant what it said when it defined 'entry' for immigration purposes as follows:\n\n\n20\n'The term 'entry' means any coming of an alien into the      United States, from a foreign port or place or from an      outlying possession, whether voluntarily or otherwise, except      that an alien having a lawful permanent residence in the      United States shall not be regarded as making an entry into      the United States for the purposes of the immigration laws if      the alien proves to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that his departure to a foreign port or place or to an      outlying possession was not intended or reasonably to be      expected by him or his presence in a foreign port or place or      in an outlying possession was not voluntary * * *.' 8 U.S.C.      \u00a7 1101(a)(13).\n\n\n21\nThat this definition of 'entry' includes the respondent's entry after his brief trip to Mexico in 1956 is a conclusion which seems to me inescapable. The conclusion is compelled by the plain meaning of the statute, its legislative history, and the consistent interpretation by the federal courts. Indeed, the respondent himself did not even question that his return to the United States was an 'entry' within the meaning of \u00a7 101(a)(13). Nonetheless, the Court has rewritten the Act sua sponte, creating a definition of 'entry' which was suggested by many organizations during the hearings prior to its enactment but which was rejected by the Congress. I believe the authorities discussed in the Court's opinion demonstrate that 'entry' as defined in \u00a7 101(a)(13) cannot mean what the Court says it means, but I will add a few words of explanation.\n\n\n22\nThe word 'entry' had acquired a well-defined meaning for immigration purposes at the time the Immigration and Nationality Act was passed in 1952. The leading case was United States ex rel. Volpe v. Smith, 289 U.S. 422, 53 S.Ct. 665, 77 L.Ed. 1468 (1933), which held that an alien who had resided continuously in the United States for 26 years except for a brief visit to Cuba made an 'entry' at the time of his return from Cuba. The Court there stated that the word 'entry' in the Immigration Act of 1917 'includes any coming of an alien from a foreign country into the United States whether such coming be the first or any subsequent one.' Id., at 425, 53 S.Ct. 667, 77 L.Ed. 1468. That conclusion was based on sound authority, since the Court had earlier held that a resident alien who crossed the river from Detroit to Windsor, Canada, and returned on the same day made an entry upon his return. Lewis v. Frick, 233 U.S. 291, 34 S.Ct. 488, 58 L.Ed. 967 (1914).\n\n\n23\nThe federal courts in numerous cases were called upon to apply this definition of 'entry' and did so consistently, specifically recognizing that the brevity of one's stay outside the country was immaterial to the question of whether his return was an 'entry'. See, e.g., United States ex rel. Kowalenski v. Flynn, 17 F.2d 524 (D.C.W.D.N.Y.1927); Schoeps v. Carmichael, 177 F.2d 391 (C.A.9th Cir. 1949). A related but obviously distinguishable question did create difficulties for the courts, however, leading to conflicting opinions among the Circuits as to whether a resident alien makes an 'entry' when he had no intent to leave the country or did not leave voluntarily. It was decided by this Court in Delgadillo v. Carmichael, 332 U.S. 388, 68 S.Ct. 10, 92 L.Ed. 17 (1947), which held that an alien whose ship had been torpedoed and sunk, after which he was rescued and taken to Cuba for a week, did not make an 'entry' on his return to the United States. The Court discussed the Volpe case but distinguished it and others on the ground that 'those were cases where the alien plainly expected or planned to enter a foreign port or place. Here he was catapulted into the ocean, rescued, and taken to Cuba. He had no part in selecting the foreign port as his destination.' Id., at 390, 68 S.Ct. at 12. The Court specifically relied on Di Pasquale v. Karnuth, 158 F.2d 878 (C.A.2d Cir. 1947), where an alien who had ridden a sleeping car from Buffalo to Detroit, without knowledge that the train's route was through Canada, was held not to have made an 'entry' upon his arrival in Detroit.\n\n\n24\nThese cases and others discussed by the Court establish the setting in which the Immigration and Nationality Act was passed in 1952. The House and Senate reports quoted by the Court show that the Congress recognized the courts' difficulty with the rule that 'any coming of an alien into the United States was an 'entry,' even when the departure from the country was unintentional or involuntary. The reports discuss the broad rule of the Volpe case and the specific limitations of the Di Pasquale and Delgadillo cases, citing those cases by name, and conclude with the following language:\n\n\n25\n'The bill defines the term 'entry' as precisely as      practicable, giving due recognition to the judicial      precedents. Thus any coming of an alien from a foreign port      or place or an outlying possession into the United States is      to be considered an entry, whether voluntary or otherwise,      unless the Attorney General is satisfied that the departure      of the alien, other than a deportee, from this country was      unintentional or was not voluntary.' H.R.Rep.No.1365, 82d      Cong., 2d Sess. 32; S.Rep.No. 1137, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. 4;      U.S. Congressional and Administrative News 1952, p. 1684.\n\n\n26\nThus there is nothing in the legislative history or in the statute itself which would exempt the respondent's return from Mexico from the definition of 'entry'. Rather, the statute in retaining the definition expressed in Volpe seems clearly to cover respondent's entry, which occurred after he knowingly left the United States in order to travel to a city in Mexico. That the trip may have been 'innocent, casual, and brief' does not alter the fact that, in the words of the Court in Delgadillo, the respondent 'plainly expected or planned to enter a foreign port or place.' 332 U.S., at 390, 68 S.Ct. at 12.\n\n\n27\nIt is true that this application of the law to a resident alien may be harsh, but harshness is a far cry from the irrationality condemned in Delgadillo, supra, 332 U.S. at 391, 68 .s.Ct. at 12. There and in Di Pasquale contrary results would have meant that a resident alien, who was not deportable unless he left the country and reentered, could be deported as a result of circumstances either beyond his control or beyond his knowledge. Here, of course, there is no claim that respondent did not know he was leaving the country to enter Mexico and, since one is presumed to know the law, he knew that his brief trip and reentry would render him deportable. The Congress clearly has chosen so to apply the long-established definition, and this Court cannot alter that legislative determination in the guise of statutory construction. Had the Congress not wished the definition of 'entry' to include a return after a brief but voluntary and intentional trip, it could have done so. The Court's discussion of \u00a7 316 of the Act shows that the Congress knows well how to temper rigidity when it wishes. Nor can it be said that the Congress was unaware of the breadth of its definition. Even aside from the evidence that it was aware of the judicial precedents, numerous organizations unsuccessfully urged that the definition be narrowed to accomplish what the Court does today. Thus, it was urged that the Act's definition of 'entry' 'should, we believe, be narrowed so that it will not be applicable to an alien returning from abroad, after a temporary absence, to an unrelinquished domicile here.'1 Other groups complained also that '(t)he term 'entry' is defined to mean any coming of an alien into the United States. It is recommended that this be narrowed to provide that a return, after a temporary absence, to an unrelinquished domicile, shall not constitute a new entry.'2 Despite such urging, however, the Congress made no change in the definition. Further, this Court in 1958 specifically recognized that the word 'entry' retained its plain meaning, stating that 'a resident alien who leaves the country for any period, however brief, does make a new entry on his return * * *.' Bonetti v. Rogers, 356 U.S. 691, 698, 78 S.Ct. 976, 980, 2 L.Ed.2d 1087.\n\n\n28\nAll this to the contrary notwithstanding, the Court today decides that one does not really intend to leave the country unless he plans a long trip, or his journey is for an illegal purpose, or he needs travel documents in order to make the trip. This is clearly contrary to the definition in the Act and to any definition of 'intent' that I was taught.3\n\n\n29\nWhat the Court should do is proceed to the only question which either party sought to resolve: whether the deportation order deprived respondent of due process of law in that the term 'afflicted with psychopathic personality,' as it appears in \u00a7 212(a)(4) of the Act, is unconstitutionally vague. Since it fails to do so, I must dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n Although there is dictum on the point of Bonetti v. Rogers, 356 U.S. 691, 698\u2014699, 78 S.Ct. 976, 2 L.Ed.2d 1087, we regard it as not fully considered, since resolution of the issue was not crucial to decision of the case. Compare Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 213, 73 S.Ct. 625, 97 L.Ed. 956.\n'The term 'entry' means any coming of an alien into the      United States, from a foreign port or place or from an      outlying possession, whether voluntarily or otherwise, except      that an alien having a lawful permanent residence in the      United States shall not be regarded as making an entry into      the United States for the purposes of the immigration laws if      the alien proves to the satisfaction of the Attorney General      that his departure to a foreign port or place or to an      outlying possession was not intended or reasonably to be      expected by him or his presence in a foreign port or place or      in an outlying possession was not voluntary: Provided, That      no person whose departure from the United States was      occasioned by deportation proceedings, extradition, or other      legal process shall be held to be entitled to such      exception.'\n\n\n2\n The 1952 Act became effective on December 24, 1952, and Fleuti entered the country for permanent residence on October 9, 1952, a fact which is of significance because \u00a7 241(a)(1) of the Act only commands the deportation of aliens 'excludable by the law existing at the time of such entry * * *.' Hence, since respondent's homosexuality did not make him excludable by any law existing at the time of his 1952 entry, it is critical to determine whether his return from a few hours in Mexico in 1956 was an 'entry' in the statutory sense. If it was not, the question whether \u00a7 212(a)(4) could constitutionally be applied to him need not be resolved.\n\n\n3\n Previous cases which contain the same general kind of language, but which are distinguishable on their facts, are Lapina v. Williams, 232 U.S. 78, 34 S.Ct. 196, 58 L.Ed. 515; Lewis v. Frick, 233 U.S. 291, 34 S.Ct. 488, 58 L.Ed. 967; United States ex rel. Claussen v.

Corsi, 287 U.S. 129, 53 S.Ct. 40, 77 L.Ed. 215. The only one of these cases which involved an absence from the country as extremely brief as Fleuti's is Lewis v. Frick, and in that case deportation was premised on the fact that on his return from the trip in issue the alien had sought to bring a woman into the country for an immoral purpose. 233 U.S., at 297\u2014300, 34 S.Ct. at 490\u2014492.\n\n\n4\n E.g., Ex parte Parianos, 23 F.2d 918 (C.A.9th Cir. 1928); United States ex rel.

Del Guercio, 256 F.2d 877 (C.A.9th Cir. 1958).\n\n\n8\n The House and Senate Committee Reports preceding enactment of the bill both contained the following relevant paragraph:\n'Section 101(a)(13) defines the term 'entry.' Frequent reference is made to the term 'entry' in the immigration laws, and many consequences relating to the entry and departure of aliens flow from its use, but the term is not precisely defined in the present law. Normally an entry occurs when the alien crosses the border of the United States and makes a physical entry, and the question of whether an entry has been made is susceptible of a precise determination. However, for the purposes of determining the effect of a subsequent entry upon the status of an alien who has previously entered the United States and resided therein, the preciseness of the term 'entry' has not been found to be as apparent. Earlier judicial constructions of the term in the immigration laws, as set forth in United States ex rel. Volpe v. Smith (289 U.S. 422, (53 S.Ct. 665, 77 L.Ed. 1298) (1933)), generally held that the term 'entry' included any coming of an alien from a foreign country to the United States whether such coming be the first or a subsequent one. More recently, the courts have departed from the rigidity of that rule and have recognized that an alien does not make an entry upon his return to the United States from a foreign country where he had no intent to leave the United States (Di Pasquale v. Karnuth, 158 F.2d 878 (C.C.A.2d 1947)), or did not leave the country voluntarily (Delgadillo v. Carmichael, 332 U.S. 388, (68 S.Ct. 10) (1947)). The bill defines the term 'entry' as precisely as practicable, giving due recognition to the judicial precedents. Thus any coming of an alien from a foreign port or place or an outlying possession into the United States is to be considered an entry, whether voluntary or otherwise, unless the Attorney General is satisfied that the departure of the alien, other than a deportee, from this country was unintentional or was not voluntary.'

Silverberg, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nMr. Walter G. Cooper, Atlanta, Ga., for respondent.\nMr. Justice CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nRespondent, while serving as an enlisted soldier in the United States Army in Germany, was convicted by a general court-martial of committing murder on December 25, 1946, in violation of the 92d Article of War, 41 Stat. 805, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1564, 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1564. The sentence imposed was dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and life imprisonment, which was reduced to twenty years upon recommendation of the Judge Advocate General. On petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the District Court for the Northern District of Georgia ordered respondent discharged from the federal penitentiary in Atlanta, 81 F.Supp. 647 (1948), and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, one judge dissenting. 175 F.2d 273, 277 (1949). Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals concluded that the military tribunal which convicted respondent was improperly constituted and lacked jurisdiction of the offense. The Court of Appeals held further that the record was 'replete with highly prejudicial errors and irregularities' which deprived respondent of due process of law under the Fifth Amendment and afforded an independent ground for sustaining the writ. We brought the case here, on petition of the warden having custody of respondent, in view of the importance of the decision below in the administration of military justice. 1949, 338 U.S. 890, 70 S.Ct. 239. Our jurisdiction to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals is under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1254(1).1\n\n\n2\nRespondent was tried in Germany on January 9 and 14, 1947, before a general court-martial which had been appointed by order of the commanding general of the Continental Base Section, European Theatre, on December 7, 1946. The detail appointed was comprised of a trial judge advocate and two assistant trial judge advocates, defense counsel and two assistant defense counsel, the law member and twelve other officers. The ranking officer of the detail, a Colonel of the Field Artillery with twenty-five years of commissioned service, was appointed law member. The only member of the detail appointed from the Judge Advocate General's Department was a captain who was designated an assistant trial judge advocate.2 He was absent from respondent's trial on verbal orders of the commanding general.\n\n\n3\nThe Court of Appeals determined that under these circumstances the court-martial had been appointed in disregard of the 8th Article of War, 41 Stat. 788, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1479, 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1479. The relevant provision of this article as in force at the time of respondent's trial is set forth in the margin.3 The article was interpreted by the Court of Appeals as requiring, 'certainly in times of peace, that the presence of a duly qualified law member from the Judge Advocate General's Department be made a jurisdictional prerequisite to the validity of such court-martial proceeding, except in the single instance where such officer is actually, and in fact, 'not available.\" 175 F.2d at page 276. The Court of Appeals held that the availability of a law member from the Judge Advocate General's Department was conclusively indicated by the order detailing an officer from that department in another capacity without any explanation. Thus the court concluded that the proceeding was void.\n\n\n4\nWe are unable to agree with the Court of Appeals that this record discloses any disregard of the 8th Article of War in the appointment of the tribunal which convicted respondent.\n\n\n5\nUnder the interpretation placed on the 8th Article by the court below, an officer from the Judge Advocate General's Department was 'available' for appointment as law member if he was appointed on the detail in another capacity and nothing otherwise appeared to negative his availability as law member. The article has been construed differently by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Henry v. Hodges, 1948, 171 F.2d 401. In that case, in which the interpretative issue was similarly raised on petition for habeas corpus, one officer from the Judge Advocate General's Department had been appointed trial judge advocate and a second designated counsel for another accused. The court through Judge Learned Hand declared:\n\n\n6\n'There remains the * * * question * * * whether any member of the Judge Advocate General's Department was 'available' at the time. We cannot say that it was not more in the interest of justice to detail Beatty to defend Feltman than to put him on the court; or that it was not better judgment to make Swan a prosecutor than a judge * * *. The whole question is especially one of discretion; and, if it is ever reviewable, certainly the record at bar is without evidence which would justify a review. The commanding officer who convenes the court must decide what membership will be least to the 'injury of the service,' and what officers are 'available.' 'Available' means more than presently 'accessible'; it demands a balance between the conflicting demands upon the service, and it must be determined on the spot.' 171 F.2d at page 403.\n\n\n7\nWe agree with the latter interpretation that the availability of an officer as law member was intended by Congress to be a matter within the sound discretion of the appointing authority. Ordinarily the 'availability' of military personnel who are subject to assignment by an appointing authority is understood to depend upon a discretionary determination by the superior. Cf. Kahn v. Anderson, 1921, 255 U.S. 1, 41 S.Ct. 224, 65 L.Ed. 469; Swaim v. United States, 1897, 165 U.S. 553, 17 S.Ct. 448, 41 L.Ed. 823; Mullan v. United States, 1891, 140 U.S. 240, 11 S.Ct. 788, 35 L.Ed. 489; Martin v. Mott, 1827, 12 Wheat. 19, 6 L.Ed. 537. Moreover, the phrase adopted in the 8th Article, 'available for the purpose,' expresses a clear intent that the concept of availability should include the exercise of discretion by the appointing authority.4\n\n\n8\nThe 8th Article has also been consistently interpreted and applied by the Army as vesting a discretion in the appointing authority, which when exercised is conclusive in determining not only the accessibility of personnel but also the suitability of the officer detailed as the law member of a general court-martial. CM 231963, Hatteberg, 18 B.R. 349, 366\u2014369 (1943); CM ETO 804, Ogletree, 2 B.R. (ETO) 337, 346 (1943); CM 209988, Cromwell, 9 B.R. 169, 196 (1938); Digest of Opinions of The Judge Advocate General (1912\u20141940) \u00a7 365(9). This established interpretation is entitled to great weight in our determination of the meaning of the article. Cf. United States ex rel. Hirshberg v. Cooke, 1949, 336 U.S. 210, 216, 69 S.Ct. 530, 533.\n\n\n9\nThe exercise of the discretion thus conferred on the appointing authority may be reviewed by the courts only if a gross abuse of that discretion would have given rise to a defect in the jurisdiction of the court-martial.5 However, we need not determine at this time whether the provision of the 8th Article relied upon below imposed a requirement going to the jurisdiction of the court-martial, for nothing in the record here involved indicates that the discretion of the appointing authority was improperly exercised. Clearly no abuse is disclosed by the appointment of an officer from the Judge Advocate General's Department to a capacity other than law member on the detail, or by reassignment of that officer to other duty at the time of trial, or by the standard of competence in legal matters shown by the law member at the trial.\n\n\n10\nThe Court of Appeals also concluded that certain errors committed by the military tribunal and reviewing authorities had deprived respondent of due process.6 We think the court was in error in extending its review, for the purpose of determining compliance with the due process clause, to such matters as the propositions of law set forth in the staff judge advocate's report, the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain respondent's conviction, the adequacy of the pretrial investigation, and the competence of the law member and defense counsel. Cf. Humphrey v. Smith, 1949, 336 U.S. 695, 69 S.Ct. 830. It is well settled that 'by habeas corpus the civil courts exercise no supervisory or correcting power over the proceedings of a court-martial * * *. The single inquiry, the test, is jurisdiction.' In re Grimley, 1890, 137 U.S. 147, 150, 11 S.Ct. 54, 34 L.Ed. 636. In this case the court-martial had jurisdiction of the person accused and the offense charged, and acted within its lawful powers. The correction of any errors it may have committed is for the military authorities which are alone authorized to review its decision. Application of Yamashita, 1946, 327 U.S. 1, 8-9, 66 S.Ct. 340, 344, 345, 90 L.Ed. 499; Swaim v. United States, supra, 165 U.S. at page 562, 17 S.Ct. at page 451, 41 L.Ed. 823.\n\n\n11\nIt results that the judgment is reversed.\n\n\n12\nReversed.\n\n\n13\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n14\nMr. Justice BURTON, concurring.\n\n\n15\nI concur on the ground that the clause in the 8th Article of War, which deals with the availability of an officer of the Judge Advocate General's Department and is here at issue, is purely directory, and not jurisdictional. The 8th Article, in any event, calls for the appointment as the law member of a general court-martial of an officer meeting certain specifications. He must be either an officer of the Judge Advocate General's Department or he must be selected by the appointing authority as specially qualified for his duties. The unavailability of an officer of the Judge Advocate General's Department merely opens the field of eligibility to other branches of the service.\n\n\n16\nIt may be assumed that, when the general court-martial involved in this case was appointed, it was a jurisdictional requirement that there be a law member appointed to it. It also may be assumed that it was a jurisdictional requirement that, if the appointing authority determined that no officer of the Judge Advocate General's Department was then 'available for the purpose,' such authority was restricted to the appointment of 'an officer of some other branch of the service selected by (him) * * * as specially qualified to perform the duties of law member.' (Emphasis supplied.) If the officer who was appointed met neither requirement, it may be assumed that the court-martial would have been without jurisdiction. If, however, as in this case, it is not questioned that the law member met the second requirement, I believe that we should not permit a review here of the discretion used by the appointing authority in determining the preliminary administrative question of whether or not an officer of the Judge Advocate General's Department was 'available for the purpose.' We should not permit it, even if it is alleged that the appointing authority's discretion in this regard was grossly abused. That detail was a matter within his administrative responsibility and should not be available as a basis for collateral attack upon the jurisdiction of an otherwise qualified and competent general court-martial.\n\n\n\n1\n Respondent contends that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review a court of appeals' judgment ordering discharge of a prisoner or affirming such an order, in view of the omission from revised Title 28 of any provision comparable to former \u00a7 463(c) which expressly authorized review of such judgments on certiorari. We think this contention is without merit in view of the broad provision of \u00a7 1254 that 'Cases in the courts of appeals may be reviewed by the Supreme Court * * * (1) By writ of certiorari granted upon the petition of any party to any civil or criminal case * * *.'\n\n\n2\n The Court of Appeals stated in its opinion that two officers of the Judge Advocate General's Department were appointed to the detail. However, the record indicates that only one of those mentioned below was appointed from that department.\n\n\n3\n 'The authority appointing a general court-martial shall detail as one of the members thereof a law member, who shall be an officer of the Judge Advocate General's Department, except that when an officer of that department is not available for the purpose the appointing authority shall detail instead an officer of some other branch of the service selected by the appointing authority as specially qualified to perform the duties of law member. * * *' 41 Stat. 788, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1479, 10 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1479. The 8th Article was amended substantially in 1948, 62 Stat. 628 629. See note 5, infra.\n\n\n4\n The relevant legislative history of the provision of the 8th Article relating to the law member supports this interpretation. Prior to the adoption of the 8th Article of War in 1920, military law did not provide for the service of a law member on a court-martial. Under the impetus for reform following World War I, the original draft of what became the 8th Article provided that every general court-martial should have a judge advocate whose duties were to be similar to those of the 'law member,' as finally provided for. The proposed Article would have provided further that such judge advocate of the court be a member of the Judge Advocate General's Department or an officer whose qualifications were approved by the Judge Advocate General. Hearings on S. 64, Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs, 66th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 5. The proposed Article was, however, abandoned for the provisions of the 8th Article. See 18 B.R. 349, 366\u2014367 (1943).\n\n\n5\n The 8th Article of War, as in force since February 1, 1949, expressly imposes as a jurisdictional requirement that the law member be an officer from the Judge Advocate General's Department or an officer whose qualification for such detail has been certified by the Judge Advocate General. 62 Stat. 628\u2014629.\n\n\n6\n The following instances of error in the military proceedings were cited by the Court of Appeals:\n'(1) Accused was convicted on the theory that although he was on duty as a sentry at the time of the offense, it was incumbent upon him to retreat from his post of duty.\n'(2) Accused has been convicted of murder on evidence that does not measure to malice, premeditation, or deliberation.\n'(3) The record reveals that the law member appointed was grossly incompetent.\n'(4) There was no pre-trial investigation whatever upon the charge of murder.\n'(5) The record shows that counsel appointed to defend the accused was incompetent, gave no preparation to the case, and submitted only a token defense.\n'(6) The appellate reviews by the Army reviewing authorities reveal a total misconception of the applicable law.' 175 F.2d at page 277.\n\n\n","label":1}

The petitioners1 were brought to trial and convicted on informations charging them with violating Title 14, Article 103(7), of the Louisiana Criminal Code, 1942, LSA\u2014R.S. 14:103(7), in that 'they refused to move from a cafe counter seat * * * after having been ordered to do so by the agent (of the establishment); said conduct being in such manner as to unreasonably and foreseeably disturb the public * * *.' In accordance with state procedure, petitioners sought post-conviction review in the Supreme Court of Louisiana through writs of certiorari, mandamus and prohibition. They contended that the State had presented no evidence to support the findings of statutory violation, and that their convictions were invalid on other constitutional grounds, both state and federal. Relief was denied. Federal questions were properly raised and preserved throughout the proceedings, and timely petitions for certiorari filed in this Court were granted. 365 U.S. 840, 81 S.Ct. 801, 5 L.Ed.2d 801. The United States Government appeared as amicus curiae urging, on various grounds, that the convictions be reversed. An amicus brief also urging reversal was filed by the Committee on the Bill of Rights of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York.\n\n\n2\nIn our view of these cases and for our disposition of them, the slight variance in the facts of the three cases is immaterial. Although the alleged offenses did not occur on the same day or in the same establishment, the petitioners were all arrested by the same officers, charged with commission of the same acts, represented by the same counsel, tried and convicted by the same judge, and given identical sentences. Because of this factual similarity and the identical nature of the problems involved in granting certiorari, we ordered the cases consolidated for argument and now deem it sufficient to file one opinion. In addition, as the facts are simple, we think it sufficient to recite but one of the cases in detail, noting whatever slight variations exist in the others.\n\n\n3\nIn No. 28, Hoston et al. v. Louisiana, Jannette Hoston, a student at Southern University, and six of her colleagues took seats at a lunch counter in Kress' Department Store in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on March 29, 1960.2 In Kress', as in Sitman's Drug Store in No. 26 where Negroes are considered 'very good customers,' a segregation policy is maintained only with regard to the service of food.3 Hence, although both stores solicit business from white and Negro patrons, and the latter as well as the former may make purchases in the general merchandise sections without discrimination,4 the stores do not provide integrated service at their lunch counters.\n\n\n4\nThe manager at Kress' store, who was also seated at the lunch counter, told the waitress to advise the students that they could be served at the counter across the aisle, which she did. The petitioners made no response and remained quietly in their seats. After the manager had finished his lunch, he telephoned the police and told them that '(some Negroes) were seated at the counter reserved for whites.' The police arrived at the store and ordered the students to leave. The arresting officer testified that the petitioners did and said nothing except that one of them stated that she would like a glass of iced tea, but that he believed they were disturbing the peace 'by sitting there.' When none of the petitioners showed signs of leaving their seats, they were placed under arrest and taken to the police station. They were then charged with violating Title 14, Article 103(7), of the Louisiana Criminal Code, a section of the Louisiana disturbance of the peace statute.\n\n\n5\nBefore trial, the petitioners moved for a bill of particulars as to the details of their allegedly disruptive behavior and to quash the informations for failure to state any unlawful acts of which they could be constitutionally convicted. The motions were denied, and the petitioners applied to the Supreme Court of Louisiana for writs of certiorari, prohibition and mandamus to review the rulings. The Supreme Court denied the writs on the ground that an adequate remedy was available through resort to its supervisory jurisdiction in the event of a conviction. The petitioners were then tried and convicted,5 and sentenced to imprisonment for four months, three months of which would be suspended upon the payment of a fine of $100. Subsequent to their convictions, the Supreme Court, in denying relief on appeal, issued the following oral opinion in each case.\n\n\n6\n'Writs refused.\n\n\n7\n'This court is without jurisdiction to review facts in      criminal cases. See Art. 7, Sec. 10, La. Constitution of 1921      (LSA).\n\n\n8\n'The rulings of the district judge on matters of law are not      erroneous. See Town of Ponchatoula v. Bates, 173 La., 824,      138 So., 851.'6\n\n\n9\nBefore this Court, petitioners and the amici have presented a number of questions claiming deprivation of rights guaranteed to petitioners by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.7 The petitioners contend:\n\n\n10\n(a) The decision below affirms a criminal conviction based      upon no evidence of guilt and, therefore, deprives them of      due process of law as defined in Thompson v. City of      Louisville, 362 U.S. 199, 80 S.Ct. 624, 4 L.Ed.2d 654.\n\n\n11\n(b) The petitioners were convicted of a crime under the      provisions of a state statute which, as applied to their      acts, is so vague, indefinite and uncertain as to offend the      Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n12\n(c) The decisions below conflict with the Fourteenth      Amendment's guarantee of freedom of expression.\n\n\n13\n(d) The decision below conflicts with prior decisions of this      Court which condemn racially discriminatory administration of State criminal laws in      contravention of the Equal Protection Clause of the      Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n14\nWith regard to argument (d), the petitioners and the New York Committee on the Bill of Rights contend that the participation of the police and the judiciary to enforce a state custom of segregation resulted in the use of 'state action' and was therefore plainly violative of the Fourteenth Amendment. The petitioners also urge that even if these cases contain a relevant component of 'private action,' that action is substantially infected with state power and thereby remains state action for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.8\n\n\n15\nIn the view we take of the cases we find it unnecessary to reach the broader constitutional questions presented, and in accordance with our practice not to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts presented in the record, for the reasons hereinafter stated, we hold that the convictions in these cases are so totally devoid of evidentiary support as to render them unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.9 As in Thompson v. City of Louisville, 362 U.S. 199, 80 S.Ct. 624, 4 L.Ed.2d 654, our inquiry does not turn on a question of sufficiency of evidence to support a conviction, but on whether these convictions rest upon any evidence which would support a finding that the petitioners' acts caused a disturbance of the peace. In addition, we cannot be concerned with whether the evidence proves the commission of some other crime, for it is as much a denial of due process to send an accused to prison following conviction for a charge that was never made as it is to convict him upon a charge for which there is no evidence to support that conviction.10\n\n\n16\nThe respondent, in both its brief and its argument to this Court, implied that the evidence proves the elements of a criminal trespass. In oral argument it contended that the real question here 'is whether or not a private property owner and proprietor of a private establishment has the right to serve only those whom he chooses and to refuse to serve those whom he desires not to serve for whatever reason he may determine.'11 That this is not a question presented by the records in these cases seems too apparent for debate. Even assuming it were the question, however, which it clearly is not, these convictions could not stand for the reason stated in Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U.S. 196, 68 S.Ct. 514, 92 L.Ed. 644.12\n\n\n17\nUnder our view of these cases, our task is to determine whether there is any evidence in the records to show that the petitioners, by their actions at the lunch counters in the business establishments involved, violated Title 14, Article 103 (7), of the Louisiana Criminal Code. At the time of petitioners' acts, Article 103 provided:\n\n\n18\n'Disturbing the peace is the doing of any of the following in      such a manner as would foreseeably disturb or alarm the      public:\n\n\n19\n'(1) Engaging in a fistic encounter; or\n\n\n20\n'(2) Using of any unnecessarily loud, offensive, or insulting      language; or\n\n\n21\n'(3) Appearing in an intoxicated condition; or\n\n\n22\n'(4) Engaging in any act in a violent and tumultuous manner      by any three or more persons; or\n\n\n23\n'(5) Holding of an unlawful assembly; or\n\n\n24\n'(6) Interruption of any lawful assembly of people; or\n\n\n25\n'(7) Commission of any other act in such a manner as to      unreasonably disturb or alarm the public.'\n\nI.\n\n26\nOur initial inquiry is necessarily to determine the type of conduct proscribed by this statute and the elements of guilt which the evidence must prove to support a criminal conviction thereunder. First, it is evident from a reading of the statute that the accused must conduct himself in a manner that would 'foreseeably disturb or alarm the public.' In addition, when a person is charged with a violation of Paragraph 7, an earlier version of which was aptly described by the Supreme Court of Louisiana as 'the general portion of the statute which does not define the 'conduct or acts' the members of the Legislature had in mind' (State v. Sanford, 203 La. 961, 967, 14 So.2d 778, 780),13 it would also seem apparent from the words of the statute that the acts, whatever they might be, must be done 'in such a manner as to (actually) unreasonably disturb or alarm the public.' However, because we find the records barren of any evidence that would support a finding that the petitioners' conduct would even 'foreseeably' have disturbed the public, we need not consider whether the statute also requires the acts to be done in a manner as actually to disturb the peace.\n\n\n27\nWe of course are bound by a State's interpretation of its own statute and will not substitute our judgment for that of the State's when it becomes necessary to analyze the evidence for the purpose of determining whether that evidence supports the findings of a state court. Hence, we must look to Louisiana for guidance in the meaning of the phrase 'foreseeably disturb or alarm the public' in order to determine the type of conduct proscribed by LSA\u2014R.S. 14:103(7).\n\n\n28\nThe Supreme Court of Louisiana has had occasion in the past, in interpreting the predecessor of Article 103,14 to give content to these words, and it is evident from the court's prior treatment of them that they were not intended to embrace peaceful conduct. On the contrary, it is plain that under the court's application of the statute these words encompass only conduct which is violent or boisterous in itself, or which is provocative in the sense that it induces a foreseeable physical disturbance.15 In State v. Sanford, 203 La. 961, 14 So.2d 778, the evidence showed that thirty Jehovah's Witnesses approached a Louisiana town for the purpose of distributing religious tracts and persuading the public to make contributions to their cause. The Witnesses were warned by the mayor and police officers that 'their presence and activities would cause trouble among the population and asked them to stay away from the town * * *.' 203 La., at 964, 14 So.2d, at 779. The Witnesses failed to yield to the warning and proceeded on their mission. The trial court found that the acts of the Witnesses in entering the town and stopping passersby in the crowded street 'might or would tend to incite riotous and disorderly conduct.' 203 La., at 965, 14 So.2d, at 779. The Supreme Court of Louisiana set aside convictions for breach of the peace, holding that the defendants did not commit any unlawful act or pursue any disorderly course of conduct which would tend to disturb the peace, thus, in effect, that peaceful conduct, even though conceivably offensive to another class of the public, is not conduct which may be proscribed by Louisiana's disturbance of the peace statute without evidence that the actor conducted himself in some outwardly unruly manner.\n\n\n29\nThe conclusion of the highest Louisiana court that the breach of the peace statute does not reach peaceful and orderly conduct is substantiated by the conclusion drawn from reading the statute as a whole. The catch-all provision under which the petitioners were tried and convicted follows an enumeration of six specific offenses, each of which describes overtly tumultuous or disruptive behavior. It would therefore normally be interpreted in the light of the preceding sections as an effort to cover other forms of violence or loud and boisterous conduct not already listed.16 We do not mean to imply that an ejusdem generis reading of the statute is constitutionally compelled to the exclusion of other reasonable interpretations,17 but we do note that here such a reading is consistent with the Louisiana Supreme Court's application in Sanford.18\n\n\n30\nFurther evidence that Article 103(7) was not designed to encompass the petitioners' conduct in these cases has been supplied by the Louisiana Legislature. Shortly after the events for which the petitioners were arrested took place, the legislature amended its disturbance of the peace statute in an obvious attempt to reach the type of activity involved in these cases.19 The contrast between the language of the present statute and the one under which the petitioners were convicted confirms the interpretation given the general terms of the latter by the Supreme Court in State v. Sanford and the natural meaning of the words used in Article 103.\n\n\n31\nWe are aware that the Louisiana courts have the final authority to interpret and, where they see fit, to reinterpret that State's legislation. However, we have seen no indication that the Louisiana Supreme Court has changed its Sanford interpretation of LSA\u2014R.S. 14:103(7), and we will not infer that an inferior Louisiana court intended to overrule a long-standing and reasonable interpretation of a state statute by that State's highest court. Our reluctance so to infer is supported, moreover, by the fact that State v. Sanford was argued by the petitioners to both the trial court and the Supreme Court, and that neither court mentioned in its opinion that Sanford was no longer to be the law in Louisiana.\n\n\n32\nWe think that the above discussion would given ample support to a conclusion that Louisiana law requires a finding of outwardly boisterous or unruly conduct in order to charge a defendant with 'foreseeably' disturbing or alarming the public. However, because this case comes to us from a state court and necessitates a delicate involvement in federal-state relations, we are willing to assume with the respondent that the Louisiana courts might construe the statute more broadly to encompass the traditional common-law concept of disturbing the peace. Thus construed, it might permit the police to prevent an imminent public commotion even though caused by peaceful and orderly conduct on the part of the accused. Cf. Cantwell v. State of Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 308, 60 S.Ct. 900, 905, 84 L.Ed. 1213. We therefore treat these cases as though evidence of such imminent danger, as well as evidence of a defendant's active conduct which is outwardly provocative, could support a finding that the acts might 'foreseeably disturb or alarm the public' under the Louisiana statute.\n\nII.\n\n33\nHaving determined what evidence is necessary to support a finding of disturbing the peace under Louisiana law, the ultimate question, as in Thompson v. City of Louisville, supra, is whether the records in these cases contain any such evidence. With appropriate notations to the slight differences in testimony in the other two cases, we again turn to the record in No. 28.20 The manager of the department store in which the lunch counter was located testified that after the students had taken their seats at the 'white lunch counter' where he was also occupying a seat, he advised the waitress on duty to offer the petitioners service at the counter across the aisle which served Negroes. The petitioners, however, after being 'advised that they would be served at the other counter,' remained in their seats, and the manager continued eating his lunch at the same counter. In No. 26, where there were no facilities to serve colored persons, the petitioners were merely told that they couldn't be served, but were never even asked to move. In No. 27, a waitress testified that the petitioners were merely told that they would have to go 'to the other side to be served.' The petitioners not only made no speeches, they did not even speak to anyone except to order food; they carried no placards, and did nothing, beyond their mere presence at the lunch counter, to attract attention to themselves or to others. In none of the cases was there any testimony that the petitioners were told that their mere presence was causing, or was likely to cause, a disturbance of the peace, nor that the petitioners were ever asked to leave the counters or the establishments by anyone connected with the stores.\n\n\n34\nThe manager in No. 28 testified that after finishing his meal he went to the telephone and called the police department, advising them that Negroes were in his store sitting at the lunch counter reserved for whites. This is the only case in which 'the owner or his agent' notified the police of the petitioners' presence at the lunch counter, and even here the manager gave no indication to the officers that he feared any disturbance or that he had received any complaint concerning the petitioners' presence. In No. 27, a waitress testified that a bus driver sitting in the restaurant notified the police that 'there were several colored people sitting at the lunch counter.'21 In No. 26, the arresting officers were not summoned to the drugstore by anyone even remotely connected with Sitman's but, rather, by a call from an officer on his 'beat' who had observed the petitioners sitting quietly at the lunch counter.\n\n\n35\nAlthough the manager of Kress' Department Store testified that the only conduct which he considered disruptive was the petitioners' mere presence at the counter, he did state that he called the police because he 'feared that some disturbance might occur.'22 However, his fear is completely unsubstantiated by the record. The manager continued eating his lunch in an apparently leisurely manner at the same counter at which the petitioners were sitting before calling the police. Moreover, not only did he fail to give the petitioners any warning of his alleged 'fear,'23 but he specifically testified to the fact that the petitioners were never asked to move or to leave the store. Nor did the witness elaborate on the basis of his fear except to state that 'it isn't customary for the two races to sit together and eat together.'24 In addition, there is no evidence that this alleged fear was ever communicated to the arresting officers, either at the time the manager made the initial call to police headquarters or when the police arrived at the store. Under these circumstances, the manager's general statement gives no support for the convictions within the meaning of Thompson v. City of Louisville, supra.\n\n\n36\nSubsequent to the manager's notification, the police arrived at the store and, without consulting the manager or anyone else on the premises, went directly to confront the petitioners. An officer asked the petitioners to leave the counter because 'they were disturbing the peace and violating the law by sitting there.' One of the students stated that she wished to get a glass of iced tea, but she and her friends were told, again by the police, that they were disturbing the peace by sitting at a counter reserved for whites and that they would have to leave. When the petitioners continued to occupy the seats, they were arrested, as the officer testified, for disturbing the peace '(b)y sitting there' 'because that place was reserved for white people.' The same officer testified that the petitioners had done nothing other than take seats at that particular lunch counter which he considered to be a breach of the peace.25\n\n\n37\nThe respondent discusses at length the history of race relations and the high degree of racial segregation which exists throughout the South. Although there is no reference to such facts in the records, the respondent argues that the trial court took judicial notice of the general situation, as he may do under Louisiana law,26 and that it therefore became apparent to the court that the petitioners' presence at the lunch counters might cause a disturbance which it was the duty of the police to prevent. There is nothing in the records to indicate that the trial judge did in fact take judicial notice of anything. To extend the doctrine of judicial notice to the length pressed by the respondent would require us to allow the prosecution to do through argument to this Court what it is required by due process to do at the trial, and would be 'to turn the doctrine into a pretext for dispensing with a trial.' Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Utilities Comm., 301 U.S. 292, 302, 57 S.Ct. 724, 729, 81 L.Ed. 1093. Furthermore, unless an accused is informed at the trial of the facts of which the court is taking judicial notice, not only does he not know upon what evidence he is being convicted, but, in addition, he is deprived of any opportunity to challenge the deductions drawn from such notice or to dispute the notoriety or truth of the facts allegedly relied upon. Moreover, there is no way by which an appellate court may review the facts and law of a case and intelligently decide whether the findings of the lower court are supported by the evidence where that evidence is unknown. Such an assumption would be a denial of due process. Ohio Bell, supra.\n\n\n38\nThus, having shown that these records contain no evidence to support a finding that petitioners disturbed the peace, either by outwardly boisterous conduct or by passive conduct likely to cause a public disturbance, we hold that these convictions violated petitioners' rights to due process of law guaranteed them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The undisputed evidence shows that the police who arrested the petitioners were left with nothing to support their actions except their own opinions that it was a breach of the peace for the petitioners to sit peacefully in a place where custom decreed they should not sit.27 Such activity, in the circumstances of these cases, is not evidence of any crime and cannot be so considered either by the police or by the courts.\n\n\n39\nThe judgments are reversed.\n\n\n40\nMr. Justice FRANKFURTER, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n41\nWhether state statutes are to be construed one way or another is a question of state law, final decision of which rests, of course, with the courts of the State. When as here those courts have not spelled out the meaning of a statute, this Court must extrapolate its allowable meaning and attribute that to the highest court of the State. We must do so in a manner that affords the widest latitude to state legislative power consistent with the United States Constitution.\n\n\n42\nSince LSA\u2014R.S. 14:103 is concededly a statute aimed at 'disturbing the peace,' we begin with the breadth of meaning derived from that phrase in Town of Ponchatoula v. Bates, 173 La. 824, 138 So. 851, 852 (1931). To be sure, that amounted to an abstract discussion and in the limited circumstances considered by the Louisiana Supreme Court in State v. Sanford, 203 La. 961, 14 So.2d 778 (1943), the allowable scope of the statutory prohibition was not fully explored. But construction of the statute to prohibit non-violent, non-religious behavior in a private shop when that behavior has a tendency to disturb or alarm the public is fairly derivable from a reading of the Sanford opinion.\n\n\n43\nThe action of the Louisiana Legislature in amending its statutes after the events now under review took place is not a safe or even relevant guide to the scope of the prior statute. Legislatures not uncommonly seek to make prior law more explicit or reiterate a prohibition by more emphatic concreteness. The rule of evidence that excludes proof of post-injury repairs offers a useful analogy here. See II Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 283 (Third ed. 1940). It is not our province to limit the meaning of a state statute beyond its confinement by reasonably read statecourt rulings.\n\n\n44\nAssuming for present purposes the constitutionality of a statute prohibiting non-violent activity that tends to provoke public alarm or disturbance, such a tendency, as a crucial element of a criminal offense, must be established by evidence disclosed in the record to sustain a conviction. A judge's private knowledge, or even 'knowledge by notoriety,' to use Dean Wigmore's phrase, IX Evidence, \u00a7 2569 (Third ed. 1940), not presented as part of the prosecution's case capable of being met by a defendant, is not an adequate basis, as a matter of due process, to establish an essential element of what is punished as crime. Thompson v. City of Louisville, 362 U.S. 199, 80 S.Ct. 624, 4 L.Ed.2d 654.\n\n\n45\nIt may be unnecessary to require formal proof, even as to an issue crucial in determining guilt in a criminal prosecution, of what is incontestably obvious. But some showing cannot be dispensed with when an inference is at all doubtful. And it begs the whole question on the answer to which the validity of these convictions turns to assume that the 'public' tended to be alarmed by the conduct of the petitioners here disclosed. See Devlin, L.J., in Dingle v. Associated Newspapers, (1961) 2 Q.B. 162, 198. Conviction under this Louisiana statute cannot be sustained by reliance merely upon likely consequences in the generality of cases. Since particular persons are being sent to jail for conduct allegedly having a particular effect on a particular occasion under particular circumstances, it becomes necessary to appraise that conduct and effect by the particularity of evidence adduced.\n\n\n46\nThe records in these cases, whatever variance in unimportant details they may show, contain no evidence of disturbance or alarm in the behavior of the cafe employees or customers or even passers-by, the relevant 'public' fairly in contemplation of these charges. What they do show was aptly summarized both in the testimony of the arresting police and in the recitation of the trial judge as the 'mere presence' of the petitioners.\n\n\n47\nSilent persistence in sitting after service is refused could no doubt conceivably exacerbate feelings to the boiling point. It is not fanciful speculation, however, that a proprietor who invites trade in most parts of his establishment and restricts it in another may change his policy when non-violently challenged.* With records as barren as these of evidence from which a tendency to disturb or alarm the public immediately involved can be drawn, there is nothing before us on which to sustain such an inference from what may be hypothetically lodged in the unopened bosom of the local court.\n\n\n48\nSince the 'mere presence' that these records prove has, in any event, not been made a crime by the Louisiana statute under which these petitioners were charged, their convictions must be reversed.\n\n\n49\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, concurring.\n\n\n50\nIf these cases had arisen in the Pacific Northwest\u2014the area I know best\u2014I could agree with the opinion of the Court. For while many communities north and south, east and west, at times have racial problems, those areas which have never known segregation would not be inflamed or aroused by the presence of a member of a minority race in a restaurant. But in Louisiana racial problems have agitated the people since the days of slavery. The landmark case of Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 1144, 41 L.Ed. 256\u2014the decision that announced in 1896 the now-repudiated doctrine of 'separate but equal' facilities for whites and blacks\u2014came from Louisiana which had enacted in 1890 a statute requiring segregation of the races on railroad trains. In the environment of a segregated community I can understand how the mere presence of a Negro at a white lunch counter might inflame some people as much as fisticuffs would in other places. For the reasons stated by Mr. Justice HARLAN in these cases, I read the Louisiana opinions as meaning that this law includes 'peaceful conduct of a kind that foreseeably may lead to public disturbance'\u2014a kind of 'generally known condition' that may be 'judicially noticed' even in a criminal case.\n\n\n51\nThis does not mean that the police were justified in making these arrests. For the police are supposed to be on the side of the Constitution, not on the side of discrimination. Yet if all constitutional questions are to be put aside and the problem treated merely in terms of disturbing the peace, I would have difficulty in reversing these judgments. I think, however, the constitutional questions must be reached and that they make reversal necessary.\n\n\n52\nRestaurants, whether in a drugstore, department store, or bus terminal, are a part of the public life of most of our communities. Though they are private enterprises, they are public facilities in which the States may not enforce a policy of racial segregation.\n\nI.\n\n53\nIt is, of course, state action that is prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment, not the actions of individuals. So far as the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned, individuals can be as prejudiced and intolerant as they like. They may as a consequence subject themselves to suits for assault, battery, or trespass. But those actions have no footing in the Federal Constitution. The line of for-bidden conduct marked by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is crossed only when a State makes prejudice or intolerance its policy and enforces it, as held in the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 3 S.Ct. 18, 27 L.Ed. 835. Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the Court, said: '* * * civil rights, such as are guaranteed by the constitution against state aggression, cannot be impaired by the wrongful acts of individuals, unsupported by state authority in the shape of laws, customs, or judicial or executive proceedings.' Id., at 17, 3 S.Ct. at 25. (Italics added.)\n\n\n54\nState policy violative of the Fourteenth Amendment may be expressed in Legislative enactments that permit or require segregation of the races in public places or public facilities (Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873) or in residential areas. Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U.S. 60, 38 S.Ct. 16, 62 L.Ed. 149.\n\n\n55\nIt may be expressed through executive action, as where the police or other law enforcement officials act pursuant to, or under color of, state law. See, e.g., Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495; Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492.\n\n\n56\nIt may be expressed through the administrative action of state agencies in leasing public facilities. Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45.\n\n\n57\nIt may result from judicial action, as where members of a race are systematically excluded from juries (Hernandez v. State of Texas, 347 U.S. 475, 74 S.Ct. 667, 98 L.Ed. 866), or where restrictive covenants based on race are enforced by the judiciary (Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249, 73 S.Ct. 1031, 97 L.Ed. 1586), or where a state court fines or imprisons a person for asserting his federal right to use the facilities of an interstate bus terminal, Boynton v. Com. of Virginia, 364 U.S. 454, 81 S.Ct. 182, 5 L.Ed.2d 206.\n\n\n58\nAs noted, Mr. Justice Bradley suggested in the Civil Rights Cases, supra, that state policy may be as effectively expressed in customs as informal legislative, executive, or judicial action.\n\n\n59\nIt was indeed held in Baldwin v. Morgan, 5 Cir., 287 F.2d 750, 756, that the 'custom, practice and usage' of a city and its police in arresting four Negroes for using 'white' waiting rooms was state action in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, even though no ordinance was promulgated and no order issued. In the instant cases such an inference can be drawn from the totality of circumstances permeating the environment where the arrests were made\u2014not an isolated arrest but three arrests; not arrests on account of fisticuffs but arrests because the defendants were Negroes seeking restaurant service at counters and tables reserved for 'whites.'\n\n\n60\nThere is a deep-seated pattern of segregation of the races in Louisiana,1 going back at least to Plessy v. Ferguson, supra. It was restated in 1960\u2014the year in which petitioners were arrested and charged for sitting in white restaurants\u2014by Act No. 630, which in its preamble states:\n\n\n61\n'WHEREAS, Louisiana has always maintained a policy of      segregation of the races, and 'WHEREAS, it is the intention of the citizens of this           sovereign state that such a policy be continued.'           La.Acts 1960, p. 1200.\n\n\n62\nLouisiana requires that all circuses, shows, and tent exhibitions to which the public is invited have one entrance for whites and one for Negroes. LSA\u2014R.S. c. 4, \u00a7 5. No dancing, social functions, entertainment, athletic training, games, sports, contests 'and other such activities involving personal and social contacts' may be open to both races. LSA\u2014R.S. c. 4, \u00a7 451. Any public entertainment or athletic contest must provide separate seating arrangements and separate sanitary drinking water and 'any other facilities' for the two races. LSA\u2014R.S. c. 4, \u00a7 452. Marriage between members of the two races is banned. LSA\u2014R.S. c. 14, \u00a7 79. Segregation by race is required in prisons. LSA\u2014R.S. c. 15, \u00a7 752. The blind must be segregated. LSA\u2014R.S.. c. 17, \u00a7 10. Teachers in public schools are barred from advocating desegregation of the races in the public school system. LSA\u2014R.S. c. 17, \u00a7\u00a7 443, 462. So are other state employees. LSA\u2014R.S. c. 17, \u00a7 523. Segregation on trains is required. LSA\u2014R.S. c. 45, \u00a7\u00a7 528 532. Common carriers of passengers must provide separate waiting rooms and reception room facilities for the two races (LSA\u2014R.S. c. 45, \u00a7 1301) and separate toilets and separate facilities for drinking water as well. LSA\u2014R.S. c. 45, \u00a7 1303. Employers must provide separate sanitary facilities for the two races. LSA\u2014R.S. 23:971. Employers must also provide separate eating places in separate rooms and separate eating and drinking utensils for members of the two races. LSA\u2014R.S. c. 23, \u00a7 972. Persons of one race may not establish their residence in a community of another race without approval of the majority of the other race. LSA\u2014R.S. c. 33, \u00a7 5066. Court dockets must reveal the race of the parties in divorce actions. LSA\u2014R.S. c. 13, \u00a7 917. And all public parks, recreation centers, playgrounds, community centers and 'other such facilities at which swimming, dancing, golfing, skating or other recreational activities are conducted' must be segregated. LSA\u2014R.S. c. 33, \u00a7 4558.1.\n\n\n63\nThough there may have been no state law or municipal ordinance that in terms required segregation of the races in restaurants, it is plain that the proprietors in the instant cases were segregating blacks from whites pursuant to Louisiana's custom. Segregation is basic to the structure of Louisiana as a community; the custom that maintains it is at least as powerful as any law. If these proprietors also choose segregation, their preference does not make the action 'private,' rather than 'state,' action. If it did, a minuscule of private prejudice would convert state into private action. Moreover, where the segregation policy is the policy of a State, it matters not that the agency to enforce it is a private enterprise. Baldwin v. Morgan, supra; Boman v. Birmingham Transit Co., 5 Cir., 280 F.2d 531.\n\nII.\n\n64\nIt is my view that a State may not constitutionally enforce a policy of segregation in restaurant facilities. Some of the argument assumed that restaurants are 'private' property in the sense that one's home is 'private' property. They are, of course, 'private' property for many purposes of the Constitution. Yet so are street railways, power plants, warehouses, and other types of enterprises which have long been held to be affected with a public interest. Where constitutional rights are involved, the proprietary interests of individuals must give way. Towns, though wholly owned by private interests, perform municipal functions and are held to the same constitutional requirements as ordinary municipalities. Marsh v. State of Alabama, 326 U.S. 501, 66 S.Ct. 276, 90 L.Ed. 265. State regulation of private enterprise falls when it discriminates against interstate commerce. Port Richmond Ferry v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of Hudson County, 234 U.S. 317, 34 S.Ct. 821, 58 L.Ed. 1330. State regulation of private enterprise that results in impairment of other constitutional rights should stand on no firmer footing, at least in the area where facilities of a public nature are involved.\n\n\n65\nLong before Chief Justice Waite wrote the opinion in Munn v. State of Illinois, 94 U.S. 113, 24 L.Ed. 77, holding that the prices charged by grain warehouses could be regulated by the State, a long list of businesses had been held to be 'affected with a public interest.' Among these were ferries, common carriers, hackmen, bakers, millers, wharfingers, and innkeepers. Id., at 125. The test used in Munn v. State of Illinois was stated as follows: 'Property does become clothed with a public interest when used in a manner to make it of public consequence, and affect the community at large.' Id., at 126. In reply to the charge that price regulation deprived the warehousemen of property, Chief Justice Waite stated, 'There is no attempt to compel these owners to grant the public an interest in their property, but to declare their obligations, if they use it in this particular manner.' Id., at 133.\n\n\n66\nThere was a long span between Munn v. Illinois and Nebbia v. People of State of New York, 291 U.S. 502, 54 S.Ct. 505, 78 L.Ed. 940, which upheld the power of a State to fix the price of milk. A business may have a 'public interest' even though it is not a 'public utility' in the accepted sense, even though it enjoys no franchise from the State, and even though it enjoys no monopoly. Id., at 534, 54 S.Ct. at 514. The examples cover a wide range from price control to prohibition of certain types of business. Id., at 525\u2014529, 54 S.Ct. at 510\u2014512. Various systems or devices designed by States or municipalities to protect the wholesomeness of food in the interests of health are deep-seated as any exercise of the police power. Adams v. City of Milwaukee, 228 U.S. 572, 33 S.Ct. 610, 57 L.Ed. 971.\n\n\n67\nYears ago Lord Chief Justice Hale stated in De Portibus Maris, 1 Harg. Law Tracts 78, '* * * if a man set out a street in new building on his own land, it is now no longer bare private interest, but is affected with a public interest.' Those who run a retail establishment under permit from a municipality operate, in my view, a public facility in which there can be no more discrimination based on race than is constitutionally permissible in the more customary types of public facility.\n\n\n68\nUnder Louisiana law, restaurants are a form of private property affected with a public interest. Local boards of health are given broad powers. LSA\u2014R.S. c. 40, \u00a7 35; LSA\u2014R.S. c. 33, \u00a7 621. The City of Baton Rouge in its City Code requires all restaurants to have a permit. Tit. 6, c. 7, \u00a7 601. The Director of Public Health is given broad powers of inspection and permits issued can be suspended. Id. \u00a7 603. Permits are not transferable. Id. \u00a7 606. One who operates without a permit commits a separate offense each day a violation occurs. Id. \u00a7 604. Moreover, detailed provisions are made concerning the equipment that restaurants must have, the protection of ready-to-eat foods and drink, and the storage of food. Id. \u00a7 609.\n\n\n69\nRestaurants, though a species of private property, are in the public domain. Or to paraphrase the opinion in Nebbia v. New York, supra, restaurants in Louisiana have a 'public consequence' and 'affect the community at large.' 291 U.S. 502, 533, 54 S.Ct. 505, 514, 78 L.Ed. 940.\n\n\n70\nWhile the concept of a business 'affected with a public interest' normally is used as a measure of a State's police power over it, it also has other consequences. A State may not require segregation of the races in conventional public utilities any more than it can segregate them in ordinary public facilities.2 As stated by the court in Boman v. Birmingham Transit Co., 5 Cir., 280 F.2d 531, 535, a public utility 'is doing something the state deems useful for the public necessity or convenience.' It was this idea that the first Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting in Plessy v. Ferguson, supra, advanced. Though a common carrier is private enterprise, 'its work,' he maintained, is public. Id., at 554, 16 S.Ct. at 1144. And there can be no difference, in my view, between one kind of business that is regulated in the public interest and another kind so far as the problem of racial segregation is concerned. I do not believe that a State that licenses a business can license it to serve only whites or only blacks or only yellows or only browns. Race is an impermissible classification when it comes to parks or other municipal facilities by reason of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. By the same token, I do not see how a State can constitutionally exercise its licensing power over business either in terms or in effect to segregate the races in the licensed premises. The authority to license a business for public use is derived from the public. Negroes are as much a part of that public as are whites. A municipality granting a license to operate a business for the public represents Negroes as well as all other races who live there. A license to establish a restaurant is a license to establish a public facility and necessarily imports, in law, equality of use for all members of the public. I see no way whereby licenses issued by a State to serve the public can be distinguished from leases of public facilities (Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, supra) for that end.\n\n\n71\nOne can close the doors of his home to anyone he desires. But one who operates an enterprise under a license from the government enjoys a privilege that derives from the people. Whether retail stores, not licensed by the municipality, stand on a different footing is not presented here. But the necessity of a license shows that the public has rights in respect to those premises. The business is not a matter of mere private concern. Those who license enterprises for public use should not have under our Constitution the power to license it for the use of only one race. For there is the overriding constitutional requirement that all state power be exercised so as not to deny equal protection to any group. As the first Mr. Justice Harlan stated in dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson, supra, at 559, 16 S.Ct. at 1146, '* * * in view of the constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. There is no caste here. Our constitution is color-blind * * *.'\n\n\n72\nMr. Justice HARLAN, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n73\nI agree that these convictions are unconstitutional, but not for the reasons given by the Court. Relying on Thompson v. City of Louisville, 362 U.S. 199, 80 S.Ct. 624, 4 L.Ed.2d 654, the Court strikes down the convictions on the ground that there is no evidence whatever to support them. In my opinion the Thompson doctrine does not fit these cases. However, I believe the convictions are vulnerable under the Fourteenth Amendment on other grounds: (1) the kind of conduct revealed in Garner, No. 26, and in Hoston, No. 28, could not be punished under a generalized breach of the peace provision, such as Art. 103(7), La.Crim. Code;1 (2) Art. 103(7) as applied in Briscoe, No. 27 (as well as in the Garner and Hoston cases) is unconstitutionally vague and uncertain.\n\n\n74\nThe Court's reversal for lack of evidence rests on two different views of Art. 103(7). First, it is said that the statute, as construed by the Louisiana courts, reaches at most only 'violent,' 'boisterous,' or 'outwardly provocative' conduct that may foreseeably induce a public disturbance. On this view, these cases are found evidentially wanting because the petitioners' conduct, being entirely peaceful, was not of the character proscribed by the statute so construed. Alternatively, it is recognized that the statute is susceptible of a construction that would embrace as well other kinds of conduct having the above effect. On that view, the convictions are also found evidentially deficient, in that petitioners' conduct, so it is said, could not property be taken as having any tendency to cause a public disturbance. In my opinion, the first of these holdings cannot withstand analysis with appropriate regard for the limitations upon our powers of review over state criminal cases; the second holding rests on untenable postulates as to the law of evidence.\n\nI.\n\n75\nTurning to the first holding, it goes without saying that we are not at liberty to determine for ourselves the scope of this Louisiana statute. That was a function belonging exclusively to the state courts, and their interpretation is binding on us. E.g., Appleyard v. State of Massachusetts, 203 U.S. 222, 227, 27 S.Ct. 122, 123, 51 L.Ed. 161; Hebert v. State of Louisiana, 272 U.S. 312, 316, 47 S.Ct. 103, 104, 71 L.Ed. 270; Williams v. Oklahoma, 358 U.S. 576, 583, 79 S.Ct. 421, 425, 3 L.Ed.2d 516. For me, the Court's view that the statute covers only nonpeaceful conduct is unacceptable, since I believe that the Louisiana Supreme Court decided the opposite in these very cases. I think the State Supreme Court's refusal to review these convictions, taken in light of its assertion that the 'rulings of the district judge on matters of law are not erroneous,' must be accepted as an authoritative and binding state determination that the petitioners' activities, as revealed in these records, did violate the statute; in other words that, contrary to what this Court now says in Part I of its opinion, the enactment does cover peaceful conduct of a kind that foreseeably may lead to public disturbance.2\n\n\n76\nThis Court's view of the statute rests primarily, if not entirely, on an earlier Louisiana case, State v. Sanford, 203 La. 961, 14 So.2d 778, involving a different, but comparable, breach of the peace statute. That case is regarded as establishing that breaches of the peace under Louisiana law are confined to nonpeaceful conduct. While I do not find the Sanford case as 'plan' as the Court does (infra, 368 U.S., pp. 191\u2014192, 82 S.Ct., pp. 266\u2014267), that earlier holding cannot in any event be deemed controlling on the significance to be attributed to the action of the State Supreme Court in these cases. There can be no doubt that Louisiana had to follow the principles of Sanford only to the extent that it felt bound by stare decisis. A departure from precedent may have been wrong, unwise, or even unjust, but it was not unconstitutional. Patterson v. State of Colorado, 205 U.S. 454, 461, 27 S.Ct. 556, 557, 51 L.Ed. 879.3 See also Brinkerhoff-Faris Trust & Savings Co. v. Hill, 281 U.S. 673, 680, 50 S.Ct. 451, 454, 74 L.Ed. 1107, and cases there cited; cf. Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., 287 U.S. 358, 364, 53 S.Ct. 145, 148, 77 L.Ed. 360.\n\n\n77\nMore basically, established principles of constitutional adjudication require us to consider that the Louisiana Supreme Court's refusal to review these cases signifies a holding that the breach of the peace statute which controls these cases does embrace the conduct of the petitioners, peaceful though it was.\n\n\n78\nThese state judgments come to us armored with a presumption that they are not founded 'otherwise than is required by the fundamental law of the land,' Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241, 252, 6 S.Ct. 734, 740, 29 L.Ed. 868 (see also Darr v. Burford, 339 U.S. 200, 205, 70 S.Ct. 587, 590, 94 L.Ed. 761), comparable to the presumption which has always attached to state legislative enactments. See, e.g., Butler v. Pennsylvania, 10 How, 402, 415, 13 L.Ed. 472. That presumption should render impermissible an interpretation of these judgments as resting on the view that the relevant breach of the peace statute reaches only unruly behavior. For, on the Court's premise that there is no evidence of that kind of behavior, such an interpretation in effect attributes to the Louisiana Supreme Court a deliberately unconstitutional decision, under principles established by Thompson v. City of Louisville, supra, which had already been decided at the time these cases came before the Louisiana courts.\n\n\n79\nMoreover, the kind of speculation in which the Court has indulged as to the meaning of the Louisiana statute is surely out of keeping with the principle that federal courts should abstain from constitutional decision involving doubtful state law questions until a clarifying adjudication on them has first been obtained from the state courts. See Railroad Comm. of Texas v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 500, 61 S.Ct. 643, 645, 85 L.Ed. 971; Harrison v. N.A.A.C.P., 360 U.S. 167, 79 S.Ct. 1025, 3 L.Ed.2d 1152. Cf. Glenn v. Field Packing Co., 290 U.S. 177, 54 S.Ct. 138, 78 L.Ed. 252; Leiter Minerals, Inc., v. United States, 352 U.S. 220, 228\u2014229, 77 S.Ct. 287, 292, 1 L.Ed.2d 267; Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux, 360 U.S. 25, 79 S.Ct. 1070, 3 L.Ed.2d 1058. If there be doubt as to how the statute was construed in this respect, the cases should be returned to the Louisiana Supreme Court for clarification of its judgments. See Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U.S. 117, 65 S.Ct. 459, 89 L.Ed. 789.\n\n\n80\nOur recent decision in Thompson v. City of Louisville, 362 U.S. 199, 80 S.Ct. 624, 4 L.Ed.2d 654, cannot well be taken as justification for considering the judgments under review as other than a holding by Louisiana's highest court that breach of the peace under then existing state law may include conduct that in itself is peaceful. In Thompson, the petitioner was convicted of two offenses defined by ordinances of the City of Louisville. One of these ordinances, prohibiting loitering, expressly enumerated three elements of the offense. The prosecution introduced no evidence to establish any of these definitely prescribed components, which were not suggested to have, by virtue of state judicial interpretation, any other than their plain meaning. We held that 'Under the words of the ordinance itself,' there was no evidence to support the conviction.\n\n\n81\nThe other offense of which the petitioner in Thompson was convicted was 'disorderly conduct,' not at all defined in the ordinance. The only evidence in the record relating to conduct which might conceivably have come within the prohibited scope indicated was that the petitioner was 'argumentative' with the arresting officers. We said of this conviction (362 U.S., at 206, 80 S.Ct., at 629): 'We assume, for we are justified in assuming, that merely 'arguing' with a policeman is not, because it could not be, 'disorderly conduct' as a matter of the substantive law of Kentucky. See Lanzetta v. State of New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 59 S.Ct. 618, 83 L.Ed. 888.' In other words, we held that the ordinance could not, for want of adequate notice, constitutionally be construed by the Kentucky courts to cover the activity for which the city sought to punish the petitioner.\n\n\n82\nWhere, as was true of the disorderly conduct charge in Thompson, application of a generally drawn state statute or municipal ordinance to the conduct of a defendant would require a constitutionally impermissible construction of the enactment, we are not bound by the state court's finding that the conduct was criminal. In the cases now before us, however, the Court does not suggest that Louisiana's disturbance of the peace statute was too vague to be constitutionally applied to the conduct of the petitioners. I think we are obliged, because of the state courts' dispositions of these cases, to hold that there was presented at petitioners' trials evidence of criminal conduct under Louisiana law. Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U.S. 242, 255, 57 S.Ct. 732, 738, 81 L.Ed. 1066.\n\n\n83\nThompson v. Louisville should be recognized for what it is, a case involving a situation which, I think it fair to say, was unique in the annals of the Court. The case is bound to lead us into treacherous territory, unless we apply its teaching with the utmost circumspection, and with due sense of the limitations upon our reviewing authority.\n\n\n84\nThe Court's holding on this phase of the matter also suffers from additional infirmities. I do not think that State v. Sanford, the cornerstone of this branch of the Court's opinion, is as revealing upon the meaning of breach of the peace under Louisiana law as the Court would make it seem. In that case the Louisiana Supreme Court reversed the convictions, under the then breach of the peace statute, of four Jehovah's Witnesses who had solicited contributions and distributed pamphlets in a Louisiana town, with an opinion which cited, inter alia, Cantwell v. State of Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1214 and Martin v. City of Struthers, 319 U.S. 141, 63 S.Ct. 862, 87 L.Ed. 1119. Reference was made to 'the provisions of the Constitution of the United States guaranteeing freedom of religion, of the press and of speech.' 203 La., at 968, 14 So.2d, at 780. The court said, most clearly, 'The application of the statute by the trial judge to the facts of this case and his construction thereof would render it unconstitutional under the above Federal authorities.' 203 La., at 970, 14 So.2d, at 780\u2014781. In addition, the opinion noted, conviction under the statute might violate the Louisiana Constitution 'because it is well-settled that no act or conduct, however reprehensible, is a crime in Louisiana, unless it is defined and made a crime clearly and unmistakably by statute.' 203 La., at 970, 14 So.2d, at 781. In the concluding part of its opinion the Louisiana Supreme Court also said what this Court now considers to be the sole ground of its decision: 'It is our opinion that the statute is inapplicable to this case because it appears that the defendants did not commit any unlawful act or pursue an unlawful or disorderly course of conduct which would tend to disturb the peace.' 203 La., at 970, 14 So.2d, at 781.\n\n\n85\nThus, a full reading of Sanford will disclose that there were at least three considerations which led to the result: (1) the likelihood that a contrary holding would violate provisions of the Federal Constitution relating to religion, speech, and press under the principles declared in then-recent decisions of this Court; (2) the possibility that the statute was too vague and unclear under the Louisiana Constitution adequately to define the bounds of the conduct being declared criminal; (3) the unfairness of convicting under a general breach of the peace statute persons engaged in such peaceable religious activity.\n\n\n86\nThe Court now isolates this last factor from this multifaceted opinion, and, using it as an immutable measures of what Louisiana law requires, declares that the present convictions must fall because the standard so unclearly set out in Sanford has not been met. Apart from other considerations already discussed, I am not prepared to rest a constitutional decision on so insecure a foundation.\n\n\n87\nIt is further significant that the State Supreme Court's order refusing to review the present cases does not cite State v. Sanford, but rather relies on another earlier case, Town of Ponchatoula v. Bates, 173 La. 824, 138 So. 851. The Bates decision, upholding the constitutionality of an ordinance making it a crime 'to engage in a fight or in any manner disturb the Peace,' defined disturbance of the peace as 'any act or conduct of a person which molests the inhabitants in the enjoyment of that peace and quiet to which they are entitled, or which throws into confusion things settled, or which causes excitement, unrest, disquietude, or fear among persons of ordinary, normal temperament.' 173 La., at 828, 138 So., at 852. Such a definition would of course bring within the compass of the statute even peaceful activity, so long as it threw 'into confusion things settled,' or caused disquietude among ordinary members of the community. I think it was that construction which the Louisiana Supreme Court placed upon the breach of the peace statute involved in the cases now before us.\n\nII.\n\n88\nThe alternative holding of the Court in Part II of its opinion also stands on unsolid foundations. Conceding that this breach of the peace statute 'might' be construed to cover peaceful conduct carried on 'in such a manner as would foreseeably disturb or alarm the public,' the Court holds that there was no evidence that petitioners' conduct tended to disturb or alarm those who witnessed their activity.\n\n\n89\nThere is, however, more to these cases than what physically appears in the record. It is an undisputed fact that the 'sit-in' program, of which petitioners' demonstrations were a part, had caused considerable racial tension in various States, including Louisiana. Under Louisiana law, LSA\u2014R.S. 15:422, Louisiana courts may take judicial notice of 'the political, social and racial conditions prevailing in this state.' State v. Bessa, 115 La. 259, 38 So. 985. This Court holds, nonetheless, that the Louisiana courts could not, consistently with the procedural guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment, judicially notice the undisputed fact that there was racial tension in and around Baton Rouge on March 28 and 29, 1960 (the dates of these 'sitin'), without informing the parties that such notice was being taken, and without spreading the source of the information on the record.\n\n\n90\nSupport for this constitutional proposition is found in Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 301 U.S. 292, 302\u2014303, 57 S.Ct. 724, 730, 81 L.Ed. 1093. The Court there held that it was repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment for a state agency to deprive the telephone company of property on the basis of rates set by a precise mathematical computation derived from undisclosed statistics. This was because the procedure afforded no opportunity for rebuttal with respect to the underlying data, and for possible demonstration that the figures should not be judicially noticed, since their source was unknown and the statistics were not disclosed to any reviewing court. See Morgan, Some Problems of Proof (1956), 56.\n\n\n91\nThe situation we have here is quite different. The existence of racial tensions, of which the Louisiana courts must have taken judicial notice in order to find that petitioners' conduct alarmed or disturbed the public, was notorious throughout the community and, indeed, throughout that part of the United States. The truth of that proposition is not challenged, nor is any particular authority required to confirm it. This kind of generally known condition may be judicially noticed by trial and appellate courts without prior warning to the parties, since it does not require any foundation establishing the accuracy of a specific source of information. See Uniform Rules of Evidence, 9(2)(c); ALI, Model Code of Evidence, Rule 802(c); 1 Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence (1954), 9\u201410. Cf. Mills v. Denver Tramway Corp., 155 F.2d 808 (C.A.10th Cir.). I perceive no reason why that principle should be considered as applying only in civil cases, and I am not aware of any American authority which so holds.\n\n\n92\nIndeed, the fact of which I think we must consider judicial notice was taken in this instance was so notorious throughout the country that far from its being unconstitutional for a court to take it into consideration, it would be quite amiss for us not to deem that the Louisiana courts did so on their own initiative. See, e.g., Uniform Rule of Evidence, 9(1); cf. Note, 12 Va.L.Rev. 154 (1925), and cases there cited. It might have been procedurally preferable had the trial judge announced to the parties that he was taking judicial notice, as is suggested in Model Code of Evidence, Rule 804. But we would be exalting the sheerest of technicalities were we to hold that a conviction is constitutionally void because of a judge's failure to declare that he has noticed a common proposition when, at no stage in the proceeding, is it suggested that the proposition may be untrue. Whether a trial judge need notify the parties of his intention to take judicial notice of 'routine matters of common knowledge which * * * (he) would notice as a matter of course' is best left to his 'reasonable discretion.' McCormick, Evidence (1954), 708. Appellate courts have always reserved the authority to notice such commonly known propositions as are needed to support the judgment of a lower court, even if no express reference has been made below. See, Comment, 42 Mich.L.Rev. 509, 512\u2014513 (1943).\n\n\n93\nMoreover, in this instance, the fact that the trial court had taken judicial notice of the impact of petitioners' conduct, which indeed had obviously been engaged in for the very purpose of producing an impact on others in this field of racial relations, albeit, I shall assume, with the best of motives, could hardly have failed to cross the minds of petitioners' counsel before the trial had ended. They however neither sought to introduce countervailing evidence on that issue, nor have they undertaken at any stage of these proceedings, including that in this Court, to question the availability of judicial notice on this aspect of the State's case.\n\n\n94\nWere we to follow the reasoning of the majority opinion where it would logically lead, this Court would be violating due process every time it noticed a generally known fact without first calling in the parties to apprise them of its intention. Yet without any such notification this Court has many times taken judicial notice of well-known economic and social facts, e.g., Atchison, Topeka & S.F.R. Co. v. United States, 284 U.S. 248, 260, 52 S.Ct. 146, 149, 76 L.Ed. 273; West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379, 398 400, 57 S.Ct. 578, 585, 81 L.Ed. 703; Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.S. 57, at p. 62, 82 S.Ct. 159, at p. 163, and even of the tendency of particular epithets to cause a breach of the peace. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 574, 62 S.Ct. 766, 770, 86 L.Ed. 1031.\n\n\n95\nIt is no answer to say in these cases that while it was permissible for the Louisiana courts to take judicial notice of racial conditions generally, they could not take notice of the particular conditions on the premises involved in these prosecutions. In the absence of contrary evidence, it was certainly not constitutionally impermissible for the Louisiana courts to consider that the racial conditions in Baton Rouge and in the establishments where petitioners sat were not dissimilar to those existing throughout the State. Judicial notice of racial conditions in a State has sufficient probative value in determining what were the racial conditions at a particular location within the State to withstand constitutional attack. Reversing these convictions for want of evidence of racial tension would in effect be putting this Court into the realm of reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support these convictions, something which both Thompson v. City of Louisville, supra, 362 U.S., at 199, 80 S.Ct. at 624, and the Court's opinion in the present cases, ante, 368 U.S., p. 163, 82 S.Ct., p. 251, recognize is not properly within our purview.\n\n\n96\nIn my opinion, skimpy though these records are, the convictions do not fall for want of evidence, in the constitutional sense.\n\nIII.\n\n97\nWere there no more to these cases, I should have to vote to affirm. But in light of principles established by Cantwell v. State of Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1214, and consistently since recognized, I think the convictions are subject to other constitutional infirmities.\n\n\n98\nAt the outset it is important to focus on the precise factual situation in each of these cases. Common to all three are the circumstances that petitioners were given the invitation extended to the public at large to patronize these establishments; that they were told that they could be served food only at the Negro lunch counters; that their conduct was not unruly or offensive; and that none of them was ever asked by the owners or their agents to leave the establishments. While in Briscoe, No. 27, there was some very slight, but in my view constitutionally adequate, evidence that those petitioners were expressly asked 'to move' from the 'white' lunch counter,4 and undisputed evidence that they did not do so, in Garner, No. 26, and Hoston, No. 28, there was no evidence whatever of any express request to the petitioners in those cases that they move from the 'white' lunch counters where they were sitting.\n\n\n99\nNor do I think that any such request is fairly to be implied from the fact that petitioners were told by the management that they could not be served food at such counters. The premises in both instances housed merchandising establishments, a drugstore in Garner, a department store in Hoston, which solicited business from all comers to the stores I think the reasonable inference is that the management did not want to risk losing Negro patronage in the stores by requesting these petitioners to leave the 'white' lunch counters, preferring to rely on the hope that the irritations of white customers or the force of custom would drive them away from the counters.5 This view seems the more probable in circumstances when, as here, the 'sitters\" behavior was entirely quiet and courteous, and, for all we know, the counters may have been only sparsely, if to any extent, occupied by white persons.6\n\n\n100\nIn short, I believe that in the Garner and Hoston cases the records should be taken as indicating that the petitioners remained at the 'white' lunch counters with the implied consent of the management,7 even though a similar conclusion may not be warranted in the Briscoe case. Under these circumstances, applying principles announced in Cantwell, I would hold all these convictions offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment, in that: (1) in Garner and Hoston petitioners' conduct, occurring with the managements' implied consent, was a form of expression within the range of protections afforded by the Fourteenth Amendment which could in no event be punished by the State under a general breach of the peace statute; and (2) in Briscoe, while petitioners' 'sitting' over the management's objection, cannot be deemed to be within the reach of such protections, their convictions must nonetheless fall because the Louisiana statute, as there applied (and a fortiori as applied in the other two cases), was unconstitutionally vague and uncertain.\n\n\n101\nIn the Cantwell case a Jehovah's Witness had been convicted for breach of the peace under a Connecticut statute embracing what was considered to be the common-law concept of that offense.8 'The facts which were held to support the conviction * * * were that he stopped two men in the street, asked, and received, permission to play a phonograph record, and played the record 'Enemies,' which attacked the religion and church of the two men, who were Catholics. Both were incensed by the contents of the record and were tempted to strike Cantwell (the defendant) unless he went away. On being told to be on his way he left their presence. There was no evidence that he was personally offensive or entered into any argument with those he interviewed.' 310 U.S., at 302\u2014303, 60 S.Ct., at 903.\n\n\n102\nAccepting the determination of the state courts that although the defendant himself had not been disorderly or provocative, his conduct under Connecticut law nonetheless constituted a breach of the peace because of its tendency to inflame others, this Court reversed. Starting from the premise that the 'fundamental concept of liberty embodied in (the Fourteenth) Amendment embraces the liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment,' the Court found that the defendant's activities fell within the protection granted to the 'free exercise' of religion. Then recognizing the danger to such liberties of 'leaving to the executive and judicial branches too wide a discretion' in the application of a statute 'sweeping in a great variety of conduct under a general and indefinite characterization,' the Court held that the defendant's activities could not constitutionally be reached under a general breach of the peace statute, but only under one specifically and narrowly aimed at such conduct. 310 U.S., at 307\u2014308, 60 S.Ct., at 907. The Court stated:\n\n\n103\n'Although the contents of the (phonograph) record not      unnaturally aroused animosity, we think that, in the absence of a statute narrowly drawn to define and punish      specific conduct as constituting a clear and present danger      to a substantial interest of the State, the petitioner's      communication, considered in the light of the constitutional      guarantees, raised no such clear and present menace to public      peace and order as to render him liable to conviction of the      common law offense in question.' (Citing to such cases as      Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47.) 310 U.S., at 311, 60      S.Ct., at 906.\n\n\n104\nI think these principles control the Garner and Hoston cases. There was more to the conduct of those petitioners than a bare desire to remain at the 'white' lunch counter and their refusal of a police request to move from the counter. We would surely have to be blind not to recognize that petitioners were sitting at these counters, where they knew they would not be served, in order to demonstrate that their race was being segregated in dining facilities in this part of the country.\n\n\n105\nSuch a demonstration, in the circumstances of these two cases, is as much a part of the 'free trade in ideas,' Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 630, 40 S.Ct. 17, 22, 63 L.Ed. 1173 (Holmes, J., dissenting), as is verbal expression, more commonly thought of as 'speech.' It, like speech, appeals to good sense and to 'the power of reason as applied through public discussion,' Whitney v. People of State of California, 274 U.S. 357, 375, 47 S.Ct. 641, 648, 71 L.Ed. 1095 (Brandeis, J., concurring), just as much as, if not more than, a public oration delivered from a soapbox at a street corner. This Court has never limited the right to speak, a protected 'liberty' under the Fourteenth Amendment, Gitlow v. People of State of New York, 268 U.S. 652, 666, 45 S.Ct. 625, 629, 69 L.Ed. 1138, to mere verbal expression. Stromberg v. People of State of California, 283 U.S. 359, 51 S.Ct. 532, 75 L.Ed. 1117; Thornhill v. State of Alabama, 310 U.S. 88, 60 S.Ct. 736, 84 L.Ed. 1093; West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 633\u2014634, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 1183, 87 L.Ed. 1628. See also N.A.A.C.P. v. State of Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 460, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 1170, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488. If the act of displaying a red flag as a symbol of opposition to organized government is a liberty encompassed within free speech as protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, Stromberg v. California, supra, the act of sitting at a privately owned lunch counter with the consent of the owner, as a demonstration of opposition to enforced segregation, is surely within the same range of protections. This is not to say, of course, that the Fourteenth Amendment reaches to demonstrations conducted on private property over the objection of the owner (as in Briscoe), just as it would surely not encompass verbal expression in a private home if the owner has not consented.\n\n\n106\nNo one can deny the interest that a State has in preserving peace and harmony within its borders. Pursuant to this interest, a state legislature may enact a trespass statute, or a disturbance of the peace statute which either lists in detail the acts condemned by legitimate state policy or proscribes breaches of the peace generally, thus relating the offense to the already developed body of common law defining that crime. Or it may, as Louisiana has done, append to a specific enumeration in a breach of the peace statute a 'catch-all' clause to provide for unforeseen but obviously disruptive and offensive behavior which cannot be justified, and which is not within the range of constitutional protection.\n\n\n107\nBut when a State seeks to subject to criminal sanctions conduct which, except for a demonstrated paramount state interest, would be within the range of freedom of expression as assured by the Fourteenth Amendment, it cannot do so by means of a general and all-inclusive breach of the peace prohibition. It must bring the activity sought to be proscribed within the ambit of a statute or clause 'narrowly drawn to define and punish specific conduct as constituting a clear and present danger to a substantial interest of the State.' Cantwell v. Connecticut, supra, 310 U.S., at 311, 60 S.Ct., at 906; Thornhill v. State of Alabama, 310 U.S. 88, 105,9 60 S.Ct. 736, 745. And of course that interest must be a legitimate one. A State may not 'suppress free communication of views, religious or other, under the guise of conserving desirable conditions.' Cantwell, supra, at 308, 60 S.Ct. at 905.\n\n\n108\nThese limitations exist not because control of such activity is beyond the power of the State, but because sound constitutional principles demand of the state legislature that it focus on the nature of the otherwise 'protected' conduct it is prohibiting, and that it then make a legislative judgment as to whether that conduct presents so clear and present a danger to the welfare of the community that it may legitimately be criminally proscribed.10\n\n\n109\nThe Louisiana Legislature made no such judgment before the petitioners in Garner and Hoston engaged in their 'sit-in' activity. In light of the Cantwell case, whose reasoning of course cannot be deemed limited to 'expression' taking place on the public streets, cf. Terminiello v. City of Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 69 S.Ct. 894, 93 L.Ed. 1131, Niemotko v. State of Maryland, 340 U.S. 268, 281, 71 S.Ct. 325, 328, 332, 95 L.Ed. 267 (concurring opinion), Louisiana could not, in my opinion, constitutionally reach those petitioners' conduct under subsection (7)\u2014the 'catch-all clause'\u2014of its then existing disturbance of the peace statute.11 In so concluding, I intimate no view as to whether Louisiana could by a specifically drawn statute constitutionally proscribe conduct of the kind evinced in these two cases, or upon the constitutionality of the statute which the State has recently passed.12 I deal here only with these two cases, and the statute that is before us now.\n\nIV.\n\n110\nFinally, I believe that the principles of Cantwell lead to the conclusion that this general breach of the peace provision must also be deemed unconstitutional for vagueness and uncertainty, as applied in the circumstances of all these cases. As to Garner and Hoston this affords an alternative ground for reversal. As to Briscoe, where the evidence falls short of establishing that those petitioners remained at the 'white' lunch counter with the express or implied consent of the owner (notes 4, 5, supra), I would rest reversal solely on this ground.13\n\n\n111\nWhile Cantwell was not explicitly founded on that premise, it seems to me implicit in the opinion that a statute which leaves the courts in uncertainty as to whether it was intended to reach otherwise constitutionally protected conduct must by the same token be deemed inadequate warning to a defendant that his conduct has been condemned by the State. See Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 573\u2014574, 62 S.Ct. 766, 770, 86 L.Ed. 1031. Cf. Winters v. People of State of New York, 333 U.S. 507, 509\u2014510, 68 S.Ct. 665, 667, 92 L.Ed. 840; Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, 151, 80 S.Ct. 215, 217, 4 L.Ed.2d 205; Thompson v. City of Louisville, 362 U.S. 199, 206, 80 S.Ct. 624, 629, 4 L.Ed.2d 654. Such warning is, of course, a requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment. Lanzetta v. State of New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453, 59 S.Ct. 618, 619, 83 L.Ed. 888.\n\n\n112\nThis conclusion finds added support in the cases requiring of state legislatures more specificity in statutes impinging on freedom of expression than might suffice for other criminal enactments. See Winters v. People of State of New York, supra, 333 U.S., at 509\u2014510, 68 S.Ct., at 667; Smith v. California, supra, 361 U.S., at 151, 81 S.Ct., at 217; cf. Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U.S. 242, 261\u2014264, 57 S.Ct. 732, 742, 81 L.Ed. 1066. To the extent that this Louisiana statute is explicit on the subject of expression it prohibits only that which is 'unnecessarily loud, offensive, or insulting' or activity carried on 'in a violent or tumultuous manner by any three or more persons' (note 1, supra). No charge was made or proved that petitioners' conduct met any of those criteria. Nor has the statute been elucidated in this respect before, or since, petitioners' conviction, by any decision of the Louisiana courts of which we have been advised. Cf. Winters v. People of State of New York, supra, 333 U.S., at 514, 68 S.Ct., at 669; Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4, 69 S.Ct. 894, 895. Lastly, it is worth observing that in State v. Sanford the Louisiana Supreme Court seriously questioned on the score of vagueness the validity of that earlier breach of the peace statute under the State Constitution, as there applied to conduct within the same range of constitutional protection.14\n\n\n113\nIn the absence of any Louisiana statute purporting to express the State's overriding interest in prohibiting petitioners' conduct as a clear and present danger to the welfare of the community, peaceful demonstration on public streets, and on private property with the consent of the owner, was constitutionally protected as a form of expression. Louisiana's breach of the peace statute drew no distinct line between presumably constitutionally protected activity and the conduct of the petitioners in Briscoe, as a criminal trespass statute might have done.15 The fact that in Briscoe, unlike Garner and Hoston, the management did not consent to the petitioners' remaining at the 'white' lunch counter does not serve to permit the application of this general breach of the peace statute to the conduct shown in that case. For the statute by its terms appears to be as applicable to 'incidents fairly within the protection of the guarantee of free speech,' Winters v. People of State of New York, supra, 333 U.S., at 509, 68 S.Ct., at 667, as to that which is not within the range of such protection. Hence such a law gives no warning as to what may fairly be deemed to be within its compass. See Note, 109 U. of Pa.L.Rev. 67, 75\u201476, 99\u2014104 (1960).\n\n\n114\nFor the foregoing reasons I dissent from the opinion of the Court, but join in the judgment.\n\n\n\n1\n Unless otherwise indicated, the term 'petitioners' refers to the petitioners in all three cases, Nos. 26, 27 and 28.\n\n\n2\n In No. 26, Garner et al. v. Louisiana, the petitioners, two Negro students at Southern University, took seats at the lunch counter of Sitman's Drug Store in Baton Rouge, and in No. 27, Briscoe et al. v. Louisiana, the lunch counter at which the seven Negro students sought service was in the restaurant section of the Greyhound Bus Terminal in Baton Rouge.\n\n\n3\n The same is true, of course, with regard to the bus terminal in No. 27. The terminal itself caters to both races, but separate facilities are maintained for the service of food.\n\n\n4\n In No. 26, one of the petitioners had purchased an umbrella in the drugstore just prior to taking his seat at the lunch counter, and had encountered no difficulty in making the purchase.\n\n\n5\n Although the problem was exactly the same in all three cases, the trial judge appeared to use different formulae for concluding petitioners' guilt in each opinion. In No. 26, the acts of the petitioners were said to be 'an act done in a manner calculated to, and actually did, unreasonably disturb and alarm the public.' In No. 27, the very same conduct was said to be 'an act on their part as would unreasonably disturb and alarm the public.' In No. 28, it was declared that the conduct 'foreseeably could alarm and disturb the public.' (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n6\n The opinions of the Supreme Court of Louisiana are not officially reported.\nUnder Art. 7, Sec. 10, of the Louisiana Constitution, the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over criminal cases extends only to questions of law, and then only where, inter alia, a fine exceeding three hundred dollars or imprisonment exceeding six months has been imposed. See State v. Di Vincenti, 232 La. 13, 93 So.2d 676; State v. Gaspard, 222 La. 222, 62 So.2d 281; State v. Price, 164 La. 376, 113 So. 882. The Louisiana Supreme Court has held that a question of law is presented, and that a case is thus reviewable, where the contention is that there is no evidence to support an element of the crime charged. State v. Daniels, 236 La. 998, 109 So.2d 896; State v. Brown, 224 La. 480, 70 So.2d 96; State v. Sbisa, 232 La. 961, 95 So.2d 619, and cases cited at n. 6, 232 La., at 969\u2014970, 95 So.2d, at 622. See Comment, 19 La.L.Rev. 843 (1959). Despite the court's purported review of the questions of law in these cases, the degree of punishment inflicted would deprive the court of appellate jurisdiction under Art. 7, Sec. 10. However, the Supreme Court also has a general supervisory jurisdiction, exercised only in the sound discretion of the court (see State v. Morgan, 204 La. 499, 502, 15 So.2d 866, 867), over all inferior courts under Art. 7, Sec. 10; it appears that this is the provision which the petitioners attempted to invoke with their extraordinary writs in these cases. See also Art. 7, Sec. 2, of the Louisiana Constitution.\n\n\n7\n In addition to the petitioners' contentions the United States argues that in No. 27 the petitioners' arrests and convictions deprived them of their rights under the Interstate Commerce Act to service on a nondiscriminatory basis in a restaurant of a bus terminal operated as part of interstate commerce. Cf. Boynton v. Com. of Virginia, 364 U.S. 454, 81 S.Ct. 182, 5 L.Ed.2d 206.\n\n\n8\n The Government, as well as petitioners, point out that in addition to state statutes requiring segregation in specific situations in Louisiana, the Louisiana Legislature in 1960 adopted the following preface to a joint resolution concerning the possible integration of any tax-supported facility in the State:\n'WHEREAS, Louisiana has always maintained a policy of segregation of the races, and\n'WHEREAS, it is the intention of the citizens of this sovereign state that such a policy be continued. * * *' Act No. 630 of 1960, to amend Article X of the Louisiana Constitution.\n\n\n9\n See Thompson v. City of Louisville, 362 U.S. 199, 80 S.Ct. 624.\n\n\n10\n Cf. Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U.S. 196, 201, 68 S.Ct. 514, 517, 92 L.Ed. 644. See Thompson v. City of Louisville, 362 U.S. 199, 206, 80 S.Ct. 624, 629, and the cases cited at footnote 13.\n\n\n11\n Counsel for the respondent admitted on oral argument that the Louisiana trespass statute in force at the time of the petitioners' arrests would probably not have applied to these facts. Apparently, the Louisiana Legislature agreed, for, in 1960, subsequent to petitioners' acts, the legislature passed a new criminal trespass statute (LSA\u2014R.S. 14:63.3 (1960 Supp.)), which reads:\n'No person shall without authority of laws go into or upon * * * any structure * * * which belongs to another * * * after having been forbidden to do so * * * by any owner, lessee, or custodian of the property or by any other authorized person. * * *'\nWe express no opinion whether, on the facts of these cases, the petitioners' conduct would have been unlawful under this statute.\n\n\n12\n The Supreme Court of Louisiana has also held that an accused may not be convicted on pleadings which fail to state the specific crime with which he is charged. State v. Morgan, 204 La. 499, 15 So.2d 866 (1943).\n\n\n13\n We express no view as to the constitutionality of the petitioners' convictions as attacked by their argument that the statute (\u00a7 103(7)) is so vague and uncertain, with its resulting lack of notice of what conduct the legislature intended to make criminal, as to violate due process. Cf. Lanzetta v. State of New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 59 S.Ct. 618, 83 L.Ed. 888; Musser v. State of Utah, 333 U.S. 95, 68 S.Ct. 397, 92 L.Ed. 562; Winters v. People of State of New York, 333 U.S. 507, 68 S.Ct. 665, 92 L.Ed. 840.\n\n\n14\n The predecessor of Title 14, Section 103, was Act No. 227 of 1934, which provided, inter alia, 'That any person who shall go into any public place, (or) into or near any private house * * * and who shall (shout, swear, expose himself, discharge a firearm) * * * or who shall do any other act, in a manner calculated to disturb or alarm the inhabitants thereof, or persons present * * *' should be adjudged guilty of breaching the peace. In State v. Sanford, 203 La. 961, 14 So.2d 778, discussed immediately following in the text, the defendants were charged, as were the petitioners in the cases at bar, under the general, catch-all provision.\n\n\n15\n See Town of Ponchatoula v. Bates, 173 La. 824, 138 So. 851 (dictum).\n\n\n16\n See 2 Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction, \u00a7\u00a7 4909\u20144910 (Horack ed. 1943).\n\n\n17\n Such an interpretation has not been made where there was evidence of a contrary legislative intent or judicial reading. United States v. Alpers, 338 U.S. 680, 682\u2014683, 70 S.Ct. 352, 354, 94 L.Ed. 457; Gooch v. United States, 297 U.S. 124, 128, 56 S.Ct. 395, 397, 80 L.Ed. 522; Helvering v. Stockholms Enskilda Bank, 293 U.S. 84, 88\u201489, 55 S.Ct. 50, 52, 79 L.Ed. 211.\n\n\n18\n See also Town of Ponchatoula v. Bates, supra, note 15.\n\n\n19\n LSA\u2014R.S. 14:103.1 (1960 Supp.), now reads, in pertinent part, as follows:\n'A. Whoever with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, or under circumstances such that a breach of the peace may be occasioned thereby:\n'(4) refuses to leave the premises of another when requested so to do by any owner, lessee, or any employee thereof, shall be guilty of disturbing the peace.'\n\n\n20\n In all three cases the prosecution called as witnesses only the arresting officer and an employee from the restaurant in question. In none of the cases did the petitioners themselves testify or introduce any witnesses in their defense.\n\n\n21\n There is some inconsistency in the record, not material to our disposition of the case (see No. 28), as to who called the police; a police officer made a statement based on hearsay that the desk sergeant was called by 'some woman.'\n\n\n22\n As noted previously, this is the only case in which a representative of the restaurant called the police. In addition, this is the only case in which there is anything in the record concerning the possibility of a disturbance, and even here it is limited to the manager's single statement noted above.\n\n\n23\n Of course, even such a warning was not sufficient evidence to support a finding of breach of the peace in State v. Sanford.\n\n\n24\n Compare the basis for the state action in Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U.S. 60, 38 S.Ct. 16, 62 L.Ed. 149, and Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 3 L.Ed.2d 5.\n\n\n25\n The evidence in the records in Nos. 26 and 27 is similar. Each witness called by the State testified that the petitioners were arrested solely because they were Negroes sitting at a white lunch counter.\n\n\n26\n LSA\u2014R.S. 15:422 provides that Louisiana courts may take judicial notice of 'social and racial conditions prevailing in (the) state.' See State v. Bessa et al., 115 La. 259, 38 So. 985.\n\n\n27\n Compare the evidence contained in the records in Terminiello v. City of Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 69 S.Ct. 894, 93 L.Ed. 1131; and in Feiner v. People of State of New York, 340 U.S. 315, 71 S.Ct. 303, 95 L.Ed. 267.\n\n\n*\n If it were clear from these records that the proprietors involved had changed their policies and consented to the petitioners' remaining, we would, of course, have an entirely different case.\n\n\n1\n Article 135 of Louisiana's 1868 Constitution forbade segregation of the races in public schools. But that prohibition was dropped from Louisiana's 1879 Constitution. The latter by Article 231 authorized the establishment of a university for Negroes.\nWoodward, Strange Career of Jim Crow (1955), pp. 7\u20148:\n'* * * In bulk and detail as well as in effectiveness of enforcement the segregation codes were comparable with the black codes of the old regime, though the laxity that mitigated the harshness of the black codes was replaced by a rigidity that was more typical of the segregation code. That code lent the sanction of law to a racial ostracism that extended to churches and schools, to housing and jobs, to eating and drinking. Whether by law or by custom, that ostracism eventually extended to virtually all forms of public transportation, to sports and recreations, to hospitals, orphanages, prisons, and asylums, and ultimately to funeral homes, morgues, and cemeteries.'\n\n\n2\n We have held on numerous occasions that the States may not use their powers to enforce racial segregation in public facilities. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City v. Dawson, 350 U.S. 877, 76 S.Ct. 133, 100 L.Ed. 774 (1955) (public beaches and bathhouses); Holmes v. City of Atlanta, 350 U.S. 879, 76 S.Ct. 141, 100 L.Ed. 776 (1955) (municipal golf courses); Gayle v. Browder, 352 U.S. 903, 77 S.Ct. 145, 1 L.Ed.2d 114 (1956) (buses operated on city streets); New Orleans City Park Improvement Association v. Detiege, 358 U.S. 54, 79 S.Ct. 99, 3 L.Ed.2d 46 (1958) (golf course and city parks). For decisions of the lower federal courts holding racial segregation unconstitutional as applied to facilities open to public enjoyment and patronage, see Department of Conservation & Development, Division of Parks, of Virginia, v. Tate, 4 Cir., 231 F.2d 615 (state park); City of St. Petersburg v. Alsup, 5 Cir., 238 F.2d 830 (municipal beach and swimming pool); Morrison v. Davis, 5 Cir., 252 F.2d 102 (public transportation facilities).\n\n\n1\n The Louisiana statute, LSA\u2014R.S. 14:103, then provided:\n'Disturbing the peace is the doing of any of the following in such a manner as would foreseeably disturb or alarm the public:\n'(1) Engaging in a fistic encounter; or\n'(2) Using of any unnecessarily loud, offensive, or insulting language; or\n'(3) Appearing in an intoxicated condition; or\n'(4) Engaging in any act in a violent and tumultuous manner by any three or more persons; or\n'(5) Holding of an unlawful assembly; or\n'(6) Interruption of any lawful assembly of people; or\n'(7) Commission of any other act in such a manner as to unreasonably disturb or alarm the public.\n'Whoever commits the crime of disturbing the peace shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars, or imprisoned for not more than ninety days, or both.'\n\n\n2\n As Mr. Justice Jackson put it in Gryger v. Burke, 334 U.S. 728, 731, 68 S.Ct. 1256, 1258, 92 L.Ed. 1683:\n'We are not at liberty to conjecture that the trial court acted under an interpretation of the state law different from that which we might adopt and then set up our own interpretation as a basis for declaring that due process has been denied. We cannot treat a mere error of state law, if one occurred, as a denial of due process; otherwise, every erroneous decision by a state court on state law would come here as a federal constitutional question.'\n\n\n3\n There Mr. Justice Holmes said of a claim that a state court was constitutionally obliged to follow its own precedents: 'Even if it be true, as the plaintiff in error says, that the supreme court of Colorado departed from earlier and well-established precedents to meet the exigencies of this case, whatever might be thought of the justice or wisdom of such a step, the Constitution of the United States is not infringed. It is unnecessary to lay down an absolute rule beyond the possibility of exception. Exceptions have been held to exist. But, in general the decision of a court upon a question of law, however wrong and however contrary to previous decisions, is not an infraction of the 14th Amendment merely because it is wrong or because earlier decisions are reversed.'\n\n\n4\n In Briscoe, the waitress who had spoken to the defendants testified at the trial that she told them 'they would have to go to the other side to be served.' It was only when she responded affirmatively to a leading question, 'And you told them you couldn't serve them and asked them to move, is that correct?' that she provided any evidence at all to support a finding that the defendants were even asked by the management to move from the 'white' lunch counter. Contrary to what the trial court in Briscoe may have meant when it said that the defendants 'were requested to leave and they refused to leave' before the police appeared, the waitress' laconic reply furnished no evidence whatever that the defendants were requested to leave the establishments.\n\n\n5\n The owner of the drugstore in Garner testified that his store provided eating 'facilities for only one race, the white race,' and that when petitioners sat down at the lunch counter he 'advise(d) them that we couldn't serve them.' He admitted that 'negroes are very good customers' in the drugstore section of the establishment. In Hoston, the manager of the department store repeatedly insisted at the trial that the petitioners had not been 'requested to move over to the counter reserved for colored people.' When asked, 'They weren't asked to go over there?' he replied, 'They were advised that we would serve them over there.' He denied that the petitioners had been 'refused' service: 'We did not refuse to serve them. I merely did not serve them and told them that they would be served on the other side of the store. * * * As I stated before, we did not refuse to serve them. We merely advised them they would be served on the other side of the store.'\nIn contrast to what appears in Garner and Hoston, the circumstances in Briscoe see to me quite different. There is little reason to believe that the management of a restaurant in a Greyhound Bus Terminal would be nearly as concerned with offending Negro patrons because of their refusal to sit at the Negro counter as would the management of a merchandising establishment dependent on other trade than that available at its eating facilities. It may well have been assumed that pique at being asked to leave a 'white' lunch counter would readily yield to the need of having to use the buses to get to one's destination. Further, for all that appears, the restaurant and bus companies, in this instance, may have been entirely separate enterprises, or these 'sitters' may only have been 'eaters' and not 'travelers' as well.\n\n\n6\n In Garner there was evidence that 'a number of customers (were) seated at the counter.' In Hoston there was no evidence even of that kind.\n\n\n7\n The manager of the department store in Hoston seemed particularly complacent. Although two Negro girls sat 'adjoining' him while he was eating lunch at the counter, he finished his meal before calling the police. He instructed a waitress 'to offer service at the counter across the aisle,' but never approached the petitioners himself. He testified that his purpose in calling the police was that he 'feared that some disturbance might occur.'\n\n\n8\n The Connecticut statute, Cong.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 6194 (1930), provided:\n'Any person who shall disturb or break the peace by tumultuous and offensive carriage, noise or behavior, or by threatening, traducing, quarreling with, challenging, assaulting or striking another or shall disturb or break the peace, or provoke contention, by following or mocking any person, with abusive or indecent language, gestures or noise, or shall, by any writing, with intent to intimidate any person, threaten to commit any crime against him or his property or shall write or print and publicly exhibit or distribute, or shall publicly exhibit, post up or advertise, any offensive, indecent or abusive matter concerning any person, shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned in jail not more than one year or both.' (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n9\n Compare, for example, the statutes upheld in Beauharnais v. People of State of Illinois, 343 U.S. 250, 72 S.Ct. 725, 96 L.Ed. 919; Breard v. City of Alexandria, 341 U.S. 622, 71 S.Ct. 920, 95 L.Ed. 1233; Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77, 69 S.Ct. 448, 93 L.Ed. 513; Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U.S. 52; Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031; Cox v. State of New Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569, 61 S.Ct. 762, 85 L.Ed. 1049.\n\n\n10\n Mr. Justice Roberts, speaking for a unanimous Court in Cantwell, stated (310 U.S., at 307\u2014308, 60 S.Ct., at 904, 905):\n'Conviction on the fifth count (disorderly conduct) was not pursuant to a statute evincing a legislative judgment that street discussion of religious affairs, because of its tendency to provoke disorder, should be regulated, or a judgment that the playing of a phonograph on the streets should in the interest of comfort or privacy be limited or prevented. Violation of an Act exhibiting such a legislative judgment and narrowly drawn to prevent the supposed evil, would pose a question differing from that we must here answer. Such a declaration of the State's policy would weigh heavily in any challenge of the law as infringing constitutional limitations. Here, however, the judgment is based on a common law concept of the most general and undefined nature. The court below has held that the petitioner's conduct constituted the commission of an offense under the State law, and we accept its decision as binding upon us to that extent.\n'The offense known as breach of the peace embraces a great variety of conduct destroying or menacing public order and tranquility. It includes not only violent acts but acts and words likely to produce violence in others. No one would have the hardihood to suggest that the principle of freedom of speech sanctions incitement to riot or that religious liberty connotes the privilege to exhort others to physical attack upon those belonging to another sect. When clear and present danger of riot, disorder, interference with traffic upon the public streets, or other immediate threat to public safety, peace, or order, appears, the power of the State to prevent or punish is obvious. Equally obvious is it that a State may not unduly suppress free communication of views, religious or other, under the guise of conserving desirable conditions. Here we have a situation analogous to a conviction under a statute sweeping in a great variety of conduct under a general and indefinite characterization, and leaving to the executive and judicial branches too wide a discretion in its application.'\n\n\n11\n It follows, of course, that petitioners' refusal to accede to the request to leave made by police officers could also not constitutionally be punished under this general statute. Were it otherwise, the determination whether certain conduct constitutes a clear and present danger would be delegated to a police officer. Simply by ordering a defendant to cease his 'protected' activity, the officer could turn a continuation of that activity into a breach of the peace.\n\n\n12\n After the incidents which gave rise to these cases, the Louisiana Legislature passed a bill adding to the disturbance of the peace statute a second clause, LSA\u2014R.S. \u00a7 14:103, subd. B, which provides:\n'B. Any person or persons * * * while in or on the premises of another * * * on which property any store, restaurant, drug store * * * or any other lawful business is operated which engages in selling articles of merchandise or services or accommodation to members of the public, or engages generally in business transactions with members of the public, who shall:\n'(1) prevent or seek to prevent, or interfere or seek to interfere with the owner or operator of such place of business, or his agents or employees, serving or selling food and drink * * * or\n'(2) prevent or seek to prevent, or interfere or seek to interfere with other persons who are expressly or impliedly invited upon said premises, or with prospective customers coming into or frequenting such premises in the normal course of the operation of the business conducted and carried on upon said premises, shall be guilty of disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace * * *.' 1 La.Acts, 1960, pp. 235\u2014236.\n\n\n13\n Because of the absence of any evidence in the Briscoe record regarding the legal relationship between the restaurant and the Greyhound Bus Terminal in Baton Rouge, on whose premises it was located, I would not pass in this case on the Solicitor General's suggestion, made as amicus curiae, that segregated facilities were prohibited by \u00a7 216(d) of Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 316(d), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 316(d). See Boynton v. Com. of Virginia, 364 U.S. 454, 81 S.Ct. 182, 5 L.Ed.2d 206.\n\n\n14\n I do not intend to suggest that the present Louisiana statute, either on its face or as it might be applied with respect to conduct not within the 'liberty' assured by the Fourteenth Amendment, is or would be unconstitutional for vagueness. Cf. Winters v. People of State of New York, supra, 333 U.S., at 524 526, 68 S.Ct., at 676 (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n15\n The criminal trespass statute in force in Louisiana at the time of petitioners' acts prohibited only 'unauthorized and intentional taking (of) possession' and 'unauthorized and intentional entry' on another's property. LSA\u2014R.S. \u00a7 14:63 (1950). No attempt was made to prosecute the petitioners under this law. The statute has since been amended to cover 'remaining in places after being forbidden,' 1 La.Acts, 1960, pp. 245\u2014248, and an anti-trespass provision is now included in the disturbance of the peace statute, 1 La.Acts, 1960, p. 234.\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"373 U.S. 668\n83 S.Ct. 1433\n10 L.Ed.2d 622\nLouis McNEESE, Jr., a Minor, by Mabel McNeese, His  Mother and Next Friend, et al., Petitioners,v.BOARD OF EDUCATION FOR COMMUNITY UNIT SCHOOL DISTRICT  187, CAHOKIA, ILLINOIS, et al.\nNo. 480.\nArgued April 23, 1963.\nDecided June 3, 1963.\n\nRaymond E. Harth, Chicago, Ill., for petitioners.\nHoward Boman, East St. Louis, Ill., and Robert H. Reiter, Washington, D.C., for respondents.\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis suit, which invokes the jurisdiction of the District Court under the Civil Rights Act, is brought to vindicate the rights of plaintiffs who are Negro students in the Illinois public school system. The complaint alleges that Chenot School, St. Clair County, was built and its attendance area boundaries drawn in 1957 so as to make it exclusively a Negro school. It alleges that due to overcrowded conditions in an adjacent school, Centreville, which is in the same school district, all fifth and sixth grade classes in that school (containing 97% white students) were transferred to Chenot and kept segregated there. It alleges that enrollment at Chenot consists of 251 Negroes and 254 whites, all of the whites being in the group transferred from Centreville. It alleges that Negro students, with the exception of the eight transferred from Centreville, attend classes in one part of the school, separate and apart from the whites, and are compelled to use entrances and exits separate from the whites'. It alleges that Chenot school is a segregated school in conflict with the Constitution of the United States; and it prays for equitable relief, including registration of plaintiffs in racially integrated schools pursuant to a plan approved by the District Court.\n\n\n2\nRespondents moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground, inter alia, that the plaintiffs had not exhausted the administrative remedies provided by Illinois law. The District Court granted the motion. D.C., 199 F.Supp. 403. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 7 Cir., 305 F.2d 783. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted. 371 U.S. 933, 83 S.Ct. 307, 9 L.Ed.2d 269.\n\n\n3\nThe administrative remedy, which the lower courts held plaintiffs must first exhaust, is contained in the Illinois School Code. IllRev.Stat.1961, c. 122, \u00a7 22\u201419. By that Code, 50 residents of a school district or 10%, whichever is lesser, can file a complaint with the Superintendent of Public Instruction alleging that a pupil has been segregated in a school on account of race. The Superintendent, on notice to the school board, puts the complaint down for hearing within a prescribed time. After hearing, the Superintendent notifies the parties of his decision and, if he decides that the allegations in the complaint are 'substantially correct,' requests the Attorney General to bring suit to rectify the practice. Any final decision of the Superintendent may be reviewed by the courts. Moreover, under the School Code a school district may not file a claim for state aid unless it files with the Superintendent a sworn statement that the school district has complied with the constitutional and statutory provisions outlawing segregation in the public schools. See Ill.Const., Art. VIII, \u00a7 1; School Code \u00a7\u00a7 10\u201422:5, 22\u201411, 22\u201412.\n\n\n4\nRespondents, while saying that Illinois law does not require the Superintendent to refuse to certify claims for state aid if he finds the particular school board practices segregation, contends that the Superintendent would have the power to withhold his certificate and as a practical matter would do so.\n\n\n5\nWe have previously indicated that relief under the Civil Rights Act may not be defeated because relief was not first sought under state law which provided a remedy. We stated in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 183, 81 S.Ct. 473, 482, 5 L.Ed.2d 492: SU 'It is no answer that the State has a law which if enforced would give relief. The federal remedy is supplementary to the state remedy, and the latter need not be first sought and refused before the federal one is invoked.'\n\n\n6\nThe cause of action alleged here1 is pleaded in terms of R.S. \u00a7 1979, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, which reads:\n\n\n7\n'Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance,      regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory,      subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the      United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof      to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities      secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the      party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other      proper proceeding for redress.'\n\n\n8\nThat is the statute that was involved in Monroe v. Pape, supra; and we reviewed its history at length in that case. 365 U.S., at 171 et seq., 81 S.Ct., at 475 et seq. The purposes were severalfold\u2014to override certain kinds of state laws, to provide a remedy where state law was inadequate, 'to provide a federal remedy where the state remedy, though adequate in theory, was not available in practice' (id., 174, 81 S.Ct. 477), and to provide a remedy in the federal courts supplementary to any remedy any State might have. Id., 180\u2014183, 81 S.Ct. 480\u2014482.\n\n\n9\nWe would defeat those purposes if we held that assertion of a federal claim in a federal court must await an attempt to vindicate the same claim in a state court. The First Congress created federal courts as the chief\u2014though not always the exclusive\u2014tribunals for enforcement of federal rights. The heads of jurisdiction of the District Court, at the start limited,2 are now numerous. In the beginning the main concern was the security of commercial intercourse, which 'parochial prejudice' might endanger.3\n\n\n10\n'Maritime commerce was then the jugular vein of the Thirteen      States. The need for a body of law applicable throughout the      nation was recognized by every shade of opinion in the      Constitutional Convention. From this recognition it was an      easy step to entrust the development of such law to a      distinctive system of courts, administering the same      doctrines, following the same procedure, and subject to the      same nationalist influences.'4\n\n\n11\nAs the beneficiaries of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments became articulate and the nationalist needs multiplied, the heads of jurisdiction of the District Courts increased, and that increase was a measure of the broadening federal domain in the area of individual rights.\n\n\n12\nWhere strands of local law are woven into the case that is before the federal court, we have directed a District Court to refrain temporarily from exercising its jurisdiction until a suit could be brought in the state court. See Railroad Comm'n of Texas v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971; Thompson v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 309 U.S. 478, 60 S.Ct. 628, 84 L.Ed. 876; Harrison v. N.A.A.C.P., 360 U.S. 167, 79 S.Ct. 1025, 3 L.Ed.2d 1152. Thus we have stayed the hands of a Federal District Court when it sought to enjoin enforcement of a state administrative order enforcing state law, since any federal question could be reviewed when the cases came here through the hierarchy of state courts. Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315, 63 S.Ct. 1098, 87 L.Ed. 1424. The variations on the theme have been numerous.5\n\n\n13\nWe have, however, in the present case no underlying issue of state law controlling this litigation. The right alleged is as plainly federal in origin and nature as those vindicated in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873. Nor is the federal right in any way entangled in a skein of state law that must be untangled before the federal case can proceed. For petitioners assert that respondents have been and are depriving them of rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. It is immaterial whether respondents' conduct is legal or illegal as a matter of state law. Monroe v. Pape, supra, 365 U.S., at 171 187, 81 S.Ct., at 475\u2014484. Such claims are entitled to be adjudicated in the federal courts.6 Monroe v. Pape, supra, 365 U.S. at 183, 81 S.Ct. at 481; Gayle v. Browder, 352 U.S. 903, 77 S.Ct. 145, 1 L.Ed.2d 114, affirming 142 F.Supp. 707; Borders v. Rippy, 5 Cir., 247 F.2d 268, 271. Cf., e.g., Lane v. Wilson, 307 U.S. 268, 59 S.Ct. 872, 83 L.Ed. 1281; Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649, 64 S.Ct. 757, 88 L.Ed. 987; Schnell v. Davis, 336 U.S. 933, 69 S.Ct. 749, 93 L.Ed. 1093, affirming 81 F.Supp. 872; Turner v. Memphis, 369 U.S. 350, 82 S.Ct. 805, 7 L.Ed.2d 762.\n\n\n14\nMoreover, it is by no means clear that Illinois law provides petitioners with an administrative remedy sufficiently adequate to preclude prior resort to a federal court for protection of their federal rights. Under \u00a7 22\u201419 of the Illinois School Code petitioners could file a complaint alleging discrimination if they could obtain the subscription of the lesser of 50 residents or 10% of the school district. The Superintendent would then be required to hold a hearing on the matter. And,\n\n\n15\n'If he so determines (that the allegations of the complaint      are substantially correct), he shall request the Attorney      General to apply to the appropriate circuit court for such      injunctive or other relief as may be necessary to rectify the      practice complained of.' (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n16\nThe Superintendent himself apparently has no power to order corrective action. In other words, his 'only function * * * is to investigate, recommend and report. (He) can give no remedy. (He) can made no controlling finding of law or fact. (His) recommendation need not be followed by any court * * * or executive officer.' United States Alkali Export Ass'n v. United States, 325 U.S. 196, 210, 65 S.Ct. 1120, 1128, 89 L.Ed. 1554. It would be anomalous to conclude that such a remedy forecloses suit in the federal courts when the most it could produce is a state court action that would have no such effect. See Lane v. Wilson, supra, at 274\u2014275, 59 S.Ct. at 875\u2014876; Monroe v. Pape, supra.\n\n\n17\nRespondents urge, however, that prior resort to the Superintendent is necessary because by \u00a7 2\u20143.25 he can revoke recognition of a school district guilty of violating pupils' Fourteenth Amendment rights, and recognition is a necessary condition to state financial aid. Furthermore, state aid cannot be received by a district unless it submits a sworn statement that it does not discriminate between students 'on account of color, creed, race or nationality.' \u00a7\u00a7 10\u201422.5, 18\u201412. Respondents say that the Superintendent would not certify a district for state aid if he determined that its sworn statement was false Apparently no Illinois cases have held that the Superintendent has authority to withhold funds once he has received an affidavit from the district, even if he determines that the affidavit is false. In any event, the withholding of state aid is at best only an indirect sanction of Fourteenth Amendment rights. When federal rights are subject to such tenuous protection, prior resort to a state proceeding is not necessary. See Hillsborough v. Cromwell, 326 U.S. 620, 625\u2014626, 66 S.Ct. 445, 90 L.Ed. 358.\n\n\n18\nReversed.\n\n\n19\nMr. Justice HARLAN, dissenting.\n\n\n20\nIn Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315, 317\u2014318, 63 S.Ct. 1098, 1099, this Court said:\n\n\n21\n'Although a federal equity court does have jurisdiction of a      particular proceeding, it may, in its sound discretion,      whether its jurisdiction is invoked on the ground of      diversity of citizenship or otherwise, 'refuse to enforce or      protect legal rights, the exercise of which may be      prejudicial to the public interest'; (citing United States v.      Dern, 289 U.S. 352, 360, 53 S.Ct. 614, 617, 77 L.Ed. 1250)      for it 'is in the public interest that federal courts of      equity should exercise their discretionary power with proper      regard for the rightful independence of state governments in      carrying out their domestic policy.' * * * (Citing      Pennsylvania v. Williams, 294 U.S. 176, 185, 55 S.Ct. 380, 79      L.Ed. 841.) Assuming that the federal district court had      jurisdiction, should it, as a matter of sound equitable      discretion, have declined to exercise that jurisdiction      here?'\n\n\n22\nThis wise approach has been followed by the lower federal courts in 'school segregation' cases (see, e.g., Carson v. Board of Education of McDowell County, 4 Cir., 227 F.2d 789; Carson v. Warlick, 4 Cir., 238 F.2d 724; Covington v. Edwards, 4 Cir., 264 F.2d 780; Holt v. Raleigh City Board of Education, 4 Cir., 265 F.2d 95; Parham v. Dove, 8 Cir., 271 F.2d 132; Shepard v. Board of Education of the City of Englewood, D.C., 207 F.Supp. 341), and more than once this Court has refused to interfere (see Carson v. Warlick, supra, cert. denied, 353 U.S. 910, 77 S.Ct. 665, 1 L.Ed.2d 664; Holt v. Raleigh City Board of Education, supra, cert. denied, 361 U.S. 818, 80 S.Ct. 59, 4 L.Ed.2d 63).1 For several reasons I think the present case is peculiarly one where, as was said in Burford (at p. 334, 63 S.Ct. at p. 1107), 'a sound respect for the independence of state action requires the federal equity court to stay its hand.'\n\n\n23\n1. It is apparent on the face of the complaint that this case is quite atypical of others that have come before this Court, in that the Chenot School's student body includes both white and Negro students\u2014in almost equal numbers\u2014and in that none of the petitioners (or others whom they purport to represent) has been refused enrollment in the school. The alleged discriminatory practices relate, rather, to the manner in which this particular school district was formed and to the way in which the internal affairs of the school are administered. These are matters in which the federal courts should not initially become embroiled. Their exploration and correction, if need be, are much better left to local authority in the first instance.\n\n\n24\n2. There is nothing that leaves room for serious doubt as to the efficacy of the administrative remedy which Illinois has provided. (The text of the statute is set forth in the Appendix to this opinion.) The fact that the Superintendent of Public Instruction himself possesses no corrective power and that he can only 'request' the Attorney General to enforce his findings by appropriate court proceedings does not, in my opinion, leave the administrative proceeding sanctionless (compare United States Alkali Export Assn. v. United States, 325 U.S. 196, 65 S.Ct. 1120, 89 L.Ed. 1554), or, as in Lane v. Wilson, 307 U.S. 268, 59 S.Ct. 872, 83 L.Ed. 1281, serve to remove this case from the 'exhaustion' requirements of Burford. If the Superintendent refuses to activate the Attorney General, his decision (as with a contrary one) is subject to judicial review. It is not suggested that the Attorney General could not also be compelled to act if he improperly refused to do so. And it must of course be assumed that these two responsible public officials will fully perform their sworn duty. Moreover, the terms of the statute itself which, among other things, provides for the use of compulsory process, strongly attest to the fact that the administrative remedy was intended as serious business and not as an exercise that might abort before fulfillment.\n\n\n25\nNor can this administrative remedy otherwise be regarded as deficient. The fact that it takes a minimal number of school district residents to initiate a complaint before the Superintendent can hardly be deemed an untoward or unduly burdensome requirement. And the proceeding surely finds a strong practical even though 'indirect sanction' (ante, p. 676) in the power of the Superintendent at least to make it more difficult for a school, guilty of racial discrimination, to obtain state financial aid\u2014either by revoking 'recognition' of the school district (ante, p. 675) or, as suggested to us by respondents' attorneys, by refusing to certify such a school for state aid.2\n\n\n26\n3. Finally, we should be slow to hold unavailing an administrative remedy afforded by a State which long before Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873, had outlawed both by its constitution and statutes racial discrimination in its public schools,3 and which since Brown has passed the further implementing legislation drawn in question in this litigation (Appendix). For myself I am unwilling to assume that these solemn constitutional and legislative pronouncements of Illinois mean anything less than what they say or that the rights assured by them and by the Fourteenth Amendment will not be fully and promptly vindicated by the State if petitioners can make good their grievances.\n\n\n27\nI would affirm.\n\n\n28\nAPPENDIX TO OPINION OF MR. JUSTICE HARLAN.\n\n\n29\nSection 22\u201419 of the School Code of Illinois provides:\n\n\n30\n'Upon the filing of a complaint with the Superintendent of      Public Instruction, executed in duplicate and subscribed with      the names and addresses of at least 50 residents of a school      district or 10%, whichever is lesser, alleging that any pupil      has been excluded from or segregated in any school on account      of his color, race, nationality, religion or religious      affiliation, or that any employee of or applicant for      employment or assignment with any such school district has      been questioned concerning his color, race, nationality,      religion or religious affiliation or subjected to      discrimination by reason thereof, by or on behalf of the      school board of such district, the Superintendent of Public      Instruction shall promptly mail a copy of such complaint to      the secretary or clerk of such school board.\n\n\n31\n'The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall fix a date,      not less than 20 nor more than 30 days from the date of the      filing of such complaint, for a hearing upon the allegations      therein. He may also fix a date for a hearing whenever he has      reason to believe that such discrimination may exist in any      school district. Reasonable notice of the time and place of      such hearing shall be mailed to the secretary or clerk of the      school board and to the first subscriber to such complaint.\n\n\n32\n'The Superintendent of Public Instruction may designate           an assistant to conduct such hearing and receive           testimony concerning the situation complained of. The           complainants may be represented at such hearing by one           of their number or by counsel. Each party shall have the           privilege of cross examining witnesses. The           Superintendent of Public Instruction or the hearing           officer appointed by him shall have the power to           subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, and require           the production of evidence relating to any relevant           matter under this Act. Any Circuit or Superior Court of           this State, or any judge thereof, either in term time or           vacation, upon the application of the Superintendent of           Public Instruction or the hearing officer appointed by           him, may, in its or his discretion, compel the           attendance of witnesses, the production of books,           papers, records or memoranda and the giving of testimony           befor the Superintendent of Public Instruction or the           hearing officer appointed by him conducting an           investigation or holding a hearing authorized by this           Act, by an attachment for contempt, or otherwise, in the           same manner as production of evidence may be compelled           before said court. The Superintendent of Public           Instruction or the hearing officer appointed by him may           cause the depositions of witnesses within the State to           be taken in the manner prescribed by law for like           depositions in civil actions in courts of this State,           and to that end compel the attendance of witnesses and           the production of books, papers, records or memoranda.           All testimony shall be taken under oath administered by           the hearing officer, but the formal rules pertaining to           evidence in judicial proceedings shall not apply. The           Superintendent of Public Instruction shall provide a           competent reporter to take notes of all testimony.           Either party desiring a transcript of the hearing shall           pay for the cost of such transcript. The hearing officer           shall report a summary of the testimony to the           Superintendent of Public Instruction who shall determine whether the      allegations of the complaint are substantially correct. The      Superintendent of Public Instruction shall notify both      parties of his decision. If he so determines, he shall      request the Attorney General to apply to the appropriate      circuit court for such injunctive or other relief as may be      necessary to rectify the practice complained of.\n\n\n33\n'The provisions of the 'Administrative Review Act', approved      May 8, 1945, and all amendments and modifications thereof and      the rules adopted pursuant thereto shall apply to and govern      all proceedings for the judicial review of any final decision      rendered by the Superintendent of Public Instruction pursuant      to this Section.'\n\n\n\n1\n Federal jurisdiction is asserted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, which in material part reads as follows:\n'The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action authorized by law to be commenced by any person:\n'(3) To redress the deprivation, under color of any State law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States or by any Act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States.'\n\n\n2\n General 'arising under' jurisdiction was not conferred on federal courts of first instance until passage of the Judiciary Act of 1875, 18 Stat. 470. See Hart and Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System, 727\u2014733.\n\n\n3\n Frankfurter and Landis, The Business of the Supreme Court (1928), pp. 8\u20149.\n\n\n4\n Id., p. 7.\n\n\n5\n See Note, 59 Col.L.Rev. 749. Yet where Congress creates a head of federal jurisdiction which entails a responsibility to adjudicate the claim on the basis of state law, viz., diversity of citizenship, as was true in Meredith v. Winter Haven, 320 U.S. 228, 64 S.Ct. 7, 88 L.Ed. 9, we hold that difficulties and perplexities of state law are no reason for referral of the problem to the state court:\n'We are pointed to no public policy or interest which would be served by withholding from petitioners the benefit of the jurisdiction which Congress has created with the purpose that it should be availed of and exercised subject only to such limitations as traditionally justify courts in declining to exercise the jurisdiction which they possess. To remit the parties to the state courts is to delay further the disposition of the litigation which has been pending for more than two years and which is now ready for decision. It is to penalize petitioners for resorting to a jurisdiction which they were entitled to invoke, in the absence of any special circumstances which would warrant a refusal to exercise it.' Id., p. 237, 64 S.Ct. p. 12.\nAnd we held in Kline v. Burke Construction Co., 260 U.S. 226, 43 S.Ct. 79, 67 L.Ed. 226, that, apart from contests over a res (Pennsylvania v. Williams, 294 U.S. 176, 55 S.Ct. 380, 79 L.Ed. 841), a suit in personam based on diversity of citizenship could continue in the federal court even though a suit on the same cause of action had been started in the state court:\n'Each court is free to proceed in its own way and in its own time, without reference to the proceedings in the other court. Whenever a judgment is rendered in one of the courts and pleaded in the other, the effect of that judgment is to be determined by the application of the principles of res adjudicata by the court in which the action is still pending in the orderly exercise of its jurisdiction, as it would determine any other question of fact or law arising in the progress of the case. The rule, therefore, has become generally established that where the action first brought is in personam and seeks only a personal judgment, another action for the same cause in another jurisdiction is not precluded.' 260 U.S., p. 230, 43 S.Ct. p. 81.\n\n\n6\n As well stated by Judge Murrah in Stapleton v. Mitchell, 60 F.Supp. 51, 55, appeal dismissed pursuant to stipulation, 326 U.S. 690, 66 S.Ct. 172, 90 L.Ed. 406: 'We yet like to believe that wherever the Federal courts sit, human rights under the Federal Constitution are always a proper subject for adjudication, and that we have not the right to decline the exercise of that jurisdiction simply because the rights asserted may be adjudicated in some other forum.'\n\n\n1\n Cases such as Mannings v. Board of Public Instruction of Hillsborough County, 5 Cir., 277 F.2d 370, and Borders v. Rippy, 5 Cir., 247 F.2d 268 (where the school boards had taken no affirmative steps whatever to desegregate the schools), and Orleans Parish School Board v. Bush, 5 Cir., 242 F.2d 156, and Gibson v. Board of Public Instrucdtion of Dade County, 5 Cir., 246 F.2d 913 (arising in States having school segregation statutes on their books), are wide of the mark in the circumstances of this case.\n\n\n2\n Section 18\u201412 of the School Code of Illinois provides in part:\n'No State aid claim may be filed for any district unless the clerk or secretary of the school board executes and files with the Superintendent of Public Instruction, on forms prescribed by him, a sworn statement that the district has complied with the requirements of Section 10\u201422.5 in regard to the non-segregation of pupils on account of color, creed, race or nationality.'\n\n\n3\n As early as 1901 the Supreme Court of Illinois in People ex rel. Bibb v. Mayor etc., of City of Alton, 193 Ill. 309, 312, 61 N.E. 1077, 1078, 56 L.R.A. 95, construing Art. VIII, \u00a7 1, of the Illinois Constitution, held:\n'The complaint of the relator is that his children have been excluded, on account of their color, from the public school of said city located near his residence, and been required to attend a school located a mile and a half distant from his residence, established exclusively for colored children. Such complaint is not met by showing that the schools established for colored children in said city equal or surpass in educational facilities the schools established in said city for white children. Under the law the common council of said city had no right to establish different schools for the white children and colored children of said city, and to exclude the colored children from the schools established for white children, even though the schools established for colored children furnished educational facilities equal or superior to those of the schools established for white children.'\nSection 10\u201422.5 of the School Code of Illinois has provided since 1945 that:\n'* * * no pupil shall be excluded from or segregated in any such school on account of his color, race or nationality.'\nSections 22\u201411 and 22\u201412 of the School Code, enacted in 1909, provide:\n'Any school officer or other person who excludes or aids in excluding from the public schools, on account of color, any child who is entitled to the benefits of such school shall be fined not less than $5 nor more than $100.'\n'Whoever by threat, menace or intimidation prevents any colored child entitled to attend a public school in this State from attending such school shall be fined not exceeding $25.'\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"369 U.S. 186\n82 S.Ct. 691\n7 L.Ed.2d 663\nCharles W. BAKER et al., Appellants,v.Joe C. CARR et al.\nNo. 6.\nReargued Oct. 9, 1961.\nDecided March 26, 1962.\n\nCharles S. Rhyne, Washington, D.C., and Z. T. Osborn, Jr., Nashville, Tenn., for appellants.\nJack Wilson, Chattanooga, Tenn., for appellees.\nSolicitor General Archibald Cox, Washington, D.C., for the United States, as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\nMr. Justice BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis civil action was brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1988 to redress the alleged deprivation of federal constitutional rights. The complaint, alleging that by means of a 1901 statute of Tennessee apportioning the members of the General Assembly among the State's 95 counties,1 'these plaintiffs and others similarly situated, are denied the equal protection of the laws accorded them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States by virtue of the debasement of their votes,' was dismissed by a three-judge court convened under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2281 in the Middle District of Tennessee.2 The court held that it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter and also that no claim was stated upon which relief could be granted. 179 F.Supp. 824. We noted probable jurisdiction of the appeal. 364 U.S. 898, 81 S.Ct. 230, 5 L.Ed.2d 193.3 We hold that the dismissal was error, and remand the cause to the District Court for trial and further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n2\nThe General Assembly of Tennessee consists of the Senate with 33 members and the House of Representatives with 99 members. The Tennessee Constitution provides in Art. II as follows:\n\n\n3\n'Sec. 3. Legislative authority\u2014Term of office.\u2014The      Legislative authority of this State shall be vested in a      General Assembly, which shall consist of a Senate and House      of Representatives, both dependent on the people; who shall      hold their offices for two years from the day of the general      election.\n\n\n4\n'Sec. 4. Census.\u2014An enumeration of the qualified voters, and      an apportionment of the Representatives in the General      Assembly, shall be made in the year one thousand eight      hundred and seventy-one, and within every subsequent term of      ten years.\n\n\n5\n'Sec. 5. Apportionment of representatives.\u2014The number of      Representatives shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the      several counties or districts, according to the number of      qualified voters in each; and shall not exceed seventy-five,      until the population of the State shall be one million and a      half, and shall never exceed ninety-nine; Provided, that any      county having two-thirds of the ratio shall be entitled to      one member.\n\n\n6\n'Sec 6. Apportionment of senators.\u2014The number of Senators      shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be      apportioned among the several counties or districts according      to the number of qualified electors in each, and shall not      exceed one-third the number of representatives. In      apportioning the Senators among the different counties, the      fraction that may be lost by any county or counties, in the      apportionment of members to the House of Representatives,      shall be made up to such county or counties in the Senate, as      near as may be practicable. When a district is composed of      two or more counties, they shall be adjoining; and no county      shall be divided in forming a district.'\n\n\n7\nThus, Tennessee's standard for allocating legislative representation among her counties is the total number of qualified voters resident in the respective counties, subject only to minor qualifications.4 Decennial reapportionment in compliance with the constitutional scheme was effected by the General Assembly each decade from 1871 to 1901. The 1871 apportionment5 was preceded by an 1870 statute requiring an enumeration.6 The 1881 apportionment involved three statutes, the first authorizing an enumeration, the second enlarging the Senate from 25 to 33 members and the House from 75 to 99 members, and the third apportioning the membership of both Houses.7 In 1891 there were both an enumeration and an apportionment.8 In 1901 the General Assembly abandoned separate enumeration in favor of reliance upon the Federal Census and passed the Apportionment Act here in controversy.9 In the more than 60 years since that action, all proposals in both Houses of the General Assembly for reapportionment have failed to pass.10\n\n\n8\nBetween 1901 and 1961, Tennessee has experienced substantial growth and redistribution of her population. In 1901 the population was 2,020,616, of whom 487,380 were eligible to vote.11 The 1960 Federal Census reports the State's population at 3,567,089, of whom 2,092,891 are eligible to vote.12 The relative standings of the counties in terms of qualified voters have changed significantly. It is primarily the continued application of the 1901 Apportionment Act to this shifted and enlarged voting population which gives rise to the present controversy.\n\n\n9\nIndeed, the complaint alleges that the 1901 statute, even as of the time of its passage, 'made no apportionment of Representatives and Senators in accordance with the constitutional formula * * *, but instead arbitrarily and capriciously apportioned representatives in the Senate and House without reference * * * to any logical or reasonable formula whatever.'13 It is further alleged that 'because of the population changes since 1900, and the failure of the Legislature to reapportion itself since 1901,' the 1901 statute became 'unconstitutional and obsolete.' Appellants also argue that, because of the composition of the legislature effected by the 1901 Apportionment Act, redress in the form of a state constitutional amendment to change the entire mechanism for reapportioning, or any other change short of that, is difficult or impossible.14 The complaint concludes that 'these plaintiffs and others similarly situated, are denied the equal protection of the laws accorded them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States by virtue of the debasement of their votes.'15 They seek a declaration that the 1901 statute is unconstitutional and an injunction restraining the appellees from acting to conduct any further elections under it. They also pray that unless and until the General Assembly enacts a valid reapportionment, the District Court should either decree a reapportionment by mathematical application of the Tennessee constitutional formulae to the most recent Federal Census figures, or direct the appellees to conduct legislative elections, primary and general, at large. They also pray for such other and further relief as may be appropriate.\n\nI.\n\n10\nTHE DISTRICT COURT'S OPINION AND ORDER OF DISMISSAL.\n\n\n11\nBecause we deal with this case on appeal from an order of dismissal granted on appellees' motions, precise identification of the issues presently confronting us demands clear exposition of the grounds upon which the District Court rested in dismissing the case. The dismissal order recited that the court sustained the appellees' grounds '(1) that the Court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, and (2) that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted * * *.'\n\n\n12\nIn the setting of a case such as this, the recited grounds embrace two possible reasons for dismissal:\n\n\n13\nFirst: That the facts and injury alleged, the legal bases invoked as creating the rights and duties relied upon, and the relief sought, fail to come within that language of Article III of the Constitution and of the jurisdictional statutes which define those matters concerning which United States District Courts are empowered to act;\n\n\n14\nSecond: That, although the matter is cognizable and facts are alleged which establish infringement of appellants' rights as a result of state legislative action departing from a federal constitutional standard, the court will not proceed because the matter is considered unsuited to judicial inquiry or adjustment.\n\n\n15\nWe treat the first ground of dismissal as 'lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter.' The second we consider to result in a failure to state a justiciable cause of action.\n\n\n16\nThe District Court's dismissal order recited that it was issued in conformity with the court's per curiam opinion. The opinion reveals that the court rested its dismissal upon lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and lack of a justiciable cause of action without attempting to distinguish between these grounds. After noting that the plaintiffs challenged the existing legislative apportionment in Tennessee under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, and summarizing the supporting allegations and the relief requested, the court stated that\n\n\n17\n'The action is presently before the Court upon the      defendants' motion to dismiss predicated upon three grounds: first, that the Court lacks jurisdiction of the      subject matter; second, that the complaints fail to state a      claim upon which relief can be granted; and third, that      indispensable party defendants are not before the Court.' 179      F.Supp., at 826.\n\n\n18\nThe court proceeded to explain its action as turning on the case's presenting a 'question of the distribution of political strength for legislative purposes.' For,\n\n\n19\n'From a review of (numerous Supreme Court) * * * decisions      there can be no doubt that the federal rule, as enunciated      and applied by the Supreme Court, is that the federal courts,      whether from a lack of jurisdiction or from the      inappropriateness of the subject matter for judicial      consideration, will not intervene in cases of this type to      compel legislative reapportionment.' 179 F.Supp., at 826.\n\n\n20\nThe court went on to express doubts as to the feasibility of the various possible remedies sought by the plaintiffs. 179 F.Supp., at 827\u2014828. Then it made clear that its dismissal reflected a view not of doubt that violation of constitutional rights was alleged, but of a court's impotence to correct that violation:\n\n\n21\n'With the plaintiffs' argument that the legislature of      Tennessee is guilty of a clear violation of the state      constitution and of the rights of the plaintiffs the Court      entirely agrees. It also agrees that the evil is a serious      one which should be corrected without further delay. But even      so the remedy in this situation clearly does not lie with the      courts. It has long been recognized and is accepted doctrine      that there are indeed some rights guaranteed by the      Constitution for the violation of which the courts cannot      give redress.' 179 F.Supp., at 828.\n\n\n22\nIn light of the District Court's treatment of the case, we hold today only (a) that the court possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter; (b) that a justiciable cause of action is stated upon which appellants would be entitled to appropriate relief; and (c) because appellees raise the issue before this Court, that the appellants have standing to challenge the Tennessee apportionment statutes.16 Beyond noting that we have no cause at this stage to doubt the District Court will be able to fashion relief if violations of constitutional rights are found, it is improper now to consider what remedy would be most appropriate if appellants prevail at the trial.\n\nII.\nJURISDICTION OF THE SUBJECT MATTER.\n\n23\nThe District Court was uncertain whether our cases withholding federal judicial relief rested upon a lack of federal jurisdiction or upon the inappropriateness of the subject matter for judicial consideration\u2014what we have designated 'nonjusticiability.' The distinction between the two grounds is significant. In the instance of nonjusticiability, consideration of the cause is not wholly and immediately foreclosed; rather, the Court's inquiry necessarily proceeds to the point of deciding whether the duty asserted can be judicially identified and its breach judicially determined, and whether protection for the right asserted can be judicially molded. In the instance of lack of jurisdiction the cause either does not 'arise under' the Federal Constitution, laws or treaties (or fall within one of the other enumerated categories of Art. III, \u00a7 2), or is not a 'case or controversy' within the meaning of that section; or the cause is not one described by any jurisdictional statute. Our conclusion, see 369 U.S., pp. 208\u2014237, 82 S.Ct., pp. 705\u2014720, infra, that this cause presents no nonjusticiable 'political question' settles the only possible doubt that it is a case or controversy. Under the present heading of 'Jurisdiction of the Subject Matter' we hold only that the matter set forth in the complaint does arise under the Constitution and is within 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343.\n\n\n24\nArticle III, \u00a7 2, of the Federal Constitution provides that 'The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority * * *.' It is clear that the cause of action is one which 'arises under' the Federal Constitution. The complaint alleges that the 1901 statute effects an apportionment that deprives the appellants of the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Dismissal of the complaint upon the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter would, therefore, be justified only if that claim were 'so attenuated and unsubstantial as to be absolutely devoid of merit,' Newburyport Water Co. v. Newburyport, 193 U.S. 561, 579, 24 S.Ct. 553, 557, 48 L.Ed. 795, or 'frivolous,' Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 683, 66 S.Ct. 773, 776, 90 L.Ed. 939.17 That the claim is unsubstantial must be 'very plain.' Hart v. B. F. Keith Vaudeville Exchange, 262 U.S. 271, 274, 43 S.Ct. 540, 541, 67 L.Ed. 977. Since the District Court obviously and correctly did not deem the asserted federal constitutional claim unsubstantial and frivolous, it should not have dismissed the complaint for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter. And of course no further consideration of the merits of the claim is relevant to a determination of the court's jurisdiction of the subject matter. We said in an earlier voting case from Tennessee: 'It is obvious * * * that the court, in dismissing for want of jurisdiction, was controlled by what it deemed to be the want of merit in the averments which were made in the complaint as to the violation of the Federal right. But as the very nature of the controversy was Federal, and, therefore, jurisdiction existed, whilst the opinion of the court as to the want of merit in the cause of action might have furnished ground for dismissing for that reason, it afforded no sufficient ground for deciding that the action was not one arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States.' Swafford v. Templeton, 185 U.S. 487, 493, 22 S.Ct. 783, 785, 46 L.Ed. 1005. 'For it is well settled that the failure to state a proper cause of action calls for a judgment on the merits and not for a dismissal for want of jurisdiction.' Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682, 66 S.Ct. 773, 776. See also Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, 263 U.S. 291, 305\u2014308, 44 S.Ct. 96, 98\u201499, 68 L.Ed. 308.\n\n\n25\nSince the complaint plaintly sets forth a case arising under the Constitution, the subject matter is within the federal judicial power defined in Art. III, \u00a7 2, and so within the power of Congress to assign to the jurisdiction of the District Courts. Congress has exercised that power in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343(3):\n\n\n26\n'The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any      civil action authorized by law18 to be commenced by any      person * * * (t)o redress the deprivation, under color of any      State law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage,      of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the      Constitution of the United States * * *.'19\n\n\n27\nAn unbroken line of our precedents sustains the federal courts' jurisdiction of the subject matter of federal constitutional claims of this nature. The first cases involved the redistricting of States for the purpose of electing Representatives to the Federal Congress. When the Ohio Supreme Court sustained Ohio legislation against an attack for repugnancy to Art. I, \u00a7 4, of the Federal Constitution, we affirmed on the merits and expressly refused to dismiss for want of jurisdiction 'In view * * * of the subject-matter of the controversy and the Federal characteristics which inhere in it * * *.' Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U.S. 565, 570, 36 S.Ct. 708, 710, 60 L.Ed. 1172. When the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of a suit to enjoin the Secretary of State of Minnesota from acting under Minnesota redistricting legislation, we reviewed the constitutional merits of the legislation and reversed the State Supreme Court. Smiley v. Holm, 285 U.S. 355, 52 S.Ct. 397, 76 L.Ed. 795. And see companion cases from the New York Court of Appeals and the Missouri Supreme Court, Koenig v. Flynn, 285 U.S. 375, 52 S.Ct. 403, 76 L.Ed. 805; Carroll v. Becker, 285 U.S. 380, 52 S.Ct. 402, 76 L.Ed. 807. When a three-judge District Court exercising jurisdiction under the predecessor of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343(3), permanently enjoined officers of the State of Mississippi from conducting an election of Representatives under a Mississippi redistricting act, we reviewed the federal questions on the merits and reversed the District Court. Wood v. Broom, 287 U.S. 1, 53 S.Ct. 1, 77 L.Ed. 131, reversing 1 F.Supp. 134. A similar decree of a District Court, exercising jurisdiction under the same statute, concerning a Kentucky redistricting act, was reviewed and the decree reversed. Mahan v. Hume, 287 U.S. 575, 53 S.Ct. 223, 77 L.Ed. 505, reversing 1 F.Supp. 142.20\n\n\n28\nThe appellees refer to Colegrove v. Green, 328 U.S. 549, 66 S.Ct. 1198, 90 L.Ed. 1432, as authority that the District Court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter. Appellees misconceive the holding of that case. The holding was precisely contrary to their reading of it. Seven members of the Court participated in the decision. Unlike many other cases in this field which have assumed without discussion that there was jurisdiction, all three opinions filed in Colegrove discussed the question. Two of the opinions expressing the views of four of the Justices, a majority, flatly held that there was jurisdiction of that subject matter. Mr. Justice Black joined by Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Murphy stated: 'It is my judgment that the District Court had jurisdiction * * *,' citing the predecessor of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343(3), and Bell v. Hood, supra. 328 U.S. at 568, 66 S.Ct. at 1210. Mr. Justice Rutledge, writing separately, expressed agreement with this conclusion. 328 U.S. at 564, 565, note 2, 66 S.Ct. at 1208. Indeed, it is even questionable that the opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter, joined by Justices Reed and Burton, doubted jurisdiction of the subject matter. Such doubt would have been inconsistent with the professed willingness to turn the decision on either the majority or concurring views in Wood v. Broom, supra. 328 U.S. at 551, 66 S.Ct. at 1199.\n\n\n29\nSeveral subsequent cases similar to Colegrove have been decided by the Court in summary per curiam statements. None was dismissed for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter. Cook v. Fortson, 329 U.S. 675, 67 S.Ct. 21, 91 L.Ed. 596; Turman v. Duckworth, ibid.; Colegrove v. Barrett, 330 U.S. 804, 67 S.Ct. 973, 91 L.Ed. 1262;21 Tedesco v. Board of Supervisors, 339 U.S. 940, 70 S.Ct. 797, 94 L.Ed. 1357; Remmey v. Smith, 342 U.S. 916, 72 S.Ct. 368, 96 L.Ed. 685; Cox v. Peters, 342 U.S. 936, 72 S.Ct. 559, 96 L.Ed. 697; Anderson v. Jordan, 343 U.S. 912, 72 S.Ct. 648, 96 L.Ed. 1328; Kidd v. McCanless, 352 U.S. 920, 77 S.Ct. 223, 1 L.Ed.2d 157; Radford v. Gary, 352 U.S. 991, 77 S.Ct. 559, 1 L.Ed.2d 540; Hartsfield v. Sloan, 357 U.S. 916, 78 S.Ct. 1363, 2 L.Ed.2d 1363; Matthews v. Handley, 361 U.S. 127, 80 S.Ct. 256, 4 L.Ed.2d 180.22\n\n\n30\nTwo cases decided with opinions after Colegrove likewise plainly imply that the subject matter of this suit is within District Court jurisdiction. In MacDougall v. Green, 335 U.S. 281, 69 S.Ct. 1, 93 L.Ed. 3, the District Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction, which had been invoked under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343(3), a suit to enjoin enforcement of the requirement that nominees for state-wide elections be supported by a petition signed by a minimum number of persons from at least 50 of the State's 102 counties. This Court's disagreement with that action is clear since the Court affirmed the judgment after a review of the merits and concluded that the particular claim there was without merit. In South v. Peters, 339 U.S. 276, 70 S.Ct. 641, 94 L.Ed. 834, we affirmed the dismissal of an attack on the Georgia 'county unit' system but founded our action on a ground that plainly would not have been reached if the lower court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, which allegedly existed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343(3). The express words of our holding were that 'Federal courts consistently refuse to exercise their equity powers in cases posing political issues arising from a state's geographical distribution of electoral strength among its political subdivisions.' 339 U.S. at 277, 70 S.Ct. at p. 642.\n\n\n31\nWe hold that the District Court has jurisdiction of the subject matter of the federal constitutional claim asserted in the complaint.\n\nIII.\n\n32\nSTANDING.\n\n\n33\nA federal court cannot 'pronounce any statute, either of a state or of the United States, void, because irreconcilable with the constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.' Liverpool, N.Y. & P. Steamship Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113 U.S. 33, 39, 5 S.Ct. 352, 355, 28 L.Ed. 899. Have the appellants alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions? This is the gist of the question of standing. It is, of course, a question of federal law.\n\n\n34\nThe complaint was filed by residents of Davidson, Hamilton, Knox, Montgomery, and Shelby Counties. Each is a person allegedly qualified to vote for members of the General Assembly representing his county.23 These appellants sued 'on their own behalf and on behalf of all qualified voters of their respective counties, and further, on behalf of all voters of the State of Tennessee who are similarly situated * * *.'24 The appellees are the Tennessee Secretary of State, Attorney General, Coordinator of Elections, and members of the State Board of Elections; the members of the State Board are sued in their own right and also as representatives of the County Election Commissioners whom they appoint.25\n\n\n35\nWe hold that the appellants do have standing to maintain this suit. Our decisions plainly support this conclusion. Many of the cases have assumed rather than articulated the premise in deciding the merits of similar claims.26 And Colegrove v. Green, supra, squarely held that voters who allege facts showing disadvantage to themselves as individuals have standing to sue.27 A number of cases decided after Colegrove recognized the standing of the voters there involved to bring those actions.28\n\n\n36\nThese appellants seek relief in order to protect or vindicate an interest of their own, and of those similarly situated. Their constitutional claim is, in substance, that the 1901 statute constitutes arbitrary and capricious state action, offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment in its irrational disregard of the standard of apportionment prescribed by the State's Constitution or of any standard, effecting a gross disproportion of representation to voting population. The injury which appellants assert is that this classification disfavors the voters in the counties in which they reside, placing them in a position of constitutionally unjustifiable inequality vis-a -vis voters in irrationally favored counties. A citizen's right to a vote free of arbitrary impairment by state action has been judicially recognized as a right secured by the Constitution, when such impairment resulted from dilution by a false tally, cf. United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 85 L.Ed. 1368; or by a refusal to count votes from arbitrarily selected precincts, cf. United States v. Mosley, 238 U.S. 383, 35 S.Ct. 904, 59 L.Ed. 1355, or by a stuffing of the ballot box, cf. Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 25 L.Ed. 717; United States v. Saylor, 322 U.S. 385, 64 S.Ct. 1101, 88 L.Ed. 1341.\n\n\n37\nIt would not be necessary to decide whether appellants' allegations of impairment of their votes by the 1901 apportionment will, ultimately, entitle them to any relief, in order to hold that they have standing to seek it. If such impairment does produce a legally cognizable injury, they are among those who have sustained it. They are asserting 'a plain, direct and adequate interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes,' Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. at 438, 59 S.Ct. at p. 975 not merely a claim of 'the right possessed by every citizen 'to require that the government be administered according to law * * *'.' Fairchild v. Hughes, 258 U.S. 126, 129, 42 S.Ct. 274, 275, 66 L.Ed. 499; compare Leser v. Garnett, 258 U.S. 130, 42 S.Ct. 217, 66 L.Ed. 505. They are entitled to a hearing and to the District Court's decision on their claims. 'The very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury.' Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 163, 2 L.Ed. 60.\n\nIV.\n\n38\nJUSTICIABILITY.\n\n\n39\nIn holding that the subject matter of this suit was not justiciable, the District Court relied on Colegrove v. Green, supra, and subsequent per curiam cases.29 The court stated: 'From a review of these decisions there can be no doubt that the federal rule * * * is that the federal courts * * * will not intervene in cases of this type to compel legislative reapportionment.' 179 F.Supp. at 826. We understand the District Court to have read the cited cases as compelling the conclusion that since the appellants sought to have a legislative apportionment held unconstitutional, their suit presented a 'political question' and was therefore nonjusticiable. We hold that this challenge to an apportionment presents no nonjusticiable 'political question.' The cited cases do not hold the contrary.\n\n\n40\nOf course the mere fact that the suit seeks protection of a political right does not mean it presents a political question. Such an objection 'is little more than a play upon words.' Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U.S. 536, 540, 47 S.Ct. 446, 71 L.Ed. 759. Rather, it is argued that apportionment cases, whatever the actual wording of the complaint, can involve no federal constitutional right except one resting on the guaranty of a republican form of government,30 and that complaints based on that clause have been held to present political questions which are nonjusticiable.\n\n\n41\nWe hold that the claim pleaded here neither rests upon nor implicates the Guaranty Clause and that its justiciability is therefore not foreclosed by our decisions of cases involving that clause. The District Court misinterpreted Colegrove v. Green and other decisions of this Court on which it relied. Appellants' claim that they are being denied equal protection is justiciable, and if 'discrimination is sufficiently shown, the right to relief under the equal protection clause is not diminished by the fact that the discrimination relates to political rights.' Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 11, 64 S.Ct. 397, 402, 88 L.Ed. 497. To show why we reject the argument based on the Guaranty Clause, we must examine the authorities under it. But because there appears to be some uncertainty as to why those cases did present political questions, and specifically as to whether this apportionment case is like those cases, we deem it necessary first to consider the contours of the 'political question' doctrine.\n\n\n42\nOur discussion, even at the price of extending this opinion, requires review of a number of political question cases, in order to expose the attributes of the doctrine\u2014attributes which, in various settings, diverge, combine, appear, and disappear in seeming disorderliness. Since that review is undertaken solely to demonstrate that neither singly nor collectively do these cases support a conclusion that this apportionment case is nonjusticiable, we of course do not explore their implications in other contexts. That review reveals that in the Guaranty Clause cases and in the other 'political question' cases, it is the relationship between the judiciary and the coordinate branches of the Federal Government, and not the federal judiciary's relationship to the States, which gives rise to the 'political question.'\n\n\n43\nWe have said that 'In determining whether a question falls within (the political question) category, the appropriateness under our system of government of attributing finality to the action of the political departments and also the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination are dominant considerations.' Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433, 454\u2014455, 59 S.Ct. 972, 982, 83 L.Ed. 1385. The nonjusticiability of a political question is primarily a function of the separation of powers. Much confusion results from the capacity of the 'political question' label to obscure the need for case-by-case inquiry. Deciding whether a matter has in any measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch of government, or whether the action of that branch exceeds whatever authority has been committed, is itself a delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation, and is a responsibility of this Court as ultimate interpreter of the Constitution. To demonstrate this requires no less than to analyze representative cases and to infer from them the analytical threads that make up the political question doctrine. We shall then show that none of those threads catches this case.\n\n\n44\nForeign relations: There are sweeping statements to the effect that all questions touching foreign relations are political questions.31 Not only does resolution of such issues frequently turn on standards that defy judicial application, or involve the exercise of a discretion demonstrably committed to the executive or legislature;32 but many such questions uniquely demand single-voiced statement of the Government's views.33 Yet it is error to suppose that every case or controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance. Our cases in this field seem invariably to show a discriminating analysis of the particular question posed, in terms of the history of its management by the political branches, of its susceptibility to judicial handling in the light of its nature and posture in the specific case, and of the possible consequences of judicial action. For example, though a court will not ordinarily inquire whether a treaty has been terminated, since on that question 'governmental action * * * must be regarded as of controlling importance,' if there has been no conclusive 'governmental action' then a court can construe a treaty and may find it provides the answer. Compare Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U.S. 270, 285, 22 S.Ct. 484, 490, 46 L.Ed. 534, with Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts v. New Haven, 8 Wheat. 464, 492\u2014495, 5 L.Ed. 662.34 Though a court will not undertake to construe a treaty in a manner inconsistent with a subsequent federal statute, no similar hesitancy obtains if the asserted clash is with state law. Compare Whitney v. Robertson, 124 U.S. 190, 8 S.Ct. 456, 31 L.Ed. 386, with Kolovrat v. Oregon, 366 U.S. 187, 81 S.Ct. 922, 6 L.Ed.2d 218.\n\n\n45\nWhile recognition of foreign governments so strongly defies judicial treatment that without executive recognition a foreign state has been called 'a republic of whose existence we know nothing,'35 and the judiciary ordinarily follows the executive as to which nation has sovereignty over disputed territory,36 once sovereignty over an area is politically determined and declared, courts may examine the resulting status and decide independently whether a statute applies to that area.37 Similarly, recognition of belligerency abroad is an executive responsibility, but if the executive proclamations fall short of an explicit answer, a court may construe them seeking, for example, to determine whether the situation is such that statutes designed to assure American neutrality have become operative. The Three Friends, 166 U.S. 1, 63, 66, 17 S.Ct. 495, 502, 503, 41 L.Ed. 497. Still again, though it is the executive that determines a person's status as representative of a foreign government, Ex parte Hitz, 111 U.S. 766, 4 S.Ct. 698, 28 L.Ed. 592, the executive's statements will be construed where necessary to determine the court's jurisdiction, In re Baiz, 135 U.S. 403, 10 S.Ct. 854, 34 L.Ed. 222. Similar judicial action in the absence of a recognizedly authoritative executive declaration occurs in cases involving the immunity from seizure of vessels owned by friendly foreign governments. Compare Ex parte Republic of Peru, 318 U.S. 578, 63 S.Ct. 793, 87 L.Ed. 1014, with Mexico v. Hoffman, 324 U.S. 30, 34\u201435, 65 S.Ct. 530, 532, 89 L.Ed. 729.\n\n\n46\nDates of duration of hostilities: Though it has been stated broadly that 'the power which declared the necessity is the power to declare its cessation, and what the cessation requires,' Commercial Trust Co. v. Miller, 262 U.S. 51, 57, 43 S.Ct. 486, 488, 489, 67 L.Ed. 858, here too analysis reveals isolable reasons for the presence of political questions, underlying this Court's refusal to review the political departments' determination of when or whether a war has ended. Dominant is the need for finality in the political determination, for emergency's nature demands 'A prompt and unhesitating obedience,' Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19, 30, 6 L.Ed. 537 (calling up of militia). Moreover, 'the cessation of hostilities does not necessarily end the war power. It was stated in Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & W. Co., 251 U.S. 146, 161, 40 S.Ct. 106, 110, 64 L.Ed. 194, that the war power includes the power 'to remedy the evils which have arisen from its rise and progress' and continues during that emergency. Stewart v. Kahn, 11 Wall. 493, 507, 20 L.Ed. 176.' Fleming v. Mohawk Wrecking Co., 331 U.S. 111, 116, 67 S.Ct. 1129, 1132, 91 L.Ed. 1375. But deference rests on reason, not habit.38 The question in a particular case may not seriously implicate considerations of finality\u2014e.g., a public program of importance (rent control) yet not central to the emergency effort.39 Further, clearly definable criteria for decision may be available. In such case the political question barrier falls away: '(A) Court is not at liberty to shut its eyes to an obvious mistake, when the validity of the law depends upon the truth of what is declared. * * * (It can) inquire whether the exigency still existed upon which the continued operation of the law depended.' Chastleton Corp. v. Sinclair, 264 U.S. 543, 547\u2014548, 44 S.Ct. 405, 406, 68 L.Ed. 841.40 Compare Woods v. Cloyd W. Miller Co., 333 U.S. 138, 68 S.Ct. 421, 92 L.Ed. 596. On the other hand, even in private litigation which directly implicates no feature of separation of powers, lack of judicially discoverable standards and the drive for even-handed application may impel reference to the political departments' determination of dates of hostilities' beginning and ending. The Protector, 12 Wall. 700, 20 L.Ed. 463.\n\n\n47\nValidity of enactments: In Coleman v. Miller, supra, this Court held that the questions of how long a proposed amendment to the Federal Constitution remained open to ratification, and what effect a prior rejection had on a subsequent ratification, were committed to congressional resolution and involved criteria of decision that necessarily escaped the judicial grasp.41 Similar considerations apply to the enacting process: 'The respect due to coequal and independent departments,' and the need for finality and certainty about the status of a statute contribute to judicial reluctance to inquire whether, as passed, it complied with all requisite formalities. Field v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649, 672, 676\u2014677, 12 S.Ct. 495, 497, 499, 36 L.Ed. 294; see Leser v. Garnett, 258 U.S. 130, 137, 42 S.Ct. 217, 218, 66 L.Ed. 505. But it is not true that courts will never delve into a legislature's records upon such a quest: If the enrolled statute lacks an effective date, a court will not hesitate to seek it in the legislative journals in order to preserve the enactment. Gardner v. Collector, 6 Wall. 499, 18 L.Ed. 890. The political question doctrine, a tool for maintenance of governmental order, will not be so applied as to promote only disorder.\n\n\n48\nThe status of Indian tribes: This Court's deference to the political departments in determining whether Indians are recognized as a tribe, while it reflects familiar attributes of political questions,42 United States v. Holliday, 3 Wall. 407, 419, 18 L.Ed. 182, also has a unique element in that 'the relation of the Indians to the United States is marked by peculiar and cardinal distinctions which exist no where else. * * * (The Indians are) domestic dependent nations * * * in a state of pupilage. Their relation to the United States resembles that of a ward to his guardian.' Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 16, 17, 8 L.Ed. 25.43 Yet, here too, there is no blanket rule.\n\n\n49\nWhile \"It is for (Congress) * * *, and not for the courts, to determine when the true interests of the Indian require his release from (the) condition of tutelage' * * *, it is not meant by this that Congress may bring a community or body of people within the range of this power by arbitrarily calling them an Indian tribe * * *.' United States v. Sandoval, 231 U.S. 28, 46, 34 S.Ct. 1, 6, 58 L.Ed. 107. Able to discern what is 'distinctly Indian,' ibid., the courts will strike down any heedless extension of that label. They will not stand impotent before an obvious instance of a manifestly unauthorized exercise of power.\n\n\n50\nIt is apparent that several formulations which vary slightly according to the settings in which the questions arise may describe a political question, although each has one or more elements which identify it as essentially a function of the separation of powers. Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.\n\n\n51\nUnless one of these formulations is inextricable from the case at bar, there should be no dismissal for non-justiciability on the ground of a political question's presence. The doctrine of which we treat is one of 'political questions,' not one of 'political cases.' The courts cannot reject as 'no law suit' a bona fide controversy as to whether some action denominated 'political' exceeds constitutional authority. The cases we have reviewed show the necessity for discriminating inquiry into the precise facts and posture of the particular case, and the impossibility of resolution by any semantic cataloguing.\n\n\n52\nBut it is argued that this case shares the characteristics of decisions that constitute a category not yet considered, cases concerning the Constitution's guaranty, in Art. IV, s 4, of a republican form of government. A conclusion as to whether the case at bar does present a political question cannot be confidently reached until we have considered those cases with special care. We shall discover that Guaranty Clause claims involve those elements which define a 'political question,' and for that reason and no other, they are nonjusticiable. In particular, we shall discover that the nonjusticiability of such claims has nothing to do with their touching upon matters of state governmental organization.\n\n\n53\nRepublican form of government: Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 12 L.Ed. 581, though in form simply an action for damages for trespass was, as Daniel Webster said in opening the argument for the defense, 'an unusual case.'44 The defendants, admitting an otherwise tortious breaking and entering, sought to justify their action on the ground that they were agents of the established lawful government of Rhode Island, which State was then under martial law to defend itself from active insurrection; that the plaintiff was engaged in that insurrection; and that they entered under orders to arrest the plaintiff. The case arose 'out of the unfortunate political differences which agitated the people of Rhode Island in 1841 and 1842,' 7 How., at 34, and which had resulted in a situation wherein two groups laid competing claims to recognition as the lawful government.45 The plaintiff's right to recover depended upon which of the two groups was entitled to such recognition; but the lower court's refusal to receive evidence or hear argument on that issue, its charge to the jury that the earlier established or 'charter' government was lawful, and the verdict for the defendants, were affirmed upon appeal to this Court.\n\n\n54\nChief Justice Taney's opinion for the Court reasoned as follows: (1) If a court were to hold the defendants' acts unjustified because the charter government had no legal existence during the period in question, it would follow that all of that government's actions\u2014laws enacted, taxes collected, salaries paid, accounts settled, sentences passed\u2014were of no effect; and that 'the officers who carried their decisions into operation (were) answerable as trespassers, if not in some cases as criminals.'46 There was, of course, no room for application of any doctrine of de facto status to uphold prior acts of an officer not authorized de jure, for such would have defeated the plaintiff's very action. A decision for the plaintiff would inevitably have produced some significant measure of chaos, a consequence to be avoided if it could be done without abnegation of the judicial duty to uphold the Constitution.\n\n\n55\n(2) No state court had recognized as a judicial responsibility settlement of the issue of the locus of state governmental authority. Indeed, the courts of Rhode Island had in several cases held that 'it rested with the political power to decide whether the charter government had been displaced or not,' and that that department had acknowledged no change.\n\n\n56\n(3) Since '(t)he question relates, altogether, to the constitution and laws of (the) * * * State,' the courts of the United States had to follow the state courts' decisions unless there was a federal constitutional ground for overturning them.47\n\n\n57\n(4) No provision of the Constitution could be or had been invoked for this purpose except Art. IV, \u00a7 4, the Guaranty Clause. Having already noted the absence of standards whereby the choice between governments could be made by a court acting independently, Chief Justice Taney now found further textual and practical reasons for concluding that, if any department of the United States was empowered by the Guaranty Clause to resolve the issue, it was not the judiciary:\n\n\n58\n'Under this article of the Constitution it rests with      Congress to decide what government is the established one in      a State. For as the United States guarantee to each State a      republican government, Congress must necessarily decide what      government is established in the State before it can      determine whether it is republican or not. And when the      senators and representatives of a State are admitted into the      councils of the Union, the authority of the government under      which they are appointed, as well as its republican      character, is recognized by the proper constitutional      authority. And its decision is binding on every other      department of the government, and could not be questioned in      a judicial tribunal. It is true that the contest in this case      did not last long enough to bring the matter to this issue;      and * * * Congress was not called upon to decide the      controversy. Yet the right to decide is placed there, and not      in the courts.\n\n\n59\n'So, too, as relates to the clause in the           above-mentioned article of the Constitution, providing           for cases of demestic violence. It rested with Congress,           too, to determine upon the means proper to be adopted to           fulfill this guarantee. * * * (B)y the act of February           28, 1795, (Congress) provided, that, 'in case of an           insurrection in any State against the government           thereof, it shall be lawful for the President of the           United States, on application of the legislature of such           State or of the executive (when the legislature cannot           be convened) to call forth such number of the militia of           any other State or States, as may be applied for, as he           may judge sufficient to suppress such insurrection.'\n\n\n60\n'By this act, the power of deciding whether the exigency had      arisen upon which the government of the United States is      bound to interfere, is given to the President. * * *\n\n\n61\n'After the President has acted and called out the militia, is      a Circuit Court of the United States authorized to inquire      whether his decision was right? * * * If the judicial power      extends so far, the guarantee contained in the Constitution      of the United States is a guarantee of anarchy, and not of      order. * * *\n\n\n62\n'It is true that in this case the militia were not called out      by the President. But upon the application of the governor      under the charter government, the President recognized him as      the executive power of the State, and took measures to call      out the militia to support his authority if it should be      found necessary for the general government to interfere * *      *. (C)ertainly no court of the United States, with a      knowledge of this decision, would have been justified in      recognizing the opposing party as the lawful government * * *. In the case of foreign nations, the government      acknowledged by the President is always recognized in the      courts of justice. * * *' 7 How., at 42\u201444.\n\n\n63\nClearly, several factors were thought by the Court in Luther to make the question there 'political': the commitment to the other branches of the decision as to which is the lawful state government; the unambiguous action by the President, in recognizing the charter government as the lawful authority; the need for finality in the executive's decision; and the lack of criteria by which a court could determine which form of government was republican.48\n\n\n64\nBut the only significance that Luther could have for our immediate purposes is in its holding that the Guaranty Clause is not a repository of judicially manageable standards which a court could utilize independently in order to identify a State's lawful government. The Court has since refused to resort to the Guaranty Clause\u2014which alone had been invoked for the purpose\u2014as the source of a constitutional standard for invalidating state action. See Taylor & Marshall v. Beckham (No. 1), 178 U.S. 548, 20 S.Ct. 890, 44 L.Ed. 1187 (claim that Kentucky's resolution of contested gubernatorial election deprived voters of republican government held nonjusticiable); Pacific States Tel. & T. Co. v. Oregon, 223 U.S. 118, 32 S.Ct. 224, 56 L.Ed. 377 (claim that initiative and referendum negated republican government held nonjusticiable); Kiernan v. Portland, 223 U.S. 151, 32 S.Ct. 231, 56 L.Ed. 386 (claim that municipal charter amendment per municipal initiative and referendum negated republican government held nonjusticiable); Marshall v. Dye, 231 U.S. 250, 34 S.Ct. 92, 58 L.Ed. 206 (claim that Indiana's constitutional amendment procedure negated republican government held nonjusticiable); O'Neill v. Leamer, 239 U.S. 244, 36 S.Ct. 54, 60 L.Ed. 249 (claim that delegation to court of power to form drainage districts negated republican government held 'futile'); Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U.S. 565, 36 S.Ct. 708, 60 L.Ed. 1172 (claim that invalidation of state reapportionment statute per referendum negates republican government held nonjusticiable);49 Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, 243 U.S. 219, 37 S.Ct. 260, 61 L.Ed. 685 (claim that workmen's compensation violates republican government held nonjusticiable); Ohio ex rel. Bryant v. Akron Metropolitan Park District, 281 U.S. 74, 50 S.Ct. 228, 74 L.Ed. 710 (claim that rule requiring invalidation of statute by all but one justice of state court negated republican government held nonjusticiable); Highland Farms Dairy v. Agnew, 300 U.S. 608, 57 S.Ct. 549, 81 L.Ed. 835 (claim that delegation to agency of power to control milk prices violated republican government, rejected).\n\n\n65\nJust as the Court has consistently held that a challenge to state action based on the Guaranty Clause presents no justiciable question so has it held, and for the same reasons, that challenges to congressional action on the ground of inconsistency with that clause present no justiciable question. In Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, 18 L.Ed. 721, the State sought by an original bill to enjoin execution of the Reconstruction Acts, claiming that it already possessed 'A republican State, in every political, legal, constitutional, and juridical sense,' and that enforcement of the new Acts 'Instead of keeping the guaranty against a forcible overthrow of its government by foreign invaders or domestic insurgents, * * * is destroying that very government by force.'50 Congress had clearly refused to recognize the republican character of the government of the suing State.51 It seemed to the Court that the only constitutional claim that could be presented was under the Guaranty Clause, and Congress having determined that the effects of the recent hostilities required extraordinary measures to restore governments of a republican form, this Court refused to interfere with Congress' action at the behest of a claimant relying on that very guaranty.52\n\n\n66\nIn only a few other cases has the Court considered Art. IV, \u00a7 4, in relation to congressional action. It has refused to pass on a claim relying on the Guaranty Clause to establish that Congress lacked power to allow the States to employ the referendum in passing on legislation redistricting for congressional seats. Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, supra. And it has pointed out that Congress is not required to establish republican government in the territories before they become States, and before they have attained a sufficient population to warrant a polularly elected legislature. Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244, 278\u2014279, 21 S.Ct. 770, 783\u2014784, 45 L.Ed. 1088 (dictum).53\n\n\n67\nWe come, finally, to the ultimate inquiry whether our precedents as to what constitutes a nonjusticiable 'political question' bring the case before us under the umbrella of that doctrine. A natural beginning is to note whether any of the common characteristics which we have been able to identify and label descriptively are present. We find none: The question here is the consistency of state action with the Federal Constitution. We have no question decided, or to be decided, by a political branch of government coequal with this Court. Nor do we risk embarrassment of our government abroad, or grave disturbance at home54 if we take issue with Tennessee as to the constitutionality of her action here challenged. Nor need the appellants, in order to succeed in this action, ask the Court to enter upon policy determinations for which judicially manageable standards are lacking. Judicial standards under the Equal Protection Clause are well developed and familiar, and it has been open to courts since the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment to determine, if on the particular facts they must, that a discrimination reflects no policy, but simply arbitrary and capricious action.\n\n\n68\nThis case does, in one sense, involve the allocation of political power within a State, and the appellants might conceivably have added a claim under the Guaranty Clause. Of course, as we have seen, any reliance on that clause would be futile. But because any reliance on the Guaranty Clause could not have succeeded it does not follow that appellants may not be heard on the equal protection claim which in fact they tender. True, it must be clear that the Fourteenth Amendment claim is not so enmeshed with those political question elements which render Guaranty Clause claims nonjusticiable as actually to present a political question itself. But we have found that not to be the case here.\n\n\n69\nIn this connection special attention is due Pacific States Tel. & T. Co. v. Oregon, 223 U.S. 118, 32 S.Ct. 224, 56 L.Ed. 377. In that case a corporation tax statute enacted by the initiative was attacked ostensibly on three grounds: (1) due process; (2) equal protection; and (3) the Guaranty Clause. But it was clear that the first two grounds were invoked solely in aid of the contention that the tax was invalid by reason of its passage:\n\n\n70\n'The defendant company does not contend here that it could      not have been required to pay a license tax. It does not      assert that it was denied an opportunity to be heard as to      the amount for which it was taxed, or that there was anything      inhering in the tax or involved intrinsically in the law      which violated any of its constitutional rights. If such      questions had been raised, they would have been justiciable,      and therefore would have required the calling into operation      of judicial power. Instead, however, of doing any of these      things, the attack on the statute here made is of a wholly      different character. Its essentially political nature is at      once made manifest by understanding that the assault which      the contention here advanced makes it (sic) not on the tax as      a tax, but on the state as a state. It is addressed to the framework and political character of the government by which      the statute levying the tax was passed. It is the government,      the political entity, which (reducing the case to its      essence) is called to the bar of this court, not for the      purpose of testing judicially some exercise of power,      assailed on the ground that its exertion has injuriously      affected the rights of an individual because of repugnancy to      some constitutional limitation, but to demand of the state      that it establish its right to exist as a State, republican      in form.' 223 U.S. at 150\u2014151, 32 S.Ct. at 231.\n\n\n71\nThe due process and equal protection claims were held nonjusticiable in Pacific States not because they happened to be joined with a Guaranty Clause claim, or because they sought to place before the Court a subject matter which might conceivably have been dealt with through the Guaranty Clause, but because the Court believed that they were invoked merely in verbal aid of the resolution of issues which, in its view, entailed political questions. Pacific States may be compared with cases such as Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, 243 U.S. 219, 37 S.Ct. 260, 61 L.Ed. 685, wherein the Court refused to consider whether a workmen's compensation act violated the Guaranty Clause but considered at length, and rejected, due process and equal protection arguments advanced against it; and O'Neill v. Leamer, 239 U.S. 244, 36 S.Ct. 54, 60 L.Ed. 249, wherein the Court refused to consider whether Nebraska's delegation of power to form drainage districts violated the Guaranty Clause, but went on to consider and reject the contention that the action against which an injunction was sought was not a taking for a public purpose.\n\n\n72\nWe conclude then that the nonjusticiability of claims resting on the Guaranty Clause which arises from their embodiment of questions that were thought 'political,' can have no bearing upon the justiciability of the equal protection claim presented in this case. Finally, we emphasize that it is the involvement in Guaranty Clause claims of the elements thought to define 'political questions,' and no other feature, which could render them nonjusticiable. Specifically, we have said that such claims are not held nonjusticiable because they touch matters of state governmental organization. Brief examination of a few cases demonstrates this.\n\n\n73\nWhen challenges to state action respecting matters of 'the administration of the affairs of the State and the officers through whom they are conducted'55 have rested on claims of constitutional deprivation which are amenable to judicial correction, this Court has acted upon its view of the merits of the claim. For example, in Boyd v. Nebraska ex rel. Thayer, 143 U.S. 135, 12 S.Ct. 375, we reversed the Nebraska Supreme Court's decision that Nebraska's Governor was not a citizen of the United States or of the State and therefore could not continue in office. In Kennard v. Louisiana ex rel. Morgan, 92 U.S. 480, 23 L.Ed. 478, and Foster v. Kansas ex rel. Johnston, 112 U.S. 201, 5 S.Ct. 8, 28 L.Ed. 629, we considered whether persons had been removed from public office by procedures consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment's due process guaranty, and held on the merits that they had. And only last Term, in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110, we applied the Fifteenth Amendment to strike down a redrafting of municipal boundaries which effected a discriminatory impairment of voting rights, in the face of what a majority of the Court of Appeals thought to be a sweeping commitment to state legislatures of the power to draw and redraw such boundaries.56\n\n\n74\nGomillion was brought by a Negro who had been a resident of the City of Tuskegee, Alabama, until the municipal boundaries were so recast by the State Legislature as to exclude practically all Negroes. The plaintiff claimed deprivation of the right to vote in municipal elections. The District Court's, 167 F.Supp. 405, dismissal for want of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 5 Cir., 270 F.2d 594. This Court unanimously reversed. This Court's answer to the argument that States enjoyed unrestricted control over municipal boundaries was:\n\n\n75\n'Legislative control of municipalities, no less than other      state power, lies within the scope of relevant limitations      imposed by the United States Constitution. * * * The opposite      conclusion, urged upon us by respondents, would sanction the      achievement by a State of any impairment of voting rights      whatever so long as it was cloaked in the garb of the      realignment of political subdivisions. 'It is inconceivable      that guaranties embedded in the Constitution of the United      States may thus be manipulated out of existence.\" 364 U.S. at      344\u2014345, 81 S.Ct. at 129.\n\n\n76\nTo a second argument, that Colegrove v. Green, supra, was a barrier to hearing the merits of the case, the Court responded that Gomillion was lifted 'out of the so-called 'political' arena and into the conventional sphere of constitutional litigation' because here was discriminatory treatment of a racial minority violating the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\n\n77\n'A statute which is alleged to have worked unconstitutional      deprivations of petitioners' rights is not immune to attack      simply because the mechanism employed by the legislature is a      redefinition of municipal boundaries. * * * While in form      this is merely an act redefining metes and bounds, if the      allegations are established, the inescapable human effect of      this essay in geometry and geography is to despoil colored      citizens, and only colored citizens, of their theretofore enjoyed voting rights. That was not      Colegrove v. Green.\n\n\n78\n'When a State exercises power wholly within the domain of      state interest, it is insulated from federal judicial review.      But such insulation is not carried over when state power is      used as an instrument for circumventing a federally protected      right.' 364 U.S. at 347, 81 S.Ct. at 130.57\n\n\n79\nWe have not overlooked such cases as In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 8 S.Ct. 482, 31 L.Ed. 402, and Walton v. House of Representatives, 265 U.S. 487, 44 S.Ct. 628, 68 L.Ed. 1115, which held that federal equity power could not be exercised to enjoin a state proceeding to remove a public officer. But these decisions explicitly reflect only a traditional limit upon equity jurisdiction, and not upon federal courts' power to inquire into matters of state governmental organization. This is clear not only from the opinions in those cases, but also from White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366, 18 S.Ct. 917, 43 L.Ed. 199, which, relying on Sawyer, withheld federal equity from staying removal of a federal officer. Wilson v. North Carolina, 169 U.S. 586, 18 S.Ct. 435, 42 L.Ed. 865, simply dismissed an appeal from an unsuccessful suit to upset a State's removal procedure, on the ground that the constitutional claim presented\u2014that a jury trial was necessary if the removal procedure was to comport with due process requirements was frivolous. Finally, in Taylor and Marshall v. Beckham (No. 1), 178 U.S. 548, 20 S.Ct. 890, 1009, 44 L.Ed. 1187, where losing candidates attacked the constitutionality of Kentucky's resolution of a contested gubernatorial election, the Court refused to consider the merits of a claim posited upon the Guaranty Clause, holding it presented a political question, but also held on the merits that the ousted candidates had suffered no deprivation of property without due process of law.58\n\n\n80\nSince, as has been established, the equal protection claim tendered in this case does not require decision of any political question, and since the presence of a matter affecting state government does not render the case nonjusticiable, it seems appropriate to examine again the reasoning by which the District Court reached its conclusion that the case was nonjusticiable.\n\n\n81\nWe have already noted that the District Court's holding that the subject matter of this complaint was nonjusticiable relied upon Colegrove v. Green, supra, and later cases. Some of those concerned the choice of members of a state legislature, as in this case; others, like Colegrove itself and earlier precedents, Smiley v. Holm, 285 U.S. 355, 52 S.Ct. 397, 76 L.Ed. 795; Koenig v. Flynn, 285 U.S. 375, 52 S.Ct. 403, 76 L.Ed. 805, and Carroll v. Becker, 285 U.S. 380, 52 S.Ct. 402, 76 L.Ed. 807, concerned the choice of Representatives in the Federal Congress. Smiley, Koenig and Carroll settled the issue in favor of justiciability of questions of congressional redistricting. The Court followed these precedents in Colegrove although over the dissent of three of the seven Justices who participated in that decision. On the issue of justiciability, all four Justices comprising a majority relied upon Smiley v. Holm, but in two opinions, one for three Justices, 328 U.S. at 566, 568, 66 S.Ct. at 1209, and a separate one by Mr. Justice Rutledge, 328 U.S. at 564, 66 S.Ct. at 1208. The argument that congressional redistricting problems presented a 'political question' the resolution of which was confided to Congress might have been rested upon Art. I, \u00a7 4, Art. I, \u00a7 5, Art. I, \u00a7 2, and Amendment XIV, \u00a7 2. Mr. Justice Rutledge said: 'But for the ruling in Smiley v. Holm, 285 U.S. 355, 52 S.Ct. 397, 76 L.Ed. 795, I should have supposed that the provisions of the Constitution, Art. I, \u00a7 4, that 'The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for * * * Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations * * *'; Art. I, \u00a7 2 (but see Amendment XIV, \u00a7 2), vesting in Congress the duty of apportionment of representatives among the several states 'according to their respective Numbers'; and Art. I, \u00a7 5, making each house the sole judge of the qualifications of its own members, would remove the issues in this case from justiciable cognizance. But, in my judgment, the Smiley case rules squarely to the contrary, save only in the matter of degree. * * * Assuming that that decision is to stand, I think * * * that its effect is to rule that this Court has power to afford relief in a case of this type as against the objection that the issues are not justiciable.' 328 U.S. at 564 565, 66 S.Ct. at 1208. Accordingly, Mr. Justice Rutledge joined in the conclusion that the case was justiciable, although he held that the dismissal of the complaint should be affirmed. His view was that 'The shortness of the time remaining (before forthcoming elections) makes it doubtful whether action could, or would, be taken in time to secure for petitioners the effective relief they seek. * * * I think, therefore, the case is one in which the Court may properly, and should, decline to exercise its jurisdiction. Accordingly, the judgment should be affirmed and I join in that disposition of the cause.' 328 U.S., at 565\u2014566, 66 S.Ct. at 1208.59\n\n\n82\nArticle I, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 4, and 5, and Amendment XIV, \u00a7 2, relate only to congressional elections and obviously do not govern apportionment of state legislatures. However, our decisions in favor of justiciability even in light of those provisions plainly afford no support for the District Court's conclusion that the subject matter of this controversy presents a political question. Indeed, the refusal to award relief in Colegrove resulted only from the controlling view of a want of equity. Nor is anything contrary to be found in those per curiams that came after Colegrove. This Court dismissed the appeals in Cook v. Fortson (Turman v. Duckworth), 329 U.S. 675, 67 S.Ct. 21, 91 L.Ed. 596, as moot. MacDougall v. Green, 335 U.S. 281, 69 S.Ct. 1, 93 L.Ed. 3, held only that in that case equity would not act to void the State's requirement that there be at least a minimum of support for nominees for state-wide office, over at least a minimal area of the State. Problems of timing were critical in Remmey v. Smith, 342 U.S. 916, 72 S.Ct. 368, 96 L.Ed. 685, dismissing for want of a substantial federal question a three-judge court's dismissal of the suit as prematurely brought, D.C., 102 F.Supp. 708; and in Hartsfield v. Sloan, 357 U.S. 916, 78 S.Ct. 1363, 2 L.Ed.2d 1363, denying mandamus sought to compel the convening of a three-judge court\u2014movants urged the Court to advance consideration of their case 'Inasmuch as the mere lapse of time before this case can be reached in the normal course of * * * business may defeat the cause, and inasmuch as the time problem is due to the inherent nature of the case * * *.' South v. Peters, 339 U.S. 276, 70 S.Ct. 641, 94 L.Ed. 834, like Colegrove appears to be a refusal to exercise equity's powers; see the statement of the holding, quoted, supra, 369 U.S., p. 203, 82 S.Ct. p. 703. And Cox v. Peters, 342 U.S. 936, 72 S.Ct. 559, 96 L.Ed. 697, dismissed for want of a substantial federal question the appeal from the state court's holding that their primary elections implicated no 'state action.' See 208 Ga. 498, 67 S.E.2d 579. But compare Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461, 73 S.Ct. 809, 97 L.Ed. 1152\n\n\n83\nTedesco v. Board of Supervisors, 339 U.S. 940, 70 S.Ct. 797, 94 L.Ed. 1357, indicates solely that no substantial federal question was raised by a state court's refusal to upset the districting of city council seats, especially as it was urged that there was a rational justification for the challenged districting. See La.App., 43 So.2d 514. Similarly, in Anderson v. Jordan, 343 U.S. 912, 72 S.Ct. 648, 96 L.Ed. 1328, it was certain only that the state court had refused to issue a discretionary writ, original mandamus in the Supreme Court. That had been denied without opinion, and of course it was urged here that an adequate state ground barred this Court's review. And in Kidd v. McCanless, 200 Tenn. 273, 292 S.W.2d 40, the Supreme Court of Tennessee held that it could not invalidate the very statute at issue in the case at bar, but its holding rested on its state law of remedies, i.e., the state view of de facto officers,60 and not on any view that the norm for legislative apportionment in Tennessee is not numbers of qualified voters resident in the several counties. Of course this Court was there precluded by the adequate state ground, and in dismissing the appeal, 352 U.S. 920, 77 S.Ct. 223, 1 L.Ed.2d 157, we cited Anderson, supra, as well as Colegrove. Nor does the Tennessee court's decision in that case bear upon this, for just as in Smith v. Holm, 220 Minn. 486, 19 N.W.2d 914, and Magraw v. Donovan, D.C., 163 F.Supp. 184; D.C., 177 F.Supp. 803, a state court's inability to grant relief does not bar a federal court's assuming jurisdiction to inquire into alleged deprivation of federal constitutional rights. Problems of relief also controlled in Radford v. Gary, 352 U.S. 991, 77 S.Ct. 559, 1 L.Ed.2d 540, affirming the District Court's refusal to mandamus the Governor to call a session of the legislature, to mandamus the legislature then to apportion, and if they did not comply, to mandamus the State Supreme Court to do so. And Matthews v. Handley, 361 U.S. 127, 80 S.Ct. 256, 4 L.Ed.2d 180, affirmed a refusal to strike down the State's gross income tax statute\u2014urged on the ground that the legislature was malapportioned\u2014that had rested on the adequacy of available state legal remedies for suits involving that tax, including challenges to its constitutionality. Lastly, Colegrove v. Barrett, 330 U.S. 804, 67 S.Ct. 973, 91 L.Ed. 1262, in which Mr. Justice Rutledge concurred in this Court's refusal to note the appeal from a dismissal for want of equity, is sufficiently explained by his statement in Cook v. Fortson, supra: 'The discretionary exercise or nonexercise of equitable or declaratory judgment jurisdiction * * * in one case is not precedent in another case where the facts differ.' 329 U.S. at 678, n. 8, 67 S.Ct. 21, at 22, 91 L.Ed. 596. (Citations omitted.)\n\n\n84\nWe conclude that the complaint's allegations of a denial of equal protection present a justiciable constitutional cause of action upon which appellants are entitled to a trial and a decision. The right asserted is within the reach of judicial protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n85\nThe judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n86\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n87\nMr. Justice WHITTAKER did not participate in the decision of this case.\n\nAPPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT\n\n88\nThe Tennessee Code Annotated provides for representation in the General Assembly as follows:\n\n\n89\n'3\u2014101.

(Acts 1901, ch. 122, \u00a7 1; 1907, ch. 3, \u00a7 1; Shan., \u00a7 128; Code 1932, \u00a7 146; Acts 1945, ch. 11, \u00a7 1; C.Supp.1950, \u00a7 146.)'\n\n\n151\nToday's apportionment statute is as enacted in 1901, with minor changes. For example:\n\n\n152\n(1) In 1957, Shelby County was raised from 7 1\/2 to 8 representatives. Acts of 1957, c. 220. See also Acts of 1959, c. 213. The 1957 Act, \u00a7 2, abolished the Twenty-seventh Joint Representative District, which had included Shelby and Fayette Counties.\n\n\n153\n(2) In 1907, Marion County was given a whole House seat instead of sharing a joint seat with Franklin County. Acts of 1907, c. 178. Acts of 1915, c. 145, repealed that change, restoring the status quo ante. And that reversal was itself reversed, Acts of 1919, c. 147.\n\n\n154\n(3) James County was in 1901 one of five counties in the Seventh State Senate District and one of the three in the Ninth House District. It appears that James County no longer exists but we are not advised when or how it was dissolved.\n\n\n155\n(4) In 1945, Anderson and Roane Counties were shifted to the Sixth State Senate District from the Seventh, and Monroe and Polk Counties were shifted to the Seventh from the Sixth. Acts of 1945, c. 11.\n\n\n156\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, concurring.\n\n\n157\nWhile I join the opinion of the Court and, like the Court, do not reach the merits, a word of explanation is necessary.1 I put to one side the problems of 'political' questions involving the distribution of power between this Court, the Congress, and the Chief Executive. We have here a phase of the recurring problem of the relation of the federal courts to state agencies. More particularly, the question is the extent to which a State may weight one person's vote more heavily than it does another's.\n\n\n158\nSo far as voting rights are concerned, there are large gaps in the Constitution. Yet the right to vote is inherent in the republican form of government envisaged by Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution. The House\u2014and now the Senate\u2014are chosen by the people. The time, manner, and place of elections of Senators and Representatives are left to the States (Article I, Section 4, Clause 1; Amendment XVII) subject to the regulatory power of Congress. A 'republican form' of government is guaranteed each State by Article IV, Section 4, and each is likewise promised protection against invasion.2 Ibid. That the States may specify the qualifications for voters is implicit in Article I, Section 2, Clause 1, which provides that the House of Representatives shall be chosen by the people and that 'the Electors (voters) in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors (voters) of the most numerous branch of the state legislature.' The same provision, contained in the Seventeenth Amendment, governs the election of Senators. Within limits those qualifications may be fixed by state law. See Lassiter v. Northampton Election Board, 360 U.S. 45, 50 51, 79 S.Ct. 985, 989, 3 L.Ed.2d 1072. Yet, as stated in Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651, 663\u2014664, 4 S.Ct. 152, 158, 28 L.Ed. 274, those who vote for members of Congress do not 'owe their right to vote to the state law, in any sense which makes the exercise of the right to depend exclusively on the law of the state.' The power of Congress to prescribe the qualifications for voters and thus override state law is not in issue here. It is, however, clear that by reason of the commands of the Constitution there are several qualifications that a State may not require.\n\n\n159\nRace, color, or previous condition of servitude is an impermissible standard by reason of the Fifteenth Amendment, and that alone is sufficient to explain Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110. See Taper, Gomillion versus Lightfoot (1962), pp. 12\u201417.\n\n\n160\nSex is another impermissible standard by reason of the Nineteenth Amendment.\n\n\n161\nThere is a third barrier to a State's freedom in prescribing qualifications of voters and that is the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the provision invoked here. And so the question is, may a State weight the vote of one county or one district more heavily than it weights the vote in another?\n\n\n162\nThe traditional test under the Equal Protection Clause has been whether a State has made 'an invidious discrimination,' as it does when it selects 'a particular race or nationality for oppressive treatment.' See Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 1113, 86 L.Ed. 1655. Universal equality is not the test; there is room for weighting. As we stated in Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 489, 75 S.Ct. 461, 465, 99 L.Ed. 563, 'The prohibition of the Equal Protection Clause goes no further than the invidious discrimination.'\n\n\n163\nI agree with my Brother CLARK that if the allegations in the complaint can be sustained a case for relief is established. We are told that a single vote in Moore County, Tennessee, is worth 19 votes in Hamilton County, that one vote in Stewart or in Chester County is worth nearly eight times a single vote in Shelby or Knox County. The opportunity to prove that an 'invidious discrimination' exists should therefore be given the appellants.\n\n\n164\nIt is said that any decision in cases of this kind is beyond the competence of courts. Some make the same point as regards the problem of equal protection in cases involving racial segregation. Yet the legality of claims and conduct is a traditional subject for judicial determination. Adjudication is often perplexing and complicated. An example of the extreme complexity of the task can be seen in a decree apportioning water among the several States. Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U.S. 589, 665, 65 S.Ct. 1332, 1373, 89 L.Ed. 1815. The constitutional guide is often vague, as the decisions under the Due Process and Commerce Clauses show. The problem under the Equal Protection Clause is no more intricate. See Lewis, Legislative Apportionment and the Federal Courts, 71 Harv.L.Rev. 1057, 1083\u20141084.\n\n\n165\nThere are, of course, some questions beyond judicial competence. Where the performance of a 'duty' is left to the discretion and good judgment of an executive officer, the judiciary will not compel the exercise of his discretion one way or the other (Commonwealth of Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 10 9, 16 L.Ed. 717), for to do so would be to take over the office. Cf. Federal Communications Comm. v. Broadcasting Co., 309 U.S. 134, 145, 60 S.Ct. 437, 442, 84 L.Ed. 656.\n\n\n166\nWhere the Constitution assigns a particular function wholly and indivisibly3 to another department, the federal judiciary does not intervene. Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., 246 U.S. 297, 302, 38 S.Ct. 309, 310, 62 L.Ed. 726. None of those cases is relevant here.\n\n\n167\nThere is no doubt that the federal courts have jurisdiction of controversies concerning voting rights. The Civil Rights Act gives them authority to redress the deprivation 'under color of any State law' of any 'right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States or by any Act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens * * *.' 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343(3). And 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(4), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343(4) gives the federal courts authority to award damages or issue an injunction to redress the violation of 'any Act of Congress providing for the protection of civil rights, including the right to vote.' (Italics added.) The element of state action covers a wide range. For as stated in United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 326, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 1043, 85 L.Ed. 1368:\n\n\n168\n'Misuse of power, possessed by virtue of state law and made      possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the      authority of state law, is action taken 'under color of'      state law.' And see Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct.      473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492.\n\n\n169\nThe right to vote in both federal and state elections was protected by the judiciary long before that right received the explicit protection it is now accorded by \u00a7 1343(4). Discrimination against a voter on account of race has been penalized (Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651, 4 S.Ct. 152, 28 L.Ed. 274) or struck down. Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U.S. 536, 47 S.Ct. 446, 71 L.Ed. 759; Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649, 64 S.Ct. 757, 88 L.Ed. 987; Terry v. Admas, 345 U.S. 461, 73 S.Ct. 809, 97 L.Ed. 1152. Fraudulent acts that dilute the votes of some have long been held to be within judicial cognizance. Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 25 L.Ed. 717. The 'right to have one's vote counted' whatever his race or nationality or creed was held in United States v. Mosley, 238 U.S. 383, 386, 35 S.Ct. 904, 905, 59 L.Ed. 1355, to be 'as open to protection by Congress as the right to put a ballot in a box.' See also United States v. Classic, supra, 313 U.S. at 324\u2014325, 61 S.Ct. at 1042; United States v. Saylor, 322 U.S. 385, 64 S.Ct. 1101, 88 L.Ed. 1341.\n\n\n170\nChief Justice Holt stated in Ashby v. White, 2 Ld.Raym. 938, 956 (a suit in which damages were awarded against election officials for not accepting the plaintiff's vote, 3 Ld.Raym. 320) that:\n\n\n171\n'To allow this action will make publick officers more careful      to observe the constitution of cities and boroughs, and not      to be so partial as they commonly are in all elections, which      is indeed a great and growing mischief, and tends to the      prejudice of the peace of the nation.'\n\n\n172\nThe same prophylactic effect will be produced here, as entrenched political regimes make other relief as illusory in this case as a petition to Parliament in Ashby v. White would have been.4\n\n\n173\nIntrusion of the Federal Government into the election machinery of the States has taken numerous forms\u2014investigations (Hannah v. Larche, 363 U.S. 420, 80 S.Ct. 1502, 4 L.Ed.2d 1307); criminal proceedings (Ex parte Siebold, supra; Ex parte Yarbrough, supra; United States v. Mosley, supra; United States v. Classic, supra); collection of penalties (Smith v. Allwright, supra); suits for declaratory relief and for an injunction (Terry v. Adams, supra); suits by the United States under the Civil Rights Act to enjoin discriminatory practices. United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524.\n\n\n174\nAs stated by Judge McLaughlin in Dyer v. Kazuhisa Abe, D.C., 138 F.Supp. 220, 236 (an apportionment case in Hawaii which was reversed and dismissed as moot, 9 Cir., 256 F.2d 728):\n\n\n175\n'The whole thrust of today's legal climate is to end      unconstitutional discrimination. It is ludicrous to preclude      judicial relief when a mainspring of representative      government is impaired. Legislators have no immunity from the      Constitution. The legislatures of our land should be made as      responsive to the Constitution of the United States as are      the citizens who elect the legislators.'\n\n\n176\nWith the exceptions of Colegrove v. Green, 328 U.S. 549, 66 S.Ct. 1198, 90 L.Ed. 1432; MacDougall v. Green, 335 U.S. 281, 69 S.Ct. 1, 93 L.Ed. 3; South v. Peters, 339 U.S. 276, 70 S.Ct. 641, 94 L.Ed. 834, and the decisions they spawned, the Court has never thought that protection of voting rights was beyond judicial cognizance. Today's treatment of those cases removes the only impediment to judicial cognizance of the claims stated in the present complaint.\n\n\n177\nThe justiciability of the present claims being established, any relief accorded can be fashioned in the light of wellknown principles of equity.5\n\n\n178\nMr. Justice CLARK, concurring.\n\n\n179\nOne emerging from the rash of opinions with their accompanying clashing of views may well find himself suffering a mental blindness. The Court holds that the appellants have alleged a cause of action. However, it refuses to award relief here although the facts are undisputed\u2014and fails to give the District Court any guidance whatever. One dissenting opinion, bursting with words that go through so much and conclude with so little, contemns the majority action as 'a massive repudiation of the experience of our whole past.' Another describes the complaint as merely asserting conclusory allegations that Tennessee's apportionment is 'incorrect,' 'arbitrary,' 'obsolete,' and 'unconstitutional.' I believe it can be shown that this case is distinguishable from earlier cases dealing with the distribution of political power by a State, that a patent violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution has been shown, and that an appropriate remedy may be formulated.\n\nI.\n\n180\nI take the law of the case from MacDougall v. Green, 335 U.S. 281, 69 S.Ct. 1, 93 L.Ed. 3 (1948), which involved an attack under the Equal Protection Clause upon an Illinois election statute. The Court decided that case on its merits without hindrance from the 'political question' doctrine. Although the statute under attack was upheld, it is clear that the Court based its decision upon the determination that the statute represented a rational state policy. It stated:\n\n\n181\n'It would be strange indeed, and doctrinaire, for this Court,      applying such broad constitutional concepts as due process      and equal protection of the laws, to deny a State the power      to assure a proper diffusion of political initiative as      between its thinly populated counties and those having      concentrated masses, in view of the fact that the latter have      practical opportunities for exerting their political weight      at the polls not available to the former.' Id., at 284, 69      S.Ct. at 2. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n182\nThe other cases upon which my Brethren dwell are all distinguishable or inapposite. The widely heralded case of Colegrove v. Green, 328 U.S. 549, 66 S.Ct. 1198, 90 L.Ed. 1432 (1946), was one not only in which the Court was bobtailed but in which there was no majority opinion. Indeed, even the 'political question' point in Mr. Justice PRANKFURTER'S opinion was no more than an alternative ground.1 Moreover, the appellants did not present an equal protection argument.2 While it has served as a Mother Hubbard to most of the subsequent cases, I feel it was in that respect ill cast and for all of these reasons put it to one side.3 Likewise, I do not consider the Guaranty Clause cases based on Art. I, \u00a7 4, of the Constitution, because it is not invoked here and it involves different criteria, as the Court's opinion indicates. Cases resting on various other considerations not present here, such as Radford v. Gary, 352 U.S. 991, 77 S.Ct. 559, 1 L.Ed.2d 540 (1957) (lack of equity); Kidd v. McCanless, 352 U.S. 920, 77 S.Ct. 223, 1 L.Ed.2d 157 (1956) (adequate state grounds supporting the state judgment); Anderson v. Jordan, 343 U.S. 912, 72 S.Ct. 648, 96 L.Ed. 1328 (1952) (adequate state grounds); Remmey v. Smith, 342 U.S. 916, 72 S.Ct. 368, 96 L.Ed. 685 (1952) (failure to exhaust state procedures), are of course not controlling. Finally, the Georgia county-unit-system cases, such as South v. Peters, 339 U.S. 276, 70 S.Ct. 641, 94 L.Ed. 834 (1950), reflect the viewpoint of MacDougall, i.e., to refrain from intervening where there is some rational policy behind the State's system.4\n\nII.\n\n183\nThe controlling facts cannot be disputed. It appears from the record that 37% of the voters of Tennessee elect 20 of the 33 Senators while 40% of the voters elect 6o of the 99 members of the House. But this might not on its face be an 'invidious discrimination,' Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, 348 U.S. 483, 489, 75 S.Ct. 461, 465, 99 L.Ed. 563 (1955), for a 'statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.' McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 426, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 1105, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961).\n\n\n184\nIt is true that the apportionment policy incorporated in Tennessee's Constitution, i.e., state-wide numerical equality of representation with certain minor qualifications,5 is a rational one. On a county-by-county comparison a districting plan based thereon naturally will have disparities in representation due to the qualifications. But this to my mind does not raise constitutional problems, for the overall policy is reasonable. However, the root of the trouble is not in Tennessee's Constitution, for admittedly its policy has not been followed. The discrimination lies in the action of Tennessee's Assembly in allocating legislative seats to counties or districts created by it. Try as one may, Tennessee's apportionment just cannot be made to fit the pattern cut by its Constitution. This was the finding of the District Court. The policy of the Constitution referred to by the dissenters, therefore, is of no relevance here. We must examine what the Assembly has done.6 The frequency and magnitude of the inequalities in the present districting admit of no policy whatever. An examination of Table I accompanying this opinion, 369 U.S., p. 262, 82 S.Ct., p. 734, conclusively reveals that the apportionment picture in Tennessee is a topsy-turvical of gigantic proportions. This is not to say that some of the disparity cannot be explained, but when the entire table is examined\u2014comparing the voting strength of counties of like population as well as contrasting that of the smaller with the larger counties\u2014it leaves but one conclusion, namely that Tennessee's apportionment is a crazy quilt without rational basis. At the risk of being accused of picking out a few of the horribles I shall allude to a series of examples that are taken from Table I.\n\n\n185\nAs is admitted, there is a wide disparity of voting strength between the large and small counties. Some samples are: Moore County has a total representation of two7 with a population (2,340) of only one-eleventh of Rutherford County (25,316) with the same representation; Decatur County (5,563) has the same representation as Carter (23,303) though the latter has four times the population; likewise, Loudon County (13,264), Houston (3,084), and Anderson County (33,990) have the same representation, i.e., 1.25 each. But it is said that in this illustration all of the underrepresented counties contain municipalities of over 10,000 population and they therefore should be included under the 'urban' classification, rationalizing this disparity as an attempt to effect a ruralurban political balance. But in so doing one is caught up in the backlash of his own bull whip, for many counties have municipalities with a population exceeding 10,000, yet the same invidious discrimination is present. For example:\n\n\n186\nCounty............... Population. Representation\n\nCarter................. 23,303. 1.10\nMaury.................. 24,556. 2.25\nWashington............. 36,967. 1.93\n\n187\nMadison................ 37,245. 3.50 Likewise, counties with no municipality of over 10,000 suffer a similar discrimination:\n\n\n188\nCounty............. Population. Representation\n\nGrundy...............  6,540. 0.95\nChester..............  6,391. 2.00\nCumberland...........  9,593. 0.63\nCrockett.............  9,676. 2.00\nLoudon............... 13,264. 1.25\nFayette.............. 13,577. 2.50\n\n189\nThis could not be an effort to attain political balance between rural and urban populations. Since discrimination is present among counties of like population, the plan is neither consistent nor rational. It discriminates horizontally creating gross disparities between rural areas themselves as well as between urban areas themselves,8 still maintaining the wide vertical disparity already pointed out between rural and urban.\n\n\n190\nIt is also insisted that the representation formula used above (see note 7) is 'patently deficient' because 'it eliminates from consideration the relative voting power of the counties that are joined together in a single election district.' This is a strange claim coming from those who rely on the proposition that 'the voice of every voter' need not have 'approximate equality.' Indeed, representative government, as they say, is not necessarily one of 'bare numbers.' The use of floterial districts in our political system is not ordinarily based on the theory that the floterial representative is splintered among the counties of his district per relative population. His function is to represent the whole district. However, I shall meet the charge on its own ground and by use of its 'adjusted 'total representation\" formula show that the present apportionment is loco. For example, compare some 'urban' areas of like population, using the HARLAN formula:\n\n\n191\nCounty              Population  Representation\n\nWashington........... 36,967. 2.65\nMadison.............. 37,245. 4.87\nCarter............... 23,303. 1.48\nGreene............... 23,649. 2.05\nMaury................ 24,556. 3.81\nCoffee............... 13,406. 2.32\nHamblen.............. 14,090. 1.07\n\n192\nAnd now, using the same formula, compare some so-called 'rural' areas of like population:\n\n\n193\nCounty              Population  Representation\n\nMoore................ 2,340. 1.23\nPickett.............. 2,565.  .22\nStewart.............. 5,238. 1.60\nCheatham............. 5,263.  .74\nChester.............. 6,391. 1.36\nGrundy............... 6,540.  .69\nSmith................ 8,731. 2.04\nUnicoi............... 8,787. 0.40\n\n194\nAnd for counties with similar representation but with gross differences in population, take:\n\n\n195\nCounty              Population  Representation\n\nSullivan............. 55,712. 4.07\nMaury................ 24,556. 3.81\nBlount............... 30,353. 2.12\nCoffee............... 13,406. 2.32\n\n196\nThese cannot be 'distorted effects,' for here the same formula proposed by the dissenters is used and the result is even 'a crazier' quilt.\n\n\n197\nThe truth is that\u2014although this case has been here for two years and has had over six hours' argument (three times the ordinary case) and has been most carefully considered over and over again by us in Conference and individually\u2014no one, not even the State nor the dissenters, has come up with any rational basis for Tennessee's apportionment statute.\n\n\n198\nNo one\u2014except the dissenters advocating the HARLAN 'adjusted 'total representation\" formula\u2014contends that mathematical equality among voters is required by the Equal Protection Clause. But certainly there must be some rational design to a State's districting. The discrimination here does not fit any pattern\u2014as I have said, it is but a crazy quilt. My Brother HARLAN contends that other proposed apportionment plans contain disparities. Instead of chasing those rabbits he should first pause long enough to meet appellants' proof of discrimination by showing that in fact the present plan follows a rational policy. Not being able to do this, he merely counters with such generalities as 'classic legislative judgment,' no 'significant discrepancy,' and 'de minimis departures.' I submit that even a casual glance at the present apportionment picture shows these conclusions to be entirely fanciful. If present representation has a policy at all, it is to maintain the status quo of invidious discrimination at any cost. Like the District Court, I conclude that appellants have met the burden of showing 'Tennessee is guilty of a clear violation of the state constitution and of the (federal) rights of the plaintiffs. * * *'\n\nIII.\n\n199\nAlthough I find the Tennessee apportionment statute offends the Equal Protection Clause, I would not consider intervention by this Court into so delicate a field if there were any other relief available to the people of Tennessee. But the majority of the people of Tennessee have no 'PRACTICAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXERTING THEir political weight at the polls' to correct the existing 'invidious discrimination.' Tennessee has no initiative and referendum. I have searched diligently for other 'practical opportunities' present under the law. I find none other than through the federal courts. The majority of the voters have been caught up in a legislative strait jacket. Tennessee has an 'informed, civically militant electorate' and 'an aroused popular conscience,' but it does not sear 'the conscience of the people's representatives.' This is because the legislative policy has riveted the present seats in the Assembly to their respective constituencies, and by the votes of their incumbents a reapportionment of any kind is prevented. The people have been rebuffed at the hands of the Assembly; they have tried the constitutional convention route, but since the call must originate in the Assembly it, too, has been fruitless. They have tried Tennessee courts with the same result,9 and Governors have fought the tide only to flounder. It is said that there is recourse in Congress and perhaps that may be, but from a practical standpoint this is without substance. To date Congress has never undertaken such a task in any State. We therefore must conclude that the people of Tennessee are stymied and without judicial intervention will be saddled with the present discrimination in the affairs of their state government\n\nIV.\n\n200\nFinally, we msut consider if there are any appropriate modes of effective judicial relief. The federal courts are of course not forums for political debate, nor should they resolve themselves into state constitutional conventions or legislative assemblies. Nor should their jurisdiction be exercised in the hope that such a declaration as is made today may have the direct effect of bringing on legislative action and relieving the courts of the problem of fashioning relief. To my mind this would be nothing less than blackjacking the Assembly into reapportioning the State. If judicial competence were lacking to fashion an effective decree, I would dismiss this appeal. However, like the Solicitor General of the United States, I see no such difficulty in the position of this case. One plan might be to start with the existing assembly districts, consolidate some of them, and award the seats thus released to those counties suffering the most egregious discrimination. Other possibilities are present and might be more effective. But the plan here suggested would at least release the stranglehold now on the Assembly and permit it to redistrict itself.\n\n\n201\nIn this regard the appellants have proposed a plan based on the rationale of state-wide equal representation. Not believing that numerical equality of representation throughout a State is constitutionally required, I would not apply such a standard albeit a permissive one. Nevertheless, the dissenters attack it by the application of the HARLAN 'adjusted 'total representation\" formula. The result is that some isolated inequalities are shown, but this in itself does not make the proposed plan irrational or place it in the 'crazy quilt' category. Such inequalities, as the dissenters point out in attempting to support the present apportionment as rational, are explainable. Moreover, there is no requirement that any plan have mathematical exactness in its application. Only where, as here, the total picture reveals incommensurables of both magnitude and frequency can it be said that there is present an invidious discrimination.\n\n\n202\nIn view of the detailed study that the Court has given this problem, it is unfortunate that a decision is not reached on the merits. The majority appears to hold, at least sub silentio, that an invidious discrimination is present, but it remands to the three-judge court for it to make what is certain to be that formal determination. It is true that Tennessee has not filed a formal answer. However, it has filed voluminous papers and made extended arguments supporting its position. At no time has it been able to contradict the appellants' factual claims; it has offered no rational explanation for the present apportionment; indeed, it has indicated that there are none known to it. As I have emphasized, the case proceeded to the point before the three-judge court that it was able to find an invidious discrimination factually present, and the State has not contested that holding here. In view of all this background I doubt if anything more can be offered or will be gained by the State on remand, other than time. Nevertheless, not being able to muster a court to dispose of the case on the merits, I concur in the opinion of the majority and acquiesce in the decision to remand. However, in fairness I do think that Tennessee is entitled to have my idea of what it faces on the record before us and the trial court some light as to how it might proceed.\n\n\n203\nAs John Rutledge (later Chief Justice) said 175 years ago in the course of the Constitutional Convention, a chief function of the Court is to secure the national rights.10 Its decision today supports the proposition for which our forebears fought and many died, namely, that to be fully conformable to the principle of right, the form of government must be representative.11 That is the keystone upon which our government was founded and lacking which no republic can survive. It is well for this Court to practice self-restraint and discipline in constitutional adjudication, but never in its history have those principles received sanction where the national rights of so many have been so clearly infringed for so long a time. National respect for the courts is more enhanced through the forthright enforcement of those rights rather than by rendering them nugatory through the interposition of subterfuges. In my view the ultimate decision today is in the greatest tradition of this Court.\n\nTABLE I\nPresent  Proposed total\nPresent total  total  representation\n\n204\nrepresentation  representation  (appellants'\n\n\n205\nusing  using J.  plan), using J.\n\n1950 voting  J.Clark's  Harlan's  Harlan's\n\n206\nCounty  population  formula  formula   formula\n\nVan Buren. 2,039.  .63   .23   .11\nMoore.. 2,340. 2.00  1.23   .18\nPickett. 2,565.  .70   .22   .24\nSequatchie. 2,904   .63   .33   .19\nMeigs.. 3,039.  .93   .48   .17\nHouston. 3,084. 1.25   .46   .24\nTrousdale. 3,351. 1.33   .43   .12\nLewis.. 3,413. 1.25   .39   .25\nPerry.. 3,711. 1.50   .71   .40\nBledsoe. 4,198.  .63   .49   .24\nClay... 4,528.  .70   .40   .42\nUnion.. 4,600.  .76   .37   .45\nHancock. 4,710.  .93   .62   .49\nStewart. 5,238. 1.75  1.60   .41\nCheatham. 5,263. 1.33   .72   .20\nCannon. 5,341. 2.00  1.43   .52\nDecatur. 5,563. 1.10   .79   .52\nLake... 6,252. 2.00  1.44   .41\nChester. 6,391. 2.00  1.36   .19\nGrundy. 6,540.  .95   .69   .43\nHumphreys. 6,588. 1.25  1.39   .72\nJohnson. 6,649. 1.10   .42   .43\nPresent  Proposed total\nPresent total  total  representation\n\n207\nrepresentation  representation  (appellants'\n\n\n208\nusing  using J.  plan), using J.\n\n1950 voting  J.Clark's  Harlan's  Harlan's\n\n209\nCounty  population  formula  formula   formula\n\nJackson. 6,719. 1.50  1.43   .63\nDe Kalb. 6,984. 2.00  1.56   .68\nBenton. 7,023. 1.10  1.01   .66\nFentress. 7,057.  .70   .62   .64\nGrainger. 7,125.  .93   .94   .65\nWayne.. 7,176. 1.25   .69   .76\nPolk... 7,330. 1.25   .68   .73\nHickman. 7,598. 2.00  1.85   .80\nMacon.. 7,974. 1.33  1.01   .61\nMorgan. 8,308.  .93   .59   .75\nScott.. 8,417.  .76   .68   .62\nSmith.. 8,731. 2.50  2.04   .67\nUnicoi. 8,787.  .93   .40   .63\nRhea... 8,937.  .93  1.42   .21\nWhite.. 9,244. 1.43  1.69   .90\nOverton. 9,474. 1.70  1.83   .89\nHardin. 9,577. 1.60  1.61   .93\nCumberland. 9,593   .63  1.10   .87\nCrockett. 9,676. 2.00  1.66   .63\nHenderson. 10,199  1.50   .78   .96\nMarion. 10,998. 1.75  1.73   .72\nMarshall. 11,288. 2.50  2.28   .84\nDickson. 11,294. 1.75  2.29   1.23\nJefferson. 11,359  1.10   .87   1.03\nMcNairy. 11,601. 1.60  1.74   1.13\nCocke. 12,572. 1.60  1.46   .89\nSevier. 12,793. 1.60  1.47   .69\nClaiborne. 12,799  1.43  1.61   1.34\nMonroe. 12,884. 1.75  1.68   1.30\nLoudon. 13,264. 1.25   .28   .52\nWarren. 13,337. 1.75  1.89   1.68\nCoffee. 13,406. 2.00  2.32   1.68\nHardeman. 13,565. 1.60  1.86   1.11\nFayette. 13,577. 2.50  2.48   1.11\nHaywood. 13,934. 2.50  2.52   1.69\nWilliamson. 14,064  2.33  2.96   1.71\nPresent  Proposed total\nPresent total  total  representation\n\n210\nrepresentation  representation  (appellants'\n\n\n211\nusing  using J.  plan), using J.\n\n1950 voting  J.Clark's  Harlan's  Harlan's\n\n212\nCounty  population  formula  formula   formula\n\nHamblen   14,090    1.10  1.07   1.67\nFranklin  14,297    1.75  1.95   1.73\nLauderdale  14,413  2.50  2.45   1.73\nBedford   14,732    2.00  1.45   1.74\nLincoln   15,092    2.50  2.72   1.77\nHenry     15,465    2.83  2.76   1.73\nLawrence  15,847    2.00  2.22   1.81\nGiles     15,935    2.25  2.54   1.81\nTipton    15,944    3.00  1.68   1.13\nRobertson  16,456   2.83  2.62   1.85\nWilson    16,459    3.00  3.03   1.21\nCarroll   16,472    2.83  2.88   1.82\nHawkins   16,900    3.00  1.93   1.82\nPutnam    17,071    1.70  2.50   1.86\nCampbell  17,477     .76  1.40   1.94\nRoane     17,639    1.75  1.26   1.30\nWeakley   18,007    2.33  2.63   1.85\nBradley   18,273    1.25  1.67   1.92\nMcMinn    18,347    1.75  1.97   1.92\nObion     18,434    2.00  2.30   1.94\nDyer      20,062    2.00  2.36   2.32\nSumner    20,143    2.33  3.56   2.54\nCarter    23,303    1.10  1.48   2.55\nGreene    23,649    1.93  2.05   2.68\nMaury     24,556    2.25  3.81   2.85\nRutherford  25,316  2.00  3.02   2.39\nMontgomery  26,284  3.00  3.73   3.06\nGibson    29,832    5.00  5.00   2.86\nBlount    30,353    1.60  2.12   2.19\nAnderson  33,990    1.25  1.30   3.62\nWashington  36,967  1.93  2.65   3.45\nMadison   37,245    3.50  4.87   3.69\nSullivan  55,712    3.00  4.07   5.57\nHamilton  131,971   6.00  6.00  15.09\nKnox     140,559    7.25  8.96  15.21\nDavidson  211,930  12.50  12.93  21.57\n\n213\nShelby   312,345   15.50  16.85  31.59   Mr. Justice STEWART, concurring.\n\n\n214\nThe separate writings of my dissenting and concurring Brothers stray so far from the subject of today's decision as to convey, I think, a distressingly inaccurate impression of what the Court decides. For that reason, I think it appropriate, in joining the opinion of the Court, to emphasize in a few words what the opinion does and does not say.\n\n\n215\nThe Court today decides three things and no more: '(a) that the court possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter; (b) that a justiciable cause of action is stated upon which appellants would be entitled to appropriate relief; and (c) * * * that the appellants have standing to challenge the Tennessee apportionment statutes.' 369 U.S., pp. 197\u2014198, 82 S.Ct., p. 699.\n\n\n216\nThe complaint in this case asserts that Tennessee's system of apportionment is utterly arbitrary\u2014without any possible justification in rationality. The District Court did not reach the merits of that claim, and this Court quite properly expresses no view on the subject. Contrary to the suggestion of my Brother HARLAN, the Court does not say or imply that 'state legislatures must be so structured as to reflect with approximate equality the voice of every voter.' 369 U.S., p. 332, 82 S.Ct., p. 772. The Court does not say or imply that there is anything in the Federal Constitution 'to prevent a State, acting not irrationally, from choosing any electoral legislative structure it thinks best suited to the interests, temper, and customs of its people.' 369 U.S., p. 334, 82 S.Ct., p. 773. And contrary to the suggestion of my Brother DOUGLAS, the Court most assuredly does not decide the question, 'may a State weight the vote of one county or one district more heavily than it weights the vote in another?' 369 U.S., p. 244, 82 S.Ct., p. 724.\n\n\n217\nIn MacDougall v. Green, 335 U.S. 281, 69 S.Ct. 1, 93 L.Ed. 3, the Court held that the Equal Protection Clause does not 'deny a State the power to assure a proper diffusion of political initiative as between its thinly populated counties and those having concentrated masses, in view of the fact that the latter have practical opportunities for exerting their political weight at the polls not available to the former.' 335 U.S. at 284, 69 S.Ct. at 2. In case after case arising under the Equal Protection Clause the Court has said what it said again only last Term\u2014that 'the Fourteenth Amendment permits the States a wide scope of discretion in enacting laws which affect some groups of citizens differently than others.' McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 425, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 1105, 6 L.Ed.2d 393. In case after case arising under that Clause we have also said that 'the burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute rests on him who assails it.' Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. Brownell, 294 U.S. 580, 584, 55 S.Ct. 538, 540, 79 L.Ed. 1070.\n\n\n218\nToday's decision does not turn its back on these settled precedents. I repeat, the Court today decides only: (1) that the District Court possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter; (2) that the complaint presents a justiciable controversy; (3) that the appellants have standing. My Brother CLARK has made a convincing prima facie showing that Tennessee's system of apportionment is in fact utterly arbitrary\u2014without any possible justification in rationality. My Brother HARLAN has, with imagination and ingenuity, hypothesized possibly rational bases for Tennessee's system. But the merits of this case are not before us now. The defendants have not yet had an opportunity to be heard in defense of the State's system of apportionment; indeed, they have not yet even filed an answer to the complaint. As in other cases, the proper place for the trial is in the trial court, not here.\n\n\n219\nMr. Justice FRANKFURTER, whom Mr. Justice HARLAN joins, dissenting.\n\n\n220\nThe Court today reverses a uniform course of decision established by a dozen cases, including one by which the very claim now sustained was unanimously rejected only five years ago. The impressive body of rulings thus cast aside reflected the equally uniform course of our political history regarding the relationship between population and legislative representation\u2014a wholly different matter from denial of the franchise to individuals because of race, color, religion or sex. Such a massive repudiation of the experience of our whole past in asserting destructively novel judicial power demands a detailed analysis of the role of this Court in our constitutional scheme. Disregard of inherent limits in the effective exercise of the Court's 'judicial Power' not only presages the futility of judicial intervention in the essentially political conflict of forces by which the relation between population and representation has time out of mind been and now is determined. It may well impair the Court's position as the ultimate organ of 'the supreme Law of the Land' in that vast range of legal problems, often strongly entangled in popular feeling, on which this Court must pronounce. The Court's authority\u2014possessed of neither the purse nor the sword\u2014ultimately rests on sustained public confidence in its moral sanction. Such feeling must be nourished by the Court's complete detachment, in fact and in appearance, from political entanglements and by abstention from injecting itself into the clash of political forces in political settlements.\n\n\n221\nA hypothetical claim resting on abstract assumptions is now for the first time made the basis for affording illusory relief for a particular evil even though it foreshadows deeper and more pervasive difficulties in consequence. The claim is hypothetical and the assumptions are abstract because the Court does not vouchsafe the lower courts\u2014state and federal\u2014guidelines for formulating specific, definite, wholly unprecedented remedies for the inevitable litigations that today's umbrageous disposition is bound to stimulate in connection with politically motivated reapportionments in so many States. In such a setting, to promulgate jurisdiction in the abstract is meaningless. It is as devoid of reality as 'a brooding omnipresence in the sky,' for it conveys no intimation what relief, if any, a District Court is capable of affording that would not invite legislatures to play ducks and drakes with the judiciary. For this Court to direct the District Court to enforce a claim to which the Court has over the years consistently found itself required to deny legal enforcement and at the same time to find it necessary to withhold any guidance to the lower court how to enforce this turnabout, new legal claim, manifests an odd indeed an esoteric\u2014conception of judicial propriety. One of the Court's supporting opinions, as elucidated by commentary, unwittingly affords a disheartening preview of the mathematical quagmire (apart from divers judicially inappropriate and elusive determinants) into which this Court today catapults the lower courts of the country without so much as adumbrating the basis for a legal calculus as a means of extrication. Even assuming the indispensable intellectual disinterestedness on the part of judges in such matters, they do not have accepted legal standards or criteria or even reliable analogies to draw upon for making judicial judgments. To charge courts with the task of accommodating the incommensurable factors of policy that underlie these mathematical puzzles is to attribute, however flatteringly, omnicompetence to judges. The Framers of the Constitution persistently rejected a proposal that embodied this assumption and Thomas Jefferson never entertained it.\n\n\n222\nRecent legislation, creating a district appropriately described as 'an atrocity of ingenuity,' is not unique. Considering the gross inequality among legislative electoral units within almost every State, the Court naturally shrinks from asserting that in districting at least substantial equality is a constitutional requirement enforceable by courts.* Room continues to be allowed for weighting. This of course implies that geography, economics, urbun-rural conflict, and all the other non-legal factors which have throughout our history entered into political districting are to some extent not to be ruled out in the undefined vista now opened up by review in the federal courts of state reapportionments. To some extent\u2014aye, there's the rub. In effect, today's decision empowers the courts of the country to devise what should constitute the proper composition of the legislatures of the fifty States. If state courts should for one reason or another find themselves unable to discharge this task, the duty of doing so is put on the federal courts or on this Court, if State views do not satisfy this Court's notion of what is proper districting.\n\n\n223\nWe were soothingly told at the bar of this Court that we need not worry about the kind of remedy a court could effectively fashion once the abstract constitutional right to have courts pass on a state-wide system of electoral districting is recognized as a matter of judicial rhetoric, because legislatures would heed the Court's admonition. This is not only a euphoric hope. It implies a sorry confession of judicial impotence in place of a frank acknowledgment that there is not under our Constitution a judicial remedy for every political mischief, for every undesirable exercise of legislative power. The Framers carefully and with deliberate forethought refused so to enthrone the judiciary. In this situation, as in others of like nature, appeal for relief does not belong here. Appeal must be to an informed, civically militant electorate. In a democratic society like ours, relief must come through an aroused popular conscience that sears the conscience of the people's representatives. In any event there is nothing judicially more unseemly nor more self-defeating than for this Court to make in terrorem pronouncements, to indulge in merely empty rhetoric, sounding a word of promise to the ear, sure to be disappointing to the hope. This is the latest in the series of cases in which the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment have been invoked in federal courts as restrictions upon the power of the States to allocate electoral weight among the voting populations of their various geographical subdivisions.1 The present action, which comes here on appeal from an order of a statutory three-judge District Court dismissing amended complaints seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, challenges the provisions of Tenn.Code Ann.1955, \u00a7\u00a7 3\u2014101 to 3\u2014109, which apportion state representative and senatorial seats among Tennessee's ninety-five counties.\n\n\n224\nThe original plaintiffs, citizens and qualified voters entitled to vote for members of the Tennessee Legislature in the several counties in which they respectively reside, bring this action in their own behalf and 'on behalf of all other voters in the State of Tennessee,' or, as they alternatively assert, 'on behalf of all qualified voters of their respective counties, and further, on behalf of all voters of the State of Tennessee who are similarly situated.' The cities of Knoxville and Chattanooga, and the Mayor of Nashville\u2014on his own behalf as a qualified voter and, pursuant to an authorizing resolution by the Nashville City Council, as a representative of all the city's residents\u2014were permitted to intervene as parties plaintiff.2 The defendants are executive officials charged with statutory duties in connection with state elections.3\n\n\n225\nThe original plaintiff's amended complaint avers, in substance, the following.4 The Constitution of the State of Tennessee declares that 'elections shall be free and equal,' provides that no qualifications other than age, citizenship and specified residence requirements shall be attached to the right of suffrage, and prohibits denying to any person the suffrage to which he is entitled except upon conviction of an infamous crime. Art. I, \u00a7 5; Art. IV, \u00a7 1. It requires an enumeration of qualified voters within every term of ten years after 1871 and an apportionment of representatives and senators among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified voters in each5 at the time of each decennial enumeration. Art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5, 6. Notwithstanding these provisions, the State Legislature has not reapportioned itself since 1901. The Reapportionment Act of that year, Tenn.Acts 1901, c. 122, now Tenn. Code Ann.1955, \u00a7\u00a7 3\u2014101 to 3\u2014109,6 was unconstitutional when enacted, because not preceded by the required enumeration of qualified voters and because it allocated legislative seats arbitrarily, unequally and discriminatorily, as measured by the 1900 federal census. Moreover, irrespective of the question of its validity in 1901, it is asserted that the Act became 'unconstitutional and obsolete' in 1911 by virtue of the decennial reapportionment requirement of the Tennessee Constitution. Continuing a 'purposeful and systematic plan to discriminate against a geographical class of persons,' recent Tennessee Legislatures have failed, as did their predecessors, to enact reapportionment legislation, although a number of bills providing for reapportionment have been introduced. Because of population shifts since 1901, the apportionment fixed by the Act of that year and still in effect is not proportionate to population, denies to the counties in which the plaintiffs live an additional number of representatives to which they are entitled, and renders plaintiffs' votes 'not as effective as the votes of the voters residing in other senatorial and representative districts * * *.' Plaintiffs 'suffer a debasement of their votes by virtue of the incorrect, arbitrary, obsolete and unconstitutional apportionment of the General Assembly * * *,' and the totality of the malapportionment's effect\u2014which permits a minority of about thirty-seven percent of the voting population of the State to control twenty of the thirty-three members of Tennessee's Senate, and a minority of forty percent of the voting population to control sixty-three of the ninety-nine members of the House\u2014results in 'a distortion of the constitutional system' established by the Federal and State Constitutions, prevents the General Assembly 'from being a body representative of the people of the State of Tennessee, * * *' and is 'contrary to the basic principle of representative government * * *,' and 'contrary to the philosophy of government in the United States and all anglo-Saxon jurisprudence * * *.'\n\n\n226\nExhibits appended to the complaint purport to demonstrate the extent of the inequalities of which plaintiffs complain. Based upon 'approximate voting population,'7 these set forth figures showing that the State Senator from Tennessee's most populous senatorial district represents five and two-tenths times the number of voters represented by the Senator from the least populous district, while the corresponding ratio for most and least populous House districts is more than eighteen to one. The General Assembly thus apportioned has discriminated against the underrepresented counties and in favor of the overrepresented counties in the collection and distribution of various taxes and tax revenues, notably in the distribution of school and highway-improvement founds,8 this discrimination being 'made possible and effective' by the Legislature's failure to reapportion itself. Plaintiffs conclude that election of the State Legislature pursuant to the apportionment fixed by the 1901 Act violates the Tennessee Constitution and deprives them of due process of law and of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Their prayer below was for a declaratory judgment striking down the Act, an injunction restraining defendants from any acts necessary to the holding of elections in the districts prescribed by Tenn.Code Ann. 1955, \u00a7\u00a7 3\u2014101 to 3\u2014109, until such time as the legislature is reapportioned 'according to the Constitution of the State of Tennessee,' and an order directing defendants to declare the next primary and general elections for members of the Tennessee Legislature on an atlarge basis\u2014the thirty-three senatorial candidates and the ninety-nine representative candidates receiving the highest number of votes to be declared elected.9\n\n\n227\nMotions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter and for failure to state a claim were made and granted, 179 F.Supp. 824, the District Court relying upon this Court's series of decisions beginning with Colegrove v. Green, 328 U.S. 549, 66 S.Ct. 1198, 90 L.Ed. 1432, rehearing denied, 329 U.S. 825, 67 S.Ct. 118, 91 L.Ed. 701, motion for reargument before the full bench denied, 329 U.S. 828, 67 S.Ct. 199, 91 L.Ed. 703. The original and intervening plaintiffs bring the case here on appeal. 364 U.S. 898, 81 S.Ct. 230, 5 L.Ed.2d 193. In this Court they have altered their request for relief, suggesting a 'step-by-step approach.' The first step is a remand to the District Court with directions to vacate the order dismissing the complaint and to enter an order retaining jurisdiction, providing 'the necessary spur to legislative action * * *.' If this proves insufficient, appellants will ask the 'additional spur' of an injunction prohibiting elections under the 1901 Act, or a declaration of the Act's unconstitutionality, or both. Finally, all other means failing, the District Court is invited by the plaintiffs, greatly daring, to order an election at large or redistrict the State itself or through a master. The Solicitor General of the United States, who has filed a brief amicus and argued in favor of reversal, asks the Court on this appeal to hold only that the District Court has 'jurisdiction' and may properly exercise it to entertain the plaintiffs' claims on the merits. This would leave to that court after remand the questions of the challenged statute's constitutionality and of some undefined, unadumbrated relief in the event a constitutional violation is found. After an argument at the last Term, the case was set down for reargument, 366 U.S. 907, 81 S.Ct. 1082 and heard this Term.\n\nI.\n\n228\nIn sustaining appellants' claim, based on the Fourteenth Amendment, that the District Court may entertain this suit, this Court's uniform course of decision over the years is overruled or disregarded. Explicitly it begins with colegrove v. Green, supra, decided in 1946, but its roots run deep in the Court's historic adjudicatory process.\n\n\n229\nColegrove held that a federal court should not entertain an action for declaratory and injunctive relief to adjudicate the constitutionality, under the Equal Protection Clause and other federal constitutional and statutory provisions, of a state statute establishing the respective districts for the State's election of Representatives to the Congress. Two opinions were written by the four Justices who composed the majority of the seven sitting members of the Court. Both opinions joining in the result in Colegrove v. Green agreed that considerations were controlling which dictated denial of jurisdiction though not in the strict sense of want of power. While the two opinions show a divergence of view regarding some of these considerations, there are important points of concurrence. Both opinions demonstrate a predominant concern, first, with avoiding federal judicial involvement in matters traditionally left to legislative policy making; second, with respect to the difficulty\u2014in view of the nature of the problems of apportionment and its history in this country\u2014of drawing on or devising judicial standards for judgment, as opposed to legislative determinations, of the part which mere numerical equality among voters should play as a criterion for the allocation of political power; and, third, with problems of finding appropriate modes of relief\u2014particularly, the problem of resolving the essentially political issue of the relative merits of atlarge elections and elections held in districts of unequal population.\n\n\n230\nThe broad applicability of these considerations\u2014summarized in the loose shorthand phrase, 'political question'\u2014in cases involving a State's apportionment of voting power among its numerous localities has led the Court, since 1946, to recognize their controlling effect in a variety of situations. (In all these cases decision was by a full Court.) The 'political question' principle as applied in Colegrove has found wide application commensurate with its function as 'one of the rules basic to the federal system and this Court's appropriate place within that structure.' Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, 331 U.S. 549, 570, 67 S.Ct. 1409, 1420, 91 L.Ed. 1666. In Colegrove v. Barrett, 330 U.S. 804, 67 S.Ct. 973, 91 L.Ed. 1262, litigants brought suit in a Federal District Court challenging as offensive to the Equal Protection Clause Illinois' state legislative-apportionment laws. They pointed to state constitutional provisions requiring decennial reapportionment and allocation of seats in proportion to population, alleged a failure to reapportion for more than forty-five years\u2014during which time extensive population shifts had rendered the legislative districts grossly unequal\u2014and sought declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to all elections to be held thereafter. After the complaint was dismissed by the District Court, this Court dismissed an appeal for want of a substantial federal question. A similar District Court decision was affirmed here in Radford v. Gary, 352 U.S. 991, 77 S.Ct. 559, 1 L.Ed.2d 540. And cf. Remmey v. Smith, 342 U.S. 916, 72 S.Ct. 368, 96 L.Ed. 685. In Tedesco v. Board of Supervisors, 339 U.S. 940, 70 S.Ct. 797, 94 L.Ed. 1357, the Court declined to hear, for want of a substantial federal question, the claim that the division of a municipality into voting districts of unequal population for the selection for councilmen fell afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment, and in Cox v. Peters, 342 U.S. 936, 72 S.Ct. 559, 96 L.Ed. 697, rehearing denied, 343 U.S. 921, 72 S.Ct. 675, 96 L.Ed. 1334, it found no substantial federal question raised by a state court's dismissal of a claim for damages for 'devaluation' of plaintiff's vote by application of Georgia's county-unit system in a primary election for the Democratic gubernatorial candidate. The same Georgia system was subsequently attacked in a complaint for declaratory judgment and an injunction; the federal district judge declined to take the requisite steps for the convening of a statutory three-judge court; and this Court, in Hartsfield v. Sloan, 357 U.S. 916, 78 S.Ct. 1363, 2 L.Ed.2d 1363, denied a motion for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the district judge to act. In MacDougall v. Green, 335 U.S. 281, 283, 69 S.Ct. 1, 93 L.Ed. 3, the Court noted that 'To assume that political power is a function exclusively of numbers is to disregard the practicalities of government,' and, citing the Colegrove cases, declined to find in 'such broad constitutional concepts as due process and equal protection of the laws,' id., at 284, 69 S.Ct. at 2, a warrant for federal judicial invalidation of an Illinois statute requiring as a condition for the formation of a new political party the securing of at least two hundred signatures from each of fifty counties. And in South v. Peters, 339 U.S. 276, 70 S.Ct. 641, 94 L.Ed. 834, another suit attacking Georgia's county-unit law, it affirmed a District Court dismissal, saying\n\n\n231\n'Federal courts consistently refuse to exercise their equity      powers in cases posing political issues arising from a      state's geographical distribution of electoral strength among      its political subdivisions.' Id., at 277, 70 S.Ct. at 642.\n\n\n232\nOf course it is important to recognize particular, relevant diversities among comprehensively similar situations. Appellants seek to distinguish several of this Court's prior decisions on one or another ground\u2014Colegrove v. Green on the ground that federal, not state, legislative apportionment was involved; Remmey v. Smith on the ground that state judicial remedies had not been tried; Radford v. Gary on the ground that Oklahoma has the initiative, whereas Tennessee does not. It would only darken counsel to discuss the relevance and significance of each of these assertedly distinguishing factors here and in the context of this entire line of cases. Suffice it that they do not serve to distinguish Colegrove v. Barrett, supra, which is on all fours with the present case, or to distinguish Kidd v. McCanless, 352 U.S. 920, 77 S.Ct. 223, 1 L.Ed.2d 157, in which the full Court without dissent, only five years ago, dismissed on authority of Colegrove v. Green and Anderson v. Jordan, 343 U.S. 912, 72 S.Ct. 648, 96 L.Ed. 1328, an appeal from the Supreme Court of Tennessee in which a precisely similar attack was made upon the very statute now challenged. If the weight and momentum of an unvarying course of carefully considered decisions are to be respected, appellants' claims are foreclosed not only by precedents governing the exact facts of the present case but are themselves supported by authority the more persuasive in that it gives effect to the Colegrove principle in distinctly varying circumstances in which state arrangements allocating relative degrees of political influence among geographic groups of voters were challenged under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nII.\n\n233\nThe colegrove doctrine, in the form in which repeated decisions have settled it, was not an innovation. It represents long judicial thought and experience. From its earliest opinions this Court has consistently recognized a class of controversies which do not lend themselves to judicial standards and judicial remedies. To classify the various instances as 'political questions' is rather a form of stating this conclusion than revealing of analysis.10 Some of the cases so labelled have no relevance here. But from others emerge unifying considerations that are compelling.\n\n\n234\n1. The cases concerning war or foreign affairs, for example, are usually explained by the necessity of the country's speaking with one voice in such matters. While this concern alone undoubtedly accounts for many of the decisions,11 others do not fit the pattern. It would hardly embarrass the conduct of war were this Court to determine, in connection with private transactions between litigants, the date upon which war is to be deemed terminated. But the Court has refused to do so. See, e.g., The Protector, 12 Wall. 700, 20 L.Ed. 463; Brown v. Hiatts, 15 Wall. 177, 21 L.Ed. 128; Adger v. Alston, 15 Wall. 555, 21 L.Ed. 234; Williams v. Bruffy, 96 U.S. 176, 192\u2014193, 24 L.Ed. 716. It does not suffice to explain such cases as Ludecke v. Watkins, 335 U.S. 160, 68 S.Ct. 1429, 92 L.Ed. 1881\u2014deferring to political determination the question of the duration of war for purposes of the Presidential power to deport alien enemies\u2014that judicial intruction would seriously impede the President's power effectively to protect the country's interests in time of war. Of course, this is true; but the precise issue presented is the duration of the time of war which demands the power. Cf. Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19, 6 L.Ed. 537; Lamar v. Browne, 92 U.S. 187, 193, 23 L.Ed. 650; Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., 251 U.S. 146, 40 S.Ct. 106, 64 L.Ed. 194; Kahn v. Anderson, 255 U.S. 1, 41 S.Ct. 224, 65 L.Ed. 469. And even for the purpose of determining the extent of congressional regulatory power over the tribes and dependent communities of Indians, it is ordinarily for Congress, not the Court, to determine whether or not a particular Indian group retains the characteristics constitutionally requisite to confer the power.12 E.g., United States v. Holliday, 3 Wall. 407, 18 L.Ed. 182; Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U.S. 286, 31 S.Ct. 578, 55 L.Ed. 738; United States v. Sandoval, 231 U.S. 28, 34 S.Ct. 1, 58 L.Ed. 107. A controlling factor in such cases is that, decision respecting these kinds of complex matters of policy being traditionally committed not to courts but to the political agencies of government for determination by criteria of political expendiency, there exists no standard ascertainable by settled judicial experience or process by reference to which a political decision affecting the question at issue between the parties can be judged. Where the question arises in the course of a litigation involving primarily the adjudication of other issues between the litigants, the Court accepts as a basis for adjudication the political departments' decision of it. But where its determination is the sole function to be served by the exercise of the judicial power, the Court will not entertain the action. See Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 68 S.Ct. 431, 92 L.Ed. 568. The dominant consideration is 'the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination * * *.' Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, for the Court, in Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433, 454\u2014455, 59 S.Ct. 972, 982, 83 L.Ed. 1385. Compare United States v. Rogers, 4 How. 567, 572, 11 L.Ed. 1105, with Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 8 L.Ed. 483.13\n\n\n235\nThis may be, like so many questions of law, a matter of degree. Questions have arisen under the Constitution to which adjudication gives answer although the criteria for decision are less than unwavering bright lines. Often in these cases illumination was found in the federal structures established by, or the underlying presuppositions of, the Constitution. With respect to such questions, the Court has recognized that, concerning a particular power of Congress put in issue, '* * * effective restraints on its exercise must proceed from political rather than from judicial processes.' Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 120, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87, 87 L.Ed. 122. It is also true that even regarding the duration of war and the status of Indian tribes, referred to above as subjects ordinarily committed exclusively to the nonjudicial branches, the Court has suggested that some limitations exist upon the range within which the decisions of those branches will be permitted to go unreviewed. See United States v. Sandoval, supra, 231 U.S. at 46, 34 S.Ct. at 5; cf. Chastleton Corp. v. Sinclair, 264 U.S. 543, 44 S.Ct. 405, 68 L.Ed. 841. But this is merely to acknowledge that particular circumstances may differ so greatly in degree as to differ thereby in kind, and that, although within a certain range of cases on a continuum, no standard of distinction can be found to tell between them, other cases will fall above or below the range. The doctrine of political questions, like any other, is not to be applied beyond the limits of its own logic, with all the quiddities and abstract disharmonies it may manifest. See the disposition of contentions based on logically distorting views of Colegrove v. Green and Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U.S. 161, 28 S.Ct. 40, 52 L.Ed. 151, in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110.\n\n\n236\n2. The Court has been particularly unwilling to interven in matters concerning the structure and organization of the political institutions of the States. The abstention from judicial entry into such areas has been greater even than that which marks the Court's ordinary approach to issues of state power challenged under broad federal guarantees. 'We should be very reluctant to decide that we had jurisdiction in such a case, and thus in an action of this nature to supervise and review the political administration of a state government by its own officials and through its own courts. The jurisdiction of this court would only exist in case there had been * * * such a plain and substantial departure from the fundamental principles upon which our government is based that it could with truth and propriety be said that, if the judgment were suffered to remain, the party aggrieved would be deprived of his life, liberty, or property in violation of the provisions of the federal constitution.' Wilson v. North Carolina, 169 U.S. 586, 596, 18 S.Ct. 435, 439, 42 L.Ed. 865. See Taylor and Marshall v. Beckham (No. 1), 178 U.S. 548, 20 S.Ct. 890, 44 L.Ed. 1187; Walton v. House of Representatives, 265 U.S. 487, 44 S.Ct. 628, 68 L.Ed. 1115; Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 64 S.Ct. 397, 88 L.Ed. 497. Cf. In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 220 221, 8 S.Ct. 482, 492\u2014493, 31 L.Ed. 402.\n\n\n237\nWhere, however, state law has made particular federal questions determinative of relations within the structure of state government, not in challenge of it, the Court has resolved such narrow, legally defined questions in proper proceedings. See Boyd v. Nebraska ex rel. Thayer, 143 U.S. 135, 12 S.Ct. 375, 36 L.Ed. 103. In such instances there is no conflict between state policy and the exercise of federal judicial power. This distinction explains the decisions in Smiley v. Holm, 285 U.S. 355, 52 S.Ct. 397, 76 L.Ed. 795; Koenig v. Flynn, 285 U.S. 375, 52 S.Ct. 403, 76 L.Ed. 805; and Carroll v. Becker, 285 U.S. 380, 52 S.Ct. 402, 76 L.Ed. 807, in which the Court released state constitutional provisions prescribing local lawmaking procedures from misconceived restriction of superior federal requirements. Adjudication of the federal claim involved in those cases was not one demanding the accommodation of conflicting interests for which no readily accessible judicial standards could be found. See McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U.S. 1, 13 S.Ct. 3, 36 L.Ed. 869, in which, in a case coming here on writ of error from the judgment of a state court which had entertained it on the merits, the Court treated as justiciable the claim that a State could not constitutionally select its presidential electors by districts, but held that Art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 2, of the Constitution left the mode of choosing electors in the absolute discretion of the States. Cf. Pope v. Williams, 193 U.S. 621, 24 S.Ct. 573, 48 L.Ed. 817; Breedlove v. Suttles, 302 U.S. 277, 58 S.Ct. 205, 82 L.Ed. 252. To read with literalness the abstracted jurisdictional discussion in the McPherson opinion reveals the danger of conceptions of 'justiciability' derived from talk and not from the effective decision in a case. In probing beneath the surface of cases in which the Court has declined to interfere with the actions of political organs of government, of decisive significance is whether in each situation the ultimate decision has been to intervene or not to intervene. Compare the reliance in South v. Peters, 339 U.S. 276, 70 S.Ct. 641, 94 L.Ed. 834, on MacDougall v. Green, 335 U.S. 281, 69 S.Ct. 1, 93 L.Ed. 3, and the 'jurisdictional' form of the opinion in Wilson v. North Carolina, 169 U.S. 586, 596, 18 S.Ct. 435, 439, 43 L.Ed. 865, supra.\n\n\n238\n3. The cases involving Negro disfranchisement are no exception to the principle of avoiding federal judicial intervention into matters of state government in the absence of an explicit and clear constitutional imperative. For here the controlling command of Supreme Law is plain and unequivocal. An end of discrimination against the Negro was the compelling motive of the Civil War Amendments. The Fifteenth expresses this in terms, and it is no less true of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth. Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 67\u201472, 21 L.Ed. 394; Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 306\u2014307, 25 L.Ed. 664; Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U.S. 536, 541, 47 S.Ct. 446, 447, 71 L.Ed. 759. Thus the Court, in cases involving discrimination against the Negro's right to vote, has recognized not only the action at law for damages,14 but, in appropriate circumstances, the extraordinary remedy of declaratory or injunctive relief.15 Schnell v. Davis, 336 U.S. 933, 69 S.Ct. 749, 93 L.Ed. 1093; Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461, 73 S.Ct. 809, 97 L.Ed. 1152.16 Injunctions in these cases, it should be noted, would not have restrained statewide general elections. Compare Giles v. Harris, 189 U.S. 475, 23 S.Ct. 639, 47 L.Ed. 909.\n\n\n239\n4. The Court has refused to exercise its jurisdiction to pass on 'abstract questions of political power, of sovereignty, of government.' Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 485, 43 S.Ct. 597, 600, 67 L.Ed. 1078. See Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 258 U.S. 158, 162, 42 S.Ct. 261, 262, 66 L.Ed. 531; New Jersey v. Sargent, 269 U.S. 328, 337, 46 S.Ct. 122, 124, 70 L.Ed. 289. The 'political question' doctrine, in this aspect, reflects the policies underlying the requirement of 'standing': that the litigant who would challenge official action must claim infringement of an interest particular and personal to himself, as distinguished from a cause of dissatisfaction with the general frame and functioning of government\u2014a complaint that the political institutions are awry. See Stearns v. Wood, 236 U.S. 75, 35 S.Ct. 229, 59 L.Ed. 475; Fairchild v. Hughes, 258 U.S. 126, 42 S.Ct. 274, 66 L.Ed. 499; United Public Workers of America (C.I.O.) v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 89\u201491, 67 S.Ct. 556, 564\u2014565, 91 L.Ed. 754. What renders cases of this kind non-justiciable is not necessarily the nature of the parties to them, for the Court has resolved other issues between similar parties;17 nor is it the nature of the legal question involved, for the same type of question has been adjudicated when presented in other forms of controversy.18 The crux of the matter is that courts are not fit instruments of decision where what is essentially at stake is the composition of those large contests of policy traditionally fought out in non-judicial forums, by which governments and the actions of governments are made and unmade. See Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 19 L.Ed. 227; White v. Hart, 13 Wall. 646, 20 L.Ed. 685; Phillips v. Payne, 92 U.S. 130, 23 L.Ed. 649; Marsh v. Burroughs, Fed.Cas.No. 9,112, 1 Woods 463, 471\u2014472 (Bradley, Circuit Justice); cf. Wilson v. Shaw, 204 U.S. 24, 27 S.Ct. 233, 51 L.Ed. 351; but see Coyle v. Smith, 221 U.S. 559, 31 S.Ct. 688, 55 L.Ed. 853. Thus, where the Cherokee Nation sought by an original motion to restrain the State of Georgia from the enforcement of laws which assimilated Cherokee territory to the State's counties, abrogated Cherokee law, and abolished Cherokee government, the Court held that such a claim was not judicially cognizable. Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 8 L.Ed. 25.19 And in Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, 18 L.Ed. 721, the Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction a bill by the State of Georgia seeking to enjoin enforcement of the Reconstruction Acts on the ground that the command by military districts which they established extinguished existing state government and replaced it with a form of government unauthorized by the Constitution:20\n\n\n240\n'That these matters, both as stated in the body of the bill,      and, in the prayers for relief, call for the judgment of the      court upon political questions, and, upon rights, not of      persons or property, but of a political character, will      hardly be denied. For the rights for the protection of which      our authority is invoked, are the rights of sovereignty, of      political jurisdiction, of government, of corporate existence      as a State, with all its constitutional powers and      privileges. No case of private rights or private property      infringed, or in danger of actual or threatened infringement,      is presented by the bill, in a judicial form, for the      judgment of the court.' Id., at 77.21\n\n\n241\n5. The influence of these converging considerations\u2014the caution not to undertake decision where standards meet for judicial judgment are lacking, the reluctance to interfere with matters of state government in the absence of an unquestionable and effectively enforceable mandate, the unwillingness to make courts arbiters of the broad issues of political organization historically committed to other institutions and for whose adjustment the judicial process is illadapted\u2014has been decisive of the settled line of cases, reaching back more than a century, which holds that Art. IV, \u00a7 4, of the Constitution, guaranteeing to the States 'a Republican Form of Government,'22 is not enforceable through the courts. E.g., O'Neill v. Leamer, 239 U.S. 244, 36 S.Ct. 54, 60 L.Ed. 249; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, 243 U.S. 219, 37 S.Ct. 260, 61 L.Ed. 685; Cochran v. Louisiana State Board of Education, 281 U.S. 370, 50 S.Ct. 335, 74 L.Ed. 913; Highland Farms Dairy, Inc. v. Agnew, 300 U.S. 608, 57 S.Ct. 549, 81 L.Ed. 835.23 Claims resting on this specific guarantee of the Constitution have been held non-justiciable which challenged state distribution of powers between the legislative and judicial branches, Ohio ex rel. Bryant v. Akron Metropolitan Park District, 281 U.S. 74, 50 S.Ct. 228, 74 L.Ed. 710, state delegation of power to municipalities, Kiernan v. Portland, Oregon, 223 U.S. 151, 32 S.Ct. 231, 56 L.Ed. 386, state adoption of the referendum as a legislative institution, Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U.S. 565, 569, 36 S.Ct. 708, 710, 60 L.Ed. 1172, and state restriction upon the power of state constitutional amendment, Marshall v. Dye, 231 U.S. 250, 256\u2014257, 34 S.Ct. 92, 93 94, 58 L.Ed. 206. The subject was fully considered in Pacific States Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Oregon, 223 U.S. 118, 32 S.Ct. 224, 56 L.Ed. 377, in which the Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction a writ of error attacking a state licensetax statute enacted by the initiative, on the claim that this mode of legislation was inconsistent with a Republican Form of Government and violated the Equal Protection Clause and other federal guarantees. After noting '* * * the ruinous destruction of legislative authority in matters purely political which would necessarily be occasioned by giving sanction to the doctrine which underlies and would be necessarily involved in sustaining the propositions contended for,'24 the Court said:\n\n\n242\n'* * * (The) essentially political nature (of this claim) is      at once made manifest by understanding that the assault which      the contention here advanced makes it (sic) not on the tax as      a tax, but on the State as a State. It is addressed to the      framework and political character of the government by which      the statute levying the tax was passed. It is the government,      the political entity, which (reducing the case to its      essence) is called to the bar of this court, not for the      purpose of testing judicially some exercise of power      assailed, on the ground that its exertion has injuriously affected the rights of an individual because      of repugnancy to some constitutional limitation, but to      demand of the State that it establish its right to exist as a      State, republican in form.' Id., at 150\u2014151, 32 S.Ct. at 231.\n\n\n243\nThe starting point of the doctrine applied in these cases is, of course, Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 12 L.Ed. 581. The case arose out of the Dorr Rebellion in Rhode Island in 1841\u20141842. Rhode Island, at the time of the separation from England, had not adopted a new constitution but had continued, in its existence as an independent State, under its original royal Charter, with certain statutory alterations. This frame of government provided no means for amendment of the fundamental law; the right of suffrage was to be prescribed by legislation, which limited it to freeholders. In the 1830's, largely because of the growth of towns in which there developed a propertied class whose means were not represented by freehold estates, dissatisfaction arose with the suffrage qualifications of the charter government. In addition, population shifts had caused a dated apportionment of seats in the lower house to yield substantial numerical inequality of political influence, even among qualified voters. The towns felt themselves underrepresented, and agitation began for electoral reform. When the charter government failed to respond, popular meetings of those who favored the broader suffrage were held and delegates elected to a convention which met and drafted a state constitution. This constitution provided for universal manhood suffrage (with certain qualifications); and it was to be adopted by vote of the people at elections at which a similarly expansive franchise obtained. This new scheme of government was ratified at the polls and declared effective by the convention, but the government elected and organized under it, with Dorr at its head, never came to power. The charter government denied the validity of the convention, the constitution and its government and, after an insignificant skirmish, routed Dorr and his followers. It meanwhile provided for the calling of its own convention, which drafted a constitution that went peacefully into effect in 1843.25\n\n\n244\nLuther v. Borden was a trespass action brought by one of Dorr's supporters in a United States Circuit Court to recover damages for the breaking and entering of his house. The defendants justified under military orders pursuant to martial law declared by the charter government, and plaintiff, by his reply, joined issue on the legality of the charter government subsequent to the adoption of the Dorr constitution. Evidence offered by the plaintiff tending to establish that the Dorr government was the rightful government of Rhode Island was rejected by the Circuit Court; the court charged the jury that the charter government was lawful; and on a verdict for defendants, plaintiff brought a writ of error to this Court.\n\n\n245\nThe Court, through Mr. Chief Justice Taney, affirmed. After noting that the issue of the charter government's legality had been resolved in that government's favor by the state courts of Rhode Island\u2014that the state courts, deeming the matter a political one unfit for judicial determination, had declined to entertain attacks upon the existence and authority of the charter government the Chief Justice held that the courts of the United States must follow those of the State in this regard. Id., at 39\u201440. It was recognized that the compulsion to follow state law would not apply in a federal court in the face of a superior command found in the Federal Constitution, ibid., but no such command was found. The Constitution, the Court said\u2014referring to the Guarantee Clause of the Fourth Article\u2014'* * * as far as it has provided for an emergency of this kind, and authorized the general government to interfere in the domestic concerns of a State, has treated the subject as political in its nature, and placed the power in the hands of that department.' Id., at 42.\n\n\n246\n'Under this article of the Constitution it rests with      Congress to decide what government is the established one in      a State. For as the United States guarantee to each State a      republican government, Congress must necessarily decide what      government is established in the State before it can      determine whether it is republican or not. And when the      senators and representatives of a State are admitted into the      councils of the Union, the authority of the government under      which they are appointed, as well as its republican      character, is recognized by the proper constitutional      authority. And its decision is binding on every other      department of the government, and could not be questioned in      a judicial tribunal. It is true that the contest in this case      did not last long enough to bring the matter to this issue;      and as no senators or representatives were elected under the      authority of the government of which Mr. Dorr was the head,      Congress was not called upon to decide the controversy. Yet      the right to decide is placed there, and not in the courts.'      Ibid.26\n\n\n247\nIn determining this issue non-justiciable, the Court was sensitive to the same considerations to which its later decisions have given the varied applications already discussed. It adverted to the delicacy of judicial intervention into the very structure of government.27 It acknowledged that tradition had long entrusted questions of this nature to non-judicial processes,28 and that judicial processes were unsuited to their decision.29 The absence of guiding standards for judgment was critical, for the question whether the Dorr constitution had been rightfully adopted depended, in part, upon the extent of the franchise to be recognized\u2014the very point of contention over which rebellion had been fought.\n\n\n248\n'* * * (I)f the Circuit Court had entered upon this inquiry,      by what rule could it have determined the qualification of      voters upon the adoption or rejection of the proposed      constitution, unless there was some previous law of the State      to guide it? It is the province of a court to expound the      law, not to make it. And certainly it is no part of the      judicial functions of any court of the United States to      prescribe the qualification of voters in a State, giving the      right to those to whom it is denied by the written and      established constitution and laws of the State, or taking it      away from those to whom it is given; nor has it the right to      determine what political privileges the citizens of a State are entitled to, unless there is an      established constitution or law to govern its decision.' Id.,      at 41.\n\n\n249\nMr. Justice Woodbury (who dissented with respect to the effect of martial law) agreed with the Court regarding the inappropriateness of judicial inquiry into the issues:\n\n\n250\n'But, fortunately for our freedom from political excitements      in judicial duties, this court can never with propriety be      called on officially to be the umpire in questions merely      political. The adjustment of these questions belongs to the      people and their political representatives, either in the      State or general government. These questions relate to      matters not to be settled on strict legal principles. They      are adjusted rather by inclination,\u2014or prejudice or      compromise, often. Some of them succeed or are defeated even      by public policy alone, or mere naked power, rather than      intrinsic right. * * *\n\n\n251\n'Another evil, alarming and little foreseen, involved in      regarding these as questions for the final arbitrament of      judges would be, that in such an event all political      privileges and rights would, in a dispute among the people,      depend on our decision finally. * * * (D)isputed points in      making constitutions, depending often, as before shown, on      policy, inclination, popular resolves, and popular will, * *      * if the people, in the distribution of powers under the      constitution, should ever think of making judges supreme      arbiters in political controversies, when not selected by      nor, frequently, amenable to them, nor at liberty to follow      such various considerations in their judgments as belong to      mere political questions, they will dethrone themselves and      lose one of their own invaluable birthrights; building up in      this way\u2014slowly, but surely\u2014a new sovereign power in the republic, in most respects irresponsible and unchangeable for      life, and one more dangerous, in theory at least, than the      worst elective oligarchy in the worst of times * * *.' Id.,      at 51\u201453.30\n\nIII.\n\n252\nThe present case involves all of the elements that have made the Guarantee Clause cases non-justiciable. It is, in effect, a Guarantee Clause claim masquerading under a different label. But it cannot make the case more fit for judicial action that appellants invoke the Fourteenth Amendment rather than Art. IV, \u00a7 4, where, in fact, the gist of their complaint is the same\u2014unless it can be found that the Fourteenth Amendment speaks with greater particularity to their situation. We have been admonished to avoid 'the tyranny of labels.' Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 114, 54 S.Ct. 330, 335, 78 L.Ed. 674. Art. IV, \u00a7 4, is not committed by express constitutional terms to Congress. It is the nature of the controversies arising under it, nothing else, which has made it judicially unenforceable. Of course, if a controversy falls within judicial power, it depends 'on how he (the plaintiff) casts his action,' Pan American Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court, 366 U.S. 656, 662, 81 S.Ct. 1303, 1307, 6 L.Ed.2d 584, whether he brings himself within a jurisdictional statute. But where judicial competence is wanting, it cannot be created by invoking one clause of the Constitution rather than another. When what was essentially a Guarantee Clause claim was sought to be laid, as well, under the Equal Protection Clause in Pacific States Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Oregon, supra, the Court had no difficulty in 'dispelling any mere confusion resulting from forms of expression, and considering the substance of things * * *.' 223 U.S., at 140, 32 S.Ct. at 227, 56 L.Ed. 377.\n\n\n253\nHere appellants attack 'the State as a State,' precisely as it was perceived to be attacked in the Pacific States case, id., at 150, 32 S.Ct. at 231. Their complaint is that the basis of representation of the Tennessee Legislature hurts them. They assert that 'a minority now rules in Tennessee,' that the apportionment statute results in a 'distortion of the constitutional system,' that the General Assembly is no longer 'a body representative of the people of the State of Tennessee,' all 'contrary to the basic principle of representative government * * *.' Accepting appellants' own formulation of the issue, one can know this handsaw from a hawk. Such a claim would be non-justiciable not merely under Art. IV, \u00a7 4, but under any clause of the Constitution, by virtue of the very fact that a federal court is not a forum for political debate. Massachusetts v. Mellon, supra.\n\n\n254\nBut appellants, of course, do not rest on this claim simpliciter. In invoking the Equal Protection Clause, they assert that the distortion of representative government complained of is produced by systematic discrimination against them, by way of 'a debasement of their votes * * *.' Does this characterization, with due regard for the facts from which it is derived, add anything to appellants' case?31\n\n\n255\nAt first blush, this charge of discrimination based on legislative underrepresentation is given the appearance of a more private, less impersonal claim, than the assertion that the frame of government is askew. Appellants appear as representatives of a class that is prejudiced as a class, in contradistinction to the polity in its entirety. However, the discrimination relied on is the deprivation of what appellants conceive to be their proportionate share of political influence. This, of course, is the practical effect of any allocation of power within the institutions of government. Hardly any distribution of political authority that could be assailed as rendering government nonrepublican would fail similarly to operate to the prejudice of some groups, and to the advantage of others, within the body politic. It would be ingenuous not to see, or consciously blind to deny, that the real battle over the initiative and referendum, or over a delegation of power to local rather than state-wide authority, is the battle between forces whose influence is disparate among the various organs of government to whom power may be given. No shift of power but works a corresponding shift in political influence among the groups composing a society.\n\n\n256\nWhat, then, is this question of legislative apportionment? Appellants invoke the right to vote and to have their votes counted.32 But they are permitted to vote and their votes are counted. They go to the polls, they cast their ballots, they send their representatives to the state councils. Their complaint is simply that the representatives are not sufficiently numerous or powerful\u2014in short, that Tennessee has adopted a basis of representation with which they are dissatisfied. Talk of 'debasement' or 'dilution' is circular talk. One cannot speak of 'debasement' or 'dilution' of the value of a vote until there is first defined a standard of reference as to what a vote should be worth. What is actually asked of the Court in this case is to choose among competing bases of representation ultimately, really, among competing theories of political philosophy\u2014in order to establish an appropriate frame of government for the State of Tennessee and thereby for all the States of the Union.\n\n\n257\nIn such a matter, abstract analogies which ignore the facts of history deal in unrealities; they betray reason. This is not a case in which a State has, through a device however oblique and sophisticated, denied Negroes or Jews or redheaded persons a vote, or given them only a third or a sixth of a vote. That was Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110. What Tennessee illustrates is an old and still widespread method of representation\u2014representation by local geographical division, only in part respective of population\u2014in preference to others, others, forsooth, more appealing. Appellants contest this choice and seek to make this Court the arbiter of the disagreement. They would make the Equal Protection Clause the charter of adjudication, asserting that the equality which it guarantees comports, if not the assurance of equal weight to every voter's vote, at least the basic conception that representation ought to be proportionate to population, a standard by reference to which the reasonableness of apportionment plans may be judged.\n\n\n258\nTo find such a political conception legally enforceable in the broad and unspecific guarantee of equal protection is to rewrite the Constitution. See Luther v. Borden, supra. Certainly, 'equal protection' is no more secure a foundation for judicial judgment of the permissibility of varying forms of representative government than is 'Republican Form.' Indeed since 'equal protection of the laws' can only mean an equality of persons standing in the same relation to whatever governmental action is challenged, the determination whether treatment is equal presupposes a determination concerning the nature of the relationship. This, with respect to apportionment, means an inquiry into the theoretic base of representation in an acceptably republican state. For a court could not determine the equal-protection issue without in fact first determining the Republican-Form issue, simply because what is reasonable for equal-protection purposes will depend upon what frame of government, basically, is allowed. To divorce 'equal protection' from 'Republican Form' is to talk about half a question.\n\n\n259\nThe notion that representation proportioned to the geographic spread of population is so universally accepted as a necessary element of equality between man and man that it must be taken to be the standard of a political equality preserved by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2014that it is, in appellants' words 'the basic principle of representative government'\u2014is, to put it bluntly, not true. However desirable and however desired by some among the great political thinkers and framers of our government, it has never been generally practiced, today or in the past. It was not the English system, it was not the colonial system, it was not the system chosen for the national government by the Constitution, it was not the system exclusively or even predominantly practiced by the States at the time of adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is not predominantly practiced by the States today. Unless judges, the judges of this Court, are to make their private views of political wisdom the measure of the Constitution\u2014views which in all honesty cannot but give the appearance, if not reflect the reality, of involvement with the business of partisan politics so inescapably a part of apportionment controversies\u2014the Fourteenth Amendment, 'itself a historical product,' Jackman v. Rosenbaum Co., 260 U.S. 22, 31, 43 S.Ct. 9, 10, 67 L.Ed. 107, provides no guide for judicial oversight of the representation problem.\n\n\n260\n1. Great Britain. Writing in 1958, Professor W. J. M. Mackenzie aptly summarized the British history of the principle of representation proportioned to population: \"Equal electoral districts' formed part of the programme of radical reform in England in the 1830s, the only part of that programme which has not been realised.'33 Until the late nineteenth century, the sole base of representation (with certain exceptions not now relevant) was the local geographical unit: each county or borough returned its fixed number of members, usually two for the English units, regardless of population.34 Prior to the Reform Act of 1832, this system was marked by the almost total disfranchisement of the populous northern industrial centers, which had grown to significant size at the advent of the Industrial Revolution and had not been granted borough representation, and by the existence of the rotten borough, playing its substantial part in the Crown's struggle for continued control of the Commons.35 In 1831, ten southernmost English counties, numbering three and a quarter million people, had two hundred and thirty-five parliamentary representatives, while the six northernmost counties, with more than three and a half million people, had sixty-eight.36 It was said that one hundred and eighty persons appointed three hundred and fifty members in the Commons.37 Less than a half century earlier, Madison in the Federalist had remarked that half the House was returned by less than six thousand of the eight million people of England and Scotland.38\n\n\n261\nThe Act of 1832, the product of a fierce partisan political struggle and the occasion of charges of gerrymandering not without foundation,39 effected eradication of only the most extreme numerical inequalities of the unreformed system. It did not adopt the principle of representation based on population, but merely disfranchised certain among the rotten borough and enfranchised most of the urban centers\u2014still quite without regard to their relative numbers.40 In the wake of the Act there remained substantial electoral inequality: the boroughs of Cornwall were represented sixteen times as weightily, judged by population, as the county's eastern division; the average ratio of seats to population in ten agricultural counties was four and a half times that in ten manufacturing divisions; Honiton, with about three thousand inhabitants, was equally represented with Liverpool, which had four hundred thousand.41 In 1866 apportionment by population began to be advocated generally in the House, but was not made the basis of the redistribution of 1867, although the act of that year did apportion representation more evenly, gauged by the population standard.42 Population shifts increased the surviving inequalities; by 1884 the representation ratio in many small boroughs was more than twenty-two times that of Birmingham or Manchester, forty-to-one disparities could be found elsewhere, and, in sum, in the 1870's and 1880's, a fourth of the electorate returned two-thirds of the members of the House.43\n\n\n262\nThe first systematic English attempt to distribute seats by population was the Redistribution Act of 1885.44 The statute still left ratios of inequality of as much as seven to one,45 which had increased to fifteen to one by 1912.46 In 1918 Parliament again responded to 'shockingly bad' conditions of inequality,47 and to partisan political inspiration,48 by redistribution.49 In 1944, redistribution was put on a periodic footing by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act of that year,50 which committed a continuing primary responsibility for reapportioning the Commons to administrative agencies (Boundary Commissions for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, respectively).51 The Commissions, having regard to certain rules prescribed for their guidance, are to prepare at designated intervals reports for the Home Secretary's submission to Parliament, along with the draft of an Order in Council to give effect to the Commissions' recommendations. The districting rules adopt the basic principle of representation by population, although the principle is significantly modified by directions to respect local geographic boundaries as far as practicable, and by discretion to take account of special geographical conditions, including the size, shape and accessibility of constituencies. Under the original 1944 Act, the rules provided that (subject to the exercise of the discretion respecting special geographical conditions and to regard for the total size of the House of Commons as prescribed by the Act) so far as practicable, the single-member districts should not deviate more than twenty-five percent from the electoral quota (population divided by number of constituencies). However, apparently at the recommendation of the Boundary Commission for England, the twenty-five percent standard was eliminated as too restrictive in 1947, and replaced by the flexible provision that constituencies are to be as near the electoral quota as practicable, a rule which is expressly subordinated both to the consideration of special geographic conditions and to that of preserving local boundaries.52 Free of the twenty-five percent rule, the Commissions drew up plans of distribution in which inequalities among the districts run, in ordinary cases, as high as two to one and, in the case of a few extraordinary constituencies, three to one.53 The action of the Boundary Commission for England was twice challenged in the courts in 1954\u2014the claim being that the Commission had violated statutory rules prescribing the standards for its judgment\u2014and in both cases the Judges declined to intervene. In Hammersmith Borough Council v. Boundary Commission for England,54 Harman, J., was of opinion that the nature of the controversy and the scheme of the Acts made the matter inappropriate for judicial interference, and in Harper v. Home Secretary,55 the Court of Appeal, per Evershed, M.R., quoting Harman, J., with approval, adverting to the wide range of discretion entrusted to the Commission under the Acts, and remarking the delicate character of the parliamentary issues in which it was sought to engage the court, reached the same conclusion.56\n\n\n263\nThe House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1958,57 made two further amendments to the law. Responsive to the recommendation of the Boundary Commission for England,58 the interval permitted between Commission reports was more than doubled, to a new maximum of fifteen years.59 And at the suggestion of the same Commission that 'It would ease the future labours of the Commission and remove much local irritation if Rule 5 (requiring that the electorate of each constituency be as near the electoral quota as practicable) were to be so amended as to allow us to make recommendations preserving the status quo in any area where such a course appeared to be desirable and not inconsistent with the broad intention of the Rules,'60 the Commissions were directed to consider the inconveniences attendant upon the alteration of constituencies, and the local ties which such alteration might break. The Home Secretary's view of this amendment was that it worked to erect 'a presumption against making changes unless there is a very strong case for them.'61\n\n\n264\n2. The Colonies and the Union. For the guiding political theorists of the Revolutionary generation, the English system of representation, in its most salient aspects of numerical inequality, was a model to be avoided, not followed.62 Nevertheless, the basic English principle of apportioning representatives among the local governmental entities, towns or counties, rather than among units of approximately equal population, had early taken root in the colonies.63 In some, as in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, numbers of electors were taken into account, in a rough fashion, by allotting increasing fixed quotas of representatives to several towns or classes of towns graduated by population, but in most of the colonies delegates were allowed to the local units without respect to numbers.64 This resulted in grossly unequal electoral units.65 The representation ratio in one North Carolina county was more than eight times that in another.66 Moreover, American rotten boroughs had appeared,67 and apportionment was made an instrument first in the political struggles between the King or the royal governors and the colonial legislatures,68 and, later, between the older tidewater regions in the colonies and the growing interior.69 Madison in the Philadelphia Convention adverted to the 'inequality of the Representation in the Legislatures of particular States, * * *'70 arguing that it was necessary to confer on Congress the power ultimately to regulate the times, places and manner of selecting Representatives,71 in order to forestall the overrepresented counties' securing themselves a similar overrepresentation in the national councils. The example of South Carolina, where Charleston's overrepresentation was a continuing bone of contention between the tidewater and the back country, was cited by Madison in the Virginia Convention and by King in the Massachusetts Convention, in support of the same power, and King also spoke of the extreme numerical inequality arising from Connecticut's town-representation system.72\n\n\n265\nSuch inequalities survived the constitutional period. The United States Constitution itself did not largely adopt the principle of numbers. Apportionment of the national legislature among the States was one of the most difficult problems for the Convention;73 its solution\u2014involving State representation in the Senate74 and the three-fifths compromise in the House75\u2014left neither chamber apportioned proportionately to population. Within the States, electoral power continued to be allotted to favor the tidewater.76 Jefferson, in his Notes on Virginia, recorded the 'very unequal' representation there: individual counties differing in population by a ratio of more than seventeen to one elected the same number of representatives, and those nineteen thousand of Virginia's fifty thousand men who lived between the falls of the rivers and the seacoast returned half the State's senators and almost half its delegates.77 In South Carolina in 1790, the three lower districts, with a white population of less than twenty-nine thousand elected twenty senators and seventy assembly members; while in the uplands more than one hundred and eleven thousand white persons elected seventeen senators and fifty-four assemblymen.78\n\n\n266\nIn the early nineteenth century, the demands of the interior became more insistent. The apportionment quarrel in Virginia was a major factor in precipitating the calling of a constitutional convention in 1829. Bitter animosities racked the convention, threatening the State with disunion. At last a compromise which gave the three hundred and twenty thousand people of the west thirteen senators, as against the nineteen senators returned by the three hundred sixty-three thousand people of the east, commanded agreement. It was adopted at the polls but left the western counties so dissatisfied that there were threats of revolt and realignment with the State of Maryland.79\n\n\n267\nMaryland, however, had her own numerical disproportions. In 1820, one representative vote in Calvert County was worth five in Frederick County, and almost two hundred thousand people were represented by eighteen members, while fifty thousand others elected twenty.80 This was the result of the county-representation system of allotment. And, except for Massachusetts which, after a long struggle, did adopt representation by population at the mid-century, a similar town-representation principle continued to prevail in various forms throughout New England, with all its attendant, often gross inequalities.81\n\n\n268\n3. The States at the time of ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and those later admitted. The several state conventions throughout the first half of the nineteenth century were the scenes of fierce sectional and party strifes respecting the geographic allocation of representation.82 Their product was a wide variety of apportionment methods which recognized the element of population in differing ways and degrees. Particularly pertinent to appraisal of the contention that the Fourteenth Amendment embodied a standard limiting the freedom of the States with regard to the principles and bases of local legislative apportionment is an examination of the apportionment provisions of the thirty-three States which ratified the Amendment between 1866 and 1870, at their respective times of ratification. These may be considered in two groups: (A) the ratifying States other than the ten Southern States whose constitutions, at the time of ratification or shortly thereafter, were the work of the Reconstruction Act conventions;83 and (B) the ten Reconstruction-Act States. All thirty-three are significant, because they demonstrate how unfounded is the assumption that the ratifying States could have agreed on a standard apportionment theory or practice, and how baseless the suggestion that by voting for the Equal Protection Clause they sought to establish a test mold for apportionment which\u2014if appellants' argument is sound\u2014struck down sub silentio not a few of their own state constitutional provisions. But the constitutions of the ten Reconstruction-Act States have an added importance, for it is scarcely to be thought that the Congress which was so solicitous for the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment as to make the readmission of the late rebel States to Congress turn on their respective ratifications of it, would have approved constitutions which\u2014again, under appellants' theory contemporaneously offended the Amendment.\n\n\n269\nA. Of the twenty-three ratifying States of the first group, seven or eight had constitutions which demanded or allowed apportionment of both houses on the basis of population,84 unqualifiedly or with only qualifications respecting the preservation of local boundaries.85 Three more apportioned on what was essentially a population base, but provided that in one house counties having a specified fraction of a ratio\u2014a moiety or two-thirds\u2014should have a representative.86 Since each of these three States limited the size of their chambers, the fractional rule could operate\u2014and, at least in Michigan, has in fact operated87\u2014to produce substantial numerical inequalities in favor of the sparsely populated counties.88 Iowa favored her small counties by the rule that no more than four counties might be combined in a representative district,89 and New York and Kansas compromised population and county-representation principles by assuring every county, regardless of the number of its inhabitants, at least one seat in their respective Houses.90\n\n\n270\nOhio and Maine recognized the factor of numbers by a different device. The former gave a House representative to each county having half a ratio, two representatives for a ratio and three-quarters, three representatives for three ratios, and a single additional representative for each additional ratio.91 The latter, after apportioning among counties on a population base, gave each town of fifteen hundred inhabitants one representative, each town of three thousand, seven hundred and fifty inhabitants two representatives, and so on in increasing intervals to twenty-six thousand, two hundred and fifty inhabitants\u2014towns of that size or larger receiving the maximum permitted number of representatives: seven.92 The departure from numerical equality under these systems is apparent: in Maine, assuming the incidence of towns in all categories, representative ratios would differ by factors of two and a half to one, at a minimum. Similarly, Missouri gave each of its counties, however small, one representative, two representatives for three ratios, three representatives for six ratios, and one additional representative for each three ratios above six.93 New Hampshire allotted a representative to each town of one hundred and fifty ratable male polls of voting age and one more representative for each increment of three hundred above that figure;94 its Senate was not apportioned by population but among districts based on the proportion of direct taxes paid.95 In Pennsylvania, the basis of apportionment in both houses was taxable inhabitants; and in the House every county of at least thirty-five hundred taxables had a representative, nor could more than three counties be joined in forming a representative district; while in the Senate no city or county could have more than four of the State's twenty-five to thirty-three senators.96\n\n\n271\nFinally, four States apportioned at least one House with no regard whatever to population. In Connecticut97 and Vermont98 representation in the House was on a town basis; Rhode Island gave one senator to each of its towns or cities,99 and New Jersey, one to each of its counties.100 Nor, in any of these States, was the other House apportioned on a strict principle of equal numbers: Connecticut gave each of its counties a minimum of two senators101 and Vermont, one;102 New Jersey assured each county a representative;103 and in Rhode Island, which gave at least one representative to each town or city, no town or city could have more than one-sixth of the total number in the House.104\n\n\n272\nB. Among the ten late Confederate States affected by the Reconstruction Acts, in only four did it appear that apportionment of both state legislative houses would or might be based strictly on population.105 In North Carolina,106 South Carolina,107 Louisiana,108 and Alabama,109 each county (in the case of Louisiana, each parish) was assured at least one seat in the lower House irrespective of numbers\u2014a distribution which exhausted, respectively, on the basis of the number of then-existing counties, three-quarters, one-quarter, two-fifths and three-fifths of the maximum possible number of representatives, before a single seat was available for assignment on a population basis; and in South Carolina, moreover, the Senate was composed of one member elected from each county, except that Charleston sent two.110 In Florida's House, each county had one seat guaranteed and an additional seat for every thousand registered voters up to a maximum of four representatives;111 while Georgia, whose Senate seats were distributed among forty-four single-member districts each composed of three contiguous counties,112 assigned representation in its House as follows: three seats to each of the six most populous counties, two to each of the thirty-one next most populous, one to each of the remaining ninety-five.113 As might be expected, the one-representative-per-county minimum pattern has proved incompatible with numerical equality,114 and Georgia's county-clustering system has produced representative-ratio disparities, between the largest and smallest counties, of more than sixty to one.115\n\n\n273\nC. The constitutions116 of the thirteen States which Congress admitted to the Union after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment showed a similar pattern. Six of them required or permitted apportionment of both Houses by population, subject only to qualifications concerning local boundaries.117 Wyoming, apportioning by population, guaranteed to each of its counties at least one seat in each House,118 and Idaho, which prescribed (after the first legislative session) that apportionment should be 'as may be provided by law,' gave each county at least one representative.119 In Oklahoma, House members were apportioned among counties so as to give one seat for half a ratio, two for a ratio and three-quarters, and one for each additional ratio up to a maximum of seven representatives per county.120 Montana required reapportionment of its House on the basis of periodic enumerations according to ratios to be fixed by law121 but its counties were represented as counties in the Senate, each county having one senator.122 Alaska123 and Hawaii124 each apportioned a number of senators among constitutionally fixed districts; their respective Houses were to be periodically reapportioned by population, subject to a moiety rule in Alaska125 and to Hawaii's guarantee of one representative to each of four constitutionally designated areas.126 The Arizona Constitution assigned representation to each county in each house, giving one or two senators and from one to seven representatives to each, and making no provision for reapportionment.127\n\n\n274\n4. Contemporary apportionment. Detailed recent studies are available to describe the present-day constitutional and statutory status of apportionment in the fifty States.128 They demonstrate a decided twentieth-century trend away from population as the exclusive base of representation. Today, only a dozen state constitutions provide for periodic legislative reapportionment of both houses by a substantially unqualified application of the population standard,129 and only about a dozen more prescribe such reapportionment for even a single chamber. 'Specific provision for county representation in at least one house of the state legislature has been increasingly adopted since the end of the 19th century. * * *'130 More than twenty States now guarantee each county at least one seat in one of their houses regardless of population, and in nine others county or town units are given equal representation in one legislative branch, whatever the number of each unit's inhabitants. Of course, numerically considered, 'These provisions invariably result in over-representation of the least populated areas. * * *'131 And in an effort to curb and political dominance of metropolitan regions, at least ten States now limit the maximum entitlement of any single county (or, in some cases, city) in one legislative house\u2014another source of substantial numerical disproportion.132\n\n\n275\nMoreover, it is common knowledge that the legislatures have not kept reapportionment up to date, even where state constitutions in terms require it.133 In particular, the pattern of according greater per capita representation to rural, relatively sparsely populated areas\u2014the same pattern which finds expression in various state constitutional provisions,134 and which has been given effect in England and elsewhere135\u2014has, in some of the States, been made the law by legislative inaction in the face of population shifts.136 Throughout the country, urban and suburban areas tend to be given higher representation ratios than do rural areas.137\n\n\n276\nThe stark fact is that if among the numerous widely varying principles and practices that control state legislative apportionment today there is any generally prevailing feature, that feature is geographic inequality in relation to the population standard.138 Examples could be endlessly multiplied. In New Jersey, counties of thirty-five thousand and of more than nine hundred and five thousand inhabitants respectively each have a single senator.139 Representative districts in Minnesota range from 7,290 inhabitants to 107,246 inhabitants.140 Rations of senatorial representation in California vary as much as two hundred and ninety-seven to one.141 In Oklahoma, the range is ten to one for House constituencies and roughly sixteen to one for Senate constituencies.142 Colebrook, Connecticut\u2014population 592\u2014elects two House representatives; Hartford\u2014population 177,397\u2014also elects two.143 The first, third and fifth of these examples are the products of constitutional provisions which subordinate population to regional considerations in apportionment; the second is the result of legislative inaction; the fourth derives from both constitutional and legislative sources. A survey made in 1955, in sum, reveals that less than thirty percent of the population inhabit districts sufficient to elect a House majority in thirteen States and a Senate majority in nineteen States.144 These figures show more than individual variations from a generally accepted standard of electoral equality. They show that there is not\u2014as there has never been\u2014a standard by which the place of equality as a factor in apportionment can be measured.\n\n\n277\nManifestly, the Equal Protection Clause supplies no clearer guide for judicial examination of apportionment methods than would the Guarantee Clause itself. Apportionment, by its character, is a subject of extraordinary complexity, involving\u2014even after the fundamental theoretical issues concerning what is to be represented in a representative legislature have been fought out or compromised\u2014considerations of geography, demography, electoral convenience, economic and social cohesions or divergencies among particular local groups, communications, the practical effects of political institutions like the lobby and the city machine, ancient traditions and ties of settled usage, respect for proven incumbents of long experience and senior status, mathematical mechanics, censuses compiling relevant data, and a host of others.145 Legislative responses throughout the country to the reapportionment demands of the 1960 Census have glaringly confirmed that these are not factors that lend themselves to evaluations of a nature that are the staple of judicial determinations or for which judges are equipped to adjudicate by legal training or experience or native wit. And this is the more so true because in every strand of this complicated, intricate web of values meet the contending forces of partisan politics.146 The practical significance of apportionment is that the next election results may differ because of it. Apportionment battles are overwhelmingly party or intra-party contests.147 It will add a virulent source of friction and tension in federal-state relations to embroil the federal judiciary in them.148\n\nIV.\n\n278\nAppellants, however, contend that the federal courts may provide the standard which the Fourteenth Amendment lacks by reference to the provisions of the constitution of Tennessee. The argument is that although the same or greater disparities of electoral strength may be suffered to exist immune from federal judicial review in States where they result from apportionment legislation consistent with state constitutions, the Tennessee Legislature may not abridge the rights which, on its face, its own constitution appears to give, without by that act denying equal protection of the laws. It is said that the law of Tennessee, as expressed by the words of its written constitution, has made the basic choice among policies in favor of representation proportioned to population, and that it is no longer open to the State to allot its voting power on other principles.\n\n\n279\nThis reasoning does not bear analysis. Like claims invoking state constitutional requirement have been rejected here and for good reason. It is settled that whatever federal consequences may derive from a discrimination worked by a state statute must be the same as if the same discrimination were written into the State's fundamental law. Nashville, C. & St. L.R. Co. v. Browning, 310 U.S. 362, 60 S.Ct. 968, 84 L.Ed. 1254. And see Castillo v. McConnico, 168 U.S. 674, 18 S.Ct. 229, 42 L.Ed. 622; Coulter v. Louisville & N.R. Co., 196 U.S. 599, 608\u2014609, 25 S.Ct. 342, 344 345, 49 L.Ed. 615; Owensboro Waterworks Co. v. Owensboro, 200 U.S. 38, 26 S.Ct. 249, 50 L.Ed. 361; Hebert v. Louisiana, 272 U.S. 312, 316\u2014317, 47 S.Ct. 103, 104, 71 L.Ed. 270; Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 11, 64 S.Ct. 397, 402, 88 L.Ed. 497. Appellants complain of a practice which, by their own allegations, has been the law of Tennessee for sixty years. They allege that the Apportionment Act of 1901 created unequal districts when passed and still maintains unequal districts. They allege that the Legislature has since 1901 purposefully retained unequal districts. And the Supreme Court of Tennessee has refused to invalidate the law establishing these unequal districts. Kidd v. McCanless, 200 Tenn. 273, 292 S.W.2d 40; appeal dismissed here in 352 U.S. 920, 77 S.Ct. 223, 1 L.Ed.2d 157. In these circumstances, what was said in the Browning case, supra, at 369, 60 S.Ct. at 972, clearly governs this case:\n\n\n280\n'* * * Here, according to petitioner's own claim, all the      organs of the state are conforming to a practice, systematic,      unbroken for more than forty years, and now questioned for      the first time. It would be a narrow conception of      jurisprudence to confine the notion of 'laws' to what is      found written on the statute books, and to disregard the      gloss which life has written upon it. Settled state practice      cannot supplant constitutional guarantees, but it can      establish what is state law. The equal protection clause did      not write an empty formalism into the Constitution. Deeply      embedded traditional ways of carrying out state policy, such      as those of which petitioner complains, are often tougher and      truer law than the dead words of the written text. * * * (T)      he equal protection clause is not a command of candor. * * *' Tennessee's law and its policy respecting apportionment are what 60 years of practice show them to be, not what appellants cull from the unenforced and, according to its own judiciary, unenforceable words of its Constitution. The statute comes here on the same footing, therefore, as would the apportionment laws of New Jersey, California or Connecticut,149 and is unaffected by its supposed repugnance to the state constitutional language on which appellants rely.150\n\n\n281\nIn another aspect, however, the Kidd v. McCanless case, supra, introduces a factor peculiar to this litigation, which only emphasizes the duty of declining the exercise of federal judicial jurisdiction. In all of the apportionment cases which have come before the Court, a consideration which has been weighty in determining their non-justiciability has been the difficulty or impossibility of devising effective judicial remedies in this class of case. An injunction restraining a general election unless the legislature reapportions would paralyze the critical centers of a State's political system and threaten political dislocation whose consequences are not foreseeable. A declaration devoid of implied compulsion of injunctive or other relief would be an idle threat.151 Surely a Federal District Court could not itself remap the State: the same complexities which impede effective judicial review of apportionment a fortiori make impossible a court's consideration of these imponderables as an original matter. And the choice of elections at large as opposed to elections by district, however unequal the districts, is a matter of sweeping political judgment having enormous political implications, the nature and reach of which are certainly beyond the informed understanding of, and capacity for appraisal by, courts.\n\n\n282\nIn Tennessee, moreover, the McCanless case has closed off several among even these unsatisfactory and dangerous modes of relief. That case was a suit in the state courts attacking the 1901 Reapportionment Act and seeking a declaration and an injunction of the Act's enforcement or, alternatively, a writ of mandamus compelling state election officials to hold the elections at large, or, again alternatively, a decree of the court reapportioning the State. The Chancellor denied all coercive relief, but entertained the suit for the purpose of rendering a declaratory judgment. It was his view that despite an invalidation of the statute under which the present legislature was elected, that body would continue to possess de facto authority to reapportion, and that therefore the maintaining of the suit did not threaten the disruption of the government. The Tennessee Supreme Court agreed that no coercive relief could be granted; in particular, it said, 'There is no provision of law for election of our General Assembly by an election at large over the State.' 200 Tenn., at 277, 292 S.W.2d, at 42. Thus, a legislature elected at large would not be the legally constituted legislative authority of the State. The court reversed, however, the Chancellor's determination to give declaratory relief, holding that the ground of demurrer which asserted that a striking down of the statute would disrupt the orderly process of government should have been sustained:\n\n\n283\n'(4) It seems obvious and we therefore hold that if the Act      of 1901 is to be declared unconstitutional, then the de facto      doctrine cannot be applied to maintain the present members of      the General Assembly in office. If the Chancellor is correct      in holding that this statute has expired by the passage of      the decade following its enactment then for the same reason      all prior apportionment acts have expired by a like lapse of      time and are nonexistent. Therefore we would not only not      have any existing members of the General Assembly but we      would have no apportionment act whatever under which a new      election could be held for the election of members to the      General Assembly.\n\n\n284\n'The ultimate result of holding this Act unconstitutional by      reason of the lapse of time would be to deprive us of the      present Legislature and the means of electing a new one and      ultimately bring about the destruction of the State itself.'      200 Tenn., at 281\u2014282, 292 S.W.2d, at 44.\n\n\n285\nA federal court enforcing the Federal Constitution is not, to be sure, bound by the remedial doctrines of the state courts. But it must consider as pertinent to the propriety or impropriety of exercising its jurisdiction those state-law effects of its decree which it cannot itself control. A federal court cannot provide the authority requisite to make a legislature the proper governing body of the State of Tennessee. And it cannot be doubted that the striking down of the statute here challenged on equal protection grounds, no less than on grounds of failure to reapportion decennially, would deprive the State of all valid apportionment legislation and\u2014under the ruling in McCanless\u2014deprive the State of an effective law-based legislative branch. Just such considerations, among others here present, were determinative in Luther v. Borden and the Oregon initiative cases.152\n\n\n286\nAlthough the District Court had jurisdiction in the very restricted sense of power to determine whether it could adjudicate the claim, the case is of that class of political controversy which, by the nature of its subject, is unfit for federal judicial action. The judgment of the District Court, in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted, should therefore be affirmed.\n\n\n287\nDissenting opinion of Mr. Justice HARLAN, whom Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER joins.\n\n\n288\nThe dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, in which I join, demonstrates the abrupt departure the majority makes from judicial history by putting the federal courts into this area of state concerns\u2014an area which, in this instance, the Tennessee state courts themselves have refused to enter.\n\n\n289\nIt does not detract from his opinion to say that the panorama of judicial history it unfolds, though evincing a steadfast underlying principle of keeping the federal courts out of these domains, has a tendency, because of variants in expression, to becloud analysis in a given case. With due respect to the majority, I think that has happened here.\n\n\n290\nOnce one cuts through the thicket of discussion devoted to 'jurisdiction,' 'standing,' 'justiciability,' and 'political question,' there emerges a straightforward issue which, in my view, is determinative of this case. Does the complaint disclose a violation of a federal constitutional right, in other words, a claim over which a United States District Court would have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343(3) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983? The majority opinion does not actually discuss this basic question, but, as one concurring Justice observes, seems to decide it 'sub silentio.' 369 U.S., p. 261, 82 S.Ct., p. 733. However, in my opinion, appellants' allegations, accepting all of them as true, do not, parsed down or as a whole, show an infringement by Tennessee of any rights assured by the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly, I believe the complaint should have been dismissed for 'failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.' Fed.Rules Civ.Proc., Rule 12(b)(6), 28 U.S.C.A.\n\n\n291\nIt is at once essential to recognize this case for what it is. The issue here relates not to a method of state electoral apportionment by which seats in the federal House of Representatives are allocated, but solely to the right of a State to fix the basis of representation in its own legislature. Until it is first decided to what extent that right is limited by the Federal Constitution, and whether what Tennessee has done or failed to do in this instance runs afoul of any such limitation, we need not reach the issues of 'justiciability' or 'political question' or any of the other considerations which in such cases as Colegrove v. Green, 328 U.S. 549, 66 S.Ct. 1198, 90 L.Ed. 1432, led the Court to decline to adjudicate a challenge to a state apportionment affecting seats in the federal House of Representatives, in the absence of a controlling Act of Congress. See also Wood v. Broom, 287 U.S. 1, 53 S.Ct. 1, 77 L.Ed. 131.\n\n\n292\nThe appellants' claim in this case ultimately rests entirely on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It is asserted that Tennessee has violated the Equal Protection Clause by maintaining in effect a system of apportionment that grossly favors in legislative representation the rural sections of the State as against its urban communities. Stripped to its essentials the complaint purports to set forth three constitutional claims of varying breadth:\n\n\n293\n(1) The Equal Protection Clause requires that each vote cast in state legislative elections be given approximately equal weight.\n\n\n294\n(2) Short of this, the existing apportionment of state legislators is so unreasonable as to amount to an arbitrary and capricious act of classification on the part of the Tennessee Legislature, which is offensive to the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n\n295\n(3) In any event, the existing apportionment is rendered invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment because it flies in the face of the Tennessee Constitution. For reasons given in Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER'S opinion, 369 U.S., pp. 325\u2014327, 82 S.Ct., pp. 768\u2014769, the last of these propositions is manifestly untenable, and need not be dealt with further. I turn to the other two.\n\nI.\n\n296\nI can find nothing in the Equal Protection Clause or elsewhere in the Federal Constitution which expressly or impliedly supports the view that state legislatures must be so structured as to reflect with approximate equality the voice of every voter. Not only is that proposition refuted by history, as shown by my Brother FRANKFURTER, but it strikes deep into the heart of our federal system. Its acceptance would require us to turn our backs on the regard which this Court has always shown for the judgment of state legislatures and courts on matters of basically local concern.\n\n\n297\nIn the last analysis, what lies at the core of this controversy is a difference of opinion as to the function of representative government. It is surely beyond argument that those who have the responsibility for devising a system of representation may permissibly consider that factors other than bare numbers should be taken into account. The existence of the United States Senate is proof enough of that. To consider that we may ignore the Tennessee Legislature's judgment in this instance because that body was the product of an asymmetrical electoral apportionment would in effect be to assume the very conclusion here disputed. Hence we must accept the present form of the Tennessee Legislature as the embodiment of the State's choice, or, more realistically, its compromise, between competing political philosophies. The federal courts have not been empowered by the Equal Protection Clause to judge whether this resolution of the State's internal political conflict is desirable or undesirable, wise or unwise.\n\n\n298\nWith respect to state tax statutes and regulatory measures, for example, it has been said that the 'day is gone when this Court uses the * * * Fourteenth Amendment to strike down state laws * * * because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought.' Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 488, 75 S.Ct. 461, 464, 99 L.Ed. 563. I would think it all the more compelling for us to follow this principle of self-restraint when what is involved is the freedom of a State to deal with so intimate a concern as the structure of its own legislative branch. The Federal Constitution imposes no limitation on the form which a state government may take other than generally committing to the United States the duty to guarantee to every State 'a Republican Form of Government.' And, as my Brother FRANKFURTER so conclusively proves (ante, 369 U.S., pp. 308\u2014317, 82 S.Ct., pp. 759\u2014764), no intention to fix immutably the means of selecting representatives for state governments could have been in the minds of either the founders or the draftsmen of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n299\nIn short, there is nothing in the Federal Constitution to prevent a State, acting not irrationally, from choosing any electoral legislative structure it thinks best suited to the interests, temper, and customs of its people. I would have thought this proposition settled by MacDougall v. Green, 335 U.S. 281, at p. 283, 69 S.Ct. 1, at p. 2, 93 L.Ed. 3, in which the Court observed that to 'assume that political power is a function exclusively of numbers is to disregard the practicalities of government,' and reaffirmed by South v. Peters, 339 U.S. 276, 70 S.Ct. 641, 94 L.Ed. 834. A State's choice to distribute electoral strength among geographical units, rather than according to a census of population, is certainly no less a rational decision of policy than would be its choice to levy a tax on property rather than a tax on income. Both are legislative judgments entitled to equal respect from this Court.\n\nII.\n\n300\nThe claim that Tennessee's system of apportionment is so unreasonable as to amount to a capricious classification of voting strength stands up no better under dispassionate analysis.\n\n\n301\nThe Court has said time and again that the Equal Protection Clause does not demand of state enactments either mathematical identity or rigid equality. E.g., Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc., v. Bowers, 358 U.S. 522, 527\u2014528, 79 S.Ct. 437, 440, 441, 3 L.Ed.2d 480, and authorities there cited; McGowan v. State of Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 425\u2014426, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 1104, 1105, 6 L.Ed.2d 393. All that is prohibited is 'invidious discrimination' bearing no rational relation to any permissible policy of the State. Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., supra, 348 U.S. at 489, 75 S.Ct. 461, 99 L.Ed. 563. And in deciding whether such discrimination has been practiced by a State, it must be borne in mind that a 'statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.' McGowan v. Maryland, supra. It is not inequality alone that calls for a holding of unconstitutionality; only if the inequality is based on an impermissible standard may this Court condemn it.\n\n\n302\nWhat then is the basis for the claim made in this case that the distribution of state senators and representatives is the product of capriciousness or of some constitutionally prohibited policy? It is not that Tennessee has arranged its electoral districts with a deliberate purpose to dilute the voting strength of one race, cf. Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110, or that some religious group is intentionally underrepresented. Nor is it a charge that the legislature has indulged in sheer caprice by allotting representatives to each county on the basis of a throw of the dice, or of some other determinant bearing no rational relation to the question of apportionment. Rather, the claim is that the State Legislature has unreasonably retained substantially the same allocation of senators and representatives as was established by statute in 1901, refusing to recognize the great shift in the population balance between urban and rural communities that has occurred in the meantime.\n\n\n303\nIt is further alleged that even as of 1901 the apportionment was invalid, in that it did not allocate state legislators among the counties in accordance with the formula set out in Art. II, \u00a7 5, of the Tennessee Constitution. In support of this the appellants have furnished a Table which indicates that as of 1901 six counties were overrepresented and 11 were underrepresented. But that Table in fact shows nothing in the way of significant discrepancy; in the instance of each county it is only one representative who is either lacking or added. And it is further perfectly evident that the variations are attributable to nothing more than the circumstance that the then enumeration of voters resulted in fractional remainders with respect to which the precise formula of the Tennessee Constitution was in some instances slightly disregarded. Unless such de minimis departures are to be deemed of significance, these statistics certainly provide no substantiation for the charge that the 1901 apportionment was arbitrary and capricious. Indeed, they show the contrary.\n\n\n304\nThus reduced to its essentials, the charge of arbitrariness and capriciousness rests entirely on the consistent refusal of the Tennessee Legislature over the past 60 years to alter a pattern of apportionment that was reasonable when conceived.\n\n\n305\nA Federal District Court is asked to say that the passage of time has rendered the 1901 apportionment obsolete to the point where its continuance becomes vulnerable under the Fourteenth Amendment. But is not this matter one that involves a classic legislative judgment? Surely it lies within the province of a state legislature to conclude that an existing allocation of senators and representatives constitutes a desirable balance of geographical and demographical representation, or that in the interest of stability of government it would be best to defer for some further time the redistribution of seats in the state legislature.\n\n\n306\nIndeed, I would hardly think it unconstitutional if a state legislature's expressed reason for establishing or maintaining an electoral imbalance between its rural and urban population were to protect the State's agricultural interests from the sheer weight of numbers of those residing in its cities. A State may, after all, take account of the interests of its rural population in the distribution of tax burdens, e.g., American Sugar Rfg. Co. v. State of Louisiana, 179 U.S. 89, 21 S.Ct. 43, 45 L.Ed. 102, and recognition of the special problems of agricultural interests has repeatedly been reflected in federal legislation, e.g., Capper-Volstead Act, 42 Stat. 388, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 291, 292; Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 31, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 601 et seq. Even the exemption of agricultural activities from state criminal statutes of otherwise general application has not been deemed offensive to the Equal Protection Clause. Tigner v. State of Texas, 310 U.S. 141, 60 S.Ct. 879, 84 L.Ed. 1124. Does the Fourteenth Amendment impose a stricter limitation upon a State's apportionment of political representatives to its central government? I think not. These are matters of local policy, on the wisdom of which the federal judiciary is neither permitted nor qualified to sit in judgment.\n\n\n307\nThe suggestion of my Brother FRANKFURTER that courts lack standards by which to decide such cases as this, is relevant not only to the question of 'justiciability,' but also, and perhaps more fundamentally, to the determination whether any cognizable constitutional claim has been asserted in this case. Courts are unable to decide when it is that an apportionment originally valid becomes void because the factors entering into such a decision are basically matters appropriate only for legislative judgment. And so long as there exists a possible rational legislative policy for retaining an existing apportionment, such a legislative decision cannot be said to breach the bulwark against arbitrariness and caprice that the Fourteenth Amendment affords. Certainly, with all due respect, the facile arithmetical argument contained in Part II of my Brother CLARK's separate opinion (369 U.S., pp. 253\u2014258, 82 S.Ct. pp. 729\u2014732) provides no tenable basis for considering that there has been such a breach in this instance. (See the Appendix to this opinion.)\n\n\n308\nThese conclusions can hardly be escaped by suggesting that capricious state action might be found were it to appear that a majority of the Tennessee legislators, in refusing to consider reapportionment, had been actuated by self-interest in perpetuating their own political offices or by other unworthy or improper motives. Since Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 3 L.Ed. 162, was decided many years ago, it has repeatedly been pointed out that it is not the business of the federal courts to inquire into the personal motives of legislators. E.g., State of Arizona v. State of California, 283 U.S. 423, 455 & n. 7, 51 S.Ct. 522, 526, 75 L.Ed. 1154. The function of the federal judiciary ends in matters of this kind once it appears, as I think it does here on the undisputed facts, that the state action complained of could have rested on some rational basis. (See the Appendix to this opinion.)\n\n\n309\nIt is my view that the majority opinion has failed to point to any recognizable constitutional claim alleged in this complaint. Indeed, it is interesting to note that my Brother STEWART is at pains to disclaim for himself, and to point out that the majority opinion does not suggest, that the Federal Constitution requires of the States any particular kind of electoral apportionment, still less that they must accord to each voter approximately equal voting strength. Concurring opinion, 369 U.S., p. 265, 82 S.Ct., pp. 736, 737. But that being so, what, may it be asked, is left of this complaint? Surely the bare allegations that the existing Tennessee apportionment is 'incorrect,' 'arbitrary,' 'obsolete' and 'unconstitutional' amounting to nothing more than legal conclusions\u2014do not themselves save the complaint from dismissal. See Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 64 S.Ct. 397, 88 L.Ed. 497; Collins v. Hardyman, 341 U.S. 651, 71 S.Ct. 937, 95 L.Ed. 1253. Nor do those allegations shift to the appellees the burden of proving the constitutionality of this state statute; as is so correctly emphasized by my Brother STEWART (369 U.S., p. 266, 82 S.Ct., p. 737), this Court has consistently held in cases arising under the Equal Protection Clause that \"the burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute rests on him who assails it.' Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. of New York v. Brownell, 294 U.S. 580, 584, 55 S.Ct. 538, 540, 79 L.Ed. 1070.' (Emphasis added.) Moreover, the appellants do not suggest that they could show at a trial anything beyond the matters previously discussed in this opinion, which add up to nothing in the way of a supportable constitutional challenge against this statute. And finally, the majority's failure to come to grips with the question whether the complaint states a claim cognizable under the Federal Constitution\u2014an issue necessarily presented by appellees' motion to dismiss\u2014 does not of course furnish any ground for permitting this action to go to trial.\n\n\n310\nFrom a reading of the majority and concurring opinions one will not find it difficult to catch the premises that underlie this decision. The fact that the appellants have been unable to obtain political redress of their asserted grievances appears to be regarded as a matter which should lead the Court to stretch to find some basis for judicial intervention. While the Equal Protection Clause is invoked, the opinion for the Court notably eschews explaining how, consonant with past decisions, the undisputed facts in this case can be considered to show a violation of that constitutional provision. The majority seems to have accepted the argument, pressed at the bar, that if this Court merely asserts authority in this field, Tennessee and other 'malapportioning' States will quickly respond with appropriate political action, so that this Court need not be greatly concerned about the federal courts becoming further involved in these matters. At the same time the majority has wholly failed to reckon with what the future may hold in store if this optimistic prediction is not fulfilled. Thus, what the Court is doing reflects more an adventure in judicial experimentation than a solid piece of constitutional adjudication. Whether dismissal of this case should have been for want of jurisdiction or, as is suggested in Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682\u2014683, 66 S.Ct. 773, 776, 777, 90 L.Ed. 939, for failure of the complaint to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, the judgment of the District Court was correct.\n\n\n311\nIn conclusion, it is appropriate to say that one need not agree, as a citizen, with what Tennessee has done or failed to do, in order to deprecate, as a judge, what the majority is doing today. Those observers of the Court who see it primarily as the last refuge for the correction of all inequality or injustice, no matter what its nature or source, will no doubt applaud this decision and its break with the past. Those who consider that continuing national respect for the Court's authority depends in large measure upon its wise exercise of self-restraint and discipline in constitutional adjudication, will view the decision with deep concern.\n\n\n312\nI would affirm.\n\n\n313\nAPPENDIX TO OPINION OF MR. JUSTICE HARLAN.\n\n\n314\nTHE INADEQUACY OF ARITHMETICAL FORMULAS AS MEASURES OF THE RATIONALITY OFTENNESSEE'S APPORTIONMENT.\n\n\n315\nTwo of the three separate concurring opinions appear to concede that the Equal Protection Clause does not guarantee to each state voter a vote of approximately equal weight for the State Legislature. Whether the existing Tennessee apportionment is constitutional is recognized to depend only on whether it can find 'any possible justification in rationality' (369 U.S., p. 265, 82 S.Ct., p. 736); it is to be struck down only if 'the discrimination here does not fit any pattern' (369 U.S., p. 258, 82 S.Ct., p. 732).\n\n\n316\nOne of the concurring opinions, that of my Brother STEWART, suggests no reasons which would justify a finding that the present distribution of state legislators is unconstitutionally arbitrary. The same is true of the majority opinion. My Brother CLARK, on the other hand, concludes that 'the apportionment picture in Tennessee is a topsy-turvical of gigantic proportions' (369 U.S., p. 254, 82 S.Ct., p. 730), solely on the basis of certain statistics presented in the text of his separate opinion and included in a more extensive Table appended thereto. In my view, that analysis is defective not only because the 'total representation' formula set out in footnote 7 of the opinion (369 U.S., p. 255, 82 S.Ct., pp. 730, 731), rests on faulty mathematical foundations, but, more basically, because the approach taken wholly ignores all other factors justifying a legislative determination of the sort involved in devising a proper apportionment for a State Legislature.\n\n\n317\nIn failing to take any of such other matters into account and in focusing on a particular mathematical formula which, as will be shown, is patently unsound, my Brother CLARK'S opinion has, I submit, unwittingly served to bring into basrelief the very reasons that support the view that this complaint does not state a claim on which relief could be granted. For in order to warrant holding a state electoral apportionment invalid under the Equal Protection Clause, a court, in line with well-established constitutional doctrine, must find that none of the permissible policies and none of the possible formulas on which it might have been based could rationally justify particular inequalities.\n\nI.\n\n318\nAt the outset, it cannot be denied that the apportionment rules explicitly set out in the Tennessee Constitution are rational. These rules are based on the following obviously permissible policy determinations: (1) to utilize counties as electoral units; (2) to prohibit the division of any county in the composition of electoral districts; (3) to allot to each county that has a substantial voting population\u2014at least two-thirds of the average voting population per county\u2014a separate 'direct representative'; (4) to create 'floterial' districts (multicounty representative districts) made up of more than one county; and (5) to require that such districts be composed of adjoining counties.1 Such a framework unavoidably leads to unreliable arithmetic inequalities under any mathematical formula whereby the counties' 'total representation' is sought to be measured. It particularly results in egregiously deceptive disparities if the formula proposed in my Brother CLARKS'S opinion is applied.\n\n\n319\nThat formula computes a county's 'total representation' by adding (1) the number of 'direct representatives' the county is entitled to elect; (2) a fraction of any other seats in the Tennessee House which are allocated to that county jointly with one or more others in a 'floterial district'; (3) triple the number of senators the county is entitled to elect alone; and (4) triple a fraction of any seats in the Tennessee Senate which are allocated to that county jointly with one or more others in a multicounty senatorial district. The fractions used for items (2) and (4) are computed by allotting to each county in a combined district an equal share of the House or Senate seat, regardless of the voting population of each of the counties that make up the election district.2\n\n\n320\nThis formula is patently deficient in that it eliminates from consideration the relative voting power of the counties that are joined together in a single election district. As a result, the formula unrealistically assigns to Moore County one-third of a senator, in addition to its direct representative (369 U.S., p. 255, 82 S.Ct., p. 730), although it must be obvious that Moore's voting strength in the Eighteenth Senatorial District is almost negligible. Since Moore County could cast only 2,340 votes of a total eligible vote of 30,478 in the senatorial district, it should in truth be considered as represented by one-fifteenth of a senator. Assuming, arguendo, that any 'total representation' figure is of significance, Moore's 'total representation' should be 1.23, not 2.3\n\n\n321\nThe formula suggested by my Brother CLARK must be adjusted regardless whether one thinks, as I assuredly do not, that the Federal Constitution requires that each vote be given equal weight. The correction is necessary simply to reflect the real facts of political life. It may, of course, be true that the floterial representative's 'function is to represent the whole district' (369 U.S., p. 256, 82 S.Ct., p. 731). But can it be gainsaid that so long as elections within the district are decided not by a county-unit system, in which each county casts one vote, but by adding the total number of individual votes cast for each candidate, the concern of the elected representatives will primarily be with the most populous counties in the district?\n\nII.\n\n322\nI do not mean to suggest that any mathematical formula, albeit an 'adjusted' one, would be a proper touchstone to measure the rationality of the present or of appellants' proposed apportionment plan. For, as the Table appended to my Brother CLARK'S opinion so conclusively shows, whether one applies the formula he suggests or one that is adjusted to reflect proportional voting strength within an election district, no plan of apportionment consistent with the principal policies of the Tennessee Constitution could provide proportionately equal 'total representation' for each of Tennessee's 95 counties.\n\n\n323\nThe pattern suggested by the appellants in Exhibits 'A' and 'B' attached to their complaint is said to be a 'fair distribution' which accords with the Tennessee Constitution, and under which each of the election districts represents approximately equal voting population. But even when tested by the 'adjusted' formula, the plan reveals gross 'total representation' disparities that would make it appear to be a 'crazy quilt.' For example, Loudon County, with twice the voting population of Humphreys County would have less representation than Humphreys, and about one-third the representation of Warren County, which has only 73 more voters. Among the more populous counties, similar discrepancies would appear. Although Anderson County has only somewhat over 10% more voters than Blount County, it would have approximately 75% more representation. And Blount would have approximately two-thirds the representation of Montgomery County, which has about 13% less voters.4\n\nIII.\n\n324\nThe fault with a purely statistical approach to the case at hand lies not with the particular mathematical formula used, but in the failure to take account of the fact that a multitude of legitimate legislative policies, along with circumstances of geography and demography, could account for the seeming electoral disparities among counties. The principles set out in the Tennessee Constitution are just some of those that were deemed significant. Others may have been considered and accepted by those entrusted with the responsibility for Tennessee's apportionment. And for the purposes of judging constitutionality under the Equal Protection Clause it must be remembered that what is controlling on the issue of 'rationality' is not what the State Legislature may actually have considered but what it may be deemed to have considered.\n\n\n325\nFor example, in the list of 'horribles' cited by my Brother CLARK (369 U.S., p. 255, 82 S.Ct., p. 730), all the 'underrepresented' counties are semiurban: all contain municipalities of over 10,000 population.5 This is not to say, however, that the presence of any such municipality within a county necessarily demands that its proportional representation be reduced in order to render it consistent with an 'urban versus rural' plan of apportionment. Other considerations may intervene and outweigh the Legislature's desire to distribute seats so as to achieve a proper balance between urban and rural interests. The size of a county, in terms of its total area, may be a factor.6 Or the location within a county of some major industry may be thought to call for dilution of voting strength.7 Again, the combination of certain smaller counties with their more heavily populated neighbors in senatorial or 'floterial' districts may result in apparent arithmetic inequalities.8\n\n\n326\nMore broadly, the disparities in electoral strength among the various counties in Tennessee, both those relied upon by my Brother CLARK and others, may be accounted for by various economic,9 political,10 and geographic11 considerations. No allegation is made by the appellants that the existing apportionment is the result of any other forces than are always at work in any legislative process; and the record, briefs, and arguments in this Court themselves attest to the fact that the appellants could put forward nothing further at a trial.\n\n\n327\nBy disregarding the wide variety of permissible legislative considerations that may enter into a state electoral apportionment by Brother CLARK has turned a highly complex process into an elementary arithmetical puzzle. It is only by blinking reality that such an analysis can stand and that the essentially legislative determination can be made the subject of judicial inquiry.\n\nIV.\n\n328\nApart from such policies as those suggested which would suffice to justify particular inequalities, there is a further consideration which could rationally have led the Tennessee Legislature, in the exercise of a deliberate choice, to maintain the status quo. Rigidity of an apportionment pattern may be as much a legislative policy decision as is a provision for periodic reapportionment. In the interest of stability, a State may write into its fundamental law a permanent distribution of legislators among its various election districts, thus forever ignoring shifts in population. Indeed, several States have achieved this result by providing for minimum and maximum representation from various political subdivisions such as counties, districts, cities, or towns. See Harvey, Reapportionments of State Legislatures\u2014Legal Requirements, 17 Law & Contemp. Probs. (1952), 364, 368\u2014372.\n\n\n329\nIt is said that one cannot find any rational standard in what the Tennessee Legislature has failed to do over the past 60 years. But surely one need not search far to find rationality in the Legislature's continued refusal to recognize the growth of the ruban population that has accompanied the development of industry over the past half decade. The existence of slight disparities between rural areas does not overcome the fact that the foremost apparent legislative motivation has been to preserve the electoral strength of the rural interests notwithstanding shifts in population. And I understand it to be conceded by at least some of the majority that this policy is not rendered unconstitutional merely because it favors rural voters.\n\n\n330\nOnce the electoral apportionment process is recognized for what it is\u2014the product of legislative give-and-take and of compromise among policies that often conflict\u2014the relevant constitutional principles at once put these appellants out of the federal courts.\n\n\n\n1\n Public Acts of Tennessee, c. 122 (1901), now Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 3\u2014101 to 3\u2014107. The full text of the 1901 Act as amended appears in an Appendix to this opinion, 369 U.S., p. 237, 82 S.Ct., p. 720.\n\n\n2\n The three-judge court was convened pursuant to the order of a single district judge, who, after he had reviewed certain decisions of this Court and found them distinguishable in features 'that may ultimately prove to be significant,' held that the complaint was not so obviously without merit that he would be justified in refusing to convene a three-judge court. 175 F.Supp. 649, 652.\n\n\n3\n We heard argument first at the 1960 Term and again at this Term when the case was set over for reargument. 366 U.S. 907, 81 S.Ct. 1082.\n\n\n4\n A county having less than, but at least two-thirds of, the population required to choose a Representative is allocated one Representative. See also Tenn.Const. Art. II, \u00a7 6. A common and much more substantial departure from the number-of-voters or total-population standard is the guaranty of at least one seat to each county. See, e.g., Kansas Const. Art. 2, \u00a7 2; N.J.Const. Art. 4, \u00a7 3, 1, N.J.S.A.\nWhile the Tennessee Constitution speaks of the number of 'qualified voters,' the exhibits attached to the complaint use figures based on the number of persons 21 years of age and over. This basis seems to have been employed by the General Assembly in apportioning legislative seats from the outset. The 1870 statute providing for the first enumeration, Acts of 1870 (1st Sess.), c. 107, directed the courts of\nthe several counties to select a Commissioner to enumerate 'all the male inhabitants of their respective counties, who are twenty-one years of age and upward, who shall be resident citizens of their counties on the first day of January, 1871. * * *.' Reports compiled in the several counties on this basis were submitted to the General Assembly by the Secretary of State and were used in the first apportionment. Appendix to Tenn.S.J., 1871, 41\u201443. Yet such figures would not reflect the numbers of persons qualified to exercise the franchise under the then-governing qualifications: (a) citizenship; (b) residence in the State 12 months, and in the county 6 months; (c) payment of poll taxes for the preceding year unless entitled to exemption. Acts of 1870 (2d Sess.), c. 10. (These qualifications continued at least until after 1901. See Shan.Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 1167, 1220 (1896; Supp. 1904).) Still, when the General Assembly directed the Secretary of State to do all he could to obtain complete reports from the counties, the Resolution spoke broadly of 'the impossibility of * * * (redistricting) without the census returns of the voting population from each county * * *.' Tenn.S.J., 1871, 46\u201447, 96. The figures also showed a correlation with Federal Census figures for 1870. The Census reported 259,016 male citizens 21 and upward in Tennessee. Ninth Census of the United States, 1870, Statistics of the Population 635 (1872). The Tennessee Secretary of State's Report, with 15 counties not reported, gave a figure of 237,431. Using the numbers of actual votes in the last gubernatorial election for those 15 counties, the Secretary arrived at a total of 250,025. Appendix to Tenn.S.J., 1871, 41\u201443. This and subsequent history indicate continued reference to Census figures and finally in 1901, abandonment of a state enumeration in favor of the use of Census figures. See notes 7, 8, 9, infra. See also Williams, Legislative Apportionment in Tennessee, 20 Tenn.L.Rev. 235, 236, n. 6. It would therefore appear that unless there is a contrary showing at the trial, appellants' current figures, taken from the United States Census Reports, are apposite.\n\n\n5\n Acts of 1871 (1st Sess.), c. 146.\n\n\n6\n Acts of 1870 (1st Sess.), c. 107.\n\n\n7\n The statute authorizing the enumeration was Acts of 1881 (1st Sess.), c. 124.

White. Examples of preliminary steps are: In 1911, the Senate called upon the Redistricting Committee to make an enumeration of qualified voters and to use the Federal Census of 1910 as the basis. Acts of 1911, S.J.Res. No. 60, p. 315. Similarly, in 1961, the Senate called for appointment of a select committee to make an enumeration of qualified voters. Acts of 1961, S.J.Res. No. 47, p. 1219. In 1955, the Senate called for a study of reapportionment. Tenn.S.J., 1955, 224; but see id., at 1403. Similarly, in 1961, the House directed the State Legislative Council to study methods of reapportionment. Acts of 1961, H.J.Res. No. 65, p. 1114.\n\n\n11\n Twelfth Census of the United States, 1900, Population (Part 1) 39 (1901); (Part 2) 202 (1902).\n\n\n12\n United States Census of Population: 1960, General Population Characteristics\u2014Tennessee, Table 16 (1961).\n\n\n13\n In the words of one of the intervening complaints, the apportionment was 'wholly arbitrary, * * * and, indeed, based upon no lawfully pertinent factor whatever.'\n\n\n14\n The appellants claim that no General Assembly constituted according to the 1901 Act will submit reapportionment proposals either to the people or to a Constitutional Convention. There is no provision for popular initiative in Tennessee. Amendments proposed in the Senate or House must first be approved by a majority of all members of each House and again by two-thirds of the members in the General Assembly next chosen. The proposals are then submitted to the people at the next general election in which a Governor is to be chosen. Alternatively, the legislature may submit to the people at any general election the question of calling a convention to consider specified proposals. Such as are adopted at a convention do not, however, become effective unless approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting separately on each proposed change or amendment at an election fixed by the convention. Conventions shall not be held oftener than once in six years. Tenn.Const. Art. XI, \u00a7 3. Acts of 1951, c. 130, \u00a7 3, and Acts of 1957, c. 340, \u00a7 3, provided that delegates to the 1953 and 1959 conventions were to be chosen from the counties and floterial districts just as are members of the State House of Representatives. The General Assembly's call for a 1953 Constitutional Convention originally contained a provision 'relating to the appointment (sic) of representatives and senators' but this was excised. Tenn.H.J., 1951, 784. A Resolution introduced at the 1959 Constitutional Convention and reported unfavorably by the Rules Committee of the Convention was as follows:\n'By Mr. Chambliss (of Hamilton County), Resolution No. 12 Relative to Convention considering reapportionment, which is as follows:\n'WHEREAS, there is a rumor that this Limited Convention has been called for the purpose of postponing for six years a Convention that would make a decision as to reapportionment; and\n'WHEREAS, there is pending in the United States Courts in Tennessee a suit under which parties are seeking, through decree, to compel reapportionment; and\n'WHEREAS, it is said that this Limited Convention, which was called for limited consideration, is yet a Constitutional Convention within the language of the Constitution as to Constitutional Conventions, forbidding frequent Conventions in the last sentence of Article Eleven, Section 3, second paragraph, more often than each six years, to-wit:\n\"No such Convention shall be held oftener than once in six years.'\n'Now, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That it is the consensus of opinion of the members of this Convention that since this is a Limited Convention as hereinbefore set forth another Convention could be had if it did not deal with the matters submitted to this Limited Convention.\n'BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That it is the consensus of opinion of this Convention that a Convention should be called by the General Assembly for the purpose of considering reapportionment in order that a possibility of Court enforcement being forced on the Sovereign State of Tennessee by the Courts of the National Government may be avoided.\n'BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That this Convention be adjourned for two years to meet again at the same time set forth in the statute providing for this Convention, and that it is the consensus of opinion of this body that it is within the power of the next General Assembly of Tennessee to broaden the powers of this Convention and to authorize and empower this Convention to consider a proper amendment to the Constitution that will provide, whe submitted to the electorate, a method of reapportionment.' Tenn.Constitutional Convention of 1959, The Journal and Debates, 35, 278.\n\n\n15\n It is clear that appellants' federal constitutional claims rest exclusively on alleged violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Their primary claim is that the 1901 statute violates the Equal Protection Clause of that amendment. There are allegations invoking the Due Process Clause but from the argument and the exhibits it appears that the Due Process Clause argument is directed at certain tax statutes. Insofar as the claim involves the validity of those statutes under the Due Process Clause we find it unnecessary to decide its merits. And if the allegations regarding the tax statutes are designed as the framework for proofs as to the effects of the allegedly discriminatory apportionment, we need not rely upon them to support our holding that the complaint states a federal constitutional claim of violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Whether, when the issue to be decided is one of the constitutional adequacy of this particular apportionment, taxation arguments and exhibits as now presented add anything, or whether they could add anything however presented, is for the District Court in the first instance to decide.\nThe complaint, in addition to the claims under the Federal Constitution, also alleges rights, and the General Assembly's duties, under the Tennessee Constitution. Since we hold that appellants have\u2014if it develops at trial that the facts support the allegations\u2014a cognizable federal constitutional cause of action resting in no degree on rights guaranteed or putatively guaranteed by the Tennessee Constitution, we do not consider, let alone enforce, rights under a State Constitution which go further than the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment. Lastly, we need not assess the legal significance, in reaching our conclusion, of the statements of the complaint that the apportionment effected today under the 1901 Act is 'contrary to the philosophy of government in the United States and all Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence * * *.'\n\n\n16\n We need not reach the question of indispensable parties because the District Court has not yet decided it.\n\n\n17\n The accuracy of calling even such dismissals 'jurisdictional' was questioned in Bell v. Hood. See 327 U.S. at 683, 66 S.Ct. at 776.\n\n\n18\n 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 provides: 'Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.'\n\n\n19\n This Court has frequently sustained District Court jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343(3) or its predecessors to entertain suits to redress deprivations of rights secured against state infringement by the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Douglas v. Jeannette, 319 U.S. 157, 63 S.Ct. 877, 87 L.Ed. 1324; Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U.S. 117, 72 S.Ct. 118, 96 L.Ed. 138; cf. Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U.S. 536, 47 S.Ct. 446, 71 L.Ed. 759; Nixon v. Condon, 286 U.S. 73, 52 S.Ct. 484, 76 L.Ed. 984; Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 64 S.Ct. 397, 88 L.Ed. 497; Smith v.

Aurora, 365 U.S. 514, 81 S.Ct. 684, 5 L.Ed.2d 741.\n\n\n20\n Since that case was not brought to the Court until after the election had been held, the Court cited not only Wood v. Broom, but also directed dismissal for mootness, citing Brownlow v. Schwartz, 261 U.S. 216, 43 S.Ct. 263, 67 L.Ed. 620.\n\n\n21\n Compare Boeing Aircraft Co. v. King County, 330 U.S. 803, 67 S.Ct. 972, 91 L.Ed. 1262 ('the appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction'). See Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433, 440, 59 S.Ct. 972, 83 L.Ed. 1385.\n\n\n22\n Matthews did affirm a judgment that may be read as a dismissal for want of jurisdiction, 179 F.Supp. 470. However, the motion to affirm also rested on the ground of failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Cf. text following, on MacDougall v. Green. And see text, infra, 369 U.S., p. 236, 82 S.Ct., p. 720.\n\n\n23\n The Mayor of Nashville suing 'on behalf of himself and all residents of the City of Nashville, Davidson County, . . .' and the Cities of Chattanooga (Hamilton County) and Knoxville (Knox County), each suing on behalf of its residents, were permitted to intervene as parties plaintiff. Since they press the same claims as do the initial plaintiffs, we find it unnecessary to decide whether the intervenors would have standing to maintain this action in their asserted representative capacities.\n\n\n24\n The complaint also contains an averment that the appellants sue 'on their own behalf and on behalf of all other voters in the State of Tennessee.' (Emphasis added.) This may be read to assert a claim that voters in counties allegedly over-represented in the General Assembly also have standing to complain. But it is not necessary to decide that question in this case.\n\n\n25\n The duties of the respective appellees are alleged to be as follows:\n'Defendant, Joe C. Carr, is the duly elected, qualified and acting Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee, with his office in Nashville in said State, and as such he is charged with the duty of furnishing blanks, envelopes and information slips to the County Election Commissioners, certifying the results of elections and maintaining the records thereof; and he is further ex officio charged, together with the Governor and the Attorney General, with the duty of examining the election returns received from the County Election Commissioners and declaring the election results, by the applicable provisions of the Tennessee Code Annotated, and by Chapter 164 of the Acts of 1949, inter alia.\n'Defendant, George F. McCanless, is the duly appointed and acting Attorney General of the State of Tennessee, with his office in Nashville in said State, and is charged with the duty of advising the officers of the State upon the law, and is made by Section 23\u20141107 of the Tennessee Code Annotated a necessary party defendant in any declaratory judgment action where the constitutionality of statutes of the State of Tennessee is attacked, and he is ex-officio charged, together with the Governor and the Secretary of State, with the duty of declaring the election results, under Section 2\u2014140 of the Tennessee Code Annotated.\n'Defendant, Jerry McDonald, is the duly appointed Coordinator of Elections in the State of Tennessee, with his office in Nashville, Tennessee, and as such official, is charged with the duties set forth in the public law enacted by the 1959 General Assembly of Tennessee creating said office (chapter 148).\n'Defendants, Dr. Sam Coward, James Alexander, and Hubert Brooks are the duly appointed and qualified members constituting the State Board of Elections, and as such they are charged with the duty of appointing the Flection Commissioners for all the counties of the State of Tennessee, the organization and supervision of the biennial elections as provided by the Statutes of Tennessee, Chapter 9 of Title 2 of the Tennessee Code Annotated, Sections 2\u2014901, et seq.\n'That this action is brought against the aforenamed defendants in their representative capacities, and that said Election Commissioners are sued also as representatives of all of the County Election Commissioners in the State of Tennessee, such persons being so numerous as to make it impracticable to bring them all before the court; that there is a common question of law involved, namely, the constitutionality of Tennessee laws set forth in the Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 3\u2014101 through Section 3\u2014109, inclusive; that common relief is sought against all members of said Election Commissions in their official capacities, it being the duties of the aforesaid County Election Commissioners, within their respective jurisdictions, to appoint the judges of elections, to maintain the registry of qualified voters of said County, certify the results of elections held in said County to the defendants State Board of Elections and Secretary of State, and of preparing ballots and taking other steps to prepare for and hold elections in said Counties by virtue of Sections 2\u20141201, et seq. of Tennessee Code Annotated, and Section 2\u2014301, et seq. of Tennessee Code Annotated, and Chapter 164 of the Acts of 1949, inter alia.'\nThe question whether the named defendants are sufficient parties remains open for consideration on remand.\n\n\n26\n Smiley v. Holm, supra, 285 U.S., at 361, 52 S.Ct., at 397 (\"citizen, elector and taxpayer' of the state'); Koenig v. Flynn, supra, 285 U.S., at 379, 52 S.Ct., at 403 (\"citizens and voters' of the state'); Wood v. Broom, supra, 287 U.S., at 4, 53 S.Ct., at 1 ('citizen of Mississippi, a qualified elector under its laws, and also qualified to be a candidate for election as Representative in Congress'); cf. Carroll v. Becker, supra (candidate for office).\n\n\n27\n Mr. Justice Rutledge was of the view that any question of standing was settled in Smiley v. Holm, supra; Mr. Justice Black stated 'that petitioner had standing to sue, since the facts alleged show that they have been injured as individuals.' He relied on Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433, 438, 467, 59 S.Ct. 972, 975, 988, 83 L.Ed. 1385. See 328 U.S. 564, 568, 66 S.Ct. 1208, 1209.\nCommentators have suggested that the following statement in Mr. Justice Frankfurter's opinion might imply a view that appellants there had no standing: 'This is not an action to recover for damage because of the discriminatory exclusion of a plaintiff from rights enjoyed by other citizens. The basis for the suit is not a private wrong, but a wrong suffered by Illinois as a polity.' 328 U.S. at 552, 66 S.Ct. at 1199. See Jaffe, Standing to Secure Judicial Review: Public Actions, 74 Harv.L.Rev. 1265, 1298 (1961); Lewis, Legislative Apportionment and the Federal Courts, 71 Harv.L.Rev. 1057, 1081\u20141083 (1958). But since the opinion goes on to consider the merits, it seems that this statement was not intended to intimate any view that the plaintiffs in that action lacked standing. Nor do the cases cited immediately after the above quotation deal with standing. See especially Lane v. Wilson, 307 U.S. 268, 272\u2014273, 59 S.Ct. 872, 874\u2014875, 83 L.Ed. 1291.\n\n\n28\n MacDougall v.

The Cherokees brought an original suit in this Court to enjoin Georgia's assertion of jurisdiction over Cherokee territory and abolition of Cherokee government and laws. Unquestionably the case lay at the vortex of most fiery political embroilment. See 1 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed.), 729\u2014779. But in spite of some broader language in separate opinions, all that the Court held was that it possessed no original jurisdiction over the suit: for the Cherokees could in no view be considered either a State of this Union or a 'foreign state.' Chief Justice Marshall treated the question as one of de novo interpretation of words in the Constitution. The Chief Justice did say that 'The acts of our government plainly recognize the Cherokee nation\nas a state, and the courts are bound by those acts,' but here he referred to their existence 'as a state, as a distinct political society, separated from others * * *.' From there he went to 'A question of much more difficulty * * *. Do the Cherokees constitute a foreign state in the sense of the constitution?' Id., 5 Pet. at 16, 30 U.S. at 16. Thus, while the Court referred to 'the political' for the decision whether the tribe was an entity, a separate polity, it held that whether being an entity the tribe had such status as to be entitled to sue originally was a judicially soluble issue: criteria were discoverable in relevant phrases of the Constitution and in the common understanding of the times. As to this issue, the Court was not hampered by problems of the management of unusual evidence or of possible interference with a congressional program. Moreover, Chief Justice Marshall's dictum that 'It savours too much of the exercise of political power to be within the proper province of the judicial department,' id., 5 Pet. at 20, 30 U.S. at 20, was not addressed to the issue of the Cherokees' status to sue, but rather to the breadth of the claim asserted and the impropriety of the relief sought. Compare Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, 77, 18 L.Ed. 721. The Chief Justice made clear that if the issue of the Cherokees' rights arose in a customary legal context, 'a proper case with proper parties,' it would be justiciable Thus, when the same dispute produced a case properly brought, in which the right asserted was one of protection under federal treaties and laws from conflicting state law, and the relief sought was the voiding of a conviction under that state law, the Court did void the conviction. Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 8 L.Ed. 483. There, the fact that the tribe was a separate polity served as a datum contributing to the result, and despite the consequences in a heated federal-state controversy and the opposition of the other branches of the National Government, the judicial power acted to reverse the State Supreme Court. An example of similar isolation of a political question in the decision of a case is Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 12 L.Ed. 581; see infra.\n\n\n44\n 7 How., at 29. And see 11 The Writings and Speeches of Daniel Webster 217 (1903).\n\n\n45\n See Mowry, The Dorr War (1901), and its exhaustive bibliography. And for an account of circumstances surrounding the decision here, see 2 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed.), 185\u2014195.\n'Dorr himself, head of one of the two groups and held in a Rhode Island jail under a conviction for treason, had earlier sought a decision from the Supreme Court that his was the lawful government. His application for original habeas corpus in the Supreme Court was denied because the federal courts then lacked authority to issue habeas for a prisoner held under a state court sentence. Ex parte Dorr, 3 How. 103, 11 L.Ed. 514.\n\n\n46\n 7 How., at 39.\n\n\n47\n Id., at 39, 40.\n\n\n48\n Even though the Court wrote of unrestrained legislative and executive authority under this Guaranty, thus making its enforcement a political question, the Court plainly implied that the political question barrier was no absolute: 'Unquestionably a military government, established as the permanent government of the State, would not be a republican government, and it would be the duty of Congress to overthrow it.' 7 How., at 45. Of course, it does not necessarily follow that if Congress did not act, the Court would. For while the judiciary might be able to decide the limits of the meaning of 'republican form,' and thus the factor of lack of criteria might fall away, there would remain other possible barriers to decision because of primary commitment to another branch, which would have to be considered in the particular fact setting presented.\nThat was not the only occasion on which this Court indicated that lack of criteria does not obliterate the Guaranty's extreme limits: 'The guaranty is of a republican form of government. No particular government is designated as republican, neither is the exact form to be guaranteed, in any manner especially designated. Here, as in other parts of the instrument, we are compelled to resort elsewhere to ascertain what was intended.\n'The guaranty necessarily implies a duty on the part of the States themselves to provide such a government. All the States had governments when the Constitution was adopted. In all the people participated to some extent, through their representatives elected in the manner specially provided. These governments the Constitution did not change. They were accepted precisely as they were, and it is, therefore, to be presumed that they were such as it was the duty of the States to provide. Thus we have unmistakable evidence of what was republican in form, within the meaning of that term as employed in the Constitution.' Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162, 175\u2014176, 22 L.Ed. 627. There, the question was whether a government republican in form could deny the vote to women.\nIn re Duncan, 139 U.S. 449, 11 S.Ct. 573, 35 L.Ed. 219, upheld a murder conviction against a claim that the relevant codes had been invalidly enacted. The Court there said:\n'By the Constitution, a republican form of government is guaranteed to every state in the Union, and the distinguishing feature of that form is the right of the people to choose their own officers for governmental administration, and pass their own laws in virtue of the legislative power reposed in representative bodies, whose legitimate acts may be said to be those of the people themselves; but, while the people are thus the source of political power, their governments, national and State, have been limited by written constitutions, and they have themselves thereby set bounds to their own power, as against the sudden impulses of mere majorities.' 139 U.S. at 461, 11 S.Ct. at 577. But the Court did not find any of these fundamental principles violated.\n\n\n49\n But cf. Hawke v.

Johnson, 4 Wall. 475, 18 L.Ed. 437, the State sought to enjoin the President from executing the Acts, alleging that his role was purely ministerial. The Court held that the duties were in no sense ministerial, and that although the State sought to compel inaction rather than action, the absolute lack of precedent for any such distinction left the case one in which 'general principles * * * forbid judicial interference with the excrcise of Executive discretion.' 4 Wall., at 499. See also Mississippi v. Stanton, 154 U.S. 554, 14 S.Ct. 1209, 18 L.Ed. 725; and see 2 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed.), 463.\nFor another instance of congressional action challenged as transgressing the Guaranty Clause, see Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 125\u2014126, 20 L.Ed. 122, overruled, Graves v. O'Keefe, 306 U.S. 466, 59 S.Ct. 595, 83 L.Ed. 927.\n\n\n53\n On the other hand, the implication of the Guaranty Clause in a case concerning congressional action does not always preclude judicial action. It has been held that the clause gives Congress no power to impose restrictions upon a State's admission which would undercut the constitutional mandate that the States be on an equal footing. Coyle v. Smith, 221 U.S. 559, 31 S.Ct. 688, 55 L.Ed. 853. And in Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 19 L.Ed. 227, although Congress had determined that the State's government was not republican in form, the State's standing to bring an original action in this Court was sustained.\n\n\n54\n See, infra, 369 U.S., p. 235, 82 S.Ct., p. 720, considering Kidd v. McCanless, 352 U.S. 920, 77 S.Ct. 223, 1 L.Ed.2d 157.\n\n\n55\n Boyd v. Nebraska ex rel. Thayer, 143 U.S. 135, 183, 12 S.Ct. 375, 389, 36 L.Ed. 103 (Field, J., dissenting).\n\n\n56\n Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 5 Cir., 270 F.2d 594, relying upon, inter alia, Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U.S. 161, 28 S.Ct. 40, 52 L.Ed. 151.\n\n\n57\n The Court's opinion was joined by Mr. Justice Douglas, noting his adherence to the dissents in Colegrove and South v. Peters, supra; and the judgment was concurred in by Mr. Justice Whittaker, who wrote that the decision should rest on the Equal Protection Clause rather than on the Fifteenth Amendment, since there had been not solely a denial of the vote (if there had been that at all) but also a 'fencing out' of a racial group.\n\n\n58\n No holding to the contrary is to be found in Cave v. Newell, 246 U.S. 650, 38 S.Ct. 334, 62 L.Ed. 921, dismissing a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Missouri, 272 Mo. 653, 199 S.W. 1014; or in Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 64 S.Ct. 397, 88 L.Ed. 497.\n\n\n59\n The ground of Mr. Justice Rutledge's vote to affirm is further explained in his footnote, 3, 328 U.S. at 566, 66 S.Ct. at 1209: \"The power of a court of equity to act is a discretionary one. * * * Where a federal court of equity is asked to interfere with the enforcement of state laws, it should do so only 'to prevent irreparable injury which is clear and\nimminent.\" American Federation of Labor v. Watson, 327 U.S. 582, (593) 66 S.Ct. 761, 766, (90 L.Ed. 873) and cases cited.'\nNo constitutional questions, including the question whether voters have a judicially enforceable constitutional right to vote at elections of congressmen from districts of equal population, were decided in Colegrove. Six of the participating Justices reached the questions but divided three to three on their merits. Mr. Justice Rutledge believed that it was not necessary to decide them. He said: 'There is (an alternative to constitutional decision) in this case. And I think the gravity of the constitutional questions raised so great, together with the possibilities for collision (with the political departments of the Government), that the admonition (against avoidable constitutional decision) is appropriate to be followed here. Other reasons support this view, including the fact that, in my opinion, the basic ruling and less important ones in Smiley v. Holm, supra, would otherwise be brought into question.' 328 U.S. at 564\u2014565, 66 S.Ct. at 1208. He also joined with his brethren who shared his view that the issues were justiciable in considering that Wood v. Broom, 287 U.S. 1, 53 S.Ct. 1, 77 L.Ed. 131, decided no constitutional questions but 'the Court disposed of the cause on the ground that the 1929 Reapportionment Act, 46 Stat. 21, did not carry forward the requirements of the 1911 Act, 37 Stat. 13, and declined to decide whether there was equity in the bill.' 328 U.S. at 565, 66 S.Ct. at 1208 see also, id., at 573, 66 S.Ct. at 1212. We agree with this view of Wood v. Broom.\n\n\n60\n See also Buford v. State Board of Elections, 206 Tenn. 480, 334 S.W.2d 726; State ex rel. Sanborn v. Davidson County Board of Election Comm'rs, No. 36,391 Tenn.Sup.Ct., Oct. 29, 1954 (unreported); 8 Vand.L.Rev. 501 (1955).\n\n\n1\n I feel strongly that many of the cases cited by the Court and involving so-called 'political' questions were wrongly decided.\nIn joining the opinion, I do not approve those decisions but only construe the Court's opinion in this case as stating an accurate historical account of what the prior cases have held.\n\n\n2\n The statements in Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 42, 12 L.Ed. 581, that this guaranty is enforceable only by Congress or the Chief Executive is not maintainable. Of course the Chief Executive, not the Court, determines how a State will be protected against invasion. Of course each House of Congress, not the Court, is 'the judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its own members.' Article I, Section 5, Clause 1. But the abdication of all judicial functions respecting voting rights (7 How. at 41), however justified by the peculiarities of the charter form of government in Rhode Island at the time of Dorr's Rebellion, states no general principle. It indeed is contrary to the cases discussed in the body of this opinion\u2014the modern decisions of the Court that give the full panoply of judicial protection to voting rights. Today we would not say with Chief Justice Taney that it is no part of the judicial function to protect the right to vote of those 'to whom it is denied by the written and established constitution and laws of the State.' Ibid.\nMoreover, the Court's refusal to examine the legality of the regime of martial law which had been laid upon Rhode Island (id. at 45\u201446) is indefensible, as Mr. Justice Woodbury maintained in his dissent. Id. at 59 et seq. Today we would ask with him: '* * * who\ncould hold for a moment, when the writ of habeas corpus cannot be suspended by the legislature itself, either in the general government or most of the States, without an express constitutional permission, that all other writs and laws could be suspended, and martial law substituted for them over the whole State or country, without any express constitutional license to that effect, in any emergency?' Id. at 67.\nJustice Woodbury went on to say:\n'It would be alarming enough to sanction here an unlimited power, exercised either by legislatures, or the executive, or courts, when all our governments are themselves governments of limitations and checks, and of fixed and known laws, and the people a race above all others jealous of encroachments by those in power. And it is far better that those persons should be without the protection of the ordinary laws of the land who disregard them in an emergency, and should look to a grateful country for indemnity and pardon, than to allow, beforehand, the whole frame of jurisprudence to be overturned, and every thing placed at the mercy of the bayonet.\n'No tribunal or department in our system of governments ever can be lawfully authorized to dispense with the laws, like some of the tyrannical Stuarts, or to repeal, or abolish, or suspend the whole body of them; or, in other words, appoint an unrestrained military dictator at the head of armed men.\n'Whatever stretches of such power may be ventured on in great crises, they cannot be upheld by the laws, as they prostrate the laws and ride triumphant over and beyond them, however the Assembly of Rhode Island, under the exigency, may have hastily supposed that such a measure in this instance was constitutional. It is but a branch of the omnipotence claimed by Parliament to pass bills of attainder, belonging to the same dangerous and arbitrary family with martial law.' Id. at 69\u201470.\nWhat he wrote was later to become the tradition, as expressed by Chief Justice Hughes in Sterling v. Constantin, 287 U.S. 378, 401, 53 S.Ct. 190, 196, 77 L.Ed. 375: 'What are the allowable limits of military discretion, and whether or not they have been overstepped in a particular case, are judicial questions.'\n\n\n3\n The category of the 'political' question is, in my view, narrower than the decided cases indicate. 'Even the English courts have held that a resolution of one House of Parliament does not change the law (Stockdale v. Hansard (1839) 9 A. & E. 1; and Bowles v. Bank of England (No. 2) (1913) 1 Ch. 57), and these decisions imply that the House of Commons acting alone does not constitute the 'Parliament' recognised by the English courts.' 103 Sol.Jour. 995, 996. The Court in Bowles v. Bank of England, (1913) 1 Ch. 57, 84\u201485, stated: 'By the statute 1 W. & M., usually known as the Bill of Rights, it was finally settled that there could be no taxation in this country except under authority of an Act of Parliament. The Bill of Rights still remains unrepealed, and no practice or custom, however prolonged, or however acquiesced in on the part of the subject, can be relied on by the Crown as justifying any infringement of its provisions. It follows that, with regard to the powers of the Crown to levy taxation, no resolution, either of the Committee for Ways and Means or of the House itself, has any legal effect whatever. Such resolutions are necessitated by a parliamentary procedure adopted with a view to the protection of the subject against the hasty imposition of taxes, and it would be strange to find them relied on as justifying the Crown in levying a tax before such tax is actually imposed by Act of Parliament.'\nIn The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U.S. 655, 49 S.Ct. 463, 73 L.Ed. 894, the Court undertook a review of the veto provisions of the Constitution and concluded that the measure in litigation had not become a law. Cf. Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433, 59 S.Ct. 972, 83 L.Ed. 1385.\nGeorgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, 18 L.Ed. 721, involved the application of the Reconstruction Acts to Georgia\u2014laws which destroyed by force the internal regime of that State. Yet the Court refused to take jurisdiction. That question was no more 'political' than a host of others we have entertained. See, e.g., Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U.S. 553, 43 S.Ct. 658, 67 L.Ed. 1117; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 72 S.Ct. 863, 96 L.Ed. 1153; Alabama v. Texas, 347 U.S. 272, 74 S.Ct. 481, 98 L.Ed. 689.\nToday would this Court hold nonjusticiable or 'political' a suit to enjoin a Governor who, like Fidel Castro, takes everything into his own hands and suspends all election laws?\nGeorgia v. Stanton, supra, expresses a philosophy at war with Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 18 L.Ed. 281, and Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U.S. 304, 66 S.Ct. 606, 90 L.Ed. 688. The dominance of the civilian authority has been expressed from the beginning. See Wise v. Withers, 3 Cranch 331, 337, 2 L.Ed. 457; Sterling v. Constantin, supra, note 2.\n\n\n4\n We are told by the National Institute of Municipal Law Officers in an amicus brief:\n'Regardless of the fact that in the last two decades the United States has become a predominantly urban country where well over two-thirds of the population now lives in cities or suburbs, political representation in the majority of state legislatures is 50 or more years behind the times. Apportionments made when the greater part of the population was located in rural communities are still determining and undermining our elections.\n'As a consequence, the municipality of 4960 is forced to function in a horse and buggy environment where there is little political recognition of the heavy demands of an urban population. These demands will become even greater by 1970 when some 150 million people will be living in urban areas.\n'The National Institute of Municipal Law Officers has for many years recognized the wide-spread complaint that by far the greatest preponderance of state representatives and senators are from rural areas which, in the main, fail to become vitally interested in the increasing difficulties now facing urban administrators.\n'Since World War II, the explosion in city and suburban population has created intense local problems in education, transportation, and housing. Adequate handling of these problems has not been possible to a large extent, due chiefly to the political weakness of municipalities. This situation is directly attributable to considerable under-representation of cities in the legislatures of most states.' Amicus brief, pp. 2\u20143.\n\n\n5\n The recent ruling by the Iowa Supreme Court that a legislature, though elected under an unfair apportionment scheme, is nonetheless a legislature empowered to act (City of Cedar Rapids v. Cox, 252 Iowa 948, 964, 108 N.W.2d 253, 262\u2014263; cf. Kidd v. McCanless, 200 Tenn. 273, 292 S.W.2d 40) is plainly correct.\nThere need be no fear of a more disastrous collision between federal and state agencies here than where a federal court enjoins gerrymandering based on racial lines. See Gomillion v. Lightfoot, supra.\nThe District Court need not undertake a complete reapportionment. It might possibly achieve the goal of substantial equality merely by directing respondent to eliminate the egregious injustices. Or its conclusion that reapportionment should be made may in itself stimulate legislative action. That was the result in Asbury Park Press v. Woolley, 33 N.J. 1, 161 A.2d 705, where the state court ruled it had jurisdiction:\n'If by reason of passage of time and changing conditions the reapportionment statute no longer serves its original purpose of securing to the voter the full constitutional value of his franchise, and the legislative branch fails to take appropriate restorative action, the doors of the courts must be open to him. The lawmaking body cannot by inaction alter the constitutional system under which it has its own existence.' 33 N.J. at 14, 161 A.2d at 711. The court withheld its decision on the merits in order that the legislature might have an opportunity to consider adoption of a reapportionment act. For the sequel see Application of Lamb, 67 N.J.Super. 39, 46\u201447, 169 A.2d 822, 825\u2014826.\nReapportionment was also the result in Magraw v. Donovan, D.C., 159 F.Supp. 901, where a federal three-judge District Court took jurisdiction, saying, D.C., 163 F.Supp. 184, 187:\n'Here it is the unmistakable duty of the State Legislature to reapportion itself periodically in accordance with recent population changes. * * * Early in January 1959 the 61st Session of the Minnesota Legislature will convene, all of the members of which will be newly elected on November 4th of this year. The facts which have been presented to us will be available to them. It is not to be presumed that the Legislature will refuse to take such action as is necessary to comply with its duty under the State Constitution. We defer decision on all the issues presented (including that of the power of this Court to grant relief), in order to afford the Legislature full opportunity to 'heed the constitutional mandate to redistrict.\"\nSee, D.C., 177 F.Supp. 803, where the case was dismissed as moot, the State Legislature having acted.\n\n\n1\n The opinion stated at 551, 66 S.Ct., at 1199 that the Court 'could also dispose of this case on the authority of Wood v. Broom (287 U.S. 1, 53 S.Ct. 1, 77 L.Ed. 131 (1932)).' Wood v. Broom involved only the interpretation of a congressional reapportionment Act.\n\n\n2\n Similarly, the Equal Protection Clause was not invoked in Tedesco v. Board of Supervisors, 339 U.S. 940, 70 S.Ct. 797, 94 L.Ed. 1357 (1950).\n\n\n3\n I do not read the later case of Colegrove v. Barrett, 330 U.S. 804, 67 S.Ct. 976, 91 L.Ed. 1262 (1947) as having rejected the equal protection argument adopted here. That was merely a dismissal of an appeal where the equal protection point was mentioned along with attacks under three other constitutional provisions, two congressional Acts, and three state constitutional provisions.\n\n\n4\n Georgia based its election system on a consistent combination of political units and population, giving six unit votes to the eight most populous counties, four unit votes to the 30 counties next in population, and two unit votes to each of the remaining counties.\n\n\n5\n See Part I of the Appendix to Mr. Justice HARLAN'S dissent, 369 U.S., p. 341, 82 S.Ct., p. 776.\n\n\n6\n It is suggested that the districting is not unconstitutional since it was established by a statute that was constitutional when passed some 60 years ago. But many Assembly Sessions since that time have deliberately refused to change the original act, and in any event '(a) statute (constitutionally) valid when enacted may become invalid by change in the conditions to which it is applied.' Nashville, C. & St. L.R. Co. v. Walters, 294 U.S. 405, 415, 55 S.Ct. 486, 488, 79 L.Ed. 949 (1935).\n\n\n7\n 'Total representation' indicates the combined representation in the State Senate (33 members) and the State House of Representatives (99 members) in the Assembly of Tennessee. Assuming a county has one representative, it is credited in this calculation with 1\/99. Likewise, if the same county has one-third of a senate seat, it is credited with another 1\/99, and thus such a county, in our calculation, would have a 'total representation' of two; if a county has one representative and one-sixth of a senate seat, it is credited with 1.5\/99, or 1.50. It is this last figure that I use here in an effort to make the comparisons clear. The 1950 rather than the 1960 census of voting population is used to avoid the charge that use of 1960 tabulations might not have allowed sufficient time for the State to act. However, the 1960 picture is even more irrational than the 1950 one.\n\n\n8\n Of course this was not the case in the Georgia county unit system, South v. Peters, supra, or the Illinois initiative plan, MacDougall v. Green, supra, where recognized political units having independent significance were given minimum political weight.\n\n\n9\n It is interesting to note that state judges often rest their decisions on the ground that this Court has precluded adjudication of the federal claim. See, e.g., Scholle v. Secretary of State, 360 Mich. 1, 104 N.W.2d 63 (1960).\n\n\n10\n Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, 124.\n\n\n11\n Kant, Perpetual Peace.\n\n\n*\n It is worth reminding that the problem of legislative apportionment is not one dividing North and South. Indeed, in the present House of Representatives, for example, Michigan's congressional districts are far less representative of the numbers of inhabitants, according to the 1960 census, than are Louisiana's. Michigan's Sixteenth District, which is 93.1% urban, contains 802,994 persons and its twelfth, which is 47.6% urban, contains 177,431\u2014one-fifth as many persons. Louisiana's most populous district, the Sixth, is 53.6% urban and contains 536,029 persons, and its least populous, the Eighth, 36.7% urban, contains 263,850\u2014nearly half. Gross disregard of any assumption that our political system implies even approximation to the notion that individual votes in the various districts within a State should have equal weight is as true, e.g., of California, Illinois, and Ohio as it is of Georgia. See United States Department of Commerce, Census Release, February 24, 1962, CB62\u201423.\n\n\n1\n See Wood v. Broom, 287 U.S. 1, 53 S.Ct. 1, 77 L.Ed. 131; Colegrove v.

Neely, 50 F.2d 685 (C.A.7th Cir.).\n\n\n2\n Although the motion to intervene by the Mayor of Nashville asserted an interest in the litigation in only a representative capacity, the complaint which he subsequently filed set forth that he was a qualified voter who also sued in his own behalf. The municipalities of Knoxville and Chattanooga purport to represent their residents. Since the claims of the municipal intervenors do not differ materially from those of the parties who sue as individual voters, the Court need not now determine whether the municipalities are proper parties to this proceeding. See, e.g., Stewart v. Kansas City, 239 U.S. 14, 36 S.Ct. 15, 60 L.Ed. 120.\n\n\n3\n The original complaint named as defendants Tennessee's Secretary of State, Attorney General, Coordinator of Elections, and the three members of the State Board of Elections, seeking to make the Board members representatives of all the State's County Election Commissioners. The prayer in an intervening complaint by The City of Knoxville, that the Commissioners of Elections of Knox County be added as parties defendant seems not to have been acted on by the court below. Defendants moved to dismiss, inter alia, on the ground of failure to join indispensable parties, and they argue in this Court that only the County Election Commissioners of the ninety-five counties are the effective administrators of Tennessee's elections laws, and that none of the defendants have substantial duties in connection therewith. The District Court deferred ruling on this ground of the motion. Inasmuch as it involves questions of local law more appropriately decided by judges sitting in Tennessee than by this Court, and since in any event the failure to join County Election Commissioners in this action looking to prospective relief could be corrected, if necessary, by amendment of the complaints, the issue does not concern the Court on this appeal.\n\n\n4\n Jurisdiction is predicated upon R.S. \u00a7 1979, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1343(3).\n\n\n5\n However, counties having two-thirds of the ratio required for a Representative are entitled to seat one member in the House, and there are certain geographical restrictions upon the formation of Senate districts. The applicable provisions of Article II of the Tennessee Constitution are:\n'Sec. 4. Census.\u2014An enumeration of the qualified voters, and an apportionment of the Representatives in the General Assembly, shall be made in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, and within every subsequent term of ten years.'\n'Sec. 5. Apportionment of representatives.\u2014The number of Representatives shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts, according to the number of qualified voters in each; and shall not exceed seventy-five, until the population of the State shall be one million and a half, and shall never exceed ninety-nine; Provided that any county having two-thirds of the ratio shall be entitled to one member.'\n'Sec. 6. Apportionment of senators.\u2014The number of Senators shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified electors in each, and shall not exceed one-third the number of representatives. In apportioning the Senators among the different counties, the fraction that may be lost by any county or counties, in the apportionment of members to the House of Representatives, shall be made up to such county or counties in the Senate, as near as may be practicable. When a district is composed of two or more counties, they shall be adjoining; and no county shall be divided in forming a district.'\n\n\n6\n It is alleged that certain amendments to the Act of 1901 made only minor modifications of that Act, adjusting the boundaries of individual districts in a manner not material to plaintiffs' claims.\n\n\n7\n The exhibits do not reveal the source of the population figures which they set forth, but it appears that the figures were taken from the United States Census of Population, 1950, Volume II, Part 42 (Tennessee), Table 41, at 76\u201491. These census figures represent the total population over twenty-one years of age in each Tennessee County; they do not purport to enumerate 'qualified voters' or 'qualified electors,' the measure of apportionment prescribed by the Tennessee Constitution. See note 5, supra. To qualify to vote in Tennessee, in addition to fulfilling the age requirement, an individual must be a citizen of the United States, a resident of the State for twelve months and of the county where he offers his vote for six months next preceding the election, and must not be under the disqualification attaching to conviction for certain offenses.

The statistics found in the United States Census of Population, 1950, Volume II, Part 42 (Tennessee), Table 42, at 92\u201497, suggest that the residence requirement, in particular, may be an unknown variable of considerable significance. Appellants do not suggest a means by which a court, on the basis of the federal census figures, can determine the number of qualified voters in the various Tennessee counties.\n\n\n8\n The 'county aid funds' derived from a portion of a state gasoline privilege tax, for example, are distributed among the counties as follows: one-half equally among the ninety-five counties, one-quarter on the basis of area, one-quarter on the basis of population, to be used by county authorities in the building, repairing and improving of county roads and bridges. Tenn.Code Ann.1955, \u00a7 54\u2014403. Appellants urge that this distribution is discriminatory.\n\n\n9\n Plaintiffs also suggested, as an alternative to at-large elections, that the District Court might itself redistrict the State. They did not, however, expressly pray such relief.\n\n\n10\n See Bickel, Foreword: The Passive Virtues, 75 Harv.L.Rev. 40, 45 et seq. (1961).\n\n\n11\n See, e.g., United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 634, 635, 4 L.Ed. 471; The Divina Pastora, 4 Wheat. 52, 4 L.Ed. 512; Williams v. Suffolk Ins. Co., 13 Pet. 415, 10 L.Ed. 226; Kennett v.

Compare Foster and Elam v. Neilson, 2 Pet. 253, 7 L.Ed. 415, with United States v. Arredondo, 6 Pet. 691, 8 L.Ed. 547. Of course, judgment concerning the 'political' nature of even a controversy affecting the Nation's foreign affairs is not a simple mechanical matter, and certain of the Court's decisions have accorded scant weight to the consideration of unity of action in the conduct of external relations. Compare Vermilya-Brown Co. v. Connell, 335 U.S. 377, 69 S.Ct. 140, 93 L.Ed. 76, with United States v. Pink, 315 U.S. 203, 62 S.Ct. 552, 86 L.Ed. 796.\n\n\n12\n Obviously, this is the equivalent of saying that the characteristics are not 'constitutionally requisite' in a judicially enforceable sense. The recognition of their necessity as a condition of legislation is left, as is observance of certain other constitutional commands to the conscience of the non-judicial organs. Cf. Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 16 L.Ed. 717.\n\n\n13\n Also compare the Coleman case and United States v. Sprague, 282 U.S. 716, 51 S.Ct. 220, 75 L.Ed. 640, with Hawke v. Smith (No. 1), 253 U.S. 221, 40 S.Ct. 495, 64 L.Ed. 871. See the National Prohibition Cases, State of Rhode Island v. Palmer, 253 U.S. 350, 40 S.Ct. 486, 588, 64 L.Ed. 946; and consider the Court's treatment of the several contentions in Leser v. Garnett, 258 U.S. 130, 42 S.Ct. 217, 66 L.Ed. 505.\n\n\n14\n E.g., Myers v. Anderson, 238 U.S. 368, 35 S.Ct. 932, 59 L.Ed. 1349; Nixon v. Condon, 286 U.S. 73, 52 S.Ct. 484, 76 L.Ed. 984; Lane v. Wilson, 307 U.S. 268, 59 S.Ct. 872, 83 L.Ed. 1281; Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649, 64 S.Ct. 757, 88 L.Ed. 987. The action for damages for improperly rejecting an elector's vote had been given by the English law since the time of Ashby v. White, 1 Brown's Cases in Parliament 62; 2 Ld.Raym. 938; 3 Ld.Raym. 320, a case which in its own day precipitated an intraparliamentary war of major dimensions. See 6 Hansard, Parliamentary History of England (1810), 225\u2014324, 376\u2014436. Prior to the racial-discrimination cases, this Court had recognized the action, by implication, in dictum in Swafford v. Templeton, 185 U.S. 487, 22 S.Ct. 783, 46 L.Ed. 1005, and Wiley v. Sinkler, 179 U.S. 58, 21 S.Ct. 17, 45 L.Ed. 84, both respecting federal elections.\n\n\n15\n Cf. Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110.\n\n\n16\n By statute an action for preventive relief is now given the United States in certain voting cases. 71 Stat. 637, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1971(c), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1971(c), amending R.S. \u00a7 2004. See United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 80 S.Ct. 519, 4 L.Ed.2d 524; United States v. Thomas, 362 U.S. 58, 80 S.Ct. 612, 4 L.Ed.2d 535.\n\n\n17\n Compare Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 9 L.Ed. 1233, and cases following, with Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, 18 L.Ed. 721.\n\n\n18\n Compare Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 8 L.Ed. 483, with Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 20, 28 (Mr. Justice Johnson, concurring), 51 and 75, 8 L.Ed. 25 (Mr. Justice Thompson, dissenting).\n\n\n19\n This was an alternative ground of Chief Justice Marshall's opinion for the Court. Id., at 20. The question which Marshall reserved as 'unnecessary to decide,' ibid., was not the justiciability of the bill in this aspect, but the 'more doubtful' question whether that 'part of the bill which respects the land occupied by the Indians, and prays the aid of the court to protect their possession,' might be entertained. Ibid. Mr. Justice Johnson, concurring, found the controversy non-justiciable and would have put the ruling solely on this ground, id., at 28, and Mr. Justice Thompson, in dissent, agreed that much of the matter in the bill was not fit for judicial determination. Id., at 51, 75.\n\n\n20\n Cf. Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475, 18 L.Ed. 437.\n\n\n21\n Considerations similar to those which determined the Cherokee Nation case and Georgia v. Stanton no doubt explain the celebrated decision in Nabob of the Carnatic v. East India Co., 1 Ves.Jr. *371; 2 Ves.Jr. *56, rather than any attribution of a portion of British sovereignty, in respect of Indian affairs, to the company. The reluctance of the English Judges to involve themselves in contests of factional political power is of ancient standing. In The Duke of York's Claim to the Crown, 5 Rotuli Parl. 375, printed in Wambaugh, Cases on Constitutional Law (1915), 1, the role which the Judges were asked to play appears to have been rather that of advocates than of judges, but the answer which they returned to the Lords relied on reasons equally applicable to either role.\n\n\n22\n 'The United States shall guarantee to every state in this Union a republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened) against domestic violence.'\n\n\n23\n Cf. the cases holding that the Fourteenth Amendment imposes no such restriction upon the form of a State's governmental organization as will permit persons affected by government action to complain that in its organization principles of separation of powers have been violated. E.g., Dryer v. Illinois, 187 U.S. 71, 23 S.Ct. 28, 47 L.Ed. 79; Soliah v. Heskin, 222 U.S. 522, 32 S.Ct. 103, 56 L.Ed. 294; Houck v. Little River Drainage District, 239 U.S. 254, 36 S.Ct. 58, 60 L.Ed. 266. The same consistent refusal of this Court to find that the Federal Constitution restricts state power to design the structure of state political institutions is reflected in the cases rejecting claims arising out of the States' creation, alteration, or destruction of local subdivisions or their powers, insofar as these claims are made by the subdivisions themselves, see Laramie County Com'rs v. Albany County, 92 U.S. 307, 23 L.Ed. 552; Pawhuska v. Pawhuska Oil & Gas Co., 250 U.S. 394, 39 S.Ct. 526, 63 L.Ed. 1054; Trenton v. New Jersey, 262 U.S. 182, 43 S.Ct. 534, 67 L.Ed. 937; Risty v. Chicago, R.I. & P.R. Co., 270 U.S. 378, 389 390, 46 S.Ct. 236, 241, 70 L.Ed. 641; Williams v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 289 U.S. 36, 53 S.Ct. 431, 77 L.Ed. 1015, or by the whole body of their residents who share only a general, undifferentiated interest in their preservation. See Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U.S. 161, 28 S.Ct. 40, 52 L.Ed. 151. The policy is also given effect by the denial of 'standing' to persons seeking to challenge state action as infringing the interest of some separate unit within the State's administrative structure\u2014a denial which precludes the arbitrament by federal courts of what are only disputes over the local allocation of government functions and powers. See, e.g., Smith v. Indiana, 191 U.S. 138, 24 S.Ct. 51, 48 L.Ed. 125; Braxton County Court v. West Virginia, 208 U.S. 192, 28 S.Ct. 275, 52 L.Ed. 450; Marshall v. Dye, 231 U.S. 250, 34 S.Ct. 92, 58 L.Ed. 206; Stewart v. Kansas City, 239 U.S. 14, 36 S.Ct. 15, 60 L.Ed. 120.\n\n\n24\n 223 U.S., at 141, 32 S.Ct. at 227. '* * * (T)he contention, if held to be sound, would necessarily affect the validity, not only of the particular statute which is before us, but of every other statute passed in Oregon since the adoption of the initiative and referendum. And indeed, the propositions go further than this, since in their essence they assert that there is no governmental function, legislative or judicial, in Oregon, because it cannot be assumed, if the proposition be well founded, that there is, at one and the same time, one and the same government which is republican in form, and not of that character.' Compare Luther v. Borden, 7 How, 1, 38\u201439, 12 L.Ed. 581:\n'* * * For, if this court is authorized to enter upon this inquiry as proposed by the plaintiff, and it should be decided that the charter government had no legal existence during the period of time above mentioned,\u2014if it had been annulled by the adoption of the opposing government,\u2014then the laws passed by its legislature during that time were nullities; its taxes wrongfully collected; its salaries and compensation to its officers illegally paid; its public accounts improperly settled; and the judgments and sentences of its courts in civil and criminal cases null and void, and the officers who carried their decisions into operation answerable as trespassers, if not in some cases as criminals.\n'When the decision of this court might lead to such results, it becomes it duty to examine very carefully its own powers before it undertakes to exercise jurisdiction.'\n\n\n25\n See Bowen, The Recent Contest in Rhode Island (1844); Frieze, A Concise History of the Efforts to Obtain an Extension of Suffrage in Rhode Island; From the Year 1811 to 1842 (2d ed. 1842); Mowry, The Dorr War (1901); Wayland, The Affairs of Rhode Island (2d ed. 1842).\n\n\n26\n The Court reasoned, with respect to the guarantee against domestic violence also contained in Art. IV, \u00a7 4, that this, too, was an authority committed solely to Congress; that Congress had emplowered the President, not the courts, to enforce it; and that it was inconceivable that the courts should assume a power to make determinations in the premises which might conflict with those of the Executive. It noted further that, in fact, the President had recognized the governor of the charter government as the lawful authority in Rhode Island, although it had been unnecessary to call out the militia in his support.\n\n\n27\n See note 24, supra.\n\n\n28\n Id., at 39, 46\u201447.\n\n\n29\n Id., at 41\u201442.\n\n\n30\n In evaluating the Court's determination not to inquire into the authority of the charter government, it must be remembered that, throughout the country, Dorr 'had received the sympathy of the Democratic press. His cause, therefore, became distinctly a party issue.' 2 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed. 1937), 186.\n\n\n31\n Appellants also allege discrimination in the legislature's allocation of certain tax burdens and benefits. Whether or not such discrimination would violate the Equal Protection Clause if the tax statutes were challenged in a proper proceeding, see Dane v. Jackson, 256 U.S. 589, 41 S.Ct. 566, 65 L.Ed. 1107; cf. Nashville, C. & St. L.R. Co. v. Wallace, 288 U.S. 249, 268, 53 S.Ct. 345, 350, 77 L.Ed. 730, these recitative allegations do not affect the nature of the controversy which appellants' complaints present.\n\n\n32\n Appellants would find a 'right' to have one's ballot counted on authority of United States v. Mosley, 238 U.S. 383, 35 S.Ct. 904, 59 L.Ed. 1355; United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 85 L.Ed. 1368; United States v. Saylor, 322 U.S. 385, 64 S.Ct. 1101, 88 L.Ed. 1341. All that these cases hold is that conspiracies to commit certain sharp election practices which, in a federal election, cause ballots not to receive the weight which the law has in fact given them, may amount to deprivations of the constitutionally secured right to vote for federal officers. But see United States v. Bathgate, 246 U.S. 220, 38 S.Ct. 269, 62 L.Ed. 676. The cases do not so much as suggest that there exists a constitutional limitation upon the relative weight to which the law might properly entitle respective ballots, even in federal elections.\n\n\n33\n Mackenzie, Free Elections (1958) (hereafter, Mackenzie), 108.\n\n\n34\n Ogg, English Government and Politics (2d ed. 1936) (hereafter Ogg), 248\u2014250, 257; Seymour, Electoral Reform in England and Wales (1915) (hereafter, Seymour), 46\u201447.\n\n\n35\n Ogg 257\u2014259; Seymour 45\u201452; Carpenter, The Development of American Political Thought (1930) (hereafter, Carpenter), 45\u201446.\n\n\n36\n Ogg 258.\n\n\n37\n Seymour 51.\n\n\n38\n The Federalist, No. 56 (Wright ed. 1961), at 382.

Some counted all inhabitants, e.g., N.J.Const.1844, Art. IV, \u00a7 3; some, only white inhabitants, e.g., Ill.Const.1848, Art. III, \u00a7 8; some, male inhabitants over twenty-one, e.g., Ind.Const.1851, Art. IV, \u00a7\u00a7 4 5; some, qualified voters, e.g., Tenn.Const.1834, Art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 4 to 6; some excluded aliens, e.g., N.Y.Const.1846, Art. III, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5 (and untaxed persons of color); some excluded untaxed Indians and military personnel, e.g., Neb.Const.1866\u20141867, Art. II, \u00a7 3. For present purposes these differences, although not unimportant as revealing fundamental divergences in representation theory, will be disregarded.\n\n\n85\n Ore.Const.1857, Art. IV, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6, 7; Ill.Const.1848, Art. III, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 9; Ind.Const.1851, Art. IV, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5, 6; Minn.Const.1857, Art. IV, \u00a7 2; Wis.Const.1848, Art.

Nevada's Constitution of 1864, Art. XV, \u00a7 13, provided that the federal censuses and interim state decennial enumerations should serve as the bases of representation for both houses, but did not expressly require either numerical equality or reapportionment at fixed intervals.\nSeveral of these constitutions contain provisions which forbid splitting counties or which otherwise require recognition of local boundaries. See, e.g., the severe restriction in Ill.Const.1848, Art. III, \u00a7 9. Such provisions will almost inevitably produce numerical inequalities. See, for example, University of Oklahoma, Bureau of Government Research, Legislative Apportionment in Oklahoma (1956), 21\u201423. However, because their effect in this regard will turn on idiosyncratic local factors, and because other constitutional provisions are a more significant source of inequality, these provisions are here disregarded.\n\n\n86\n Tenn.Const.1834, Art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 4 to 6 (two-thirds of a ratio entitles a county to one representative in the House); W.Va.Const.1861\u20141863, Art. IV, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 (one-half of a ratio entitles a county to one representative in the House); Mich.Const.1850, Art. IV, \u00a7\u00a7 2 to 4 (one-half of a ratio entitles each county thereafter organized to one representative in the House). In Oregon and Iowa a major-fraction rule applied which gave a House seat not only to counties having a moiety of a single ratio, but to all counties having more than half a ratio in excess of the multiple of a ratio.

The county and Assembly line legal restrictions operate outside the framework of theoretically 'equal in population districts.' All the factors might conceivably have the same weight in one situation; in another, some factors might be considerably more important than others in making the final determination.' A Virginia legislative committee adverted to '* * * many difficulties such as natural topographical barriers, divergent business and social interests, lack of communication by rail or highway, and disinclinations of communities to breaking up political ties of long standing, resulting in some cases of districts requesting to remain with populations more than their averages rather than have their equal representation with the changed conditions.'

Are you impugning the integrity of our Federal judiciary?\n'Mr. KASEM. No; I just recognize their human frailties.'\nFor an instance of a court torn, in fact or fancy, over the political issues involved in reapportionment, see State ex rel. Lashly v. Becker, 290 Mo. 560, 235 S.W. 1017, and especially the dissenting opinion of Higbee, J., 290 Mo., at 613, 235 S.W., at 1037.\n\n\n149\n See text at notes 139\u2014143, supra.\n\n\n150\n Decisions of state courts which have entertained apportionment cases under their respective state constitutions do not, of course, involve the very different considerations relevant to federal judicial intervention. State-court adjudication does not involve the delicate problems of federal-state relations which would inhere in the exercise of federal judicial power to impose restrictions upon the States' shaping of their own governmental institutions. Moreover, state constitutions generally speak with a specificity totally lacking in attempted utilization of the generalities of the Fourteenth Amendment to apportionment matters. Some expressly commit apportionment to state judicial review, see, e.g., N.Y.Const.1938, Art. III, \u00a7 5, and even where they do not, they do precisely fix the criteria for judicial judgment respecting the allocation of representative strength within the electorate. See, e.g., Asbury Park Press, Inc. v. Woolley, 33 N.J. 1, 161 A.2d 705.\n\n\n151\n Appellants' suggestion that, although no relief may need be given, jurisdiction ought to be retained as a 'spur' to legislative action does not merit discussion.\n\n\n152\n See note 24, supra.\n\n\n1\n The relevant provisions of the Tennessee Constitution are Art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 6:\n'Sec. 5. Apportionment of representatives.\u2014The number of Representatives shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts, according to the number of qualified voters in each; and shall not exceed seventy-five, until the population of the State shall be one million and a half, and shall never exceed ninety-nine; Provided that any county having two-thirds of the ratio shall be entitled to one member.\n'Sec. 6. Apportionment of senators.\u2014The number of Senators shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified electors in each, and shall not exceed one-third the number of representatives. In apportioning the Senators among the different counties, the fraction that may be lost by any county or counties, in the apportionment of members to the House of Representatives, shall be made up to such county or counties in the Senate, as near as may be practicable. When a district is composed of two or more counties, they shall be adjoining; and no counties shall be divided in forming a district.'\n\n\n2\n This formula is not clearly spelled out in the opinion, but it is necessarily inferred from the figures that are presented. Knox County, for example, is said to have a 'total representation' of 7.25. It elects (1) three direct representatives (value 3.00); (2) one representative from a two-county district (value .50); (3) one direct senator (value 3.00); and (4) one senator in a four-county district (value .75). See Appendix to opinion of MR. JUSTICE CLARK, 369 U.S., pp. 262 264, 82 S.Ct., pp. 734\u2014736.\n\n\n3\n If this 'adjusted' formula for measuring 'total representation' is applied to the other 'horribles' cited in the concurring opinion (369 U.S., p. 255, 82 S.Ct., pp. 730, 731), it reveals that these counties\u2014which purportedly have equal 'total representation' but distinctly unequal voting population\u2014do not have the same 'total representation' at all. Rather than having the same representation as Rutherford County, Moore County has only about 40% of what Rutherford has. Decatur County has only 55% of the representation of Carter County. While Loudon and Anderson Counties are substantially underrepresented, this is because of their proximity to Knox County, which outweighs their votes in the Sixth Senatorial District and in the Eighth Floterial District.\n\n\n4\n These disparities are as serious, if not more so, when my Brother CLARK'S formula is applied to the appellants' proposal. For example, if the seven counties chosen by him as illustrative are examined as they would be represented under the appellants' distribution, Moore County, with a voting population of 2,340, is given more electoral strength than Decatur County, with a voting population of 5,563. Carter County (voting population 23,302) has 20% more 'total representation' that Anderson County (voting population 33,990), and 33% more than Rutherford County (voting population 25,316).\n\n\n5\n Murfreesboro, Rutherford County (pop. 16,017); Elizabethton, Carter County (pop. 10,754); Oak Ridge, Anderson County (pop. 27,387). Tennessee Blue Book, 1960, pp. 143\u2014149.\n\n\n6\n For example, Carter and Washington Counties are each approximately 60% as large as Maury and Madison Counties in terms of square miles, and this may explain the disparity between their 'total representation' figures.\n\n\n7\n For example, in addition to being 'semi-urban,' Blount County is the location of the City of Alcoa, where the Aluminum Company of America has located a large aluminum smelting and rolling plant. This may explain the difference between its 'total representation' and that of Gibson County, which has no such large industry and contains no municipality as large as Maryville.\n\n\n8\n For example, Chester County (voting population 6,391) is one of those that is presently said to be overrepresented. But under the appellants' proposal, Chester would be combined with populous Madison County in a 'floterial district' and with four others, including Shelby County, in a senatorial district. Consequently, its total representation according to the Appendix to my Brother CLARK'S opinion would be .19. (369 U.S., p. 262, 82 S.Ct., p. 734.) This would have the effect of disenfranchising all the county's voters. Similarly, Rhea County's almost 9,000 voters would find their voting strength so diluted as to be practically nonexistent.\n\n\n9\n For example, it is primarily the eastern portion of the State that is complaining of malapportionment (along with the Cities of Memphis and Nashville). But the eastern section is where industry is principally located and where population density, even outside the large urban areas, is highest. Consequently, if Tennessee is apportioning in favor of its agricultural interests, as constitutionally it was entitled to do, it would necessarily reduce representation from the east.\n\n\n10\n For example, sound political reasons surely justify limiting the legislative chambers to workable numbers; in Tennessee, the House is set at 99 and the Senate at 33. It might have been deemed desirable, therefore, to set a ceiling on representation from any single county so as not to deprive others of individual representation. The proportional discrepancies among the four counties with large urban centers may be attributable to a conscious policy of limiting representation in this manner.\n\n\n11\n For example, Moore County is surrounded by four counties each of which has sufficient voting population to exceed two-thirds of the average voting population per county (which is the standard prescribed by the Tennessee Constitution for the assignment of a direct representative), thus qualifying for direct representatives. Consequently Moore County must be assigned a representative of its own despite its small voting population because it cannot be joined with any of its neighbors in a multicounty district, and the Tennessee Constitution prohibits combining it with nonadjacent counties.

Their convictions, each carrying a $10,000 fine and five years' imprisonment, were affirmed by this Court on June 4, 1951, in Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494, 71 S.Ct. 857, 95 L.Ed. 1137. After their convictions, petitioners had been enlarged on bail, and following the affirmance, the United States Attorney served counsel for the petitioners on June 28, 1951, with copies of a proposed order on mandate requiring petitioners to surrender to the United States Marshal on July 2 for the execution of their sentences, and with a notice that such order would be presented to the District Court for signature on the indicated day of surrender. Petitioners were thereupon informed by their counsel that their presence in court would be required on July 2. Both, however, disappeared from their homes, failed to appear in court when the surrender order was signed on July 2, and remained fugitives for more than four and a half years. Ultimately both voluntarily surrendered to the United States Marshal in New York, Green on February 27, 1956, and Winston on March 5, 1956.\n\n\n2\nShortly thereafter, the United States instituted criminal contempt proceedings against the petitioners in the District Court for willful disobedience of the surrender order in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401 (see 78 S.Ct. at page 635, infra). Pursuant to Rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A., these proceedings were tried to the court without a jury.1 Following a hearing, the court found petitioners guilty of the contempts charged and sentenced each to three years' imprisonment to commence after service of the five-year sentences imposed in the conspiracy case. See 140 F.Supp. 117 (opinion as to Green). The Court of Appeals affirmed, 2 Cir., 241 F.2d 631, and we granted certiorari because the case presented important issues relating to the scope of the power of federal district courts to convict and sentence for criminal contempts. 353 U.S. 972, 77 S.Ct. 1057, 1 L.Ed.2d 1135.\n\n\n3\nThe petitioners urge four grounds for reversal, namely: (1) the criminal contempt power of federal courts does not extend to surrender orders; (2) even if such power exists, the evidence was insufficient to support the judgments of contempt; (3) a prison sentence for criminal contempt cannot, as a matter of law, exceed one year; and (4) in any event the three-year sentences imposed were so excessive as to constitute an abuse of discretion on the part of the District Court. For the reasons given hereafter we think that none of these contentions can be sustained, and that the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be upheld.\n\n\n4\n* The contempt judgments rest on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401, which in pertinent part provides that a federal court:\n\n\n5\n'* * * shall have power to punish by fine or imprisonment, at      its discretion, such contempt of its authority, and none      other, as\u2014\n\n\n6\n'(3) Disobedience or resistance to its lawful * * * order * *      *.' Since the order here issued was beyond dispute 'lawful,' \u00a7 401 plainly empowered the District Court to punish petitioners for disobeying it unless, as petitioners claim, this order is outside the scope of subdivision (3). This claim rests on the argument that the statute, viewed in its historical context, does not embrace an order requiring the surrender of a bailed defendant.\n\n\n7\nAn evaluation of this argument requires an analysis of the course of development of federal statutes relating to criminal contempts. The first statute bearing on the contempt powers of federal courts was enacted as \u00a7 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 83. It stated that federal courts 'shall have power to * * * punish by fine or imprisonment, at the discretion of said courts, all contempts of authority in any cause or hearing before the same * * *.' The generality of this language suggests that \u00a7 17 was intended to do no more than expressly attribute to the federal judiciary those powers to punish for contempt possessed by English courts at common law. Indeed, this Court has itself stated that under \u00a7 17 the definition of contempts and the procedure for their trial were 'left to be determined according to such established rules and principles of the common law as were applicable to our situation.' Ex parte Savin, 131 U.S. 267, 275 276, 9 S.Ct. 699, 701, 33 L.Ed. 150.2 At English common law disobedience of a writ under the King's seal was early treated as a contempt, 4 Blackstone Commentaries 284, 285; Beale, Contempt of Court, 21 Harv.L.Rev. 161, 164\u2014167; Fox, The Summary Process to Punish Contempt, 25 L.Q.Rev. 238, 249, and over the centuries English courts came to use the King's seal as a matter of course as a means of making effective their own process. Beale, at 167. It follows that under the Judiciary Act of 1789 the contempt powers of the federal courts comprehended the power to punish violations of their own orders.3\n\n\n8\nSo much the petitioners recognize. They point out, however, that, at early English law, courts dealt with absconding defendants not by way of contempt, but under the ancient doctrine of outlawry, a practice whereby the defendant was summoned by proclamation to five successive county courts and, for failure to appear, was declared forfeited of all his goods and chattels. 4 Blackstone Commentaries 283, 319. In view of this distinct method at English common law of punishing refusal to respond to this summons, which was the equivalent of the present surrender order, petitioners argue that \u00a7 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, incorporating English practice, did not reach to a surrender order, and that the unique status of such an order subsisted under all statutory successors to \u00a7 17, including \u00a7 401(3) of the existing contempt statute.\n\n\n9\nWe find these arguments unconvincing. The reasons for the early English practice of proceeding against absconding defendants by way of outlawry rather than by contempt are obscure. It may have been that outlawry was resorted to because absconding was regarded so seriously as to require the drastic penalties of outlawry rather than fine or imprisonment. But whatever the reasons may have been, the fact that English courts adhered to the practice of dealing with such cases by outlawry should not obscure the general principle that they had power to treat willful disobedience of their orders as contempts of court. It is significant that, so far as we know, the severe remedy of outlawry, which fell into early disuse in the state courts, was never known to the federal law. See United States v. Hall, 2 Cir., 198 F.2d 726, 727\u2014728. Its unavailability to federal courts, and the absence of any other sanctions for the disobedience of surrender orders, are in themselves factors which point away from the conclusion that the kind of power traditionally used to assure respect for a court's process should be found wanting in this one instance.\n\n\n10\nThe subsequent development of the federal contempt power lends no support to the petitioners' position, for the significance of the Act of 1831, 4 Stat. 487, 488, lies quite in the opposite direction. Sentiment for passage of that Act arose out of the impeachment proceedings instituted against Judge James H. Peck because of his conviction and punishment for criminal contempt of a lawyer who had published an article critical of a decision of the judge then on appeal. Although it is true that the Act marks the first congressional step to curtail the contempt powers of the federal courts, the important thing to note is that the area of curtailment related not to punishment for disobedience of court orders but to punishment for conduct of the kind that had provoked Judge Peck's controversial action. As to such conduct, the 1831 Act confined the summary power of punishment to '* * * misbehaviour of any person * * * in the presence of the * * * courts, or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice * * *.' The cases in this Court which have curbed the exercise of the contempt power by federal courts have concerned this clause, as found in statutory successors to the Act of 1831 including subdivision (1) of present 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401, or a further clause in the Act and its successors dealing with misbehavior of court 'officers,' now found in subdivision (2) of \u00a7 401.4\n\n\n11\nIn contrast to the judicial restrictions imposed on the contempt power exercisable under the clauses now found in subdivisions (1) and (2) of \u00a7 401, we find no case suggesting that subdivision (3) of \u00a7 401, before us here, is open to any but its obvious meaning. This clause also finds its statutory source in the Act of 1831, which first made explicit the authority of federal courts to punish for conduct of the kind involved in this case by providing that the contempt power should extend to '* * * disobedience or resistance * * * to any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command * * *' of a federal court. Particularly in the basence of any showing that the old practice of outlawry was ever brought to the attention to Congress, there is no warrant for engrafting upon this unambiguous clause a dubious exception to the English contempt power stemming from this practice. Although the 1831 Act no doubt incorporated many of the concepts of the English common law, its legislative history indicates that Congress sought to define independently the contempt powers of federal courts rather than to have the Act simply reflect all the oddities of early English practice. The House Committee which reported the bill had been directed 'to inquire into the expediency of defining by statute all offences which may be punished as contempts of * * *' federal courts. 7 Cong.Deb., 21st Cong., 2d Sess. (Gale's & Seaton's Reg.), pp. 560 561. (Italics added.) See Frankfurter and Landis, Power to Regulate Contempts, 37 Harv.L.Rev. 1010, 1024\u20141028.\n\n\n12\nEntirely apart from the historical argument, there are no reasons of policy suggesting a need for limitation of the contempt power in this situation. As the present cases evidence, the issuance of a bench warrant and the forfeiture of bail following flight have generally proved inadequate to dissuade defendants from defying court orders. See Willoughby (1929), Principles of Judicial Administration, 561\u2014566. At the time these contempts were committed bail-jumping itself was not a criminal offense, and considerations in past decisions limiting the scope of the contempt power where the conduct deemed to constitute a contempt was also punishable as a substantive crime are not here relevant. Cf. Ex parte Hudgings, 249 U.S. 378, 382, 39 S.Ct. 337, 339, 63 L.Ed. 656. There is small justification for permitting a defendant the assurance that his only risk in disobeying a surrender order is the forfeiture of a known sum of money, particularly when such forfeiture may result in injury only to a bail surety.\n\n\n13\nIt may be true, as petitioners state, that this case and those of the other absconding Dennis defendants, United States v. Thompson, 2 Cir., 214 F.2d 545; United States v. Hall, 2 Cir., 198 F.2d 726, provide the first instances where a federal court has exercised the contempt power for disobedience of a surrender order. But the power to punish for willful disobedience of a court order, once found to exist, cannot be said to have atrophied by disuse in this particular instance. Indeed, when Congress in 1954 made bail-jumping a crime in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3146, it expressly preserved the contempt power in this very situation. We find support in neither history nor policy to carve out so singular an exception from the clear meaning of \u00a7 401(3).\n\nII.\n\n14\nPetitioners contend that the evidence was insufficient to support their contempt convictions, in that it failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt their knowledge of the existence of the surrender order. The Court of Appeals did not address itself to this contention, considering the issue foreclosed by its prior decisions in the Thompson and Hall cases, supra, where the evidence as to those other two Dennis defendants who were convicted of similar criminal contempts was identical with that involved here, except as to the circumstances of their ultimate apprehension.\n\n\n15\nIn this Court, petitioners interpret the District Court's opinion to rest the contempt convictions on alternative theories: (a) that the petitioners had actual knowledge of the issuance of the July 2 surrender order, or (b) that they at least had notice of its prospective issuance and hence were chargeable with knowledge that it was in fact issued. But we find no such dual aspect to the District Court's decision, which rested solely on findings that, beyond a reasonable doubt, Green 'knowingly disobeyed' the surrender order and Winston absented himself 'with knowledge' of the order. Since we are satisfied that the record supports these findings, we need not consider whether mere notice of the prospective issuance of the order, cf. Pettibone v. United States, 148 U.S. 197, 206\u2014207, 13 S.Ct. 542, 546, 37 L.Ed. 419, would be sufficient to sustain these convictions on the theory that petitioners were chargeable as a matter of law with notice that it was later issued.\n\n\n16\nThe evidence for the Government, there being none offered by the defense, related to three time intervals: (1) the period up to June 28, 1951; (2) the four-day interval between June 28, when the proposed surrender order was served on counsel with the notice of settlement, and July 2, when the surrender order was signed; and (3) the period ending with the surrender of the petitioners February 27, 1956, in the case of Green, and March 5, 1956, in the case of Winston.\n\n\n17\n1. The judgments of conviction upon the conspiracy indictment under the Smith Act were entered, and the petitioners were sentenced, on October 21, 1949. On November 2, 1949, the Court of Appeals admitted the petitioners to bail pending appeal upon separate recognizances, signed by each petitioner on November 3, by which each undertook, among other things, to\n\n\n18\n'surrender himself in execution of the judgment and sentence      appealed from upon such day as the District Court of the      United States for the Southern District of New York may      direct, if the judgment and sentence appealed from shall be      affirmed * * *.' (Italics added.)\n\n\n19\nFollowing the Court of Appeals' affirmance of the conspiracy convictions on August 1, 1950, United States v. Dennis, 2 Cir., 183 F.2d 201, Mr. Justice Jackson, as Circuit Justice, continued petitioners' bail on September 25, 1950, pending review of the convictions by this Court. Williamson v. United States, 2 Cir., 184 F.2d 280. This Court, as noted above, affirmed the conspiracy convictions on June 4, 1951, and on June 22, 1951, Mr. Justice Jackson denied a stay of the Court's mandate.\n\n\n20\n2. On Thursday, June 28, 1951, one of the counsel in the Dennis case accepted service on behalf of all the defendants, including petitioners, of a proposed order on mandate requiring the defendants to 'personally surrender to the United States Marshal for the Southern District of New York * * * on the 2nd day of July, 1951, at 11:05' a.m., together with a notice stating that the proposed order would be presented to the District Court 'for settlement and signature' at 10 a.m. on that day.5 It appears from the testimony of this same counsel and another Dennis counsel that on the following day, Friday, June 29, an unsuccessful request was made to the United States Attorney and the District Court to postpone the defendants' surrender until after the July 4 holiday; that on the same day these lawyers told the petitioners and the other Dennis defendants that they must be in court on Monday, July 2; and that petitioners assured counsel of their appearance on that day.6 On July 2 all of the Dennis defendants surrendered, except the two petitioners, and Hall and Thompson. The surrender order was signed, bench warrants were issued for the arrest of these four, and the proceedings were adjourned to the following day, July 3.\n\n\n21\n3. On July 3 the names of the petitioners were called again in open court, and after interrogating counsel as to their disappearance (see note 6, supra), the court declared their bail forfeited. The petitioners remained in hiding until their eventual surrender, some four and a half years later. Prior to their respective surrenders in February and March, 1956, Green and Winston issued press releases announcing their intention to surrender and 'enter prison.'7 When he turned up on the steps of the courthouse, Green also responded to certain questions put by reporters and stated, among other things, that he intended 'to go to the United States Marshal's office,' this being a requirement found only in the surrender order itself. Winston made a similar statement in his press release.\n\n\n22\nIn summary, one day after counsel was served on June 28 with the proposed order calling for petitioners' surrender on July 2, together with the notice stating that the order would also be presented for the court's signature on that day, petitioners were unequivocally notified by counsel that their presence in court was required on July 2. From these undisputed facts, coupled with petitioners' disappearance, it was certainly permissible for the District Court to infer that petitioners knew of the proposed surrender order, of the failure of counsel's efforts on June 29 to postpone the surrender date, and of the court's intention to sign the order on July 2. We need not decide whether these facts alone would sustain the finding that petitioners knew of the issuance of the surrender order on July 2 as planned, for unquestionably as background they furnished significant support for the District Court's ultimate finding that petitioners' statements to the press at the time of their eventual surrender in 1956 (see note 7, supra) indicated their knowledge of the issuance of the order, a finding strengthened by the fact that the recognizance admitting the petitioners to bail obligated petitioners to surrender for service of sentence only when so directed by the District Court.\n\n\n23\nNo doubt some of this evidence lent itself to conflicting inferences, but those favorable to the petitioners were, in our view, not of such strength as to compel the trier of the facts to reject alternative unfavorable inferences. Our duty as an appellate court is to assess the evidence as a whole under the rigorous standards governing criminal trials, rather than to test by those standards each item of evidence relied on by the District Court. 9 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940), \u00a7 2497; 1 Wharton, Criminal Evidence (12th ed. 1955), \u00a7 16. So viewing the entire record, we think the District Court was justified in finding that the evidence established, beyond a reasonable doubt, petitioners' knowing violations of the surrender order.\n\nIII.\n\n24\nWe deal here with petitioners' claim that the District Court was without power to sentence them to imprisonment for more than one year.\n\n\n25\nSection 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 confirmed the power of federal courts '* * * to punish by fine or imprisonment, at the discretion of said courts * * *' certain contempts. The Act of 1831 simply referred to the power to 'inflict summary punishments,' and present \u00a7 401 contains substantially the above language of the Act of 1789. Petitioners contend that despite the provision for 'discretion,' the power to punish under \u00a7 401 is limited to one year by certain sections of the Clayton Act of 1914, 38 Stat. 730, 738\u2014740, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12 et seq. In any event, we are urged to read such a limitation into \u00a7 401 in order to avoid constitutional difficulties which, it is said, would otherwise confront us.\n\n\n26\nWe turn first to the argument based on the Clayton Act. Sections 21 and 22 of that Act provided that certain rights not traditionally accorded persons charged with contempt, notably the right to trial by jury, should be granted in certain classes of criminal contempts, and that persons tried under these procedures were not subject to a fine of more than $1,000 or imprisonment for longer than six months.8 Section 24 of the Act made these provisions inapplicable to other categories of contempts, including the contempt for which the petitioners here have been convicted,9 and provided that such excluded categories of contempts were to be punished 'in conformity to the usages at law and in equity now prevailing.' (Italics added.) In the re-codification of 1948 the foregoing provisions of the Clayton Act were substantially re-enacted in \u00a7 40210 of the present contempt statute, and the above-quoted clause now reads: 'in conformity to the prevailing usages at law.'\n\n\n27\nPetitioners' argument is that the purpose and effect of the 'usages * * * now prevailing' language of \u00a7 24 of the Clayton Act was to freeze into federal contempt law the sentencing practices of federal courts, which up to that time appear never to have imposed a contempt sentence of more than one year.11 These practices, suggest petitioners, reflect the unarticulated belief of federal courts that criminal contempts are not infamous crimes and hence not subject to punishment by imprisonment for over one year;12 this belief is said to derive from the constitutional considerations to which we shortly turn. In view of this suggested effect of \u00a7 24, petitioners would have us read the 'discretion' vested in federal courts by \u00a7 401 as referring exclusively to the choice between sentencing to fine or imprisonment, or in any event as subject to the unexpressed limitation of one year's imprisonment.\n\n\n28\nParticularly in the context of the rest of the Clayton Act of 1914 we cannot read the 'usages * * * now prevailing' clause of \u00a7 24 as incorporating into the statute the sentencing practices up to that date. In \u00a7 22 the statute specifically restricts to six months the maximum term of imprisonment which may be imposed for commission of any of the contempts described in \u00a7 21. Had Congress also intended to restrict the term of imprisonment for contempts excluded from the operation of the Act by \u00a7 24, it is difficult to understand why it did not make explicit its intention, as it did in \u00a7 22, rather than so subtly express its purpose by proceeding in the devious manner attributed to it by the petitioners. Further, there is no evidence that the past sentencing practices of the courts were ever brought to the attention of Congress. That the federal courts themselves have not considered their sentencing power to be restricted by \u00a7 24 of the Clayton Act or by \u00a7 402 of the present contempt statute is indicated by the fact that in at least nine cases subsequent to 1914, contempt convictions carrying sentences of more than one year have been affirmed by four different Courts of Appeals and on one occasion by this Court.13\n\n\n29\nSuch of the legislative history as is germane here argues against the petitioners and strengthens our conclusions that the 'usages * * * now prevailing' clause of \u00a7 24 of the Clayton Act did no more than emphasize that contempts other than those specified in \u00a7 21 were to be tried under familiar contempt procedures, that is, among other things, by the court rather than a jury. The House Report accompanying the bill which was substantially enacted as \u00a7\u00a7 21, 22 and 24 of the Clayton Act referred to the provisions later forming these sections as dealing '* * * entirely with questions of Federal procedure relating to injunctions and contempts committed without the presence of the court.' H.R.Rep.No. 627, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. 21. There is no evidence of a broader purpose to enact so substantial a rule of substantive law encompassing all criminal contempts.\n\n\n30\nWe are nevertheless urged to read into \u00a7 401 a one-year limitation on the sentencing power in order to avoid constitutional issues which the petitioners deem present in the absence of such a restriction. But in view of what we have shown, the section's provision that a federal court may punish 'at its discretion' the enumerated classes of contempts cannot reasonably be read to allow a court merely the choice between fines and imprisonment. We think the Court of Appeals correctly said: 'The phrase 'at its discretion,' does not mean that the court must choose between fine and imprisonment; the word 'or,' itself provides as much and the words, if so construed, would have been redundant. The term of imprisonment is to be as much in the court's discretion as the fine.' 241 F.2d at page 634.\n\n\n31\nWe therefore turn to petitioners' constitutional arguments. The claim is that proceedings for criminal contempts, if contempts are subject to prison terms of more than one year, must be based on grand jury indictments under the clause of the Fifth Amendment providing: 'No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury * * *.' (Italics added.) Since an 'infamous crime' within the meaning of the Amendment is one punishable by imprisonment in a penitentiary, Mackin v. United States, 117 U.S. 348, 6 S.Ct. 777, 29 L.Ed. 909, and since imprisonment in a penitentiary can be imposed only if a crime is subject to imprisonment exceeding one year, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4083, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4083, petitioners assert that criminal contempts if subject to such punishment are infamous crimes under the Amendment.\n\n\n32\nBut this assertion cannot be considered in isolation from the general status of contempts under the Constitution, whether subject to 'infamous' punishment or not. The statements of this Court in a long and unbroken line of decisions involving contempts ranging from misbehavior in court to disobedience of court orders establish beyond peradventure that criminal contempts are not subject to jury trial as a matter of constitutional right.14 Although appearing to recognize this, petitioners nevertheless point out that punishment for criminal contempts cannot in any practical sense be distinguished from punishment for substantive crimes, see Gompers v. United States, 233 U.S. 604, 610, 34 S.Ct. 693, 695, 58 L.Ed. 1115, and that contempt proceedings have traditionally been surrounded with many of the protections available in a criminal trial.15 But this Court has never suggested that such protections included the right to grand jury indictment. Cf. Ex parte Savin, 131 U.S. 267, 278, 9 S.Ct. 699, 702, 33 L.Ed. 150; Gompers v. United States, supra, 233 U.S. at page 612, 34 S.Ct. at page 696. And of course the summary procedures followed by English courts prior to adoption of the Constitution in dealing with many contempts of court did not embrace the use of either grand or petit jury. See 4 Blackstone Commentaries 283\u2014287. It would indeed be anomalous to conclude that contempts subject to sentences of imprisonment for over one year are 'infamous crimes' under the Fifth Amendment although they are neither 'crimes' nor 'criminal prosecutions' for the purpose of jury trial within the meaning of Art. III, \u00a7 2,16 and the Sixth Amendment.17\n\n\n33\nWe are told however that the decision of this Court denying the right to jury trial in criminal contempt proceedings are based upon an 'historical error' reflecting a misunderstanding as to the scope of the power of English courts at the early common law to try summarily for contempts, and that this error should not here to extended to a denial of the right to grand jury. But the more recent historical research into English contempt practices predating the adoption of our Constitution reveals no such clear error and indicates if anything that the precise nature of those practices is shrouded in much obscurity. And whatever the breadth of the historical error said by contemporary scholarship to have been committed by English courts of the late Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries in their interpretation of English precedents involving the trials of contempts of court, it at least seems clear that English practice by the early Eighteenth Century comprehended the use of summary powers of conviction by courts to punish for a variety of contempts committed within and outside court.18 Such indeed is the statement of English law of 356 U.S. 184, 78 S.Ct. 643, who explicitly recognized use of a summary power by English courts to deal with disobedience of court process. It is noteworthy that the Judiciary Act of 1789, first attempting a definition of the contempt power, was enacted by a Congress with a Judiciary Committee including members of the recent Constitutional Convention, who no doubt shared the prevailing views in the American Colonies of English law as expressed in Blackstone. See Ex parte Burr, 4 Fed.Cas. pages 791, 797, No. 2,186. Against this historical background, this Court has never deviated from the view that the constitutional guarantee of trial by jury for 'crimes' and 'criminal prosecutions' was not intended to reach to criminal contempts. And indeed beginning with the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress has consistently preserved the summary nature of the contempt power in the Act of 1831 and its statutory successors, departing from this traditional notion only in specific instances where it has provided for jury trial for certain categories of contempt.19\n\n\n34\nWe do not write upon a clean slate. The principle that criminal contempts of court are not required to be tried by a jury under Article III or the Sixth Amendment is firmly rooted in our traditions. Indeed, the petitioners themselves have not contended that they were entitled to a jury trial. By the same token it is clear that criminal contempts, although subject, as we have held, to sentences of imprisonment exceeding one year, need not be prosecuted by indictment under the Fifth Amendment. In various respects, such as the absence of a statutory limitation of the amount of a fine or the length of a prison sentence which may be imposed for their commission, criminal contempts have always differed from the usual statutory crime under federal law. As to trial by jury and indictment by grand jury, they possess a unique character under the Constitution.20\n\nIV.\n\n35\nPetitioners contend that the three-year sentences imposed upon them constituted an abuse of discretion on the part of the District Court.\n\n\n36\nWe take this occasion to reiterate our view that in the areas where Congress has not seen fit to impose limitations on the sentencing power for contempts the district courts have a special duty to exercise such an extraordinary power with the utmost sense of responsibility and circumspection. The 'discretion' to punish vested in the District Courts by \u00a7 401 is not an unbridled discretion. Appellate courts have here a special responsibility for determining that the power is not abused, to be exercised if necessary by revising themselves the sentences imposed. This Court has in past cases taken pains to emphasize its concern with the use to which the sentencing power has occasionally been put, both by remanding for reconsideration of contempt sentences in light of factors it deemed important, see Yates v. United States, 355 U.S. 66, 78 S.Ct. 128, 2 L.Ed.2d 95; Nilva v. United States, 352 U.S. 385, 77 S.Ct. 431, 1 L.Ed.2d 415, and by itself modifying such sentences. See United States v. United Mine Workers, 330 U.S. 258, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884. The answer to those who see in the contempt power a potential instrument of oppression lies in assurance of its careful use and supervision, not in imposition of artificial limitations on the power.\n\n\n37\nIt is in this light that we have considered the claim that the sentences here were so excessive as to amount to an abuse of discretion. We are led to reject the claim under the facts of this case for three reasons. First, the contempt here was by any standards a most egregious one. Petitioners had been accorded a fair trial on the conspiracy charges against them and had been granted bail pending review of their convictions by the Court of Appeals and this Court. Nevertheless they absconded, and over four and a half years of hiding culminated not in a belated recognition of the authority of the court, but in petitioners' reassertion of justification for disobeying the surrender order. Second, comparing these sentences with those imposed on the other fugitives in the Dennis case, the sentences here are shorter by a year than that upheld in the Thompson case, and no longer than that inflicted in the Hall case. It is true that Hall and Thompson were apprehended, but the record shows that the District Court took into account the fact that the surrender of these petitioners was voluntary; there is the further factor that the period during which petitioners remained fugitives was longer than that in either the Hall or Thompson case. Third, the sentences were well within the maximum fiveyear imprisonment for bail-jumping provided now by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3146, a statute in which Congress saw fit expressly to preserve the contempt power without enacting any limitation on contempt sentences.\n\n\n38\nIn these circumstances we cannot say that the sentences imposed were beyond the bounds of the reasonable exercise of the District Court's discretion.\n\n\n39\nAffirmed.\n\n\n40\nMr. Justice FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n\n\n41\nIn joining the Court's opinion I deem it appropriate to add a few observations. Law is a social organism, and evolution operates in the sociological domain no less than in the biological. The vitality and therefore validity of law is not arrested by the circumstances of its origin. What Magna Carta has become is very different indeed from the immediate objects of the barons at Runnymede. The fact that scholarship has shown that historical assumptions regarding the procedure for punishment of contempt of court were ill-founded, hardly wipes out a century and a half of the legislative and judicial history of federal law based on such assumptions. Moreover, the most authoritative student of the history of contempt of court has impressively shown that 'from the reign of Edward I it was established that the Court had power to punish summarily contempt committed * * * in the actual view of the Court.' Fox, History of Contempt of Court, 49\u201452.\n\n\n42\nWhatever the conflicting views of scholars in construing more or less dubious manuscripts of the Fourteenth Century, what is indisputable is that from the foundation of the United States the constitutionality of the power to punish for contempt without the intervention of a jury has not been doubted. The First Judiciary Act conferred such a power on the federal courts in the very act of their establishment, 1 Stat. 73, 83, and of the Judiciary Committee of eight that reported the bill to the Senate, five members including the chairman, Senator, later to be Chief Justice, Ellsworth, had been delegates to the Constitutional Convention.1 In the First Congress itself no less than nineteen members, including Madison who contemporaneously introduced the Bill of Rights, had been delegates to the Convention. And when an abuse under this power manifested itself, and led Congress to define more explicitly the summary power vested in the courts, it did not remotely deny the existence of the power but merely defined the conditions for its exercise more clearly, in an Act 'declaratory of the law concerning contempts of court.' Act of Mar. 2, 1831, 4 Stat. 487. Although the judge who had misued the power was impeached, and Congress defined the power more clearly, neither the proponents of the reform nor Congress in its corrective legislation suggested that the established law be changed by making the jury part of the procedure for the punishment of criminal contempt. This is more significant in that such a proposal had only recently been put before Congress as part of the draft penal code of Edward Livingston of Louisiana.\n\n\n43\nNor has the constitutionality of the power been doubted by this Court throughout its existence. In at least two score cases in this Court, not to mention the vast mass of decisions in the lower federal courts, the power to punish summarily has been accepted without question.2 It is relevant to call the roll of the Justices, not including those now sitting, who thus sustained the exercise of this power:\n\nWashington      Gray           Pitney\nMarshall        Blatchford     McReynolds\nJohnson         L. Q. C. Lamar Brandeis\nLivingston      Fuller         Clarke\nTodd            Brewer         Taft\nStory           Brown          Sutherland\nDuval           Shiras         Butler\nClifford        H. E. Jackson  Sanford\nSwayne          White          Stone\nMiller          Peckham        Roberts\nDavis           McKenna        Cardozo\nField           Holmes         Reed\nStrong          Day            Murphy\n\n44\nBradley         Moody          R. H. Jackson\n\nHunt            Lurton         Rutledge\nWaite           Hughes         Vinson\nHarlan          Van Devanter   Minton3\nMatthews        J. R. Lamar\n\n45\nTo be sure, it is never too late for this Court to correct a misconception in an occasional decision, even on a rare occasion to change a rule of law that may have long persisted but also have long been questioned and only fluctuatingly applied. To say that everybody on the Court has been wrong for 150 years and that that which has been deemed part of the bone and sinew of the law should now be extirpated is quite another thing. Decision-making is not a mechanical process, but neither is this Court an originating lawmaker. The admonition of Mr. Justice Brandeis that we are not a third branch of the Legislature should never be disregarded. Congress has seen fit from time to time to qualify the power of summary punishment for contempt that it gave the federal courts in 1789 by requiring in explicitly defined situations that a jury be associated with the court in determining whether there has been a contempt. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3691, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3691; Civil Rights Act of 1957, 71 Stat. 634, 638, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1995, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1995. It is for Congress to extend this participation of the jury, whenever it sees fit to do so, to other instances of the exercise of the power to punish for contempt. It is not for this Court to fashion a wholly novel constitutional doctrine that would require such participation whatever Congress may think on the matter, and in the teeth of an unbroken legislative and judicial history from the foundation of the Nation.4\n\n\n46\nMr. Justice BLACK, with whom The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS concur, dissenting.\n\n\n47\nThe power of a judge to inflict punishment for criminal contempt by means of a summary proceeding stands as an anomaly in the law.1 In my judgment the time has come for a fundamental and searching reconsideration of the validity of this power which has aptly been characterized by a State Supreme Court as, 'perhaps, nearest akin to despotic power of any power existing under our form of government.'2 Even though this extraordinary authority first slipped into the law as a very limited and insignificant thing, it has relentlessly swollen, at the hands of not unwilling judges, until it has become a drastic and pervasive mode of administering criminal justice usurping our regular constitutional methods of trying those charged with offenses against society. Therefore to me this case involves basic questions of the highest importance far transcending its particular facts. But the specific facts do provide a striking example of how the great procedural safeguards erected by the Bill of Rights are now easily evaded by the ever-ready and boundless expedients of a judicial decree and a summary contempt proceeding.\n\n\n48\nI would reject those precedents which have held that the federal courts can punish an alleged violation outside the courtroom of their decrees by means of a summary trial, at least as long as they can punish by severe prison sentences or fines as they now can and do.3 I would hold that the defendants here were entitled to be tried by a jury after indictment by a grand jury and in full accordance with all the procedural safeguards required by the Constitution for 'all criminal prosecutions.' I am convinced that the previous cases to the contrary are wrong\u2014wholly wrong for reasons which I shall set out in this opinion.\n\n\n49\nOrdinarily it is sound policy to adhere to prior decisions but this practice has quite properly never been a blind, inflexible rule. Courts are not omniscient. Like every other human agency, they too can profit from trial and error, from experience and reflection. As others have demonstrated, the principle commonly referred to as stare decisis has never been thought to extend so far as to prevent the courts from correcting their own errors. Accordingly, this Court has time and time again from the very beginning reconsidered the merits of its earlier decisions even though they claimed great longevity and repeated reaffirmation. See, e.g., Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188; Graves v. People of State of New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U.S. 466, 59 S.Ct. 595, 83 L.Ed. 927; Nye v. United States, 313 U.S. 33, 61 S.Ct. 810, 85 L.Ed. 1172.4 Indeed, the Court has a special responsibility where questions of constitutional law are involved to review its decisions from time to time and where compelling reasons present themselves to refuse to follow erroneous precedents; otherwise its mistakes in interpreting the Constitution are extremely difficult to alleviate and needlessly so. See Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 405, 52 S.Ct. 443, 446, 76 L.Ed. 815 (Brandeis, J., dissenting); Douglas, Stare Decisis, 49 Col.L.Rev. 735.\n\n\n50\nIf ever a group of cases called for reappraisal it seems to me that those approving summary trial of charges of criminal contempt are the ones. The early precedents which laid the ground-work for this line of authorities were decided before the actual history of the procedures used to punish contempt was brought to light, at a time when '(w)holly unfounded assumptions about 'immemorial usage' acquired a factitious authority and were made the basis of legal decisions.'5 These cases erroneously assumed that courts had always possessed the power to punish all contempts summarily and that it inhered in their very being without supporting their suppositions by authority or reason. Later cases merely cite the earlier ones in a progressive cumulation while uncritically repeating their assumptions about 'immemorial usage' and 'inherent necessity.'6\n\n\n51\nNo justified expectations would be destroyed by the course I propose. There has been no heavy investment in reliance on the earlier cases; they do not remotely lay down rules to guide men in their commercial or property affairs. Instead they concern the manner in which persons are to be tried by the Government for their alleged crimes. Certainly in this area there is no excuse for the perpetuation of past errors, particularly errors of great continuing importance with ominous potentialities. Apparently even the majority recognizes the need for some kind of reform by engrafting the requirement that punishment for contempt must be 'reasonable'\u2014that irrepressible, vague and delusive standard which at times threatens to engulf the entire law, including the Constitution itself, in a sea of judicial discretion.7 But this trifling amelioration does not strike at the heart of the problem and can easily come to nothing, as the majority's very approval of the grossly disproportionate sentences imposed on these defendants portends.\n\n\n52\nBefore going any further, perhaps it should be emphasized that we are not at all concerned with the power of courts to impose conditional imprisonment for the purpose of compelling a person to obey a valid order. Such coercion, where the defendant carries the keys to freedom in his willingness to comply with the court's directive, is essentially a civil remedy designed for the benefit of other parties and has quite properly been exercised for centuries to secure compliance with judicial decrees. See United States v. United Mine Workers of America, 330 U.S. 258, 330\u2014332, 67 S.Ct. 677, 713\u2014714, 91 L.Ed. 884 (dissenting and concurring opinion). Instead, at stake here is the validity of a criminal conviction for disobedience of a court order punished by a long, fixed term of imprisonment. In my judgment the distinction between conditional confinement of compel future performance and unconditional imprisonment designed to punish past transgressions is crucial, analytically as well as historically, in determining the permissible mode of trial under the Constitution.\n\n\n53\nSummary trial of criminal contempt, as now practiced, allows a single functionary of the state, a judge, to lay down the law, to prosecute those who he believes have violated his command (as interpreted by him), to sit in 'judgment' on his own charges, and then within the broadest kind of bounds to punish as he sees fit. It seems inconsistent with the most rudimentary principles of our system of criminal justice, a system carefully developed and preserved throughout the centuries to prevent oppressive enforcement of oppressive laws, to concentrate this much power in the hands of any officer of the state. No official, regardless of his position or the purity and nobleness of his character, should be granted such autocratic omnipotence. Indeed if any other officer were presumptuous enough to claim such power I cannot believe the courts would tolerate it for an instant under the Constitution. Judges are not essentially different from other government officials. Fortunately they remain human even after assuming their judicial duties. Like all the rest of mankind they may be affected from time to time by pride and passion, by pettiness and bruised feelings, by improper understanding or by excessive zeal. Frank recognition of these common human characteristics, as well as others which need not be mentioned, undoubtedly led to the determination of those who formed our Constitution to fragment power, especially the power to define and enforce the criminal law, among different departments and institutions of government in the hope that each would tend to operate as a check on the activities of the others and a shield against their excesses thereby securing the people's liberty.\n\n\n54\nWhen the responsibilities of lawmaker, prosecutor, judge, jury and disciplinarian are thrust upon a judge he is obviously incapable of holding the scales of justice perfectly fair and true and reflecting impartially on the guilt or innocence of the accused.8 He truly becomes the judge of his own cause. The defendant charged with criminal contempt is thus denied what I had always thought to be an indispensable element of due process of law\u2014an objective, scrupulously impartial tribunal to determine whether he is guilty or innocent of the charges filed against him. In the words of this Court: 'A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process. Fairness of course requires an absence of actual bias in the trial of cases. But our system of law has always endeavored to prevent even the probability of unfairness. To this end no man can be a judge in his own case and no man is permitted to try cases where he has an interest in the outcome. * * * Fair trials are too important a part of our free society to let prosecuting judges be trial judges of the charges they prefer.' In re Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136\u2014137, 75 S.Ct. 623, 625, 99 L.Ed. 942. Cf. Chambers v. State of Florida, 309 U.S. 227, 236\u2014237, 60 S.Ct. 472, 476\u2014477, 84 L.Ed. 716; Tumey v. State of Ohio, 273 U.S. 510, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749; In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 68 S.Ct. 499, 92 L.Ed. 682.\n\n\n55\nThe vices of a summary trial are only aggravated by the fact that the judge's power to punish criminal contempt is exercised without effective external restraint. First, the substantive scope of the offense of contempt is inordinately sweeping and vague; it has been defined, for example, as 'any conduct that tends to bring the authority and administration of the law into disrespect or disregard.'9 It would be no overstatement therefore to say that the offense with the most illdefined and elastic contours in our law is now punished by the harshest procedures known to that law. Secondly, a defendant's principal assurance that he will be fairly tried and punished is the largely impotent review of a cold record by an appellate court, another body of judges. Once in a great while a particular appellate tribunal basically hostile to summary proceedings will closely police contempt trials but such supervision is only isoalted and fleeting. All too often the reviewing courts stand aside readily with the formal declaration that 'the trial judge has not abused his discretion.' But even at its rare best appellate review cannot begin to take the place of trial in the first instance by an impartial jury subject to review on the spot by an uncommitted trial judge. Finally, as the law now stands there are no limits on the punishment a judge can impose on a defendant whom he finds guilty of contempt except for whatever remote restrictions exist in the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments or in the nebulous requirements of 'reasonableness' now promulgated by the majority.\n\n\n56\nIn my view the power of courts to punish criminal contempt by summary trial, as now exercised, is precisely the kind of arbitrary and dangerous power which our forefathers both here and abroad fought so long, so bitterly, to stamp out. And the paradox of it all is that the courts were established and are maintained to provide impartial tribunals of strictly disinterested arbiters to resolve charges of wrongdoing between citizen and citizen or citizen and state.\n\n\n57\nThe Constitution and Bill of Rights declare in sweeping unequivocal terms that 'The Trial of all Crimes * * * shall be by Jury,' that 'In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury,' and that 'No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury.' As it may now be punished criminal contempt is manifestly a crime by every relevant test of reason or history. It was always a crime at common law punishable as such in the regular course of the criminal law.10 It possesses all of the earmarks commonly attributed to a crime. A mandate of the Government has allegedly been violated for which severe punishment, including long prison sentences, may be exacted\u2014punishment aimed at chastising the violator for his disobedience.11 As Mr. Justice Holmes irrefutably observed for the Court in Gompers v. United States, 233 U.S. 604, at pages 610\u2014611, 34 S.Ct. 693, at page 695, 58 L.Ed. 1115: 'These contempts are infractions of the law, visited with punishment as such. If such acts are not criminal, we are in error as to the most fundamental characteristic of crimes as that word has been understood in English speech. So truly are they crimes that it seems to be proved that in the early law they were punished only by the usual criminal procedure * * * and that at least in England, it seems that they still may be and preferably are tried in that way.'12\n\n\n58\nThis very case forcefully illustrates the point. After surrendering the defendants were charged with fleeing from justice, convicted, and given lengthy prison sentences designed to punish them for their flight. Identical flight has now been made a statutory crime by the Congress with severe penalties.13 How can it possibly be any more of a crime to be convicted of disobeying a statute and sent to jail for three years than to be found guilty of violating a judicial decree forbidding precisely the same conduct and imprisoned for the same term?\n\n\n59\nThe claim has frequently been advanced that courts have exercised the power to try all criminal contempts summarily since time immemorial and that this mode of trial was so well established and so favorably regarded at the time the Constitution was adopted that it was carried forward intact, by implication, despite the express provisions of the Bill of Rights requiring completely different and fairer kind of trial for 'all crimes.' The myth of immemorial usage has been exploded by recent scholarship as a mere fiction. Instead it seems clear that until at least the late Seventeenth or early Eighteenth Century the English courts, with the sole exception of the extraordinary and ill-famed Court of Star Chamber whose arbitrary procedures and gross excesses brought forth many of the safe-guards included in our Constitution, neither had nor claimed power to punish contempts committed out of court by summary process. Fox, The History of Contempt of Court; Frankfurter and Landis, Power to Regulate Contempts, 37 Harv.L.Rev. 1010, 1042\u20141052; Beale, Contempt of Court, Criminal and Civil, 21 Harv.L.Rev. 161. Prior to this period such contempts were tried in the normal and regular course of the criminal law, including trial by jury.14 After the Star Chamber was abolished in 1641 the summary contempt procedures utilized by that odious instrument of tyranny slowly began to seep into the common-law courts where they were embraced by judges not averse to enhancing their own power. Still for decades the instances where such irregular procedures were actually applied remained few and far between and limited to certain special situations.\n\n\n60\nThen in 1765 Justice Wilmot declared in an opinion prepared for delivery in the Court of King's Bench (but never actually handed down) that courts had exercised the power to try all contempts summarily since their creation in the forgotten past. Although this bald assertion has been wholly discredited by the painstaking research of the eminent authorities referred to above, and even though Wilmot's opinion was not published until some years after our Constitution had been adopted, nor cited as authority by any court until 1821, his views have nevertheless exerted a baleful influence on the law of contempt both in this country and in England. By the middle of the last century the English courts had come to accept fully his thesis that they inherently possessed power to punish all contempts summarily, in or out of court. Yet even then contempts were often punished by the regular criminal procedures so that this Court could report as late as 1913 that they were still preferably tried in that manner. Gompers v. United States, 233 U.S. 604, 611, 34 S.Ct. 693, 695.15\n\n\n61\nThe Government, relying solely on certain obscure passages in some early law review articles by Fox, contends that while the common-law courts may not have traditionally possessed power to punish all criminal contempts without a regular trial they had always exercised such authority with respect to disobedience of their decrees. I do not believe that the studies of Fox or of other students of the history of contempt support any such claim. As I understand him, Fox reaches precisely the opposite conclusion. In his authoritative treatise, expressly written to elaborate and further substantiate the opinions formed in his earlier law review comments, he states clearly at the outset:\n\n\n62\n'The first of (this series of earlier articles), entitled The      King v. Almon, was written to show that in former times the      offence of contempt committed out of court was tried by a      jury in the ordinary course of law and not summarily by the      Court as at present (1927). The later articles also bear upon      the history of the procedure in matters of contempt. Further inquiry confirmed the opinion originally formed with regard      to the trial of contempt and brought to light a considerable      amount of additional evidence which, with the earlier matter,      is embodied in the following chapters * * *.'16\n\n\n63\nThen in summarizing he asserts that strangers to court proceedings were never punished except by the ordinary processes of the criminal law for contempts committed out of the court's presence until some time after the dissolution of the Star Chamber; he immediately follows with the judgment that parties were governed by the same general rules that applied to strangers.17 Of course he recognizes the antiquity of the jurisdiction of courts to enforce their orders by conditional confinement, but such coercion, as pointed out before, is obviously something quite different from the infliction of purely punitive penalties for criminal contempt when compliance is no longer possible.\n\n\n64\nProfessors Frankfurter and Landis in their fine article likewise unequivocally declare:\n\n\n65\n'* * * the Clayton Act (providing for jury trial of certain      charges of criminal contempt) does nothing new. It is as old      as the best traditions of the common law. * * *\n\n\n66\n'Down to the early part of the eighteenth century cases of      contempt even in and about the common-law courts when not      committed by persons officially connected with the court were      dealt with by the ordinary course of law, i.e., tried by      jury, except when the offender confessed or when the offense      was committed 'in the actual view of the court.' * * * '(U)ntil 1720 there is no instance in the common-law           precedents of punishment otherwise than after trial in           the ordinary course and not by summary process.'18\n\n\n67\nAnd Professor Beale in his discussion of the matter concludes:\n\n\n68\n'As early as the time of Richard III it was said that the      chancellor of England compels a party against whom an order      is issued by imprisonment; and a little later it was said in      the chancery that 'a cecree does not bind the right, but only      binds the person to obedience, so that if the party will not      obey, then the chancellor may commit him to prison till he      obey, and that is all the chancellor can do.' This      imprisonment was by no means a punishment, but was merely to      secure obedience to the writ of the king. Down to within a      century (Beale was writing in 1908) it was very doubtful if      the chancellor could under any circumstances inflict      punishment for disobedience of a decree. * * * In any case      the contempt of a defendant who had violated a decree in      chancery could be purged by doing the act commanded and      paying costs; * * *.\n\n\n69\n'Where the court inflicts a definite term of imprisonment by      way of punishment for the violation of its orders, the case      does not differ, it would seem, from the case of criminal      contempt out of court, and regular process and trial by jury      should be required.'19\n\n\n70\nIn brief the available historical material as reported and analyzed by the recognized authorities in this field squarely refutes the Government's insistence that disobedience of a court order has always been an exception punishable by summary process. Insofar as this particular case is concerned, the Government frankly concedes that it cannot point to a single instance in the entire course of Anglo-American legal history prior to this prosecution and two related contemporary cases where a defendant has been punished for criminal contempt by summary trial after fleeing from court-ordered imprisonment.20\n\n\n71\nThose who claim that the delegates who ratified the Constitution and its contemporaneous Amendments intended to exempt the crime of contempt from the procedural safeguards expressly established by those great charters for the trial of 'all crimes' carry a heavy burden indeed. There is nothing in the Constitution or any of its Amendments which even remotely suggests such an exception. And as the Government points out in its brief, it does not appear that there was a word of discussion in the Constitutional Convention or in any of the state ratifying conventions recognizing or affirming the jurisdiction of courts to punish this crime by summary process, a power which in all particulas is so inherently alien to the method of punishing other public offenses provided by the Constitution.\n\n\n72\nIn the beginning the contempt power with its essentially arbitrary procedures was a petty, insignificant part of our law involving the use of trivial penalties to preserve order in the courtroom and maintain the authority of the courts.21 But since the adoption of the Constitution it has undergone an incredible transformation and growth, slowly at first and then with increasing acceleration, until it has become a powerful and pervasive device for enforcement of the criminal law. It is no longer the same comparatively innocuous power that it was. Its summary procedures have been pressed into service for such far-flung purposes as to prevent 'unlawful' labor practices, to enforce the prohibition laws, to secure civil liberties and now, for the first time in our history, to punish a convict for fleeing from imprisonment.22 In brief it has become a common device for by-passing the constitutionally prescribed safeguards of the regular criminal law in punishing public wrongs. But still worse, its subversive potential to that end appears to be virtually unlimited. All the while the sentences imposed on those found guilty of contempt have steadily mounted, until now they are even imprisoned for years.\n\n\n73\nI cannot help but believe that this arbitrary power to punish by summary process, as now used, is utterly irreconcilable with first principles underlying our Constitution and the system of government it created\u2014principles which were uppermost in the minds of the generation that adopted the Constitution. Above all that generation deeply feared and bitterly abhorred the existence of arbitrary, unchecked power in the hands of any government official, particularly when it came to punishing alleged offenses against the state. A great concern for protecting individual liberty from even the possibility of irresponsible official action was one of the momentous forces which led to the Bill of Rights. And the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Amendments were directly and purposefully designed to confine the power of courts and judges, especially with regard to the procedures used for the trial of crimes.\n\n\n74\nAs manifested by the Declaration of Independence, the denial of trial by jury and its subversion by various contrivances was one of the principal complaints against the English Crown. Trial by a jury of laymen and no less was regarded as the birthright of free men.23 Witness the fierce opposition of the colonials to the courts of admiralty in which judges instead of citizen juries were authorized to try those charged with violating certain laws.24 The same zealous determination to protect jury trial dominated the state conventions which ratified the Constitution and eventually led to the solemn reaffirmation of that mode of trial in the Bill of Rights\u2014not only for all criminal prosecutions but for all civil causes involving $20 or more. See 2 Story, Commentaries on the Constitution (5th ed. 1891), \u00a7\u00a7 1763\u20141768. I find it difficult to understand how it can be maintained that the same people who manifested such great concern for trial by jury as to explicitly embed it in the Constitution for every $20 civil suit could have intended that this cherished method of trial should not be available to those threatened with long imprisonment for the crime of contempt. I am confident that if there had been any inkling that the federal courts established under the Constitution could impose heavy penalties, as they now do, for violation of their sweeping and far-ranging mandates without giving the accused a fair trial by his fellow citizens it would have provoked a storm of protest, to put it mildly. Would any friend of the Constitution have been foolhardy enough to take the floor of the ratifying convention in Virginia or any of a half dozen other States and even suggest such a possibility?25\n\n\n75\nAs this Court has often observed, 'The Constitution was written to be understood by the voters; its words and phrases were used in their normal and ordinary as distinguished from technical meaning,' United States v. Sprague, 282 U.S. 716, 731, 51 S.Ct. 220, 222, 75 L.Ed. 640; '* * * constitutions, although framed by conventions, are yet created by the votes of the entire body of electors in a State, the most of whom are little disposed, even if they were able, to engage in such refinements. The simplest and most obvious interpretation of a constitution, if in itself sensible, is the most likely to be that meant by the people in its adoption,' Lake County v. Rollins, 130 U.S. 662, 671, 9 S.Ct. 651, 652, 32 L.Ed. 1060. Cf. Mr. Justice Holmes in Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U.S. 189, 219\u2014220, 40 S.Ct. 189, 197, 64 L.Ed. 521 (dissenting opinion). It is wholly beyond my comprehension how the generality of laymen, or for that matter even thoughtful lawyers, either at the end of the Eighteenth Century or today, could possibly see an appreciable difference between the crime of contempt, at least as it has now evolved, and other major crimes, or why they would wish to draw any distinction between the two so far as basic constitutional rights were concerned.\n\n\n76\nIt is true that Blackstone in his Commentaries incorporated Wilmot's erroneous fancy that at common law the courts had immemorially punished all criminal contempts without regular trial. Much ado is made over this by the proponents of summary proceedings. Yet at the very same time Blackstone openly classified and uniformly referred to contempt as a 'crime' throughout his treatise, as in fact it had traditionally been regarded and punished at common law.26 Similarly, other legal treatises available in this country during the period when the Constitution was established plainly treated contempt as a 'crime.'27 It seems to me that if any guide to the meaning of the Constitution can be fashioned from the circulation of the Commentaries and these other legal authorities through the former colonies (primarily among lawyers and judges) it is at least as compatible with the view that the Constitution requires a jury trial for criminal contempts as with the contrary notion.\n\n\n77\nBut far more significant, our Constitution and Bill of Rights were manifestly not designed to perpetuate, to preserve inviolate, every arbitrary and oppressive governmental practice then tolerated, or thought to be, in England. Cf. Bridges v. State of California, 314 U.S. 252, 263\u2014268, 62 S.Ct. 190, 194\u2014196, 86 L.Ed. 192. Those who formed the Constitution struck out anew free of previous shackles in an effort to obtain a better order of government more congenial to human liberty and welfare. It cannot be seriously claimed that they intended to adopt the common law wholesale. They accepted those portions of it which were adapted to this country and conformed to the ideals of its citizens and rejected the remainder. In truth there was widespread hostility to the common law in general and profound opposition to its adoption into our jurisprudence from the commencement of the Revolutionary War until long after the Constitution was ratified. As summarized by one historian:\n\n\n78\n'The Revolutionary War made everything connected with the law      of England distasteful to the people at large. The lawyers      knew its value: the community did not. Public sentiment      favored an American law for America. It was quickened by the      unfriendly feeling toward the mother country which became      pronounced toward the close of the eighteenth century and      culminated in the War of 1812.'28\n\n\n79\nAlthough the bench and bar, particularly those who were adherents to the principles of the Federalist Party, often favored carrying forward the common law to the fullest possible extent popular sentiment was overwhelmingly against them.29\n\n\n80\nApologists for summary trial of the crime of contempt also endeavor to justify it as a 'necessity' if judicial orders are to be observed and the needful authority of the courts maintained. 'Necessity' is often used in this context as convenient or desirable. But since we are dealing with an asserted power which derogates from and is fundamentally inconsistent with our ordinary, constitutionally prescried methods of proceeding in criminal cases, 'necessity,' if it can justify at all, must at least refer to a situation where the extraordinary power to punish by summary process is clearly indispensable to the enforcement of court decrees and the orderly administration of justice. Or as this Court has repeatedly phrased it, the courts in punishing contempts should be rigorously restricted to the 'least possible power adequate to the end proposed.' See, e.g., In re Michael, 326 U.S. 224, 227, 66 S.Ct. 78, 79, 90 L.Ed. 30.\n\n\n81\nStark necessity is an impressive and often compelling thing, but unfortunately it has all too often been claimed loosely and without warrant in the law, as elsewhere, to justify that which in truth is unjustifiable. As one of our great lawyers, Edward Livingston, observed in proposing the complete abolition of summary trial of criminal contempts:\n\n\n82\n'Not one of the oppressive prerogatives of which the crown      has been successively stripped, in England, but was in its      day, defended on the plea of necessity. Not one of the      attempts to destroy them, but was deemed a hazardous      innovation.'30\n\n\n83\nWhen examined in closer detail the argument from 'necessity' appears to rest on the assumption that the regular criminal processes, including trial by petit jury and indictment by grand jury, will not result in conviction and punishment of a fair share of those guilty of violating court orders, are unduly slow and cumbersome, and by intervening between the court and punishment for those who disobey its mandate somehow detract from its dignity and prestige. Obviously this argument reflects substantial disrespect for the institution of trial by jury, although this method of trial is\u2014and has been for centuries\u2014an integral and highly esteemed part of our system of criminal justice enshrined in the Constitution itself. Nothing concrete is ever offered to support the innuendo that juries will not convict the same proportion of those guilty of contempt as would judges. Such evidence as is available plus my own experience convinces me that by and large juries are fully as responsible in meting out justice in criminal cases as are the judiciary.31 At the same time, and immeasurable more important, trial before a jury and in full compliance with all of the other protections of the Bill of Rights is much less likely to result in a miscarriage of justice than summary trial by the same judge who issued the order allegedly violated.\n\n\n84\nAlthough some are prone to overlook it, an accused's right to trial by a jury of his fellow citizens when charged with a serious criminal offense is unquestionably one of his most valuable and well-established safeguards in this country.32 In the words of Chief Justice Cooley: 'The law has established this tribunal because it is believed that, from its numbers, the mode of their selection, and the fact that jurors come from all classes of society, they are better calculated to judge of motives, weigh probabilities, and take what may be called a common sense view of a set of circumstances, involving both act and intent, than any single man, however pure, wise and eminent he may be. This is the theory of the law; and as applied to criminal accusations, it is eminently wise, and favorable alike to liberty and to justice.' People v. Garbutt, 17 Mich. 9, 27. Trial by an impartial jury of independent laymen raises another imposing barrier to oppression by government officers. As one of the more perceptive students of our experiment in freedom keenly observed, 'The institution of the jury . . . places the real direction of society in the hands of the governed, or of a portion of the governed, and not in that of the government.' 1 De Tocqueville, Democracy in America (Reeve trans., 1948 ed.), 282. The jury injects a democratic element into the law. This element is vital to the effective administration of criminal justice, not only in safeguarding the rights of the accused, but in encouraging popular acceptance of the laws and the necessary general acquiescence in their application. It can hardly be denied that trial by jury removes a great burden from the shoulders of the judiciary. Martyrdom does not come easily to a man who has been found guilty as charged by twelve of his neighbors and fellow citizens.\n\n\n85\nIt is undoubtedly true that a judge can dispose of charges of criminal contempt faster and cheaper than a jury. But such trifling economies as may result have not generally been thought sufficient reason for abandoning our great constitutional safeguards aimed at protecting freedom and other basic human rights of incalculable value. Cheap, easy convictions were not the primary concern of those who adopted the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Every procedural safeguard they established purposely made it more difficult for the Government to convict those it accused of crimes. On their scale of values justice occupied at least as high a position as economy. But even setting this dominant consideration to one side, what compelling necessity is there for special dispatch in punishing criminal contempts, especially those occurring beyond the courtroom? When the desired action or inaction can no longer be compelled by coercive measures and all that remains is the punishment of past sins there is adequate time to give defendants the full benefit of the ordinary criminal procedures. As a matter of fact any slight delay involved might well discourage a court from resorting to hasty, unnecessary measures to chastise suspected disobedience. I believe that Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for himself and Mr. Justice Brandeis, took his stand on invulnerable ground when he declared that where 'there is no need for immediate action contempts are like any other breach of law and should be dealt with as the law deals with other illegal acts.' Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, 247 U.S. 402, 425\u2014426, 38 S.Ct. 560, 566, 62 L.Ed. 1186 (dissenting opinion).33\n\n\n86\nFor almost a half century the Clayton Act has provided for trial by jury in all cases of criminal contempt where the alleged contempt is also a violation of a federal criminal statute.34 And since 1931 the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 101 et seq., has granted the same right where a charge of criminal contempt is based on the alleged violation of an injunction issued in a labor dispute.35 of calamity and destruction of the of clamity and destruction of the judicial system which preceded, accompanied and briefly followed these reforms, there is no indication whatever that trial by jury has impaired the effectiveness or authority of the courts in these important areas of the law. Furthermore it appears that in at least five States one accused of the crime of contempt is entitled, at least to some degree to demand jury trial where the alleged contempt occurred beyond the courtroom.36 Again, I am unable to find any evidence, or even an assertion, that judicial orders have been stripped of their efficacy or courts deprived of their requisite dignity by the intervention of the jury in those States. So far as can be discerned the wheels of justice have not ground to a halt or even noticeably slowed. After all the English courts apparently got on with their business for six or seven centuries without any general power to try charges of criminal contempt summarily.\n\n\n87\nI am confident that in the long run due respect for the courts and their mandates would be much more likely if they faithfully observed the procedures laid down by our nationally acclaimed charter of liberty, the Bill of Rights.37 Respect and obedience in this country are not engendered\u2014and rightly not\u2014by arbitrary and autocratic procedures. In the end such methods only yield real contempt for the courts and the law. The classic example of this is the use and abuse of the injunction and summary contempt power in the labor field. The federal courts have still not recovered from the scars inflicted by their intervention in that area where Congress finally stepped in and preserved the right of jury trial to all those charged with the crime of contempt.\n\n\n88\nIn the last analysis there is no justification in history, in necessity, or most important in the Constitution for trying those charged with violating a court's decree in a manner wholly different from those accused of disobeying any other mandate of the state. It is significant that neither the Court nor the Government makes any serious effort to justify such differentiation exept that it has been sanctioned by prior decisions. Under the Constitution courts are merely one of the coordinate agencies which hold and exercise governmental power. Their decrees are simply another form of sovereign directive aimed at guiding the citizen's activity. I can perceive nothing which places these decrees on any higher or different plane than the laws of Congress or the regulations of the Executive insofar as punishment for their violation is concerned. There is no valid reason why they should be singled out for an extraordinary and essentially arbitrary mode of enforcement. Unfortunately judges and lawyers have told each other the contrary so often that they have come to accept it as the gospel truth. In my judgment trial by the same procedures, constitutional and otherwise, which are extended to criminal defendants in all other instances is also wholly sufficient for the crime of contempt.\n\n\n89\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom The CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting.\n\n\n90\nI dissent because I do not believe that the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the petitioners' guilt of the criminal contempt charged.\n\n\n91\nPetitioners were among 11 leaders of the Communist Party who were convicted of violation of the Smith Act, now 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2385, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2385, on October 14, 1949. Both were sentenced to a fine of $10,000 and to five years' imprisonment, and were enlarged on bail pending appeal. The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions on August 1, 1950, and this Court in turn affirmed on June 4, 1951. Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494, 71 S.Ct. 857, 95 L.Ed. 1137. On June 28, 1951, prior to formal receipt of the Suprme Court judgment, the District Court drew up a proposed Order on Mandate making the judgment of this Court that of the District Court. The last paragraph 'Further ordered, adjudged and decreed that the defendants personally surrender to the United States Marshal * * * on the 2nd day of July, 1951 * * *.' This proposed order was served on the attorneys for the 11 and they promised to bring their clients into court the following Monday, July 2, to begin serving their sentences. On Friday, June 29, the attorneys met with all the defendants and 'advised that they all should be present (in court on Monday) and * * * (were) assured they would be.' But by Monday four had absconded. Since seven were present, however, the Order on Mandate was signed, and the seven were taken off to serve their prison terms. The court canceled the bail of the missing four on July 3 and issued a bench warrant for their arrest. Two of the four, Hall and Thompson, were apprehended in 1951 and 1953 respectively and were convicted of criminal contempt. United States v. Hall, 2 Cir., 198 F.2d 726; United States v. Thompson, 2 Cir., 214 F.2d 545. The petitioners surrendered voluntarily in 1956 and were likewise convicted of criminal contempt. The contempt charged in each instance was a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(3), 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401(3), by disobedience of the provision of the Order on Mandate, issued on the morning of July 2, 1951, requiring the surrender of all the Dennis defendants to the United States Marshal at 11:05 a.m. on that day. Significantly, at the time the judge signed the order he lined out the hour of surrender, appearing as 10:30 in the proposed order, and substituted 11:05, the time at which the order was actually signed. See the opinion of Judge Biggs in United States v. Hall, supra, 198 F.2d at page 732.\n\n\n92\nThe most that can be said is that the evidence might have been sufficient to support conviction of the petitioners for bail jumping if that had been an offense at the time they fled. But bail jumping did not become a separate crime until three years after the petitioners' flight, when this void in the law highlighted by the petitioners' conduct\u2014led the Department of Justice to secure the enactment of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3146. See H.R.Rep. No. 2104, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. But, in any event, bail jumping is not the offense charged, and, although it is certainly a most serious obstruction of the administration of justice, it is not in itself a criminal contempt.\n\n\n93\nThe Court relates the criminal contempt charged to bail jumping by its use of \u00a7 3146 as support for the sentences imposed upon the petitioners. But bail jumping under \u00a7 3146 is proved merely by evidence that the accused willfully failed to surrender within 30 days after incurring a forfeiture of his bail. Much more, however, than evidence sustaining a conviction for bail jumping is necessary to sustain convictions for the contempts here charged of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(3), 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401(3), by willful and knowing disobedience of a single provision of the Order on Mandate of July 2, 1951. The indispensable element of that offense, to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., 221 U.S. 418, 444, 31 S.Ct. 492, 499, 55 L.Ed. 797, is that the petitioners, who were not served with the order, in some other way obtained actual knowledge of its existence and command. Kelton v. United States, 3 Cir., 294 F. 491; In re Kwelman, D.C., 31 F.Supp. 23; see Wilson v. State of North Carolina, 169 U.S. 586, 18 S.Ct. 435, 42 L.Ed. 865.\n\n\n94\nAssessment of the sufficiency of the evidence bearing on the petitioners' knowledge requires that the precise time at which the order came into existence be kept clearly in mind. The Court of Appeals below fell into palpable error in reading the specifications to charge 'disobedience of the order of June 28.' 241 F.2d 631, 632. The order was not signed or entered until court convened after 10 o'clock on the morning of July 2. What happended on June 28 was tht the attorneys of the Dennis defendants were served with copies of a proposed order to be entered on July 2. But the attorneys' knowledge cannot be imputed to their clients. In re Kwelman, supra. The petitioners had absconded by July 2, and the record is completely silent as to their whereabouts from June 29 until they surrendered almost five years later. Concededly, direct evidence of knowledge by the petitioners of the order of July 2 is wholly lacking and the case for conviction rests entirely upon circumstantial evidence.\n\n\n95\nThe proof upon which reliance is placed consists of evidence (1) that the petitioners knew on June 29, 1951, that the order was to be entered on July 2, and (2) that the petitioners made certain statements to the press at the time of their surrender almost five years later.\n\n\n96\nFirst. Manifestly, foreknowledge that an order might come into existence does not prove knowledge that it did come into existence. Even if the petitioners knew on June 29 that the order was likely to be signed on July 2, the most that can be said is that after July 2 the petitioners knew that the order was to have been entered. This, of course, is not the same as knowledge that the order had been entered, and it is the latter knowledge which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Knowledge that the order had been entered, of course, could only be acquired by the petitioners after the order had come into existence on the morning of July 2; and that knowledge can hardly be inferred from the events which occurred prior to the moment the order was entered. See the opinion of Judge Biggs in United States v. Hall, 2 Cir., 198 F.2d 726, 733\u2014735.\n\n\n97\nThe Government's lack of confidence in the proofs to show actual knowledge is implicit in its effort to sustain the convictions on a theory of constructive knowledge derived from the events of June 28 and from the evidence that on June 29 the petitioners and the other Dennis defendants were told by the attorneys that they must be in court on July 2. The short answer to this contention is that the petitioners are not charged with disobedience of an order of which they had constructive knowledge but with disobedience of an order of which they had actual knowledge, and conviction can be had on the precise charge, or not at all. In any event, the sole authority relied upon by the Government is a dictum in Pettibone v. United States, 148 U.S. 197, 206\u2014207, 13 S.Ct. 542, 546, 37 L.Ed. 419, to the effect that persons may be chargeable with knowledge of an order from notice that an application will be made for the order. But whatever its utility in civil cases, theories of constructive knowledge have no place in the criminal law. Not only is this forcefully demonstrated in Judge Biggs' opinion in United States v. Hall, supra, but the Pettibone dictum has not been followed in criminal contempt cases. Kelton v. United States, supra; In re Kwelman, supra.\n\n\n98\nSecond. Since the evidence of knowledge that an order was to be entered is not sufficient to prove knowledge that the order was entered, what of the evidence of what was said by the petitioners at the time of their surrender? The Court refers to the petitioners' press releases in which they stated they would surrender to 'enter prison,' and to Green's further reference that he intended to 'go to the United States Marshal's Office.' But, of course, surrender could only have been to enter prison. Their statements prove no more than what the petitioners and everyone else knew had to happen when this Court affirmed their Smith Act convictions in 1951. And it can hardly be doubted that, after the many months these petitioners spend at their trial in the Foley Square Courthouse, both the location and function of the Marshal's Office was well known to them. That the Court must resort to these statements to find probative weight in the evidence demonstrates the inherent insufficiency of the proofs to show actual knowledge.\n\n\n99\nNor do there appear other circumstances from which knowledge may be inferred. The Court's opinion gives the impression that the surrender order was an order in familiar and customary use, well known to the sophisticated in the criminal law. I doubt that even widely experienced criminal lawyers encounter this provision very often. The provision was not the occasion for the entry of the order of July 2. The purpose of that order, as its caption 'Order on Mandate' shows, was to enter an order in the District Court to give effect to the Mandate of this Court affirming the convictions of the Dennis defendants. But for the necessity of entering an order for that purpose there may well have been no surrender order. No statute or rule of court, even a local rule of the District Court, can be pointed to as requiring inclusion of the surrender provision. The bondsman who stands to lose the posted bail, not a surrender order, is usually counted on to produce the defendant. Hearings before Subcommittee No. 4 of the House Committee on the Judiciary on H.R. 8658, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 14\u201419. This is not to say, of course, that the provision was in any way improper or illegal or served no useful purpose. Nevertheless its novelty is indicated when the Court must look to a provision of the bail bond as the only discoverable source of authority for the provision.\n\n\n100\nI can well understand why the Government should have desired to proceed against these petitioners for their serious obstruction of the administration of justice. In the absence of a statutory provision aimed directly at this conduct, the Government resorted to this attempt to punish that obstruction as a criminal contempt. However, regardless of the view taken on the underlying constitutional issue involved, the odiousness of the offense cannot be a reason for relaxing the normal standards of proof required to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 401(3). Believing that the proofs in this case fall short of that standard, I must dissent.\n\n\n101\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, though agreeing with the dissent of Mr. Justice BLACK, also agrees with Mr. Justice BRENNAN that the evidence will not sustain this conviction, whatever may be the view on the underlying constitutional issue.\n\n\n\n1\n This Rule provides that criminal contempts other than those committed in the actual presence of the court and seen or heard by the court shall be prosecuted on notice. Notice may be given, as in the present case, by an order to show cause. The Rule states that a defendant is entitled to trial by jury if an Act of Congress so provides. See note 19, infra.\n\n\n2\n The debates conducted in 1830\u20141831 by leading counsel of that period during the impeachment proceedings against Judge James H. Peck, see 356 U.S. 171, 78 S.Ct. at page 636, infra, contained discussions of the Act of 1789, and the limitations to be imposed upon it, which were cast largely in terms of the English common law preceding its enactment. See Stansbury, Report of the Trial of James H. Peck (1833).\n\n\n3\n During the debates in 1830\u20141831 referred to in note 2, supra, several of the managers who argued that Judge Peck had exceeded the historical boundaries of the contempt power by the conduct which had provoked the impeachment proceedings (see 356 U.S. 171, 78 S.Ct. at page 636, infra) appear to have assumed that courts were historically justified in employing the contempt power to deal with disobedience to court process. See Stansbury, supra, note 2, at 313, 395\u2014396, 436, 444.\n\n\n4\n See, e.g., In re Michael, 326 U.S. 224, 66 S.Ct. 78, 90 L.Ed. 30; Nye v. United States, 313 U.S. 33, 61 S.Ct. 810, 85 L.Ed. 1172, and Ex parte Hudgings, 249 U.S. 378, 39 S.Ct. 337, 63 L.Ed. 656, all concerning the predecessor statutes to present \u00a7 401(1), which relates to misbehavior in court or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice, and Cammer v. United States, 350 U.S. 399, 76 S.Ct. 456, 100 L.Ed. 474, arising under \u00a7 401(2), which deals with misbehavior of court officers in their official transactions.\n\n\n5\n This order can hardly be interpreted otherwise than as imposing on the Dennis defendants from the time that the order became effective on July 2 a continuing obligation to surrender promptly upon becoming aware of its effectiveness. The printed record before us indicates that the proposed order given counsel on June 28 read precisely in the form quoted in the text above, but the original copy of the order reveals that the time for surrender was first written as '10:30' a.m., and at some later time prior to the time the order was signed was changed to read '11.05.' Petitioners make no issue of this discrepancy, and we attach no significance to it.\n\n\n6\n The events of June 29, 1951, were testified to in court on July 3, 1951, by petitioners' counsel, Messrs. Sacher and Isserman. By stipulation, a transcript of this testimony was introduced into evidence during the contempt proceedings in the District Court, and excerpts from the testimony follow:\nThe Court: 'Now, you did make a statement last week that you will have the four defendants (Green, Winston, Hall and Thompson) in court, as I recall, on Monday (July 2).\n'Mr. Sacher: I said that all of them would be here.\n'The Court: And as you know, four of them were not here on Monday. Of course, you may be bound by some obligation of attorney and client, but are you able to give the Court any information as to their present whereabouts?\n'Mr. Sacher: Your Honor, I should consider myself not bound by any obligation to withhold any information that I might have, and I give your Honor my assurance that I have no knowledge, I have no basis of knowledge as to their present whereabouts or where they might have gone.\n'The Court: Where did you last see these four defendants?\n'Mr. Sacher: * * * I am not certain about Thompson, but I am fairly certain that I saw the three I mentioned sometime on Friday (June 29) at 35 East Twelfth Street.\n'The Court: Did you tell them at that time that their presence was required in court yesterday morning?\n'Mr. Sacher: Definitely. As a matter of fact I advised that because I think I saw them among other defendants after I had been here on Friday, your Honor, and had made these motions (appearently referring to counsel's efforts to postpone the surrender date until after July 4), and therefore I advised that they all should be present and I was assured they would be.\n'The Court: Mr. Isserman, do you know where any of these defendants are?\n'Mr. Isserman: I might say to the Court that I would not rest on privilege in this situation at all. I have no knowledge of the present whereabouts of any of these defendants. * * * I remember, Green being my client, I remember distinctly that I saw him on that day (June 29) and received from him the assurance that he would be here Monday morning (July 2).'\n\n\n7\n Excerpts from Green's press release:\n'On Monday, February 27th at 12 noon I shall cease being a fugitive from injustice and instead become its prisoner. At that time, I shall appear at Foley Square. * * * The course I chose five years ago was not dictated by personal considerations. In many ways it was harsher than that of imprisonment * * *. (I)t seemed incumbent upon me to resist that trend (i.e. to 'an American brand of fascism') with every ounce of strength I possessed. Some could do so by going to jail; others by not. * * * I enter prison with head high and conscience clear.' (Italics added.)\nExcerpts from Winston's press release:\n'Reiterating my innocence, and protesting the flagrant miscarriage of justice in my case, I now enter prison * * *. I shall appear this coming Monday, March 5th 12:30 p.m., at the U.S. Marshal's Office in Foley Square.' (Italics added.)\n\n\n8\n The substance of \u00a7\u00a7 21 and 22 was that one charged with the commission of acts constituting willful disobedience to a lawful court order could demand a trial by jury if (\u00a7 21) '* * * the act or thing so done by him be of such character as to constitute also a criminal offense under any statute of the United States or under the laws of any State in which the act was committed * * *.' Section 22 provided that the jury trial '* * * shall conform, as near as may be, to the practice in criminal cases prosecuted by indictment or upon information.'\n\n\n9\n This section excluded from the Act, inter alia, contempts committed by disobedience to any court order entered in any suit or action '* * * brought or prosecuted in the name of, or on behalf of, the United States * * *.'\n\n\n10\n At the present time, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 402, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402, contains the definitional provision formerly in \u00a7 21 of the Clayton Act and expressly refers to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3691, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3691, which provides that contempts falling within this definition are subject to trial by jury.\n\n\n11\n Petitioners have shown us no federal decision which intimates any constitutional or common-law restriction on the power of federal courts to sentence for over one year. As stated by the Court of Appeals in the present case, 241 F.2d at page 634, '* * * there is not in the books a syllable of recognition of any such supposed limitation.'

III, \u00a7 2, or the Sixth Amendment: Ex parte Savin, 131 U.S. 267, 278, 9 S.Ct. 699, 702, 33 L.Ed. 150; Eilenbecker v.

Although the statements contained in these cases, with few exceptions, are broadly phrased and do not refer to particular categories of criminal contempts, several of the cases involved review of contempt convictions arising out of disobedience to court orders. See in particular In re Debs, Gompers v. United States, and United States v. United Mine Workers.\nFor more general statements of the nature of the contempt power and its indispensability to federal courts, see United States v.

United States, 267 U.S. 517, 537, 45 S.Ct. 390, 395, 69 L.Ed. 767 (compulsory process and assistance of counsel); Gompers v.

However, Fox's major effort was to show that a statement in an unpublished opinion by Wilmot, J., in The King v. Almon (1765), to the effect that summary punishment for contempts committed out of court stood upon 'immemorial usage,' was based on an erroneous interpretation of earlier law as applied to the case before him, namely, contempt by libel on the\ncourt by a stranger to court proceedings. See Fox, The King v. Almon (Parts I and II), 24 L.Q.Rev. 184, 266; Fox, The History of Contempt of Court (1927), 5\u201443. That contempts committed in the view of the court were at an early date dealt with summarily is not disputed by Fox. The History of Contempt of Court, supra, at 50. Insofar as Fox discusses contempts out of court by disobedience to court orders, it is not clear whether the author contends that such contempts were tried at early English law under summary procedures only for civil coercive purposes, or for criminal, punitive purposes as well. Cf. The King v. Almon, supra, at 188, 277\u2014278; and Fox, The Summary Process to Punish Contempt (Parts I and II), 25 L.Q.Rev. 238, 354, with The King v. Almon, at 195, 276; The Summary Process to Punish Contempt, at 249; and The History of Contempt of Court, supra, at 108\u2014110. See also Beale, Contempt of Court, 21 Harv.L.Rev. 161, 164, 169\u2014171. Fox concludes that by the mid-Seventeenth or early Eighteenth Century, a variety of contempts committed outside of court were subject to punishment by the exercise of a court's summary jurisdiction. The Summary Process to Punish Contempts, supra, at 252, 366, 370\u2014371. It appears that under present English law disobedience to court process is but one of the many categories of contempts of court which are dealt with summarily. 8 Halsbury, Laws of England (3d ed. 1954), 3\u20144, 25\u201426; 1 Russell, Crime (10th ed. 1950), 329\u2014330.\n\n\n19\n See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 402, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402, supra, note 10; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3692, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3692 (jury trial for contempts based on violation of injunctions in cases involving labor disputes); \u00a7 151, 71 Stat. 638, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1995, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1995 (right to jury trial under provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1957 in limited circumstances in cases of criminal contempts).\n\n\n20\n This holding makes unnecessary consideration of petitioners' argument based on Rule 7 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which falls with their constitutional argument. Rule 7 refers to criminal offenses, that is 'crimes' in the constitutional sense. Criminal contempts are governed by Rule 42.\n\n\n1\n Oliver Ellsworth, Chairman, William Paterson, Caleb Strong, Richard Bassett, William Few. 1 Annals of Cong. 17.\n\n\n2\n Ex parte Kearney, 7 Wheat. 38, 5 L.Ed. 391; In re Chiles, 22 Wall. 157, 22 L.Ed. 819; Ex parte Terry, 128 U.S. 289, 9 S.Ct. 77, 32 L.Ed. 405; In re Savin, 131 U.S. 267, 9 S.Ct. 699, 33 L.Ed. 150; In re Cuddy, 131 U.S. 280, 9 S.Ct. 703, 33 L.Ed. 154; In re Swan, 150 U.S. 637, 14 S.Ct. 225, 37 L.Ed. 1207; In re Debs, 158 U.S. 564, 15 S.Ct. 900, 39 L.Ed. 1092; Brown v.

The first of the studies of criminal contempt by Sir John Charles Fox, The King v. Almon, 24 Law Q.Rev. 184, appeared in 1908, and tthe results of the search of Solly-Flood were published as early as 1886. The Story of Prince Henry of Monmouth and Chief-Justice Gascoign, 3 Transactions of the Royal Historical Society (N.S.) 47. Mr. Justice Holmes, writing for the Court in Gompers v. United States, 1914, 233 U.S. 604, 34 S.Ct. 693, 58 L.Ed. 1115, noted the work of Solly-Flood. He observed that: 'It does not follow that contempts of the class under consideration are not crimes, or rather, in the language of the statute, offenses, because trial by jury as it has been gradually worked out and fought out has been thought not to extend to them as a matter of constitutional right. These contempts are infractions of the law, visited with punishment as such. If such acts are not criminal, we are in error as to the most fundamental characteristic of crimes as that word has been understood in English speech. So truly are they crimes that it seems to be proved that in the early law they were punished only by the usual criminal procedure, 3 Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, N.S. p. 147 (1885), and that, as least in England, it seems that they still may be and preferably are tried in that way.' 233 U.S. at pages 610\u2014611, 34 S.Ct. at page 695.\n\n\n3\n Beginning with Ex parte Robinson, 19 Wall. 505, 22 L.Ed. 205, and In re Chiles, 22 Wall. 157, 22 L.Ed. 819, this list includes every Justice who sat on the Court since 1874, with the exception of Mr. Justice Woods (1881-1887), and Mr. Justice Byrnes (1941-1942).\n\n\n4\n 'We do not write on a blank sheet. The Court has its jurisprudence, the helpful repository of the deliberate and expressed convictions of generations of sincere minds addressing themselves to exposition and decision, not with the freedom of casual critics or even of studious commentators, but under the pressure and within the limits of a definite official responsibility.' Chief Justice Hughes speaking on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Court. 309 U.S. XIV, 60 S.Ct. LIII.\n\n\n1\n The term 'summary proceeding' (or 'summary trial') is used in its ordinary sense to refer to a 'form of trial in which the ancient established course of legal proceedings is disregarded, especially in the matter of trial by jury, and, in the case of the heavier crimes, presentment by a grand jury.' 3 Bouv.Law Dict., Rawle's Third Revision, p. 3182. Of course as the law now stands contempts committed in the presence of the judge may be punished without any hearing or trial at all, summary or otherwise. For a flagrant example see Sacher v. United States, 343 U.S. 1, 72 S.Ct. 451, 96 L.Ed. 717.\n\n\n2\n State ex rel. Ashbaugh v. Circuit Court, 97 Wis. 1, 8, 72 N.W. 193, 194\u2014195, 38 L.R.A. 554.\n\n\n3\n The precedents are adequately collected in note 14 of the Court's opinion.\nMuch of what is said in this opinion is equally applicable to contempts committed in the presence of the court. My opposition to summary punishment for those contempts was fully set forth in my dissent in Sacher v. United States, 343 U.S. 1, 14, 72 S.Ct. 451, 457, 96 L.Ed. 717.\n\n\n4\n 'I * * * am quite willing that it be regarded hereafter as the law of this court, that its opinion upon the construction of the Constitution is always open to discussion when it is supposed to have been founded in error, and that its judicial authority should hereafter depend altogether on the force of the reasoning by which it is supported.' Chief Justice Taney, Passenger Cases (Smith v. Turner), 7 How. 283, 470, 12 L.Ed. 702 (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n5\n Frankfurter and Landis, Power to Regulate Contempts, 37 Harv.L.Rev. 1010, 1011.\nIt also seems significant that the initial decisions by this Court actually upholding the power of the federal courts to punish contempts by summary process were not made until as late as the final decades of the last century, almost a full century after the adoption of the Constitution. Since that time the power has been vigorously challenged on a number of occasions. See, e.g., Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, 247 U.S. 402, 425, 38 S.Ct. 560, 566, 62 L.Ed. 1186 (dissenting opinion); Sacher v. United States, 343 U.S. 1, 14, 72 S.Ct. 451, 457, 96 L.Ed. 717 (dissenting opinion). Within the past few years there has been a tendency on the part of this Court to restrict the substantive scope of the contempt power to narrower bounds than had been formerly thought to exist. See, e.g., Nye v. United States, 313 U.S. 33, 61 S.Ct. 810, 85 L.Ed. 1172; Bridges v. State of California, 314 U.S. 252, 62 S.Ct. 190, 86 L.Ed. 192; In re Michael, 326 U.S. 224, 66 S.Ct. 78, 90 L.Ed. 30; Cammer v. United States, 350 U.S. 399, 76 S.Ct. 456, 100 L.Ed. 474. Cf. In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 68 S.Ct. 499, 92 L.Ed. 682. In substantial part this is attributable to a deeply felt antipathy toward the arbitrary procedures now used to punish contempts.\n\n\n6\n Perhaps the classic example is the much criticized decision in In re Debs, 158 U.S. 564, 15 S.Ct. 900, 39 L.Ed. 1092. For some of the milder comment see Lewis, A Protest Against Administering Criminal Law by Injunction\u2014The Debs Case, 42 Am.L.Reg. 879; Lewis, Strikes and Courts of Equity, 46 Am.L.Reg. 1; Dunbar, Government by Injunction, 13 L.Q.Rev. 347; Gregory, Government by Injunction, 11 Harv.L.Rev. 487.\n\n\n7\n E.g., see Beauharnais v. People of State of Illinois, 343 U.S. 250, 72 S.Ct. 725, 96 L.Ed. 919; Perez v. Brownell, 356 U.S. 44, 78 S.Ct. 568.\n\n\n8\n A series of recent cases in this Court alone indicates that the personal emotions or opinions of judges often become deeply involved in the punishment of an alleged contempt. See, e.g., Fisher v. Pace, 336 U.S. 155, 69 S.Ct. 425, 93 L.Ed. 569; Sacher v. United States, 343 U.S. 1, 72 S.Ct. 451, 96 L.Ed. 717; Offutt v. United States, 348 U.S. 11, 75 S.Ct. 11, 99 L.Ed. 11; Nilva v. United States, 352 U.S. 385, 77 S.Ct. 431, 1 L.Ed.2d 415; Yates v. United States, 355 U.S. 66, 78 S.Ct. 128, 2 L.Ed.2d 95.\n\n\n9\n Oswald, Contempt of Court (3d ed. 1911), 6.\n\n\n10\n See 356 U.S. 202\u2014213, 78 S.Ct. at pages 653 to 658, infra.\n\n\n11\n In accordance with established usage 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1, defines a felony as any 'offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.' By this standard the offense of contempt is not only a crime, but a felony\u2014a crime of the gravest and most serious kind.\nOf course if the maximum punishment for criminal contempt were sufficiently limited that offense might no longer fall within the category of 'crimes'; instead it might then be regarded, in the light of our previous decisions, as a 'petty' or 'minor' offense for which the defendant would not necessarily be entitled to trial by jury. See District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U.S. 617, 57 S.Ct. 660, 81 L.Ed. 843; Callan v. Wilson, 127 U.S. 540, 8 S.Ct. 1301, 32 L.Ed. 223.\n\n\n12\n City of New Orleans v. The Steamship Co., 20 Wall. 387, 392, 22 L.Ed. 354 ('Contempt of court is a specific criminal offence.'). And see Michaelson v. United States ex rel. Chicago, St. P., M. & O.R. Co., 266 U.S. 42, 66\u201467, 45 S.Ct. 18, 20, 69 L.Ed. 162; Pendergast v. United States, 317 U.S. 412, 417\u2014418, 63 S.Ct. 268, 270, 87 L.Ed. 368.\n'Since a charge of criminal contempt is essentially an accusation of crime, all the constitutional safeguards available to an accused in a criminal trial should be extended to prosecutions for such contempt.' Frankfurter and Greene, The Labor Injunction, 226.\n\n\n13\n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3146.\n\n\n14\n One scholar has argued that even contempts in the face of the courts were tried by jury after indictment by grand jury until the reign of Elizabeth I. Solly-Flood, Prince Henry of Monmouth and Chief Justice Gascoign, 3 Transactions of the Royal Historical Society (N.S.) 47. Although agreeing that contempts in facie were often tried by a jury up to and beyond this period, Fox takes the view that such contempts, were also punishable by summary procedures from the early common law.\n\n\n15\n In passing it is interesting to note that even Wilmot felt obliged to bolster his position by pointing to the fact that a defendant, under a notion then prevalent, could exonerate himself from a charge of contempt by fully denying the charges under oath. In this event he could only be prosecuted for false swearing in which case he was entitled, as Wilmot elaborately observes, to trial by jury.

Thompson, 2 Cir., 214 F.2d 545; United States v. Hall, 2 Cir., 198 F.2d 726.\n\n\n21\n Although records of the colonial era are extremely fragmentary and inaccessible apparently such contempts as existed were not the subject of major punishment in that period. From the scattered reported cases it appears that alleged offenders were let off after an apology, a reprimand or a small fine or other relatively slight punishment. I have found no instance where anyone was unconditionally imprisoned for even a term of months, let alone years, during that ear when extremely harsh penalties were otherwise commonplace.\n\n\n22\n The following are merely random samples of important and far-reaching federal regulatory Acts now in effect under which a violation of any provision of the Act is not only a statutory crime punishable as such but also may be enjoined at the Government's request and punished as a criminal contempt by summary process if the injunction is disobeyed.

Ex parte Savin, 131 U.S. 267, 275, 9 S.Ct. 699, 701, 33 L.Ed. 150. Section 17, which contains a number of other provisions, appears to have been a comparatively insignificant provision of the judicial code enacted by the Congress without material discussion in the midst of 34 other sections, many of which were both extremely important and highly controversial.\n\n\n26\n See, e.g., 4 Blackstone's Commentaries 1\u20146, 119\u2014126, 280 287. Also pertinent here is Blackstone's oft-quoted laudation of trial by jury 'as the glory of the English law. . . . (I)t is the most transcendent privilege which any subject can enjoy, or wish for, that he cannot be affected either in his property, his liberty, or his person, but by the unanimous consent of twelve of his neighbours and equals.' 3 id., at 379.\n\n\n27\n See, e.g., 1 Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown (6th ed. 1787), 87.\n\n\n28\n Baldwin, The American Judiciary, 14.\n'After the Revolution the public was extremely hostile to England and to all that was English and it was impossible for the common law to escape the odium of its English origin.'

And See Warren, History of the American Bar, 224\u2014228.\n\n\n29\n In 1804 the Chief Justice and two Associate Justices of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court were actually impeached for sentencing a person to jail for contempt. In part the impeachment rested on the feeling that punishment of contempt by summary process was an arbitrary practice of the common law unsuited to this country. While the Justices were narrowly acquitted this apparently only aggravated popular antagonism toward the contempt power.

Here the defendants surrendered several years after they had been ordered to appear and serve their sentences. There was no reason for urgent action to punish them for their absence, there was ample time to impanel a jury and prosecute them in the regular manner. As a matter of fact almost a month and a half did elapse between their surrender and trial.\nAlleged contempts committed beyond the court's presence where the judge has no personal knowledge of the material facts are especially suited for trial by jury. A hearing must be held, witnesses must be called, and evidence taken in any event. Cf. Cooke v. United States, 267 U.S. 517, 45 S.Ct. 390, 69 L.Ed. 767. And often, as in this case, crucial facts are in close dispute.\nI might add, at this point, that MR.

{"text":"450 U.S. 785\n101 S.Ct. 1468\n67 L.Ed.2d 685\nRichard SCHWEIKER, Secretary of Health and Human Servicesv.Ann HANSEN.\nNo. 80-1162.\nApril 6, 1981.\nRehearing Denied May 26, 1981.\n\nSee 451 U.S. 1032, 101 S.Ct. 3023.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nOn June 12, 1974, respondent met for about 15 minutes with Don Connelly, a field representative of the Social Security Administration (SSA), and orally inquired of him whether she was eligible for \"mother's insurance benefits\" under \u00a7 202(g) of the Social Security Act (Act), 64 Stat. 485, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(g).  Connelly erroneously told her that she was not, and she left the SSA office without having filed a written application. By the Act's terms, such benefits are available only to one who, among other qualifications, \"has filed application.\"  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(g)(1)(D).  By a regulation promulgated pursuant to the Act, only written applications satisfy the \"filed application\" requirement.  20 CFR \u00a7 404.601 (1974).1  The SSA's Claims Manual, and internal Administration handbook, instructs field representatives to advise applicants of the advantages of filing written applications and to recommend to applicants who are uncertain about their eligibility that they file written applications.  Connelly, however, did not recommend to respondent that she file a written application;  nor did he advise her of the advantages of doing so.  The question is whether Connelly's erroneous statement and neglect of the Claims Manual estop petitioner, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, from denying retroactive benefits to respondent for a period in which she was eligible for benefits but had not filed a written application.\n\n\n2\nRespondent eventually filed a written application after learning in May 1975 that in fact she was eligible.  She then began receiving benefits.  Pursuant to \u00a7 202(j)(1) of the Act,2 she also received retroactive benefits for the preceding 12 months, which was the maximum retroactive benefit allowed by the Act.  Respondent contended, however, that she should receive retroactive benefits for the 12 months preceding her June 1974 interview with Connelly.  An Administrative Law Judge rejected this claim, concluding that Connelly's erroneous statement and neglect of the Claims Manual did not estop petitioner from determining respondent's eligibility for benefits only as of the date of respondent's written application.  The Social Security Appeals Council affirmed.\n\n\n3\nRespondent then brought this lawsuit in the District Court for the District of Vermont,3 which held that the written-application requirement was \"unreasonably restrictive\" as applied to the facts of this case.  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.  619 F.2d 942 (1980). It agreed with petitioner as an initial matter that the regulation requiring a written application is valid and that the Claims Manual has no legally binding effect.  But it considered the written-application requirement a mere \"procedural requirement\" of lesser import than the fact that respondent in June 1974 had been \"substantively eligible\" for the benefits.  Id., at 948.  In such circumstances, the majority held, \"misinformation provided by a Government official combined with a showing of misconduct (even if it does not rise to the level of a violation of a legally binding rule) should be sufficient to require estoppel.\"  Ibid.  In summarizing its holding, the majority stated that the Government may be estopped \"where (a) a procedural not a substantive requirement is involved and (b) an internal procedural manual or guide or some other source of objective standards of conduct exists and supports an inference of misconduct by a Government employee.\"  Id., at 949.\n\n\n4\nJudge Friendly dissented.  He argued that the majority's conclusion is irreconcilable with decisions of this Court, e. g., Federal Crop Insurance Corp. v. Merrill, 332 U.S. 380, 68 S.Ct. 1, 92 L.Ed. 10 (1947);  Montana v. Kennedy, 366 U.S. 308, 81 S.Ct. 1336, 6 L.Ed.2d 313 (1961);  INS v. Hibi, 414 U.S. 5, 94 S.Ct. 19, 38 L.Ed.2d 7 (1973) (per curiam ), and with decisions of other Courts of Appeals, Leimbach v. Califano, 596 F.2d 300 (CA8 1979); Cheers v. Secretary of HEW, 610 F.2d 463 (CA7 1979).\n\n\n5\nWe agree with the dissent.  This Court has never decided what type of conduct by a Government employee will estop the Government from insisting upon compliance with valid regulations governing the distribution of welfare benefits.  In two cases involving denial of citizenship, the Court has declined to decide whether even \"affirmative misconduct\" would estop the Government from denying citizenship, for in neither case was \"affirmative misconduct\" involved.  INS v. Hibi, supra, at 8-9, 94 S.Ct., at 21-22;  Montana v. Kennedy, supra, at 314-315, 81 S.Ct., at 1340-1341.  The Court has recognized, however, \"the duty of all courts to observe the conditions defined by Congress for charging the public treasury.\"  Federal Crop Insurance Corp. v. Merrill, supra, at 385, 68 S.Ct., at 3.  Lower federal courts have recognized that duty also, and consistently have relied on Merrill in refusing to estop the Government where an eligible applicant has lost Social Security benefits because of possibly erroneous replies to oral inquiries.  See Leimbach v. Califano, supra, at 304-305;  Cheers v. Secretary of HEW, supra, at 468-469;  Goldberg v. Weinberger, 546 F.2d 477, 481 (CA2 1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 937, 97 S.Ct. 2648, 53 L.Ed.2d 255 (1977);  Simon v. Califano, 593 F.2d 121, 123 (CA9 1979);  Parker v. Finch, 327 F.Supp. 193, 195 (ND Ga. 1971);  Flamm v. Ribicoff, 203 F.Supp. 507, 510 (SDNY 1961).  This is another in that line of cases,4 for we are convinced that Connelly's conduct\u2014which the majority conceded to be less than \"affirmative misconduct,\" 619 F.2d, at 948\u2014does not justify the abnegation of that duty.\n\n\n6\nConnelly erred in telling respondent that she was ineligible for the benefit she sought.  It may be that Connelly erred because he was unfamiliar with a recent amendment which afforded benefits to respondent.  Id., at 947.  Or it may be that respondent gave Connelly too little information for him to know that he was in error.  Id., at 955 (Friendly, J., dissenting).  But at worst, Connelly's conduct did not cause respondent to take action, cf. Federal Crop Insurance Corp. v. Merrill, supra, or fail to take action, cf. Montana v. Kennedy, supra, that respondent could not correct at any time.\n\n\n7\nSimilarly, there is no doubt that Connelly failed to follow the Claims Manual in neglecting to recommend that respondent file a written application and in neglecting to advise her of the advantages of a written application.  But the Claims Manual is not a regulation.  It has no legal force, and it does not bind the SSA.  Rather, it is a 13-volume handbook for internal use by thousands of SSA employees, including the hundreds of employees who receive untold numbers of oral inquiries like respondent's each year.  If Connelly's minor breach of such a manual suffices to estop petitioner, then the Government is put \"at risk that every alleged failure by an agent to follow instructions to the last detail in one of a thousand cases will deprive it of the benefit of the written application requirement which experience has taught to be essential to the honest and effective administration of the Social Security Laws.\"  619 F.2d, at 956 (Friendly, J., dissenting).  See United States v. Caceres, 440 U.S. 741, 755-756, 99 S.Ct. 1465, 1473-1474, 59 L.Ed.2d 733 (1979).5\n\n\n8\nFinally, the majority's distinction between respondent's \"substantiv[e] eligib[ility]\" and her failure to satisfy a \"procedural requirement\" does not justify estopping petitioner in this case.  Congress expressly provided in the Act that only one who \"has filed application\" for benefits may receive them, and it delegated to petitioner the task of providing by regulation the requisite manner of application.  A court is no more authorized to overlook the valid regulation requiring that applications be in writing than it is to overlook any other valid requirement for the receipt of benefits.\n\n\n9\nIn sum, Connelly's errors \"fal[l] far short\" of conduct which would raise a serious question whether petitioner is estopped from insisting upon compliance with the valid regulation.  Montana v. Kennedy, supra, at 314, 81 S.Ct., at 1340.  Accordingly, we grant the motion of respondent for leave to proceed in- forma pauperis and the petition for certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n10\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n11\nJustice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN, joins, dissenting.\n\n\n12\nA summary reversal is a rare disposition, usually reserved by this Court for situations in which the law is settled and stable, the facts are not in dispute, and the decision below is clearly in error.  Because this is not such a case, I dissent from the majority's summary reversal of the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and would instead grant the petition and set the case for plenary consideration.\n\n\n13\nThe issue here is important, not only in economic terms to respondent Hansen, but in constitutional terms as well.  The question of when the Government may be equitably estopped has divided the distinguished panel of the Court of Appeals in this case, has received inconsistent treatment from other Courts of Appeals, and has been the subject of considerable ferment.  See, e. g., Corniel-Rodriquez v. INS, 532 F.2d 301 (CA2 1976);  United States v. Lazy FC Ranch, 481 F.2d 985 (CA9 1973);  United States v. Fox Lake State Bank, 366 F.2d 962 (CA7 1966);  Walsonavich v. United States, 335 F.2d 96 (CA3 1964);  Simmons v. United States, 308 F.2d 938 (CA5 1962);  Semaan v. Mumford, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 282, 335 F.2d 704 (1964);  Eichelberger v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 88 F.2d 874 (CA5 1937).  See generally K. Davis, Administrative Law of the Seventies \u00a7 17.01 (1976);  Note, Equitable Estoppel of the Government, 79 Colum.L.Rev. 551 (1979). Indeed, the majority today recognizes that \"[t]his Court has never decided what type of conduct by a Government employee will estop the Government from insisting upon compliance with valid regulations governing the distribution of welfare benefits.\" Ante, at 788. The majority goes on to suggest that estoppel may be justified in some circumstances.  Yet rather than address the issue in a comprehensive fashion, the Court simply concludes that this is not such a case.1  The apparent message of today's decision\u2014that we will know an estoppel when we see one\u2014provides inadequate guidance to the lower courts in an area of the law that, contrary to the majority's view, is far from settled.\n\n\n14\nIndeed, the majority's attempt to distinguish conflicting decisions of other courts itself demonstrates the impropriety of today's summary disposition.  The majority declines to \"consider the correctness of these cases\" and instead simply notes that they are distinguishable on their facts from the present case.  Ante, at 789, n. 4.  Yet the majority fails to explain why or how these purported factual distinctions affect the legal question of when the Government may be equitably estopped.  Thus, the lower courts are left guessing whether the factual differences cited by the majority are of any real consequence.  For example, the majority distinguishes Semaan v. Mumford, supra, on the ground that \"estoppel did not threaten the public fisc.\"  Ante, at 789, n. 4. Even accepting this characterization as correct,2 I am unable to discern from the majority's opinion why the rules governing estoppel should differ depending on whether the party asserting an estoppel seeks monetary benefits from the Government instead of some other form of Governmental action or inaction. Similarly, the majority distinguishes United States v. Fox Lake State Bank, supra, on the ground it involved a claim of estoppel by \"a bank [that] had erred in certain applications because it had to file before the Government would provide it with necessary information.\"  Ante, at 789, n. 4.  I trust that the majority does not intend to suggest that a claim of estoppel is more likely to prevail when raised by a bank rather than by a person eligible for Social Security benefits, but I do not believe that the majority's other basis for distinguishing that case\u2014that the Government failed to provide the information necessary to file correct applications\u2014is substantively different from the Government's failure in this case to supply respondent with correct information when she sought to apply for benefits.  The third distinction offered by the majority\u2014one that apparently differentiates between written statements by the Government and oral ones\u2014might be relevant to the proof of the Government's conduct in some cases. However, estoppel against the Government has not been restricted in the past to written misrepresentations, see, e. g., Simmons v. United States, supra, and today's decision leaves unclear whether or when such a limitation will apply in the future.  Thus, I believe that the majority, in its haste to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, has simply added confusion to an already unsettled area by hinting, but not deciding, that various factual nuances may be dispositive of estoppel claims against the Government.\n\n\n15\nMoreover, in summarily reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals, the majority glosses over the sorts of situations\u2014such as that presented by this case\u2014that have increasingly led courts to conclude that in some cases hard and fast rules against estoppel of the Government are neither fair nor constitutionally required. The majority characterizes Connelly's conduct in this case as little more than an innocent mistake, based possibly on his unfamiliarity with a \"recent amendment\" rendering respondent eligible for benefits, or possibly, the majority speculates, on respondent's failure to give Connelly sufficient \"information . . . to know that he was in error.\"  Ante, at 789. The majority further concludes that this error was essentially harmless, because, in the majority's view, it \"did not cause respondent to . . . fail to take action . . . that respondent could not correct at any time.\"  Ibid.\n\n\n16\nWhile these characterizations certainly facilitate the summary disposition the majority seeks, they do not fit this case. The \"recent amendment\" had been in effect for a year and a half when respondent was incorrectly informed that she was not eligible.  Moreover, it is quite clear that respondent provided Connelly with sufficient information on which to make a correct judgment, had he been so inclined.3  Finally, to conclude that Connelly's incorrect assessment of respondent's eligibility did not cause her to act to her detriment in a manner that she \"could not correct at any time\" is to blink in the face of the obvious. Connelly, and not respondent, had the legal duty to meet with Social Security applicants and advise them concerning their eligibility for benefits.  While not necessarily free of error, such preliminary advice is inevitably accorded great weight by applicants who\u2014like respondent\u2014are totally uneducated in the intricacies of the Social Security laws.  Hence, the majority's effort to cast respondent as the architect of her own predicament is wholly unpersuasive.  Instead, the fault for respondent's failure to file a timely application for benefits that she was entitled to must rest squarely with the Government, first, because its agent incorrectly advised her that she was ineligible for benefits, and, second, because the same agent breached his duty to encourage to file a written application regardless of his views on her eligibility.\n\n\n17\nIn my view, when this sort of governmental misconduct directly causes an individual's failure to comply with a purely procedural requirement established by the agency, it may be sufficient to estop the Government from denying that individual benefits that she is substantively entitled to receive.  Indeed, in an analogous situation, we concluded that before an agency \"may extinguish the entitlement of . . . otherwise eligible beneficiaries, it must comply, at a minimum, with its own internal procedures.\"  Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 235, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 1074, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974). At the very least, the question deserves more than the casual treatment it receives from the majority today.\n\n\n\n1\n This regulation has been recodified and now appears at 20 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 404.602-404.614 (1980).\n\n\n2\n This section provides, in pertinent part:\n\"An individual who would have been entitled to a benefit under subsectio[n] . . . (g) . . . of this section for any month after August 1950 had he filed application therefor prior to the end of such month shall be entitled to such benefit for such month if he files application therefor prior to the end of the twelfth month immediately succeeding such month. . . .\"  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(j)(1).\n\n\n3\n Judicial review of final decisions by the Secretary is authorized by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).\n\n\n4\n Justice Marshall cites several cases in which federal courts have applied estoppel against the Government.  Post, at 791. In some of the cases, the Government had entered into written agreements which supported the claim of estoppel.  E. g., United States v. Lazy FC Ranch, 481 F.2d 985, 990 (CA9 1973); Walsonavich v. United States, 335 F.2d 96, 100-101 (CA3 1964). In others, estoppel did not threaten the public fisc as estoppel does here.  E. g., Semaan v. Mumford, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 282, 284, and n. 6, 335 F.2d 704, 706, and n. 6 (1964).  In another, a bank claiming estoppel had erred in certain applications because it had to file before the Government would provide it with necessary information.   United States v. Fox Lake State Bank, 366 F.2d 962 (CA7 1966).  We need not consider the correctness of these cases. We do think that they are easily distinguishable from the type of situation presented in this case and the line of cases we rely upon above.\n\n\n5\n The contention was made in Caceres that a violation of an internal IRS regulation concerning electronic eavesdropping should result in exclusion from trial of the evidence obtained by such eavesdropping.  In rejecting this contention, we noted that such a per se rule \"would take away from the Executive Department the primary responsibility for fashioning the appropriate remedy for the violation of its regulations.  But since the content, and indeed the existence, of the regulations would remain within the Executive's sole authority, the result might well be fewer and less protective regulations.  In the long run, it is far better to have rules like those contained in the IRS Manual, and to tolerate occasional erroneous administration of the kind displayed by this record, than either to have no rules except those mandated by statute, or to have them framed in a mere precatory form.\" 440 U.S., at 755-756, 99 S.Ct., at 1473-1474.\n\n\n1\n Ironically, the central case relied on by the majority today, INS v. Hibi, 414 U.S. 5, 94 S.Ct. 19, 38 L.Ed.2d 7 (1973), was also a per curiam decision rendered without the benefit of briefing and oral argument.  Moreover, in that case the applicant applied for the sought-after benefit\u2014naturalization\u201420 years after his substantive eligibility had expired, and the claim of estoppel arose solely from an alleged general failure of the Government to adequately inform noncitizens who served with the Armed Services of the United States during World War II of their possible eligibility for naturalization.  Here, in contrast, respondent was eligible for the benefits at the time of her interview with Connelly and the claim of estoppel here arises from Connelly's specific failures to answer correctly her questions concerning eligibility and to encourage her to file an application.\n\n\n2\n In Semaan, the benefit ultimately sought by the party claiming estoppel was reinstatement in the job from which he was discharged.  Thus, I believe that the majority errs in claiming that the estoppel \"did not threaten the public fisc.\"  Ante, at 789, n. 4.\n\n\n3\n The apparent basis for the majority's speculation that respondent may not have informed Connelly of all the relevant facts is Judge Friendly's assertion, in dissent, that Connelly did not know that respondent's husband had died.  This view is wholly implausible.  Respondent asked Connelly whether she was eligible for mother's insurance benefits.  These benefits are only available to persons whose spouses have died, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(g), a fact that must have been known to Connelly.  It is clear from the record that Connelly assumed that respondent's husband had died, and instead focused his questions on respondent's marital status at the time of her husband's death, in the mistaken belief that she would be ineligible if she was divorced at that time. Thus, respondent testified before the Administrative Law Judge that Connelly \"said I was not [eligible] because I was divorced at the time of my husband's death.\"  App. to Brief in Opposition 2a.

Neuhard, Detroit, Mich., for respondent.\nMr. Justice POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nA writ of certiorari was granted in this case, 409 U.S. 911, 93 S.Ct. 214, 34 L.Ed.2d 172 (1972), to decide whether the due process holding of North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 723 726, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2079\u20142081, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), is to be given retroactive effect. For the reasons that follow we hold today that this decision is nonretroactive.\n\n\n2\n* Respondent, Leroy Payne, pleaded guilty in a county circuit court in Michigan to a charge of assault with intent to commit murder in connection with an armed attack upon two sheriff's deputies. In March 1963 he was sentenced to a prison term of from 19 to 40 years. Several years later, respondent's conviction and sentence were set aside when a hearing, ordered by the Michigan Court of Appeals, disclosed that his confession and subsequent guilty plea were involuntary. Following a retrial, at which he exercised his rights to trial by jury and to plead innocent, respondent again was found guilty on the same assault charge. On August 30, 1967, he was resentenced to prison from 25 to 50 years with full credit for all time served under the prior sentence. During the resentencing hearing, the judge explained that the higher sentence was 'based on the nature of the crime and on the impressions which I formed of (respondent) and of the crime.'\n\n\n3\nRespondent appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals, which affirmed his conviction was approved the higher sentence. 18 Mich.App. 42, 170 N.W.2d 523 (1969). While the case was pending before the Michigan Supreme Court, the trial judge who had presided over respondent's second trial was requested to submit an affidavit detailing his reasons for imposing a higher sentence. The judge's affidavit stated that his sentencing determination was based primarily on (i) has personal belief that respondent's attitude since the first sentencing proceeding had changed from one of regret to remorselessness, (ii) his view that respondent's alibi defense, given under oath, was a 'tissue of lies,' and (iii) his heightened opportunity to learn of the details of the crime during the three-day trial.1\n\n\n4\nThe Michigan Supreme Court, in a 4-to-3 decision, upheld the conviction but rejected the higher sentence as violative of the due process restrictions established in North Carolina v. Pearce, supra. 386 Mich. 84, 191 N.W.2d 375 (1971). The court recognized that this Court had not yet decided whether Pearce applied to resentencing proceedings which, as in this case, occurred prior to Pearce's date of decision.2 While declining to predict how the retroactivity question would ultimately be resolved, the Michigan Supreme Court decided to apply Pearce to the case then before it 'pending clarification' by this Court. Id., at 90 n. 3, 191 N.W.2d, at 378 n. 2. Before this Court, the State contends that Pearce should not be applied retrospectively, but that, even if applicable, the state supreme court erred in holding the higher sentence invalid under the Pearce test. Because we hold today that Pearce does not apply retroactively, we do not reach the State's second contention.3\n\nII\n\n5\nIn Pearce, the Court emphasized that '(i)t can hardly be doubted' that, while 'there exists no absolute constitutional bar to the imposition of a more severe sentence upon retrial,' it would be entirely impermissible for judges to render harsher penalties as punishment for those defendants who have succeeded in getting their convictions reversed. 395 U.S., at 723, 89 S.Ct., at 2079. '(V) indictiveness' against a defendant for having exercised his rights to appeal or to attack his conviction collaterally, the Court held, 'must play no part in the sentence (a defendant) receives after a new trial.' Id., at 725, 89 S.Ct., at 2080. In so holding, the Court recognized that 'fundamental notions of fairness embodied within the concept of due process' absolutely preclude the imposition of sentences based upon such a \"retaliatory motivation.\" Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U.S. 17, at 25, 93 S.Ct. 1977, at 1982, 36 L.Ed.2d 714. No 'new' constitutional rule was thereby established and it cannot be questioned that this basic due process protection anticulated in Pearce is available equalty to defendants resentenced before and after the date of decision in that case. On this point the parties do not disagree.\n\n\n6\nThe dispute in this case centers, instead, around the 'prophylactic'4 limitations Pearce established to guard against the possibility of vindictiveness in the resentencing process. Those limitations, applicable 'whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial,' 395 U.S., at 726, 89 S.Ct., at 2081, require that the sentencing judge's reasons 'must affirmatively appear,' and that those reasons 'must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.' Ibid. The question here is whether these restrictions govern resentencing proceedings predating Pearce.\n\n\n7\nThe contours of the retroactivity inquiry have been clearly delineated in numerous decisions over the last decade. The test utilized repeatedly by this Court to ascertain whether 'new' constitutional protections in the area of criminal procedure are to be applied retroactively calls for the consideration of three criteria: '(a) the purpose to be served by the new standards, (b) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards.' Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 297, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 1970, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967). See also Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 629, 636, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 1737, 1741, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965); Tehan v. Shott, 382 U.S. 406, 410\u2014418, 86 S.Ct. 459, 461\u2014466, 15 L.Ed.2d 453 (1966); Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 726\u2014727, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 1777 1778, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966).\n\n\n8\nThe two purposes for the resentencing restrictions imposed by Pearce were to ensure (i) 'that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction . . . (would) play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial . . .' and (ii) that apprehension of such vindictiveness would not 'deter a defendant's exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his first conviction. . . .' 395 U.S., at 725, 89 S.Ct., at 2080; Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U.S. 104, 116, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 1960, 32 L.Ed.2d 584 (1972). The latter purpose is not pertinent to this case, since respondent was not deterred from exercising his right to challenge his first conviction. But, in any event, we think it clear that this function of the new resentencing rules could be served only in futuro: nothing in Pearce suggests that the Court contemplated that its decision might provide a ground for the untimely reopening of appeals by defendants who decided not to appeal prior to the date of decision in Pearce.5 See James v. Copinger, 441 F.2d 23 (CA4 1971).\n\n\n9\nThe first-articulated purpose of the Pearce rules\u2014to protect against the possibility that actual vindictiveness will infect a resentencing proceeding\u2014deserves closer scrutiny. Unlike the purposes underlying many of the decisions heretofore accorded retrospective application,6 this purpose does not implicate the \"fair determination' of . . . guilt or innocence.' Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 294, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 1922, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1968) (emphasis supplied). It does, however, involve questions touching on the 'integrity' of one aspect of the judicial process. McConnell v. Rhay, 393 U.S. 2, 3, 89 S.Ct. 32, 33, 21 L.Ed.2d 2 (1968). The Pearce restrictions serve to ensure that resentencing decisions will not be based on improper considerations, such as a judge's unarticulated resentment at having been reversed on appeal, or his subjective institutional interest in discouraging meritless appeals. By eliminating the possibility that these factors might occasion enhanced sentences, the Pearce prophylactic rules assist in guaranteeing the propriety of the sentencing phase of the criminal process. In this protective role, Pearce is analogous to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), in which the Court established rules to govern police practices during custodial interrogations in order to safeguard the rights of the accused and to assure the reliability of statements made during those interrogations. Thus, the prophylactic rules in Pearce and Miranda are similar in that each was designed to preserve the integrity of a phase of the criminal process. Because of this similarity, we find that Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966), which held Miranda nonretroactive, provides considerable guidance here. See also Jenkins v. Delaware, 395 U.S. 213, 89 S.Ct. 1677, 23 L.Ed.2d 253 (1969).\n\n\n10\nIt is an inherent attribute of prophylactic constitutional rules, such as those established in Miranda and Pearce, that their retrospective application will occasion windfall benefits for some defendants who have suffered no constitutional deprivation. Miranda's well-known warning requirements provided a protection 'against the possibility of unreliable statements in every instance of incustody interrogation,' and thereby covered many 'situations in which the danger (was) not necessarily as great as when the accused is subjected to overt and obvious coercion.' Johnson v. New Jersey, supra, 384 U.S., at 730, 86 S.Ct. at 1779 (emphasis supplied). Thus, had Miranda been applied retroactively, it would have required the reversal of many convictions in which no serious constitutional violation had occurred. Id., at 731, 86 S.Ct. at 1779. Likewise, the retroactive application of Pearce would require the repudiation of many sentences rendered under circumstances in which there was no genuine possibility that vindictiveness played a role. Judicial impropriety in the resentencing process, albeit intolerable wherever it happens, surely is not a common practice. Indeed, nothing in Pearce intimates that the Court regarded it as anything more than an infrequently appearing blemish on the sentencing process.7 Absent countervailing considerations rooted in the purposes underlying a new rule, this factor\u2014that retroactive application of such broadly protective rules would occasion reversals in many instances in which no actual prejudice has been suffered\u2014points toward a ruling of prospectivity.\n\n\n11\nNonretroactivity is also suggested by the second similarity between Miranda and Pearce. While each created a protective umbrella serving to enhance a constitutional guarantee, neither conferred a constitutional right that had not existed prior to those decisions. The right against use of an involuntary confession long preceded Miranda just as the right to be free from fundamentally unfair sentencing considerations predated Pearce. Supra, at 50. Because these foundational rights remain available to defendants in pre-Miranda and pre-Pearce cases, a decision of nonretroactivity is less likely to result in the continued incarceration of those whose convictions or sentences rest on unconstitutional acts.8 Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S., at 640, 85 S.Ct., at 1743 (Black, J., dissenting).\n\n\n12\nOf course, the question of the impact of particular decisions on the reliability and fairness of any aspect of a criminal proceeding is inherently a matter of balancing 'probabilities.' Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S., at 729, 86 S.Ct., at 1778; Adams v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 278, 281, 92 S.Ct. 916, 918, 31 L.Ed.2d 202 (1972). Yet in view of the fact that, if retroactive, Pearce would apply to innumerable cases in which no hint of vindictiveness appears, coupled with the consideration that due process claims may always be made in those prior cases in which some evidence of retaliatory motivation exists,9 we have little doubt that the 'probabilities' in this case preponderate in favor of a ruling of nonretroactivity.10\n\n\n13\nAlthough the remaining factors\u2014reliance and burden on the administration of justice\u2014have been regarded as having controlling significance 'only when the purpose of the rule in question did not clearly favor either retroactivity or prospectivity,' Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 251, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 1035, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969), those considerations also support the nonretroactivity of Pearce. The result in Pearce was not 'foreshadowed' by any prior decision of this Court.11 Indeed, prior to Pearce, resentencing judges were bound by no requirement that they articulate their reasons and generally enjoyed a wide discretion in terms of the factors they might legitimately consider. See Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949). Nor could it be said that the Court's decision was clearly forecast by any trend of lower court decisions. In Pearce itself the Court noted that lower federal and state courts were divided on all of the questions posed. 395 U.S., at 715 n. 5, 89 S.Ct., at 2075. Under these circumstances, judicial reliance on prior law was certainly justifiable.12\n\n\n14\nBecause of that reliance, it is fair to assume that in prior years few, if any, judges complied during resentencing with Pearce's recordation requirement, and that they often considered a variety of factors relating to the defendant and his crime which might or might not have fallen within the Pearce standard. We have been presented with no statistical indications as to how many persons received increased penalties after retrials.13 We cannot say, however, that the potential interference with the administration of justice would be insubstantial if Pearce were applied retroactively. In order to comply with Pearce, a resentencing judge\u2014assuming he is still on the bench or otherwise available\u2014would be required to make a factual determination as to the reasons for sentences he may have meted out years in the past. Compliance with that requirement would present considerable difficulties, since judges, like witnesses in criminal trials, lack infallible memories and perfect records of their motivations.14 Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S., at 637, 85 S.Ct., at 1742. While we would not shy from imposing these burdens were we persuaded that it was necessary to do so in order to effectuate the purposes underlying Pearce, we have found no such need here. In sum, upon application of the three-part test, we hold that the Pearce requirements are not to be accorded retroactive application.15\n\nIII\n\n15\nSince the resentencing hearing in this case took place approximately two years before Pearce was decided, we hold that the Michigan Supreme Court erred in applying its proscriptions here. Accordingly, the judgment of that court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n16\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n17\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n18\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\n\n19\nWe deal here with the guarantee contained in the Fifth Amendment, applicable to the States by reason of the Fourteenth, Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707, that no person shall 'be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.' The construction given that clause was applied retroactively in North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656; and I think that Payne as well as Pearce should have the benefit of the 'new' constitutional rule. My views have been at odds with those of the Court as witnessed by the dissent of Mr. Justice Black in Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 640, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 1743, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 which I joined, and by my separate dissent in Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 255, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 1037, 22 L.Ed.2d 248. I could understand making a 'new' constitutional rule applicable only prospectively. But I cannot bring myself to making the 'new' rule applicable to some but not to others. If a State has violated the Federal Constitution in convicting or sentencing a prisoner, I see no way of denying him relief from that unconstitutional trial or unconstitutional sentence.\n\n\n20\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause in my view was designed to discourage the abusive use by the Executive and Judicial Branches of the awesome power of government over the individual. Jeopardy attaches once the trial starts. If there is error in that trial and as a result a new trial is had, the Government cannot impose an added or increased sentence on the second trial. That is my view, as explained in North Carolina v. Pearce, supra, 395 U.S., at 726\u2014737, 89 S.Ct., at 2081\u20142082. Respondent received a sentence of 19 to 40 years on his first trial and a greater one of 25 to 50 years on his second trial. I therefore would affirm the judgment below.\n\n\n21\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, dissenting.\n\n\n22\nThe Court today holds that no limitations need be placed on resentencings that occurred before the date of decision in North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969). I believe however, that the State has an obligation to present to the court reviewing the second conviction evidence from which that court can determine whether a new sentence, more severe than that imposed at a prior trial, resulted in part from the sentencing authority's desire to punish the defendant for successfully appealing his first conviction.1 I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n\n23\n* This case raises the issue of retroactivity only because of the almost unbelievable sluggishness of the appellate process in Michigan. Payne's second sentence was imposed on August 30, 1967, nearly two years before Pearce was decided. However, the Michigan Court of Appeals did not decide Payne's appeal until July 28, 1969, one month after the decision in Pearce. The Michigan Supreme Court considered the case for two more years, finally deciding it on November 9, 1971. Had the appellate process in Michigan been at all expeditious, this Court might have used Payne's case as the vehicle to decide that harsher sentences on reconviction could be justified only by objective evidence of post-sentencing conduct by the defendant, the rule adopted in Pearce. The only difference between Pearce's case and Payne's, then, is that the former moved up to this Court more quickly than the latter. Different treatment of two cases is justified under our Constitution only when the cases differ in some respect relevant to the different treatment.2 And a difference in the speed with which a judicial system disposes of an appeal is not related in any way to the purposes served by the limitations that Pearce placed on resentencing. Thus, considerations of fairness rooted in the Constitution lead me to conclude that cases in the pipeline when a new constitutional rule is announced must be given the benefit of that rule.\n\n\n24\nThe rule adopted by the Court today is curious in another way. The Court appears to say that a defendant who failed to appeal his first conviction out of 'a reasonably based fear of actual vindictiveness,' ante, at 52 n. 5, is entitled to review of his conviction. Cf. Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 396\u2014397, n. 3, 83 S.Ct. 822, 825\u2014826, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963).3 If his appeal is successful, his new trial will occur after the date of decision in Pearce. Thus, any new sentence will be subject to the limitations imposed by Pearce. The rather strange result is that someone like Payne, who adhered to state procedural rules for vindicating his right to an error-free trial, may receive an enhanced sentence without limitation, while someone who did not adhere to those rules may not have his sentence increased unless the requirements of Pearce are met. I suppose that anomalies are occasionally inevitable, but I submit that we should consider very carefully any rule of retroactivity that has the effect of penalizing compliance with state procedural rules.\n\nII\n\n25\nThe Court applies the now-familiar three-pronged test to determine whether Pearce should be given retroactive effect, and it reaches the now-familiar result of nonretroactivity.4 I believe that principled adjudication requires the Court to abandon the charade of carefully balancing countervailing considerations when deciding the question of retroactivity. Inspecting the cases dealing with retroactivity, I find that they appear to fall into three groups. In some cases, this Court has held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction in the traditional sense. See, e.g., Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969); Waller v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387, 90 S.Ct. 1184, 25 L.Ed.2d 435 (1970). Those holdings have been made fully retroactive. Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970); Robinson v. Neil, 409 U.S. 505, 93 S.Ct. 876, 35 L.Ed.2d 29 (1973). Cf. United States v. United States Coin & Currency, 401 U.S. 715, 91 S.Ct. 1041, 28 L.Ed.2d 434 (1971). In other cases the Court announced a rule that was central to the process of determining guilt or innocence, and whose application might well have led to the acquittal of the defendant. See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963); In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). Those holdings too have been given retroactive effect. Pickelsimer v. Wainwright, 375 U.S. 2, 84 S.Ct. 80, 11 L.Ed.2d 41 (1963); Ivan V. v. New York, 407 U.S. 203, 92 S.Ct. 1951, 32 L.Ed.2d 659 (1972). Cf. Adams v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 278, 92 S.Ct. 916, 31 L.Ed.2d 202 (1972). All other constitutional rules of criminal procedure have been given prospective effect only.5\n\n\n26\nI confess that I have been unable to discover a principled basis for that threefold classification, but it does appear to be the factor operating in our cases. And I see little point in forcing lower courts to flounder without substantial guidance in the morass of our cases, by informing them that they are to apply a balancing test, when in fact it invariably occurs that the balancing test results in holdings of nonretroactivity. Furthermore, it demeans this Court to pretend to consider a variety of factors if, no matter how those factors are arrayed, the result is predetermined. An open-minded examination of this Court's cases on retroactivity compels the conclusion that the Court divides cases into several classes, and it is the classification, not the three-pronged test, that determines the result. Our time would be better spent, I think, in attempting to delineate the basis for those classifications, and to derive them from some constitutional principles, rather than in 'applying' a balancing test. Indeed, it might have been thought that Robinson v. Neil, supra, had begun the task of rationalizing our cases, but apparently that is not so.\n\nIII\n\n27\nThe holding of Pearce is a simple one: the Due Process Clause requires States to adopt procedures designed to minimize the possibility that a new sentence after a successful appeal will be based in part on vindictiveness for the defendant's having taken the appeal. The Court agrees that 'this basic due process protection . . . is available equally to defendants resentenced before and after the date of decision in that case.' Ante, at 50, 51. The question then is what procedures are required to insure that that protection has been afforded defendants resentenced before Pearce was decided. This question, like many of those involving retroactivity, relates to the integrity of the judicial process, not to the limitations placed by the Constitution on police behavior. One can agree that the precise requirements of Pearce are inappropriate for retrospective application largely because they are procedurally ill-adapted to the problem, yet disagree with the Court that the States need do nothing at all to convince a reviewing court that vindictiveness played no part in the resentencing. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Allen, 443 Pa. 96, 102, 277 A.2d 803 (1971).\n\n\n28\nThe issue need not be framed as the 'retroactivity' of Pearce. The problem, as I see it, is to devise procedures that will permit reviewing courts to determine whether the requirements of the Due Process Clause have been met. In Pearce we concluded that it would be enough for a judge, on resentencing a defendant, to state his reasons for imposing a more severe sentence. If the more severe sentence was based upon objective information, placed on the record, concerning the conduct of the defendant after the first sentencing, the more severe sentence was permissible. Such a rule, although not absolutely guaranteeing that vindictiveness will play no part,6 nonetheless substantially reduces the possibility that it will, without significantly interfering with the judge's lawful discretion.\n\n\n29\nA rather similar procedure would accomplish the same result for defendants resentenced before Pearce was decided. If a defendant did receive a harsher sentence after a successful appeal, and he seeks to have it reduced to the original sentence, the State should be required to present evidence that the new sentence was based on post-sentence conduct. In the absence of such evidence, the sentence must be reduced.7 The Court suggests that such a procedure would 'occasion windfall benefits for some defendants who have suffered no constitutional deprivaton.' Ante, at 53. That assertion must be considered more closely.\n\n\n30\nAs the Court notes, there is little evidence that more severe sentences are offen imposed. It cites an informal survey suggesting that 12% of reconvicted defendants receive higher sentences. Ante, at 56 n. 13. Even if that estimate is only half as large as the actual figure for pre-Pearce cases, still there are clearly very few defendants who have received harsher sentences. With respect to many of them, it will not be difficult to produce evidence supporting the new sentence. As in Moon v. Maryland, 398 U.S. 319, 90 S.Ct. 1730, 26 L.Ed.2d 262 (1970), and Odom v. United States, 400 U.S. 23, 91 S.Ct. 112, 27 L.Ed.2d 122 (1970), the sentencing judge might indicate by affidavit or order the grounds for his sentencing decision. If memories have faded, the State might show that a presentence report considered by the judge recited post-sentence conduct by the defendant that would justify the harsher sentence.\n\n\n31\nThus, I do not think that it can fairly be said that the requirements I would impose would in fact result in windfall benefits to 'innumerable' defendants, ante, at 55; they would accrue to those few defendants who were convicted, successfully appealed, were reconvicted, and receiver harsher sentences so long ago that the State cannot produce evidence from which a reviewing court could find that vindictiveness played no part in the sentencing decision.8 And the 'windfall benefits' would impair no substantial state interest in incarcerating those few offenders. Unlike the suppression of probative evidence that might severely limit the State's ability to secure a conviction of a person who undoubtedly committed an offense, here the remedy is simply the reduction of sentence. North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244, 247, 92 S.Ct. 402, 404, 30 L.Ed.2d 413 (1971). The sentence to be served would be one that had already been found appropriate by one judge, and would therefore satisfy the various interests advanced by incarceration.9\n\n\n32\nFor these reasons, I dissent.\n\n\n33\nMr. Justice STEWART joins Part III of this opinion.\n\n\n\n1\n In his affidavit, the second sentencing judge indicated that a different judge who presided over respondent's prior guilty plea and sentencing hearings did not have as good an opportunity to become fully informed of the details of the 'deliberate, cold-blooded attack.' In a subsequent amendatory affidavit filed by the same judge, he corrected his prior affidavit by stating that the first judge did have 'some limited opportunity to see and hear (respondent) when he testified as a witness for the prosecution against his accomplice' in a separate trial. The parties in this case now agree that the first judge did preside over the trial of respondent's codefendant before sentencing respondent and that respondent did testify at that trial. The parties continue, however, to dispute whether that opportunity was as complete as the opportunity afforded the second judge, and, if not, whether this is a permissible consideration in resentencing under Pearce. Because of the manner in which we dispose of this case, we need not resolve this controversy. See n. 3, infra.\n\n\n2\n This Court has twice previously granted certiorari to resolve this question, but on each occasion the writ was dismissed as improvidently granted. Moon v. Maryland, 398 U.S. 319, 90 S.Ct. 1730, 26 L.Ed.2d 262 (1970) (cert. granted, 395 U.S. 975, 89 S.Ct. 2135, 23 L.Ed.2d 764 (1969)); Odom v. United States, 400 U.S. 23, 91 S.Ct. 112, 27 L.Ed.2d 122 (1970) (cert. granted, 399 U.S. 904, 90 S.Ct. 2203, 26 L.Ed.2d 559 (1970)).\n\n\n3\n This Court has consistently declined to reach out to resolve unsettled questions regarding the scope or meaning of decisions establishing 'new' constitutional requirements in cases in which it holds any such decisions nonretroactive. See Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967) (holding United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), and Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967), nonretroactive without resolving the question whether those cases were applicable to preformal accusation confrontations, a question later decided in Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 32 L.Ed.2d 411 (1972)); DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U.S. 631, 88 S.Ct. 2093, 20 L.Ed.2d 1308 (1968) (holding Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968), and Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194, 88 S.Ct. 1477, 20 L.Ed.2d 522 (1968), nonretroactive and declining to decide whether a summary contempt proceeding that results in a one-year sentence is a 'serious' offense requiring trial by jury, a question later decided in Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. 66, 90 S.Ct. 1886, 26 L.Ed.2d 437 (1970)); Carcerano v. Gladden (a companion case with DeStefano, in which the Court declined to decide whether the right to jury trial contemplated by Duncan also required a unanimous verdict, a question later decided in Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404, 92 S.Ct. 1628, 32 L.Ed.2d 184 (1972)); Elkanich v. United States (a companion case with Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 28 L.Ed.2d 388 (1971), holding Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969), nonretroactive and declining to decide whether the search was otherwise compatible with the Chimel limitations on searches incident to lawful arrests).\n\n\n4\n Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, supra, 412 U.S., at 25, 93 S.Ct., at 1982; Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U.S. 104, 116, 118, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 1960, 1961, 32 L.Ed.2d 584 (1972).\n\n\n5\n This is not to suggest, of course, that there may not be specific cases in which a convicted defendant might show that his initial waiver of his right to appeal was involuntary because caused by a reasonably based fear of actual vindictiveness on the part of a particular judge. Cf. North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S., at 725 n. 20, 89 S.Ct., at 2080.\n\n\n6\n See, e.g., In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970) (held retroactive in Ivan V. v. New York, 407 U.S. 203, 92 S.Ct. 1951, 32 L.Ed.2d 659 (1972); Barber v. Page, 390 U.S. 719, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 20 L.Ed.2d 255 (1968) (held retroactive in Berger v. California, 393 U.S. 314, 89 S.Ct. 540, 21 L.Ed.2d 508 (1969)); Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968) (held retroactive in Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1968)); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963).\n\n\n7\n The most that may be said is that the Court in Pearce found that 'increased sentences on reconviction are far from rare,' 395 U.S., at 725 n. 20, 89 S.Ct., at 2080, and that it was persuaded that vindictiveness played a role in a sufficient number of those cases to 'warrant the imposition of a prophylactic rule.' Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U.S., at 116, 92 S.Ct., at 1960.\n\n\n8\n See Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966). See also Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S., at 299, 87 S.Ct., at 299 (in pre-Wade-Gilbert cases 'it remains open to all persons to allege and prove . . . that the confrontation . . . infringed his right to due process of law'); cf. Halliday v. United States, 394 U.S. 831, 833, 89 S.Ct. 1498, 1499, 23 L.Ed.2d 16 (1969).\n\n\n9\n Of course, it remains true that 'retaliatory motivation' may be 'difficult to prove in any individual case.' North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S., at 725 n. 20, 89 S.Ct., at 2080. And, this is certainly one of the reasons why the Court in Pearce adopted prophylactic rules. Similar problems of proof prompted the decisions in Miranda and Wade, but such problems in themselves were not sufficient to warrant retrospective application.\n\n\n10\n We reiterate here what the Court has repeatedly said in retroactivity cases: '(W)e do not disparage a constitutional guarantee in any manner by declining to apply it retroactively.' Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S., at 728, 86 S.Ct., at 1778; cf. Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 629, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 1737, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965).\n\n\n11\n Compare Berger v. California, 393 U.S. 314, 89 S.Ct. 540, 21 L.Ed.2d 508 (1969), and Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1968), with Adams v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 278, 92 S.Ct. 916, 31 L.Ed.2d 202 (1972), and Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S., at 731, 86 S.Ct., at 1779.\n\n\n12\n We need not disagree with Mr. Justice MARSHALL'S notation, post, at 66 n. 9, that the result in Pearce was foreshadowed, i.e., that higher sentences on retrial were being questioned. Our focus here, however, is on the prophylactic measure adopted to achieve that result. As to this, we do not think there is any serious question that neither the recordation requirement nor the limitations on matters to be considered were so clearly forecast as to render a contrary state reliance unjustifiable.\n\n\n13\n See Note, Constitutional Law: Increased Sentence and Denial of Credit on Retrial Sustained under Traditional Waiver Theory, 1965 Duke L.J. 395, 399 n. 25 (informal survey of North Carolina courts showed that six of 50 reconvicted defendants received higher sentences).\n\n\n14\n Thus, the retroactivity of Pearce would present difficulties not encountered in two of the Court's recent decisions holding retroactive cases involving resentencing: Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972) (the 'death penalty' case); Robinson v. Neil, 409 U.S. 505, 93 S.Ct. 876, 35 L.Ed.2d 29 (1973) (holding Waller v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387, 90 S.Ct. 1184, 25 L.Ed.2d 435 (1970) retroactive). In both cases, '(t)hat which was constitutionally invalid could be isolated and excised without requiring the State to begin the entire factfinding process anew.' Robinson v. Neil, supra, at 510, 93 S.Ct., at 879.\n\n\n15\n Respondent, relying on Linkletter v. Walker, supra, and Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott, 382 U.S. 406, 86 S.Ct. 459, 15 L.Ed.2d 453 (1966), urges the Court to distinguish between cases, like his, on direct appeal and those arising after a conviction and sentence have become final. We think the above-stated reasons for applying Pearce prospectively apply with equal force to all cases in which resentencing proceedings occurred before June 23, 1969, the date of decision in Pearce. See Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S., at 300, 87 S.Ct., at 300; Desist v. United States, 394 U.S., at 252, 89 S.Ct., at 1035; Williams v. United States, 401 U.S., at 651\u2014652, 91 S.Ct., at 1151\u20141152.\n\n\n1\n The State did present an affidavit from the sentencing judge in this case. The Michigan Supreme Court held that it did not satisfy the requirement of North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 726, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2081, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), that more severe sentences can be justified only by 'objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.' See 386 Mich. 84, 97, 191 N.W.2d 375, 381 (1971). Petitioner contends that this holding was erroneous. Petition for Writ of Certiorari 5\u20146. The Court does not address this contention, nor shall I.\n\n\n2\n Since Payne's appeal was pending when Pearce was decided, I need not consider whether different considerations, such as the defendant's failure to raise the issue in seeking review from this Court or to persuade us on the merits, might suffice under the Due Process Clause to justify different treatment of defendants whose sentences had become final.\n\n\n3\n Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting in Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 475, 83 S.Ct. 822, 867, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963), suggested that the possibility of an enhanced sentence after a successful appeal, according to the Court, precluded the State from relying on a failure to appeal as an adequate state ground supporting the denial of relief under federal habeas corpus. On his interpretation, then, Fay anticipated the holding in Pearce.\n\n\n4\n In holding various rulings retroactive, this Court has given only the most cursory nod to the three-pronged test. See, e.g., Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1968); McConnell v. Rhay, 393 U.S. 2, 89 S.Ct. 32, 21 L.Ed.2d 2 (1968); Arsenault v. Massachusetts, 393 U.S. 5, 89 S.Ct. 35, 21 L.Ed.2d 5 (1968).\n\n\n5\n Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965), giving a limited retroactive effect to Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), is an anomaly at odds with the Court's subsequent treatment of problems of retroactivity and can be explained only by the Court's unfamiliarity with those problems when the case was decided. See also Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966).\n\n\n6\n For example, the sentencing judge, had he considered the case as an initial matter, might have imposed a sentence shorter than that imposed at the first trial, but, out of vindictiveness, he might decide to reimpose the original sentence. The procedures outlined in Pearce cannot prevent this.\n\n\n7\n I assume that the Court's reliance on the continuing availability of the 'foundational' right means that an offender who shows that vindictiveness played a part in his resentencing is entitled to relief I would simply shift the burden of proof to the State, which has better access to the relevant facts.\n\n\n8\n State courts, closer to the problems of administering the rule I suggest, have widely thought that those burdens are not substantial. See, e.g., Stonom v. Wainwright, 235 So.2d 545 (Fla.App.1970); People v. Baze, 43 Ill.2d 298, 253 N.E.2d 392 (1969); State v. Pilcher, 171 N.W.2d 251 (Iowa 1969); Hord v. Commonwealth, 450 S.W.2d 530 (Ky.1970); State v. Rentschler, 444 S.W.2d 453 (Mo.1969); Commonwealth v. Allen, 443 Pa. 96, 277 A.2d 803 (1971); Denny v. State, 47 Wis.2d 541, 178 N.W.2d 38 (1970).\n\n\n9\n The Court's conclusion that Pearce was not foreshadowed by decisions in this Court or by a trend of lower court decisions is somewhat misleading. This Court's decision in Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957), raised substantial questions under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the constitutionality of enhanced sentences after a successful appeal. Also, one reading of Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 337 (1963), suggested by the dissent of Mr. Justice Harlan, is that a State may not burden the right to appeal with the possibility of an enhanced sentence. And prior to Pearce, the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Circuits had held that enhanced sentences after re-conviction could be justified only in limited circumstances. See Marano v. United States, 374 F.2d 583 (CA1 1967); United States v. Coke, 404 F.2d 836 (CA2 1968) (en banc); Patton v. North Carolina, 381 F.2d 636 (CA4 1967); Simpson v. Rice, 396 F.2d 499 (CA5 1968); United States v. White, 382 F.2d 445 (CA7 1967). So had the California Supreme Court, in a powerful opinion by Justice Traynor. People v. Henderson, 60 Cal.2d 482, 35 Cal.Rptr. 77, 386 P.2d 677 (1963). Finally, a 'learned and effective article,' as Judge Friendly called it in United States v. Coke, supra, arguing the same point, appeared in 1965. Van Alstyne, In Gideon's Wake: Harsher Penalties and the 'Successful' Criminal Appellant, 74 Yale L.J. 606 (1965). I would think that these decisions and commentary had prepared the ground rather well for Pearce, as the Court concedes, ante, at 56 n. 12. Yet if the result was foreshadowed, it is not unreasonable to require States now to supplement the record, so that it will be clear that unconstitutional sentences were not imposed. Because it insists on treating the issue here as a question of retroactivity, the Court does not address this argument.\n\n\n","label":0}

Zuckerman, New York City, for appellees.\nMr. Justice BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis case was argued with Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U.S. 526, 89 S.Ct. 1225, 22 L.Ed.2d 519, which affirmed the judgment of a three-judge District Court declaring invalid Missouri's 1967 congressional districting statute. Before us  ere is a judgment of a three-judge District Court for the Southern District of New York which sustained the validity of New York's 1968 congressional districting statute, N.Y.Laws 1968, c. 8, 281 F.Supp. 821 (1968). In 1967 that court had struck down an earlier districting statute apportioning New York's 41 congressional seats and had retained jurisdiction of the case pending action by the New York Legislature to redress the plan's deficiencies. The court recognized that a thorough revision of district lines might not be possible in time for the upcoming 1968 congressional election but concluded nevertheless that '(t)here are enough changes which can be superimposed on the present districts to cure the most flagrant inequalities.' 273 F.Supp. 984, 992, aff'd, 389 U.S. 421, 88 S.Ct. 578, 19 L.Ed.2d 651 (1967).\n\n\n2\nOn February 28, 1968, a month and a half after the New York Legislature reconvened, the districting statute presently under attack was enacted. After a hearing, the three-judge court, on March 20, 1968, sustained the statute, stating that the districting plan afforded New York voters 'an opportunity to vote in the 1968 and 1970 elections on a basis of population equality within reasonably comparable districts.' 281 F.Supp., at 826. We noted probable jurisdiction. 393 U.S. 819, 89 S.Ct. 115, 21 L.Ed.2d 91 (1968). We reverse insofar as the judgment of the District Court sustains the plan for use in the 1970 congressional election.\n\n\n3\nAppellant levels two constitutional attacks against the statute: (1) that the statute violates the equal-population principle of Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 526, 11 L.Ed.2d 481 (1964), and (2) that the statute represents a systematic and intentional partisan gerrymander violating Art. I, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment. We do not reach, and intimate no view upon the merits of, the attack upon the statute as a constitutionally impermissible gerrymander. We hold that reversal of the District Court's judgment is compelled by our decision today in Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, supra, which elucidates the command of Wesberry that congressional districting meet the standard of equal representation for equal numbers of people as nearly as is practicable.\n\n\n4\nThe District Court correctly held in its 1967 opinion that 'there is a burden on the proponent of any districting plan to justify deviations from equality.' 273 F.Supp., at 987. The District Court took no testimony on the question of justification at the hearing held to consider the 1968 statute. Recognizing that the statute, which was enacted with virtually no debate on its merits in either house of the New York Legislature, was the work of a Joint Legislative Committee, the court's 1968 opinion refers to the Report of the Joint Committee as the source of the justifications relied upon as sufficient to sustain the population disparities created by the plan. 281 F.Supp., at 823\u2014824. We have been referred to the same source.\n\n\n5\nThe Report recites that the Committee 'gave priority to the population totals in the several districts' as they appeared in the 1960 decennial census and that 'very limited consideration was given to population shifts within the State since 1960. The Report recites further that '(o)ther considerations were the geographical conformation of the area to be districted, the maintenance of county integrity, the facility by which the various Boards of Elections can 'tool up' for the forthcoming (1968) primary election, equality of population within the region, and equality of population throughout the state.' Interim Report of the Joint Legislative Committee on Reapportionment of N.Y. State Legislature (1968).\n\n\n6\nThe heart of the scheme, however, lay in the decision to treat seven sections of the State as homogeneous regions and to divide each region into congressional districts of virtually identical population. Thirty-one of New York's 41 congressional districts were constructed on that principle. The remaining 10 istricts were composed of groupings of whole counties. A chart showing the population of each district under the 1968 statute appears in the Appendix to this opinion. The seven regions are: (a) Suffolk and Nassau Counties on Long Island with five districts having an average population of 393,391 and a maximum deviation from that average of 208; (b) Queens County with four districts having an average population of 434,672 and a maximum deviation from that average of 120; (c) Kings County plus a district made up of part of Kings and part of Queens, and a district made up of Richmond County and part of Kings, with seven districts having an average population of 417,171 and a maximum deviation from that average of 307; (d) New York and Bronx Counties with eight districts having an average population of 390,415 and a maximum deviation from that average of 496; (e) Westchester and Putnam Counties with two districts having an average population of 420,307 and a maximum deviation from that average of 161; (f) Wayne plus part of Monroe and the remainder of Monroe plus four other counties with two districts having an average population of 410,688 and a maximum deviation from that average of 256; and (g) Erie and Niagara Counties with three districts having an average population of 435,652 and a maximum deviation from that average of 228. The 10 remaining 'North country' districts were composed of groupings of whole counties.\n\n\n7\nIt is clear that our decision in Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, supra, compels the conclusion that this scheme is unconstitutional. We there held, 394 U.S., at 531, 89 S.Ct., at 1239, that 'the command of Art. I, \u00a7 2, that States create congressional districts which provide equal representation for equal numbers of people permits only the limited population variances which are unavoidable despite a good-faith effort to achieve absolute equality, or for which justification is shown.' The general command, of course, is to equalize population in all the districts of the State and is not satisfied by equalizing population only within defined sub-states. New York could not and does not claim that the legislature made a good-faith effort to achieve precise mathematical equality among its 41 congressional districts. Rather, New York tries to justify its scheme of constructing equal districts only within each of seven sub-states as a means to keep regions with distinct interests intact. But we made clear in Kirkpatrick that 'to accept population variances, large or small, in order to create districts with specific interest orientations is antithetical to the basic premise of the constitutional command to provide equal representation for equal numbers of people.' To accept a scheme such as New York's would permit groups of districts with defined interest orientations to be overrepresented at the expense of districts with different interest orientations. Equality of population among districts in a sub-state is not a justification for inequality among all the districts in the State.\n\n\n8\nNor are the variations in the 'North country' districts justified by the fact that these districts are constructed of entire counties. Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, supra.\n\n\n9\nWe appreciate that the decision of the District Court did not rest entirely on an appraisal of the merits of the New York plan. As noted earlier, when the three-judge District Court in 1967 held the then-existing districting plan unconstitutional, it recognized that the imminence of the 1968 election made redistricting an unrealistic possibility and therefore said only that '(t)here are enough changes which can be superimposed on the present districts to cure the most flagrant inequalities.' 273 F.Supp., at 992. On February 26, 1968, the New York Legislature enacted the plan before us. On March 20, 1968, the District Court approved the plan for both the 1968 and 1970 congressional elections. Since the 1968 primary election was only three months away on March 20, we cannot say that there was error in p rmitting the 1968 election to proceed under the plan despite its constitutional infirmities. See Kilgarlin v. Hill, 386 U.S. 120, 121, 87 S.Ct. 820, 821, 17 L.Ed.2d 771 (1967); Martin v. Bush, 376 U.S. 222, 223, 84 S.Ct. 709, 11 L.Ed.2d 656 (1964); Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 390 U.S. 939, 88 S.Ct. 1053, 19 L.Ed.2d 1129 (1968). But ample time remains to promulgate a plan meeting constitutional standards before the election machinery must be set in motion for the 1970 election.

Preisler, 394 U.S. 526, 89 S.Ct. 1225, 22 L.Ed.2d 519, which I have not joined for the reasons stated in my concurring opinion in those cases.\n\n\n65\nNew York does not attempt to defend its plan as a good-faith effort to achieve districts of approximate equality. It argues that it devised a plan based upon the grouping of districts into regions. I agree with the majority that, for purposes of the congressional districting here involved, the State may not substantially or grossly disregard population or residence figures in order to recognize regional groupings within the State. See my dissent in Avery v. Midland County,  90 U.S. 474, 495, 88 S.Ct. 1114, 1126, 20\n\n\n66\nMr. Justice HARLAN, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART joins, dissenting.\n\n\n67\nWhatever room remained under this Court's prior decisions for the free play of the political process in matters of reapportionment is now all but eliminated by today's Draconian judgments. Marching to the nonexistent 'command of Art. I, \u00a7 2' of the Constitution,1 the Court now transforms a political slogan into a constitutional absolute. Straight indeed is the path of the righteous legislator. Slide rule in hand, he must avoid all thought of county lines, local traditions, politics, history, and economics, so as to achieve the magic formula: one man, one vote.\n\n\n68\nAs my Brothers WHITE and FORTAS demonstrate, insistence on mathematical perfection does not make sense even on its own terms. Census figures themselves are inexact; our mobile population rapidly renders them obsolete; large groups of ineligible voters are unevenly distributed throughout the State. Nevertheless, the Court refuses to permit any room for legislative common sense to compensate for Census Bureau inadequacies. If no 'scientific' data are available to justify a divergence from census figures, the Court holds that nothing can be done\u2014'we mean to open no avenue for subterfuge.' Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U.S., at 535, 89 S.Ct., at 1231.\n\n\n69\nThis all-pervasive distrust of the legislative process is completely alien to established notions of judicial review. See Butler v. Pennsylvania, 10 How. 402, 13 L.Ed. 472 (1851); Davis v. Department of Labor, 317 U.S. 249, 63 S.Ct. 225, 87 L.Ed. 246 (1942); Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (1960). Nor does it have precedent in the prior reapportionment decisions themselves. 'Reynolds v. Sims (377 U.S. 553, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506) recognized that mathematical exactness is not required in state apportionment plans. De minimis deviations are unavoidable * * *.' Swann v. Adams, 385 U.S. 440, 444, 87 S.Ct. 569, 17 L.Ed.2d 501 (1967); see also Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 18, 84 S.Ct. 526, 535, 11 L.Ed.2d 481 (1964).2\n\n\n70\nEven more important, the Court's exclusive concentration upon arithmetic blinds it to the realities of the political process, as the Rockefeller case makes so clear. The fact of the matter is that the rule of absolute equality is perfectly compatible with 'gerrymandering' of the worst sort. A computer may grind out district lines which can totally frustrate the popular will on an overwhelming number of critical issues. The legislature must do more than satisfy one man, one vote; it must create a structure which will in fact as well as theory be responsive to the sentiments of the community  On the record before us, however, there is absolutely no indication that the New York Legislature can satisfy this Court's demand for absolute equality and yet create a structure which will permit New York's multitude of political groups to have a fair chance at having their voices heard in Congress.\n\n\n71\nEven the appellant himself does not suggest that it is possible to create a proper apportionment plan which is at the same time consistent with the demands of perfect mathematical equality. The plan he advances contemplates a maximum deviation of 4.7% from the state average, which represents an improvement of only 1.9 percentage points on the State's 6.6% deviation. Moreover, under the State's plan, a majority of the congressional delegation can represent no less than 49.3% of the population. The appellant's scheme 'improves' this figure by 0.5%, increasing the number to 49.8% See Appellant's Appendix D. Perfection, however, is still 0.2% away.\n\n\n72\nAlthough the appellant's plan offers such marginal benefits of voting egalitarianism, and although the record contains no suggestion of any other plan which even arguably permits the coherent expression of the popular will, the Court rejects the legislature's considered proposal simply because it seeks to remain true to traditional county and regional lines. In doing so, the majority ignores the salutary warning to be found in Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 578\u2014579, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1390, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964): 'Indiscriminate districting, without any regard for political subdivision or natural or historical boundary lines, may be little more than an open invitation to partisan gerrymandering.' Yet, today the Court condemns the legislature's approach because it 'permit(s) groups of districts with defined interest orientations to be over represented at the expense of districts with different interest orientations.' Wells v. Rockefeller, 394 U.S., at 546, 89 S.Ct., at 1237. Of course, all districting decisions inevitably involve choices between different interest groups. But as Reynolds recognized, legislatures prefer to follow traditional county and regional lines so that the demands of blatant partisanship will be tempered by the constraints of history and tradition. If the Court believes it has struck a blow today for fully responsive representative democracy, it is sorely mistaken. Even more than in the past, district lines are likely to be drawn to maximize the political advantage of the party temporarily dominant in public affairs.\n\n\n73\nWe do not deal here with the hopelessly malapportioned legislature unwilling to set its own house in order. Rather, the question before us is whether the Constitution requires that mathematics be a substitute for common sense in the art of statecraft. As I do not think that the apportionment plans submitted by the States of New York and Missouri can properly be regarded as offensive to the requirement of equality imposed in Wesberry\u2014a case whose constitutional reasoning I still find it impossible to swallow, but by whose dictate I consider myself bound\u2014I dissent.\n\n\n74\nI would reverse the judgments of the District Court in the Missouri cases and affirm the decision of the District Court in the New York case.L.Ed.2d 45 (1968).\n\n\n75\nMr. Justice WHITE, dissenting.\n\n\n76\nI have consistently joined the Court's opinions which establish as one of the ground rules for legislative districting that single member districts should be substantially equal in population. I would not now dissent if the Court's present judgments represented a measurable contribution to the ends whic I had thought the Court was pursuing in this area, or even if I thought the opinions not very useful but not harmful either. With all due respect, however, I am firmly convinced that the Court's new rulings are unduly rigid and unwarranted applications of the Equal Protection Clause which will unnecessarily involve the courts in the abrasive task of drawing district lines.\n\n\n77\nAccepting for constitutional purposes that a State may assign the task of apportioning its legislature or congressional delegation to the legislature itself, I would not quibble with the legislative judgment if variations between districts were acceptably small. And I would be willing to establish a population variation figure which if not exceeded would normally not call for judicial intervention. As a rule of thumb, a variation between the largest and the smallest district of no more than 10% to 15% would satisfy me, absent quite unusual circumstances not present in any of these cases. At the very least, at this trivial level, I would be willing to view state explanations of the variance with a more tolerant eye.\n\n\n78\nThis would be far more reasonable than the Court's demand for an absolute but illusory equality or for an apportionment plan which approaches this goal so nearly that no other plan can be suggested which would come nearer. As Mr. Justice FORTAS demonstrates, the 1960 census figures were far from accurate when they were compiled by professional enumerators and statisticians bent on precision, in 1960. Massive growth and shifts in population since 1960 made the 1960 figures even more inaccurate by 1967. That is why a new census is taken every 10 years. When the Court finds a 3% variation from substantially inexact figures constitutionally impermissible it is losing perspective and sticking at a trifle.\n\n\n79\nIt also seems arbitrary for the majority to discard the suggestion of Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964), that if a legislature seeks an apportionment plan which respects the boundaries of political subdivisions, some variations from absolute equality would be constitutionally permissible. Of course, Reynolds involved state legislative apportionment and took pains to say that there may be more leeway in that context. But the Court invokes Reynolds today and in no way distinguishes federal from state districting.\n\n\n80\nReynolds noted that '(i)ndiscriminate districting, without any regard for political subdivision or natural or historical boundary lines, may be little more than an open invitation to partisan gerrymandering.' 377 U.S., at 578\u2014579, 84 S.Ct., at 1390. The Court nevertheless now rules that regard for these boundaries is no justification for districts which vary no more than 3% from the norm where another plan which may have no regard for district lines reduces the variation to an even smaller figure. I have similar objections to the Court's rejection of geographical compactness as an acceptable justification for minor variations among congressional districts. This rejection of the virtues of compactness will not be lost on those who would use congressional and legislative districting to bury their political opposition.\n\n\n81\nIn reality, of course, districting is itself a gerrymandering in the sense that it represents a complex blend of political, economic, regional, and historical considerations. In terms of the gerrymander, the situation will not be much different if equality means what it literally says\u2014a zero variation\u2014rather than only 'substantial' equality which would countenance some variations among legislative districts. Either standard will prevent a minority of the population or a minority party from consistently controlling the state legislature or a congressional delegation, and both are powerful forces toward equalizing voter influence on legislative performance. In terms of effective representation for all voters there are only minuscule differences between the two standards. But neither rule can alone prevent de iberate partisan gerrymandering if that is considered an evil which the Fourteenth Amendment should attempt to proscribe.\n\n\n82\nToday's decisions on the one hand require precise adherence to admittedly inexact census figures, and on the other downgrade a restraint on a far greater potential threat to equality of representation, the gerrymander. Legislatures intent on minimizing the representation of selected political or racial groups are invited to ignore political boundaries and compact districts so long as they adhere to population equality among districts using standards which we know and they know are sometimes quite incorrect. I see little merit in such a confusion of priorities.\n\n\n83\nMoreover, today's decisions will lead to an unnecessary intrusion of the judiciary into legislative business. It would be one thing if absolute equality were possible. But, admittedly, it is not. The Court may be groping for a cleancut, per se rule which will minimize confrontations between courts and legislatures while also satisfying the Fourteenth Amendment. If so, the Court is wide of the mark. Today's results simply shift the area of dispute a few percentage points down the scale; the courts will now be engaged in quibbling disputes over such questions as whether a plan with a 1% variation is 'better' than one with a larger variation, say 1.1% or even 2%. If county and municipal boundaries are to be ignored, a computer can produce countless plans for absolute population equality, one differing very little from another, but each having its own very different political ramifications. Ultimately, the courts may be asked to decide whether some families in an apartment house should vote in one district and some in another, if that would come closer to the standard of apparent equality. Using the spacious language of the Equal Protection Clause to inject the courts into these minor squabbles is an unacceptable pre-emption of the legislative function. Not only will the Court's new rule necessarily precipitate a new round of congressional and legislative districting, but also I fear that in the long run the courts, rather than the legislatures or nonpartisan commissions, will be making most of the districting decisions in the several States. Since even at best, with compact and equal districts, the final boundary lines unavoidably have significant political repercussions, the courts should not draw district lines themselves unnecessarily. I therefore dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n See Wells v. Rockefeller, 394 U.S. 542, at 546, 89 S.Ct. 1234, at 1237, 22 L.Ed.2d 535; Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U.S. 526, at 531, 89 S.Ct. 1225 at 1229, 22 L.Ed.2d 519. I have discussed in my dissenting opinion in Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 20, 84 S.Ct. 526, 11 L.Ed.2d 481 (1964), the extraordinary historical leap involved in reading the straightforward constitutional provision that 'The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States * * *' as a command for equal districts.\n\n\n2\n While Wesberry cautions that 'it may not be possible to draw congressional districts with mathematical precision,' 376 U.S., at 18, 84 S.Ct., at 535, it did not attempt to delineate the extent to which the States may properly deviate from the 'ideal.'\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"348 U.S. 540\n75 S.Ct. 509\n99 L.Ed. 624\nLouis SHOMBERG, Petitioner,v.UNITED STATES of America.\nNo. 48.\nArgued March 1, 1955.\nDecided April 4, 1955.\n\nMr.\nAlan Y. Cole, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nMr. Gray Thoron, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nMr. Justice CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe precise issue in this proceeding is whether petitioner, who filed his petition for naturalization two days before the effective date of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq., 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 et seq., may compel a final hearing on the same before the determination of deportation proceedings instituted after the effective date of the Act and based solely on grounds initiated by that Act. The 'priority provision' of the Act, \u00a7 318, states 'no petition for naturalization shall be finally heard * * * if there is pending against the petitioner a deportation proceeding.' 66 Stat. 244, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1429.1 But petitioner claims that the savings clause of the Act, \u00a7 405, 66 Stat. 280, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101, note, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 note, which we considered in United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 75 S.Ct. 513, preserves his eligibility for citizenship under prior law, and that final hearing thereon cannot be delayed by reason of the pendency of the subsequently instituted deportation action. Both the trial court, 115 F.Supp. 336, and the Court of Appeals, 210 F.2d 82, decided against the petitioner. We granted certiorari, 348 U.S. 811, 75 S.Ct. 24, in order to determine the relationship between \u00a7 318 and \u00a7 405 of the 1952 Act.\n\n\n2\nOn October 1, 1952, petitioner submitted to the Immigration and Naturalization Service a preliminary application to file a petition for naturalization, Form N\u2014400. Following a preliminary examination, he filed his petition for naturalization on December 22, 1952, two days before the effective date of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. The prenaturalization investigation disclosed that petitioner had a criminal record; he had been convicted of grand larceny in 1913 and of manslaughter in 1915. Section 241(a) of the 1952 Act subjects aliens to deportation if they are convicted 'at any time after entry * * * of two crimes involving moral turpitude, not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct.' 66 Stat. 204, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(4), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1251(a)(4). On June 22, 1953, a warrant of arrest was issued against petitioner, based on his 1913 and 1915 convictions, charging as grounds for deportation petitioner's presence in the country in violation of \u00a7 241(a)(4). The deportation proceedings were in progress when on July 28, 1953, petitioner, through an order to show cause filed in this case, moved to compel a final hearing on his petition for naturalization, and, in the interim, to stay the deportation proceedings. Relying on \u00a7 318, supra, the district judge denied the motion and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\n\n\n3\nPetitioner's main argument is that under \u00a7 405(a) nothing contained in the new Act, 'unless otherwise specifically provided therein, shall be construed to affect * * * any status, condition, right in process of acquisition * * * done or existing, at the time this Act shall take effect.' Petitioner was eligible for citizenship under the prior law and remains eligible under the new Act. But under the prior law petitioner was not deportable. Petitioner argues that the deportation proceeding, based solely on \u00a7 241(a) of the new Act,2 is adversely affecting a right protected by \u00a7 405(a), to wit, his inchoate right to citizenship. This, he claims, is in direct contravention of the terms of \u00a7 405(a) unless some other section in the Act 'otherwise specifically provide(s).' Section 318, advanced as just such an exception, says 'Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405(b) * * *,' and makes no mention of \u00a7 405(a). Thus, petitioner concludes, \u00a7 318 is not a specific exception to the protection afforded his rights by \u00a7 405(a), and if he is to vindicate his rights under that section he must prevail in the present proceedings.\n\n\n4\nWe agree with petitioner that, absent a specific provision to the contrary, he has rights protected by \u00a7 405(a). These stem from the filing of his Form N\u2014400, from his petition for naturalization, and, perhaps, from his fulfillment of the five-year residence requirement. United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 75 S.Ct. 513. But we hold that \u00a7 318 specifically excepts rights under the prior law from the protection of \u00a7 405 when these rights stem from a petition for naturalization or from some other step in the naturalization process.3\n\n\n5\nThe practice previous to the enactment of a priority provision in the immigration and nationality laws was for both the deportation and naturalization processes to proceed along together until either petitioner's deportation or naturalization ipso facto terminated the possibility of the other occurring. See United States v. Waskowski, 7 Cir., 158 F.2d 962. And in the few instances where deportations were stayed in order to permit aliens to obtain a hearing under a recently enacted naturalization provision, the remedy was by habeas corpus after the termination of the deportation proceedings and after a stay had been denied in those proceedings. United States ex rel. Walther v. District Director of Immigration and Naturalization, 2 Cir., 175 F.2d 693; Petition of Kavadias, 7 Cir., 177 F.2d 497. But as a general rule stays were not utilized, cf. Klig v. Watkins, D.C., 84 F.Supp. 486, and there ensued a race between the alien to gain citizenship and the Attorney General to deport him. If the alien was successful in forcing a final hearing and the granting of his naturalization petition, the deportation proceedings were completely nullified. To remedy this situation, the Congress incorporated \u00a7 27 in the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 1015, 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed., Supp. V) \u00a7 729(c). This section prohibited naturalization or the holding of final hearings on naturalization petitions where deportation proceedings were instituted 'under the provisions of this or any other Act.' The 1950 Act took effect immediately and contained no savings clause, although it introduced new grounds for deportation which were to be retroactively applied. See Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 74 S.Ct. 737, 98 L.Ed. 911. And in United States ex rel. Jankowski v. Shaughnessy, 2 Cir., 186 F.2d 580, the priority provision\u2014s 27\u2014was held to apply to naturalization petitions filed before the effective date of the Act, even though the deportation proceedings were commenced, as here, under the new statute.\n\n\n6\nSection 318 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 re-enacted \u00a7 27 in substantially the same form, retaining the language of its predecessor in suspending final hearings on naturalization where deportation proceedings were instituted under this or any other Act. But petitioner contends that this plain language does not apply to his case because Congress did not specifically exempt \u00a7 318 from the operation of the savings clause embodied in \u00a7 405(a), under which his inchoate right to citizenship is preserved.\n\n\n7\nIt is true that \u00a7 318 begins with the phrase 'Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405(b),' which at first glance might indicate that it was intended not to apply to \u00a7 405(a). But further analysis renders this position untenable. The same priority section had been inserted as an emergency provision in the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, and had been given immediate prospective and retroactive effect. It was carried forward almost verbatim as \u00a7 318 in the 1952 Act. And to make certain that it would apply to rights existing under petitions for naturalization, the Congress added to \u00a7 318 the phrase 'Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405(b),' referring to the only part of the savings clause which deals explicitly with the law applicable to naturalization petitions. The congressional purpose must have been to have \u00a7 318 supersede rights stemming from such petitions, for under any other interpretation its previous approach under the 1950 law is unexplainedly reversed and the 'notwithstanding' clause is rendered meaningless. It may be that the draftsmen could have been more exact in their language, since \u00a7 405(a), as well as \u00a7 405(b), embraces rights under pending petitions, see United States v. Menasche, supra. But we think their intent is plain enough.\n\n\n8\nPetitioner contends that this application of \u00a7 318 will have the result of affording more protection to pre-petition rights of the Menasche-type than to inchoate rights under a petition for naturalization itself, since the former are not embraced within \u00a7 405(b). But we do not believe \u00a7 318 differentiates between these steps in the process of naturalization. Each is but part of the whole process leading to citizenship and each is subject to the provisions of \u00a7 318.\n\n\n9\nNor can we accept petitioner's argument that Congress intended \u00a7 318 to apply only to deportation proceedings based on grounds existing under the prior law. In making this contention, petitioner gives away nothing and gains nothing. If the groups for deportation are the same under the prior law as under the new Act, then nothing in the new Act affects petitioner; it is clear that rights under the savings clause have not been infringed even if there is no specific exception. Only where something in the new law introduces a change, thereby affecting one's status under the old law, is the savings clause called into play. Only then is a specific exception to \u00a7 405 required. Thus, if petitioner's construction were to prevail, the 'notwithstanding' language in \u00a7 318 would be as meaningless as under the interpretation previously advanced and rejected. The 'notwithstanding' clause takes on meaning only when we assume that the new Act has made some change in the law to which the 'notwithstanding' statement is noting a specific exception. That is this case.4\n\n\n10\nThe role thus played by \u00a7 405(b) is in substantial accord with the operation of its predecessor, \u00a7 347(b) of the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1168, 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) \u00a7 747. It was pointed out in Menasche, supra, that \u00a7 347(b), with its two-year limitation, was considered to be a special limitation on the rights preserved by subsection (a) of that savings clause. The two-year period has been deleted in \u00a7 405(b), but the subsection remains a special limitation on the broad savings provision, bringing to bear the specific exceptions found in \u00a7 318 and other provisions of the new Act whenever the protection of \u00a7 405(a) is sought for rights connected with the naturalization process.5\n\n\n11\nIn our view, \u00a7 405[b] is the vehicle for applying each of these exceptions to the rights and liabilities emerging from naturalization proceedings under prior law and otherwise preserved by \u00a7 405(a). In using the 'notwithstanding' language in these sections, Congress clearly manifested its intent that certain policies should override the otherwise broad and pervasive principle of the savings clause. In United States v. Menasche, supra, we recognized the wide scope to be given the savings clause. We would be lax in our duty if we did not give recognition also to the congressional purpose to override the savings clause when other considerations were thought more compelling than the preservation of the status quo. If we are not to nullify this clear legislative purpose and render meaningless the 'notwithstanding' language of \u00a7 318 and the other sections, we must find for the Government and hold that \u00a7 318 bars petitioner's attempt to compel a hearing on his naturalization petition while the deportation preceeding is pending.\n\n\n12\nAffirmed.\n\n\n13\nMr. Justice HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n\n1\n The text of this provision, in material part, is as follows:\n'Sec. 318. * * * Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405(b), and except as provided in sections 327 and 328 no person shall be naturalized against whom there is outstanding a final finding of deportability pursuant to a warrant of arrest issued under the provisions of this or any other Act; and no petition for naturalization shall be finally heard by a naturalization court if there is pending against the petitioner a deportation proceeding pursuant to a warrant of arrest issued under the provisions of this or any other Act: * * *.'\n\n\n2\n It is assumed for the purposes of this proceeding that petitioner is deportable under \u00a7 241(a). See note 3, infra.\n\n\n3\n This is not to say that petitioner cannot challenge the authority of the Attorney General to deport him under \u00a7 241(a) of the 1952 Act. We express no opinion as to whether such a challenge, grounded on the savings clause or otherwise, might succeed if made in the deportation proceedings. Whether the question of deportability could be raised in a naturalization proceeding was expressly waived by the petitioner. See Petitioner's Brief, p. 7.\n\n\n4\n Petitioner's further argument, that a change in the punctuation of \u00a7 318 resulted in the application of the 'notwithstanding' clause to final findings of deportability but not to pending proceedings, must be rejected. When viewed against the purpose of the clause, the circumstances surrounding the controverted change, and the usual rules of proper punctuation, the contention is shown to be without substance.\n\n\n5\n Section 311 provides that the right to naturalization shall not be abridged because of race, sex or marriage, and, '(n)otwithstanding section 405(b), this section shall apply to any person where petition for naturalization shall hereafter be filed, or shall have been pending on the effective date of this Act.' 66 Stat. 239, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1422, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1422.\nSection 313(a) states: 'Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405(b), no person shall hereafter be naturalized' who engages in specified subversive activities or who is a member of described subversive organizations. 66 Stat. 240, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1424(a), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1424(a).\nSection 315(a) provides: 'Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405(b),' one who claims or has claimed his alienage and 'is or was' thereby relieved of service in the armed forces, 'shall be permanently ineligible to become a citizen.' 66 Stat. 242, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1426(a), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1426(a).\nSection 331(d) provides for the ending of enemy alien status and states: 'Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405(b), this subsection shall also apply to the case of any such alien whose petition for naturalization was filed prior to the effective date of this Act and which is still pending on that date.' 66 Stat. 252, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(d), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1442(d).\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"357 U.S. 493\n78 S.Ct. 1253\n2 L.Ed.2d 1514\nJoy JONES, Petitioner,v.UNITED STATES of America.\nNo. 331.\nArgued April 7, 8, 1958.\nDecided June 30, 1958.\n\nMr. Wesley R. Asinof, Atlanta, Ga., for petitioner.\nMr. Engene L. Grimm, for respondent.\nMr. Justice HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nAfter a trial without a jury in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, petitioner was found guilty of various violations of the federal liquor laws, stemming from and including the possession of an unregistered still. See 26 U.S.C. (Supp. V) \u00a7\u00a7 5601, 5216, 5008, 5681, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 5601, 5216, 5008, 5681. His claim is that some of the evidence used against him at the trial should have been suppressed because it was obtained by an unlawful search and seizure by federal officers, and that its admission vitiates his conviction. The importance of maintaining strict standards for the admissibility of evidence so challenged in the federal courts led us to grant certiorari. 355 U.S. 810, 78 S.Ct. 57, 2 L.Ed.2d 29.\n\n\n2\nFederal alcohol agents received information on April 30, 1956, that petitioner's farmhouse near Dawsonville, Georgia, was the site of an illicit distillery in current operation. Investigating this lead, the agents discovered spent mash, a product resulting from the distilling of alcohol out of mash, in a hollow behind petitioner's house. The running mash emerged from a concealed rubber hose which, when traced as far as was consistent with caution, led close to petitioner's home. On May 1, four federal agents and one state officer returned to this vicinity. The officers observed mash, still emerging from the hose, detected the distinctive odor of hot mash from the direction of the house, and heard coming from within the house the sounds of voices and of a blower burner, commonly used in that area to heat distilleries.\n\n\n3\nAt 2 a.m. on May 2, the officers abandoned their watch and returned to the nearby city of Gainesville. During the day, Federal Agent Langford obtained from the United States Commissioner there a daytime search warrant for petitioner's house on the basis of an affidavit describing what had been discovered and asserting the officer's belief that the house sheltered an illicit distillery. Late that afternoon, but still in daylight, the five officers resumed their surveillance of the house. Rather than execute the daytime warrant at once, they decided to make further observations to determine which parties were implicated in the operations and whether any vehicles were being used.\n\n\n4\nAbout 9 p.m., after darkness had set in, a truck entered petitioner's yard and retreated out of the officers' sight behind the house. Loud noises were heard, and when the truck shortly thereafter sought to regain the public road in front of the house, it became stuck in petitioner's driveway. The officers arrested the two men in the truck and seized what turned out to be 413 gallons of nontaxpaid liquor. At that time a passenger car carrying petitioner's wife and children drove into the yard. The wife rushed to the house and reached the doorway before the federal officers who were then advancing towards it. She sought to block entry by placing her arms across the door, and when informed by Langford of his identity as a federal officer, she demanded to see his search warrant. Langford said that a warrant was not required, and the officers brushed past Mrs. Jones into the house, seizing from the hands of her young boy a shotgun which he was brandishing in an apparent effort to prevent entry.\n\n\n5\nIn the house at that time, in addition to Mrs. Jones and the children, were petitioner's father and brother. The officers did not arrest any of them, but immediately engaged in a general search of the house. The evidence later admitted against petitioner at the trial, including a boiler, fuel burner, and 15 barrels, was seized in rear rooms and in the attic. Petitioner was arrested when he returned to his house about one hour after the search had been completed.\n\n\n6\nPetitioner moved before trial to suppress the use in evidence of the articles seized in his home. During the hearing on this motion, the Government conceded that by the time petitioner's house was searched the daytime search warrant had expired, and it disclaimed any intention on the part of the federal officers to execute it. Rather it urged that '* * * it is the reasonableness of the search which is under question.' Federal Agent Evans testified that he thought a nighttime search warrant could be dispensed with because '* * * the crime was being committed in our presence, at least I assumed we had probable cause for that.'1 And Agent Langford explained his position by stating: '* * * I thought we had sufficient evidence to go in the premises without a search warrant.'2 The court, in denying the motion to suppress, entered findings of fact and conclusions of law wherein it stated (245 F.2d 35):\n\n\n7\n'The Court finds that the facts and circumstances within the      knowledge of the officers were sufficient in themselves to      warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense was being committed and      therefore the Court finds that probable cause for the search      existed at the time the search was made.'\n\n\n8\nSince this was so, and since '* * * a cautious man (would have been warranted) in the belief that (petitioner) was guilty of the offense of operating an illicit distillery in his home * * *,' the court deemed the search reasonable, and hence justified, despite the failure of the officers to obtain a nighttime warrant, and despite their ability, under the circumstances, to have sought such a warrant before entering the house. In so holding, the District Court relied upon United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653. The Court of Appeals affirmed on the basis of the findings of the district judge. 245 F.2d 32.\n\n\n9\nAlthough it must be recognized that the basis of the two lower court decisions is not wholly free from ambiguity, a careful consideration of the record satisfies us that the search and seizure were considered to have been justified because the officers had probable cause to believe that petitioner's house contained contraband materials which were being utilized in the commission of a crime, and not necause the search and seizure were indicent to petitioner's arrest. So viewed the judgments below cannot be squared with the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States3 and with the past decisions of this Court.\n\n\n10\nIt is settled doctrine that probable cause for belief that certain articles subject to seizure are in a dwelling cannot of itself justify a search without a warrant. Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20, 33, 46 S.Ct. 4, 6, 70 L.Ed. 145;4 Taylor v. United States, 286 U.S. 1, 6 52 S.Ct. 466, 467, 76 L.Ed. 951. The decisions of this Court have time and again underscored the essential purpose of the Fourth Amendment to shield the citizen from unwarranted intrustions into his privacy. See, e.g., Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 14, 68 S.Ct. 367, 369, 92 L.Ed. 436; McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 455, 69 S.Ct. 191, 193, 93 L.Ed. 153; cf. Giordenello v. United States, 357 U.S. 480, 78 S.Ct. 1245. This purpose is realized by Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A., which implements the Fourth Amendment by requiring that an impartial magistrate determine from an affidavit showing probable cause whether information possessed by law-enforcement officers justifies the issuance of a search warrant. Were federal officers free to search without a warrant merely upon probable cause to believe that certain articles were within a home, the provisions of the Fourth Amendment would become empty phrases, and the protection it affords largely nullified.\n\n\n11\nThe facts of this case impressively bear out these observations, for it is difficult to imagine a more severe invasion of privacy than the nighttime intrusion into a private home that occurred in this instance. The Criminal Rules specifically deal with searches of this character by restricting nighttime warrants to situations where the affidavits upon which they are issued '* * * are positive that the property is * * * in the place to be searched * * *.' Rule 41(c). (Italics added.) This Rule is hardly compatible with a principle that a search without a warrant can be based merely upon probable cause.\n\n\n12\nThe case of United States v. Rabinowitz, supra, upon which the District Court relied, has no application here. There federal agents, without a search warrant, explored the office of the defendant and thereby obtained evidence used against him at trial. But immediately after entering the office and before their search, the agents executed a warrant they had previously obtained for the defendant's arrest. The Court stressed that the legality of the search was entirely dependent upon an initial valid arrest. 339 U.S. at page 60, 70 S.Ct. at page 432. The exceptions to the rule that a search must rest upon a search warrant have been jealously and carefully drawn, and search incident to a valid arrest is among them. See, e.g., United States v. Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48, 51, 72 S.Ct. 93, 95, 96 L.Ed. 59; Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879; Johnson v. United States, supra, 333 U.S. at pages 14\u201415, 68 S.Ct. at page 369. None of these exceptions obtains in this case.\n\n\n13\nThe Government, however, for the first time now maintains that the search and seizure were justifiable as incident to petitioner's lawful arrest. Its argument is: The federal agents involved in this search had authority under federal law to arrest without a warrant upon probable cause to believe that a person had committed a felony. From the record it is 'rational' to infer that the federal agents entered petitioner's house with the purpose of arresting him, upon probable cause to believe that he was guilty of a felony and that he was then in the house. Consequently, the agents' entry was justified and, once in the house, while searching for petitioner, they could properly seize all contraband material in plain sight. The fact that petitioner was not found should not vitiate the legality of the seizures.\n\n\n14\nThese contentions, if open to the Government here, would confront us with a grave constitutional question, namely, whether the forceful nighttime entry into a dwelling to arrest a person reasonably believed within, upon probable cause that he had committed a felony, under circumstances where no reason appears why an arrest warrant could not have been sought, is consistent with the Fourth Amendment. But we do not consider this issue fairly presented by this case, for the record fails to support he theory now advanced by the Government. The testimony of the federal officers makes clear beyond dispute that their purpose in entering was to search for distilling equipment, and not to arrest petitioner. See notes 1 and 2, supra, 78 S.Ct. 1255, 1256.5\n\n\n15\nSince the evidence obtained through this unlawful search was admitted at the trial, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed.\n\n\n16\nReversed.\n\n\n17\nMr. Justice BLACK concurs in the result.\n\n\n18\nMr. Justice CLARK, with whom Mr. Justice BURTON concurs, dissenting.\n\n\n19\nAlthough there are many ways to kill a cat, drowning remains the most favored. The Court applies that method to this conviction drowning it by watering down the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. By attributing to them a diluted meaning, the judgments of the District Court and the Court of Appeals are rendered insupportable.\n\n\n20\nThe District Court found that the officers in this moonshine liquor case received information that petitioner, previously known to them as a liquor law violator, was operating an illicit distillery in his home. In the course of an investigation the officers (1) found 'spent mash' flowing from a hose which was traced to within 75 yards of the house, (2) heard a 'blower burner' of the type generally used in illicit distilleries, (3) smelled the odor of hot mash coming from the house, and (4) heard the moving of heavy objects from within the house. These observations were gained over a two-day period. On the third day the officers returned with a daylight search warrant, but decided to resume surveillance instead of immediately executing the warrant. After dark, as one person left the house to walk up the road, the officers heard conversation, specifically, an inquiry as to whether 'they were ready for the truck to be brought to the house.' An empty truck then entered the yard and drove to the back door of the house, where a thumpting sound suggesting 'activity with heavy objects' was heard. The truck, heavily laden, became stuck on its attempt to leave the yard; its two occupants then were arrested, and its contents\u2014413 gallons of nontax paid liquor\u2014were seized. Thereafter, petitioner's wife and son, who had just arrived, attempted to bar the officers' entry into the house, telling them to wait until petitioner returned. The officers entered anyway, and in the course of a search, found the disputed evidence. The record reveals that petitioner was not found in the search of the premises, but was arrested when he returned later in the evening.\n\n\n21\nFrom these findings common sense would seem to dictate the conclusion that the officers, not believing the statement of petitioner's wife that he was not there, entered the house to find and arrest petitioner. It was his house, he was known as a prior offender, and it was he who was implicated by the tip which launched the investigation. The district judge, in fact, concluded that 'the officers had reasonable ground of suspicion supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant a cautious man in the belief that Roy Jones was guilty of the offense of operating an illicit distillery in his home * * *.' The Court, however, takes these findings and conclusions to mean that both the District Court and the Court of Appeals considered the search and seizure justified 'because the officers had probable cause to believe that petitioner's house contained contraband materials which were being utilized in the commission of a crime, and not because the search and seizure were incident to petitioner's arrest.'\n\n\n22\nIt is our duty, when the meaning of the findings is somewhat doubtful, to so construe them as to conform with and uphold the judgment. Cf. Larkin v. Upton, 1892, 144 U.S. 19, 21, 12 S.Ct. 614, 36 L.Ed. 330; Loring v. Frue, 1881, 104 U.S. 223, 224, 26 L.Ed. 713. This the Court has not done. The Court's construction is all the more surprising because it places the judgments below in direct conflict with an elementary rule of hornbook law, namely, that officers may not search a dwelling without a warrant 'notwithstanding facts unquestionably showing probable cause.' Agnello v. United States, 1925, 269 U.S. 20, 33, 46 S.Ct. 4, 6, 70 L.Ed. 145. I feel certain the four learned judges on the two lower courts were well acquainted with the Agnello rule, and that they used the words 'probable cause' as referring not ultimately to the search of the premises, but instead to the arrest of petitioner and any others violating the law within the house. This is borne out by the definition with which the trial judge introduced the crucial paragraph of his Conclusions of Law: 'Probable cause is reasonable ground of suspicion supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant a cautious man in the belief that the party is guilty of the offense with which he is charged.' Furthermore, the trial judge relied on United States v. Rabinowitz, 1950, 339 U.S. 56, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653, a case where the legality of a search hinged on the legality of an arrest. The majority, noting the judge's use of Rabinowitz, would have us believe that the case 'has no application here'; on the contrary, it would appear that the majority has overlooked the only reason for which the case was cited.\n\n\n23\nI submit that the officers had authority to enter the house, arrest any persons engaged in the illicit operation, and, not finding petitioner, arrest him upon his return to the scene. Under the law as I have always understood it, an officer, even over protest, may enter a house to make an arrest where he has probable cause to believe that a felony is being or has been committed and that the perpetrators are in the house. Mullaney v. United States, 9 Cir., 82 F.2d 638; Appell v. United States, 5 Cir., 29 F.2d 279; Mattus v. United States, 9 Cir., 11 F.2d 503; 1 Wharton, Criminal Procedure (10th ed.), \u00a7 51; Wilgus, Arrest Without a Warrant, 22 Mich.L.Rev. 541, 798, 800\u2014807. Cf. Taylor v. United States, 1932, 286 U.S. 1, 6, 52 S.Ct. 466, 467, 76 L.Ed. 951; Agnello v. United States, supra, 269 U.S. at page 30, 46 S.Ct. at page 5. There being probable cause here to believe that a felon was within the house, the entry of the officers was lawful, even though after a complete search the belief was found to be incorrect. Love v. United States, 4 Cir., 170 F.2d 32, 33. Such a circumstance 'cannot be distinguished on any reasonable basis from the search of the premises of an accused as an incident to the lawful arrest of his person * * *.' Martin v. United States, 4 Cir., 183 F.2d 436, 439.\n\n\n24\nSince the entry of petitioner's home was lawful, the officers had a right to seize the contraband property. The only test is the lawfulness of the officers' activity when they come upon the offending property. If the seizure follows a lawful entry to effect an arrest, as here, then it is valid. See Harris v. United States, 1947, 331 U.S. 145, 67 S.Ct. 1098, 91 L.Ed. 1399, seizure during lawful search incident to arrest for another crime; Steele v. United States, 1925, 267 U.S. 498, 45 S.Ct. 414, 69 L.Ed. 757, seizure during execution of warrant for different property.\n\n\n25\nI believe that these principles control here, and would, therefore, affirm.\n\n\n\n1\n This witness further testified:\n'Q. What crime did you see committed inside the house before you went inside to search the place? A. I didn't see any crime.\n'Q. What crime did you say was committed in your presence? A. The one I saw was the transporting of the whiskey out through his yard.\n'Q. Through his yard? A. Yes, sir.\n'Q. You stopped that truck, didn't you? A. Yes, sir.\n'Q. You arrested the occupants of that truck, did you not? A. Yes, sir.\n'Q. Neither one of the occupants of that truck fled into that house, did they? A. No, sir.\n'Q. So you had no knowledge that anyone else was even in the house, had you? A. If you mean by 'knowledge,' did I see anyone else inside the house, no, sir.'\n\n\n2\n On cross-examination, Langford testified: 'Q. Mrs. Jones did ask you not to come in, did she not? A. That is correct. Q. Mrs. Jones asked you, did she or not ask you to wait until her husband got there? A. I believe she did, yes.' These answers amplified his earlier testimony: 'Q. * * * Then you didn't wait until Mr. Jones, himself, came home, did you? A. I did not. Q. Yet they were his premises? A. That is correct.'\n\n\n3\n 'The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be sized.'\n\n\n4\n In Agnello the Court said: 'Save in certain cases as incident to arrest, there is no sanction in the decisions of the courts, federal or state, for the search of a private dwelling house without a warrant. Absence of any judicial approval is persuasive authority that it is unlawful. * * * Belief, however well founded, that an article sought is concealed in a dwelling house furnishes no justification for a search of that place without a warrant. And such searches are held unlawful notwithstanding facts unquestionably showing probable cause.' 269 U.S. at page 33, 46 S.Ct. at page 6.\n\n\n5\n We cannot accept the suggestion that the entry was justified since it was made to disarm petitioner's young son of the shotgun. The record plainly enough reveals that this was but a passing episode in the course of the entry, and that the officers immediately proceeded to a search of the entire house.\n\n\n","label":0}

{"text":"369 U.S. 506\n82 S.Ct. 884\n8 L.Ed.2d 70\nWillard CARNLEY, Petitioner,v.H. G. COCHRAN, Jr., Director of the Division of  Corrections, State of Florida.\nNo. 158.\nArgued Feb. 20 and 21, 1962.\nDecided April 30, 1962.\n\nHarold A. Ward, III, Winter Park, Fla., for petitioner.\nJames G. Mahorner, Asst. Atty. Gen., Tallahassee, Fla., for respondent, pro hac vice.\nMr. Justice BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe petitioner, who was not afforded the assistance of counsel for his defense at his trial, claims that, for this reason, his conviction by a jury in the Court of Record for Escambia County, Florida, deprived him of rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. He obtained a provisional writ of habeas corpus from the Florida Supreme Court on his petition asserting that claim. However, that court, on the petition, the respondent's return and the petitioner's reply\u2014but without any hearing\u2014discharged the writ. 123 So.2d 249. Since an important constitutional right is involved, we granted certiorari and appointed counsel to represent the petitioner in this Court. 366 U.S. 958, 81 S.Ct. 1927, 6 L.Ed.2d 1253, 368 U.S. 806, 82 S.Ct. 43.\n\n\n2\nThe assistance of counsel might well have materially aided the petitioner in coping with several aspects of the case. He was charged with the non-capital offenses of incestuous sexual intercourse with his 13-year-old daughter and, in a separate count relating to the same acts, fondling a minor child, that is, assault in a lewd, lascivious and indecent manner, upon a female child under the age of 14. At the time of trial two sets of Florida criminal statutes contained language reaching such behavior. Sections 741.22 and 800.04, Florida Statutes, 1959, F.S.A., were generally criminal provisions separately defining the two offenses of incest and assault in a lewd, lascivious, and indecent manner. In addition, both offenses were included within the later enacted Chapter 801 of the Florida Statutes\u2014Florida's so-called Child Molester Act\u2014if the victim was 14 years of age or younger.1 The Florida Supreme Court plainly conceived the petitioner's prosecution for both offenses as having been under the Child Molester Act. 123 So.2d at 250. While that is an obviously plausible view, a lawyer, but not a layman, might have perceived that because the Child Molester Act was invoked against the petitioner in respect of conduct elsewhere specifically defined as criminal, the 1954 decision of the Florida Supreme Court in Copeland v. State, 76 So.2d 137, raised doubts, under the Florida Constitution, of the validity of a prosecution based on the Act.2 The picture is further complicated by the fact that the Child Molester Act had included no reference to incest prior to an amendment made subsequent to the petitioner's alleged offense.3\n\n\n3\nEstablishing the basis of the petitioner's prosecution was vitally important for the protection of his rights. If the Child Molester Act was validly applied against the petitioner, counsel could have materially assisted him by invoking on his behalf the special provisions of that law governing the disposition of defendants charged under it. Sections 741.22 and 800.04 authorize only jail sentences. In contrast, the Child Molester Act empowers the sentencing judge in a proper case to commit the convicted defendant to a Florida state hospital for treatment and rehabilitation.4 That law also permits the accused to petition for a psychiatric or psychological examination for the purpose of assisting the court in the trial of the case.5\n\n\n4\nThere are thus present considerations of a sort often deemed sufficient to require the conclusion that a trial for crime without defense counsel did not measure up to the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g., Chewning v. Cunningham, 368 U.S. 443, 446\u2014447, 82 S.Ct. 498, 7 L.Ed.2d 442; Reynolds v. Cochran, 365 U.S. 525, 531\u2014532, 81 S.Ct. 723, 5 L.Ed.2d 754; McNeal v. Culver, 365 U.S. 109, 114\u2014116, 81 S.Ct. 413, 5 L.Ed.2d 445; Rice v. Olson, 324 U.S. 786, 789\u2014791, 65 S.Ct. 989, 89 L.Ed. 1367.\n\n\n5\nOther aspects of this record also support petitioner's claim of the unfairness of trying him without affording him the help of a lawyer. As must generally be the case, the trial judge could not effectively discharge the roles of both judge and defense counsel. Here the record shows that the trial judge made efforts to assist the petitioner, but there were important omissions in the guidance he gave. He did not fully apprise the petitioner of vital procedural rights of which laymen could not be expected to know but to which defense counsel doubtless would have called attention. The omissions are significant. See, e.g., Cash v. Culver, 358 U.S. 633, 637\u2014638, 79 S.Ct. 432, 3 L.Ed.2d 557; Gibbs v. Burke, 337 U.S. 773, 776\u2014778, 69 S.Ct. 1247, 93 L.Ed. 1686; Hudson v. North Carolina, 363 U.S. 697, 702\u2014703, 80 S.Ct. 1314, 4 L.Ed.2d 1500. Despite the allegation in respondent's return that 'the petitioners were carefully instructed by the trial court with regard to the rights guaranteed by both the Constitution of Florida and the Constitution of the United States6 and with regard to the procedures to be followed during the course of the trial,' it appears that, while petitioner was advised that he need not testify, he was not told what consequences might follow if he did testify. He chose to testify and his criminal record was brought out on his cross-examination. For defense lawyers, it is commonplace to weigh the risk to the accused of the revelation on cross-examination of a prior criminal record, when advising an accused whether to take the stand in his own behalf; for petitioner, the question had to be decided in ignorance of this important consideration. Nor does it appear that the trial judge advised the petitioner of his right to examine prospective jurors on voir dire, or of his right to submit proposed instructions to the jury, or of his right to object to the instructions that were given.\n\n\n6\nOther circumstances attending this case only serve to accentuate the unfairness of trial without counsel. Petitioner is illiterate. He did not interpose a single objection during the trial. The only two witnesses against him were his daughter and a 15-year-old son. Although both petitioner and his wife testified that they had experienced disciplinary problems with the children, and thus clearly revealed a possibly significant avenue for impeachment of the children's testimony, there was no cross-examination worthy of the name.7\n\n\n7\nWe hold that petitioner's case was one in which the assistance of counsel, unless intelligently and understandingly waived by him, was a right guaranteed him by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n8\nWe must therefore consider whether the petitioner did intelligently and understandingly waive the assistance of counsel. The record does not show that the trial judge offered and the petitioner declined counsel. Cf. Moore v. Michigan, 355 U.S. 155, 160\u2014161, 78 S.Ct. 191, 2 L.Ed.2d 167. Nevertheless, the State Supreme Court imputed to petitioner the waiver of the benefit of counsel on a ground stated in the court's opinion as follows: 'If the record shows that defendant did not have counsel * * *, it will be presumed that defendant waived the benefit of counsel * * *.' 123 So.2d at 251. This might mean that the petitioner could have suffered no constitutional deprivation if he had not formally requested counsel, and that failure to make such a request is to be presumed unless the record shows the contrary. But it is settled that where the assistance of counsel is a constitutional requisite, the right to be furnished counsel does not depend on a request.8 In McNeal v. Culver, supra, the petitioner's allegation that he had requested counsel was countered by a denial in the return that 'petitioner's constitutional rights were violated by the court's alleged refusal to appoint counsel in his behalf,' and the State Supreme Court noted that the record was silent as to any request. We held that when the Constitution grants protection against criminal proceedings without the assistance of counsel, counsel must be furnished 'whether or not the accused requested the appointment of counsel. Uveges v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 335 U.S. 437, 441, 69 S.Ct. 184, 185, 93 L.Ed. 127.' 365 U.S. at 111, note 1, 81 S.Ct. at 415. See Rice v. Olson, supra, 324 U.S. at 788, 65 S.Ct. at 990; Gibbs v. Burke, supra, 337 U.S. at 780, 69 S.Ct. at 1250.\n\n\n9\nHowever, the Florida Supreme Court may not have meant that the constitutional right to counsel depends upon a formal request. The court may have meant that from the very fact that no counsel was present, it would be assumed that the trial judge made an offer of counsel which the petitioner declined.9 Or, it may have meant that it would assume simply that petitioner knew of his right to counsel and was willing to forego it. Of course, the validity of such presumptions is immediately called in question because the accused has no way of protecting against them during his trial except by requesting counsel\u2014a formality upon which we have just said his right may not be made to depend. Nor is it an answer to say that he may counter such presumptions on collateral attack by showing\u2014if he can\u2014that he had not in fact agreed, or been willing, to be tried without counsel. To cast such a burden on the accused is wholly at war with the standard of proof of waiver of the right to counsel which we laid down in Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464\u2014465, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461:\n\n\n10\n'It has been pointed out that 'courts indulge every      reasonable presumption against waiver' of fundamental      constitutional rights and that we 'do not presume acquiescene      in the loss of fundamental rights.'\n\n\n11\n'The constitutional right of an accused to be represented by      counsel invokes, of itself, the protection of a trial court,      in which the accused\u2014whose life or liberty is at stake\u2014is      without counsel. This protecting duty imposes the serious and      weighty responsibility upon the trial judge of determining whether      there is an intelligent and competent waiver by the accused.      While an accused may waive the right to counsel, whether      there is a proper waiver should be clearly determined by the      trial court, and it would be fitting and appropriate for that      determination to appear upon the record.'\n\n\n12\nWe have held the principles declared in Johnson v. Zerbst equally applicable to asserted waivers of the right to counsel in state criminal proceedings. In Rice v. Olson, supra, the petitioner had pleaded guilty to a burglary charge. He did not claim that he had requested counsel, but alleged that he had not been advised of his right to the assistance of counsel and that he had not waived that right. In affirming the denial of relief, the State Supreme Court wrote that \"It is not necessary that there be a formal waiver; and a waiver will ordinarily be implied where accused appears without counsel and fails to request that counsel be assigned to him, particularly where accused voluntarily pleads guilty.\" We held that even when there had been a guilty plea such an implication, treated as a conclusive presumption, was 'inconsistent with our interpretation of the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment,' and that 'A defendant who pleads guilty is entitled to the benefit of counsel, and a request for counsel is not necessary.' 324 U.S. at 788, 65 S.Ct. at 990. However, we recognized in Rice v. Olson that, although the Fourteenth Amendment would not countenance any presumption of waiver from the appearance of the accused without counsel and the silence of the record as to a request, the entry of the guilty plea might have raised a fact issue as to whether the accused did not intelligently and understandingly waive his constitutional right. We held that a hearing was required since the facts were in dispute. In the present case, however, there was no guilty plea, and the return to the writ does not allege an affirmative waiver.10 Therefore, there is no disputed fact question requiring a hearing. Presuming waiver from a silent record is impermissible. The record must show, or there must be an allegation and evidence which show, that an accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the offer. Anything less is not waiver.\n\n\n13\nNeither Bute v. Illinois, 333 U.S. 640, 68 S.Ct. 763, 92 L.Ed. 986 nor Moore v. Michigan, supra, is in any way inconsistent with our holding and disposition here. In Bute, in which the petitioner pleaded guilty without having requested counsel, it was alleged that he had not been advised of his right of counsel. The Court held that there had been no denial of a constitutional right, but it expressly disclaimed a waiver rationale. It decided simply that the nature of the charge and the circumstances attending the reception of the guilty plea, as recited in that record, were not such as to call into play any constitutionally protected right to counsel. In Moore, the record showed clearly that the petitioner had expressly declined an offer of counsel by the trial judge, and we held that the accused had to show by a preponderance of the evidence that his acquiescence was not sufficiently understanding and intelligent to amount to an effective waiver. But no such burden can be imposed upon an accused unless the record\u2014or a hearing, where required\u2014reveals his affirmative acquiescence. Where, as in this case, the constitutional infirmity of trial without counsel is manifest, and there is not even an allegation, much less a showing, of affirmative waiver, the accused is entitled to relief from his unconstitutional conviction.\n\n\n14\nThe judgment of the Florida Supreme Court is reversed and the cause is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n15\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n16\nMr. Justice HARLAN concurs in the result.\n\n\n17\nMr. Justice FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\n\n18\nMr. Justice WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n19\nMr. Justice BLACK, concurring.\n\n\n20\nI concur in the Court's judgment of reversal and agree for the reasons stated in its opinion that petitioner was, even under the constitutional doctrine announced in Betts v. Brady, 316 U.S. 455, 62 S.Ct. 1252, 86 L.Ed. 1595, entitled to be represented by counsel. That case, decided in 1942, held that an indigent defendant charged with crime in a state court did not have a right under the Federal Constitution to be provided with counsel unless this Court could say 'by an appraisal of the totality of facts in a given case' that the refusal to provide counsel for the particular defendant constituted 'a denial of fundamental fairness, shocking to the universal sense of justice * * *.' Id., at 462, 62 S.Ct. at 1256. I dissented from the Court's denial of counsel and its announcement of what I considered to be such an impossibly vague and unpredictable standard. Among other grounds I thought the defendant in that case entitled to counsel because of my belief that the Fourteenth Amendment makes applicable to the States the Sixth Amendment's guarantee that 'In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall * * * have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.' That is still my view.\n\n\n21\nTwenty years' experience in the state and federal courts with the Betts v. Brady rule has demonstrated its basic failure as a constitutional guide. Indeed, it has served not to guide but to confuse the courts as to when a person prosecuted by a State for crime is entitled to a lawyer. Little more could be expected, however, of a standard which imposes upon courts nothing more than the perplexing responsibility of appointing lawyers for an accused when a trial judge believes that a failure to do so would be 'shocking to the universal sense of justice.' To be sure, in recent years this Court has been fairly consistent in assuring indigent defendants the right to counsel. As the years have gone on we have been compelled even under the Betts rule to reverse more and more state convictions either for new trial or for hearing to determine whether counsel had been erroneously denied1 a result that in my judgment is due to a growing recognition of the fact that our Bill of Rights is correct in assuming that no layman should be compelled to defend himself in a criminal prosecution. But all defendants who have been convicted of crime without the benefit of counsel cannot possibly bring their cases to us. And one need only look at the records of the right-to-counsel cases since Betts v. Brady in both state and federal courts to understand the capriciousness with which the 'shocking to the universal sense of justice' standard bestows its protection upon persons accused of crime.2 I think that now is the time to abandon this vague, fickle standard for determining the right to counsel of a person prosecuted for crime in a state court. We can do that by recognizing that defendants in state courts have by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment the same unequivocal right to counsel as defendants in federal courts have been held to have by virtue of the Sixth Amendment. Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461. For these and many other reasons, including those set out in McNeal v. Culver, 365 U.S. 109, 117, 81 S.Ct. 413, 5 L.Ed.2d 445, by Mr. Justice Douglas and joined in by Mr. Justice Brennan, I would overrule Betts v. Brady in this case. In so doing we would simply return to the holding of this Court in Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 68 69, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158, where it was stated with reference to prosecution for crime in the state courts that the '* * * right to be heard would be, in many cases, of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel.' I am aware that this statement was made in a capital case, but the Fourteenth Amendment protects life, liberty, and property and I would hold that defendants prosecuted for crime are entitled to counsel whether it is their life, their liberty, or their property which is at stake in a criminal prosecution.\n\n\n22\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, while joining the opinion of the Court, also join this opinion.\n\n\n23\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, concurring.\n\n\n24\nWhile I join the opinion of the Court and the separate opinion of Mr. Justice BLACK, I wish to add a word to the reasons Mr. Justice BRENNAN and I gave in McNeal v. Culver, 365 U.S. 109, 117\u2014119, 81 S.Ct. 413, 5 L.Ed.2d 445, for overruling Betts v. Brady, 316 U.S. 455, 62 S.Ct. 1252, 86 L.Ed. 1595.\n\n\n25\nPetitioner, an admitted illiterate,* was forced to try his case to a six-man jury. There is no record of the proceedings at which the jury was impaneled. There is nothing to show that petitioner was told of his right to challenge individual veniremen, or the panel as a whole, or that he challenged anyone for cause or exercised any of the six peremptory challenges granted him by Florida law. Fla.Stat., 1959, \u00a7 913.08, F.S.A.\n\n\n26\nIt is certain that he could have made no challenge to the panel as a whole. Such challenge must be in writing. Fla.Stats., 1959, \u00a7 913.01, F.S.A., and the Florida Supreme Court tells us he could not write. But even if he could, it is doubtful that he would have been able to show an improper method of selection or even discrimination, because he was confined for a lengthy period prior to trial, five months of which were alleged to have been spent in solitary confinement. He did not have an opportunity, therefore, to gather the factual evidence necessary to sustain a possible challenge to the panel. The Florida statute, moreover, explicitly requires that the written challenge specify the facts on which it is based. Ibid.\n\n\n27\nHad petitioner been able to write, and had he access to the facts, he still would not, in all probability, have been able to build a legal argument sufficient to challenge the panel. He is a man of low intelligence. Some of the grounds for challenging the panel that might have been invoked by petitioner turn on difficult questions of state law, as where it is alleged that the legislature has passed a special, or local, law providing for the summoning and impaneling of grand and petit jurors. Article III, \u00a7 20, of the Florida Constitution, F.S.A. prohibits such 'special' laws. It is not always clear, though, whether a particular law is 'special' or 'general.' See, e.g., Hysler v. State, 132 Fla. 200, 181 So. 350; 132 Fla. 209, 181 So. 354; State ex rel. Green v. Pearson, 153 Fla. 314, 14 So.2d 565. The sophisticated nature of the arguments necessary to attack a law as 'special' would almost always be beyond the comprehension of one unlearned in the law.\n\n\n28\nIn Florida, a plea of abatement is the usual manner of testing the legality of a jury list. In some cases, a proceeding in mandamus has been deemed a proper remedy, as where it is claimed that the county commissioners have erred in the manner in which they selected the panel. State ex rel. Jackson v. Jordan, 101 Fla. 616, 135 So. 138. Often a simple oral challenge to an individual juror can achieve just as much, as where an accused contends a venireman does not have the 'qualifications required by law.' Fla.Stat., 1959, \u00a7 913.03(1), F.S.A. Yet obviously an illiterate cannot be expected to know these niceties of criminal procedure.\n\n\n29\nAssuming that an accused does decide to challenge prospective veniremen, either peremptorily or for cause, he must then decide how to secure the maximum benefit from his peremptory challenges. Florida statutes provide at least 12 independent grounds for a challenge for cause. Fla.Stat., 1959, \u00a7 913.03, F.S.A. Ignorance of a ground for challenge is no defense. Denmark v. State, 43 Fla. 182, 31 So. 269; McNish v. State, 47 Fla. 69, 36 So. 176; Webster v. State, 47 Fla. 108, 36 So. 584. Objections to qualifications of jurors not raised at the trial will not be considered on appeal. McNish v. State, supra; Crosby v. State, 90 Fla. 381, 106 So. 741.\n\n\n30\nWhere the trial court excuses a juror on its own motion, the accused has a right to object. The objection must be timely made, and the grounds therefor clearly stated. It is too late to object once the juror has been excused. Ellis v. State, 25 Fla. 702, 6 So. 768. On appeal, the accused must be able to show that the action of the court was prejudicial, or constituted an abuse of discretion. Williams v. State, 45 Fla. 128, 34 So. 279; Peadon v. State, 46 Fla. 124, 35 So. 204.\n\n\n31\nThe special difficulties facing an accused in a jury trial do not end with challenges to the panel or individual jurors. Florida prohibits the trial judge from commenting on the weight of the evidence, Lester v. State, 37 Fla. 382, 20 So. 232; Leavine v. State, 109 Fla. 447, 147 So. 897; Seward v. State, Fla., 59 So.2d 529, or from expressing an opinion that the accused should be convicted, Wood v. State, 31 Fla. 221, 12 So. 539, lest he influence the jury in its decision. But if he did make such comment, and the accused took no exception, the error will be deemed waived on appeal (Surrency v. State, 48 Fla. 59, 37 So. 575; Smith v. State, 65 Fla. 56, 61 So. 120), except where the interests of justice would not be served. Kellum v. State 104 So.2d 99 (Fla.Ct.App.3d Dist.).\n\n\n32\nHearsay evidence takes on added importance in jury trials. It is excluded if prejudicial. Owens v. State, 65 Fla. 483, 62 So. 651; Alvarez v. State, 75 Fla. 286, 78 So. 272. But if admitted without objection, it is generally regarded as having been received by consent. Sims v. State, 59 Fla. 38, 52 So. 198. An objection after a question has been answered is sometimes held to come too late. Schley v. State, 48 Fla. 53, 37 So. 518; Williams v. State, 58 Fla. 138, 50 So. 749; Sims v. State, supra. Yet a motion to strike may achieve the same result. Dickens v. State, 50 Fla. 17, 38 So. 909. In a rapid-fire exchange of questions and answers by the prosecution and a witness, a defendant without the assistance of counsel will oftentime find himself helpless to object or even to conceive grounds on which an objection to hearsay will lie. Indeed, what constitutes hearsay is itself a difficult question, on which judges may not always agree. See, e.g., Royal v. State, 127 Fla. 320, 170 So. 450.\n\n\n33\nOnce the evidence is in, an accused in Florida has the right to have the jury instructed on the law of the case before any final arguments are made. 'The Judge's charge following immediately upon the conclusion of the evidence may enable the jury to obtain a clearer and more accurate conception of their duties in the particular case than if they were required to wait until after the argument of counsel to hear the law of the case from the judge.' Smithie v. State, 88 Fla. 70, 76, 101 So. 276, 278. This right is waived by a failure to take exception to the procedure adopted by the court. Defects in the instructions of the court will likewise be deemed waived, where the accused fails to make timely objection. White v. State, 122 So.2d 340 (Fla.Ct.App.2d Dist.); Williams v. State, Fla., 117 So.2d 473.\n\n\n34\nIntricate procedural rules are not restricted to criminal trials in Florida. Similar rules, equally as complex and confusing to the layman, may be found in the criminal statutes of the other States. I assume that they might not be applied with the same vigor against a layman defending himself, as they would against one represented by a lawyer. Yet even so, the rule of Betts v. Brady projected in a jury trial faces a layman with a labyrinth he can never understand nor negotiate.\n\n\n35\nAs a result, the jury system\u2014pride of the English-speaking world\u2014becomes a trap for the layman because he is utterly without ability to make it serve the ends of justice.\n\n\n\n1\n Fla.Stat., 1959, \u00a7 741.22, F.S.A.:\n'Punishment for incest.\u2014Persons within the degrees of consanguinity within which marriages are prohibited or declared by law to be incestuous and void, who intermarry or commit adultery or fornication with each other, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison not exceeding twenty years, or in the county jail not exceeding one year.'\nFla.Stat., 1959, \u00a7 800.04, F.S.A.:\n'Lewd, lascivious or indecent assault or act upon or in presence of child.\u2014Any person who shall handle, fondle or make an assault upon any male or female child under the age of fourteen years in a lewd, lascivious or indecent manner, or who shall knowingly commit any lewd or lascivious act in the presence of such child, without intent to commit rape where such child is female, shall be deemed guilty of a felony and punished by imprisonment in the state prison or county jail for not more than ten years.'\nFla.Stat., 1959, \u00a7 801.02, F.S.A.:\n'Definitions.\u2014An offense under the provisions of this chapter shall include attempted rape, sodomy, attempted sodomy, crimes against nature, attempted crimes against nature, lewd and lascivious behavior, incest and attempted incest, assault (when a sexual act is completed or attempted) and assault and battery (when a sexual act is completed or attempted), when said acts are committed against, to, or with a person fourteen years of age or under.'\n\n\n2\n In the Copeland case, supra, the Florida Supreme Court held that the inclusion of rape in the Child Molester Act\u2014with its attendant alteration in the consequences of that offense when committed against a child of 14 or younger\u2014ran afoul of the State Constitution because the Act embraced 11 distinct crimes separately dealt with in other statutes, because the Act failed to set forth at length the general rape provisions which were pro tanto amended, and because the title of the Act failed to give notice that the consequences of rape had been changed. But see Buchanan v.

When, as provided for in this law, there shall have been created and established a Florida research and treatment center then the trial judge shall, instead of committing a person to the Florida state hospital, commit such person instead to the Florida research and treatment center. In any such case the court may, in its discretion, stay further criminal proceedings or defer the imposition of sentence pending the discharge of such person from further treatment in accordance with the procedure as outlined in this chapter.'\nFla.Stat., 1959, \u00a7 801.08, %.f.s.a.\/:\n'Execution of judgment may be suspended; probation; requirements.\u2014\n'(1) The trial judge under whose jurisdiction a conviction is obtained may suspend the execution of judgment and place the defendant upon probation.\n'(2) The trial court placing a defendant on probation may at any time revoke the order placing such defendant on probation and impose such sentence or commitment as might have been imposed at the time of conviction.\n'(3) No defendant shall be placed on probation or continue on probation until the court is satisfied that the defendant will take regular psychiatric, psychotherapeutic or counseling help, and the individual helping the defendant shall make written reports at intervals of not more than six months to the court and the probation officer in charge of the case.

The court may, of its own initiative, or upon petition of an interested person, order such examination and report as heretofore set out.'\n\n\n6\n Emphasis in original.\n\n\n7\n The wife testified: 'We tried to be firm with them, but it seemed like the more firm we got, these two older kids, they couldn't stand the pressure, so they would, every time that their Daddy would get after them or something or other about some of their doings, well, that oldest boy would say, 'Well, Daddy, you will sure regret it. I will get even with you one way or the other,' and also the girl would get mad and flirtified and she would almost have the same opinion.'\nThe entire cross-examination of both witnesses by petitioner and by his wife, who was a codefendant, is as follows:\n'CROSS EXAMINATION BY MR. WILLARD CARNLEY:\n'Q. Carol Jean, you say your mother, she went and made arrangements to get the casket for your sister?\n'A. Yes.\n'Q. You are right sure now that she did?\n'A. I am sure.\n'Q. Well, I will tell the Court, my wife was out at Mr. Joe Gayfer's house\u2014\n'THE COURT: Wait a minute, sir, you are testifying. You will have a chance to testify when the State rests. Any questions you wish to ask your daughter, you are welcome to do it.\n'CROSS EXAMINATION BY MRS. PEARL CARNLEY:\n'Q. Carol Jean, don't you recall after you got age of maturity that Mother tried to tell you right from wrong and always teach you right from wrong?\n'A. Yes, you have taught me right from wrong.\n'THEREUPON the witness was excused.\n'CROSS EXAMINATION BY MRS. CARNLEY:\n'Q. J.W., at this period of time, did you realize whenever we was up there at Century of your Dad's sickness from the time we moved up there until it was springtime, and after he was sick from his stomach that he taken a serious attack down by reason of his employment?\n'A. Yes, I realize he said he was sick. He was supposed to be sick. I know that.\n'THEREUPON the witness was excused.'\n\n\n8\n For this reason, there is no occasion to hold a hearing in this case to settle the fact issue raised by the petition and return as to whether the petitioner requested counsel.\n\n\n9\n Or that the trial judge was justified in believing that the accused knew perfectly well of his right to counsel, and that it was unnecessary to make an explicit offer and to secure to accused's rejection of the offer.\n\n\n10\n Petitioner's allegation that he requested counsel is, obviously, tantamount to a denial of waiver. The return's denial of a request is not, however, for reasons already canvassed, the equivalent of an allegation of waiver.\nThe return alleged that the trial judge instructed petitioner as to his constitutional rights, but this allegation claimed support in the transcript, inspection of which reveals no instruction as to any constitutional right except the right not to testify.\n\n\n1\n Chewning v.

Apparently classifying the conduct of a defense to a felony charge as one of the 'commonplace things of life,' the court concluded there was no showing petitioner or his wife 'suffered in the slightest from lack of intelligence.' 123 So.2d 249, 251.

{"text":"384 U.S. 251\n86 S.Ct. 1416\n16 L.Ed.2d 510\nUNITED STATES, Appellant,v.Ben BLUE.\nNo. 531.\nArgued April 21, 1966.\nDecided May 23, 1966.\n\nSolicitor Gen. Thurgood Marshall, for appellant.\nErnest R. Mortenson, Pasadena, Cal., for appellee.\nMr. Justice HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nIn 1962 the appellee, Ben Blue, was informed by the Internal Revenue Service that he might be criminally prosecuted for violation of the federal income tax laws. The following year the Service made jeopardy assessments against Blue, his wife, and his wholly owned corporation for tax liability for the years 1958 to 1960 inclusive; the known assets of all three were seized and tax liens recorded. Internal Revenue Code of 1954, \u00a7\u00a7 6321\u20146323, 6331, 6861. Statutory notices were then issued giving Blue 90 days within which to file petitions if he wished to contest the proposed deficiencies in the Tax Court, I.R.C. \u00a7 6213, and Blue filed petitions setting forth his position and alleging errors in the Commissioner's determination of deficiencies. More than a year later the Government initiated the present criminal case by a six-count indictment charging Blue with wilfully attempting to evade personal income taxes for the years 1958 through 1960 and with filing false returns for his corporation during the same years. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7201, 7206(1).\n\n\n2\nBlue filed a pretrial motion seeking dismissal of the indictment on several grounds. After a hearing the District Court granted the motion. The court stated orally that because of the jeopardy assessment and Tax Court proceeding Blue 'has been compelled and will be compelled to come forward on the same matters as are concerned in this criminal case, to testify against himself * * *.'1 The Government filed a notice of appeal and the case was docketed in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Determining that the District Court had sustained a 'motion in bar, when the defendant has not been put in jeopardy' so that a direct appeal lay to this Court,2 the Court of Appeals certified the case to us, 350 F.2d 267, and we postponed jurisdiction, 382 U.S. 971, 86 S.Ct. 534, 15 L.Ed.2d 463. We agree that this Court has jurisdiction over the appeal and, on the merits, reverse the decision of the District Court.\n\n\n3\nSince Blue had not yet been brought to trial and put in jeopardy when dismissal occurred, see United States v. Celestine, 215 U.S. 278, 283, 30 S.Ct. 93, 94, 54 L.Ed. 195, our jurisdiction under the statute is secure if the motion sustained by the District Court was a motion in bar. See, supra, n. 2. This in turn depends on 'the effect of the ruling sought to be reviewed,' United States v. Hark, 320 U.S. 531, 536, 64 S.Ct. 359, 361, 88 L.Ed. 290, and not on how the pleading is styled or on whether it is ultimately sustained on appeal. Like the Court of Appeals, we take the dismissal in this case as a ruling that absent reversal on review future prosecution of Blue on the pending counts is forever barred. While there are slight ambiguities in language, the District Court's dismissal was grounded in what it found to be past compulsory self-incrimination and in its apparent belief that this mischief could not be undone save by turning back the clock through ending the prosecution.\n\n\n4\nBecause the dismissal by its own force would 'end the cause and exculpate the defendant,' United States v. Hark, 320 U.S., at 536, 64 S.Ct. at 362, rather than merely abate the prosecution on account of some normally curable defect, one requisite of a motion in bar is met. Whether it is a further requisite that the motion introduce 'new matter' in the fashion of a plea by way of confession and avoidance need not here be decided. See United States v. Mersky, 361 U.S. 431, 441, 453, 80 S.Ct. 459, 465, 474, 4 L.Ed.2d 423 (separate opinions disagreeing on this point). For in this instance Blue unquestionably relied on new matter in alleging self-incrimination, so the motion qualifies even under the more stringent definition. Thus under either view of a motion in bar taken in Mersky, this case qualifies for direct review. Our conclusion on the jurisdictional issue is further supported by two analogous decisions of this Court treating claims of statutory immunity as pleas in bar which permitted direct appeal. United States v. Hoffman, 335 U.S. 77, 68 S.Ct. 1413, 92 L.Ed. 1830; United States v. Monia, 317 U.S. 424, 63 S.Ct. 409, 87 L.Ed. 376.\n\n\n5\nOn the merits of the case, we do not believe that the District Court should have dismissed the indictment. The Government has argued that the statements made by Blue in his Tax Court petitions were no more than successive denials of the alleged underpayments and do not constitute incriminating evidence. The Government has also intimated that by merely providing the occasion for the filing of Blue's petitions in fulfilling its statutory duty to make jeopardy assessments and send deficiency notices, it ought not be regarded as compelling the taxpayer to incriminate himself within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. There is no need, however, to consider these or other contentions that may point in the same direction.\n\n\n6\nEven if we assume that the Government did acquire incriminating evidence in violation of the Fifth Amendment, Blue would at most be entitled to suppress the evidence and its fruits if they were sought to be used against him at trial.3 While the general common-law practice is to admit evidence despite its illegal origins, this Court in a number of areas has recognized or developed exclusionary rules where evidence has been gained in violation of the accused's rights under the Constitution, federal statutes, or federal rules of procedure. Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652; Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U.S. 534, 81 S.Ct. 735, 5 L.Ed.2d 760; Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081; Nardone v. United States, 308 U.S. 338, 60 S.Ct. 266, 84 L.Ed. 307; Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, 77 S.Ct. 1356, 1 L.Ed.2d 1479. Our numerous precedents ordering the exclusion of such illegally obtained evidence assume implicitly that the remedy does not extend to barring the prosecution altogether. So drastic a step might advance marginally some of the ends served by exclusionary rules, but it would also increase to an intolerable degree interference with the public interest in having the guilty brought to book.\n\n\n7\nWe remand this case to the District Court to proceed on the merits, leaving Blue free to pursue his Fifth Amendment claim through motions to suppress and objections to evidence. It is not entirely clear from Blue's brief and argument whether he seeks to sustain the dismissal below on other grounds that the District Court did not accept. See, supra, n. 1. Putting to one side jurisdictional difficulties this course might encounter under the direct-review statute,4 we believe it is fairer to all to regard no other grounds as presented, thus reserving to Blue the opportunity to articulate them plainly and support them by the record.\n\n\n8\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n1\n The court stated that it based the dismissal 'on that ground alone.' It rejected a claim that the seizure of property and recording of tax liens had prevented Blue from preparing an adequate defense by depleting his resources. It did not expressly consider Blue's claim that there is an administrative practice of making no assessments in advance of criminal proceedings and that failure to extend the policy to him was a denial of due process.\n\n\n2\n 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731 (1964 ed.) provides in part:\n'An appeal may be taken by and on behalf of the United States from the district courts direct to the Supreme Court of the United States in all criminal cases in the following instances:\n'From the decision or judgment sustaining a motion in bar, when the defendant has not been put n jeopardy.\n'If an appeal shall be taken pursuant to this section to any court of appeals, which, in the opinion of such court, should have been taken directly to the Supreme Court of the United States, such court shall certify the case to the Supreme Court of the United States, which shall thereupon have jurisdiction to hear and determine the case to the same extent as if an appeal had been taken directly to that Court.'\n\n\n3\n It does not seem to be contended that tainted evidence was presented to the grand jury; but in any event our precedents indicate this would not be a basis for abating the prosecution pending a new indictment, let alone barring it altogether. See Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 76 S.Ct. 406, 100 L.Ed. 397; Lawn v. United States, 355 U.S. 339, 78 S.Ct. 311, 2 L.Ed.2d 321; 8 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2184a, at 40 (McNaughton rev. 1961).\n\n\n4\n See Stern & Gressman, Supreme Court Practice \u00a7 2\u201411, at 31 33 (1962); Friedenthal, Government Appeals in Federal Criminal Cases, 12 Stan.L.Rev. 71, 97\u2014100 (1959).\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"414 U.S. 51\n94 S.Ct. 303\n38 L.Ed.2d 260\nStanley T. KUSPER, Jr., et al., Appellants,v.Harriet G. PONTIKES.\nNo. 71\u20141631.\nArgued Oct. 9, 1973.\nDecided Nov. 19, 1973.\n\nSyllabus\nAppellee, a qualified Chicago voter who voted in a February 1971 Republican primary involving nominations for municipal officers, challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 7\u201443(d) of the Illinois Election Code, under which she was barred from voting in a March 1972 Democratic primary. Section 7\u201443(d) prohibits a person from voting in the primary election of a political party if he has voted in the primary of any other party within the preceding 23 months, an exception being made if the primary is of a 'political party within a city . . . only.' Appellants contended, inter alia, that the three-judge District Court, which held the three-judge District should have abstained because the state courts might have found the statutory exception applicable to the 1971 primary. Held:\n1. The District Court did not err in declining to abstain from making a constitutional ruling in view of an Illinois Supreme Court adjudication confining the statutory exception to political parties entitled to nominate only for city offices and making it inapplicable to the Democratic and Republican parties. Appellee is thus not relieved of the bar of the 23-month rule. Pp. 53\u201456.\n2. Section 7\u201443(d) unconstitutionally infringes upon the right of free political association protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments by 'locking' the voter in his pre-existing party affiliation for a substantial period of time following his participation in any primary election, and the State's legitimate interest in preventing party 'raiding' cannot justify the substantial restraint of the 23-month rule. Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U.S. 752, 93 S.Ct. 1245, 36 L.Ed.2d 1, distinguished. Pp. 56\u201461.\n345 F.Supp. 1104, affirmed.\nAldus S. Mitchell, Jr., Chicago, Ill., for appellants.\nRay Jeffrey Cohen, Chicago, Ill., for appellee.\nMr. Justice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nUnder \u00a7 7\u201443(d) of the Illinois Election Code, a person is prohibited from voting in the primary election of a political party if he has voted in the primary of any other party within the preceding 23 months.1 Appellee, Harriet G. Pontikes, is a qualified Chicago voter who voted in a Republican primary in February 1971;2 she wanted to vote in a March 1972 Democratic primary, but was barred from doing so by this 23-month rule.3 She filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging that \u00a7 7\u201443(d) unconstitutionally abridged her freedom to associate with the political party of her choice by depriving her of the opportunity to vote in the Democratic primary. A statutory three-judge court was convened,4 and held, one judge dissenting, that the 23-month rule is unconstitutional. 345 F.Supp. 1104.5 We noted probable judiction of this appeal from that judgment. 411 U.S. 915, 93 S.Ct. 1540, 36 L.Ed.2d 306.6\n\n\n2\n* At the outset, we are met by the appellants'7 argument that the District Court should have abstained from adjudicating the constitutionality of the 23-month rule. They base this argument upon that portion of \u00a7 7\u201443(d) which provides that:\n\n\n3\n'(P)articipation by a primary elector in a primary of a      political party which, under the provisions of Section 7\u20142 of      this Article, is a political party within a city, village or incorporated town or town only and      entitled hereunder to make nominations of candidates for      city, village or incorporated town or town offices only, and      for no other office or offices, shall not disqualify such      primary elector from participating in other primaries of his      party . . ..' Ill.Rev.Stat., c. 46, \u00a7 7\u201443(d).\n\n\n4\nThe appellants note that the February 1971 Republican primary election in which Mrs. Pontikes voted involved only nominations for the offices of mayor, city clerk, and city treasurer of the city of Chicago. They claim that the state courts might interpret this 1971 primary to have been one of a 'political party within a city . . . only,' and thus outside the purview of the 23-month rule.\n\n\n5\nAs we stated in Lake Carriers' Assn. v. MacMullan, 406 U.S. 498, 509, 92 S.Ct. 1749, 1756, 32 L.Ed.2d 257:\n\n\n6\n'Abstention is a 'judge-made doctrine . . ., first fashioned      in 1941 in Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496      (61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971), (that) sanctions . . . escape      (from immediate decision) only in narrowly limited 'special      circumstances,' Propper v. Clark, 337 U.S. 472, 492 (69 S.Ct.      1333, 1344, 93 L.Ed. 1480),' Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241,      248 (88 S.Ct. 391, 395, 19 L.Ed.2d 444) (1967), justifying      'the delay and expense to which application of the abstention      doctrine inevitably gives rise.' England v. (Louisiana State      Board of) Medical Examiners, 375 U.S. 411, 418 (84 S.Ct. 461,      466, 11 L.Ed.2d 440) (1964).'8\n\n\n7\nThe paradigm of the 'special circumstances' that make abstention appropriate is a case where the challenged state statute is susceptible of a construction by the state judiciary that would avoid or modify the necessity of reaching a federal constitutional question. Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 249, 88 S.Ct. 391, 396, 19 L.Ed.2d 444; Harrison v. NAACP, 360 U.S. 167, 176\u2014177, 79 S.Ct. 1025, 1030, 3 L.Ed.2d 1152. Abstention in such circumstances not only serves to minimize federal-state friction, but also avoids premature and perhaps unnecessary constitutional adjudication. Harman v. Forssenius, 380 U.S. 528, 534, 85 S.Ct. 1177, 1181, 14 L.Ed.2d 50. But the doctrine of abstention 'contemplates that deference to state court adjudication only be made where the issue of state law is uncertain.' Ibid., 85 S.Ct., at 1182. Where, on the other hand, it cannot be fairly concluded that the underlying state statute is susceptible of an interpretation that might avoid the necessity for constitutional adjudication, abstention would amount to shirking the solemn responsibility of the federal courts to 'guard, enforce, and protect every right granted or secured by the constitution of the United States,' Robb v. Connolly, 111 U.S. 624, 637, 4 S.Ct. 544, 551, 28 L.Ed. 542.\n\n\n8\nWe think that the Illinois statute involved in this case is not fairly susceptible of a reading that would avoid the necessity of constitutional adjudication. The appellants' argument\u2014that the February 1971 Chicago Republican primary might be considered that of a 'political party within a city . . . only'\u2014is foreclosed by the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court in Faherty v. Board of Election Comm'rs, 5 Ill.2d 519, 126 N.E.2d 235. That decision made it clear that the kind of 'local' primaries that are outside the scope of \u00a7 7\u201443(d) are simply those of \"purely city . . . political part(ies)\"\u2014those parties entitled, under \u00a7 7\u20142 of the Illinois Election Code, to make nominations for city offices only. Id., at 524, 126 N.E.2d, at 238.9\n\n\n9\nSince both the Democratic and Republican parties are, of course, entitled in Illinois to make nominations not only for city offices, but for congressional, state, and county offices as well, the Faherty court held that they were not within the statutory definition of 'city' parties. It follows then, that despite the fact that the February 1971 Republican primary in which the appellee voted involved only nominations for offices within the city of Chicago, Mrs. Pontikes was still clearly barred by the 23-month rule from voting in the March 1972 Democratic primary.10 The District Court was thus wholly justified in declining to abstain from deciding the constitutional validity of the 23-month rule, and it is to that issue that we now turn.\n\nII\n\n10\nThere can no longer be any doubt that freedom to associate with others for the common advancement of political beliefs and ideas is a form of 'orderly group activity' protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 430, 8o S.Ct. 328, 336, 9 L.Ed.2d 405; Bates v. Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516, 522\u2014523, 80 S.Ct. 412, 416, 4 L.Ed.2d 480; NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 460\u2014461, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 1171, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488. The right to associate with the political party of one's choice is an integral part of this basic constitutional freedom. Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23, 30, 89 S.Ct. 5, 10, 21 L.Ed.2d 24. Cf. United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258, 88 S.Ct. 419, 19 L.Ed.2d 508.\n\n\n11\nTo be sure, administration of the electoral process is a matter that the Constitution largely entrusts to the States.11 But, in exercising their powers of supervision over elections and in setting qualifications for voters, the States may not infringe upon basic constitutional protections. See, e.g., Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 92 S.Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274; Kramer v. Union School District, 395 U.S. 621, 89 S.Ct. 1886, 23 L.Ed.2d 583; Carrington v. Rash, 380 U.S. 89, 85 S.Ct. 775, 13 L.Ed.2d 675. As the Court made clear in Williams v. Rhodes, supra, unduly restrictive state election laws may so impinge upon freedom of association as to run afoul of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. 393 U.S., at 30, 89 S.Ct., at 10. And see id., at 35 41, 89 S.Ct., at 12\u201415 (Douglas, J., concurring); id., at 41\u201448, 89 S.Ct., at 15\u201419 (Harlan, J., concurring).\n\n\n12\nThere can be little doubt that \u00a7 7\u201443(d) substantially restricts an Illinois voter's freedom to change his political party affiliation. One who wishes to change his party registration must wait almost two years before his choice will be given effect. Moreover, he is forced to forgo participation in any primary elections occurring within the statutory 23-month hiatus. The effect of the Illinois statute is thus to 'lock' the voter into his pre-existing party affiliation for a substantial period of time following participation in any primary election, and each succeeding primary vote extends this period of confinement.\n\n\n13\nThe 23-month rule does not, of course, deprive those in the appellee's position of all opportunities to associate with the political party of their choice. But neither did the state attempts to compel disclosure of NAACP membership lists in Bates v. Little Rock and NAACP v. Alabama work a total restriction upon the freedom of the organization's members to associate with each other. Rather, the Court found in those cases that the statutes under attack constituted a 'substantial restraint'12 and a 'significant interference'13 with the exercise of the constitutionally protected right of free association.\n\n\n14\nThe same is true of \u00a7 7\u201443(d). While the Illinois statute did not absolutely preclude Mrs. Pontikes from associating with the Democratic party, it did absolutely preclude her from voting in that party's 1972 primary election. Under our political system, a basic function of a political party is to select the candidates for public office to be offered to the voters at general elections. A prime objective of most voters in associating themselves with a particular party must surely be to gain a voice in that selection process. By preventing the appellee from participating at all in Democratic primary elections during the statutory period, the Illinois statute deprived her of any voice in choosing the party's candidates, and thus substantially abridged her ability to associate effectively with the party of her choice.\n\nIII\n\n15\nAs our past decisions have made clear, a significant encroachment upon associational freedom cannot be justified upon a mere showing of a legitimate state interest. Bates v. Little Rock, supra, 361 U.S., at 524, 80 S.Ct., at 417; NAACP v. Alabama, supra, 357 U.S., at 463, 78 S.Ct., at 1172. For even when pursuing a legitimate interest, a State may not choose means that unnecessarily restrict constitutionally protected liberty. Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S., at 343, 92 S.Ct., at 1003. 'Precision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms.' NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S., at 438, 83 S.Ct., at 340. If the State has open to it a less drastic way of satisfying its legitimate interests, it may not choose a legislative scheme that broadly stifles the exercise of fundamental personal liberties. Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 488, 81 S.Ct. 247, 252, 5 L.Ed.2d 231.\n\n\n16\nThe appellants here urge that the 23-month rule serves the purpose of preventing 'raiding'\u2014the practice whereby voters in sympathy with one party vote in another's primary in order to distort that primary's results. It is said that our decision in Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U.S. 752, 93 S.Ct. 1245, 36 L.Ed.2d 1, recognized the state interest in inhibiting 'raiding,' and upheld the constitutional validity of legislation restricting a voter's freedom to change parties, enacted as a means of serving that interest.\n\n\n17\nIt is true, of course, that the Court found no constitutional infirmity in the New York delayed-enrollment statute14 under review in Rosario. That law required a voter to enroll in the party of his choice at least 30 days before a general election in order to be eligible to vote in the next party primary, and thus prevented a change in party affiliation during the approximately 11 months between the deadline and the primary election.15 It is also true that the Court recognized in Rosario that a State may have a legitimate interest in seeking to curtail 'raiding,' since that practice may affect the integrity of the electoral process. Id., at 761, 93 S.Ct., at 1251. But it does not follow from Rosario that the Illinois statutory procedures also pass muster under the Fourteenth Amendment, for the Illinois Election Code differs from the New York delayed-enrollment law in a number of important respects.\n\n\n18\nThe New York statute at issue in Rosario did not prevent voters from participating in the party primary of their choice; it merely imposed a time limit on enrollment. Under the New York law, a person who wanted to vote in a different party primary every year was not precluded from doing so; he had only to meet the requirement of declaring his party allegiance 30 days before the preceding general election. The New York law did not have the consequence of 'locking' a voter into an unwanted party affiliation from one election to the next; any such confinement was merely the result of the elector's voluntary failure to take timely measures to enroll. Id., at 757\u2014759, 93 S.Ct., at 1249. The Court therefore concluded that the New York delayed-enrollment law did not prevent voters 'from associating with the political party of their choice.' Id., at 762, 93 S.Ct., at 1252. And see id., at 758 and n. 8, 93 S.Ct., at 1250.\n\n\n19\nThe basic difference in the Illinois law is obvious. Since the appellee here voted in the 1971 Republican primary, the state law absolutely precluded her from participating in the 1972 Democratic primary. Unlike the petitioners in Rosario, whose disenfranchisement was caused by their own failure to take timely measures to enroll, there was no action that Mrs. Pontikes could have taken to make herself eligible to vote in the 1972 Democratic primary.16 The Illinois law, unlike that of New York, thus 'locks' voters into a pre-existing party affiliation from one primary to the next, and the only way to break the 'lock' is to forgo voting in any primary for a period of almost two years.\n\n\n20\nIn other words, while the Court held in Rosario that the New York delayedenrollment scheme did not prevent voters from exercising their constitutional freedom to associate with the political party of their choice, the Illinois 23-month rule clearly does just that. It follows that the legitimate interest of Illinois in preventing 'raiding' cannot justify the device it has chosen to effect its goal. For that device conspicuously infringes upon basic constitutional liberty. Far from supporting the validity of the Illinois legislation, the Court's decision in Rosario suggests that the asserted state interest can be attained by 'less drastic means,' which do not unnecessarily burden the exercise of constitutionally protected activity.\n\n\n21\nWe conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 7\u201443(d) of the Illinois Election Code unconstitutionally infringes upon the right of free political association protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The judgment of the District Court is accordingly affirmed.\n\n\n22\nAffirmed.\n\n\n23\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE concurs in the result.\n\n\n24\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN, dissenting.\n\n\n25\nThe deprivation Mrs. Pontikes claims to have suffered, and which the Court today enshrouds with the mantle of unconstitutionality, is that she has been restrained by the Illinois statute from voting in one primary election of one party in the relatively minor context of a personal desire to undo an established party affiliation. Apart from this meager restraint, appellee Pontikes is fully free to associate with the party of her varying choice. She is, and has been, completely free to vote as she chooses in any general election. And she was free to vote in the primary of the party with which she had affiliated and voted in the preceding primary.\n\n\n26\nIt is important, I think\u2014and deserving of repeated emphasis to note that this very limited statutory restriction on the appellee's exercise of her franchise is triggered solely by her personal and voluntary decision. This being so, the Court's conclusion seems to me to dilute an important First Amendment concept the vitality of which, in the long run, necessarily will suffer from strained and artificial applications of this kind. The mere fact that a state statute lightly brushes upon the right to vote and the right of association, important as these are, should not automatically result in invalidation. Prior case law does not require a conclusion of invalidity where, as here, the intrusion is so minor. See McDonald v. Board of Election Comm'rs, 394 U.S. 802, 89 S.Ct. 1404, 22 L.Ed.2d 739 (1969); Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U.S. 752, 93 S.Ct. 1245, 36 L.Ed.2d 1 (1973).\n\n\n27\nIn nearly all the voting cases relied upon by the Court and by the appellee, the Court was faced with situations where the disqualification amounted to a direct disenfranchisement or a vote dilution suffered by a discrete class whose impediment, as so imposed, was the result of an involuntary condition not directly tied to the franchise. See, for example, Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 86 S.Ct. 1079, 16 L.Ed.2d 169 (1966) (poll tax and wealth); Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964) (location); Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U.S. 701, 89 S.Ct. 1897, 23 L.Ed.2d 647 (1969) (property ownership); Carrington v. Rash, 380 U.S. 89, 85 S.Ct. 775, 13 L.Ed.2d 675 (1965) (military status). Cf. Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 92 S.Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972) (residence). In each of these cases there was a direct impairment of the ability of the affected class, without voluntary action, to participate in the electoral process. The level of intrusion was markedly significant.\n\n\n28\nWhat is before us here is a fairly complex statutory structure designed by Illinois to protect the integrity of the ballot box and the party system. The interest asserted by the State is clearly a legitimate one. Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U.S., at 761, 93 S.Ct., at 1251; Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S., at 345, 92 S.Ct., at 1004; Bullock v. Carter, 405 U.S. 134, 145, 92 S.Ct. 849, 857, 31 L.Ed.2d 92 (1972). And, it seems to me, means of the kind Illinois has employed are reasonably related to the fulfillment of that interest. The extent to which organized party raiding can disrupt, with unfortunate results, the orderly process of party primary balloting is, perhaps, open to reasonable differences of opinion. Indeed, in this case the parties have joined issue as to the precise degree of impact this practice has had in recent Illinois elections. Regardless of which factual version is to be credited, the legitimacy of the interest is unquestioned. With respect to a State like Illinois, where party regimentation on an extensive scale is legendary, the Court, in my view, should move cautiously when it is tempted to pass judgment in terms of assuming that there is a better or a less drastic means by which the State is able to achieve its admittedly laudable and lawful purpose.\n\n\n29\nBy resorting to a standard of rigid and strict review, and by indulging in what I fear is a departure from the appropriately deferential approach in Rosario, the Court places itself in the position of failing to give the States the elbow room they deserve and must possess if they are to formulate solutions for the many and particular problems confronting them that are associated with the preservation of the integrity of the franchise. Cf. Phoenix v. Kolodziejski, 399 U.S. 204, 90 S.Ct. 1990, 26 L.Ed.2d 523 (1970); Burns v. Fortson, 410 U.S. 686, 687, 93 S.Ct. 1209, 1210, 35 L.Ed.2d 633 (1973) (concurring opinion). Surely, at some point, the important interest of the State in protecting its entire electoral system outweighs a minor and incidental burden that happens to fall on a few uniquely situated citizens.\n\n\n30\nThe Illinois Legislature has determined that a rule precluding voting in the primaries of different parties in successive annual elections is a desirable and necessary means by which to preserve an otherwise vulnerable structure. In Rosario, 410 U.S., at 762, 93 S.Ct., at 1252, we applied a 'particularized legitimate purpose' standard to a similarly directed scheme and upheld the New York statute. As Mr. Justice REHNQUIST points out in his dissent, post, at 68, the degree of disenfranchisement resulting from the New York provision is potentially as great as, if not greater than, the Illinois provision challenged here. That case and this one, taken together, therefore, effect incongruous results. Not only is the actual disenfranchisement in this case no greater than that in Rosario, but the Illinois provision has a more rational relation to its purpose than does the New York provision. The New York statute specified an arbitrary time period prior to which it is assumed that organized party switching for raiding purposes will not occur. In contrast, Illinois chose not to employ a flat time limit that is by nature speculative and arbitrary; instead, it tied its disqualification directly to a significant event, namely, a vote in another party's last primary. Seemingly, the 23-month period was chosen so that the limitation would not extend back beyond the most recent primary. When primaries are held annually, the 23-month period amounts to no more than a one-year limitation, and in this respect the statute is drawn as narrowly as can be expected for a system that is tied to a prior primary vote rather than a designated time period. By tying the cut-off to a primary, the Illinois scheme seems directly designed to succeed in preventing organized crossovers, for it is highly unlikely that any significant number of party regulars would ever be instructed not to vote at all in one primary in order to subvert the next one that will not be held for another year.\n\n\n31\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST also observes that the Illinois system does have the side effect of creating a per se exclusion for a few voters. It is this factor, apparently, that has caused the Court to seek to distinguish Rosario. In New York the disqualification occasioned by the time limit will have its impact, more often than not, upon those who have not been diligent. This, indeed, was the very situation in Rosario. The Illinois provision, on the other hand, affects only party switchers. And they clearly are the group most amenable to organized raiding. I do not agree that any marginal difference that may exist between the New York rule and the Illinois rule must have the effect of transforming a 'legitimate time limitation,' Rosario, 410 U.S., at 762, 93 S.Ct., at 1252, into an unconstitutional denial of freedom of association. This incongruity underscores what I believe to be the potential mischief that results from an easy and all-too-ready resort to a strict-scrutiny standard in election cases of this kind. To be sure, the line between constitutionality and unconstitutionality must be drawn somewhere. But I would not draw it short of what Illinois has done here.\n\n\n32\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Mr. Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting.\n\n\n33\nThe Court decides that the Illinois rule disqualifying a person from voting in the primary of one political party if he has voted in the primary of another political party during the preceding 23 months imposes an impermissible burden on Illinois voters' exercise of their right of free political association. In so doing it distinguishes Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U.S. 752, 93 S.Ct. 1245, 36 L.Ed.2d 1 (1973), decided last Term. I find Rosario more difficult to distinguish than does the Court.\n\n\n34\nSection 7\u201443 of the Illinois Election Code provides that every person eligible to register to vote is entitled to vote at primary elections; it goes on to set out a number of exceptions to that general entitlement, including both persons disqualified under the 23-month rule challenged in this case and persons disqualified because they refuse to declare a party affiliation.1 Section 7\u201444 requires a primary voter to declare his party affiliation to the primary judges at the polling place; it further provides that, if challenged, the voter must establish his right to vote.2 Section 7 45 requires a challenged voter to supply an affidavit, in a statutorily prescribed form, to establish that he is entitled to vote under \u00a7 7\u201443. The affidavit states, inter alia, that the affiant has not voted in the primary of any other political party within the forbidden 23-month period.\n\n\n35\nThe Illinois system of primary elections, unlike the New York system before the Court in Rosario, does not require a voter to have enrolled as a member of a party months in advance in order to be eligible to vote in that party's primary. Illinois provides instead for a declaration of party affiliation at the primary polling place. And Illinois, not surprisingly in view of its different primary system, has chosen another way to protect its interest in preventing 'raiding' than has New York. It is true, as the Court makes clear, that the Illinois rule requires a voter affiliated with one party to sit out primaries during a period of 23 months in order to effectuate a switch in affiliation to another party and qualify to vote in its primaries. In this respect Illinois' rule imposes a greater burden on its voters' associational freedom than does New York's, since in New York a sufficiently prescient and diligent voter can vote in a different party's primary every year. Of course, it cannot be said whether the Illinois appellee here underwent her change in party loyalty in time, and would have taken the necessary steps to enroll, had Illinois had New York's rule.\n\n\n36\nOn the other hand, Illinois' rule imposes a lesser burden on its previously unaffiliated voters than does New York's. Indeed, it imposes a lesser burden on any voter who has, for whatever reason, failed to vote in the primary of another party within the past 23 months. Such voters are not required to foresee their interest in the primary by eight or more months, as are New York voters under the rule upheld in Rosario. As a practical matter, a voter is not required to swear that he has not participated in the primary of another party as a condition of his right to vote unless he is challenged. In these respects the Illinois rule is more closely tailored to the State's interest in preventing 'raiding' than is the New York rule. Voters who have recently demonstrated loyalty to another party by voting in its primary, are more likely than those who have not to engage in 'raiding.' Moreover, challenges for violations of the 23-month rule are not likely to be made where no serious danger of 'raiding' is perceived.\n\n\n37\nBoth the Illinois rule struck down today and the New York rule upheld in Rosario restrict voters' freedom to associate with the political party of their choice. In both instances the State has sought to justify the restrictions as promoting the State's legitimate interest in preventing 'raiding.' While neither rule is perfectly fashioned to accomplish that and no other result, I cannot conclude that the Illinois rule imposes a significantly greater burden on the exercise of associational freedom than does the New York rule we upheld last Term in Rosario.\n\n\n\n1\n Ill.Rev.Stat., c. 46, \u00a7 7\u201443 provides, in pertinent part:\n'No person shall be entitled to vote at a primary:\n'(d) If he has voted at a primary held under this Article 7 of another political party within a period of 23 calendar months next preceding the calendar month in which such primary is held: Provided, participation by a primary elector in a primary of a political party which, under the provisions of Section 7\u20142 of this Article, is a political party within a city, village or incorporated town or town only and entitled hereunder to make nominations of candidates for city, village or incorporated town or town offices only, and for no other office or offices, shall not disqualify such primary elector from participating in other primaries of his party: And, provided, that no qualified voter shall be precluded from participating in the primary of any purely city, village or incorporated town or town political party under the provisions of Section 7\u20142 of this Article by reason of such voter having voted at the primary of another political party within a period of 23 calendar months next preceding the calendar month in which he seeks to participate in held.'\n\n\n2\n The Republican primary in which the appellee voted involved nominations for the offices of mayor, city clerk, and city treasurer of Chicago.\n\n\n3\n The March 1972 Democratic primary involved, inter alia, nominations for Governor, United States Senator, United States Representative, state legislators, county officers, and delegates to the National Convention of the Democratic Party.\n\n\n4\n 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2281, 2284.\n\n\n5\n The District Court upheld the constitutional validity of Ill.Rev.Stat., c. 46, \u00a7\u00a7 7\u201443(a) and 7\u201444, which require a declaration of party affiliation as a prerequisite to voting in a primary election. This holding, which was unanimous, has not been appealed.\n\n\n6\n This case was consolidated in the District Court with a similar action brought by two other voters against the county clerk of Lake County, Illinois. The defendant in that case has not appealed from the District Court's judgment.\n\n\n7\n The appellants in this case are members of the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners, who are responsible for administering the provisions of the Illinois Election Code within the city. See Ill.Rev.Stat., c. 46, \u00a7 6\u201421 et seq.\n\n\n8\n Bracketed material in original.\n\n\n9\n Ill.Rev.Stat., c. 46, \u00a7 7\u20142 defines the term 'political party' under Illinois law, and states the offices for which various types of political parties are entitled to make nominations. Under \u00a7 7\u20142, a party that garners more than 5% of the entire vote cast at a statewide general election is defined as a 'political party within the State,' and is entitled to make nominations for all state and county offices in the next succeeding primary. Similarly, a party that polls more than 5% of the entire vote cast at a municipal general election is defined as a 'political party within . . . (a) city,' and is entitled to make nominations for city elective positions at the next succeeding primary.\nUnder \u00a7 7\u201443(d), a 'political party within a city . . . only' is one that has qualified under \u00a7 7\u20142 to make only city nominations; in other words, a party that has polled more than 5% of the vote at the preceding municipal general election, but less than 5% of the vote at the preceding state-wide general election. Obviously, the Republican party, in whose 1971 Chicago primary the appellee voted, does not fit within this description.\n\n\n10\n It is true, as the appellants argue, that the plaintiff in Faherty v. Board of Election Comm'rs, 5 Ill.2d 519, 126 N.E.2d 235, wished to vote in a Chicago Democratic primary after having voted, within the past year, in a statewide Republican primary; thus, the factual setting in Faherty was precisely the converse of that here. This, however, is a distinction without a difference. The holding of Faherty was that Republican and Democratic primaries, even those involving only citywide offices, were not primaries of political parties 'within a city . . . only.' See n. 9, supra. Thus, these primaries are fully within the purview of the \u00a7 7\u201443(d) 23-month rule.\n\n\n11\n See Art. I, \u00a7 2; Art. II, \u00a7 1. With respect to elections to federal office, however, the Court has held that Congress has power to establish voter qualifications. Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 91 S.Ct. 260, 27 L.Ed.2d 272.\n\n\n12\n NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 462, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 1171, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488.\n\n\n13\n Bates v. Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516, 523, 80 S.Ct. 412, 416, 4 L.Ed.2d 480.\n\n\n14\n N.Y. Election Law \u00a7 186, McKinney's Consol.Laws, c. 100.\n\n\n15\n New York presidential primaries are held in June; thus, in presidential election years, the cutoff date prescribed by \u00a7 186 occurs about eight months before the primary. Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U.S. 752, 760, 93 S.Ct. 1245, 1251, 36 L.Ed.2d 1.\n\n\n16\n She could, of course, have made herself eligible to vote in the 1972 Democratic primary by forgoing participation in the 1971 Republican primary. But such a course would have prevented her from associating with the party of her choice in 1971, and thus in no way would have obviated the constitutional deficiencies inherent in the Illinois law.\n\n\n1\n Ill.Rev.Stat., c. 46, \u00a7 7\u201443, provides:\n'Every person having resided in this State 6 months and in the precinct 30 days next preceding any primary therein who shall be a citizen of the United States above the age of 21 years, shall be entitled to vote at such primary.\n'The following regulations shall be applicable to primaries:\n'No person shall be entitled to vote at a primary:\n'(a) Unless he declares his party affiliations as required by this Article;\n'(b) Who shall have signed the petition for nomination of a candidate of any party with which he does not affiliate, when such candidate is to be voted for at the primary;\n'(c) Who shall have signed the nominating papers of an independent candidate for any office for which office candidates for nomination are to be voted for at such primary; or\n'(d) If he has voted at a primary held under this Article 7 of another political party within a period of 23 calendar months next preceding the calendar month is which such primary is held: Provided, participation by a primary elector in a primary of a political party which, under the provisions of Section 7\u20142 of this Article, is a political party within a city, village or incorporated town or town only and entitled hereunder to make nominations of candidates for city, village or incorporated town or town offices only, and for no other office or offices, shall not disqualify such primary elector from participating in other primaries of his party: And, provided, that no qualified voter shall be precluded from participating in the primary of any purely city, village or incorporated town or town political party under the provisions of Section 7\u20142 of this Article by reason of such voter having voted at the primary of another political party within a period of 23 calendar months next preceding the calendar month (in which such primary) in which he seeks to participate is held.\n'(e) In cities, villages and incorporated towns having a board of election commissioners only voters registered as provided by Article 6 of this Act shall be entitled to vote at such primary.\n'(f) No person shall be entitled to vote at a primary unless he is registered under the provisions of Article 4, 5 or 6 of this Act, when his registration is required by any of said Articles to entitle him to vote at the election with reference to which the primary is held.'\n\n\n2\n Ill.Rev.Stat., c. 46, \u00a7 7\u201444 provides: 'Any person desiring to vote at a primary shall state his name, residence and party affiliation to the primary judges, one of whom shall thereupon announce the same in a distinct tone of voice, sufficiently loud to be heard by all persons in the polling place. When article 4, 5 or 6 is applicable the Certificate of Registered Voter therein prescribed shall be made and signed and the official poll record shall be made. If the person desiring to vote is not challenged, one of the primary judges shall give to him one, and only one, primary ballot of the political party with which he declares himself affiliated, on the back of which such primary judge shall endorse his initials in such manner that they may be seen when the primary ballot is properly folded. If the person desiring to vote is challenged he shall not receive a primary ballot from the primary judges until he shall have established his right to vote as hereinafter provided. No person who refuses to state his party affiliation shall be allowed to vote at a primary.'\n\n\n","label":1}

United States, 385 U.S. 927, 87 S.Ct. 284, 17 L.Ed.2d 210, we today denied the petition for certiorari. The sole question raised there (but not passed upon by the Court of Appeals because not necessary to its disposition) involved petitioners' claim that conferences between petitioners and their counsel were surreptitiously overheard and intercepted by law enforcement officials through concealed monitorial devices built into the jail where petitioners were being held for federal authorities. The Solicitor General did not deny the existence of the devices but said that there were no recordings of the conversations in question. He pointed out that since the case has been remanded by the Court of Appeals for a new trial on other grounds, a full exploration of this question could be made on retrial. In the light of these representations we denied the petition for certiorari so that the question might be fully explored at the new trial, as suggested by the Solicitor General.\n\n\n2\nIn the instant case, Black v. United States, the petition for rehearing now raises a similar question and while Davis v. United States, supra, is not controlling, its relation is obvious. In Black the Solicitor General advised the Court voluntarily on May 24, 1966, after the petition for certiorari had been denied, 384 U.S. 927, 86 S.Ct. 1444, 16 L.Ed.2d 530, but before an application for rehearing had been filed, that agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in a matter unrelated to this case, on February 7, 1963, installed a listening device in petitioner's hotel suite in Washington, D.C. The device monitored and taped conversations held in the hotel suite during the period the offense was being investigated and beginning some two months before and continuing until about one month after the evidence in this case was presented to the Grand Jury. During that period, 'the monitoring agents,' the Solicitor General advised 'overheard, among other conversations, exchanges between petitioner and the attorney who was then representing him (Black)' in this case. In a supplemental memorandum filed July 13, 1966, the Solicitor General, in response to an inquiry by the Court, stated that the recordings of such interceptions had been erased from the tapes but that notes summarizing and sometimes quoting the conversations intercepted were available, and that reports and memoranda concerning the same had been made. 'Neither the reports nor the memoranda,' he reported, 'were seen by attorneys of the Tax Division responsible for the prosecution of' this case until January 1964, when in preparing for trial they were included in material transmitted to them; the reports and memoranda of the intercepted conversations were examined by the Tax Division attorneys and retained by them until April 15, 1964, when petitioner's trial began; and the attorneys never realized until April 21, 1966, that any conversations between Black and his attorney had been overheard and included in the transcriptions.\n\n\n3\nThe Solicitor General advised further that the 'Tax Division attorneys found nothing in the F.B.I. reports or memoranda which they considered relevant to the tax evasion case.' He suggests that the judgment be vacated and remanded to the District Court in which the 'relevant materials would be produced and the court would determine, upon an adversary hearing, whether petitioner's conviction should stand.' We have sometimes used this technique in federal criminal cases, United States v. Shotwell Mfg. Co., 355 U.S. 233, 78 S.Ct. 245, 2 L.Ed.2d 234. However, its use has never been automatic. Indeed, in Remmer v. United States, 347 U.S. 227, 74 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed. 654, we found it necessary, despite the hearing in the District Court, to subsequently order a new trial on the merits, 350 U.S. 377, 76 S.Ct. 425, 100 L.Ed. 435. There are other complicating factors here that were not present in Remmer. There the judge had been informed of the alleged jury tampering, but here neither the judge, the petitioner nor his counsel knew of the action of the federal agents. Moreover, the Solicitor General advises that the Tax Division attorneys did not know at the time of the trial that conversations between Black and his attorney were included in the transcriptions. In view of these facts it appears that justice requires that a new trial be held so as to afford the petitioner an opportunity to protect himself from the use of evidence that might be otherwise inadmissible.\n\n\n4\nThis Court has never been disposed to vacate convictions without adequate justification, but, under the circumstances presented by the Solicitor General in this case we believe that a new trial must be held. This will give the parties an opportunity to present the relevant evidence and permit the trial judge to decide the questions involved. It will also permit the removal of any doubt as to Black's receiving a fair trial with full consideration being given to the new evidence reported to us by the Solicitor General.\n\n\n5\nThe petition for rehearing is therefore granted, the order denying certiorari vacated, certiorari granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals vacated and the cause remanded to the District Court for a new trial.\n\n\n6\nMr. Justice WHITE and Mr. Justice FORTAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n7\nMr. Justice HARLAN, whom Mr. Justice STEWART joins, dissenting.\n\n\n8\nThe denial of certiorari in No. 245, Davis v. United States where the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, 357 F.2d 438, has already ordered a new trial on grounds wholly unrelated to alleged eavesdropping and at which trial petitioners will have a full opportunity to explore their contentions that the Government interfered with their constitutionally protected right to counsel bears no solid relation to, still less furnishes justification for, what the Court has done in the present case. A brief statement of the circumstances of the Black disposition will reveal that in summarily vacating this final conviction and ordering a completely new trial the Court has acted prematurely.\n\n\n9\nIn 1964, petitioner Black was convicted in the District Court of federal income tax violations. His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on November 10, 1965. 122 U.S.App.D.C. 347, 353 F.2d 885. Certiorari was denied by this Court on May 2, 1966. 384 U.S. 927, 86 S.Ct. 1444, 16 L.Ed.2d 530. Before Black's petition for rehearing was filed here, the Solicitor General filed a memorandum bringing to the Court's attention the fact that in the course of an unrelated criminal investigation Black's hotel suite had been 'bugged' by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and conversations between Black and his attorney electronically recorded. The Solicitor General further stated that in consequence of an investigation, instituted by him following his discovery of this occurrence, he was able to represent to the Court that none of the information so procured had been utilized in Black's aforesaid prosecution. In a further memorandum, filed in compliance with a request from this Court, the Solicitor General has represented that it was not until late August 1965 that the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice learned that a listening device had been installed in Black's hotel suite and not until April 21, 1966, that attorneys in the Tax Division, responsible for the prosecution, learned that any conversations between Black and his counsel had been overheard.\n\n\n10\nThe Solicitor General recognizes that Black is entitled to a full exploration of the matter, and to that end suggests that the case be remanded to the District Court for a hearing and findings on the episode in question as it may bear on the validity of Black's conviction. Black responds that this course is inadequate and contends that this Court should, without more, forthwith order dismissal of the indictment in this income tax prosecution.\n\n\n11\nWithout anything more before it than the representations made by both sides, the Court today orders a totally new trial in spite of the fact that the disclosure commendably made by the Solicitor General reveal no use of 'bugged' material in Black's prosecution, and no knowledge by prosecuting attorneys that material may have been improperly obtained. I agree, of course, that petitioner is entitled to a full-scale development of the facts, but I can see no valid reason why this unimpeached conviction should be vacated at this stage. In Davis, supra, exploration of the alleged eavesdropping episode is appropriate upon the retrial of the case since the original conviction has already fallen on other grounds. In the Black case, however, a new trial is not an appropriate vehicle for sorting out the eavesdropping issue because until it is determined that such occurrence vitiated the original conviction no basis for a retrial exists. The Court's action puts the cart before the horse. The orderly procedure is to remand the case to the District Court for a hearing and findings on the issues in question. See United States v. Shotwell Mfg. Co., 355 U.S. 233, 78 S.Ct. 245, 2 L.Ed.2d 234. See also Remmer v. United States, 347 U.S. 227, 74 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed. 654; 350 U.S. 377, 76 S.Ct. 425, 100 L.Ed. 435. Unless and until the facts on this issue have been resolved and their legal effect assessed favorably to petitioner, this conviction should remain undisturbed.\n\n\n12\nThe only basis I can think of for justifying this decision is that any governmental activity of the kind here in question automatically vitiates, so as at least to require a new trial, any conviction occurring during the span of such activity. But I cannot believe that the Court, without even briefing or argument, intends to make any such sweeping innovation in the federal criminal law by today's peremptory disposition of this case.\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"452 U.S. 549\n101 S.Ct. 2510\n69 L.Ed.2d 226\nRoger D. MONROE, Petitioner,v.The STANDARD OIL COMPANY.\nNo. 80-298.\nArgued March 4, 1981.\nDecided June 17, 1981.\n\n\nSyllabus\n\nThe Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 provides in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2021(b)(3) that any employee of a private employer \"shall not be denied retention in employment or any promotion or other incident or advantage of employment because of any obligation as a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces.\"  Petitioner was an employee in respondent's refinery, which operated 24 hours a day, every day of the year, and whose employees worked five 8-hour days weekly but in a different 5-day sequence each week.  As a military reservist, petitioner had to attend training with his unit one weekend a month and for two weeks each summer.  On a number of weekends, petitioner was required to attend training on days when he was scheduled to work at the refinery, and in most instances he was unable to exchange shifts with other employees as he was permitted to do.  Respondent provided him with leaves of absence to attend training, as required by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2024(d), but it did not pay him for the hours he did not work nor did it take steps to permit him to make up those hours by working outside the normal schedule.  Petitioner brought an action against respondent in Federal District Court, alleging, inter alia, that respondent had violated \u00a7 2021(b)(3). The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioner on the ground that respondent, by not scheduling petitioner for a full 40-hour week on those occasions when he was unable to exchange shifts, had denied him \"an incident or advantage of employment\" within the meaning of \u00a7 2021(b)(3), and awarded him an amount for wages lost on those \"work dates when an accommodation should have been made.\"  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent had taken no discriminatory action proscribed by \u00a7 2021(b)(3).\nHeld :  Section 2021(b)(3) does not require an employer to make work-scheduling accommodations for employee-reservists not made for other employees.  Pp. 554-566.\n(a) The legislative history indicates that \u00a7 2021(b)(3) was enacted for the significant but limited purpose of protecting the employee-reservist from discrimination like discharge and demotion motivated solely by reserve status.  There is nothing in \u00a7 2021(b)(3) or its legislative history to indicate that Congress even considered imposing an obligation on employers to provide a special work-scheduling preference, but rather the history suggests that Congress did not intend employers to provide special benefits to employee-reservists not generally made available to other employees.  Pp. 554-562.\n(b) While this case involves absences for weekend duty, \u00a7 2021(b)(3) refers to \"any obligation as a member of a Reserve component.\"  Accordingly, there is no principled way of distinguishing between an employer's obligation to make scheduling accommodations for weekends as opposed to, for example, annual 2-week training periods, or even longer periods of training or duty.  There is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that Congress intended reservists to be entitled to all \"incidents and advantages of employment\" accorded during their absence to working employees, including regular time and overtime pay.  P.p. 562-563.\n(c) There is nothing in the statute or its history to support petitioner's contention that \u00a7 2021(b)(3) only requires an employer under the circumstances of this case to make a \"reasonable accommodation\" to employee-reservists.  Such a \"reasonable accommodation\" has already been made in \u00a7 2024(d) by requiring employers to grant a leave of absence to reservists whose duties force them to miss time at work.  To say that \u00a7 2021(b)(3) would be of little significance unless a \"reasonable accommodation\" requirement is imposed, ignores the fact that the nondiscrimination requirements of the section already impose substantial obligations on employers by precluding them from ridding themselves of the inconveniences and productivity losses resulting from employee-reservists' absence by discharging or otherwise disadvantaging such employees solely because of their military obligations.  Pp. 563-565.\n6th Cir. 613 F.2d 641, affirmed.\nAlan I. Horowitz, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nPaul S. McAuliffe, Cleveland, Ohio, for respondent.\nJustice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2021(b)(3), a provision of the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, does not require an employer to provide preferential scheduling of work hours for an employee who must be absent from work to fulfill his military reserve obligations.  613 F.2d 641.  We granted certiorari to consider the petitioner's contention that an employer has a statutory duty to make work-scheduling accommodations for reservist-employees not made for other employees, whenever such accommodations reasonably can be accomplished.  449 U.S. 949, 101 S.Ct. 352, 66 L.Ed.2d 213.1\n\n\n2\n* In 1975 and 1976, the years pertinent to this litigation, the petitioner was a full-time employee in the respondent's continuous process refinery in Lima, Ohio.  The refinery was operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  To insure that the burdens of weekend and shift work would be equitably divided among its employees over the course of a year, the respondent scheduled its employees to work five 8-hour days in a row weekly, but in a different 5-day sequence each week.  Under the respondent's collective agreement with its union, however, an employee could, with the acquiescence of his foreman and if the change did not require the payment of overtime, exchange shifts with another employee.\n\n\n3\nDuring the same period, the petitioner was a military reservist,2 and had to attend training with his unit one weekend a month and for two weeks each summer.  On a number of weekends, the petitioner was required to attend training on days when he was scheduled to work at the refinery.  Although the petitioner was able on four of these occasions to exchange shifts with other employees, he was unable to make such an exchange in most instances.  The respondent provided him with leaves of absence to attend training, as 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2024(d)3 required it to do, but it did not pay him for the hours he did not work, nor did it take steps to permit him to make up those hours by working outside his normal schedule.  When the petitioner was on a leave of absence and could not arrange a switch with another employee, the respondent would make arrangements to fill the vacancy created by the petitioner's absence, arrangements often requiring the payment of overtime wages to the substitute.\n\n\n4\nIn 1976, the petitioner4 brought this action against the respondent alleging that it had violated the provisions of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2021(b)(3)5 and 2024(d).  Noting that the first of these sections provides that an employer may not deny a military reservist in his employ any \"incident or advantage of employment\" because of the employee's obligations to the Reserves, and finding that \"being scheduled for a full forty hour week at the [respondent's] refinery constitutes an incident or advantage of employment,\" the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio granted summary judgment to the petitioner.  446 F.Supp. 616, 618, 619.  The court awarded petitioner $1,086.72 for wages lost on those \"work dates when an accommodation should have been made.\" Id., at 619.6\n\n\n5\nThe Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed.  613 F.2d 641.  First, it determined that the respondent had met the requirements of \u00a7 2024(d).7  It noted that this section \"guarantees terms and conditions of reemployment to reservists returning from inactive duty training,\" but found that \"[i]t does not, however, protect reservists from discrimination by their employers between training assignments.\"  Id., at 643-644.\n\n\n6\nNext, the Court of Appeals rejected the District Court's interpretation of \u00a7 2021(b)(3).  It held that this section \"merely requires that reservists be treated equally or neutrally with their fellow employees without military obligations.\"  Id., at 646.  The appellate court then concluded that the respondent had taken no discriminatory action that is proscribed by \u00a7 2021(b)(3):\n\n\n7\n\"The requirement of equal treatment was met in the      present case.  The parties agreed that appellee was regularly      scheduled for forty-hour workweeks, as were his fellow      employees.  Further, Monroe was scheduled for weekend work in      accordance with Sohio's established practice of rotating      shifts to insure that all employees would work approximately      an equal number of weekend days.  Finally, he was treated the      same as his coworkers with regard to the right to exchange      shifts with other employees.\"  Id., at 646.\n\nII\n\n8\nThis case presents the first occasion this Court has had to address issues arising from the statutory provisions, codified at 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2021 et seq., specifically dealing with military reservists.8  We have, however, frequently interpreted the somewhat analogous statutory provisions entitling the returning regular veteran to reinstatement with his \"seniority, status and pay\" intact, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2021(a), most recently in Coffy v. Republic Steel Corp., 447 U.S. 191, 100 S.Ct. 2100, 65 L.Ed.2d 53, and Alabama Power Co. v. Davis, 431 U.S. 581, 97 S.Ct. 2002, 52 L.Ed.2d 595.\n\n\n9\nStatutory re-employment rights for veterans date from the Nation's first peacetime draft law, passed in 1940, which provided that a veteran returning to civilian employment from active duty was entitled to reinstatement to the position that he had left or one of \"like seniority, status, and pay.\"  38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2021(a).  In 1951, in order to strengthen the Nation's Reserve Forces, Congress extended reinstatement rights to employees returning from training duty.  See Pub. L. 51, ch. 144, \u00a7 1(s), 65 Stat. 75, 86-87.  Thereafter, the Reserve Forces Act of 1955, Pub.L. 305, ch. 665, \u00a7 262(f), 69 Stat. 598, 602, provided that employees returning from active duty of more than three months in the Ready Reserve were entitled to the same employment rights as inductees, with limited exceptions.  In 1960, these re-employment rights were extended to National Guardsmen, Pub.L. 86-632, 74 Stat. 467.  See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2024(c).  In addition, a new section, now codified at 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2024(d), was enacted in 1960 to deal with problems faced by employees who had military training obligations lasting less than three months.  This section provides that employees must be granted a leave of absence for training and, upon their return, be restored to their position \"with such seniority, status, pay, and vacation\" as they would have had if they had not been absent for training.\n\n\n10\nSection 2024(d) closely paralleled 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2021(a), the latter section ensuring the reinstatement of regular veterans returning from active duty.9  But \u00a7 2024(d) did not provide reservists with protection against discharges, demotions, or other discriminatory conduct once reinstated.  Section 2021(b)(2), on the other hand, provided regular veterans returning from active duty one year's \"protection . . . against certain types of discharges or demotions that might rob the veteran's reemployment of its substance.\"  Oakley v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 338 U.S. 278, 285, 70 S.Ct. 119, 123, 94 L.Ed. 87.  The legislative history of \u00a7 2021(b)(3) indicates that it was designed to provide similar protection to employee-reservists.10\n\nB\n\n11\nSection 2021(b)(3) provides in pertinent part:\n\n\n12\n\"Any person who [is employed by a private employer]      shall not be denied retention in employment or any promotion      or other incident or advantage of employment because of any      obligation as a member of a Reserve component of the Armed      Forces.\"\n\n\n13\nThe Senate Report on the bill that became \u00a72021(b)(3), stated that the purpose of the enactment was 'to prevent reservists and National Guardsmen not on active duty who must attend weekend drills or summer training from being discriminated against in employment because of their Reserve membership....' S. Rep. No. 1 477, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 1-2 (1968). The Report explained that '[e]mployment practices that discriminate against employees with Reserve obligations have become an increasing problem in recent years. Some of these employees have been denied promotions because they must attend weekly drills or summer training and others have been discharged because of these obligations.... [T]he bill is intended to protect members of the Reserve components of the Armed Forces from such practices.' Id., at 2. The protection was to be accomplished by entitling reservists 'to the same treatment afforded their co-workers not having such military obligations....' Ibid.\n\n\n14\nThe House Report announced the same motivation.  The bill was described as providing \"job protection for employees with obligations as members of a reserve component.\"  H. R. Rep. No. 1303, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1968).  The House Report elaborated as follows:\n\n\n15\n\"Section (1) amplifies existing law to make clear that      reservists not on active duty, who have a remaining Reserve      obligation, whether acquired voluntarily or involuntarily,      will nonetheless not be discriminated against by their      employees [sic] soley [sic] because of such Reserve      affiliation.\n\n\n16\n\"It assures that these reservists will be entitled to      the same treatment afforded their coworkers without such      military obligation.\n\n\n17\n\"The law does not now protect these reservists against      discharge without cause, as it does with inductees and      enlistees, who have 1-year protection, and initial active      duty for training reservists, who have 6 months' protection.\"      Ibid. (emphasis added).\n\n\n18\nThe legislation was originally proposed by the Department of Labor.  Accordingly, the testimony of Hugh W. Bradley, Director of the Office of Veterans' Reemployment Rights of the Labor Department, who was the chief administration spokesman for the provision, is instructive.  He described the relevant portions of the legislation to the House Committee on Armed Services:\n\n\n19\n\"The first provision of the bill deals with a problem that      has been increasingly difficult in the past few years.  It is      designed to enable reservists and guardsmen who leave- their jobs to perform training in the Armed Forces, to retain      their employment and to enjoy all of the employment      opportunities and benefits accorded their coworkers who do      not have military training obligations.  The law does not now      protect them against discharge without cause as it does      inductees and enlistees, who have 1-year protection, and      initial active duty for training reservists, who have 6      months' protection.\"  1966 House Hearings, at 5312 (emphasis      added).\n\n\n20\nSee also 1968 House Hearings, at 7471.\n\n\n21\nTestimony by Rear Admiral Burton H. Shupper, U.S.N., appearing on behalf of the Department of Defense, also reflected the purposes behind the enactment:\n\n\n22\n\"The other aspect of H. R. 11509 is the provision that      employees shall not be denied retention in employment or      advantages of employment because of any obligation as a      member of a Reserve component of the Armed Forces.  After the      Berlin and Cuba callups, we received information from our      Reserve community that a significant number of reservists      were receiving indications that opportunities for advancement      and retention in civilian employment would favor those who      appear to offer their employers more continuity of services,      namely those in the Standby Reserve or those with no Reserve      status.  In fairness, we must emphasize that this reaction on      the part of employers appears to be the exception not the      rule and, we believe, is generally not based upon unpatriotic      motives but rather on the competitive spirit of business.\"      1966 House Hearings, at 5315.\n\n\n23\nThe legislative history thus indicates that \u00a7 2021(b)(3) was enacted for the significant but limited purpose of protecting the employee-reservist against discriminations like discharge and demotion, motivated solely by reserve status.  Congress wished to provide protection to reservists comparable to that already protecting the regular veteran from \"discharge without cause\"\u2014to insure that employers would not penalize or rid themselves of returning reservists after a mere pro forma compliance with \u00a7 2024(d).11  and the consistent focus of the administration that proposed the statute, and of the Congresses that considered it, was on the need to protect reservists from the temptation of employers to deny them the same treatment afforded their co-workers without military obligations.  The petitioner's contention that his employer was obliged to provide work-schedule preferences not available to other employees must be considered against this legislative background.\n\nC\n\n24\nThe petitioner's argument is that the respondent corporation was obligated to make special efforts to schedule his work hours so he would avoid any lost time by reason of his reserve obligations.  He does not allege that the respondent singled him out unfairly, or in any other way discriminated against him vis-a-vis other employees in the scheduling of work. Indeed, the petitioner's argument would require work-assignment preferences not available to any nonreservist employee at the respondent's refinery.\n\n\n25\nThe problem with the petitioner's position is that there is nothing in \u00a7 2021(b)(3) or its legislative history to indicate that Congress ever even considered imposing an obligation on employers to provide a special work-scheduling preference. Indeed, the legislative history, set out above, strongly suggests that Congress did not intend employers to provide special benefits to employee-reservists not generally made available to other employees.12  Congress, and the administration spokesman for the legislation, stated explicitly that reservists were to be entitled \"to the same treatment afforded their co-workers not having such military obligations. . . .\"  S. Rep. No. 1477, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1968);  see also H. R. Rep. No. 1303, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1966);  1968 House Hearings, at 7471 (testimony of Hugh W. Bradley).\n\n\n26\nThe strongest language culled by the petitioner from the legislative history to support his argument is a single passage in the 1966 House Report on H. R. 11509:  \"If these young men are essential to our national defense, then certainly our Government and employers have a moral obligation to see that their economic well being is disrupted to the minimum extent possible.\"  H. R. Rep. No. 1303, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1966).13  But this generalized statement appears only in the 1966 House Report;  it is not contained in either the House or the Senate Report that accompanied the bill as finally enacted in the 90th Congress.  Compare ibid. with H. R. Rep. No. 1303, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 3, 8 (1968), and S. Rep. No. 1477, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1968).  Moreover, language in the same 1966 House Report specifically indicated that only a nondiscrimination measure was intended:  \"It should be noted that the only substantive changes in existing law relate to . . . the prohibition against employer discrimination against reservists who participate in the Reserve or National Guard programs.\"  H. R. Rep. No. 1303, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 4 (1966).\n\n\n27\nIt appears that the origin of the passage the petitioner relies on is a statement by Hugh W. Bradley before the House Committee in 1966.  See 1966 House Hearings, at 5313.  Yet this passage disappeared from Bradley's presentation to both the House and Senate Committees in the subsequent Congress.  See 1968 House Hearings, at 7471, 7472;  1968 Senate Hearings, at 2, 3.  And in all three of his congressional appearances, Bradley made it abundantly clear that the purpose of the legislation was to protect employee reservists from discharge, denial of promotional opportunities, or other comparable adverse treatment solely by reason of their military obligations;  there was never any suggestion of employer responsibility to provide preferential treatment.  In any case, the language relied on by the petitioner hardly supports a finding that Congress intended \u00a7 2021(b)(3) to convert a generalized moral obligation into a specific legal duty.\n\nD\n\n28\nAside from a lack of support in legislative history, the petitioner's argument suffers other flaws.  While the present case involves absences for weekend duty, the statutory language is not so limited;  it refers to \"any obligation as a member of a Reserve component. . . .\"  Section 2021(b)(3) has been applied, for example, to 2-week summer camps, Carney v. Cummins Engine Co., 602 F.2d 763 (CA7);  6-week training sessions, Carlson v. New Hampshire Dept. of Safety, 609 F.2d 1024 (CA1);  and two-month training sessions, Peel v. Florida Dept. of Transportation, 443 F.Supp. 451 (ND Fla.), aff'd, 600 F.2d 1070 (CA5).  Accordingly, there is no principled way of distinguishing between an employer's obligation to make scheduling accommodations for weekends as opposed to, for example, annual 2-week training periods, or even longer periods of training or duty.  And certainly there is nothing in the legislative history that would indicate Congress intended that reservists were to be entitled to all \"incidents and advantages of employment\" accorded during their absence to working employees, including regular time and overtime pay.14\n\n\n29\nThe petitioner concedes that it might be impossible, or at least unduly burdensome, to accommodate a reservist's absences for periods as long as the mandatory 2-week summer training session. Perhaps for this reason, he attempts to limit the obvious implications of his theory by arguing that \"the statute only requires an employer to take reasonable steps to accommodate the reservists.\"  But, as is true of the petitioner's more general affirmative obligation theory, there is nothing in the statute or its history to support such a notion.\n\n\n30\nIndeed, a \"reasonable accommodation\" to employee-reservists because of missed worktime has already been made by Congress in \u00a7 2024(d).  There, Congress decided what allowance employers should make to reservists whose duties force them to miss time at work: provide them a leave of absence.  If Congress had wanted to impose an additional obligation upon employers, guaranteeing that employee-reservists have the opportunity to work the same number of hours, or earn the same amount of pay that they would have earned without absences attributable to military reserve duties, it could have done so expressly.15  By contrast, there is no evidence that the Congress that enacted \u00a7 2021(b)(3) showed any concern with the problem of missed work hours, let alone imposed any duty to \"take reasonable steps to accommodate the reservists\" in this or any other respect.\n\n\n31\nThe petitioner makes no suggestion why his theory of \"reasonable accommodation\" should apply only to \"incidents or advantages of employment,\" and not to the other provisions of \u00a7 2021(b)(3):  retention and promotion.  Presumably, if it applies to one provision of the section, it should apply to them all.  But if an employer could, for example, defend a denial of promotion to an employee-reservist because the promotion could not be \"reasonably accommodated,\" the protection afforded by \u00a7 2021(b)(3) would clearly be reduced, if not altogether eliminated.\n\n\n32\nFinally, the petitioner suggests that \u00a7 2021(b)(3) must have the meaning he attributes to it, because the section would otherwise be of little significance.  But the nondiscrimination requirements of the section impose substantial obligations upon employers.  The frequent absences from work of an employee-reservist may affect productivity and cause considerable inconvenience to an employer who must find alternative means to get necessary work done.  Yet Congress has provided in \u00a7 2021(b)(3) that employers may not rid themselves of such inconveniences and productivity losses by discharging or otherwise disadvantaging employee-reservists solely because of their military obligations.\n\nIII\n\n33\nThis Court does not sit to draw the most appropriate balance between benefits to employee-reservists and costs to employers. That is the responsibility of Congress.  If Congress desires to amend \u00a7 2021(b)(3) to require special work-hour scheduling for military reservists where it is reasonably possible, it is free to do so.  But we must deal with the law as it is.\n\n\n34\nThe respondent did not deny the petitioner anything that he would have received had he not been a reservist.  He was scheduled for 40 hours work a week, as all other employees in the refinery were.16  He was assigned the same burden of weekend and shift work as were his fellow employees.  And he was allowed to exchange shifts in the manner accepted by his union and the respondent, just as all other employees were.17  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n\n35\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n36\nChief Justice BURGER, with whom Justice BRENNAN, Justice BLACKMUN, and Justice POWELL join, dissenting.\n\n\n37\nThe Court today unduly restricts the employment protections accorded Ready Reservists and National Guardsmen by Congress.  In my view, the Court's decision is based upon an erroneous interpretation of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2021(b)(3) and, in effect, allows employees to be penalized for their service in the military contrary to congressional intent.\n\n\n38\n* A.\n\n\n39\nAs in any case involving statutory construction, \"our starting point must be the language employed by Congress.\"  Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 337, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 2330, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979).  Title 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2021(a) requires that a veteran returning to civilian employment after military duty be restored to the position he previously held or to \"a position of like seniority, status, and pay.\"  In addition, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2021(b)(1) provides that the veteran's reinstatement must be \"without loss of seniority\" and that he \"shall not be discharged from such position without cause within one year after such restoration or reemployment.\"  See Oakley v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 338 U.S. 278, 284-285, 70 S.Ct. 119, 122-23, 94 L.Ed. 87 (1949).  Similar safeguards are granted in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2024(c) to members of \"a Reserve component of the Armed Forces\" who have military obligations lasting more than three months.  As to reservists whose commitments are less than three months, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2024(d) provides in pertinent part:\n\n\n40\n\"Any employee . . . shall upon request be granted a      leave of absence by such person's employer for the period      required to perform active duty for training or inactive duty      training in the Armed Forces of the United States.  Upon such      employee's release from a period of such active duty for      training or inactive duty training, or upon such employee's      discharge from hospitalization incident to that training,      such employee shall be permitted to return to such employee's      position with such seniority, status, pay, and vacation as      such employee would have had if such employee had not been      absent for such purposes.\"\n\n\n41\nAdditional guarantees for reservists are contained in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2021(b)(3), on which petitioner bases his claim for nonconflicting work hours.  Section 2021(b)(3) states:\n\n\n42\n\"Any person who [is employed by the Federal Government,      a state government, or a private employer] shall not be      denied retention in employment or any promotion or other      incident or advantage of employment because of any obligation      as a member of a Reserve component of the Armed Forces.\"      (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n43\nThe Court concludes that \"\u00a7 2021(b)(3) was enacted for the . . . limited purpose of protecting the employee-reservist against discriminations like discharge and demotion motivated solely by reserve status.\"  Ante, at 559.  Yet the plain language of the statute belies such a narrow interpretation.  Although \u00a7 2021(b)(3) proscribes the termination of a reservist because of his military obligations, it also expressly prohibits the denial of \"any promotion or other incident or advantage of employment.\" Such protection is clearly broader than that enjoyed by returning veterans under \u00a7 2021(b)(1), but is understandable because the reservist has continuing military commitments requiring his absence that may disadvantage him in his employment.\n\nB\n\n44\nJust as the language of \u00a7 2021(b)(3) does not demonstrate a congressional intent to confine the statute's application to \"discriminations like discharge and demotion,\" neither does the legislative history.  When the bill, H.R. 11509, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965), that included what eventually became 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2021(b)(3) was first introduced, Subcommittee No. 3 of the House Committee on Armed Services held hearings and the full Committee thereafter reported favorably on the bill.  The Committee's Report, which reflected the hearing testimony of Hugh W. Bradley, Director of the Office of Veterans' Reemployment Rights of the Department of Labor, stated:\n\n\n45\n\"Employment practices which disadvantage employees with      Reserve obligations have become an increasing problem in      recent years.  Paragraph 1 of the bill will protect members      of the Reserve components of the Armed Forces, including the      National Guard, from such practices.  It is designed to      enable reservists and guardsmen who leave their jobs to      perform training in the Armed Forces to retain their      employment and to enjoy all of the employment opportunities      and benefits accorded their coworkers who do not . . . have a      Reserve obligation.\n\n\n46\n\"It assures that these reservists will be entitled to      the same treatment afforded their coworkers without such      military obligations . . . .\n\n\n47\n\"The law does not now protect these reservists against      discharge without cause as it does with inductees and      enlistees, who have 1-year protection, and initial active      duty for training reservists, who have 6 months' protection.\n\n\n48\n\"To give the reservist a specific period of protection      after each tour of training duty would be to perpetuate him in his position indefinitely.  The new section . . .      would not follow this approach but instead provides that an      employee shall not be denied retention in his employment or      any promotion or other incident or advantage of employment      solely because of any obligation as a member of a Reserve      component of the Armed Forces.\n\n\n49\n*          *          *          *          *\n\n\n50\n\"If these young men are essential to our national      defense, then certainly our Government and employers have a      moral obligation to see that their economic well being is      disrupted to the minimum extent possible.\"  H.R.Rep.No. 1303,      89th Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1966) (emphasis added).\n\n\n51\nAlthough the bill was passed by the House, 112 Cong.Rec. 5017 (1966), the Senate took no action on the measure during the 89th Congress.\n\n\n52\nThe bill was reintroduced in the 90th Congress.  H.R. 1093, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967);  S. 2561, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967).  Hearings again were held before Subcommittee No. 3 of the House Committee on Armed Services, at which a statement expressing the view of the American Legion was entered on the record:\n\n\n53\n\"The American Legion feels very strongly that employees      with reserve obligations who are members of the National      Guard and the Reserves . . . should be afforded all the      employment opportunities and benefits as those who do not      have training obligations . . . .\n\n\n54\n\"[The new section] would prevent discharge from      employment without cause because of membership in the      National Guard or Reserves, and would also prevent      discrimination in such areas as promotion, training      opportunities and pay increases.\"  Hearings on H.R. 1093      before Subcommittee No. 3 of the House Committee on Armed      Services, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 7477 (1968), U.S.Code Cong.      & Admin.News 1968, p. 3421 (emphasis added).\n\n\n55\nNoting that protection of \"reservists and guardsmen from being disadvantaged in employment because of their military obligations\" was one of the purposes of the bill, the full Committee's favorable Report explained that \"[s]ection (1) amplifies existing law to make clear that reservists not on active duty, who have a remaining Reserve obligation, whether acquired voluntarily or involuntarily, will nonetheless not be discriminated against by their employees [sic] soley [sic] because of such Reserve affiliation.\"  H.R.Rep.No. 1303, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1968) (emphasis added).\n\n\n56\nFollowing passage of the bill by the House, 114 Cong.Rec. 11779 (1968), the Senate Committee on Armed Services held hearings and issued a Report recommending enactment.  The Report repeated the themes which run through every congressional expression on the statutory proposal:\n\n\n57\n\"This bill is intended . . . to prevent reservists and      National Guardsmen not on active duty who must attend weekly      drills or summer training from being discriminated against in      employment because of their Reserve membership . . . .\n\n\n58\n*          *          *          *          *\n\n\n59\n\"Employment practices that discriminate against      employees with Reserve obligations have become an increasing      problem in recent years.  Some of these employees have been      denied promotions because they must attend weekly drills or      summer training and others have been discharged because of      these obligations.  Section 1 of the bill is intended to      protect members of the Reserve components of the Armed Forces      from such practices.  It provides that these reservists will      be entitled to the same treatment afforded their coworkers      not having such military obligations by requiring that      employees with Reserve obligations 'shall not be denied      retention in employment or other incident or advantage of      employment because of any obligation as a member of a Reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States.' \"      S.Rep.No. 1477, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 1-2, 3421 (1968).\n\n\n60\nThe bill passed the Senate, 114 Cong.Rec. 24017 (1968), and became law on August 17, 1968.  Pub.L. 90-491, 82 Stat. 790.\n\n\n61\nThe legislative history of \u00a7 2021(b)(3) admittedly reveals an intent to protect reservists from discharge because of their short-term absences, just as \u00a7\u00a7 2021(b)(1) and 2024(c) safeguard returning veterans and reservists who are absent for more than three months.  Yet the legislative history also indicates a more expansive congressional purpose of ensuring that reservists are not deprived of any employment benefit solely because of their willingness to serve their country.\n\nII\n\n62\nThe benefit at issue here is the opportunity to work a full 40-hour week.  Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals concluded that being scheduled to work 40 hours per week is an \"incident or advantage\" of employment established by the custom and practice at respondent's refinery.  446 F.Supp. 616, 619 (ND Ohio 1975);  613 F.2d 641, 645 (CA6 1980).  Petitioner was treated no different from other employees in terms of work scheduling, and he was given the right to exchange shifts with willing fellow employees pursuant to the collective-bargaining agreement. Nevertheless, during those weeks when his scheduled work hours conflicted with his military commitments and he was unable to arrange an exchange of shifts, the opportunity granted him to work a full 40 hours was illusory since respondent \"took no steps to provide [him] with substituted hours.\"  App. 26.  Thus, petitioner asserts that respondent violated 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2021(b)(3) by refusing to rearrange his work schedule to allow him to work 40 hours during those weeks when his military obligations otherwise precluded him from doing so.  I agree.\n\n\n63\nThe Court inaccurately characterizes petitioner's claim as seeking \"work-schedule preferences not available to other employees.\"  Ante, at 560.  Respondent's policy is not to readjust the work schedule to accommodate absences for personal reasons, and petitioner alleges no right to special consideration regarding absences unrelated to military service.  But if petitioner is to be placed on an equal footing with his co-workers, his military absences cannot be treated simply as personal leaves of absence. See Carlson v. New Hampshire Dept. of Safety, 609 F.2d 1024, 1027 (CA1 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 913, 100 S.Ct. 1844, 64 L.Ed.2d 267 (1980);  Lott v. Goodyear Aerospace Corp., 395 F.Supp. 866, 869-870 (ND Ohio 1975).  A reservist's absences for training result from obligations vital to our national defense that other employees have not assumed, and the primary purpose of the re-employment rights statutes is to protect reservists against disadvantages in employment caused by these obligations.  Indeed, the essence of the statutory guarantees provided by Congress is that employers must give special treatment to the military absences of veterans and reservists.\n\n\n64\nThe Court emphasizes that \"respondent did not deny the petitioner anything that he would have received had he not been a reservist\" since he was scheduled for 40 hours of work per week, was assigned the same burden of weekend and shift work as other employees, and was allowed to exchange shifts.  Ante, at 565.  In substance, the Court embraces the Court of Appeals' holding that \u00a7 2021(b)(3) \"merely requires that reservists be treated equally or neutrally with their fellow employees without military obligations.\"  613 F.2d, at 646.  However, unless the statute is read as safeguarding reservists from the adverse effects of facially neutral rules, much of its practical significance is lost.  As the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit observed in West v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 609 F.2d 147, 149 (1980):  \"The essence of reserve duty in this context is absence from work.  If employers could . . . require that workers be present in order to receive certain benefits, then reservists could never secure the benefits or advantages of employment which the Act was designed to protect.\"  see also Carney v. Cummins Engine Co., 602 F.2d 763 (CA7 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1073, 100 S.Ct. 1018, 62 L.Ed.2d 754 (1980).\n\n\n65\nPetitioner is not attempting to gain an advantage over his co-workers as a result of his reserve membership.  He does not assert a right to be paid for hours he does not work, but asks only that he be given the same meaningful chance as other employees without military commitments to work full time in order to earn a living wage.  Moreover, the record contains no evidence that it would be unduly burdensome for respondent, if given adequate notice, to accommodate petitioner's weekend military commitments in scheduling his work hours.  In fact, counsel for respondent acknowledged at oral argument that petitioner \"could be scheduled with the number of . . . Saturdays and Sundays off to accommodate his reserve obligation, without requiring any other employee in the plant to work any more Saturdays and Sundays than they now have to work under the regular routine.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 27.  See also App. 41-43 (proposed revision of work schedule).\n\n\n66\nThe Court states that one of the flaws in petitioner's argument is that \"there is no principled way of distinguishing between an employer's obligation to make scheduling accommodations for weekends as opposed to, for example, annual 2-week training periods, or even longer periods of training or duty.\"  Ante, at 563.  However, petitioner does not claim a right to make up hours, only to work full time during those weeks when he is available to work 40 hours apart from his reserve duties.  Far from asking respondent to do the impossible, petitioner contends only that \"reasonable steps\" must be taken to accommodate him.  Brief for Petitioner 24.  Yet it is undisputed that respondent made no effort to do so.  See App. 26.  Cf. Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63, 97 S.Ct. 2264, 53 L.Ed.2d 113 (1977).  I cannot accept the Court's conclusion that such total indifference is in keeping with the underlying purposes and express guarantees of \u00a7 2021(b)(3).\n\n\n67\nThe Court's suggestion that respondent need go no further than the requirements of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2024(d) in accommodating petitioner\u2014i. e., he must simply be provided \"a leave of absence,\" ante, at 564\u2014ignores the separate, broader protections of \u00a7 2021(b)(3), which was enacted because \u00a7 2024(d) was found to be inadequate.  In the Court's view, \"[i]f Congress had wanted to impose an additional obligation upon employers, guaranteeing that employee-reservists have the opportunity to work the same number of hours, or earn the same amount of pay that they would have earned without absences attributable to military reserve duties, it could have done so expressly.\"  Ante, at 564.  But it was respondent that conferred on its employees the benefit of 40 hours of work per week, and Congress has provided unequivocally that such a benefit cannot be refused a reservist, as it was here, solely because of his military commitments.  The plain language of \u00a7 2021(b)(3) does not differentiate among employment benefits, but \"makes it . . . explicit that a reservist or guardsman cannot be . . . denied any promotion or other employment benefit or advantage, because of any obligation arising out of his membership in the reserves [or Guard], or because of his absences from work that result from such obligation.\"  U. S. Dept. of Labor, Office of Veterans' Reemployment Rights, Veterans' Reemployment Rights Handbook 114-115 (1970) (emphasis added).\n\nIII\n\n68\nWe have held that the re-employment rights statutes are \"to be liberally construed for the benefit of those who . . . serve their country.\"  Fishgold v. Sullivan Drydock & Repair Corp., 328 U.S. 275, 285, 66 S.Ct. 1105, 1111, 90 L.Ed. 1230 (1946).  Accord, Coffy v. Republic Steel Corp., 447 U.S. 191, 196, 100 S.Ct. 2100, 2104, 65 L.Ed.2d 53 (1980);  Alabama Power Co. v. Davis, 431 U.S. 581, 584, 97 S.Ct. 2002, 2004, 52 L.Ed.2d 595 (1977).  It is unfortunate, I think, that the Court's decision today undermines that sound principle.  The clear purpose of Congress in enacting \u00a7 2021(b)(3) was to expand employment safeguards for reservists and thereby encourage participation in the Ready Reserves and the National Guard so as to strengthen our national defense effort without increased reliance on active duty personnel through mandatory military service.  Yet that aim is severely frustrated if employers can deprive reservists of \"an incident or advantage of employment\" as important as the opportunity for full-time work undiminished by weekend absences for military training.  Congress surely did not intend that petitioner be put to the choice of quitting the Reserves or forgoing the chance to earn the same wages as other employees who do not have military obligations.  Section 2021(b)(3) was enacted to prevent the very type of disadvantage that petitioner has suffered.  Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n\n1\n There is an apparent intercircuit conflict on this issue. Compare the case under review with West v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 609 F.2d 147 (CA5).\n\n\n2\n In oral argument, counsel for the respondent indicated that the petitioner was a member of the Ohio National Guard.  This is not apparent in the record, but both Ready Reservists and National Guardsmen are equally entitled to the protection of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2021(b)(3).  See S.Rep. No. 1477, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 1, 5 (1968);  H.R.Rep. No. 1303, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 3, 6 (1968), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, 1968 p. 3421.\n\n\n3\n Title 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2024(d) provides in pertinent part:\n\"Any employee . . . shall upon request be granted a leave of absence by such person's employer for the period required to perform active duty for training or inactive duty for training in the Armed Forces of the United States.  Upon such employee's release from a period of such active duty for training or inactive duty for training, . . . such employee shall be permitted to return to such employee's position with such seniority, status, pay, and vacation as such employee would have had if such employee had not been absent for such purposes. . . .\"\n\n\n4\n The Department of Justice represents the petitioner pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2022.\n\n\n5\n Section 2021(b)(3) provides:\n\"Any person who holds a position described in clause (A) or (B) of subsection (a) of this section shall not be denied retention in employment or any promotion or other incident or advantage of employment because of any obligation as a member of a Reserve component of the Armed Forces.\"\n\n\n6\n The petitioner does not urge here that he had to be paid for hours not worked.\n\n\n7\n There is no dispute that the respondent has complied with all relevant requirements of \u00a7 2024(d).  See n. 3, supra.  This section compels employers to grant leaves of absence to employees who must attend reserve training, and entitles a reservist who has been absent for inactive reserve training to benefits upon his return, such as wage rates and seniority, which automatically would have accrued if he had remained in the continuous service of his employer.  See Aiello v. Detroit Free Press, Inc., 570 F.2d 145, 148 (CA6).  It does not entitle a reservist to benefits that are conditioned upon work requirements demanding actual performance on the job.  See ibid.  See also Foster v. Dravo Corp., 420 U.S. 92, 95 S.Ct. 879, 43 L.Ed.2d 44.  Thus, it is not contended that \u00a7 2024(d) requires employers to pay absent reservists for hours not worked.\n\n\n8\n Before their recodification in 1974, the veterans' re-employment rights provisions were codified at 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 459 (1970 ed.) (\u00a7 9 of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967).  See Coffy v. Republic Steel Corp., 447 U.S. 191, 194, n. 2, 100 S.Ct. 2100, 2103, n. 2, 65 L.Ed.2d 53.\n\n\n9\n Section 2021(a) provides as follows:\n\"In the case of any person who is inducted into the Armed Forces of the United States under the Military Selective Service Act [50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7\u00a7 451-473] (or under any prior or subsequent corresponding law) for training and service and who leaves a position (other than a temporary position) in the employ of any employer in order to perform such training and service;  and (1) receives a certificate described in section 9(a) of the Military Selective Service Act [50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 459(a)] (relating to the satisfactory completion of military service), and (2) makes application for reemployment within ninety days after such person is relieved from such training and service or from hospitalization continuing after discharge for a period of not more than one year\u2014\n\"(A) if such position was in the employ of the United States Government, its territories, or possessions, or political subdivisions thereof, or the District of Columbia, such person shall\u2014\n\"(i) if still qualified to perform the duties of such position, be restored to such position or to a position of like seniority, status, and pay;  or\n\"(ii) if not qualified to perform the duties of such position, by reason of disability sustained during such service, but qualified to perform the duties of any other position in the employ of the employer, be offered employment and, if such person so requests, be employed in such other position the duties of which such person is qualified to perform as will provide such person like seniority, status, and pay, or the nearest approximation thereof consistent with the circumstances in such person's case;\n\"(B) if such position was in the employ of a State, or political subdivision thereof, or a private employer, such employee shall\u2014\n\"(i) if still qualified to perform the duties of such position, be restored by such employer or the employer's successor in interest to such position or to a position of like seniority, status, and pay;  or\n\"(ii) [as in (A)(ii), supra, except for references to the 'employer's successor in interest'].\"\n\n\n10\n The bill that included what became 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2021(b)(3) was introduced in the 89th Congress.  H. R. 11509, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965).  Hearings were held before Subcommittee No. 3 of the House Committee on Armed Services in February 1966.  Hearings on H. R. 11509 before Subcommittee No. 3 of the House Committee on Armed Services, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1966) (hereafter 1966 House Hearings).  The bill was favorably reported by the full Committee, H. R. Rep. No. 1303, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. (1966), and was passed by the House on March 7, 1966, 112 Cong.Rec. 5016 (1966).  No action, however, was taken on the measure by the Senate in the 89th Congress.\nThe bill was reintroduced in the 90th Congress.  H. R. 1093, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967);  S. 2561, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967).  Hearings were again held before Subcommittee No. 3 of the House Committee, on March 20, 1968.  Hearings on H. R. 1093 before Subcommittee No. 3 of the House Committee on Armed Services, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1968) (hereafter 1968 House Hearings).  The bill was favorably reported by the full Committee on April 24, 1968, H. R. Rep. No. 1303, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. (1968), and initially passed by the House on May 6, 1968, 114 Cong.Rec. 11779 (1968). Hearings were held by the Senate Committee on Armed Services on July 25, 1968.  Hearings on H. R. 1093 before Senate Committee on Armed Services, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. (1968) (hereafter 1968 Senate Hearings).  The bill was favorably reported by the Committee, S. Rep. No. 1477, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. (1968), on July 26, 1968, and passed the Senate on July 29, 1968, 114 Cong.Rec. 24017 (1968). The Senate concurred in the House amendment.  Id., at 24999.  The bill was signed into law on August 17, 1968.  Pub. L. 90-491, 82 Stat. 790.\nThe language of that portion of the bill which became \u00a7 2021(b)(3) was unchanged throughout its legislative consideration. There was no substantive discussion of the measure on the floor of either chamber.  Accordingly, the key portions of the legislative history are the three hearings held on the proposed measure and the three Committee Reports.\n\n\n11\n This same purpose was reflected in a statement in support of the legislation by Austin E. Kerby, the Director of the National Economic Commission of the American Legion:\n\"The American Legion feels very strongly that employees with reserve obligations who are members of the National Guard and the Reserves should not be denied retention in employment or promotional opportunities solely because of their participation in the Reserve Training Program.  They should be afforded all the employment opportunities and benefits as those who do not have training obligations.  The Reemployment Rights Statutes do not now protect National Guard members and Reservists as it does inductees and enlistees, who have one-year protection, and initial active duty for training reservists who have six-months protection.\n\"H. R. 1093 [H. R. 11509 as reintroduced in the 90th Congress, see n. 10, supra] would add a new section, 9(c)(3), under the reemployment provisions of the Universal Military Training and Service Act which would prevent discharge from employment without cause because of membership in the National Guard or Reserves, and would also prevent discrimination in such areas as promotion, training opportunities and pay increases.\" 1968 Hearings, at 7477 (emphasis added).\n\n\n12\n One could argue, of course, that \"protection . . . against certain types of discharges or demotions that might rob the veteran's reemployment of its substance,\" Oakley v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 338 U.S. 278, 285, 70 S.Ct. 119, 123, 94 L.Ed. 87 (in reference to \u00a7 2021(b)(2) but equally relevant here) amounts to preferential treatment.  But this sort of treatment, clearly intended by the statute and its legislative history, is better understood as protection against discrimination that would not have occurred were it not for reserve obligations, than as preferential treatment accorded solely because of reserve status.\n\n\n13\n The legislative history is barren of any indication that Congress intended employers to compensate employees for work hours missed while fulfilling military reserve obligations, which would of course amount to employee receipt of double compensation for such periods.\n\n\n14\n The Veterans' Reemployment Rights Handbook, published by the Office of Veterans' Reemployment Rights in 1970 and still in use today, notes that \"[t]he law does not require the employer to pay the employee for the time he is absent for military training duty, or even to make up the difference between his military pay and his regular earnings for that period.  In this respect, of course, many employers have adopted voluntary policies or contractual obligations, or are subject to State statutes, which give reservists and guardsmen more than the statute [38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2021 et seq.] requires.\"  Id., at 113.  And in the many examples in the Handbook addressed to typical problems an employer may confront because of employee military obligations, there is not so much as a hint that an employer has an obligation to adjust an employee's work schedule to make up for time lost because of military obligations.\n\n\n15\n Section 403 of the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, Pub. L. 93-508, 88 Stat. 1594, for example, made specific revisions to the existing provisions of the veterans' re-employment rights laws that impose explicit obligations upon employers with respect to certain disabled veterans of the Vietnam era.  38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2012.

Dortha Allen GUY, Petitioner,  v.  ROBBINS & MYERS, INC., et al.\nNos. 75-1264, 75-1276.\nArgued Nov. 9, 1976.\nDecided Dec. 20, 1976.\n\nSyllabus\nTwo days after her discharge by respondent company, petitioner Guy, a Negro, caused a grievance alleging \"unfair action\" to be filed on her behalf pursuant to procedures in a collective-bargaining agreement between her union and respondent. On February 10, 1972, 84 days after the company under those procedures had denied the grievance, but 108 days after the discharge, petitioner Guy filed a charge of racial discrimination relating to her discharge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which in November 1973 concluded that race had not figured in the discharge. Petitioner Guy then brought this suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the District Court, which thereafter dismissed the suit on the ground that Guy had not filed her charge with the EEOC within 90 days \"after the alleged unlawful practice occurred,\" as required by \u00a7 706(d) (a period later extended to 180 days when, effective March 24, 1972, the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 amended the limitations provision), and that Guy's resort to the contractual grievance procedure did not extend the time in which to file the Title VII charge. Section 14 of the 1972 amendments provides that the amendments \"shall be applicable with respect to charges pending with the Commission on the date of the enactment of this Act and all charges filed thereafter.\" The Court of Appeals, which affirmed, also concluded that the extension of 180 days could not \"revive\" a claim that was \"barred and extinguished\" before the extension's effective date. Held:\n1. Petitioners' contention, raised explicitly for the first time in this Court, that the date of the conclusion of the grievance procedures, not the date of the discharge, was the \"final\" date of \"the alleged unlawful practice,\" is without merit as being contrary to the understanding of the parties themselves in the courts below. Pp. 234-235.\n2. The existence and utilization of grievance procedures does not toll the running of the limitations period that would otherwise begin on the date of the firing, Title VII remedies being independent of other pre-existing remedies available to an aggrieved employee. Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 39 L.Ed.2d 147; Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, 421 U.S. 454, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295. Pp. 236-240.\n(a) Petitioner Guy, by pursuing the grievance procedures, was asserting an independent claim based on a contract right and was in no way thereby prevented from filing her charge with the EEOC within 90 days of her discharge. Application of equitable principles to toll the 90-day period pending completion of the grievance procedures is therefore inappropriate here. Burnett v. New York Central R. Co., 380 U.S. 424, 85 S.Ct. 1050, 13 L.Ed.2d 941, distinguished. Pp. 237-238.\n(b) Congress clearly intended to retain other remedies \"against private employment discrimination separate from and independent of the more elaborate and time-consuming procedures of Title VII,\" Johnson v. Railway Express Co., supra, 421 U.S. at 465-466, 95 S.Ct. at 1722-1723. Pp. 239-240.\n3. The 1972 amendments and their legislative history demonstrate that Congress intended to apply the 180-day period to a charge such as that filed by Guy where the charge was filed with the EEOC before these amendments became effective, was still pending when the amendments became effective, and alleged a discriminatory occurrence within 180 days of the enactment of the amendment. Pp. 241-243.\n4. Lifting the bar of a statute of limitations so as to restore a remedy lost through mere lapse of time is not per se unconstitutional. Cf. Chase Securities Corp. v. Donaldson, 325 U.S. 304, 311-312, 65 S.Ct. 1137, 1141, 89 L.Ed. 1628. Pp. 243-244.\n6 Cir., 525 F.2d 124, reversed and remanded.\nWinn Newman, Washington, D. C., for petitioners.\nFletcher L. Hudson, Memphis, Tenn., for respondents pro hac vice, by special leave of Court.\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nPetitioners seek review of a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit holding that a claim brought by petitioner Dortha Guy under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was barred by her failure to file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within the statutory limitations period. They present three contentions: The existence and utilization of grievance procedures postpone the date on which an allegedly discriminatory firing took place; the existence and utilization of grievance procedures toll the running of the limitations period which would otherwise begin on the date of the firing; and the 1972 amendments to Title VII, Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 103 (Mar. 24, 1972), extending the limitations period from 90 to 180 days, apply to the charge in this case.\n\n\n2\n* Respondent Robbins & Myers, Inc. (hereinafter respondent), terminated the employment of petitioner Guy on October 25, 1971, and assigned as its reason for doing so her failure to comply with procedures contained in the collective-bargaining agreement pertaining to leaves of absence. Two days later petitioner caused a grievance alleging an \"unfair action\" of the company in firing her to be filed on her behalf in accordance with the provisions of the collective-bargaining agreement then in force between petitioner Local 790 of the International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (Local 790) and respondent. That agreement's dispute-resolution procedure, which is to be commenced within \"five (5) working days of the commission of the act originating the grievance,\" consists of three grievance steps followed by one arbitration step. Guy's grievance was processed through the third step of the grievance procedure where it was denied on November 18, 1971, with the finding that her termination had been in accordance with the provisions of the collective-bargaining agreement.\n\n\n3\nOn February 10, 1972, a date 84 days after the denial of her grievance at the third stage, but 108 days after the date of her discharge, Guy, who is black, filed a charge of racial discrimination with the EEOC directed against both respondent and Local 790. The EEOC in November 1973, issued its determination and \"right to sue\" letter, finding that there was \"no reason to believe that race was a factor in the decision to discharge\" Guy. Her suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5, was met by a motion to dismiss on the ground, inter alia, that it was barred because of her failure to file a charge with the EEOC within 90 days of her discharge, \u00a7 706(d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(d).1 The District Court dismissed her action,2 and the Court of Appeals affirmed that judgment by a divided vote, 6 Cir., 525 F.2d 124 (1975). That court felt that it would be \"utterly inconsistent\" with our opinions in Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, 421 U.S. 454, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975) and in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974), to hold that the pursuit of a contractual grievance procedure operates to toll a Title VII remedy \"which the employee has a right to resort to concurrently.\" 525 F.2d at 126. Then, noting the question of the applicability of the 1972 amendments to Title VII raised by the EEOC as amicus curiae (also noting without more that \"(s)ince this issue was not raised in the District Court by any party to the case, we are not required to consider it\"), the Court of Appeals stated:\n\n\n4\n\"Plaintiff Guy's claim was barred on January 24, 1972. She      did not file her charge with EEOC until February 10, 1972.      The amendments to Title VII, increasing the time within which      to file her charge to 180 days, did not become effective      until March 24, 1972. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e) (1970 ed., Supp.      V). The subsequent increase of time to file the charge      enacted by Congress could not revive plaintiff's claim which      had been previously barred and extinguished.\" 525 F.2d, at      128.\n\n\n5\nThe dissenting judge disagreed on this point, believing that the case should be remanded for consideration of the effect of the 1972 amendments.\n\n\n6\nWe granted certiorari, 425 U.S. 950, 96 S.Ct. 1723, 48 L.Ed.2d 193, to resolve an apparent Circuit conflict on two of these issues: tolling during the pendency of a collective-bargaining-contract's grievance mechanism,3 and the applicability of the 1972 amendments to charges filed more than 90 days from the date of the alleged discriminatory act but less than 180 days before the time the amendments became effective.\n\nII\n\n7\nBefore reaching either of those questions, however, petitioners Guy and Local 790 assert that the complaint with the EEOC was timely filed, not because of any tolling concept, but simply because the date \"the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred\" is the date of the conclusion of the collective-bargaining agreement's grievance-arbitration procedures. Until that time, we are told, the October 25 discharge of Guy (although itself an \"occurrence\" allowing immediate resort to the EEOC) was \"tentative\" and \"non-final,\" and remained so until she terminated the grievance and arbitration process, at which time the \"final\" occurrence transpired.4 As a consequence, according to petitioners, the unfavorable termination of the grievance procedures, making the discharge \"final,\" constituted an \"occurrence\" enabling Guy to start the 90-day period running from that date.\n\n\n8\nWhile the parties could conceivably have agreed to a contract under which management's ultimate adoption of a supervisor's recommendation would be deemed the relevant statutory \"occurrence,\" this was not such a contract. For all that appears Guy was fired as of October 25, 1971, and all parties so understood. She stopped work and ceased receiving pay and benefits as of that date. Unless the grievance procedures resulted in her reinstatement, she would not be entitled to be paid for the period during which the grievance procedures were being implemented.5 The grievance lodged on October 27, 1971, protests the \"unfair action of Co. for discharge\" (emphasis added), while the complaint filed in the District Court alleges Guy's disagreement, after learning of her discharge, \"with the Company's determination that she had 'voluntarily quit,' \" (emphasis added). Throughout the proceedings both in the District Court and in the Court of Appeals, both sides appear to have assumed, as did the courts, that the date of discharge was October 25, 1971. There being no indication that either party viewed the October 25 discharge as anything other than \"final,\"6 there is certainly no reason for us to now torture this mutual understanding by accepting the bare assertions to the contrary raised by petitioners for the first time before this Court.7\n\nIII\n\n9\nWe think that petitioners' arguments for tolling the statutory period for filing a claim with the EEOC during the pendency of grievance or arbitration procedures under the collective-bargaining contract are virtually foreclosed by our decisions in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974), and in Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, 421 U.S. 454, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975). In Alexander we held that an arbitrator's decision pursuant to provisions in a collective-bargaining contract was not binding on an individual seeking to pursue his Title VII remedies in court. We reasoned that the contractual rights under a collective-bargaining agreement and the statutory right provided by Congress under Title VII \"have legally independent origins and are equally available to the aggrieved employee,\" 415 U.S., at 52, 94 S.Ct. at 1022,8 and for that reason we concluded:\n\n\n10\n\"(I)n instituting an action under Title VII, the employee is      not seeking review of the arbitrator's decision. Rather, he      is asserting a statutory right independent of the arbitration      process.\" Id., at 54, 94 S.Ct. at 1022.\n\n\n11\nOne Term later, we reaffirmed the independence of Title VII remedies from other pre-existing remedies available to an aggrieved employee. In Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, we held that the timely filing of a charge with the EEOC pursuant to \u00a7 706 of Title VII did not toll the running of the statute of limitations applicable to an action, based on the same facts, brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. In reaffirming the independence of Title VII remedies from other remedies, we noted that such independence might occasionally be a two-edged sword,9 but \"in the face of congressional emphasis upon the existence and independence of the two remedies,\" we were disinclined \"to infer any positive preference for one over the other, without a more definite expression in the legislation Congress has enacted,\" 421 U.S., at 461, 95 S.Ct. at 1720.\n\n\n12\nPetitioners insist that notwithstanding these decisions, equitable tolling principles should be applied to this litigation, and that the application of such principles would toll the 90-day period pending completion of the grievance procedures. This is so, they say, because here the \"policy of repose, designed to protect defendants.\" Burnett v. New York Central R. Co., 380 U.S. 424, 428, 85 S.Ct. 1050, 1055, 13 L.Ed.2d 941 (1965), is \"outweighed (because) the interests of justice require vindication of the plaintiff's rights.\"\n\n\n13\nBut this is quite a different situation from Burnett, supra.10 There the plaintiff in a Federal Employers' Liability Act action had asserted his FELA claim in the state courts, which had concurrent jurisdiction with the federal courts, but he had the misfortune of filing his complaint in an Ohio State court where venue did not lie under Ohio law. This Court held that such a filing was sufficient to toll the statutory limitations period, even though the state-court action was dismissed for improper venue and a new complaint ultimately filed in the United States District Court. The Court said:\n\n\n14\n\"Petitioner here did not sleep on his rights but brought an      action within the statutory period in the state court of      competent jurisdiction. Service of process was made upon the      respondent notifying him that petitioner was asserting his      cause of action.\" Id., at 429, 85 S.Ct. at 1055.\n\n\n15\nHere petitioner Guy in the grievance proceedings was not asserting the same statutory claim in a different forum, nor giving notice to respondent of that statutory claim, but was asserting an independent claim based on a contract right, Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., supra, 415 U.S. at 53-54, 56-58, 94 S.Ct. at 1022. Burnett cannot aid this petitioner, see Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, supra, 421 U.S. at 467, and n. 14, 95 S.Ct. at 1724.11\n\n\n16\nPetitioners advance as a corollary argument for tolling the premise that substantial policy considerations, based on the central role of arbitration in labor-management relations, see Steelworkers v. American Mfg. Co., 363 U.S. 564, 80 S.Ct. 1343, 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1960); Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448, 77 S.Ct. 912, 1 L.Ed.2d 972 (1957), also dictate a finding that the Title VII limitations period is tolled in this situation. Similar arguments by the employer in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., urging the superiority and pre-eminence of the arbitration process were rejected by us in that case, and we find the reasoning of that case controlling in rejecting this claim made by petitioners.\n\n\n17\nPetitioners also advance a related argument that the danger of possible conflict between the concurrent pursuit of both collective-bargaining and Title VII remedies should result in tolling the limitations period for the latter while the former proceeds to conclusion. Similar arguments to these, albeit relating to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and not to private labor agreements, were, however, raised and rejected in Johnson. We think the language we used in that case is sufficient to dispose of this claim:\n\n\n18\n\"(I)t is conceivable, and perhaps almost to be expected, that      failure to toll will have the effect of pressing a civil      rights complainant who values his \u00a7 1981 claim into court      before the EEOC has completed its administrative proceeding.      One answer to this, although perhaps not a highly      satisfactory one, is that the plaintiff in his \u00a7 1981 suit      may ask the court to stay proceedings until the      administrative efforts at conciliation and voluntary      compliance have been completed. But the fundamental answer to      petitioner's argument lies in the fact presumably a happy one      for the civil rights claimant that Congress clearly has      retained \u00a7 1981 as a remedy against private employment      discrimination separate from and independent of the more      elaborate and time consuming procedures of Title VII.\" 421      U.S., at 465-466, 95 S.Ct. at 1722.\n\n\n19\nPetitioners contend at some length that tolling would impose almost no costs, as the delays occasioned by the grievance-arbitration process would be \"slight,\"12 noting that the maximum delay in invoking the three-stage grievance procedure (although not including the arbitration step) under the collective-bargaining agreement in force in this case would be 35 days. But the principal answer to this contention is that Congress has already spoken with respect to what it considers acceptable delay when it established a 90-day limitations period, and gave no indication that it considered a \"slight\" delay followed by 90 days equally acceptable. In defining Title VII's jurisdictional prerequisites \"with precision,\" Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S., at 47, 94 S.Ct., at 1019, Congress did not leave to courts the decision as to which delays might or might not be \"slight.\"13\n\n\n20\nCongress did provide in \u00a7 706(b) one exception for this 90-day limitations period, when it provided that the limitations period should run for a maximum additional 120 days when there existed \"a State or local law prohibiting the unlawful employment practice alleged and establishing or authorizing a State or local authority to grant or seek relief from such practice or to institute criminal proceedings with respect thereto upon receiving notice thereof.\" Where Congress has spoken with respect to a claim much more closely related to the Title VII claim than is the contractual claim pursued under the grievance procedure, and then firmly limited the maximum possible extension of the limitations period applicable thereto, we think that all of petitioners' arguments taken together simply do not carry sufficient weight to overcome the negative implication from the language used by Congress, cf. Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, 421 U.S., at 461, 95 S.Ct., at 1720.14\n\nIV\n\n21\nGuy filed her charge with the EEOC on February 10, 1972, 108 days after her October 25, 1971, discharge. On March 24, 1972, the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 103, extended to 180 days the time within which to file a claim with the EEOC, \u00a7 706(e). Petitioners contend that this expanded limitations period should apply to Guy's charge as the occurrence she was complaining of took place within 180 days of the enactment of the 1972 amendments. We agree.\n\n\n22\nSection 14 of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 113, states:\n\n\n23\n\"The amendments made by this Act to section 706 of the Civil      Rights Act of 1964 shall be applicable with respect to      charges pending with the Commission on the date of enactment      of this Act and all charges filed thereafter.\"\n\n\n24\nRespondent asserts that \u00a7 14, which was added by amendment to the bill on the floor of the House by Senator Javits, 118 Cong.Rec. 4816 (1972), was designed for the sole purpose of having the new enforcement powers given to the EEOC apply to pending charges, see letter of Feb. 14, 1972, from David L. Norman, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, to Senator Dominick, quoted in EEOC v. Christiansburg Garment Co., 376 F.Supp. 1067, 1074 (W.D. Va.1974). However, the explicit statutory language used applies to all amendments made by the Act to \u00a7 706, not simply to the new enforcement provisions. As Senator Javits did not limit his remarks on the floor so as to indicate that \u00a7 14's retroactivity was designed to apply only to the new enforcement provisions,15 the legislative history does not make this one of those unusual cases in which a court may infer, contrary to the language actually used, that Congress intended to so limit the scope of \u00a7 14, cf. also S.Rep.No.91-1137, p. 31 (1970).\n\n\n25\nRespondent also contends that the amendment is not applicable to the charge filed by Guy with the EEOC, since, being untimely when filed, her charge could not have been \"pending with the Commission on the date of enactment of this Act.\" This reading of \"pending\" confining it to charges still before the Commission and timely when filed is not the only possible meaning of the word, is largely rebutted by the legislative history,16 and renders the language of \u00a7 14 virtually meaningless insofar as the enlarged limitations period is concerned. Since Congress also applied the enlarged limitations period to charges, whether or not untimely on March 24, \"filed thereafter,\" we should not presume Congress created this odd hiatus in retroactivity suggested by respondent unless congressional intent to do so was conveyed by language more precise than \"pending,\" cf. Love v. Pullman Co., 404 U.S. 522, 92 S.Ct. 616, 30 L.Ed.2d 679 (1972). \"Pending\" is simply not a term of art that unambiguously carries with it a meaning precisely suited for this situation; equally logical, for example, would be an interpretation that read \"pending\" to mean \"filed and not yet rejected,\" cf. Legis.Hist., supra, n. 16, at 1851. We hold that Congress intended the 180-day period to be applicable to charges such as that filed by Guy, where the charge was filed with the EEOC prior to March 24, 1972, and alleged a discriminatory occurrence within 180 days of the enactment of the Act.17\n\n\n26\nRespondent contends, finally, that Congress was without constitutional power to revive, by enactment, an action which, when filed, is already barred by the running of a limitations period. This contention rests on an unwarrantedly broad reading of our opinion in William Danzer Co. v. Gulf & Ship Island R. Co., 268 U.S. 633, 45 S.Ct. 612, 69 L.Ed. 1126 (1925). Danzer was given a narrow reading in the later case of Chase Securities Corp. v. Donaldson, 325 U.S. 304, 312, n. 8, 65 S.Ct. 1137, 1141, 89 L.Ed. 1628 (1945). The latter case states the applicable constitutional test in this language:\n\n\n27\n\"The Fourteenth Amendment does not make an act of state      legislation void merely because it has some retrospective      operation. What it does forbid is taking of life, liberty or      property without due process of law. . . . Assuming that      statutes of limitation, like other types of legislation,      could be so manipulated that their retroactive effects would      offend the Constitution, certainly it cannot be said that      lifting the bar of a statute of limitation so as to restore a remedy lost through      mere lapse of time is per se an offense against the      Fourteenth Amendment.\" Id., at 315-316, 65 S.Ct., at 1143.\n\n\n28\nApplying that test to this litigation, we think that Congress might constitutionally provide for retroactive application of the extended limitations period which it enacted.\n\n\n29\nWe thus resolve against petitioners their first two contentions, but resolve the third in their favor. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is therefore reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n30\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n31\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, Mr. Justice STEWART, Mr. Justice MARSHALL, and Mr. Justice STEVENS agree that the expanded 180-day limitations period enacted by 86 Stat. 103 applied to Guy's charge and would reverse the Court of Appeals on that ground without addressing the questions discussed in Parts II and III of the Court's opinion.\n\n\n\n1\n At the time of her discharge, and at the time the charge was filed with the EEOC, \u00a7 706(d) stated, in pertinent part: \"A charge under subsection (a) (of this section) shall be filed within ninety days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred . . . .\" Section 706(d) was renumbered as \u00a7 706(e), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e) (1970 ed., Supp. V), as a result of the 1972 amendments to the Act. Whenever \u00a7 706(d) is cited in this opinion, it refers to the pre-1972 version of what is now \u00a7 706(e).\n\n\n2\n Guy also alleged a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. By order dated May 30, 1974, the District Court dismissed this cause of action because of a failure to meet the applicable Tennessee statute of limitations. No appeal was taken from this decision.\n\n\n3\n The question of the tolling of Title VII's limitations period during the pendency of grievance proceedings was noted in our opinion in McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. 273, 277-278, 96 S.Ct. 2574, 2576-2578, 49 L.Ed.2d 493 (1976), but had not been decided in the lower courts, and was not presented for us to decide.\n\n\n4\n This assertion, which is also adopted by the EEOC as amicus curiae, is premised on the proposition that \"(u)se of the grievance resolution process is not an 'appeal' of a 'final' decision, but is a method of obtaining the judgment of higher management on whether the employee should be retained,\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21; Brief for Petitioner Local 790 pp. 17-18.\n\n\n5\n Tr. of Oral Arg., at 14. Nor is there any indication that, should the grievance mechanism not be utilized, any sort of \"formalized\" final determination by management was required before Guy's discharge would have been considered final. As the EEOC acknowledges, \"the employer's foremen usually can fire an individual employee such as Guy,\" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19.\n\n\n6\n Even while raising the contrary arguments in their briefs before this Court, petitioners place the October 25 discharge as the action of respondent. See, e. g., Brief for Petitioner Local 790 p. 4 (\"The following day (October 25, 1971) the Company discharged her on the ground that she had not complied with procedures embodied in the collective bargaining agreement pertaining to return from leaves of absence\"); Brief for Petitioner Guy 5 (\"The Company discharged Guy on October 25 for having 'voluntarily quit' \").\n\n\n7\n At oral argument, we were told that while this assertion was not articulated as a separate argument before the Court of Appeals, pertinent language in Moore v. Sunbeam Corp., 459 F.2d 811 (C.A.7 1972), was cited to that court, Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-12. This is hardly a precise way to get an issue before a Court of Appeals, and there is no indication that the Court of Appeals recognized any such implicit contention, assuming, arguendo, that petitioners thought they were raising it.\n\n\n8\n See also 415 U.S., at 48-49, 94 S.Ct., at 1020: \"Title VII was designed to supplement, rather than supplant, existing laws and institutions relating to employment discrimination.\" We felt that the legislative history was quite clear in this respect, see, e. g., 110 Cong.Rec. 7205, 13650-13652 (1964); H.R. 9247, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. (1971); H.R.Rep.No.92-238 (1971); S.Rep.No.92-415, p. 24 (1971).\n\n\n9\n \"Conciliation and persuasion through the administrative process (e. g., Title VII), to be sure, often constitute a desirable approach to settlement of disputes based on sensitive and emotional charges of invidious employment discrimination. We recognize, too, that the filing of a lawsuit might tend to deter efforts at conciliation, that lack of success in the legal action could weaken the Commission's efforts to induce voluntary compliance, and that a suit is privately oriented and narrow, rather than broad, in application, as successful conciliation tends to be. But these are the natural effects of the choice Congress has made available to the claimant by its conferring upon him independent administrative and judicial remedies. The choice is a valuable one,\" 421 U.S., at 461, 95 S.Ct., at 1720.\n\n\n10\n In no way is this a situation in which a party has \"been prevented from asserting\" his or her rights, Burnett v. New York Central R. Co., 380 U.S., at 429, 85 S.Ct., at 1055. There is no assertion that Guy was \"prevented\" from filing a charge with the EEOC within 90 days of October 25, 1971; indeed, it is conceded and even urged that she could have filed it the following day, had she so wished.\n\n\n11\n We concluded in Johnson that \"(o)nly where there is complete identity of the causes of action will the protections suggested by petitioner necessarily exist and will the courts have an opportunity to assess the influence of the policy of repose inherent in a limitations period,\" 421 U.S., at 468 n. 14, 95 S.Ct., at 1724. See n. 14, infra.\n\n\n12\n Petitioners contend that the vast majority of collective-bargaining agreements have stringent time restrictions on the resolution of disputes through the grievance stages, see, e. g., Brief for Petitioner Local 790, pp. 38-39; see also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23 n. 13.\n\n\n13\n Even taken on its own ground, this argument is not unambiguously favorable to petitioners. If the collective-bargaining dispute-settlement procedures are as speedy as suggested, no real need for tolling has been shown. In the instant case, for example, at the conclusion of stage three of the grievance procedure, Guy still had 66 days in which to file a charge with the EEOC, and no reason has been advanced as to why this was not ample time.\n\n\n14\n Adherence to the limitations period assures prompt notification to the employer of a charge of an alleged violation of Title VII, see \u00a7 706(b). The grievance process assures no such comparable notice. In the instant case, the grievance alleged only an \"unfair action.\" Even if racial discrimination is explicitly discussed, however, the grievance procedure properly involves only contractual questions, and would but fortuitously implicate the Title VII standards, Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S., at 53-54, 56-58, 94 S.Ct., at 1022; see also Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, 421 U.S., at 467-468, n. 14, 95 S.Ct., at 1724. Petitioners' arguments respecting the policies behind private resolution of labor disputes through collective bargaining, moreover, apply equally to the arbitration stage as they do to the grievance stage, cf. Emporium Capwell Co. v. Community Org., 420 U.S. 50, 66-67, 95 S.Ct. 977, 987, 43 L.Ed.2d 12 (1975); Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., supra, 415 U.S., at 56, 59-60, 94 S.Ct., at 1025; Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerk's Union, 398 U.S. 235, 90 S.Ct. 1583, 26 L.Ed.2d 199 (1970). Yet, at the arbitration stage the assurance of but a \"slight\" delay is lacking.\n\n\n15\n Indeed, the comment of Senator Javits implied precisely the opposite:\n\"MR. JAVITS. Mr. President, this amendment would make whatever we do enact into law applicable to pending cases. The Department of Justice has requested it in a letter to the minority leader; that is my reason for offering it.\" 118 Cong.Rec. 4816 (1972).\n\n\n16\n Section 14 was stated to be designed to cover \"charges filed with the Commission prior to the effective date of the Act,\" Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., Legislative History of Equal Employment Act of 1972, p. 1851 (Comm.Print 1972); see also id., at 1777.\n\n\n17\n Accordingly, we need not decide whether the enlarged limitations period also redounds to the benefit of persons who filed a charge more than 90, but less than 180, days from the date of the alleged \"occurrence,\" where the 180 days had run prior to March 24, 1972.\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"330 U.S. 724\n67 S.Ct. 1004\n91 L.Ed. 1204\nUNITED STATESv.HOY.\nNo. 585.\nArgued and Submitted March 14, 1947.\nDecided April 7, 1947.\n\nAppeal from the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of California.\nMr. Peyton Ford, of Washington, D.C., for appellant.\nMr. Henry G. Bodkin, of Los Angeles, Cal., for appellee.\nMr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nA United States Attorney filed an information in a Federal District Court charging that the appellee, Lem Hoy, 'did attempt to induce, assist, encourage, and solicit, certain alien persons to migrate to the United States as contract laborers * * * who were not alien contract laborers duly entitled to migrate to the United States under the Act of February 5, 1917, or to enter or migrate to the United States under any other law of the United States, as the defendant then and there well knew.' The conduct charged was made an offense by \u00a7 5 of the 1917 Immigration Act referred to in the information. 39 Stat. 874, 879, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 139, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 139. Hoy appeared, waived indictment, asked for a bill of particulars, and moved to dismiss the information on the ground that \u00a7 5 of the 1917 Act had been repealed by \u00a7 5(g) of the Farm Labor Supply Appropriation Act of 1944. 58 Stat. 11, 15, 16, 50 U.S.C.App., Supp. V, \u00a7 1355(g), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 1355(g). The bill of particulars showed that Hoy had written a letter to certain persons living in Mexico to induce them to come to the United States to work for him. In the letter Hoy told them that 'it makes no difference if you pass as contraband (smuggle in), as whenever the Immigration catches you I will get you out with a bond.' The letter also directed the aliens to see a man near the border who would 'bring' them to Hoy for $25, and stated that Hoy would 'arrange everything.' It was stipulated that Hoy wanted the men to work for him as agricultural laborers.\n\n\n2\nHolding that the 1944 Farm Labor Act had made the 1917 Act inapplicable to such farm laborers, and therefore to those who induced their entry, the District Court dismissed the information. Since this dismissal was based on the construction of the 1917 Act as the Government sought to apply it in the information, the case is properly here on direct appeal from the District Court. 18 U.S.C. Supp. V \u00a7 682, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 682; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 345, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 345.\n\n\n3\nThe 1944 Farm Labor Act, by its terms, was designed to facilitate the war-time employment, and therefore the immigration into the United States for a limited stay, of agricultural laborers from North, South, and Central America, and islands adjacent thereto. In determining whether this information was properly dismissed, it is appropriate for us to consider whether Congress intended in the 1944 Act to remove all restrictions, enforceable by sanctions, against immigration into the United States of such agricultural laborers from the western hemisphere; and at the same time whether it intended to repeal, not only the provision which prohibited contract laborers from entering the country, but also, the longstanding law which made it a criminal offense to induce such persons, barred by law, to enter.1 If the 1944 Act has these effects, it marks a complete reversal of the congressional policy which has been followed for more than half a century.2\n\n\n4\nIn line with this policy, the purpose of the 1917 Act, according to its title, was 'To regulate the immigration of aliens to, and the residence of aliens in, the United States.' It provided detailed qualifications for persons to be admitted to the country. Certain persons were to be completely barred, such as idiots, epileptics, chronic alcoholics, vagrants, criminals, polygamists, prostitutes, persons afflicted with loathsome or dangerous contagious diseases, persons who advise, advocate, or teach opposition to organized government or its overthrow by force, illiterates, and contract laborers, defined as persons induced or encouraged to come to this country by offers or promises of employment. The 1917 Act further provided for deportation of improperly admitted aliens, and authorized the promulgation of regulations to enforce the various provisions looking to exclusion of all persons except those qualified to enter the United States under the prescribed statutory standards. Pursuant to the broad terms of the 1917 and other supplementary Acts, a bureau of immigration and naturalization, now a part of the Department of Justice, has been established to examine the qualifications of those seeking admission and otherwise to enforce and administer the immigration laws in the interior and at the borders.3\n\n\n5\nThe 1944 Farm Labor Act does not on its face purport to relax the standards of the 1917 and other Acts, except in a very limited way. It does not abolish the screening, administrative and enforcement function of the immigration authorities. Indeed the sponsor of the bill on the Senate floor explained that the measure proposed made certain, by provision for strict control of immigration and immigrants, that the stay of workers admitted pursuant to its provisions would be wholly temporary, and that 'we' who sponsored the bill 'are not in any way interfering with the firmly established national immigration policy.'4\n\n\n6\nSection 5(g) of the 1944 Act, relied on as wholly excepting agricultural laborers from the restrictions of the 1917 Act, is set out below.5 It will be noted that this section does permit entrance of agricultural workers who, but for this Act, would not be admitted under the former law. The only exceptions from the long list of nonadmissibles under the 1917 and other Acts are these: illiterates and those who have been induced to come into the country by promises of employment, or whose passage has been paid by corporations or other persons. By specifically lifting the immigration barriers in these respects, Congress left the barriers in effect which barred physical and mental defectives, those with certain diseases, etc. And even the exceptions granted were not unconditional, for under the 1944 Act agricultural laborers could still be admitted only 'for such time and under such conditions * * * as may be required by regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization with the approval of the Attorney General * * *'.\n\n\n7\nIn pursuance of their authority under this Act the immigration authorities have promulgated regulations which provide in detail for the admission of agricultural laborers who are 'in all respects admissible under the immigration laws, except,' as to the particular limited provisions of the 1917 Act designated in the 1944 Act. Code Fed.Regs. \u00a7 115 (Cum.Supp.1943). And as shown by the Senate and House reports and hearings on the 1944 Act, a vast program was to be carried out to permit agricultural laborers to enter and to remain in the United States, but only for a limited time and under such conditions as conform with the immigration laws and regulations, and in accordance, so far as this case is concerned, with agreements made with the Government of Mexico.6 Far from abolishing the responsibilities of the immigration authorities in examining and approving these persons at the border and supervising their stay, the 1944 Act, the treaty and the regulations, although changing those responsibilities in some respects, have actually increased them. Aliens must still make a lawful entry at the places designated for their examination, screening, and registration. Those who do not meet the statutory standards of the 1917 Act, with the minor exceptions made in the 1944 Act, must be turned back. And those who are permitted to enter remain subject to supervision, control, and early deportation by immigration authorities.7\n\n\n8\nThis brings us to the contention that Hoy cannot be prosecuted under \u00a7 5 of the 1917 Act because the 1944 Act provides that \u00a7 5 'shall not apply to the importation of aliens under this title.' But Hoy was not charged with inducing or encouraging the Mexican aliens whom he wrote to come in 'under this title.'8 He was allegedly inviting them to enter the country in disregard and definance of 'this title' and all other law. Thus he was specifically charged with inducing aliens to come into this country who were not entitled to enter under the 1917 Act or 'under any other law of the United States as (he) then and there well knew.'  If this charge, as clarified by the bill of particulars, is true, he was urging aliens to come into this country without passing through the immigration stations, without regard to the length of their stay, or whether they were barred by reason of disease, physical weakness, or any of the other disqualifications set out in the 1917 and other laws or regulations.\n\n\n9\nThe 1944 Act was intended to permit alien agricultural workers to enter the country for a limited time under Government rules and regulations after proper proofs to Government officials that the aliens were so qualified. It is true that the law was intended to fill the need for agricultural workers by removing the 1917 prohibition against would-be employers' inviting and inducing foreign workers to come to the United States. But we are not persuaded that the law, which provided specific limitations and requisites to entry under it, can properly be interpreted to authorize would-be employers to invite, induce and offer rewards to aliens to circumvent immigration processing and to enter the United States in disregard and defiance of law. The 1917 prohibition against employers inducing laborers to enter the country, enforceable by sanctions, removed obstacles which might hinder immigration authorities in the performance of their duties; we do not think the 1944 Act was intended to license employers to obstruct their performance. The information charged an offense and it should not have been dismissed.\n\n\n10\nReversed.\n\n\n\n1\n Compare 39 Stat. 894, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 163, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 163 (crime to aid or assist any person to enter who believes in violent overthrow of government); 39 Stat. 880, 43 Stat. 166, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 145, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 145 (crime to bring to United States an alien with certain diseases); 45 Stat. 1551, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 180a, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 180a (crime for alien to enter at any place other than at an immigration point, or to elude examination).

For the purpose of performing this contract Rider\n\n\n4\n'caused supplies and materials (sand) to move in interstate      commerce between various points in the United States and the      site of his plant for the manufacture or mixing of ready      mixed concrete, and more particularly, from outside the State      of Pennsylvania into the State of Pennsylvania.'\n\n\n5\nThe indictment went on to charge that Stirone, using his influential union position,\n\n\n6\n'did * * * unlawfully obstruct, delay (and) affect interstate      commerce between the several states of the United States and the movement of the aforesaid materials      and supplies in such commerce, by extortion * * * of      $31,274.13 * * * induced by fear and by the wrongful use of      threats of labor disputes and threats of the loss of, and      obstruction and prevention of, performance of his contract to      supply ready mixed concrete.'\n\n\n7\nThe district judge, over petitioner's objection as to its materiality and relevancy, permitted the Government to offer evidence of an effect on interstate commerce not only in sand brought into Pennsylvania from other States but also in interference with steel shipments from the steel plant in Pennsylvania into Michigan and Kentucky. Again over petitioner's objection the trial judge charged the jury that so far as the interstate commerce aspect of the case was concerned, Stirone's guilt could be rested either on a finding that (1) sand used to make the concrete 'had been shipped from another state into Pennsylvania' or (2) 'Mr. Rider's concrete was used for constructing a mill which would manufacture articles of steel to be shipped in interstate commerce * * *' from Pennsylvania into other States. On motion of petitioner for arrest of judgment, acquittal or new trial, the District Court held that 'A sufficient foundation for introduction of both kinds of proof was laid in the indictment.' 168 F.Supp. 490, 495. The Court of Appeals affirmed, all the judges agreeing that interference with the sand movements into Pennsylvania was barred by the Hobbs Act. 3 Cir., 262 F.2d 571. Judge Hastie and Chief Judge Biggs disagreed with the court's holding that Stirone could be tried and convicted for interference with the possible future shipments of steel from Pennsylvania to Michigan and Kentucky. 262 F.2d 578, 580. They were of opinion that no interference with interstate steel shipments was charged in the indictment and that in any event it is an unreasonable extension of the Act to make a federal offense out of extortion from a man merely because he is supplying concrete to build a mill which after construction will produce steel, a part of which may, if processed, move in interstate commerce.\n\n\n8\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that Rider's dependence on shipments of sand from outside Pennsylvania to carry on his ready-mixed concrete business entitled him to the Hobbs Act's protection against interruption or stoppage of his commerce in sand by extortion of the kind that the jury found the petitioner had committed here. That Act speaks in broad language, manifesting a purpose to use all the constitutional power Congress has to punish interference with interstate commerce by extortion, robbery or physical violence. The Act outlaws such interference 'in any way or degree.' 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a), 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1951(a). Had Rider's business been hindred or destroyed, interstate movements of sand to him would have slackened or stopped. The trial jury was entitled to find that commerce was saved from such a blockage by Rider's compliance with Stirone's coercive and illegal demands. It was to free commerce from such destructive burdens that the Hobbs Act was passed. United States v. Green, 350 U.S. 415, 420, 76 S.Ct. 522, 525, 100 L.Ed. 494.\n\n\n9\nWhether prospective steel shipments from the new steel mills would be enough, alone, to bring this transaction under the Act is a more difficult question. We need not decide this, however, since we agree with the dissenting judges in the Court of Appeals that it was error to submit that question to the jury and that the error cannot be dismissed as merely an insignificant variance between allegation and proof and thus harmless error as in Berger v. United States, 295 U.S.78, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314. The crime charged here is a felony and the Fifth Amendment requires that prosecution be begun by indictment.\n\n\n10\nEver since Ex parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1, 7 S.Ct. 781, 30 L.Ed. 849, was decided in 1887, it has been the rule that after an indictment has been returned its charges may not be broadened through amendment except by the grand jury itself. In that case, the court ordered that some specific and relevant allegations the grand jury had charged be stricken from the indictment so that Bain might be convicted without proof of those particular allegations.2 In holding that this could not be done, Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for the Court, said:\n\n\n11\n'If it lies within the province of a court to change the      charging part of an indictment to suit its own notions of      what it ought to have been, or what the grand jury would      probably have made it if their attention had been called to      suggested changes, the great importance which the common law      attaches to an indictment by a grand jury, as a prerequisite      to a prisoner's trial for a crime, and without which the      constitution says 'no person shall be held to answer,' may be      frittered away until its value is almost destroyed.' 121 U.S.      1, 10, 7 S.Ct. 781, 786.\n\n\n12\nThe Court went on to hold in Bain: 'that after the indictment      was changed it was no longer the indictment of the grand jury      who presented it. Any other doctrine would place the rights      of the citizen, which were intended to be protected by the constitutional provision, at the mercy or control of      the court or prosecuting attorney * * *.' 121 U.S. 1, 13, 7      S.Ct. 781, 787.\n\n\n13\nThe Bain case, which has never been disapproved, stands for the rule that a court cannot permit a defendant to be tried on charges that are not made in the indictment against him. See also United States v. Norris, 281 U.S. 619, 622, 50 S.Ct. 424, 425, 74 L.Ed. 1076; Cf. Clyatt v. United States, 197 U.S. 207, 219, 220, 25 S.Ct. 429, 431, 432, 49 L.Ed. 726. Yet the court did permit that in this case. The indictment here cannot fairly be read as charging interference with movements of steel from Pennsylvania to other States nor does the Court of Appeals appear to have so read it. The grand jury which found this indictment was satisfied to charge that Stirone's conduct interfered with interstate importation of sand. But neither this nor any other court can know that the grand jury would have been willing to charge that Stirone's conduct would interfere with interstate exportation of steel from a mill later to be built with Rider's concrete. And it cannot be said with certainty that with a new basis for conviction added, Stirone was convicted solely on the charge made in the indictment the grand jury returned. Although the trial court did not permit a formal amendment of the indictment, the effect of what it did was the same. And the addition charging interference with steel exports here is neither trivial, useless, nor innocuous. Compare Ford v. United States, 273 U.S. 593, 602, 47 S.Ct. 531, 534, 71 L.Ed. 793; Goto v. Lane, 265 U.S. 393, 402, 44 S.Ct. 525, 527, 68 L.Ed. 1070. While there was a variance in the sense of a variation between pleading and proof, that variation here destroyed the defendant's substantial right to be tried only on charges presented in an indictment returned by a grand jury. Deprivation of such a basic right is far too serious to be treated as nothing more than a variance and then dismissed as harmless error. Compare Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314. The very purpose of the requirement that a man be indicted by grand jury is to limit his jeopardy to offenses charged by a group of his fellow citizens acting independently of either prosecuting attorney or judge.3 Thus the basic protection the grand jury was designed to afford is defeated by a device or method which subjects the defendant to prosecution for interference with interstate commerce which the grand jury did not charge.\n\n\n14\nHere, as the trial court charged the jury, there are two essential elements of a Hobbs Act crime: interference with commerce, and extortion. Both elements have to be charged. Neither is surplusage and neither can be treated as surplusage. The charge that interstate commerce is affected is critical since the Federal Government's jurisdiction of this crime rests only on that interference. It follows that when only one particular kind of commerce is charged to have been burdened a conviction must rest on that charge and not another, even though it be assumed that under an indictment drawn in general terms a conviction might rest upon a showing that commerce of one kind or another had been burdened. The right to have the grand jury make the charge on its own judgment is a substantial right which cannot be taken away with or without court amendment. Here, as in the Bain case, we cannot know whether the grand jury would have included in its indictment a charge that commerce in steel from a nonexistent steel mill had been interfered with. Yet because of the court's admission of evidence and under its charge this might have been the basis upon which the trial jury convicted petitioner. If so, he was convicted on a charge the grand jury never made against him. This was fatal error. Cf. Cole v. State of Arkansas, 333 U.S. 196, 68 S.Ct. 514, 92 L.Ed. 644; De Jonge v. State of Oregon, 299 U.S. 353, 57 S.Ct. 255, 81 L.Ed. 278.\n\n\n15\nReversed.\n\n\n\n1\n 62 Stat. 793, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1951.\n'(a) Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.\n'(b) As used in this section\u2014\n'(2) The term 'extortion' means the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.'\n\n\n2\n Bain was indicted for making a false statement 'with intent to deceive the Comptroller of the Currency and the agent appointed to examine the affairs of said association * * *.' After sustaining demurrers of Bain to the indictment, the trial court went on to say that 'thereupon, on motion of the United States, by counsel, the court orders that the indictment be amended by striking out the words 'the Comptroller of the Currency and' therein contained.' By this amendment it was intended to permit conviction of Bain without proof that he had deceived the Comptroller as the grand jury had charged.\n\n\n3\n 'Yet the institution (the grand jury) was adopted in this country, and is continued from considerations similar to those which give to it its chief value in England, and is designed as a means, not only of bringing to trial persons accused of public offenses upon just grounds, but also as a means of protecting the citizen against unfounded accusation, whether it comes from government, or be prompted by partisan passion or private enmity. No person shall be required, according to the fundamental law of the country, except in the cases mentioned, to answer for any of the higher crimes unless this body, consisting of not less than sixteen nor more than twenty-three good and lawful men, selected from the body of the district, shall declare, upon careful deliberation, under the solemnity of an oath, that there is good reason for his accusation and trial.'

Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662, it was held that retroactive welfare benefits awarded by a Federal District Court to the plaintiff class, by reason of wrongful denial of benefits by Illinois officials prior to the entry of the court's order determining the wrongfulness of their actions, violated the Eleventh Amendment, and that in an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 \"a federal court's remedial power, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, is necessarily limited to prospective injunctive relief  . . .  and may not include a retroactive award which requires the payment of funds from the state treasury.\"  Edelman, supra, at 677, 94 S.Ct., at 1362.  On remand, the District Court ordered the state officials to send to each member of the plaintiff class a notice informing him that he was denied public assistance to which he was entitled, together with a \"Notice of Appeal\" by which the recipient could request a hearing on the denial of benefits.  The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the proposed form of notice would have been barred by the Eleventh Amendment, but stated that on remand the District Court could order the state officials to send a \"mere explanatory notice to applicants advising them that there is a state administrative procedure available if they desire to have the state determine whether or not they may be eligible for past benefits,\" and that a returnable notice of appeal could also be provided.  Held:\n1. Neither Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611, the legislative history cited in that decision, nor this Court's Eleventh Amendment cases subsequent to Edelman cast any doubt on Edelman's holding that & 1983 does not abrogate the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the States.  Section 1983 does not explicitly and by clear language indicate on its face an intent to sweep away the immunity of the States;  nor does it have a history which focuses directly on the question of state liability or shows that Congress considered and firmly decided to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the States.  Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522, distinguished.  Nor does this Court's reaffirmance of Edelman in this case render \u00a7 1983 meaningless insofar as States are concerned.  Pp. 338-345. 2. The modified notice contemplated by the Court of Appeals constitutes permissible prospective relief and not a \"retroactive award which requires payment of funds from the state treasury.\" Such notice in effect simply informs plaintiff class members that there are existing administrative procedures by which they may receive a determination of eligibility for past benefits, that their federal suit is at an end, and that the federal court can provide them with no further relief.  Whether a recipient of the notice decides to take advantage of the available procedures is left completely to the discretion of that particular class member, the federal court playing no role in that decision.  And whether or not the class member will receive retroactive benefits rests entirely with the state, its agencies, courts, and legislature, not with the federal court.  Pp. 346-349.\n563 F.2d 873, affirmed.\nWilliam A. Wenzel, III, Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\nSheldon H. Roodman, Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n\n1\nREHNQUIST, Justice.\n\n\n2\nThis case is a sequel to Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), which we decided five Terms ago.  In Edelman we held that retroactive welfare benefits awarded by a Federal District Court to plaintiffs, by reason of wrongful denial of benefits by state officials prior to the entry of the court's order determining the wrongfulness of their actions, violated the Eleventh Amendment.1  The issue now before us is whether that same federal court may, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, order those state officials to send a mere explanatory notice to members of the plaintiff class advising them that there are state administrative procedures available by which they may receive a determination of whether they are entitled to past welfare benefits.  We granted certiorari to resolve an apparent conflict between the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in this case and that of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Fanty v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Dept. of Public Welfare, 551 F.2d 2 (CA3 1977).2  435 U.S. 904, 98 S.Ct. 1447, 55 L.Ed.2d 494 (1978).  We believe that the case as it now comes to us involves little, if any, unbroken ground in this area, and affirm the judgment of the Seventh Circuit.\n\n\n3\nFollowing our remand in Edelman, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, upon motion of the plaintiff, ordered the state officials to send to each member of the plaintiff class a notice informing the recipient: \"[Y]ou were denied public assistance to which you were entitled in the amount of $\u2014\u2014\u2014.\"  Jordan v. Trainor, 405 F.Supp. 802, 809 (1975).3  Enclosed with the required mailing was to be a \"Notice of Appeal,\" which when signed and returned to the Illinois Department of Public Aid, requested a hearing on the denial of benefits.  That notice stated:  \"The department illegally delayed in the processing of my AABD application, and, as a consequence, denied me benefits to which I was and am entitled.\"  Id., at 810.\n\n\n4\nThe Court of Appeals, en banc, found that this proposed form of notice would have been barred by the Eleventh Amendment, since it at least purported to decide that Illinois public funds should be used to satisfy the claims of plaintiff class members without the consent of the State by its appropriate officials.  Jordan v. Trainor, 563 F.2d 873, 875 (1977).4  The court reversed the District Court's order for this reason, but stated that on remand the District Court could order the state officials to send a \"mere explanatory notice to applicants advising them that there is a state administrative procedure available if they desire to have the state determine whether or not they may be eligible for past benefits.  A simple returnable notice of appeal form could also be provided.\"  Ibid.  In the court's view, such a notice would not violate the distinction set forth in Edelman between prospective relief, which is permitted by the Eleventh Amendment, and retrospective relief, which is not:\n\n\n5\n\"The form of notice we envisage would not create a      'liability' against the state.  Whether a liability might      result would be a matter for state determination, not the      federal court.  No federal judgment against the state would      be created.  Such a notice could not be labeled equitable      restitution or be considered an award of damages against the      state.  The defendant makes no issue out of any incidental      administrative expense connected with the preparation or      mailing of the notice.  It has suggested in the record that      the notice could be included in the regular monthly mailing.      The necessary information comes from a computer.  There is no      indication that the administrative expense would be      substantial.\"  563 F.2d, at 876.\n\n\n6\nUnder the contemplated modified notice procedure, the court stated, members of the plaintiff class would be given no more than \"they would have gathered by sitting in the courtroom or by reading and listening to news accounts had the case attracted any attention.\"  Id., at 877-878.5  Three judges dissented on the ground that the majority's revised notice form was barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n\n7\nIn Edelman we reaffirmed the rule that had evolved in our earlier cases that a suit in federal court by private parties seeking to impose a liability which must be paid from public funds in the state treasury is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  415 U.S., at 663, 94 S.Ct., at 1355;  see Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Comm'n, 327 U.S. 573 (1946);  Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, 323 U.S. 459, 65 S.Ct. 347, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945);  Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U.S. 47, 64 S.Ct. 873, 88 L.Ed. 1121 (1944).  We rejected the notion that simply because the lower court's grant of retroactive benefits had been styled \"equitable restitution\" it was permissible under the Eleventh Amendment.  But we also pointed out that under the landmark decision in Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), a federal court, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, may enjoin state officials to conform their future conduct to the requirements of federal law, even though such an injunction may have an ancillary effect on the state treasury. 415 U.S., at 667-668, 94 S.Ct., at 1357-1358;  see Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 289, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 2761, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977);  Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 237, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1686, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974).  The distinction between that relief permissible under the doctrine of Ex parte Young and that found barred in Edelman was the difference between prospective relief on one hand and retrospective relief on the other.6\n\n\n8\nPetitioner state official devotes a significant part of his brief to an attack on the proposed notice which the District Court required the state officials to send.  It is, however, the decision of the Court of Appeals, and not that of the District Court, which we review at the behest of the petitioner.  And just as petitioner insists on tilting at windmills by attacking the District Court's decision, respondent suggests that our decision in Edelman has been eviscerated by later decisions such as Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).  Brief for Respondent 55 n. 37.  See also Aldridge v. Turlington, No. TCA-78-830 (N.D.Fla., Nov. 17, 1978);  but see Skehan v. Board of Trustees of Bloomsburg State College, 590 F.2d 470 (CA3 1978).  As we have noted above, we held in Edelman that in \"a [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1983 action  . . .  a federal court's remedial power, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, is necessarily limited to prospective injunctive relief, Ex parte Young, supra, and may not include a retroactive award which requires the payment of funds from the state treasury, Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, supra.\"  415 U.S., at 677, 94 S.Ct., at 1362.  We disagree with respondent's suggestion.  This Court's holding in Monell was \"limited to local government units which are not considered part of the State for Eleventh Amendment purposes,\" 436 U.S., at 690 n. 54, 98 S.Ct., at 2035 and our Eleventh Amendment decisions subsequent to Edelman and to Monell have cast no doubt on our holding in Edelman.  See Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U.S. 781, 98 S.Ct. 3057, 57 L.Ed.2d 1114 (1978); Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978);  Milliken v. Bradley, supra;  Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 96 S.Ct. 2666, 49 L.Ed.2d 614 (1976);  Scheuer v. Rhodes, supra.7\n\n\n9\nWhile the separate opinions in Hutto v. Finney, supra,8 debated the continuing soundness of Edelman after our decision in Monell, any doubt on that score was largely dispelled by Alabama v. Pugh, supra, decided just 10 days after Hutto.  In Pugh the Court held, over three dissents, that the State of Alabama could not be joined as a defendant without violating the Eleventh Amendment, even though the complaint was based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the claim was a violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments similar to that made in Hutto.  The Court said:\n\n\n10\n\"There can be no doubt, however, that suit against the      State and its Board of Corrections is barred by the Eleventh      Amendment, unless Alabama has consented to the filing of such      a suit.  Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39      L.Ed.2d 662 (1974);  Ford Motor Co. v. Department of      Treasury, 323 U.S. 459, 65 S.Ct. 347, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945);      Worcester County Trust Co. v. Riley, 302 U.S. 292, 58 S.Ct.      185, 82 L.Ed. 268 (1937).\"  438 U.S., at 782, 98 S.Ct., at      3058.9\n\n\n11\nThe decision in Pugh was consistent both with Monell, which was limited to \"local government units,\" 436 U.S., at 690 n. 54, 98 S.Ct., at 2035 n. 54, and with Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, supra. In the latter case we found the \" 'threshold fact of congressional authorization,' \" which had been lacking in Edelman, to be present in the express language of the congressional amendment making Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applicable to state and local governments.  427 U.S., at 452, 96 S.Ct., at 2669, quoting Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S., at 672, 94 S.Ct., at 1360.\n\n\n12\nMr. Justice BRENNAN in his opinion concurring in the judgment argues that our holding in Edelman that \u00a7 1983 does not abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity is \"most likely incorrect.\"  Post, at 354.  To reach this conclusion he relies on \"assum[ptions]\" drawn from the Fourteenth Amendment, post, at 355, on \"occasional remarks\" found in a legislative history that contains little debate on \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, the precursor to \u00a7 1983, post, at 358 n. 15,10 on the reference to \"bodies politic\" in the Act of Feb. 25, 1871, 16 Stat. 431, the \"Dictionary Act,\" post, at 355-35711 and, finally on the general language of \u00a7 1983 itself, post, at 356.  But, unlike our Brother BRENNAN, we simply are unwilling to believe, on the basis of such slender \"evidence,\" that Congress intended by the general language of \u00a7 1983 to override the traditional sovereign immunity of the States.  We therefore conclude that neither the reasoning of Monell or of our Eleventh Amendment cases subsequent to Edelman, nor the additional legislative history or arguments set forth in Mr. Justice BRENNAN's concurring opinion, justify a conclusion different from that which we reached in Edelman.12\n\n\n13\nThere is no question that both the supporters and opponents of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 believed that the Act ceded to the Federal Government many important powers that previously had been considered to be within the exclusive province of the individual States.13  Many of the remarks from the legislative history of the Act quoted in Mr. Justice BRENNAN's opinion amply demonstrate this point.  Post, at 359-365.  See also Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 173-176, 81 S.Ct. 473, 476-478, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961).  But neither logic, the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, nor the legislative history of the 1871 Act compels, or even warrants, a leap from this proposition to the conclusion that Congress intended by the general language of the Act to overturn the constitutionally guaranteed immunity of the several States.14  In Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. 367, 71 S.Ct. 783, 95 L.Ed. 1019 (1951), the Court rejected a similar attempt to interpret the word \"person\" in \u00a7 1983 as a withdrawal of the historic immunity of state legislators.  The Court's words bear repeating here:\n\n\n14\n\"Did Congress by the general language of its 1871      statute mean to overturn the tradition of legislative freedom      achieved in England by Civil War and carefully preserved in      the formation of State and National Governments here?  Did it      mean to subject legislators to civil liability for acts done      within the sphere of legislative activity?  . . .  The limits      of \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the 1871 statute\u2014now \u00a7\u00a7 43 and 47(3) of      Title 8\u2014were not spelled out in debate.  We cannot believe      that Congress\u2014itself a staunch advocate of legislative      freedom\u2014would impinge on a tradition so well grounded in      history and reason by covert inclusion in the general      language before us.\"  341 U.S., at 376, 71 S.Ct., at 788.\n\n\n15\nGiven the importance of the States' traditional sovereign immunity, if in fact the Members of the 42d Congress believed that \u00a7 1 of the 1871 Act overrode that immunity, surely there would have been lengthy debate on this point and it would have been paraded out by the opponents of the Act along with the other evils that they thought would result from the Act.  Instead, \u00a7 1 passed with only limited debate and not one Member of Congress mentioned the Eleventh Amendment or the direct financial consequences to the States of enacting \u00a7 1.  We can only conclude that this silence on the matter is itself a significant indication of the legislative intent of \u00a7 1.\n\n\n16\nOur cases consistently have required a clearer showing of congressional purpose to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity than our Brother BRENNAN is able to marshal.  In Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U.S. 279, 93 S.Ct. 1614, 36 L.Ed.2d 251 (1973), the Court concluded that Congress did not lift the sovereign immunity of the States by enacting the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-219, because of the absence of any indication \"by clear language that the constitutional immunity was swept away.  It is not easy to infer that Congress in legislating pursuant to the Commerce Clause, which has grown to vast proportions in its applications, desired silently to deprive the States of an immunity they have long enjoyed under another part of the Constitution.\"  411 U.S., at 285, 93 S.Ct., at 1618.15  In Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, the Court found present in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq., the \"threshold fact of congressional authorization\" to sue the State as employer, because the statute made explicit reference to the availability of a private action against state and local governments in the event the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the Attorney General failed to bring suit or effect a conciliation agreement.  427 U.S., at 448 n. 1, 449 n. 2, 452, 96 S.Ct., at 2667 n. 1, 2668 n. 2, 2669; see Equal Opportunity Employment Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 105, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1);  H.R.Rep.No.92-238, pp. 17-19 (1971); S.Rep.No.92-415, pp. 9-11 (1971);  S.Conf.Rep.No.92-681, pp. 17-18 (1972);  H.R.Conf.Rep.No.92-899, pp. 17-18 (1972), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1972, p. 2137.  Finally, in Hutto v. Finney, decided just last Term, the Court held that in enacting the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, Congress intended to override the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the States and authorize fee awards payable by the States when their officials are sued in their official capacities.  437 U.S., at 693-694, 98 S.Ct., at 2575-2576.  Although the statutory language in Hutto did not separately impose liability on States in so many words,16 the statute had \"a history focusing directly on the question of state liability; Congress considered and firmly rejected the suggestion that States should be immune from fee awards.\"  Id., at 698 n. 31, 98 S.Ct., at 2578 n. 31.  Also, the Court noted that the statute would have been rendered meaningless with respect to States if the Act did not impose liability for attorney's fees on the States.  Ibid.; see Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., supra, 411 U.S., at 285-286, 93 S.Ct., at 1618-1619.  By contrast, \u00a7 1983 does not explicitly and by clear language indicate on its face an intent to sweep away the immunity of the States;  nor does it have a history which focuses directly on the question of state liability and which shows that Congress considered and firmly decided to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the States.  Nor does our reaffirmance of Edelman render \u00a7 1983 meaningless insofar as States are concerned.  See Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908).17\n\n\n17\nWe turn, then, to the question which has caused disagreement between the Courts of Appeals:  does the modified notice contemplated by the Seventh Circuit constitute permissible prospective relief or a \"retroactive award which requires the payment of funds from the state treasury\"?  We think this relief falls on the Ex parte Young side of the Eleventh Amendment line rather than on the Edelman side.18  Petitioner makes no issue of the incidental administrative expense connected with preparing and mailing the notice.19  Instead, he argues that giving the proposed notice will lead inexorably to the payment of state funds for retroactive benefits and therefore it, in effect, amounts to a monetary award.  But the chain of causation which petitioner seeks to establish is by no means unbroken;  it contains numerous missing links, which can be supplied, if at all, only by the State and members of the plaintiff class and not by a federal court. The notice approved by the Court of Appeals simply apprises plaintiff class members of the existence of whatever administrative procedures may already be available under state law by which they may receive a determination of eligibility for past benefits.  The notice of appeal, we are told, is virtually identical to the notice sent by the Department of Public Aid in every case of a denial or reduction of benefits.  The mere sending of that notice does not trigger the state administrative machinery.  Whether a recipient of notice decides to take advantage of those available state procedures is left completely to the discretion of that particular class member;  the federal court plays no role in that decision.  And whether or not the class member will receive retroactive benefits rests entirely with the State, its agencies, courts, and legislature, not with the federal court.20\n\n\n18\nThe notice approved by the Court of Appeals, unlike that ordered by the District Court, is more properly viewed as ancillary to the prospective relief already ordered by the court. See Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S., at 290, 97 S.Ct., at 2762.  The notice in effect simply informs class members that their federal suit is at an end, that the federal court can provide them with no further relief, and that there are existing state administrative procedures which they may wish to pursue.  Petitioner raises no objection to the expense of preparing or sending it.  The class members are \"given no more  . . .  than what they would have gathered by sitting in the courtroom.\"  Jordan v. Trainor, 563 F.2d, at 877-878.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore\n\n\n19\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n20\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL joins as to Parts I, II, and III, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n21\nFor the reasons set forth in my dissent in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 687, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1367, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), I concur in the judgment of the Court.1\n\n\n22\n* It is deeply disturbing, however, that the Court should engage in today's gratuitous departure from customary judicial practice and reach out to decide an issue unnecessary to its holding.  The Court today correctly rules that the explanatory notice approved by the Court of Appeals below is \"properly viewed as ancillary to  . . .  prospective relief.\"  Ante, at 349.  This is sufficient to sustain the Court's holding that such notice is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  But the Court goes on to conclude, in what is patently dicta, that a State is not a \"person\" for purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Rev.Stat. \u00a7 1979.2\n\n\n23\nThis conclusion is significant because, only three Terms ago, Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445, 96 S.Ct. 2666, 49 L.Ed.2d 614 (1976), held that \"Congress may, in determining what is 'appropriate legislation' for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, provide for private suits against States or state officials which are constitutionally impermissible in other contexts.\"  Id., at 456, 96 S.Ct., at 2671. If a State were a \"person\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983, therefore, its immunity under the Eleventh Amendment would be abrogated by the statute.3 Edelman v. Jordan, supra, had held that \u00a7 1983 did not override state immunity, for the reason, as the Court later stated in Fitzpatrick, that \"[t]he Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, had been held in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 187-191, 81 S.Ct. 473, 484, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), to exclude cities and other municipal corporations from its ambit;  that being the case, it could not have been intended to include States as parties defendant.\"  427 U.S., at 452, 96 S.Ct., at 2669.4  The premise of this reasoning was undercut last Term, however, when Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), upon re-examination of the legislative history of \u00a7 1983, held that a municipality was indeed a \"person\" for purposes of that statute.5  As I stated in my concurrence in Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 703, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2581, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978), Monell made it \"surely at least an open question whether \u00a7 1983 properly construed does not make the States liable for relief of all kinds, notwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment.\"\n\n\n24\nThe Court's dicta today would close that open question on the basis of Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U.S. 781, 98 S.Ct. 3057, 57 L.Ed.2d 1114 (1978).  In that case the State of Alabama had been named as a party defendant in a suit alleging unconstitutional conditions of confinement.  The question presented was \"[w]hether the mandatory injunction issued against the State of Alabama and the Alabama Board of Corrections violates the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity or exceeds the jurisdiction granted federal courts by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\"  Id., at 782-783, n. 2, 98 S.Ct., at 3058.  The Court held that the State should not have been named as a party defendant.\n\n\n25\nPugh, however, does not stand for the proposition that a State is not a \"person\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983.  Not only does the Court's opinion in that case fail even to mention \u00a7 1983, it frames the issue addressed as whether Alabama had \"consented to the filing of such a suit.\"  438 U.S., at 782, 98 S.Ct., at 3058. Since Alabama's consent would have been irrelevant if Congress had intended States to be encompassed within the reach of \u00a7 1983, the Court apparently decided the first half of the question presented \"[w]hether the mandatory injunction issued against the State of Alabama  . . .  violates the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity\" without considering or deciding the second half\u2014whether the mandatory injunction \"exceeds the jurisdiction granted federal courts by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\"6\n\n\n26\nThis parsing of Pugh is strengthened by a consideration of the circumstances surrounding that decision.  Pugh a short per curiam, was issued on the last day of the Term without the assistance of briefs on the merits or argument.  Alabama's petition for certiorari and respondents' brief in opposition were filed on February 6, 1978, and April 6, 1978, respectively, months before Monell was announced.  They were thus necessarily without the benefit of Monell's major re-evaluation of the legislative history of \u00a7 1983.7  Respondents did not even raise the possibility that Alabama might be a \"person\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983.8  Since the issue is not, as the Court now phrases it, whether the Members of this Court were then aware ofMonell, ante, at 340 n. 9, but rather whether they had before them briefs and arguments detailing the implications of Monell for the question of whether a State is a \"person\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983, it is not anomalous that the Court's opinion in Pugh failed to address or consider this issue.\n\n\n27\nThe Court's reliance on Pugh is particularly significant because the question whether a State is a \"person\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983 is neither briefed nor argued by the parties in the instant case.  Indeed, petitioner states flatly that \"the en banc decision of the Seventh Circuit does not rest upon a conclusion that the term 'person' for purposes of \u00a7 1983 includes sovereign states, as opposed to state officials, within its ambit.  That issue is not the issue before this Court on Petitioner's Writ for Certiorari.\" Reply Brief for Petitioner 14.  Respondent concurs, stating that \"it is unnecessary in this case to confront directly the far-reaching question of whether Congress intended in \u00a7 1983 to provide for relief directly against States, as it did against municipalities.\"  Brief for Respondent 55 n. 37.\n\n\n28\nThus, the Court today decides a question of major significance without ever having had the assistance of a considered presentation of the issue, either in briefs or in arguments.  The result is pure judicial fiat.\n\nII\n\n29\nThis fiat is particularly disturbing because it is most likely incorrect.  Section 1983 was originally enacted as \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871.  The Act was enacted for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.9  That Amendment exemplifies the \"vast transformation\" worked on the structure of federalism in this Nation by the Civil War.  Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225, 242, 92 S.Ct. 2151, 2162, 32 L.Ed.2d 705 (1972). The prohibitions of that Amendment \"are directed to the States  . . ..  They have reference to actions of the political body denominated a State, by whatever instruments or in whatever modes that action may be taken.\"  Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 346-347, 25 L.Ed. 676 (1880).10  The fifth section of the Amendment provides Congress with the power to enforce these prohibitions \"by appropriate legislation.\"  \"Congress, by virtue of the fifth section  . . ., may enforce the prohibitions whenever they are disregarded by either the Legislative, the Executive, or the Judicial Department of the State.  The mode of enforcement is left to its discretion.\"   Virginia v. Rives, 100 U.S. 313, 318, 25 L.Ed. 667 (1880).\n\n\n30\nThe prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment and Congress' power of enforcement are thus directed at the States themselves, not merely at state officers.  It is logical to assume, therefore, that \u00a7 1983, in effectuating the provisions of the Amendment by \"interpos[ing] the federal courts between the States and the people, as guardians of the people's federal rights,\" Mitchum v. Foster, supra, 407 U.S., at 242, 92 S.Ct., at 2162, is also addressed to the States themselves.  Certainly Congress made this intent plain enough on the face of the statute.\n\n\n31\nSection 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 created a federal cause of action against \"any person\" who, \"under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State,\" deprived another of \"any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States.\"  On February 25, 1871, less than two months before the enactment of the Civil Rights Act, Congress provided that \"in all acts hereafter passed  . . .  the word 'person' may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate  . . .  unless the context shows that such words were intended to be used in a more limited sense.\"11  \u00a7 2, 16 Stat. 431.  Monell, held that \"[s]ince there is nothing in the 'context' of the Civil Rights Act calling for a restricted interpretation of the word 'person,' the language of that section should prima facie be construed to include 'bodies politic' among the entities that could be sued.\"  436 U.S., at 689-690 n. 53, 98 S.Ct., at 2035.  Even the Court's opinion today does not dispute the fact that in 1871 the phrase \"bodies politic and corporate\" would certainly have referred to the States.12  See Heim v. McCall, 239 U.S. 175, 188, 36 S.Ct. 78, 82, 60 L.Ed. 206 (1915);  McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U.S. 1, 24, 13 S.Ct. 3, 6, 36 L.Ed. 869 (1892);  Poin- dexter v. Greenhow, 114 U.S. 270, 288, 5 S.Ct. 903, 912, 29 L.Ed. 185 (1885);  Cotton v. United States, 11 How. 229, 231, 13 L.Ed. 675 (1851);  Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, 447, 1 L.Ed. 440 (Iredell, J.), 468 (Cushing, J.) (1793);  Utah State Building Comm'n v. Great American Indemnity Co., 105 Utah 11, 16, 140 P.2d 763, 766 (1943);  Board of Comm'rs of Hamilton County v. Noyes, 3 Am.L.Rec. 745, 748 (Super.Ct.Cincinnati 1874);  1 J. Wilson, Works 305 (1804);  cf. Keith v. Clark, 97 U.S. 454, 460-461, 24 L.Ed. 1071 (1877);  Munn v. Illinois, 94 U.S. 113, 124, 24 L.Ed. 77 (1877);  Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, 76-77, 18 L.Ed. 721 (1868);  Butler v. Pennsylvania, 10 How. 402, 416-417, 13 L.Ed. 472 (1851);  Penhallow v. Doane's Administrators, 3 Dall. 54, 92-93, 1 L.Ed. 507 (1795) (Iredell, J.);  Mass. Const., Preamble. Indeed, during the very debates surrounding the enactment of the Civil Rights Act, States were referred to as bodies politic and corporate.  See, e. g., Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 661-662 (1871) (hereinafter Globe) (Sen. Vickers) (\"What is a State?  Is it not a body politic and corporate?\");  cf. id., at 696 (Sen. Edmunds).  Thus the expressed intent of Congress, manifested virtually simultaneously with the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, was that the States themselves, as bodies corporate and politic, should be embraced by the term \"person\" in \u00a7 1 of that Act.\n\n\n32\nThe legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 reinforces this conclusion.  The Act was originally reported to the House as H.R. 320 by Representative Shellabarger.  At that time Representative Shellabarger stated that the bill was meant to be remedial \"in aid of the preservation of human liberty and human rights,\" and thus to be \"liberally and beneficently construed.\"13 Globe App. 68.  The bill was meant to give \"[f]ull force and effect  . . .  to section five\" of the Fourteenth Amendment, Globe 322 (Rep. Stoughton),14 see id., at 800 (Rep. Perry);  Monell, 436 U.S., at 685 n. 45, 98 S.Ct., at 2033 n. 45, and therefore, like the prohibitions of that Amendment, to be addressed against the States themselves.15  See, e. g., Globe 481-482 (Rep. Wilson);  696 (Sen. Edmunds).16  It was, as Representative Kerr who opposed the bill instantly recognized, \"against the rights of the States of this Union.\" Globe App. 46.  Representative Shellabarger, in introducing the bill, made this explicit, stressing the need for \"necessary affirmative legislation to enforce the personal rights which the Constitution guaranties, as between persons in the State and the State itself.\"  Id., at 70.  See, e. g., id., at 80 (Rep. Perry); Globe 375 (Rep. Lowe);  481-482 (Rep. Wilson);  568 (Sen. Edmunds).  Representative Bingham elaborated the point:\n\n\n33\n\"The powers of the States have been limited and the      powers of Congress extended by the last three amendments of      the Constitution.  These last amendments\u2014thirteen, fourteen,      and fifteen\u2014do, in my judgment, vest in Congress a power to      protect the rights of citizens against States, and      individuals in States, never before granted.\n\n\n34\n*          *          *          *          *\n\n\n35\n\"Why not in advance provide against the denial of rights      by States, whether the denial be acts of omission or      commission, as well as against the unlawful acts of      combinations and conspiracies against the rights of the      people?\n\n\n36\n\"The States never had the right, though they had the      power, to inflict wrongs upon free citizens by a denial of the full protection of the laws;  because all State officials      are by the Constitution required to be bound by oath or      affirmation to support the Constitution.  As I have already      said, the States did deny to citizens the equal protection of      the laws, they did deny the rights of citizens under the      Constitution, and except to the extent of the express      limitations upon the States, as I have shown, the citizen had      no remedy.  . . .  They took property without compensation,      and he had no remedy.  They restricted the freedom of the      press, and he had no remedy.  They restricted the freedom of      speech, and he had no remedy.  They restricted the rights of      conscience, and he had no remedy.  They bought and sold men      who had no remedy.  Who dare say, now that the Constitution      has been amended, that the nation cannot by law provide      against all such abuses and denials of right as these in      States and by States, or combination of persons?\"  Globe App.      83, 85 (emphasis added).17\n\n\n37\nH.R. 320 was necessary, as Senator Edmunds stated, to protect citizens \"in the rights that the Constitution gave them  . . .  against any assault by any State or under any State or through the neglect of any State  . . .,\" Globe 697, and by a \"State,\" Edmunds meant \"a corporation  . . .  an organized thing . . .  manifested, represented entirely, and fully in respect to every one of its functions, by that department of its government on which the execution of those functions is respectively devolved.\"  Id., at 696.  See id., at 607-608 (Sen. Pool).\n\n\n38\nIt was common ground, therefore, that, as Representative Wilson argued, the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment were directed against the State, meaning \"the government of the State . . .  the legislative, the judicial, and the executive\";  that the fifth section of the Amendment had given Congress the power to enforce it by \"appropriate legislation,\" meaning \"legislation adequate to meet the difficulties to be encountered to suppress the wrongs existing, to furnish remedies and inflict penalties adequate to the suppression of all infractions of the rights of the citizens\";  and that H.R. 320 was such legislation.  Globe 481-483.  Those who opposed the bill were fully aware of the major implications of such a statute.  Representative Blair, for example, rested his opposition on the fact that the bill, including \u00a7 1, was aimed at the States in their \"corporate and legislative capacity\":\n\n\n39\n\"The inhibitions in the [Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and      Fifteenth] amendments against the United States and the      States are against them in their corporate and legislative      capacities, for the thing or acts prohibited can alone be      performed by them in their corporate or legislative      capacities.\n\n\n40\n*          *          *          *          *\n\n\n41\n\"As the States have the power to violate them and not      individuals, we must presume that the legislation provided      for is against the States in their corporate and legislative      capacity or character and those acting under their laws, and      not against the individuals, as such, of the States.  I am sustained in this view of the case by the tenth      section of the first article of the Constitution of the      United States.  In it are a number of inhibitions against the      States, which it is evident are against them in their      corporate and legislative capacity;  and to which I      respectfully call the attention of the gentlemen who favor      this bill.\"  Globe App. 208.18\n\n\n42\nSee id., at 209.  This conclusion produced an anguished outcry from those committed to unrevised notions of state sovereignty.  Representative Arthur, for example, complained that \u00a7 1\n\n\n43\n\"reaches out and draws within the despotic circle of      central power all the domestic, internal, and local      institutions and offices of the States, and then asserts over      them an arbitrary and paramount control as of the rights,      privileges, and immunities secured and protected, in a      peculiar sense, by the United States in the citizens thereof.      Having done this, having swallowed up the States and their      institutions, tribunals, and functions, it leaves them the      shadow of what they once were.\"  Globe 365.\n\n\n44\nThe answer to such arguments was, of course, that the Civil War had irrevocably and profoundly altered the balance of power between Federal and State Governments:\n\n\n45\n\"If any one thinks it is going too far to give the      United States this national supervisory power to protect the      fundamental rights of citizens of the United States, I do not      agree with him.  It is not wise to permit our devotion to the      reserved rights of the States to be carried so far as to      deprive the citizen of his privileges and immunities.\n\n\n46\n\"We must remember that it was State rights, perverted I      admit from their true significance, that arrayed themselves against the nation and threatened its existence.  We      must remember that it was for the very purpose of placing in      the General Government a check upon this arrogance of some of      the States that the fourteenth amendment was adopted by the      people.  We must remember that, if the legislation we propose      does trench upon what have been, before the fourteenth      amendment, considered the rights of the States, it is in      behalf and for the protection of immunities and privileges      clearly given by the Constitution;  and that Federal laws and      Federal rights must be protected whether domestic laws or      their administration are interfered with or not, because the      Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof are the      supreme law of the land.  We are not making a constitution,      we are enacting a law, and its virtue can be tested without      peril by the experiment.\"  Id., at 502 (Sen. Frelinghuysen).\n\n\n47\nIn the reconstructed union, national rights would be guaranteed federal protection even from the States themselves.\n\nIII\n\n48\nThe plain words of \u00a7 1983, its legislative history and historical context, all evidence that Congress intended States to be embraced within its remedial cause of action.  The Court today pronounces its conclusion in dicta by avoiding such evidence.  It chooses to hear, in the eloquent and pointed legislative history of \u00a7 1983, only \"silence.\"  Such silence is in fact deafening to those who have ears to listen.  But without reason to reach the question, without briefs, without argument, relying on a precedent that was equally ill-informed and in any event not controlling, the Court resolutely opines that a State is not a \"person\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983.  The 42d Congress, of course, can no longer pronounce its meaning with unavoidable clarity.  Fitzpatrick, however, cedes to the present Congress the power to rectify this erroneous misinterpretation.  It need only make its intention plain.\n\n\n49\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n50\nI concur in the judgment of the Court, for the reasons expressed in my dissenting opinion in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 688, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1368, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), and my concurring opinion in Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U.S. 279, 287, 93 S.Ct. 1614, 1619, 36 L.Ed.2d 251 (1973). Moreover, I agree that an affirmance here follows logically from the Court's decision in Edelman, because the explanatory notice approved by the Court of Appeals clearly is ancillary to prospective relief.  But given that basis for deciding the present case, it is entirely unnecessary for the Court to address the question whether a State is a \"person\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1983.  Accordingly, I join Parts I, II, and III of my Brother BRENNAN's opinion.\n\n\n\n1\n The history of this case is set forth in greater detail in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).\n\n\n2\n In Fanty, the plaintiff class alleged that the manner in which the defendant state officials had collected class members' federal benefits in reimbursement of amounts granted under state welfare laws violated this Court's decision in Philpott v. Essex County Welfare Board, 409 U.S. 413, 93 S.Ct. 590, 34 L.Ed.2d 608 (1973).  The District Court agreed, and while it denied retroactive relief against the State on the basis of Edelman v. Jordan, supra, it did require the defendant state officials to notify plaintiff class members that under Philpott they have no legal obligation to make reimbursement out of their federal disability benefits and that as a matter of state law they may have a cause of action against the Department of Public Welfare for refund of prior payments.  The Court of Appeals, in three separate opinions, reversed.  Chief Judge Seitz was of the opinion that the notice relief was barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Judge Garth, concurring in the result, believed that the Eleventh Amendment issue was \"borderline,\" 551 F.2d, at 6, but voted to reverse on the basis that there was no case or controversy.  Judge Hunter dissented on grounds not relevant here.  However, he disagreed with Chief Judge Seitz that the Eleventh Amendment prohibited the notice relief.\n\n\n3\n Because this was a class action qualifying under Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23(b)(2), the class members had never received notice of the complaint, the original lower court judgment, this Court's decision or its effect on them.  See Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177 n. 14, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 2152 n. 14, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974);  Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23(e).  Under Rule 23(d)(2), however, a court may require appropriate notice \"for the protection of the members of the class or otherwise for the fair conduct of the action.\"\nPrior to ordering notice, the District Court requested the parties to submit information with respect to the number of persons in the plaintiff class, the cost of notifying them, the amounts involved, and other issues affecting the equities of sending notice.  Respondent filed his response to the court's request but the state officials submitted no response.  Respondent indicated that there were approximately 20,000 to 33,500 members in the plaintiff class.  App. 34a.  The cost of identifying class members was stated to be simply the cost of running the department's computer for a period necessary to cull out the names of the plaintiff class members.  Respondent claimed that there would be no additional cost of notifying class members because the notice could be included in one of the regular mailings to the members of the plaintiff class.  Petitioner has not disputed respondent's allegations either below or before this Court.\n\n\n4\n A panel of the Seventh Circuit originally had reversed the District Court's order requiring notice on the ground that the Eleventh Amendment was a \"jurisdictional bar to the exercise of federal judicial power concerning past action or inaction of a state with respect to the Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled Program.\"  Jordan v. Trainor, 551 F.2d 152, 155 (1977).\n\n\n5\n In reaching its decision, the Seventh Circuit relied in part on our summary affirmance of Grubb v. Sterrett, 315 F.Supp. 990 (N.D.Ind.), aff'd, 400 U.S. 922, 91 S.Ct. 187, 27 L.Ed.2d 182 (1970), in which the District Court had ordered Indiana public assistance officials to send to plaintiff class members a notice similar to the one at issue here.  As the Court of Appeals recognized, the list of summary affirmances overruled in Edelman was not necessarily intended to be exhaustive.  See Jordan v. Trainor, 563 F.2d, at 876.  However, we prefer to rest our affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case on our conclusion that it is consistent with Edelman.\n\n\n6\n As we stated in Edelman:\n\"[T]hat portion of the District Court's decree which petitioner challenges on Eleventh Amendment grounds goes much further than [Ex parte Young and the cases that had followed it]. It requires payment of state funds, not as a necessary consequence of compliance in the future with a substantive federal-question determination, but as a form of compensation to those whose applications were processed on the slower time schedule at a time when petitioner was under no court-imposed obligation to conform to a different standard.  . . .  It will to a virtual certainty be paid from state funds, and not from the pockets of the individual state officials who were the defendants in the action.  It is measured in terms of a monetary loss resulting from a past breach of a legal duty on the part of the defendant state officials.\" 415 U.S., at 668, 94 S.Ct., at 1358.\n\n\n7\n Mr. Justice BRENNAN's opinion concurring in the judgment states that \"Edelman v. Jordan, supra, had held that \u00a7 1983 did not override state immunity, for the reason, as the Court later stated in Fitzpatrick, that '[t]he Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, had been held in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 187-191, 81 S.Ct. 473, 484, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), to exclude cities and other municipal corporations from its ambit;  that being the case, it could not have been intended to include States as parties defendant.' \"  Post, at 351.  Since Monell overruled Monroe's holding that cities and other municipal corporations are not \"persons\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1983, Mr. Justice BRENNAN's opinion argues that the \"premise\" of Edelman has been \"undercut.\" Post, at 351.  The fallacy of this line of reasoning was aptly demonstrated last Term by Mr. Justice POWELL in his concurring opinion in Hutto, where he stated:  \"The language in question from Fitzpatrick was not essential to the Court's holding in that case. Moreover, this position ignores the fact that Edelman rests squarely on the Eleventh Amendment immunity, without adverting in terms to the treatment of the legislative history in Monroe v. Pape  . . . .\"  437 U.S., at 708-709, n. 6, 98 S.Ct., at 2583-2584, n. 6.  In fact, Monroe v. Pape is not even cited in Edelman.\n\n\n8\n In Hutto v. Finney, there were three separate opinions in addition to that of the Court.  Two opinions expressed the view that the Court had misapplied the rule laid down in Edelman.  437 U.S., at 704, 98 S.Ct., at 2581 (POWELL, J., concurring and dissenting);  id., at 710, 98 S.Ct., at 2584 (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting).  Mr. Justice BRENNAN, though joining the opinion of the Court, wrote separately to suggest that the Court's opinions in Monell, and Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, had rendered \"the essential premise of our Edelman holding  . . .  no longer true.\"  437 U.S., at 703, 98 S.Ct., at 2580.  The Court itself in Hutto, however, recognized and applied Edelman's distinction between retrospective and prospective relief.\n\n\n9\n Our Brother BRENNAN in his opinion concurring in the judgment curiously suggests that the language quoted from Pugh in the text could not mean what it, on its face, says, because the briefs in the case were filed before our decision in Monell was announced.  Post, at 352-354.  But while the parties in Pugh were \"without the benefit of Monell \u00a7 major re-evaluation of the legislative history of \u00a7 1983,\" post, at 352-353, the Members of this Court labored under no similar disability.  The decision in Pugh was handed down nearly one month after Monell and 10 days after Hutto, where separate opinions debated this precise point. If, after Monell and Hutto, this Court harbored any doubts about the continued validity of Edelman \u00a7 conclusion that \u00a7 1983 does not constitute a waiver of the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the States, it is inconceivable that the Court would have taken the extraordinary action of summarily reversing a lower court on the basis of Edelman.\n\n\n10\n There was only limited debate on \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, and it passed without amendment.  Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S., at 665, 98 S.Ct., at 2023.  The sections that drew most of the debate were those that created certain federal crimes, permitted the President to send the militia to any State with widespread Ku Klux Klan violence, and authorized suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in certain circumstances.  Id., at 665 n. 11, 98 S.Ct., at 2023 n. 11.\n\n\n11\n The Dictionary Act was intended to provide a \"few general rules for the construction of statutes.\"  Cong.Globe, 41st Cong., 3d Sess., 1474 (1871) (remarks of Rep. Poland).  While it was enacted two months before the enactment of the 1871 Civil Rights Act, it came more than five years after passage of \u00a7 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, which served as the model for the language of \u00a7 1 of the 1871 Act.  Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 68 (1871) (remarks of Rep. Shellabarger);  see Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 183-185, 81 S.Ct. 473, 481-483, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961);  post, at 362 n. 17.\n\n\n12\n Mr. Justice BRENNAN's opinion characterizes this conclusion as \"gratuitous\" and \"paten[t] dicta.\"  Post, at 350. But we cannot think of a more \"gratuitous\" or useless exercise of this Court's discretionary jurisdiction than to decide which of two conflicting interpretations of Edelman v. Jordan is correct, if in truth we believed that Edelman itself no longer were valid. The question does not arise out of the blue;  it was extensively discussed in our brother BRENNAN's concurrence in Hutto v. Finney last Term.  We therefore fail to see how our reaffirmance of Edelman can be characterized as \"dicta.\"\n\n\n13\n For example, the Act was attacked as an attempt to strip States of the power to punish and proscribe offenses within their borders, e. g., Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 396 (1871) (remarks of Rep. Rice);  id., at App. 112 (remarks of Rep. Moore); id., at App. 117 (remarks of Sen. Blair), and of their authority to decide when the militia of the United States should be called into their territory to quell domestic disturbances, e. g., id., at 647 (remarks of Sen. Davis);  id., at App. 139 (remarks of Rep. McCormick).\n\n\n14\n Indeed the Prigg-Dennison-Day line of cases, relied on so heavily in Monell would surely militate against such a conclusion. 436 U.S., at 672-683, 98 S.Ct., at 2027-2032;  see Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. (41 U.S.) 539, 10 L.Ed. 1060 (1842); Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. (65 U.S.) 66, 16 L.Ed. 717 (1861); Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. (78 U.S.) 113, 20 L.Ed. 122 (1871). Our Brother BRENNAN's concurrence in the judgment today relies on Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 25 L.Ed. 676 (1880), and on Virginia v. Rives, 100 U.S. 313, 25 L.Ed. 667 (1880).  But these cases were decided nearly a decade after the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, and as noted in Monell substantially undercut the Prigg-Dennison-Day line of cases for purposes of enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment.  436 U.S., at 676, 98 S.Ct., at 2028.  But (as was noted in Monell ), it was the Prigg-Dennison-Day line of cases that was \"the reigning constitutional theory of [the] day\" when the Civil Rights Act of 1871 was debated and enacted.  436 U.S., at 676, 98 S.Ct., at 2028.\n\n\n15\n The Court in Employees \"found not a word in the history of the [statute] to indicate a purpose of Congress to make it possible for a citizen of that State or another State to sue the State in the federal courts.\"  411 U.S., at 285, 93 S.Ct., at 1618.  The Court also added that its interpretation of the law did not render the statute's inclusion of state institutions meaningless.  Id., at 285-286, 93 S.Ct., at 1618-1619.\n\n\n16\n While Hutto, unlike Fitzpatrick and Employees, did not require an express statutory waiver of the State's immunity, 437 U.S., at 695, 698 n. 31, 98 S.Ct., at 2576, 2578 n. 31, the Court was careful to emphasize that it was concerned only with expenses incurred in litigation seeking prospective relief while the other cases involved retroactive liability for prelitigation conduct. Id., at 695, 98 S.Ct., at 2576.  The Court also noted that it was not concerned with a statute that imposed \" 'enormous fiscal burdens on the States' \" and that if it were, it might require a formal indication of Congress' intent to abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity, as did Employees and Fitzpatrick. 437 U.S., at 697 n. 27, 98 S.Ct., at 2027 n. 27.  Extending \u00a7 1983 liability to States obviously would place \"enormous fiscal burdens on the States.\"  But we need not reach the question whether an express waiver is required because neither the language of the statute nor the legislative history discloses an intent to overturn the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity by imposing liability directly upon them.\n\n\n17\n The arguments in Mr. Justice BRENNAN's opinion regarding Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat.  (22 U.S.) 738, 6 L.Ed. 204 (1824), are similarly unpersuasive.  Post, at 359-361, n. 16.  Mr. Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in Osborn makes it clear that in determining whether a court can grant relief the key inquiry is whether the state officer was in fact the real party in interest or whether he was only a nominal party.  9 Wheat., at 858.  See also Bank of United States v. Planters' Bank of Georgia, 9 Wheat. 904, 907, 6 L.Ed. 244 (1824).  Mr. Chief Justice Marshall emphasized this precise point just four years later in his opinion for the Court in Governor of Georgia v. Madrazo, 1 Pet. 110, 7 L.Ed. 73 (1828).  In Mandrazo, a vessel carrying slaves was seized and the\nslaves were delivered into the possession of the Governor of Georgia.  The slaves were sold and the proceeds were placed in the state treasury.  Mandrazo filed a libel in the Federal District Court, naming the Governor of Georgia, among others, as a defendant.  Restitution was ordered by the lower courts, but this Court reversed because although the demand for relief nominally was against the Governor of the State, it was clear that the action in fact sought relief directly from the state treasury, relief that was forbidden by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\"The claim upon the governor, is as a governor;  he is sued, not by his name, but by his title.  The demand made upon him, is not made personally, but officially.\n\"The decree is pronounced not against the person, but the officer, and appeared to have been pronounced against the successor of the original defendant;  as the appealed bond was executed by a different governor from him who filed the information.  In such a case, where the chief magistrate of a state is sued, not by his name, but by his style of office, and the claim made upon him is entirely in his official character, we think the state itself may be considered as a party on the record. If the state is not a party, there is no party against whom a decree can be made.  No person in his natural capacity is brought before the Court as defendant.  This not being a proceeding against the thing, but against the person, a person capable of appearing as a defendant, against whom a decree can be pronounced, must be a party to the cause before a decree can be regularly pronounced.\"  Id., at 123-124 (emphasis added).\nTo similar effect see Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How., at 97-98, which reaffirmed these principles of Mandrazo and which, as the Court in Monell emphasized, was \"well known to Members of Congress\" at the time of the passage of the 1871 Act.  436 U.S., at 679, 98 S.Ct., at 2568.  To the extent that Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203, 24 L.Ed. 447 (1873), which did no more than affirm an injunctive decree against a state official, is inconsistent with the rule applied in Edelman, it suffices to say that it was repudiated long before the latter decision.  In Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, 323 U.S. 459, 65 S.Ct. 347, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945), the Court stated:\n\"[W]hen the action is in essence one for the recovery of money from the state, the state is the real, substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its sovereign immunity from suit even though individual officials are nominal defendants.\" Id., at 464, 65 S.Ct., at 350.\n\n\n18\n In addition to petitioner's Eleventh Amendment arguments, he contends that the Court of Appeals' notice violates the law of the case as established in Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).  We disagree.  The doctrine of law of the case comes into play only with respect to issues previously determined.  In re Sanford Fork & Tool Co., 160 U.S. 247, 16 S.Ct. 291, 40 L.Ed. 414 (1895).  On remand, the \"Circuit Court may consider and decide any matters left open by the mandate of this court.\"  Id., at 256, 16 S.Ct., at 293.  Accord, Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, 254 U.S. 175, 41 S.Ct. 93, 65 L.Ed. 205 (1920).  The Court in Edelman considered the constitutionality only of the relief before it.  415 U.S., at 665, 94 S.Ct., at 1356.  It was not presented with the question of the propriety of notice relief.  Petitioner also claims that the District Court lacked power to order notice under the terms of this Court's remand.  The simple answer to this contention is that we remanded the matter in Edelman \"for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,\" and we hold today that the award of notice relief, as fashioned by the Court of Appeals, is not inconsistent with either the spirit or express terms of our decision in Edelman. \"While a mandate is controlling as to matters within its compass, on the remand a lower court is free as to other issues.\"  Sprague v. Ticonic National Bank, 307 U.S. 161, 168, 59 S.Ct. 777, 781, 83 L.Ed. 1184 (1939), citing In re Sanford Fork & Tool Co., supra.\n\n\n19\n It appears from respondent's answers to a District Court request that any expense associated with the preparation and mailing of the notice would be de minimis.  See n. 3, supra.\n\n\n20\n As of January 1, 1974, the Aid to the Aged, Blind, and Disabled program was replaced by a completely federal-funded Supplemental Security Income program.  Pub.L. 92-603, Title III, \u00a7 301, 86 Stat. 1465.  Petitioner argues that the notice relief is impermissible because if retroactive benefits ultimately are awarded to the plaintiff class members, there is little likelihood that the Federal Government will reimburse the State for assistance payments made relating to a now defunct program.  Thus, Illinois would have to bear the total cost of such retroactive payments.  This fact may well be relevant to the state agency's or court's determination of whether to award retroactive benefits. But since the notice relief does not constitute a money judgment, it is not at all relevant to the question of the propriety of the notice fashioned by the Court of Appeals.\nPetitioner also states that even if the Department of Public Aid determines to grant retroactive relief, it may not request the Comptroller to draw, or the Treasurer to make payments from, funds appropriated for a current fiscal year for an outstanding obligation incurred during a prior fiscal year without the express authorization from the legislature.  See Reply Brief for State Petitioner 5.  Thus, as a result of the lapse of Public Aid appropriations for fiscal years 1968, 1969, 1970, and 1971, petitioner claims that members of the plaintiff class would be required to resort to filing claims against the State in the Illinois Court of Claims.  These facts may influence a plaintiff class member in deciding whether to pursue existing state remedies or the legislature in determining whether to give its approval to a payment of retroactive benefits, but they do not affect our conclusion that the notice relief awarded here is permissible under the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n\n1\n In Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S., at 687-688, 94 S.Ct., at 1367-1368, I stated:\n\"This suit is brought by Illinois citizens against Illinois officials.  In that circumstance, Illinois may not invoke the Eleventh Amendment, since that Amendment bars only federal court suits against States by citizens of other States.  Rather, the question is whether Illinois may avail itself of the nonconstitutional but ancient doctrine of sovereign immunity as a bar to respondent's claim for retroactive AABD payments.  In my view Illinois may not assert sovereign immunity for the reason I expressed in dissent in Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U.S. 279, 298, 93 S.Ct. 1614, 1625, 36 L.Ed.2d 251 (1973): the States surrendered that immunity in Hamilton's words, 'in the plan of the Convention,' that formed the Union, at least insofar as the States granted Congress specifically enumerated powers. See id., at 319 n. 7, 93 S.Ct., at 1635 n. 7;  Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U.S. 184, 84 S.Ct. 1207, 12 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964). Congressional authority to enact the Social Security Act, of which AABD is a part, former 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-1385 (now replaced by similar provisions in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-804 (1970 ed., Supp.II), is to be found in Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1, one of the enumerated powers granted Congress by the States in the Constitution.  I remain of the opinion that 'because of its surrender, no immunity exists that can be the subject of a congressional declaration or a voluntary waiver,' 411 U.S., at 300, 93 S.Ct., at 1626, and thus have no occasion to inquire whether or not Congress authorized an action for AABD retroactive benefits, or whether or not Illinois voluntarily waived the immunity by its continued participation in the program against the background of precedents which sustained judgments ordering retroactive payments.\"\n\n\n2\n Section 1983 states:\n\"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\"\n\n\n3\n There is no question but that \u00a7 1983 was enacted by Congress under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Section 1983 was originally the first section of an Act entitled \"An Act to enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States  . . . .\"  17 Stat. 13.\n\n\n4\n This reasoning had been employed by several lower courts which had considered this question.  See, e. g., United States ex rel. Gittlemacker v. County of Philadelphia, 413 F.2d 84, 86 n. 2 (CA3 1969) (\"In view of the Supreme Court's holding in Monroe v. Pape  . . .  that a municipal corporation is not a 'person' subject to suit within the meaning of the Civil Rights Act, the conclusion that states are not persons within the meaning of the Act is inescapable\");  Williford v. California, 352 F.2d 474, 476 (CA9 1965).\n\n\n5\n For a discussion of the implications of Monell for this question, see Aldridge v. Turlington, Civ. Act. No. TCA-78-830 (ND Fla., Nov. 17, 1978).\n\n\n6\n This is what I take to be the significance of the observation of my Brother STEVENS in Pugh :\n\"Surely the Court does not intend to resolve summarily the issue debated by my Brothers in their separate opinions in Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 700 [98 S.Ct. 2565, 2579, 57 L.Ed.2d 522] (BRENNAN, J., concurring), and 708-709 n. 6 [98 S.Ct. 2583 n. 6] (POWELL, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\"  438 U.S., at 783 n. * [98 S.Ct., at 3058 n. *] (1978) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).  Cf. The Supreme Court, 1977 Term, 92 Harv.L.Rev. 57, 325-326 (1978).\n\n\n7\n Indeed, the entire discussion of the issue in the petition for certiorari is as follows:\n\"The grant of an injunction against the State and the Board of Corrections in an action based upon 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 is in direct conflict with decisions of other courts of appeal which hold that neither a State nor a State agency is a 'person' within the meaning of the statute and amenable to suit under it. Meredith v. Arizona, 523 F.2d 481 (9th Cir. 1975);  Curtis v. Everette, 489 F.2d 516 (3rd Cir. 1973).  The decisions below conflict, at least in principle, with this Court's holding in City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U.S. 507, 93 S.Ct. 2222, 37 L.Ed.2d 109 (1973), that municipalities are not 'persons' under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\"  Pet. for Cert. in Alabama v. Pugh, O.T. 1977, No. 77-1107, pp. 11-12.\n\n\n8\n The discussion of the issue by the respondents in Pugh was unilluminating:\n\"Supreme Court Rule 19(1) states that certiorari will only be 'granted where there are special and important reasons therefor.'  The second issue raised by the Petitioners challenges the injunction against the State of Alabama and the Alabama Board of Corrections alleging:  (1) each is immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment;  (2) neither is a 'person' subject to 42 U.S.C. 1983 jurisdiction;  and (3) Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 [94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662] (1974) and Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 [28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714] (1908) bar judgments against the State for prospective costs of compliance with an order. Under the facts of these cases, the questions presented are not only unimportant but are essentially irrelevant.\n\"First, additional defendants enjoined include all members of the Alabama Board of Corrections and numerous other prison officials who would clearly remain bound by the injunction issued, Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232 [94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90] (1974);  Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 [94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662] (1974) and have the authority in their official capacity to carry out the court's orders.  Second, the State of Alabama and the Board of Corrections were only named defendants in the Pugh case and not the James case.  Therefore, any action taken on this issue in Pugh would not affect the same relief granted in James.  Third, this issue was never thought important enough by counsel for the petitioners to raise, brief or argue in the trial court.  Fourth, the Court of Appeals did not see fit to speak to this issue at all.  Fifth, whether the State of Alabama and\/or the Board of Corrections are enjoined in addition to the members of the Board of Corrections has absolutely no practical effect on what has happened or will happen under the court's order.\"  Brief in Opposition in Alabama v. Pugh, O.T. 1977, No. 77-1107, pp. 9-10.\n\n\n9\n See n. 3, supra.\n\n\n10\n \"We have said the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment are addressed to the States.  They are, 'No State shall make or enforce a law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States,  . . .  nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.' \"  100 U.S., at 346.\n\"It is these which Congress is empowered to enforce, and to enforce against State action, however put forth, whether that action be executive, legislative, or judicial.  Such enforcement is no invasion of State sovereignty.  No law can be, which the people of the States have, by the Constitution of the United States, empowered Congress to enact.\"  Ibid.\n\n\n11\n Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), held that the word \"may\" in the Act was to be interpreted as the equivalent of \"shall\":  \"Such a mandatory use of the extended meanings of the words defined by the Act is  . . .  required for it to perform its intended function\u2014to be a guide to 'rules of construction' of Acts of Congress.

See Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U.S. 391, 399-400, and n. 17, 99 S.Ct. 1171, 1176-1177, and n. 17, 59 L.Ed.2d 401 (1979).  Senator Thurman of Ohio, who opposed the Act, stated with respect to \u00a7 1 that \"there is no limitation whatsoever upon the terms that are employed, and they are as comprehensive as can be used.\"  Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 217 (1871) (hereinafter Globe App.) (emphasis added).\n\n\n14\n One of the reasons given by the Court in Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978), for not requiring an \"express statutory waiver of the State's immunity,\" ante, at 344 n. 16, before applying to the States the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, was that the Act had been \"enacted to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.\"  437 U.S., at 698 n. 31, 98 S.Ct., at 2578.\n\n\n15\n It was common ground, at least after the Fourteenth Amendment, that Congress could \"dea[l] with States and with citizens.\"  Globe 777 (Sen. Frelinghuysen).  See id., at 793 (Rep. Poland).  Representative Willard of Vermont, for example, who voted for H.R. 320, opposed the Sherman amendment, which would have held a municipal corporation liable for damages to its inhabitants by private persons \" 'riotously and tumultuously assembled,' \" Monell, supra, at 664, 98 S.Ct., at 2022, on the grounds that the Fourteenth Amendment imposed liability directly on the States and not on such municipal corporations:\n\"I hold that this duty of protection, if it rests anywhere, rests on the State, and that if there is to be any liability visited upon anybody for a failure to perform that duty, such liability should be brought home to the State.  Hence, in my judgment, this section would be liable to very much less objection, both in regard to its justice and its constitutionality, if it provided that if in any State the offenses named in this section were committed, suit might be brought against the State, judgment obtained, and payment of the judgment might be enforced upon the treasury of the State.\"  Globe 791.\nSee id., at 756-757 (Sen. Edmunds).\nThere was general agreement, however, that just as Congress could not impose affirmative obligations on municipalities, Monell, supra, at 681 n. 40, 98 S.Ct., at 2031, n. 40, so it could not \"command a State officer to do any duty whatever, as such.\"  Globe 795 (Rep. Blair).  See id., at 799 (Rep. Farnsworth);  Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113 (1871);  Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 16 L.Ed. 717 (1861);  Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 539, 10 L.Ed. 1060 (1842).  Contrary to the suggestion of the Court, ante, at 341 n. 14, however, the Prigg-Dennison-Day line of cases, which stands for the principle that \"the Federal Government  . . .  has no power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever,\" 24 How., at 107, no more \"militate[s] against\" the conclusion that States are \"persons\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983, than it militates against the conclusion that municipalities are such persons.  Everyone agreed, after all, that state officers, as such, would be subject to liability for violations of \u00a7 1983.  The doctrine of coordinate sovereignty, relied on in the Prigg-Dennison-Day line of cases, would not have distinguished between such liability and the liability of the State itself.  See Monell, 436 U.S., at 682, 98 S.Ct., at 2031.\n\n\n16\n A view of the reach of \u00a7 1 suggested by occasional remarks in the legislative history of H.R. 320 to the effect that \"[t]he Government can act only upon individuals,\" Globe App. 251 (Sen. Morton), was rejected last Term when Monell held that municipalities were \"persons\" for purposes of \u00a7 1983.  It was a view colored by the belief that, since a \"State always acts through instrumentalities,\" Globe 334 (Rep. Hoar), State violations of the Fourteenth Amendment could most effectively be reached through imposing liability on the state officials through whom States acted.  As Representative Burchard stated:\n\"In the enforcement of the observance of duties imposed directly upon the people by the Constitution, the General Government applies the law directly to persons and individual acts.  It may punish individuals for interference with its prerogatives and infractions of the rights it is authorized to protect.  For the neglect or refusal of a State to perform a constitutional duty, the remedies and power of enforcement given to the General Government are few and restricted.  It cannot perform the duty the Constitution enjoins upon the State.  If a State fails to appoint presidential electors, or its Legislature to choose Senators, or its people to elect Representatives, Congress cannot act for them.  Nor do prohibitions upon States authorize Congress to exercise the forbidden power.  It may doubtless require State officers to discharge duties imposed upon them as such officers by the Constitution of the United States.  A State office must be assumed with such limitations and burdens, such duties and obligations, as the Constitution of the United States attaches to it.  The General Government cannot punish the State, but the officer who violates his official constitutional duty can be punished under Federal law.  What more appropriate legislation for enforcing a constitutional prohibition upon a State than to compel State officers to observe it?  Its violation by the\nState can only be consummated through the officers by whom it acts.\"  Globe App. 314.\nIt is noteworthy that, even under this view, \u00a7 1983 would abrogate the Eleventh Amendment immunity of States to the extent necessary to provide full relief for any plaintiff suing a state officer.  Cf. Globe 365-366 (Rep. Arthur);  385 (Rep. Lewis); Globe App. 217 (Sen. Thurman).  Thus, even if this limited approach had emerged out of concern for the Eleventh Amendment immunity of States, the distinction \"between prospective relief on one hand and retrospective relief on the other,\" ante, at 337, which was drawn by Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), would be eliminated by the congressional enactment of \u00a7 1983.  This is not anomalous, however, since the 42d Congress would have had no way to anticipate Edelman's distinction, and would much more probably have had in mind the decision of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 6 L.Ed. 204 (1824), which held:\n\"It may, we think, be laid down as a rule which admits of no exception, that, in all cases where jurisdiction depends on the party, it is the party named in the record.  Consequently, the 11th amendment, which restrains the jurisdiction granted by the constitution over suits against States, is, of necessity, limited to those suits in which a State is a party on the record.  The amendment has its full effect, if the constitution be construed as it would have been construed, had the jurisdiction of the Court never been extended to suits brought against a State, by the citizens of another State, or by aliens.\n\"The State not being a party on the record, and the Court having jurisdiction over those who are parties on the record, the true question is, not one of jurisdiction, but whether, in the exercise of its jurisdiction, the Court ought to make a decree against the defendants;  whether they are to be considered as having a real interest, or as being only nominal parties.\"  Id., at 857-858.\nFour years later the Court, again per Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, stated that a suit against the office, as opposed to the person, of the Governor of a State had the effect of making the State a party of record, Governor of Georgia v. Madrazo, 1 Pet. 110, 7 L.Ed. 73 (1828), but the essential principle remained unaltered, as evidenced by Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203, 21 L.Ed. 447 (1873), a case decided two years after the Civil Rights Act of 1871:\n\"In deciding who are parties to the suit the court will not look beyond\nthe record.  Making a State officer a party does not make the State a party, although her law may have prompted his action, and the State may stand behind him as the real party in interest.  A State can be made a party only by shaping the bill expressly with that view, as where individuals or corporations are intended to be put in that relation to the case.\"  Id., at 220.\nFor the legislators of the 42d Congress, therefore, an action under \u00a7 1983 directed at state officers, regardless of the effect of the suit on the State itself, would preserve the Eleventh Amendment immunity of States, so long as States themselves were not named parties.  To the extent subsequent decisions of this Court have introduced an Eleventh Amendment bar to such suits when \"the action is in essence one for the recovery of money from the state,\" Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, 323 U.S. 459, 464, 65 S.Ct. 347, 350, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945), this bar would be eliminated by the congressional enactment of \u00a7 1983.  Since in the instant case neither the State of Illinois nor the office of the Governor of Illinois are parties \"on the record,\" even a limited reading of the reach of \u00a7 1983 should therefore hold the Eleventh Amendment inapplicable.\n\n\n17\n Section 1 of H.R. 320 was modeled after \u00a7 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, which imposed criminal penalties on \"any person\" who, \"under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom,\" deprived \"any inhabitant of any State or Territory\" of \"any right secured  . . .  by this act.\"  As Representative Shellabarger stated:  \"That section [\u00a7 2] provides a criminal proceeding in identically the same case as this one [\u00a7 1] provides a civil remedy  . . ..\"  Globe App. 68. Representative Bingham noted the limited application of the remedy provided by \u00a7 2:\n\"It is clear that if Congress do so provide by penal laws for the protection of these rights [guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment], those violating them must answer for the crime, and not the States.  The United States punishes men, not States, for a violation of its law.\"  Globe App. 85-86.\nRepresentative Bingham was thus able to distinguish, as apparently the Court is not, ante, at 341 n. 11, between the reach of the word \"person\" in \u00a7 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, and its reach in \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871.\n\n\n18\n Representative Blair reached this conclusion after reasoning that if the bill were interpreted as applicable only to individuals, it would not be able to fulfill the purposes of the Reconstruction Amendments.\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"446 U.S. 398\n100 S.Ct. 1747\n64 L.Ed.2d 381\nMichael M. BUSIC, Petitioner,v.UNITED STATES.  Anthony LaROCCA, Jr., Petitioner,  v.  UNITED STATES.\nNos. 78-6020, 78-6029.\nArgued Feb. 27, 1980.\nDecided May 19, 1980.\n\n\nSyllabus\n*\n\nUpon their joint trial in Federal District Court, petitioners were convicted of, inter alia, armed assault on federal officers petitioner LaRocca as the actual triggerman and petitioner Busic as an aider and abettor and thus derivatively a principal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\u2014in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111, which makes it unlawful to assault a federal officer and which provides for enhanced punishment when the assaulter \"uses\" a deadly weapon.  In addition, LaRocca was convicted of using, and Busic of carrying, a firearm in the commission of the armed assault, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), which authorizes the imposition of enhanced penalties on a defendant who \"uses\" (\u00a7 924(c)(1)) or \"carries\" (\u00a7 924(c)(2)) a firearm while committing a federal felony.  Each petitioner's sentence included 5 years on possession of firearms and the assault charges, and 20 years for the \u00a7 924(c) violations. The Court of Appeals ultimately held that, while LaRocca's sentence could not be enhanced under both \u00a7 111 and \u00a7 924(c)(1) for \"using\" a firearm, he could be sentenced under either at the Government's election, but that, since the \u00a7 924(c) charge against Busic alleged not that he \"used\" a firearm but rather that he \"carried\" one, his sentence was valid.\nHeld :  Section 924(c) may not be applied to a defendant who uses a firearm in the course of a felony that is proscribed by a statute which itself authorizes enhancement if a dangerous weapon is used.  The sentence received by such a defendant may be enhanced only under the enhancement provision in the statute defining the felony he committed.  Pp. 403-411.\n(a) This result is supported not only by Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70, but also by the legislative history of \u00a7 924(c) and the canons of statutory construction that ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity, and that a more specific statute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 here) will be given precedence over a more general one (\u00a7 924(c)), even if, as here, the general provision was enacted later.  To the extent that this construction may lead to irrational sentencing patterns in which some less severe crimes are punished more than other more severe crimes, it is the Congress, not this Court, that must take corrective action.  Pp. 403-410.\n(b) This holding not only makes it clear that petitioner LaRocca may not be sentenced under \u00a7 924(c)(1) for using his gun to assault federal officers, but also applies to petitioner Busic's case.  Nor can Busic's sentence be sustained by arguing that a person who carries a gun in the commission of a \u00a7 111 violation may be sentenced under \u00a7 924(c)(2) because the enhancement provision of \u00a7 111 does not apply to those who carry but do not use their weapons.  The fact is that Busic is being punished for using a weapon.  Through the combination of \u00a7 111 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, he was found guilty as a principal of using a firearm to assault federal agents.  Pp. 410-411.\n3rd Cir., 587 F.2d 577, reversed and remanded.\nGerald Goldman, Washington, D. C., for Michael M. Busic.\nSamuel J. Reich, Pittsburgh, Pa., for LaRocca.\nMark I. Levy, Washington, D. C., for United States.\nMr. Justice BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nTitle 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) authorizes the imposition of enhanced penalties on a defendant who uses or carries a firearm while committing a federal felony.  The question for decision in these cases is whether that section may be applied to a defendant who uses a firearm in the course of a felony that is proscribed by a statute which itself authorizes enhancement if a dangerous weapon is used.  We hold that the sentence received by such a defendant may be enhanced only under the enhancement provision in the statute defining the felony he committed and that \u00a7 924(c) does not apply in such a case.\n\n\n2\n* Petitioners Anthony LaRocca, Jr., and Michael Busic were tried together on a multicount indictment charging drug, firearms, and assault offenses flowing from a narcotics conspiracy and an attempt to rob an undercover agent.  The evidence showed that in May 1976 the two arranged a drug buy with an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration who was to supply $30,000 in cash. When the agent arrived with the money, LaRocca attempted to rob him at gunpoint.  The agent signalled for reinforcements, and as other officers began to close in LaRocca fired several shots at them.  No one was hit and the agents succeeded in disarming and arresting LaRocca.  Busic was also arrested and the officers seized a gun he was carrying in his belt but had not drawn. Additional weapons were found in the pair's automobile.1\n\n\n3\nA jury in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania convicted petitioners of narcotics and possession-of-firearms counts,2 and of two counts of armed assault on federal officers in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111\u2014LaRocca as the actual triggerman and Busic as an aider and abettor, and thus derivatively a principal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.  In addition, LaRocca was convicted of using a firearm in the commission of a federal felony in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1), and Busic was convicted of carrying a firearm in the commission of a federal felony in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2).3  Each petitioner was sentenced to a total of 30 years, of which 5 resulted from concurrent sentences on the narcotics charges, 5 were a product of concurrent terms on the firearms and assault charges, and 20 were imposed for the \u00a7 924(c) violations.\n\n\n4\nThe defendants appealed, contending, among other things, that they could not be sentenced consecutively for assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114 and for the use of a firearm in connection with that crime as provided in \u00a7 924(c).5  In an opinion announced before Simpson v.United States, 435 U.S. 6, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978), was decided, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit concluded that the imposition in LaRocca's case of enhanced sentences under both \u00a7 924(c) and \u00a7 111 for a single assault with a firearm violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment because the two statutes required proof of identical elements.  587 F.2d 577, 583-584 (1978).  Accordingly, LaRocca's case was remanded to the District Court for resentencing under either \u00a7 111 or \u00a7 924(c), at the Government's election. Since the \u00a7 924(c) charge against Busic alleged not that he used a firearm (\u00a7 924(c)(1)), but rather that hecarried one (\u00a7 924(c)(2)), the Court of Appeals held that no like infirmity invalidated his conviction and sentence.  In its view, the \u00a7 111 and \u00a7 924(c) charges against him did not require proof of the same elements and hence did not merge because the former could be established merely by showing that Busic had aided and abetted LaRocca's use of a gun to assault the federal officers, while the latter required proof of the additional fact that Busic had unlawfully carried a gun.  587 F.2d, at 584.\n\n\n5\nFollowing this Court's decision in Simpson v. United States, supra, the Court of Appeals granted a petition for rehearing and vacated its double jeopardy holding with regard to LaRocca on grounds there was no reason to reach the constitutional question. 587 F.2d, at 587-589.  Thereafter, it proceeded as a matter of statutory construction to arrive at a nearly identical conclusion namely, that LaRocca's sentence could not be enhanced under both \u00a7 111 and \u00a7 924(c) but that he could be sentenced under either at the Government's election.  The Court of Appeals did not alter its holding with regard to Busic. We granted certiorari, 442 U.S. 916, 99 S.Ct. 2835, 61 L.Ed.2d 282 (1979), and now reverse the enhanced sentences that were imposed on both petitioners under \u00a7 924(c).\n\nII\n\n6\nWe turn first to the case of petitioner LaRocca because it poses most directly the key question of legislative intent.  Our starting point, like that of the parties, is Simpson, supra. There we considered the relationship between \u00a7 924(c) and the federal bank robbery statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113, which, like the assault provision at issue here, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111, predates \u00a7 924(c) and provides by its own terms for enhanced punishment where the felony is committed with a dangerous weapon.6  Relying upon the legislative history and applicable canons of statutory construction, Simpson held that the Congress cannot be understood to have intended that a defendant who has been convicted of robbing a bank with a firearm may be sentenced under both \u00a7 924(c) and \u00a7 2113(d).  The parties to the instant cases agree that Simpson clearly prohibits the imposition on these petitioners of similarly enhanced sentences under both \u00a7 924(c) and \u00a7 111.  But the Government contends that Simpson resolved only the double enhancement question\u2014that the Court's holding and opinion should not be read to find \u00a7 924(c) inapplicable where the prosecution proceeds under that provision rather than the enhancement provision of a predicate felony statute like \u00a7 111.  Such a reading, the Government asserts, is supported by the facts presented in Simpson,7 the language used to describe the actual \"holding,\"8 the most likely inferences that may be drawn as to what Congress would have wanted had it focussed on the precise problem,9 and the asserted irrationality of some of the consequences that would flow from a holding that \u00a7 924(c) is inapplicable in cases like the present cases.10\n\n\n7\nWe disagree.  In our view, Simpson's language and reasoning support one conclusion alone\u2014that prosecution and enhanced sentencing under \u00a7 924(c) is simply not permissible where the predicate felony statute contains its own enhancement provision. This result is supported not only by the general principles underlying the doctrine of stare decisis \u2014principles particularly apposite in cases of statutory construction\u2014but also by the legislative history and relevant canons of statutory construction. The Government has not persuaded us that this result is irrational or depends upon implausible inferences as to congressional intent. And to the extent that cases can be hypothesized in which this holding may support curious or seemingly unreasonable comparative sentences, it suffices to say that the asserted unreasonableness flows not from Simpson and this decision, but rather from the statutes as Congress wrote them.  If corrective action is needed, it is the the Congress that must provide it.  \"It is not for us to speculate, much less act, on whether Congress would have altered its stance had the specific events of this case been anticipated.\" TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 185, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 2297, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978).\n\n\n8\nOur reasoning has several strands.  It begins, as indeed it must, with the text and legislative history of \u00a7 924(c).  By its terms, that provision tells us nothing about the way Congress intended to mesh the new enhancement scheme with analogous provisions in pre-existing statutes defining federal crimes. Moreover, as Simpson noted, 435 U.S., at 13, 98 S.Ct., at 913, and n. 7, \u00a7 924(c) was offered as an amendment on the House floor by Representative Poff, 114 Cong.Rec. 22231 (1968), and passed on the same day.  Id., at 22248.  Accordingly, the committee reports and congressional hearings to which we normally turn for aid in these situations simply do not exist, and we are forced in consequence to search for clues to congressional intent in the sparse pages of floor debate that make up the relevant legislative history.  The crucial material for present purposes is the following observation by Representative Poff:\n\n\n9\n\"For the sake of legislative history, it should be noted      that my substitute is not intended to apply to title 18,      sections 111, 112, or 113 which already define the penalties      for the use of a firearm in assaulting officials, with      sections 2113 or 2114 concerning armed robberies of the mail      or banks, with section 2231 concerning armed assaults upon      process servers or with chapter 44 which defines other      firearm felonies.\"  Id., at 22232.\n\n\n10\nSimpson pointed out that \"[t]his statement is clearly probative of a legislative judgment that the purpose of \u00a7 924(c) is already served whenever the substantive federal offense provides enhanced punishment for use of a dangerous weapon.\"  435 U.S., at 13, 98 S.Ct., at 913.  Moreover, Representative Poff's remarks were the only ones touching on the present question that were before the House when \u00a7 924(c) was adopted, and it is therefore reasonable to assume that they represent the understanding of the Congressmen who voted for the proposal.11\n\n\n11\nReliance on Representative Poff's statement of legislative intent is consistent with the position taken by the Department of Justice in 1971 when it advised prosecutors not to proceed under \u00a7 924(c)(1) if the predicate felony statute provided for \" 'increased penalties where a firearm is used in the commission of the offense.' \"  Simpson, supra at 16, 98 S.Ct. at 915, quoting 19 U.S.Attys. Bull. No. 3, p. 63 (U.S. Dept. of Justice, 1971). Moreover, this view is fully consistent with two tools of statutory construction relied upon in Simpson.  The first is the oft-cited rule that \" 'ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.' \"  United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347, 92 S.Ct. 515, 522, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971), quoting Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 812, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 1059, 28 L.Ed.2d 493 (1971).  And the second is the principle that a more specific statute will be given precedence over a more general one, regardless of their temporal sequence. Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 489-490, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 1836, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973).  In Simpson, these principles counseled against double enhancement.  They served as \"an outgrowth of our reluctance to increase or multiply punishments absent a clear and definite legislative directive.\"  435 U.S., at 15-16, 98 S.Ct., at 914.  Here they play a similar role, and thus help confirm the conclusion that \u00a7 924(c) may not be applied at all in the present situation.\n\n\n12\nThe Government seeks to minimize the force of these principles of statutory construction by urging (1) that there is no ambiguity in \u00a7 924(c) and thus that the rule of lenity is not properly called into play and (2) that in fact it is \u00a7 924(c) that is the more specific statute because it relates only to firearms while \u00a7 111 would permit enhancement for any dangerous weapon.  We find each contention flawed.  As to the first, the claim that there exists no ambiguity does not stand up.  Plainly the text of the statute fails to address the issue pertinent to decision of these cases\u2014whether Congress intended (1) to provide for enhanced penalties only for crimes not containing their own enhancement provisions, (2) to provide an alternative enhancement provision applicable to all felonies, or (3) to provide a duplicative enhancement provision which would permit double enhancement where the underlying felony was proscribed by a statute like \u00a7 111.  Our task here, as in Simpson, is to ascertain as best we can which approach Congress had in mind.  The rule of lenity, like reference to appropriate legislative materials, is one of the tools we use to do so.\n\n\n13\nThe Government's second contention\u2014that \u00a7 924(c) rather that \u00a7 111 should be viewed as the more specific statute\u2014is both facially unpersuasive12 and likely to lead to curious consequences.  Indeed, were the Government correct we would be forced to conclude that with regard to firearms cases \u00a7 924(c) impliedly repealed all pre-existing enhancement provisions.  Yet there is not a shred of evidence to suggest that this is what Congress intended.  Moreover, such a result would be inconsistent with Simpson13 and in any event would not give the Government what it wants because it would not permit the prosecutor to choose between \u00a7 924(c) and \u00a7 111.\n\n\n14\nIn addition to contesting the rule of lenity and specific-versus-general arguments, the Government contends that our reading of the legislative materials is unreasonable because those who supported the Poff amendment\u2014including Representative Poff himself\u2014were clearly committed to meting out stiff penalties for use of a firearm in the course of a felony and would not have followed any course inconsistent with that commitment.  The argument is overdrawn.  In the first place, we do not think our construction is inconsistent with a congressional desire to deal severely with firearm abuses.  As we understand it, the Government's argument is not that our construction reads Congress to have diminished the penalty for firearm use, but only that our construction fails to enhance that penalty to the hilt.  Yet it is patently clear that Congress too has failed to enhance that penalty to the hilt\u2014it set maximum sentences as well as a variety of other limits on the available punishment.  Thus, while Congress had a general desire to deter firearm abuses, that desire was not unbounded.  Our task here is to locate one of the boundaries, and the inquiry is not advanced by the assertion that Congress wanted no boundaries.\n\n\n15\nMore specifically, some accommodation between \u00a7 924(c) and statutes like \u00a7 111 is obviously necessary.  And since some pre-existing statutes provided for sentences less severe than \u00a7 924(c) and others for penalties more severe,14 any rule of priority would lead in certain circumstances to a punishment less severe that might have been achieved under another rule of priority.  The Government in effect argues that had Representative Poff and his colleagues foreseen this problem they would have eschewed any priority rule and instead rested complete discretion in the prosecutor.  We do not dispute that a rule permitting prosecutors freedom of choice might give greater effect to a legislative desire to increase the penalties for firearm use, but the same could be said of any number of constructions of the statute, including the one rejected in Simpson.  Indeed, by rejecting double enhancement Simpson exposes the stark and unidimensional quality of any calculus which attempts to construe the statute on the basis of an assumption that in enacting \u00a7 924(c) Congress' sole objective was to increase the penalties for firearm use to the maximum extent possible.\n\n\n16\nThe fact that the enhanced sentences authorized in some predicate felony statutes are greater than those set forth in \u00a7 924(c) while those in others are less provides a partial response to the Government's contention that our construction would lead to irrational sentencing patterns in which some less severe crimes are punished more than other more severe ones.15  The fact is that any interpretation might have led to differences in treatment that are not intuitively reasonable. In consequence, the presence of differences here fails to shake our confidence in our construction.  More broadly, it is simply not for this Court to substitute its accommodation between old and new enhancement provisions for the one apparently chosen by Congress.  On the contrary, \"in our constitutional system the commitment to the separation of powers is too fundamental for us to pre-empt congressional action by judicially decreeing what accords with 'commonsense and the public weal.' \"  TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S., at 195, 98 S.Ct., at 2302.\n\nIII\n\n17\nWhat we have said thus far disposes of LaRocca's case by making it clear that he may not be sentenced under \u00a7 924(c) for using his gun to assault the federal officers.  This holding also applies in Busic's case.  But in that case the Government has a fallback position.  Even if a person who uses a gun to violate \u00a7 111 may not be sentenced for doing so under \u00a7 924(c)(1), the argument goes, a person who carries a gun in the commission of a \u00a7 111 violation may be sentenced under \u00a7 924(c)(2) because the enhancement provision of \u00a7 111 does not apply to those who carry but do not use their weapons.  Thus, the Government urges, whatever our holding with regard to LaRocca, Busic may be sentenced under \u00a7 924(c)(2) for carrying his gun while committing the crime of aiding and abetting LaRocca's violation of \u00a7 111.\n\n\n18\nThe central flaw in this argument as applied here is that Busic is being punished for using a weapon.  Through the combination of \u00a7 111 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, he was found guilty as a principal of using a firearm to assault the undercover agents.16 LaRocca's gun, in other words, became Busic's as a matter of law.  And the Government's argument thus amounts to the contention that had Busic shot one gun at the officers and carried another in his belt he could have been punished under \u00a7 111 for the one he fired and under \u00a7 924(c)(2) for the one he did not fire.  Similarly, this argument would suggest, Busic might be punished for carrying a gun in his belt and also for shooting that same gun.  Yet such results are wholly implausible.  They would stand both Simpson and our holding in Part II, supra, on their heads, impute to Congress the unlikely intention to punish each weapon as a separate offense, and create a situation in which aiders and abettors would often be more culpable and more severely punished than those whom they aid and abet.17  We decline to read the statutes to produce such an ungainly result.  It seems to us that our holding of Part II is equally applicable here\u2014Busic's vicarious assault and use of a dangerous weapon are subject to prosecution and punishment under \u00a7 111 and he has been duly prosecuted and punished pursuant to that provision.  In such a case, Simpson, the legislative history, and applicable canons of statutory construction make it clear that neither subsection of \u00a7 924(c) is available.18\n\n\n19\nThese cases are reversed and remanded to the Court of Appeals for proceedings consistent with this opinion.19\n\n\n20\nSo ordered.\n\n\n21\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring.\n\n\n22\nI join the Court's opinion, holding that the decision in Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978), leads to the conclusion that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) is inapplicable where a defendant is charged with committing a substantive federal offense violative of a statute that already provides for enhanced punishment for the use of a firearm.\n\n\n23\nIt should be made clear, however, that the Court of Appeals' initial opinion in these cases, discussed by the Court, ante, at 401-402, reflects the confusion that has existed among lower courts about the meaning of this Court's recent pronouncements respecting the multiple punishments aspect of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  See Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684, 697-698, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1440-1442, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980) (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in judgment).  The Court of Appeals there rejected the view that Congress did not intend the enhancement provisions of \u00a7 924(c) to apply when the substantive offense charged was 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111.  See 3rd Cir., 587 F.2d 577, 581-582, and n. 3.  The decision in Simpson, of course, revealed the error of that holding.  But the Court of Appeals went on to hold that regardless of Congress' intent to provide for enhanced punishment in this context, the Double Jeopardy Clause prevented it from doing so, at least in certain cases.  See id., at 582-584.  I do not subscribe to that view, and write separately only to state, once again, that it is my belief that when defendants are sentenced in a single proceeding, \"the question of what punishments are constitutionally permissible is not different from the question of what punishments the Legislative Branch intended to be imposed.\"  Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S., at 698, 100 S.Ct., at 1441 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in judgment).\n\n\n24\nMr. Justice STEWART, with whom Mr. Justice STEVENS joins, dissenting.\n\n\n25\nUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), \"[w]hoever\u2014(1) uses a firearm to commit any [federal] felony  . . .,  or (2) carries a firearm unlawfully during the commission of any [federal] felony,\" is subject to a term of imprisonment in addition to that provided for the felony in question.  In Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70, which involved both \u00a7 924(c)(1) and a felony proscribed by a statute that itself authorizes an enhanced penalty if a dangerous weapon is used, the Court held that Congress did not intend to authorize the imposition of enhanced punishments for a single criminal transaction under both \u00a7 924(c)(1) and the enhancement provision for the predicate felony.  The Court today concludes that Congress not only did not intend to authorize the imposition of double enhancement, but also did not intend \u00a7 924(c)(1) to apply at all to a felony proscribed by a statute with its own enhancement provision.  I disagree.  It is my view that \u00a7 924(c)(1) was intended to apply to all federal felonies, though subject to the limitation in Simpson against double enhancement.\n\n\n26\nCongress enacted \u00a7 924(c) as part of the Gun Control Act of 1968, Pub.L. 90-618, 82 Stat. 1213.  That legislation, enacted the year in which both Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., were assassinated, was addressed largely to the \"increasing rate of crime and lawlessness and the growing use of firearms in violent crime.\"  H.R.Rep. No. 1577, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 7 (1968), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1968, pp. 4410, 4412.  A primary objective of \u00a7 924(c), as explained by its sponsor, Representative Poff, was to \"persuade the man who is tempted to commit a Federal felony to leave his gun at home.\"  114 Cong.Rec. 22231 (1968).  Towards that end, \u00a7 924(c) provides for a prison term, in addition to that provided for the underlying felony, of not less than 1 year nor more than 10 in the case of a first offender, and of not less than 2 years nor more than 25 in the case of a second or subsequent offender.  It further provides that a sentence imposed under \u00a7 924(c) is not to run concurrently with the sentence for the predicate felony and that, in cases of repeat offenders, the defendant cannot receive probation or a suspended sentence.\n\n\n27\nBefore the enactment of \u00a7 924(c), earlier Congresses had already authorized enhanced penalties for using a dangerous weapon in the commission of certain especially serious federal felonies, including assault on a federal officer, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111, and bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a), (d).  Those enhancement provisions authorize terms of imprisonment of (1) not more than an additional seven years under \u00a7 111, and (2) not more than an additional five years under \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a), (d). Neither provision requires a mandatory minimum additional sentence or authorizes increased additional sentences for recidivists.\n\n\n28\nIn Simpson, the Court held that Congress did not intend the imposition of enhanced punishments under both \u00a7 924(c)(1) and the enhancement provision for a predicate felony.  That conclusion found substantial support in the statement of Representative Poff on the House floor that \"[f]or the sake of legislative history, it should be noted that my [bill] is not intended to apply to title 18, sections 111, 112, or 113 which already define the penalties for the use of a firearm in assaulting officials, with sections 2113 or 2114 concerning armed robberies of the mail or banks, with section 2231 concerning armed assaults upon process servers or with chapter 44 which defines other firearm felonies.\"  114 Cong.Rec. 22232 (1968).\n\n\n29\nThe issue here is not that of double punishment, but instead whether the Government may obtain enhancement of punishment under \u00a7 924(c)(1), rather than under the enhancement provision for the predicate felony.  The Court today concludes that Congress did not intend \u00a7 924(c)(1) to apply at all to a predicate felony proscribed by a statute with its own enhancement provision.  It is thus the Court's view that the Government may obtain an enhanced sentence only under the enhancement provision for the underlying felony itself.\n\n\n30\nAlthough this conclusion finds support in certain passages in Simpson and in the literal terms of Representative Poff's statement on the House floor, it is not supported by the actual holding in Simpson, the language of the statute itself, or a fair appraisal of the intent of Congress in enacting \u00a7 924(c).  In Simpson, the Court decided only that \"in a prosecution growing out of a single transaction of bank robbery with firearms, a defendant may not be sentenced [to enhanced punishments] under both \u00a7 2113(d) and \u00a7 924(c).\"  435 U.S., at 16, 98 S.Ct., at 915 (emphasis added).  The Court did not decide whether \u00a7 924(c)(1) is available as an alternative enhancement provision.  On this latter question, the statutory language is unambiguous, for \u00a7 924(c)(1) provides, by its terms, for an enhanced penalty for \"[w]hoever  . . .  uses a firearm to commit any [federal] felony.\"  (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n31\nTo be sure, Representative Poff stated that his bill \"[was] not intended to apply\" to certain felonies proscribed by statutes that contain their own enhancement provisions.  But that statement could as easily have been directed to the question in Simpson whether \u00a7 924(c)(1) can be invoked in addition to a previously enacted enhancement provision\u2014as to the question in this case whether \u00a7 924(c)(1) can be invoked in lieu of such a provision.\n\n\n32\nI agree with the holding in Simpson that Congress did not intend to \"pyramid\" punishments for the use of a firearm in a single criminal transaction.  Yet I find quite implausible the proposition that Congress, in enacting \u00a7 924(c)(1), did not intend this general enhancement provision\u2014with its stiff sanctions for first offenders and even stiffer sanctions for recidivists\u2014to serve as an alternative source of enhanced punishment for those who commit felonies, such as bank robbery and assaulting a federal officer, that had been previously singled out by Congress as warranting special enhancement, but for which a lesser enhancement sanction than that imposed by \u00a7 924(c) had been authorized.  In the light of the expressed concerns of Congress in enacting the Gun Control Act of 1968 in general and \u00a7 924(c)(1) in particular, it is far more reasonable to conclude that Congress intended \u00a7 924(c)(1) to mean precisely what it says, namely, that it applies to any federal felony.\n\n\n33\nIt is my view, in sum, that \u00a7 924(c)(1) applies to all federal felonies, though subject to the limitation in Simpson against double punishment.  Under this reading of the statute, the Government may obtain an enhanced sentence under either \u00a7 924(c)(1) or the enhancement provision for the predicate felony, but not under both.\n\n\n34\nFor the foregoing reasons, I dissent.*\n\n\n35\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting.\n\n\n36\nI dissented from this Court's decision in Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978), and continue to believe that case was wrongly decided.  Now, as then, I am quite amazed at this Court's ability to say that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) \"tells us nothing about the way Congress intended to mesh the new enhancement scheme with analogous provisions in pre-existing statutes defining federal crimes,\" ante, at 405, even though that section provides quite clearly that the use of a firearm in the commission of \"any felony\" shall be punished by up to 10 years' imprisonment \"in addition to the punishment provided for the commission of such felony  . . . .\"  Nor do I find any more persuasive the Court's rehash of the legislative history of \u00a7 924(c), including Simpson \u00a7 unwarranted reliance upon the remark of Representative Poff, a remark that the Court today labels \"the Poff rule,\" see ante, at 409, n. 14, and that might more properly be labeled \"the Poff amendment\" (albeit not intended as such by its proponent).\n\n\n37\nWere Simpson demonstrably a case of statutory construction, I could acquiesce to the Court's reading of \u00a7 924(c) in the interest of stare decisis.  Simpson, however, was based to an unstated degree on this Court's assumption that \u00a7 924(c) raised \"the prospect of double jeopardy\" because it provided for additional punishment on \"precisely the same factual showing\" as would be necessary for conviction of the underlying felony involved in that case.  See 435 U.S., at 11, 98 S.Ct., at 912.  In Simpson the Court treated the question of the constitutionality of \u00a7 924(c) as if it were separate from the question whether Congress intended to allow cumulative punishment, insisting at one point that \"[b]efore an examination is made to determine whether cumulative punishments for the two offenses are constitutionally permissible, it is necessary  . . .  to determine whether Congress intended to subject the defendant to multiple penalties for the single criminal transaction in which he engaged.\"  435 U.S., at 11-12, 98 S.Ct., at 913.  In dissent, I noted the constitutional undercurrents of the Court's opinion and suggested its concerns were \"gauzy\" and \"metaphysic[al].\"  Id., at 18, 98 S.Ct., at 915.\n\n\n38\nRecently, this Court unanimously rejected Simpson 's constitutional premise.  In Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980), six Members of this Court held that Congress' intent to impose cumulative punishments at a single criminal proceeding completely controlled the question of double jeopardy.  See id., at 688-689, 100 S.Ct., at 1436;  id., at 697-698, 100 S.Ct., at 1441 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in judgment).  See also ante, at 697-698 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring). Three other Members of this Court, including myself, argued that the permissibility of cumulative punishments in the same criminal proceeding presented no double jeopardy question whatsoever.  See Whalen v. United States, supra, at 696, 100 S.Ct., at 1440 (WHITE, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment);  at 701-707, 100 S.Ct., at 1443-1446 (REHNQUIST, J., joined by BURGER, C. J., dissenting).  I believe that this Court, having thus disposed of Simpson \u00a7 constitutional underpinnings, should reconsider its holding that \u00a7 924(c) does not, in fact, apply to \"any felony.\" I know of no cases besides Simpson and the present decision where this Court has taken a criminal statute absolutely clear on its face, has looked to the legislative history to create an \"ambiguity,\" and then has resolved that ambiguity in a manner totally at odds with the statute's plain wording.  Because I believe Simpson was wrongly decided, and because this Court has now repudiated Simpson \u00a7 constitutional premise, I would overrule Simpson, vacate the judgments below, and remand for reconsideration by the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n\n*\n The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.  See United States v. Detroit Lumber Co., 200 U.S. 321, 337, 26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50 L.Ed. 499.\n\n\n1\n The facts are recited in the opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.  587 F.2d 577, 579-580 (1978).\n\n\n2\n The five narcotics counts alleged violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 843(b), and 846.  The firearms counts involving both petitioners charged violations of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(c), 5861(d), and 5871, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(h) and 924(a).  LaRocca was named in six of these counts and Busic in five.  In addition, Busic was convicted on three counts of unlawful firearms possession in violation of 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1).  The indictment is reproduced at App. 5-15.\n\n\n3\n The \u00a7 924(c) counts on which the two were convicted recited as predicate felonies both the narcotics violations and the assaults on federal officers.  In the courts below the Government attempted to support the \u00a7 924(c) convictions in part by arguing that whatever their validity when superimposed on the assault charges, they could validly be grounded on the drug counts.  The Court of Appeals rejected this contention, concluding that the jury might have found the drug conspiracy to have come to an end before the robbery and assault.  587 F.2d, at 584, n. 5, and 588, n. 3.  The Government does not press this argument in this Court, and we accordingly treat the cases as though the \u00a7 924(c) charges recited only the assaults on federal officers as predicate felonies.\n\n\n4\n Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 provides as follows:\n\"Whoever forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with any person designated in section 1114 of this title while engaged in or on account of the performance of his official duties, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\n\"Whoever, in the commission of any such acts uses a deadly or dangerous weapon, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\"\nAmong the persons designated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114 are officers or employees of the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\n\n5\n Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) provides:\n\"Whoever\u2014\n\"(1) uses a firearm to commit any felony for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, or\n\"(2) carries a firearm unlawfully during the commission of any felony for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States[,]\n\"shall, in addition to the punishment provided for the commission of such felony, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for not less than one year nor more than ten years.  In the case of his second or subsequent conviction under this subsection, such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for not less than two nor more than twenty-five years and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court shall not suspend the sentence in the case of a second or subsequent conviction of such person or give him a probationary sentence, nor shall the term of imprisonment imposed under this subsection run concurrently with any term of imprisonment imposed for the commission of such felony.\"\n\n\n6\n For present purposes, \u00a7\u00a7 2113 and 111 are fully analogous. Therefore, what Simpson held of the relationship between \u00a7 924(c) and the one applies to that section's relationship with the other as well.\n\n\n7\n Petitioners in Simpson had been sentenced under both enhancement provisions, 435 U.S., at 9, 98 S.Ct., at 911.\n\n\n8\n Simpson's final paragraph stated in part:  \"Accordingly, we hold that in a prosecution growing out of a single transaction of bank robbery with firearms, a defendant may not be sentenced under both \u00a7 2113(d) and \u00a7 924(c).\"  Id., at 16, 98 S.Ct., at 915.\n\n\n9\n Section 924(c) was enacted as part of the Gun Control Act of 1968 in the wake of the assassinations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.  It clearly was an attempt to take major steps to prevent firearm abuses.  Thus, it is argued, it is unlikely that Congress would have wanted the severe penalties of \u00a7 924(c) to be pre-empted by less stringent penalties provided in pre-existing enhancement provisions.\n\n\n10\n For example, the Government notes that under such a holding a person who breaks into a Post Office in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2115, which contains no enhancement provision, could receive an extra 10 years under \u00a7 924(c) for using a gun to shoot the lock off.  In contrast, the sentence of a person who draws a gun and fires a number of shots while robbing a bank could not be enhanced under that provision because the bank robbery statute's enhancement clause would take precedence.  That clause, \u00a7 2113(d), permits a sentence of up to 25 years, but even if he had not used a weapon this person could have received 20 years under \u00a7 2113(a). Accordingly, the incremental penalty the bank robber can receive for using the firearm is only 5 years as opposed to 10 for the Post Office robber.\n\n\n11\n This interpretation receives additional support from the fact that the conference Committee chose the Poff version over a Senate proposal which, according to its sponsor, 114 Cong.Rec. 27142 (1968), would have permitted enhancement for the use of a firearm even where the predicate offense contained its own enhancement clause.  H.R.Conf.Rep.No.1956, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 31-32 (1968), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1968, p. 4410.  We recognize, as the Government points out, that the Senate version differed in other respects as well;  but insofar as it points in any direction this chain of events supports reliance on the Poff statement.\n\n\n12\n Indeed, \u00a7 924(c) is itself fairly broad.  It refers to \"firearms,\" a term defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921(a)(3) and (4) to include bombs, grenades, rockets, mines, and similar devices in addition to guns.\n\n\n13\n The disposition in Simpson was to remand for proceedings consistent with the opinion of the Court.  On remand, the Court of Appeals vacated the \u00a7 924(c) sentences and approved and affirmed those under \u00a7 2113(d)\u2014a disposition that would have been improper were the Government correct in its specificity argument.\n\n\n14\n Section 924(c) provides for maximum incremental penalties for use of a firearm of 10 years for a first offender and 25 years for a second offender.  Under \u00a7 2113, the incremental penalty available for use of a dangerous weapon in the course of an otherwise forceful bank robbery is 5 years (25 years under \u00a7 2113(d) less 20 years under \u00a7 2113(a)), while the incremental penalty for using a weapon in the course of an otherwise nonviolent robbery is 15 years (25 years less 10 years under \u00a7 2113(b)) if the goods taken are worth more than $100 and 24 years (25 years less 1 year) if the goods taken are worth less.  And under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2114, another statute referred to by Representative Poff, the incremental cost to the defendant of using a gun to assault a person having custody of the mail or property of the United States is 15 years.  Thus, a ruling making \u00a7 924(c) pre-emptive would increase some incremental penalties while actually decreasing others.  In contrast, the Poff rule merely leaves these penalties where they were set by Congress in the first place-it makes no existing firearm penalty smaller or larger.\n\n\n15\n One of the Government's examples is described in n. 10, supra.  The unlikeliness of the hypothetical and the fact that it compares only incremental and not total penalties suggest that the possibility of genuinely troubling comparative sentences may be exaggerated.\n\n\n16\n Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 provides in relevant part that \"[w]hoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.\"\n\n\n17\n On these facts, for example, the Government's view would permit Busic\u2014the aider and abettor\u2014to be sentenced under both \u00a7 924(c) and \u00a7 111\u2014while LaRocca\u2014the triggerman\u2014could be sentenced only under the latter.  That this is so is a product not of our holding in Part II, but of the Government's theory itself.  This is quite clear if one assumes for purposes of argument that LaRocca could have been punished under \u00a7 924(c)(1) for using his gun.  Were that the case, Busic, too would have been guilty of that crime as an aider and abettor.  And the Government's argument here would lead to the conclusion that he could also be guilty of violating \u00a7 924(c)(2) by carrying his own gun.  In short, while he neither shot now drew his gun, he would have been subject to fully twice the penalties that would have faced his more culpable comrade.\n\n\n18\n Our result with regard to Busic flows as much from the logic and language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 as from anything peculiar to \u00a7 924(c).  Section 2 makes Busic punishable \"as a principal,\" and those words mean what they say.  One consequence is that aiders and abettors may be held vicariously liable \"regardless of the fact that they may be incapable of committing the specific violation which they are charged to have aided and abetted.\" S.Rep. No. 1020, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., 7 (1951) U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.Serv. 1951, pp. 2578, 2583.  Another is that there will inevitably exist cases in which a decision to treat an aider and abettor as a principal may be inconsistent with prosecuting and punishing him as well for some of his individual acts of aiding and abetting.  Phrased differently, once he has been treated as a principal some of his lesser acts in furtherance of the central violation may merge into it.  On these facts, \u00a7 2 appears to require that we treat Busic as though he used LaRocca's gun to commit this assault.  It would be incongruous to treat him at the same time as a separate individual punishable as though he had carried a different gun in the course of a different crime.\n\n\n19\n The Government makes a conditional plea that should we find \u00a7 924(c) to be inapplicable to these petitioners we vacate not only the \u00a7 924(c) sentences, but also those imposed by the District Court under \u00a7 111.  This, the Government urges, would permit that court to resentence petitioners under the enhancement provision of the latter statute.  The argument is that the District Court intended to deal severely with the assaults in question and should not be prevented from doing so by its choice of the incorrect enhancement provision.  The Court of Appeals has not considered this contention in this context and we are reluctant to do so without the benefit of that court's views. Accordingly, we express no opinion as to whether in the particular circumstances of these cases such a disposition would be permissible.\n\n\n*\n I do not agree with the Court of Appeals that Busic could be given enhanced punishments both for aiding and abetting LaRocca's armed assault on a federal officer, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 111, and for unlawfully carrying his own gun while doing so, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2).  Since Busic was convicted of armed assault \"as a principal\" under the aiding and abetting statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 he must be viewed as having used LaRocca's gun as well as carried his own in the course of committing the offense;  and, like the Court, ante, at 410-411, I am unpersuaded that \u00a7 924(c) authorizes cumulative punishments for the use of one gun and the unlawful carrying of another in a single criminal transaction.  It is my view, therefore, that Busic could have been given an enhanced sentence under either \u00a7 924(c)(2) or \u00a7\u00a7 2, 111, but not under both.\n\n\n","label":0}

BOLDEN et al.\nNo. 77-1844.\nArgued March 19, 1979.\nReargued Oct. 29, 1979.\nDecided April 22, 1980.\n\n\nSyllabus\n\nMobile, Ala., is governed by a Commission consisting of three members elected at large who jointly exercise all legislative, executive, and administrative power in the city.  Appellees brought a class action in Federal District Court against the city and the incumbent Commissioners on behalf of all Negro citizens of the city, alleging, inter alia, that the practice of electing the City Commissioners at large unfairly diluted the voting strength of Negroes in violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.  Although finding that Negroes in Mobile \"register and vote without hindrance,\" the District Court nevertheless held that the at-large electoral system violated the Fifteenth Amendment and invidiously discriminated against Negroes in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and ordered that the Commission be disestablished and replaced by a Mayor and a Council elected from single-member districts.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.\nHeld :  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded. Pp. 61-80 (opinion of STEWART, J.);  Pp. 80-83 (opinion of BLACKMUN, J.);  Pp. 83-94 (opinion of STEVENS, J.).\n5th Cir., 571 F.2d 238, reversed and remanded.\nMr. Justice STEWART, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice POWELL, and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST, concluded:\n\n\n1\n1. Mobile's at-large electoral system does not violate the rights of the city's Negro voters in contravention of the Fifteenth Amendment.  Racially discriminatory motivation is a necessary ingredient of a Fifteenth Amendment violation.  The Amendment does not entail the right to have Negro candidates elected but prohibits only purposefully discriminatory denial or abridgment by government of the freedom to vote \"on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\"  Here, having found that Negroes in Mobile register and vote without hindrance, the courts below erred in believing that appellants invaded the protection of the Fifteenth Amendment.  Pp. 61-65.\n\n\n2\n2. Nor does Mobile's at-large electoral system violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pp. 65-80.\n\n\n3\n(a) Only if there is purposeful discrimination can there be a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  And this principle applies to claims of racial discrimination affecting voting just as it does to other claims of racial discrimination.  Pp. 66-68.\n\n\n4\n(b) Disproportionate effects alone are insufficient to establish a claim of unconstitutional racial vote dilution.  Where the character of a law is readily explainable on grounds apart from race, as would nearly always be true where, as here, an entire system of local governance is brought into question, disproportionate impact alone cannot be decisive, and courts must look to other evidence to support a finding of discriminatory purpose.  Pp. 68-70.\n\n\n5\n(c) Even assuming that an at-large municipal electoral system such as Mobile's is constitutionally indistinguishable from the election of a few members of a state legislature in multimember districts, it is clear that the evidence in this case fell far short of showing that appellants \"conceived or operated [a] purposeful devic[e] to further racial . . . discrimination,\" Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 149, 91 S.Ct. 1858, 1872, 29 L.Ed.2d 363.  Pp. 70-74.\n\n\n6\n(d) The Equal Protection Clause does not require proportional representation as an imperative of political organization.  While the Clause confers a substantive right to participate in elections on an equal basis with other qualified voters, this right does not protect any \"political group,\" however defined, from electoral defeat.  Since Mobile is a unitary electoral district and the Commission elections are conducted at large, there can be no claim that the \"one person, one vote\" principle has been violated, and therefore nobody's vote has been \"diluted\" in the sense in which that word was used in Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506.  Pp. 75-80.\n\n\n7\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN concluded that the relief afforded appellees by the District Court was not commensurate with the sound exercise of judicial discretion.  The court at least should have considered alternative remedial orders to converting Mobile's government to a mayor-council system, and in failing to do so the court appears to have been overly concerned with eliminating at-large elections per se, rather than with structuring an electoral system that provided an opportunity for black voters to participate in the city's government on an equal footing with whites.  Pp. 80-83.\n\n\n8\nMr. Justice STEVENS concluded that the proper standard for adjudging the constitutionality of a political structure, such as Mobile's, that treats all individuals as equals but adversely affects the political strength of an identifiable minority group, is the same whether the minority is identified by a racial, ethnic, religious, or economic characteristic;  that Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110, suggests that the standard asks (1) whether the political structure is manifestly not the product of a routine or traditional decision, (2) whether it has a significant adverse impact on a minority group, and (3) whether it is unsupported by any neutral justification and thus was either totally irrational or entirely motivated by a desire to curtail the political strength of the minority;  and that the standard focuses on the objective effects of the political decision rather than the subjective motivation of the decisionmaker.  Under this standard the choice to retain Mobile's commission form of government must be accepted as constitutionally permissible even though the choice may well be the product of mixed motivation, some of which is invidious.  Pp. 83-94.\n\n\n9\nCharles S. Rhyne, Washington, D. C., for appellants.\n\n\n10\nJames U. Blacksher, Mobile, Ala., for appellees.\n\n\n11\nJames P. Turner, Washington, D. C., for the United States, as amicus curiae, in support of appellees.\n\n\n12\nMr. Justice STEWART announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice POWELL, and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST joined.\n\n\n13\nThe city of Mobile, Ala., has since 1911 been governed by a City Commission consisting of three members elected by the voters of the city at large.  The question in this case is whether this at-large system of municipal elections violates the rights of Mobile's Negro voters in contravention of federal statutory or constitutional law.\n\n\n14\nThe appellees brought this suit in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Alabama as a class action on behalf of all Negro citizens of Mobile.1  Named as defendants were the city and its three incumbent Commissioners, who are the appellants before this Court.  The complaint alleged that the practice of electing the City Commissioners at large unfairly diluted the voting strength of Negroes in violation of \u00a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and of the Fifteenth Amendment.  Following a bench trial, the District Court found that the constitutional rights of the appellees had been violated, entered a judgment in their favor, and ordered that the City Commission be disestablished and replaced by a municipal government consisting of a Mayor and a City Council with members elected from single-member districts.  423 F.Supp. 384.3  The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in its entirety, 5th Cir., 571 F.2d 238, agreeing that Mobile's at-large elections operated to discriminate against Negroes in violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, id., at 245, and finding that the remedy formulated by the District Court was appropriate.  An appeal was taken to this Court, and we noted probable jurisdiction, 439 U.S. 815, 99 S.Ct. 75, 58 L.Ed.2d 106. The case was originally argued in the 1978 Term, and was reargued in the present Term.\n\n\n15\n* In Alabama, the form of municipal government a city may adopt is governed by state law.  Until 1911, cities not covered by specific legislation were limited to governing themselves through a mayor and city council.4  In that year, the Alabama Legislature authorized every large municipality to adopt a commission form of government.5  Mobile established its City Commission in the same year, and has maintained that basic system of municipal government ever since.\n\n\n16\nThe three Commissioners jointly exercise all legislative, executive and administrative power in the municipality.  They are required after election to designate one of their number as Mayor, a largely ceremonial office, but no formal provision is made for allocating specific executive or administrative duties among the three.6  As required by the state law enacted in 1911, each candidate for the Mobile City Commission runs for election in the city at large for a term of four years in one of three numbered posts, and may be elected only by a majority of the total vote.  This is the same basic electoral system that is followed by literally thousands of municipalities and other local governmental units throughout the Nation.7\n\nII\n\n17\nAlthough required by general principles of judicial administration to do so, Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. McLaughlin, 323 U.S. 101, 105, 65 S.Ct. 152, 154, 89 L.Ed. 101; Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 347, 56 S.Ct. 466, 483, 80 L.Ed. 688 (Brandeis, J., concurring), neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals addressed the complaint's statutory claim\u2014that the Mobile electoral system violates \u00a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Even a cursory examination of that claim, however, clearly discloses that it adds nothing to the appellees' complaint.\n\n\n18\nSection 2 of the Voting Rights Act provides:\n\n\n19\n\"No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or      standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied      by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge the      right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account      of race or color.\"  79 Stat. 437, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7      1973.\n\n\n20\nAssuming, for present purposes, that there exists a private right of action to enforce this statutory provision,8 it is apparent that the language of \u00a7 2 no more than elaborates upon that of the Fifteenth Amendment,9 and the sparse legislative history of \u00a7 2 makes clear that it was intended to have an effect no different from that of the Fifteenth Amendment itself.\n\n\n21\nSection 2 was an uncontroversial provision in proposed legislation whose other provisions engendered protracted dispute. The House Report on the bill simply recited that \u00a7 2 \"grants  . . .  a right to be free from enactment or enforcement of voting qualifications  . . .  or practices which deny or abridge the right to vote on account of race or color.\"  H.R.Rep. No. 439, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 23 (1965), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, 1965, pp. 2437, 2453.  See also S.Rep. No. 162, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 3, pp. 19-20 (1965).  The view that this section simply restated the prohibitions already contained in the Fifteenth Amendment was expressed without contradiction during the Senate hearings.  Senator Dirksen indicated at one point that all States, whether or not covered by the preclearance provisions of \u00a7 5 of the proposed legislation, were prohibited from discriminating against Negro voters by \u00a7 2, which he termed \"almost a rephrasing of the 15th [A]mendment.\"  Attorney General Katzenbach agreed. See Voting Rights:  Hearings on S. 1564 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 208 (1965).\n\n\n22\nIn view of the section's language and its sparse but clear legislative history, it is evident that this statutory provision adds nothing to the appellees' Fifteenth Amendment claim.  We turn, therefore, to a consideration of the validity of the judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nIII\n\n23\nThe Court's early decisions under the Fifteenth Amendment established that it imposes but one limitation on the powers of the States.  It forbids them to discriminate against Negroes in matters having to do with voting.  See Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651, 665, 4 S.Ct. 152, 159, 28 L.Ed. 274;  Neal v. Delaware, 103 U.S. 370, 389-390, 26 L.Ed. 567;  United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 555-556, 23 L.Ed. 588;  United States v. Reese, 92 U.S. 214, 23 L.Ed. 563.  The Amendment's command and effect are wholly negative.  \"The Fifteenth Amendment does not confer the right of suffrage upon any one,\" but has \"invested the citizens of the United States with a new constitutional right which is within the protecting power of Congress.  That right is exemption from discrimination in the exercise of the elective franchise on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\"  Id., at 217-218.\n\n\n24\nOur decisions, moreover, have made clear that action by a State that is racially neutral on its face violates the Fifteenth Amendment only if motivated by a discriminatory purpose.  In Guinn v. United States, 238 U.S. 347, 35 S.Ct. 926, 59 L.Ed. 1340, this Court struck down a \"grandfather\" clause in a state constitution exempting from the requirement that voters be literate any person or the descendants of any person who had been entitled to vote before January 1, 1866.  It was asserted by way of defense that the provision was immune from successful challenge, since a law could not be found unconstitutional either \"by attributing to the legislative authority an occult motive,\" or \"because of conclusions concerning its operation in practical execution and resulting discrimination arising  . . .  from inequalities naturally inhering in those who must come within the standard in order to enjoy the right to vote.\"  Id., at 359, 35 S.Ct., at 929. Despite this argument, the Court did not hesitate to hold the grandfather clause unconstitutional, because it was not \"possible to discover any basis in reason for the standard thus fixed other than the purpose\" to circumvent the Fifteenth Amendment.   Id., at 365, 35 S.Ct., at 931.\n\n\n25\nThe Court's more recent decisions confirm the principle that racially discriminatory motivation is a necessary ingredient of a Fifteenth Amendment violation.  In Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed. 2d 110, the Court held that allegations of a racially motivated gerrymander of municipal boundaries stated a claim under the Fifteenth Amendment.  The constitutional infirmity of the state law in that case, according to the allegations of the complaint, was that in drawing the municipal boundaries the legislature was \"solely concerned with segregating white and colored voters by fencing Negro citizens out of town so as to deprive them of their pre-existing municipal vote.\"  Id., at 341, 81 S.Ct., at 127.  The Court made clear that in the absence of such an invidious purpose, a State is constitutionally free to redraw political boundaries in any manner it chooses.  Id., at 347, 81 S.Ct., at 130.10\n\n\n26\nIn Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 603, 11 L.Ed.2d 512, the Court upheld by like reasoning a state congressional reapportionment statute against claims that district lines had been racially gerrymandered, because the plaintiffs failed to prove that the legislature \"was either motivated by racial considerations or in fact drew the districts on racial lines\";  or that the statute \"was the product of a state contrivance to segregate on the basis of race or place of origin.\" Id., at 56, 58, 84 S.Ct., at 605-06.11  See also Lassiter v. Northampton Election Bd., 360 U.S. 45, 79 S.Ct. 985, 3 L.Ed.2d 1072;  Lane v. Wilson, 307 U.S. 268, 275-277, 59 S.Ct. 872, 876, 83 L.Ed. 1281.\n\n\n27\nWhile other of the Court's Fifteenth Amendment decisions have dealt with different issues, none has questioned the necessity of showing purposeful discrimination in order to show a Fifteenth Amendment violation.  The cases of Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649, 64 S.Ct. 757, 88 L.Ed. 987, and Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461, 73 S.Ct. 809, 97 L.Ed. 1152, for example, dealt with the question whether a State was so involved with racially discriminatory voting practices as to invoke the Amendment's protection.  Although their facts differed somewhat, the question in both cases was whether the State was sufficiently implicated in the conduct of racially exclusionary primary elections to make that discrimination an abridgment of the right to vote by a State.  Since the Texas Democratic Party primary in Smith v. Allwright was regulated by statute, and only party nominees chosen in a primary were placed on the ballot for the general election, the Court concluded that the state Democratic Party had become the agency of the State, and that the State thereby had \"endorse[d], adopt[ed] and enforce[d] the discrimination against Negroes, practiced by a party.\"  321 U.S., at 664, 64 S.Ct., at 765.\n\n\n28\nTerry v. Adams, supra, posed a more difficult question of state involvement.  The primary election challenged in that case was conducted by a county political organization, the Jaybird Association, that was neither authorized nor regulated under state law.  The candidates chosen in the Jaybird primary, however, invariably won in the subsequent Democratic primary and in the general election, and the Court found that the Fifteenth Amendment had been violated.  Although the several supporting opinions differed in their formulation of this conclusion, there was agreement that the State was involved in the purposeful exclusion of Negroes from participation in the election process.\n\n\n29\nThe appellees have argued in this Court that Smith v. Allwright and Terry v. Adams support the conclusion that the at-large system of elections in Mobile is unconstitutional, reasoning that the effect of racially polarized voting in Mobile is the same as that of a racially exclusionary primary.  The only characteristic, however, of the exclusionary primaries that offended the Fifteenth Amendment was that Negroes were not permitted to vote in them.  The difficult question was whether the \"State ha[d] had a hand in\" the patent dis crimination practiced by a nominally private organization.  Terry v. Adams, supra, at 473, 73 S.Ct., at 815 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).\n\n\n30\nThe answer to the appellees' argument is that, as the District Court expressly found, their freedom to vote has not been denied or abridged by anyone.  The Fifteenth Amendment does not entail the right to have Negro candidates elected, and neither Smith v. Allwright nor Terry v. Adams contains any implication to the contrary.  That Amendment prohibits only purposefully discriminatory denial or abridgment by government of the freedom to vote \"on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\"  Having found that Negroes in Mobile \"register and vote without hindrance,\" the District Court and Court of Appeals were in error in believing that the appellants invaded the protection of that Amendment in the present case.\n\nIV\n\n31\nThe Court of Appeals also agreed with the District Court that Mobile's at-large electoral system violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  There remains for consideration, therefore, the validity of its judgment on that score.\n\nA.\n\n32\nThe claim that at-large electoral schemes unconstitutionally deny to some persons the equal protection of the laws has been advanced in numerous cases before this Court.  That contention has been raised most often with regard to multimember constituencies within a state legislative apportionment system.  The constitutional objection to multimember districts is not and cannot be that, as such, they depart from apportionment on a population basis in violation of Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506, and its progeny.  Rather the focus in such cases has been on the lack of representation multimember districts afford various elements of the voting population in a system of representative legislative democracy.  \"Criticism [of multimember districts] is rooted in their winnertake-all aspects, their tendency to submerge minorities  . . ., a general preference for legislatures reflecting community interests as closely as possible and disenchantment with political parties and elections as devices to settle policy differences between contending interests.\"  Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 158-159, 91 S.Ct. 1858, 1877, 29 L.Ed.2d 363.\n\n\n33\nDespite repeated constitutional attacks upon multimember legislative districts, the Court has consistently held that they are not unconstitutional per se, e. g., White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314;  Whitcomb v. Chavis, supra;  Kilgarlin v. Hill, 386 U.S. 120, 87 S.Ct. 820, 17 L.Ed.2d 771;  Burns v. Richardson, 384 U.S. 73, 86 S.Ct. 1286, 16 L.Ed.2d 376;  Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433, 85 S.Ct. 498, 13 L.Ed.2d 401.12  We have recognized, however, that such legislative apportionments could violate the Fourteenth Amendment if their purpose were invidiously to minimize or cancel out the voting potential of racial or ethnic minorities.  See White v. Regester, supra;  Whitcomb v. Chavis, supra;  Burns v. Richardson, supra; Fortson v. Dorsey, supra.  To prove such a purpose it is not enough to show that the group allegedly discriminated against has not elected representatives in proportion to its numbers.  White v. Regester, supra, 412 U.S., at 765-766, 93 S.Ct., at 2339; Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S., at 149-150, 91 S.Ct., at 1872.  A plaintiff must prove that the disputed plan was \"conceived or operated as [a] purposeful devic[e] to further racial . . . discrimination,\" id., at 149, 91 S.Ct. at 1872.\n\n\n34\nThis burden of proof is simply one aspect of the basic principle that only if there is purposeful discrimination can there be a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597; Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450;  Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 60 L.Ed.2d 870.  The Court explicitly indicated in Washington v. Davis that this principle applies to claims of racial discrimination affecting voting just as it does to other claims of racial discrimination. Indeed, the Court's opinion in that case viewed Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 603, 11 L.Ed.2d 512, as an apt illustration of the principle that an illicit purpose must be proved before a constitutional violation can be found.  The Court said:\n\n\n35\n\"The rule is the same in other contexts.  Wright v.      Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 603, 11 L.Ed.2d 512      (1964), upheld a New York congressional apportionment statute      against claims that district lines had been racially      gerrymandered.  The challenged districts were made up      predominantly of whites or of minority races, and their      boundaries were irregularly drawn.  The challengers did not      prevail because they failed to prove that the New York      Legislature 'was either motivated by racial considerations or      in fact drew the districts on racial lines';  the plaintiffs      had not shown that the statute 'was the product of a state      contrivance to segregate on the basis of race or place of      origin.'  Id., at 56, 58, 84 S.Ct., at 605.  The dissenters      were in agreement that the issue was whether the 'boundaries      . . .  were purposefully drawn on racial lines.'  Id., at 67,      84 S.Ct., at 611.\"   Washington v. Davis, supra, 426 U.S., at      240, 96 S.Ct., at 2047-48.\n\n\n36\nMore recently, in Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., supra, the Court again relied on Wright v. Rockefeller to illustrate the principle that \"[p]roof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\"  429 U.S., at 265, 97 S.Ct., at 563.  Although dicta may be drawn from a few of the Court's earlier opinions suggesting that disproportionate effects alone may establish a claim of unconstitutional racial voter dilution, the fact is that such a view is not supported by any decision of this Court.13  More importantly, such a view is not consistent with the meaning of the Equal Protection Clause as it has been understood in a variety of other contexts involving alleged racial discrimination.  Washington v. Davis, supra (employment); Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp., supra (zoning); Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colo., 413 U.S. 189, 208, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 2697, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (public schools);  Akins v. Texas, 325 U.S. 398, 403-404, 65 S.Ct. 1276, 1279, 89 L.Ed. 1692 (jury selection).\n\n\n37\nIn only one case has the Court sustained a claim that multimember legislative districts unconstitutionally diluted the voting strength of a discrete group.  That case was White v. Regester.  There the Court upheld a constitutional challenge by Negroes and Mexican-Americans to parts of a legislative reapportionment plan adopted by the State of Texas.  The plaintiffs alleged that the multimember districts for the two counties in which they resided minimized the effect of their votes in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Court held that the plaintiffs had been able to \"produce evidence to support findings that the political processes leading to nomination and election were not equally open to participation by the group[s] in question.\"  412 U.S., at 766, 767, 93 S.Ct. at 2339.  In so holding, the Court relied upon evidence in the record that included a long history of official discrimination against minorities as well as indifference to their needs and interests on the part of white elected officials.  The Court also found in each county additional factors that restricted the access of minority groups to the political process.  In one county, Negroes effectively were excluded from the process of slating candidates for the Democratic Party, while the plaintiffs in the other county were Mexican-Americans who \"suffer[ed] a cultural and language barrier\" that made \"participation in community processes extremely difficult, PARTICULARLY  . . .  WITH RESPECT TO THE POLITICAL LIFE\" OF THE COUNTY.  id. at 768, 93 S.Ct., at 2340-41 (footnote omitted).\n\n\n38\nWhite v. Regester is thus consistent with \"the basic equal protection principle that the invidious equality of a law claimed to be racially discriminatory must ultimately be traced to a racially discriminatory purpose,\" Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S., at 240, 96 S.Ct., at 2048.  The Court stated the constitutional question in White to be whether the \"multimember districts [were] being used invidiously to minimize or cancel out or minimize the voting strength of racial groups,\" 412 U.S., at 765, 93 S.Ct., at 2339 (emphasis added), strongly indicating that only a purposeful dilution of the plaintiffs' vote would offend the Equal Protection Clause.14 Moreover, much of the evidence on which the Court relied in that case was relevant only for the reason that \"official action will not be held unconstitutional solely because it results in a racially disproportionate impact.\"  Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S., at 264-265, 97 S.Ct., at 563.  Of course, \"[t]he impact of the official action\u2014whether it 'bears more heavily on one race than another,' Washington v. Davis, supra, 426 U.S., at 242, 96 S.Ct., at 2049\u2014may provide an important starting point.\"  Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., supra, at 266, 97 S.Ct., at 564.  But where the character of a law is readily explainable on grounds apart from race, as would nearly always be true where, as here, an entire system of local governance is brought into question, disproportionate impact alone cannot be decisive, and courts must look to other evidence to support a finding of discriminatory purpose.  See ibid.;   Washington v. Davis, supra, at 242, 96 S.Ct., at 2048.\n\n\n39\nWe may assume, for present purposes, that an at-large election of city officials with all the legislative, executive, and administrative power of the municipal government is constitutionally indistinguishable from the election of a few members of a state legislative body in multimember districts although this may be a rash assumption.15  But even making this assumption, it is clear that the evidence in the present case fell far short of showing that the appellants \"conceived or operated [a] purposeful devic[e] to further racial . . . discrimination.\" Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S., at 149, 91 S.Ct., at 1872.\n\n\n40\nThe District Court assessed the appellees' claims in light of the standard that had been articulated by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Zimmer v. McKeithen, 485 F.2d 1297.  That case, coming before Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597, was quite evidently decided upon the misunderstanding that it is not necessary to show a discriminatory purpose in order to prove a violation of the Equal Protection Clause\u2014that proof of a discriminatory effect is sufficient.  See 485 F.2d, at 1304-1305, and n. 16.16\n\n\n41\nIn light of the criteria identified in Zimmer, the District Court based its conclusion of unconstitutionality primarily on the fact that no Negro had ever been elected to the City Commission, apparently because of the pervasiveness of racially polarized voting in Mobile.  The trial court also found that city officials had not been as responsive to the interests of Negroes as to those of white persons.  On the basis of these findings, the court concluded that the political processes in Mobile were not equally open to Negroes, despite its seemingly inconsistent findings that there were no inhibitions against Negroes becoming candidates, and that in fact Negroes had registered and voted without hindrance. 423 F.Supp., at 387.  Finally, with little additional discussion, the District Court held that Mobile's at-large electoral system was invidiously discriminating against Negroes in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.17\n\n\n42\nIn affirming the District Court, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment reaches only purposeful discrimination,18 but held that one way a plaintiff may establish this illicit purpose is by adducing evidence that satisfies the criteria of its decision in Zimmer v. McKeithen, supra.  Thus, because the appellees had proved an \"aggregate\" of the Zimmer factors, the Court of Appeals concluded that a discriminatory purpose had been proved.  That approach, however, is inconsistent with our decisions in Washington v. Davis, supra, and Arlington Heights, supra.  Although the presence of the indicia relied on in Zimmer may afford some evidence of a discriminatory purpose, satisfaction of those criteria is not of itself sufficient proof of such a purpose.  The so-calledZimmer criteria upon which the District Court and the Court of Appeals relied were most assuredly insufficient to prove an unconstitutionally discriminatory purpose in the present case.\n\n\n43\nFirst, the two courts found it highly significant that no Negro had been elected to the Mobile City Commission.  From this fact they concluded that the processes leading to nomination and election were not open equally to Negroes.  But the District Court's findings of fact, unquestioned on appeal, make clear that Negroes register and vote in Mobile \"without hindrance,\" and that there are no official obstacles in the way of Negroes who wish to become candidates for election to the Commission.  Indeed, it was undisputed that the only active \"slating\" organization in the city is comprised of Negroes.  It may be that Negro candidates have been defeated but that fact alone does not work a constitutional deprivation.  Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S., at 160, 91 S.Ct., at 1877;  see Arlington Heights, 429 U.S., at 266, and n. 15, 97 S.Ct., at 564 and n. 15.19\n\n\n44\nSecond, the District Court relied in part on its finding that the persons who were elected to the Commission discriminated against Negroes in municipal employment and in dispensing public services.  If that is the case, those discriminated against may be entitled to relief under the Constitution, albeit of a sort quite different from that sought in the present case.  The Equal Protection Clause proscribes purposeful discrimination because of race by any unit of state government, whatever the method of its election.  But evidence of discrimination by white officials in Mobile is relevant only as the most tenuous and circumstantial evidence of the constitutional invalidity of the electoral system under which they attained their offices.20\n\n\n45\nThird, the District Court and the Court of Appeals supported their conclusion by drawing upon the substantial history of official racial discrimination in Alabama.  But past discrimination cannot, in the manner of original sin, condemn governmental action that is not itself unlawful.  The ultimate question remains whether a discriminatory intent has been proved in a given case.  More distant instances of official discrimination in other cases are of limited help in resolving that question.\n\n\n46\nFinally, the District Court and the Court of Appeals pointed to the mechanics of the at-large electoral system itself as proof that the votes of Negroes were being invidiously canceled out. But those features of that electoral system, such as the majority vote requirement, tend naturally to disadvantage any voting minority, as we noted in White v. Regester, supra.  They are far from proof that the at-large electoral scheme represents purposeful discrimination against Negro voters.21\n\nB\n\n47\nWe turn finally to the arguments advanced in Part I of Mr. Justice MARSHALL's dissenting opinion.  The theory of this dissenting opinion\u2014a theory much more extreme than that espoused by the District Court or the Court of Appeals\u2014appears to be that every \"political group,\" or at least every such group that is in the minority, has a federal constitutional right to elect candidates in proportion to its numbers.22  Moreover, a political group's \"right\" to have its candidates elected is said to be a \"fundamental interest,\" the infringement of which may be established without proof that a State has acted with the purpose of impairing anybody's access to the political process.  This dissenting opinion finds the \"right\" infringed in the present case because no Negro has been elected to the Mobile City Commission.\n\n\n48\nWhatever appeal the dissenting opinion's view may have as a matter of political theory, it is not the law.  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require proportional representation as an imperative of political organization.  The entitlement that the dissenting opinion assumes to exist simply is not to be found in the Constitution of the United States.\n\n\n49\nIt is of course true that a law that impinges upon a fundamental right explicitly or implicitly secured by the Constitution is presumptively unconstitutional.  See Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 634, 638, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 1333, 22 L.Ed.2d 600, id., at 642-644, 89 S.Ct., at 1335-1336 (concurring opinion). See also San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 17, 30-32, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 1288, 1295-1296, 36 L.Ed.2d 16. But plainly \"[i]t is not the province of this court to create substantive constitutional rights in the name of guaranteeing equal protection of the laws,\" id., at 33, 93 S.Ct., at 1297.  See Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U.S. 56, 74, 92 S.Ct. 862, 874, 31 L.Ed.2d 36;  Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 485, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1161, 25 L.Ed.2d 491.  Accordingly, where a state law does not impair a right or liberty protected by the Constitution, there is no occasion to depart from \"the settled mode of constitutional analysis of legislat[ion]  . . .  involving questions of economic and social policy,\"  San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, supra, 411 U.S., at 33, 93 S.Ct., at 1296.23  Mr. Justice MARSHALL's dissenting opinion would discard these fixed principles in favor of a judicial inventiveness that would go \"far toward making this Court a 'super-legislature.' \"  Shapiro v. Thompson, supra, 394 U.S. at 655, 661, 89 S.Ct., at 1346 (Harlan, J., dissenting).  We are not free to do so.\n\n\n50\nMore than 100 years ago the Court unanimously held that \"the Constitution of the United States does not confer the right of suffrage upon any one.  . . .\"  Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162, 178, 22 L.Ed. 627.  See Lassiter v. Northampton Election Bd., 360 U.S., at 50-51, 79 S.Ct., at 989.  It is for the States \"to determine the conditions under which the right of suffrage may be exercised  . . ., absent of course the discrimination which the Constitution condemns,\" ibid.  It is true, as the dissenting opinion states, that the Equal Protection Clause confers a substantive right to participate in elections on an equal basis with other qualified voters.  See Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 336, 92 S.Ct. 995, 999, 31 L.Ed.2d 274;  Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S., at 576, 84 S.Ct., at 1389.  But this right to equal participation in the electoral process does not protect any \"political group,\" however defined, from electoral defeat.24\n\n\n51\nThe dissenting opinion erroneously discovers the asserted entitlement to group representation within the \"one person-one vote\" principle of Reynolds v. Sims, supra, and its progeny.25 Those cases established that the Equal Protection Clause guarantees the right of each voter to \"have his vote weighted equally with those of all other citizens.\"  377 U.S., at 576, 84 S.Ct., at 1389.  The Court recognized that a voter's right to \"have an equally effective voice\" in the election of representatives is impaired where representation is not apportioned substantially on a population basis.  In such cases, the votes of persons in more populous districts carry less weight than do those of persons in smaller districts.  There can be, of course, no claim that the \"one person, one vote\" principle has been violated in this case, because the city of Mobile is a unitary electoral district and the Commission elections are conducted at large.  It is therefore obvious that nobody's vote has been \"diluted\" in the sense in which that word was used in the Reynolds case.\n\n\n52\nThe dissenting opinion places an extraordinary interpretation on these decisions, an interpretation not justified by Reynolds v. Sims itself or by any other decision of this Court.  It is, of course, true that the right of a person to vote on an equal basis with other voters draws much of its significance from the political associations that its exercise reflects, but it is an altogether different matter to conclude that political groups themselves have an independent constitutional claim to representation.26  And the Court's decisions hold squarely that they do not.  See United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 166-167, 97 S.Ct. 996, 1010, 51 L.Ed.2d 229;  id., at 179-180, 97 S.Ct., at 1016-1017 (opinion concurring in judgment); White v. Regester, 412 U.S., at 765-766, 93 S.Ct., at 2339; Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S., at 149-150, 153-154, 156-157, 91 S.Ct., at 1872, 1873-1874, 1875-1876.\n\n\n53\nThe fact is that the Court has sternly set its face against the claim, however phrased, that the Constitution somehow guarantees proportional representation.  In Whitcomb v. Chavis, supra, the trial court had found that a multimember state legislative district had invidiously deprived Negroes and poor persons of rights guaranteed them by the Constitution, notwithstanding the absence of any evidence whatever of discrimination against them.  Reversing the trial court, this Court said:\n\n\n54\n\"The District Court's holding, although on the facts of      this case limited to guaranteeing one racial group      representation, is not easily contained.  It is expressive of      the more general proposition that any group with distinctive      interests must be represented in legislative halls if it is      numerous enough to command at least one seat and represents a majority living in an area sufficiently compact to      constitute a single-member district.  This approach would      make it difficult to reject claims of Democrats, Republicans,      or members of any political organization in Marion County who      live in what would be safe districts in a single-member      district system but who in one year or another, or year after      year, are submerged in a one-sided multi-member district      vote.  There are also union oriented workers, the university      community, religious or ethnic groups occupying identifiable      areas of our heterogeneous cities and urban areas.  Indeed,      it would be difficult for a great many, if not most,      multi-member districts to survive analysis under the District      Court's view unless combined with some voting arrangement      such as proportional representation or cumulative voting      aimed at providing representation for minority parties or      interests.  At the very least, affirmance of the District      Court would spawn endless litigation concerning the      multi-member district systems now widely employed in this      country.\"  Whitcomb v. Chavis, supra, at 156-157, 91 S.Ct.,      at 1876 (footnotes omitted).\n\nV\n\n55\nThe judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings.\n\n\n56\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n57\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN, concurring in the result.\n\n\n58\nAssuming that proof of intent is a prerequisite to appellees' prevailing on their constitutional claim of vote dilution, I am inclined to agree with Mr. Justice WHITE that, in this case, \"the findings of the District Court amply support an inference of purposeful discrimination,\" post, at 103. I concur in the Court's judgment of reversal, however, because I believe that the relief afforded appellees by the District Court was not commensurate with the sound exercise of judicial discretion.\n\n\n59\nIt seems to me that the city of Mobile, and its citizenry, have a substantial interest in maintaining the commission form of government that has been in effect there for nearly 70 years.  The District Court recognized that its remedial order, changing the form of the city's government to a mayor-council system, \"raised serious constitutional issues.\"  423 F.Supp. 384, 404 (SD Ala.1976).  Nonetheless, the court was \"unable to see how the impermissibly unconstitutional dilution can be effectively corrected by any other approach.\"  Id., at 403.\n\n\n60\nThe Court of Appeals approved the remedial measures adopted by the District Court and did so essentially on three factors: (1) this Court's preference for single-member districting in court-ordered legislative reapportionment, absent special circumstances, see, e. g., Connor v. Finch, 431 U.S. 407, 415, 97 S.Ct. 1828, 1834, 52 L.Ed.2d 465 (1977);  (2) appellants' noncooperation with the District Court's request for the submission of proposed municipal government plans that called for single-member districts for councilmen, under a mayor-council system of government;  and (3) the temporary nature of the relief afforded by the District Court, the city or State being free to adopt a \"constitutional replacement\" for the District Court's plan in the future.  571 F.2d 238, 247 (CA5 1978).\n\n\n61\nContrary to the Court of Appeals, I believe that special circumstances are presented when a District Court \"reapportions\" a municipal government by altering its basic structures.  See also the opinion of Mr. Justice STEWART, ante, at 70, and n. 15.  See Chapman v. Meier, 420 U.S. 1, 20, n. 14, 95 S.Ct. 751, 762, n. 14, 42 L.Ed.2d 766 (1975);  Sixty-Seventh Minnesota State Senate v. Beens, 406 U.S. 187, 92 S.Ct. 1477, 32 L.Ed.2d 1 (1972).  I also believe that the city's failure to submit a proposed plan to the District Court was excused by the fact that the only proposals the court was interested in receiving were variations on a mayor-council plan utilizing single-member districts.  Finally, although the District Court's order may have been temporary, it was unlikely that the courts below would have approved any attempt by Mobile to return to the commission form of government.  And even a temporary alteration of a long-established form of municipal government is a drastic measure for a court to take.\n\n\n62\nContrary to the District Court, I do not believe that, in order to remedy the unconstitutional vote dilution it found, it was necessary to convert Mobile's city government to a mayor-council system.  In my view, the District Court at least should have considered alternative remedial orders that would have maintained some of the basic elements of the commission system Mobile long ago had selected\u2014joint exercise of legislative and executive power, and citywide representation.  In the first place, I see no reason for the court to have separated legislative and executive power in the city of Mobile by creating the office of mayor.  In the second place, the court could have, and in my view should have, considered expanding the size of the Mobile City Commission and providing for the election of at least some commissioners at large.  Alternative plans might have retained at-large elections for all commissioners while imposing district residency requirements that would have insured the election of a commission that was a cross section of all of Mobile's neighborhoods, or a plurality-win system that would have provided the potential for the effective use of single-shot voting by black voters.  See City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S., at 184, n. 19, 100 S.Ct., at 1566, n. 19.  In failing to consider such alternative plans, it appears to me that the District Court was perhaps overly concerned with the elimination of at-large electionsper se, rather than with structuring an electoral system that provided an opportunity for black voters in Mobile to participate in the city's government on an equal footing with whites.\n\n\n63\nIn the past, this Court has emphasized that a district court's remedial power \"may be exercised only on the basis of a constitutional violation,\" and that \"the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy.\"  Swann v. Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 16, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1276, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971).  I am not convinced that any violation of federal constitutional rights established by appellees required the District Court to dismantle Mobile's commission form of government and replace it with a mayor-council system.  Accordingly, I, too, would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for reconsideration of an appropriate remedy.\n\n\n64\nMr. Justice STEVENS, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n65\nAt issue in this case is the constitutionality of the city of Mobile's commission form of government.  Black citizens in Mobile, who constitute a minority of that city's registered voters, challenged the at-large nature of the elections for the three positions of City Commissioner, contending that the system \"dilutes\" their votes in violation of the Fifteenth Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  While I agree with Mr. Justice STEWART that no violation of respondents' constitutional rights has been demonstrated, my analysis of the issue proceeds along somewhat different lines.\n\n\n66\nIn my view, there is a fundamental distinction between state action that inhibits an individual's right to vote and state action that affects the political strength of various groups that compete for leadership in a democratically governed community. That distinction divides so-called vote dilution practices into two different categories \"governed by entirely different constitutional considerations,\" see Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 58, 84 S.Ct. 603, 606, 11 L.Ed.2d 512 (Harlan, J., concurring).\n\n\n67\nIn the first category are practices such as poll taxes or literacy tests that deny individuals access to the ballot. Districting practices that make an individual's vote in a heavily populated district less significant than an individual's vote in a smaller district also belong in that category.  See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663;  Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506.1  Such practices must be tested by the strictest of constitutional standards, whether challenged under the Fifteenth Amendment or under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e. g., Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 337, 92 S.Ct. 995, 1000, 31 L.Ed.2d 274.\n\n\n68\nThis case does not fit within the first category.  The District Court found that black citizens in Mobile \"register and vote without hindrance\"2 and there is no claim that any individual's vote is worth less than any other's.  Rather, this case draws into question a political structure that treats all individuals as equals but adversely affects the political strength of a racially identifiable group.  Although I am satisfied that such a structure may be challenged under the Fifteenth Amendment as well as under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,3 I believe that under either provision it must be judged by a standard that allows the political process to function effectively.\n\n\n69\nMy conclusion that the Fifteenth Amendment applies to a case such as this rests on this Court's opinion in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110.  That case established that the Fifteenth Amendment does not simply guarantee the individual's right to vote;  it also limits the States' power to draw political boundaries.  Although Gomillion involved a districting structure that completely excluded the members of one race from participation in the city's elections,4 it does not stand for the proposition that no racial group can prevail on a Fifteenth Amendment claim unless it proves that an electoral system has the effect of making its members' right to vote, in Mr. Justice MARSHALL's words, \"nothing more than the right to cast meaningless ballots.\"  Post, 446 U.S., at 104, 100 S.Ct., at 1520. I agree with Mr. Justice MARSHALL that the Fifteenth Amendment need not and should not be so narrowly construed.  I do not agree, however, with his view that every \"showing of discriminatory impact\" on a historically and socially disadvantaged racial group, post, at 104, 111, n. 7, 100 S.Ct., at 1520, 1524, n. 7, is sufficient to invalidate a districting plan.5\n\n\n70\nNeither Gomillion nor any other case decided by this Court establishes a constitutional right to proportional representation for racial minorities.6  What Gomillion holds is that a sufficiently \"uncouth\" or irrational racial gerrymander violates the Fifteenth Amendment.  As Mr. Justice Whittaker's concurrence in that case demonstrates, the same result is compelled by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See 364 U.S., at 349, 81 S.Ct., at 131.  The fact that the \"gerrymander\" condemned in Gomillion was equally vulnerable under both Amendments indicates that the essential holding of that case is applicable, not merely to gerrymanders directed against racial minorities, but to those aimed at religious, ethnic, economic, and political groups as well.  Whatever the proper standard for identifying an unconstitutional gerrymander may be, I have long been persuaded that it must apply equally to all forms of political gerrymandering\u2014not just to racial gerrymandering.  See Cousins v. City Council of Chicago, 466 F.2d 830, 848-852 (CA7 1972) (Stevens, J., dissenting), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 893, 93 S.Ct. 85, 34 L.Ed.2d 151.7\n\n\n71\nThis conclusion follows, I believe, from the very nature of a gerrymander.  By definition, gerrymandering involves drawing district boundaries (or using multimember districts or at-large elections) in order to maximize the voting strength of those loyal to the dominant political faction and to minimize the strength of those opposed to it.8  466 F.2d, at 847.  In seeking the desired result, legislators necessarily make judgments about the probability that the members of certain identifiable groups, whether racial, ethnic, economic, or religious, will vote in the same way.  The success of the gerrymander from the legislators' point of view, as well as its impact on the disadvantaged group, depends on the accuracy of those predictions.\n\n\n72\nA prediction based on a racial characteristic is not necessarily more reliable than a prediction based on some other group characteristic.  Nor, since a legislator's ultimate purpose in making the prediction is political in character, is it necessarily more invidious or benign than a prediction based on other group characteristics.9  In the line-drawing process, racial, religious, ethnic, and economic gerrymanders are all species of political gerrymanders.\n\n\n73\nFrom the standpoint of the groups of voters that are affected by the line-drawing process, it is also important to recognize that it is the group's interest in gaining or maintaining political power that is at stake.  The mere fact that a number of citizens share a common ethnic, racial, or religious background does not create the need for protection against gerrymandering. It is only when their common interests are strong enough to be manifested in political action that the need arises.  For the political strength of a group is not a function of its ethnic, racial, or religious composition;  rather, it is a function of numbers\u2014specifically the number of persons who will vote in the same way.  In the long run there is no more certainty that individual members of racial groups will vote alike than that members of other identifiable groups will do so.  And surely there is no national interest in creating an incentive to define political groups by racial characteristics.10 But if the Constitution were interpreted to give more favorable treatment to a racial minority alleging an unconstitutional impairment of its political strength than it gives to other identifiable groups making the same claim such an incentive would inevitably result.\n\n\n74\nMy conclusion that the same standard should be applied to racial groups as is applied to other groups leads me also to conclude that the standard cannot condemn every adverse impact on one or more political groups without spawning more dilution litigation than the judiciary can manage.  Difficult as the issues engendered by Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663, may have been, nothing comparable to the mathematical yardstick used in apportionment cases is available to identify the difference between permissible and impermissible adverse impacts on the voting strength of political groups.\n\n\n75\nIn its prior cases the Court has phrased the standard as being whether the districting practices in question \"unconstitutionally operate to dilute or cancel the voting strength of racial or political elements.\"   Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 144, 91 S.Ct. 1858, 1869, 29 L.Ed.2d 363.  In Zimmer v. McKeithen, 485 F.2d 1297 (CA5 1973), aff'd on other grounds sub nom. East Carroll Parish School Bd. v. Marshall, 424 U.S. 636, 96 S.Ct. 1083, 47 L.Ed.2d 296, the Fifth Circuit attempted to outline the types of proof that would satisfy this rather amorphous test. Today, the plurality rejects the Zimmer analysis, holding that the primary, if not the sole, focus of the inquiry must be on the intent of the political body responsible for making the districting decision.  While I agree that the Zimmer analysis should be rejected, I do not believe that it is appropriate to focus on the subjective intent of the decisionmakers.\n\n\n76\nIn my view, the proper standard is suggested by three characteristics of the gerrymander condemned in Gomillion:  (1) the 28-sided configuration was, in the Court's word, \"uncouth,\" that is to say, it was manifestly not the product of a routine or a traditional political decision;  (2) it had a significant adverse impact on a minority group;  and (3) it was unsupported by any neutral justification and thus was either totally irrational or entirely motivated by a desire to curtail the political strength of the minority.  These characteristics suggest that a proper test should focus on the objective effects of the political decision rather than the subjective motivation of the decisionmaker.  See United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 384, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1683, 20 L.Ed.2d 672.11  In this case, if the commission form of government in Mobile were extraordinary, or if it were nothing more than a vestige of history, with no greater justification than the grotesque figure in Gomillion, it would surely violate the Constitution.  That conclusion would follow simply from its adverse impact on black voters plus the absence of any legitimate justification for the system, without reference to the subjective intent of the political body that has refused to alter it.\n\n\n77\nConversely, I am also persuaded that a political decision that affects group voting rights may be valid even if it can be proved that irrational or invidious factors have played some part in its enactment or retention.12  The standard for testing the acceptability of such a decision must take into account the fact that the responsibility for drawing political boundaries is generally committed to the legislative process and that the process inevitably involves a series of compromises among different group interests.  If the process is to work it must reflect an awareness of group interests and it must tolerate some attempts to advantage or to disadvantage particular segments of the voting populace.  Indeed, the same \"group interest\" may simultaneously support and oppose a particular boundary change.13 The standard cannot, therefore, be so strict that any evidence of a purpose to disadvantage a bloc of voters will justify a finding of \"invidious discrimination\"; otherwise, the facts of political life would deny legislatures the right to perform the districting function.  Accordingly, a political decision that is supported by valid and articulable justifications cannot be invalid simply because some participants in the decisionmaking process were motivated by a purpose to disadvantage a minority group.\n\n\n78\nThe decision to retain the commission form of government in Mobile, Ala., is such a decision.  I am persuaded that some support for its retention comes, directly or indirectly, from members of the white majority who are motivated by a desire to make it more difficult for members of the black minority to serve in positions of responsibility in city government.  I deplore that motivation and wish that neither it nor any other irrational prejudice played any part in our political processes.  But I do not believe otherwise legitimate political choices can be invalidated simply because an irrational or invidious purpose played some part in the decisionmaking process.\n\n\n79\nAs Mr. Justice STEWART points out, Mobile's basic election system is the same as that followed by literally thousands of municipalities and other governmental units throughout the Nation. Ante, at 60.14  The fact that these at-large systems characteristically place one or more minority groups at a significant disadvantage in the struggle for political power cannot invalidate all such systems.  See Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S., at 156-160, 91 S.Ct., at 1857-1877.  Nor can it be the law that such systems are valid when there is no evidence that they were instituted or maintained for discriminatory reasons, but that they may be selectively condemned on the basis of the subjective motivation or some of their supporters.  A contrary view \"would spawn endless litigation concerning the multi-member district systems now widely employed in this country,\" id., at 157, 91 S.Ct., at 1876, and would entangle the judiciary in a voracious political thicket.15\n\n\n80\nIn sum, I believe we must accept the choice to retain Mobile's commission form of government as constitutionally permissible even though that choice may well be the product of mixed motivation, some of which is invidious.  For these reasons I concur in the judgment of reversal.\n\n\n81\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, dissenting.\n\n\n82\nI dissent because I agree with Mr. Justice MARSHALL that proof of discriminatory impact is sufficient in these cases.  I also dissent because, even accepting the plurality's premise that discriminatory purpose must be shown, I agree with Mr. Justice MARSHALL and Mr. Justice WHITE that the appellees have clearly met that burden.\n\n\n83\nMr. Justice WHITE, dissenting.\n\n\n84\nIn White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973), this Court unanimously held the use of multimember districts for the election of state legislators in two counties in Texas violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because, based on a careful assessment of the totality of the circumstances, they were found to exclude Negroes and Mexican-Americans from effective participation in the political processes in the counties.  Without questioning the vitality of White v. Regester and our other decisions dealing with challenges to multimember districts by racial or ethnic groups, the Court today inexplicably rejects a similar holding based on meticulous factual findings and scrupulous application of the principles of these cases by both the District Court and the Court of Appeals. The Court's decision is flatly inconsistent with White v. Regester and it cannot be understood to flow from our recognition in Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976), that the Equal Protection Clause forbids only purposeful discrimination.  Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals properly found that an invidious discriminatory purpose could be inferred from the totality of facts in this case. The Court's cryptic rejection of their conclusions ignores the principles that an invidious discriminatory purpose can be inferred from objective factors of the kind relied on in White v. Regester and that the trial courts are in a special position to make such intensely local appraisals.\n\n\n85\n* Prior to our decision in White v. Regester, we upheld a number of multimember districting schemes against constitutional challenges, but we consistently recognized that such apportionment schemes could constitute invidious discrimination \"where the circumstances of a particular case may 'operate to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial or political elements of the voting population.' \"  Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 143, 91 S.Ct. 1858, 1869, 29 L.Ed.2d 363 (1971), quoting from Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433, 439, 85 S.Ct. 498, 501, 13 L.Ed.2d 401 (1965);  Burns v. Richardson, 384 U.S. 73, 88, 86 S.Ct. 1286, 1294, 16 L.Ed.2d 376 (1966).  In Whitcomb v. Chavis, supra, we noted that the fact that the number of members of a particular group who were legislators was not in proportion to the population of the group did not prove invidious discrimination absent evidence and findings that the members of the group had less opportunity than did other persons \"to participate in the political processes and to elect legislators of their choice.\" 403 U.S., at 149, 91 S.Ct., at 1872.\n\n\n86\nRelying on this principle, in White v. Regester we unanimously upheld a District Court's conclusion that the use of multimember districts in Dallas and Bexar Counties in Texas violated the Equal Protection Clause in the face of findings that they excluded Negroes and Mexican-Americans from effective participation in the political processes.  With respect to the exclusion of Negroes in Dallas County, \"the District Court first referred to the history of official racial discrimination in Texas, which at times touched the right of Negroes to register and vote and to participate in the democratic processes.\"  412 U.S., at 766, 93 S.Ct., at 2339.  The District Court also referred to Texas' majority vote requirement and \"place\" rule, \"neither in themselves improper nor invidious,\" but which \"enhanced the opportunity for racial discrimination\" by reducing legislative elections from the multimember district to \"a head-to-head contest for each position.\"  Ibid.  We deemed more fundamental the District Court's findings that only two Negro state representatives had been elected from Dallas County since Reconstruction and that these were the only two Negroes ever slated by an organization that effectively controlled Democratic Party candidate slating.  Id., at 766-767, 93 S.Ct., at 2339.  We also noted the District Court's findings that the Democratic Party slating organization was insensitive to the needs and aspirations of the Negro community and that at times it had employed racial campaign tactics to defeat candidates supported by the black community.  Based on this evidence, the District Court concluded that the black community generally was \"not permitted to enter into the political process in a reliable and meaningful manner.\" Id., at 767, 93 S.Ct., at 2340.  We held that \"[t]hese findings and conclusions are sufficient to sustain the District Court's judgment with respect to the Dallas multimember district and, on this record, we have no reason to disturb them.\"  Ibid.\n\n\n87\nWith respect to the exclusion of Mexican-Americans from the political process in Bexar County, the District Court referred to the continuing effects of a long history of invidious discrimination against Mexican-Americans in education, employment, economics, health, politics, and other fields.  Id., at 768, 93 S.Ct., at 2340.  The impact of this discrimination, coupled with a cultural and language barrier, made Mexican-American participation in the political life of Bexar County extremely difficult.  Only five Mexican-Americans had represented Bexar County in the Texas Legislature since 1880, and the county's legislative delegation \"was insufficiently responsive to Mexican-American interests.\" Id., at 769, 93 S.Ct., at 2341.  \"Based on the totality of the circumstances, the District Court evolved its ultimate assessment of the multimember district, overlaid, as it was, on the cultural and economic realities of the Mexican-American community in Bexar County and its relationship with the rest of the county.\"  Ibid.  \"[F]rom its own special vantage point\" the District Court concluded that the multimember district invidiously excluded Mexican-Americans from effective participation in the election of state representatives.  We affirmed, noting that we were \"not inclined to overturn these findings, representing as they do a blend of history and an intensely local appraisal of the design and impact of the Bexar County multimember district in the light of past and present reality, political and otherwise.\"  Id., at 769-770, 93 S.Ct., at 2341.\n\nII\n\n88\nIn the instant case the District Court and the Court of Appeals faithfully applied the principles of White v. Regester in assessing whether the maintenance of a system of at-large elections for the selection of Mobile City Commissioners denied Mobile Negroes their Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment rights. Scrupulously adhering to our admonition that \"[t]he plaintiffs' burden is to produce evidence to support findings that the political processes leading to nomination and election were not equally open to participation by the group in question,\" id., at 766, 93 S.Ct., at 2339, the District Court conducted a detailed factual inquiry into the openness of the candidate selection process to blacks.  The court noted that \"Mobile blacks were subjected to massive official and private racial discrimination until the Voting Rights Act of 1965\" and that \"[t]he pervasive effects of past discrimination still substantially affec[t] black political participation.\"  423 F.Supp. 384, 387 (SD Ala.1976). Although the District Court noted that \"[s]ince the Voting Rights Act of 1965, blacks register and vote without hindrance,\" the court found that \"local political processes are not equally open\" to blacks.  Despite the fact that Negroes constitute more than 35% of the population of Mobile, no Negro has ever been elected to the Mobile City Commission.  The plaintiffs introduced extensive evidence of severe racial polarization in voting patterns during the 1960's and 1970's with \"white voting for white and black for black if a white is opposed to a black,\" resulting in the defeat of the black candidate or, if two whites are running, the defeat of the white candidate most identified with blacks.  Id., at 388.  Regression analyses covering every City Commission race in 1965, 1969, and 1973, both the primary and general election of the county commission in 1968 and 1972, selected school board races in 1962, 1966, 1970, 1972, and 1974, city referendums in 1963 and 1973, and a countywide legislative race in 1969 confirmed the existence of severe bloc voting.  Id., at 388-389.  Nearly every active candidate for public office testified that because of racial polarization \"it is highly unlikely that anytime in the foreseeable future, under the at-large system, . . . a black can be elected against a white.\"  Id., at 388.  After single-member districts were created in Mobile County for state legislative elections, \"three blacks of the present fourteen member Mobile County delegation have been elected.\"  Id., at 389.  Based on the foregoing evidence, the District Court found \"that the structure of the at-large election of city commissioners combined with strong racial polarization of Mobile's electorate continues to effectively discourage qualified black citizens from seeking office or being elected thereby denying blacks equal access to the slating or candidate selection process.\"  Ibid.\n\n\n89\nThe District Court also reviewed extensive evidence that the City Commissioners elected under the at-large system have not been responsive to the needs of the Negro community.  The court found that city officials have been unresponsive to the interests of Mobile Negroes in municipal employment, appointments to boards and committees, and the provision of municipal services in part because of \"the political fear of a white backlash vote when black citizens' needs are at stake.\"  Id., at 392.  The court also found that there is no clear-cut state policy preference for at-large elections and that past discrimination affecting the ability of Negroes to register and to vote \"has helped preclude the effective participation of blacks in the election system today.\"  Id., at 393.  The adverse impact of the at-large election system on minorities was found to be enhanced by the large size of the citywide election district, the majority vote requirement, the provision that candidates run for positions by place or number, and the lack of any provision for at-large candidates to run from particular geographical subdistricts.\n\n\n90\nAfter concluding its extensive findings of fact, the District Court addressed the question of the effect of Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976), on the White v. Regester standards.  The court concluded that the requirement that a facially neutral statute involve purposeful discrimination before a violation of the Equal Protection Clause can be established was not inconsistent with White v. Regester in light of the recognition in Washington v. Davis, supra, at 241-242, 96 S.Ct., at 2048, that the discriminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of the relevant facts, including the discriminatory impact of the statute.  423 F.Supp., at 398.  After noting that \"whenever a redistricting bill of any type is proposed by a county delegation member, a major concern has centered around how many, if any, blacks would be elected,\" id., at 397, the District Court concluded that there was \"a present purpose to dilute the black vote  . . .  RESULTING FROM INTENTIONAL STATE LEGISLATIVE INACTION  . . . .\"  ID., at 398.  Based on an \"exhaustive analysis of the evidence in the record,\" the court held that \"[t]he plaintiffs have met the burden cast in White and Whitcomb,\" and that \"the multi-member at-large election of Mobile City Commissioners  . . .  results in an unconstitutional dilution of black voting strength.\"  Id., at 402.\n\n\n91\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's judgment in one of four consolidated \"dilution\" cases decided on the same day.  Bolden v. Mobile, 571 F.2d 238 (CA5 1978);  Nevett v. Sides, 571 F.2d 209 (CA5 1978) (Nevett II );  Blacks United for Lasting Leadership, Inc. v. Shreveport, 571 F.2d 248 (CA5 1978);  Thomasville Branch of NAACP v. Thomas County, Georgia, 571 F.2d 257 (CA5 1978).  In the lead case of Nevett II, supra, the Court of Appeals held that under Washington v. Davis, supra, and Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977), \"a showing of racially motivated discrimination is a necessary element\" for a successful claim of unconstitutional voting dilution under either the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment.  571 F.2d, at 219.  The court concluded that the standards for proving unconstitutional voting dilution, outlined in White v. Regester were consistent with the requirement that purposeful discrimination be shown because they focus on factors that go beyond a simple showing that minorities are not represented in proportion to their numbers in the general population.  571 F.2d, at 219-220, n. 13, 222-224.\n\n\n92\nIn its decision in the instant case the Court of Appeals reviewed the District Court's findings of fact, found them not to be clearly erroneous and held that they \"compel the inference that [Mobile's at-large] system has been maintained with the purpose of diluting the black vote, thus supplying the element of intent necessary to establish a violation of the fourteenth amendment, Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252 [97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450] (1977); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 [96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597] (1976), and the fifteenth amendment, Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52 [84 S.Ct. 603, 11 L.Ed.2d 512] (1964).\"  Id., at 245.  The court observed that the District Court's \"finding that the legislature was acutely conscious of the racial consequences of its districting policies,\" coupled with the attempt to assign different functions to each of the three City Commissioners \"to lock in the at-large feature of the scheme,\" constituted \"direct evidence of the intent behind the maintenance of the at-large plan.\"  Id., at 246.  The Court of Appeals concluded that \"the district court has properly conducted the 'sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available' that a court must undertake in '[d]etermining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor' in the maintenance or enactment of a districting plan.\"  Ibid., quoting Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., supra, at 266, 97 S.Ct., at 2060.\n\nIII\n\n93\nA plurality of the Court today agrees with the courts below that maintenance of Mobile's at-large system for election of City Commissioners violates the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments only if it is motivated by a racially discriminatory purpose.  The plurality also apparently reaffirms the vitality of White v. Regester and Whitcomb v. Chavis, which established the standards for determining whether at-large election systems are unconstitutionally discriminatory.  The plurality nonetheless casts aside the meticulous application of the principles of these cases by both the District Court and the Court of Appeals by concluding that the evidence they relied upon \"fell far short of showing\" purposeful discrimination.\n\n\n94\nThe plurality erroneously suggests that the District Court erred by considering the factors articulated by the Court of Appeals in Zimmer v. McKeithen, 485 F.2d 1297 (CA5 1973), to determine whether purposeful discrimination has been shown.  This remarkable suggestion ignores the facts that Zimmer articulated the very factors deemed relevant by White v. Regester and Whitcomb v. Chavis \u2014a lack of minority access to the candidate selection process, unresponsiveness of elected officials to minority interests, a history of discrimination, majority vote requirements, provisions that candidates run for positions by place or number, the lack of any provision for at-large candidates to run from particular geographical subdistricts\u2014and that both the District Court and the Court of Appeals considered these factors with the recognition that they are relevant only with respect to the question whether purposeful discrimination can be inferred.\n\n\n95\nAlthough the plurality does acknowledge that \"the presence of the indicia relied on in Zimmer may afford some evidence of a discriminatory purpose,\" it concludes that the evidence relied upon by the court below was \"most assuredly insufficient to prove an unconstitutionally discriminatory purpose in the present case.\"  The plurality apparently bases this conclusion on the fact that there are no official obstacles barring Negroes from registering, voting, and running for office, coupled with its conclusion that none of the factors relied upon by the courts below would alone be sufficient to support an inference of purposeful discrimination.  The absence of official obstacles to registration, voting, and running for office heretofore has never been deemed to insulate an electoral system from attack under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.  In White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973), there was no evidence that Negroes faced official obstacles to registration, voting, and running for office, yet we upheld a finding that they had been excluded from effective participation in the political process in violation of the Equal Protection Clause because a multimember districting scheme, in the context of racial voting at the polls, was being used invidiously to prevent Negroes from being elected to public office.  In Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110 (1960), and Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461, 73 S.Ct. 809, 97 L.Ed. 1152 (1953), we invalidated electoral systems under the Fifteen Amendment not because they erected official obstacles in the path of Negroes registering, voting, or running for office, but because they were used effectively to deprive the Negro vote of any value.  Thus, even though Mobile's Negro community may register and vote without hindrance, the system of at-large election of City Commissioners may violate the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments if it is used purposefully to exclude Negroes from the political process.\n\n\n96\nIn conducting \"an intensely local appraisal of the design and impact\" of the at-large election scheme, White v. Regester, supra, at 769, 93 S.Ct., at 2341, the District Court's decision was fully consistent with our recognition in Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S., at 242, 96 S.Ct., at 2048-49, that \"an invidious discriminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of the relevant facts, including the fact, if it is true, that the law bears more heavily on one race than another.\"  Although the totality of the facts relied upon by the District Court to support its inference of purposeful discrimination is even more compelling than that present in White v. Regester, the plurality today rejects the inference of purposeful discrimination apparently because each of the factors relied upon by the courts below is alone insufficient to support the inference.  The plurality states that the \"fact [that Negro candidates have been defeated] alone does not work a constitutional deprivation,\" that evidence of the unresponsiveness of elected officials \"is relevant only as the most tenuous and circumstantial evidence,\" that \"the substantial history of official racial discrimination  . . .  [is] of limited help,\" and that the features of the electoral system that enhance the disadvantages faced by a voting minority \"are far from proof that the at-large electoral scheme represents purposeful discrimination.\"  By viewing each of the factors relied upon below in isolation, and ignoring the fact that racial bloc voting at the polls makes it impossible to elect a black commissioner under the at-large system, the plurality rejects the \"totality of the circumstances\" approach we endorsed in White v. Regester, supra, at 766-770, 93 S.Ct., at 2339-2341;  Washington v. Davis, supra, at 241-242, 96 S.Ct., at 2048-2049, and Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S., at 266, 97 S.Ct., at 563, and leaves the courts below adrift on uncharted seas with respect to how to proceed on remand.\n\n\n97\nBecause I believe that the findings of the District Court amply support an inference of purposeful discrimination in violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n98\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, dissenting.\n\n\n99\nThe American ideal of political equality, conceived in the earliest days of our colonial existence and fostered by the egalitarian language of the Declaration of Independence, could not forever tolerate the limitation of the right to vote to white propertied males.  Our Constitution has been amended six times in the movement toward a democracy for more than the few,1 and this Court has interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment to provide that \"a citizen has a constitutionally protected right to participate in elections on an equal basis with other citizens in the jurisdiction,\" Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 336, 92 S.Ct. 995, 1000, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972).  The Court's decision today is in a different spirit.  Indeed, a plurality of the Court concludes that, in the absence of proof of intentional discrimination by the State, the right to vote provides the politically powerless with nothing more than the right to cast meaningless ballots.\n\n\n100\nThe District Court in both of these cases found that the challenged multimember districting schemes unconstitutionally diluted the Negro vote.  These factual findings were upheld by the Court of Appeals, and the plurality does not question them. Instead, the plurality concludes that districting schemes do not violate the Equal Protection Clause unless it is proved that they were enacted or maintained for the purpose of minimizing or canceling out the voting potential of a racial minority.  The plurality would require plaintiffs in vote-dilution cases to meet the stringent burden of establishing discriminatory intent within the meaning of Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976);  Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977); and Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 60 L.Ed.2d 870 (1979).  In my view, our vote-dilution decisions require only a showing of discriminatory impact to justify the invalidation of a multimember districting scheme, and, because they are premised on the fundamental interest in voting protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, the discriminatory-impact standard adopted by them is unaffected by Washington v. Davis, supra, and its progeny.  Furthermore, an intent requirement is inconsistent with the protection against denial or abridgment of the vote on account of race embodied in the Fifteenth Amendment and in \u00a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 437, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973.2  Even if, however, proof of discriminatory intent were necessary to support a vote-dilution claim, I would impose upon the plaintiffs a standard of proof less rigid than that provided by Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, supra.\n\n\n101\n* The Court does not dispute the proposition that multimember districting can have the effect of submerging electoral minorities and overrepresenting electoral majorities.3  It is for this reason that we developed a strong preference for single-member districting in court-ordered reapportionment plans. See ante, at 66, n. 12, 100 S.Ct. at 1499, n. 12.  Furthermore, and more important for present purposes, we decided a series of vote-dilution cases under the Fourteenth Amendment that were designed to protect electoral minorities from precisely the combination of electoral laws and historical and social factors found in the present cases.4  In my view, the plurality's treatment of these cases is fanciful.  Although we have held that multimember districts are not unconstitutional per se, see ante, at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 1499, there is simply no basis for the plurality's conclusion that under our prior cases proof of discriminatory intent is a necessary condition for the invalidation of multimember districting.\n\n\n102\nIn Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433, 85 S.Ct. 498, 13 L.Ed.2d 401 (1965), the first vote-dilution case to reach this Court, we stated explicitly that such a claim could rest on either discriminatory purpose or effect:\n\n\n103\n\"It might well be that, designedly or otherwise, a      multi-member constituency apportionment scheme, under the      circumstances of a particular case, would operate to minimize      or cancel out the voting strength of racial or political      elements of the voting population.\"  Id., at 439, 85 S.Ct.,      at 501 (emphasis added).\n\n\n104\nWe reiterated these words in Burns v. Richardson, 384 U.S. 73, 86 S.Ct. 1286, 16 L.Ed.2d 376 (1966), interpreted them as the correct test to apply to vote-dilution claims, and described the standard as one involving \"invidious effect,\" id., at 88, 86 S.Ct., at 1294.  We then held that the plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden of proof:\n\n\n105\n\"[T]he demonstration that a particular multi-member scheme      effects an invidious result must appear from evidence in the      record.  . . .  That demonstration was not made here.  In      relying on conjecture as to the effects of multi-member      districting rather than demonstrated fact, the court acted in      a manner more appropriate to the body responsible for drawing      up the districting plan.  Speculations do not supply evidence      that the multi-member districting was designed to have or had      the invidious effect necessary to a judgment of the      unconstitutionality of the districting.\"  Id., at 88-89, 86      S.Ct., at 1294-1295 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).\n\n\n106\nIt could not be plainer that the Court in Burns considered discriminatory effect a sufficient condition for invalidating a multimember districting plan.\n\n\n107\nIn Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 91 S.Ct. 1858, 29 L.Ed.2d 363 (1971), we again repeated and applied the Fortson standard, 403 U.S., at 143, 144, 91 S.Ct., at 1869, but determined that the Negro community's lack of success at the polls was the result of partisan politics, not racial vote dilution.  Id., at 150-155, 91 S.Ct., at 1872-1875.  The Court stressed that both the Democratic and Republican Parties had nominated Negroes, and several had been elected.  Negro candidates lost only when their entire party slate went down to defeat.  Id., at 150, nn. 29-30, 91 S.Ct., at 1872, nn. 29-30, 152-153, 91 S.Ct., at 1873.  In addition, the Court was impressed that there was no finding that officials had been unresponsive to Negro concerns.  Id., at 152, n. 32, 155, 91 S.Ct., at 1875, n. 32.5\n\n\n108\nMore recently, in White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973), we invalidated the challenged multimember districting plans because their characteristics, when combined with historical and social factors, had the discriminatory effect of denying the plaintiff Negroes and Mexican-Americans equal access to the political process.  Id., at 765-770, 93 S.Ct., at 2339-2341.  We stated that\n\n\n109\n\"it is not enough that the racial group allegedly      discriminated against has not had legislative seats in      proportion to its voting potential.  The plaintiffs' burden      is to produce evidence to support findings that the political      processes leading to nomination and election were not equally      open to participation by the group in question\u2014that its      members had less opportunity than did other residents in the      district to participate in the political processes and to      elect legislators of their choice.\"  Id., at 765-766, 93      S.Ct., at 2339.\n\n\n110\nWe held that the three-judge District Court had properly applied this standard in invalidating the multimember districting schemes in the Texas counties of Dallas and Bexar.  The District Court had determined that the characteristics of the challenged electoral systems\u2014multimember districts, a majority-vote requirement for nomination in a primary election, and a rule mandating that a candidate running for a position in a multimember district must run for a specified \"place\" on the ticket\u2014though \"neither in themselves improper nor invidious,\" reduced the electoral influence of Negroes and Mexican-Americans.   Id., at 766, 93 S.Ct., at 2340.6  The District Court identified a number of social and historical factors that, when combined with the Texas electoral structure, resulted in vote dilution:  (1) a history of official racial discrimination in Texas, including discrimination inhibiting the registration, casting of ballots, and political participation of Negroes;  (2) proof that minorities were still suffering the effects of past discrimination;  (3) a history of gross underrepresentation of minority interests;  (4) proof of official insensitivity to the needs of minority citizens, whose votes were not needed by those in power;  (5) the recent use of racial campaign tactics;  and (6) a cultural and language barrier inhibiting the participation of Mexican-Americans.  Id., at 766-770, 93 S.Ct., at 2339-2341. Based \"on the totality of the circumstances,\" we affirmed the District Court's conclusion that the use of multimember districts excluded the plaintiffs \"from effective participation in political life.\"  Id., at 769, 93 S.Ct., at 2341.7\n\n\n111\nIt is apparent that a showing of discriminatory intent in the creation or maintenance of multimember districts is as unnecessary after White as it was under our earlier vote-dilution decisions. Under this line of cases, an electoral districting plan is invalid if it has the effect of affording an electoral minority \"less opportunity than  . . .  other residents in the district to participate in the political processes and to elect legislators of their choice,\" id., at 766, 93 S.Ct., at 2339.  It is also apparent that the Court in White considered equal access to the political process as meaning more than merely allowing the minority the opportunity to vote.  White stands for the proposition that an electoral system may not relegate an electoral minority to political impotence by diminishing the importance of its vote.  The plurality's approach requiring proof of discriminatory purpose in the present cases is, then, squarely contrary to White and its predecessors.8\n\nB\n\n112\nThe plurality fails to apply the discriminatory-effect standard of White v. Regester because that approach conflicts with what the plurality takes to be an elementary principle of law. \"[O]nly if there is purposeful discrimination,\" announces the plurality, \"can there be a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"  Ante, at 66, 100 S.Ct., at 1499.  That proposition is plainly overbroad.  It fails to distinguish between two distinct lines of equal protection decisions:  those involving suspect classifications, and those involving fundamental rights.\n\n\n113\nWe have long recognized that under the Equal Protection Clause classifications based on race are \"constitutionally suspect,\" Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499, 74 S.Ct. 693, 694, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954), and are subject to the \"most rigid scrutiny,\" Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214, 216, 65 S.Ct. 193, 194, 89 L.Ed. 194 (1944), regardless of whether they infringe on an independently protected constitutional right.  Cf. University of California Regents v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978).  Under Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976), a showing of discriminatory purpose is necessary to impose strict scrutiny on facially neutral classifications having a racially discriminatory impact.  Perhaps because the plaintiffs in the present cases are Negro, the plurality assumes that their vote-dilution claims are premised on the suspect-classification branch of our equal protection cases, and that under Washington v. Davis, supra, they are required to prove discriminatory intent.  That assumption fails to recognize that our vote-dilution decisions are rooted in a different strand of equal protection jurisprudence.\n\n\n114\nUnder the Equal Protection Clause, if a classification \"impinges upon a fundamental right explicitly or implicitly protected by the Constitution,  . . .  strict judicial scrutiny\" is required, San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 17, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973), regardless of whether the infringement was intentional.9  As I will explain, our cases recognize a fundamental right to equal electoral participation that encompasses protection against vote dilution.  Proof of discriminatory purpose is, therefore, not required to support a claim of vote dilution.10  The plurality's erroneous conclusion to the contrary is the result of a failure to recognize the central distinction between White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973), and Washington v. Davis, supra :  the former involved an infringement of a constitutionally protected right, while the latter dealt with a claim of racially discriminatory distribution of an interest to which no citizen has a constitutional entitlement.11\n\n\n115\nNearly a century ago, the Court recognized the elementary proposition upon which our structure of civil rights is based: \"[T]he political franchise of voting is  . . .  a fundamental political right, because preservative of all rights.\"  Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 1071, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886).  We reiterated that theme in our landmark decision in Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 561-562, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1381, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964), and stated that, because \"the right of suffrage is a fundamental matter in a free and democratic society[,]  . . .  any alleged infringement of the right of citizens to vote must be carefully and meticulously scrutinized.\" Ibid.  We realized that \"the right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen's vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.\"   Id., at 555, 84 S.Ct., at 1378.  Accordingly, we recognized that the Equal Protection Clause protects \"[t]he right of a citizen to equal representation and to have his vote weighted equally with those of all other citizens.\"   Id., at 576, 84 S.Ct., at 1389.  See also  Wes \u00a2s\u00a2s116\u00a2s v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 17, 84 S.Ct. 526, 534, 11 L.Ed.2d 481 (1964);  Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368, 379-380, 83 S.Ct. 801, 807-808, 9 L.Ed.2d 821 (1963).12\n\n\n116\nReynolds v. Sims and its progeny13 focused solely on the discriminatory effects of malapportionment.  They recognize that, when population figures for the representational districts of a legislature are not similar, the votes of citizens in larger districts do not carry as much weight in the legislature as do votes cast by citizens in smaller districts.  The equal protection problem attacked by the \"one person, one vote\" principle is, then, one of vote dilution:  under Reynolds, each citizen must have an \"equally effective voice\" in the election of representatives. Reynolds v. Sims, supra, 377 U.S., at 565, 84 S.Ct., at 1383.  In the present cases, the alleged vote dilution, though caused by the combined effects of the electoral structure and social and historical factors rather than by unequal population distribution, is analytically the same concept:  the unjustified abridgment of a fundamental right.14  It follows, then, that a showing of discriminatory intent is just as unnecessary under the vote-dilution approach adopted in Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433, 85 S.Ct. 498, 13 L.Ed.2d 1401 (1965), and applied in White v. Regester, supra, as it is under our reapportionment cases.15\n\n\n117\nIndeed, our vote-dilution cases have explicitly acknowledged that they are premised on the infringement of a fundamental right, not on the Equal Protection Clause's prohibition of racial discrimination.  Our first vote-dilution decision, Fortson v. Dorsey, supra, involved a 1962 Georgia reapportionment statute that allocated the 54 seats of the Georgia Senate among the State's 159 counties.  Thirty-three of the senatorial districts were made up of from one to eight counties each, and were single-member districts.  The remaining 21 districts were allotted among the 7 most populous counties, with each county containing at least 2 districts and electing all of its senators by countywide vote.  The plaintiffs, who were registered voters residing in two of the multidistrict counties,16 argued that the apportionment plan on its face violated the Equal Protection Clause because countywide voting in the seven multidistrict counties denied their residents a vote equal to that of voters residing in single-member constituencies.S17  We were unconvinced that the plan operated to dilute any Georgian's vote, and therefore upheld the facial validity of the scheme.  We cautioned, however, that the Equal Protection Clause would not tolerate a multimember districting plan that \"designedly or otherwise,  . . .  operate[d] to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial or political elements of the voting population.\"  379 U.S., at 439, 85 S.Ct., at 501 (emphasis added).\n\n\n118\nThe approach to vote dilution adopted in Fortson plainly consisted of a fundamental-rights analysis.  If the Court had believed that the equal protection problem with alleged vote dilution was one of racial discrimination and not abridgment of the right to vote, it would not have accorded standing to the plaintiffs, who were simply registered voters of Georgia alleging that the state apportionment plan, as a theoretical matter, diluted their voting strength because of where they lived.  To the contrary, we did not question their standing, and held against them solely because we found unpersuasive their claim on the merits.  The Court did not reach this result by inadvertence; rather, we explicitly recognized that we had adopted a fundamental-rights approach when we stated that the Equal Protection Clause protected the voting strength of political as well as racial groups.\n\n\n119\nUntil today, this Court had never deviated from this principle.  We reiterated that our vote-dilution doctrine protects political groups in addition to racial groups in Burns v. Richardson, 384 U.S., at 88, 86 S.Ct., at 1294, where we allowed a general class of qualified voters to assert such a vote-dilution claim.  In Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 91 S.Ct. 1858, 29 L.Ed.2d 363 (1971), we again explicitly recognized that political groups could raise such claims, id., at 143, 144, 91 S.Ct., at 1869.  In White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973), the plaintiffs were Negroes and Mexican-Americans, and accordingly the Court had no reason to discuss whether non-minority plaintiffs could assert claims of vote dilution.18  In a companion case to White, however, we again recognized that \"political elements\" were protected against vote dilution.  Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U.S. 735, 751, 93 S.Ct. 2321, 2330, 37 L.Ed.2d 298 (1973).  Two years later, in Dallas County v. Reese, 421 U.S. 477, 95 S.Ct. 1706, 44 L.Ed.2d 312 (1975) (per curiam ), we accorded standing to urban dwellers alleging vote dilution as to the election of the county commission and stated that multimember districting is unconstitutional if it \"in fact operates impermissibly to dilute the voting strength of an identifiable element of the voting population.\"  Id., at 480, 95 S.Ct., at 1708 (emphasis added). And in United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 97 S.Ct. 996, 51 L.Ed.2d 229 (1977), the plurality opinion of Mr. Justice WHITE stated that districting plans were subject to attack if they diluted the vote of \"racial or political groups.\"  Id., at 167, 97 S.Ct., at 1010 (emphasis in original).19\n\n\n120\nOur vote-dilution decisions, then, involve the fundamental-interest branch, rather than the antidiscrimination branch, of our jurisprudence under the Equal Protection Clause. They recognize a substantive constitutional right to participate on an equal basis in the electoral process that cannot be denied or diminished for any reason, racial or otherwise, lacking quite substantial justification.  They are premised on a rationale wholly apart from that underlying Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976).  That decision involved application of a different equal protection principle, the prohibition on racial discrimination in the governmental distribution of interests to which citizens have no constitutional entitlement.20  Whatever may be the merits of applying motivational analysis to the allocation of constitutionally gratuitous benefits, that approach is completely misplaced where, as here, it is applied to the distribution of a constitutionally protected interest.21\n\n\n121\nWashington v. Davis, then, in no way alters the discriminatory-impact test developed in Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433, 85 S.Ct. 498, 13 L.Ed.2d 401 (1965), and applied in White v. Regester, supra, to evaluate claims of dilution of the fundamental right to vote.  In my view, that test is now, and always has been, the proper method of safeguarding against inequitable distribution of political influence.\n\n\n122\nThe plurality's response is that my approach amounts to nothing less than a constitutional requirement of proportional representation for groups.  See ante, at 75-80, 100 S.Ct., at 1504-1507.  That assertion amounts to nothing more than a red herring:  I explicitly reject the notion that the Constitution contains any such requirement.  See n. 7, supra.  The constitutional protection against vote dilution found in our prior cases does not extend to those situations in which a group has merely failed to elect representatives in proportion to its share of the population.  To prove unconstitutional vote dilution, the group is also required to carry the far more onerous burden of demonstrating that it has been effectively fenced out of the political process.  See ibid.  Typical of the plurality's mischaracterization of my position is its assertion that I would provide protection against vote dilution for \"every 'political group,' or at least every such group that is in the minority.\" Ante, at 75, 100 S.Ct., at 1504.  The vote-dilution doctrine can logically apply only to groups whose electoral discreteness and insularity allow dominant political factions to ignore them.  See nn. 7 and 19, supra.  In short, the distinction between a requirement of proportional representation and the discriminatory-effect test I espouse is by no means a difficult one, and it is hard for me to understand why the plurality insists on ignoring it.\n\n\n123\nThe plaintiffs in No. 77-1844 proved that no Negro had ever been elected to the Mobile City Commission, despite the fact that Negroes constitute about one-third of the electorate, and that the persistence of severe racial bloc voting made it highly unlikely that any Negro could be elected at large in the foreseeable future.  423 F.Supp. 384, 387-389 (SD Ala.1976). Contrary to the plurality's contention, see ante, at 75-76, 100 S.Ct., at 1504, however, I do not find unconstitutional vote dilution in this case simply because of that showing.  The plaintiffs convinced the District Court that Mobile Negroes were unable to use alternative avenues of political influence.  They showed that Mobile Negroes still suffered pervasive present effects of massive historical, official and private discrimination, and that the City Commission had been quite unresponsive to the needs of the minority community.  The City of Mobile has been guilty of such pervasive racial discrimination in hiring employees that extensive intervention by the Federal District Court has been required.  423 F.Supp., at 389, 400. Negroes are grossly underrepresented on city boards and committees.  Id., at 389-390.  The city's distribution of public services is racially discriminatory.  Id., at 390-391.  City officials and police were largely unmoved by Negro complaints about police brutality and a \"mock lynching.\"  Id., at 392.  The District Court concluded that \"[t]his sluggish and timid response is another manifestation of the low priority given to the needs of the black citizens and of the [commissioners'] political fear of a white backlash vote when black citizens' needs are at stake.\" Ibid.  See also the dissenting opinion of my Brother WHITE, ante, p. 94, 100 S.Ct., p. 1514.\n\n\n124\nA requirement of proportional representation would indeed transform this Court into a \"super-legislature,\" ante, at 76, 100 S.Ct., at 1505, and would create the risk that some groups would receive an undeserved windfall of political influence.  In contrast, the protection against vote dilution recognized by our prior cases serves as a minimally intrusive guarantee of political survival for a discrete political minority that is effectively locked out of governmental decisionmaking processes.22  So understood, the doctrine hardly \" 'create[s] substantive constitutional rights in the name of guaranteeing equal protection of the laws,' \" ibid., p. 76, 100 S.Ct., at 1504, quoting San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S., at 33, 93 S.Ct., at 1296.  Rather, the doctrine is a simple reflection of the basic principle that the Equal Protection Clause protects \"[t]he right of a citizen to equal representation and to have his vote weighted equally with those of all other citizens.\"  Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S., at 576, 84 S.Ct., at 1389.23\n\nII\n\n125\nSection 1 of the Fifteenth Amendment provides:\n\n\n126\n\"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not      be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on      account of race, color or previous condition of servitude.\"\n\n\n127\nToday the plurality gives short shrift to the argument that proof of discriminatory intent is not a necessary condition to relief under this Amendment.  See ante, at 61-65, 100 S.Ct., at 1497-1499.24  I have examined this issue in another context and reached the contrary result.   Beer v. United States, 425 U.S. 130, 146-149, and nn. 3-5, 96 S.Ct. 1357, 1366, 1367, and nn. 3-5, 47 L.Ed.2d 629 (1976) (dissenting opinion).  I continue to believe that \"a showing of purpose or of effect is alone sufficient to demonstrate unconstitutionality,\" id., at 149, n. 5, 96 S.Ct., at 1368, n. 5 and wish to explicate further why I find this standard appropriate for Fifteenth Amendment claims.  First, however, it is necessary to address the plurality's apparent suggestion that the Fifteenth Amendment protects against only denial, and not dilution, of the vote.25\n\n\n128\nThe Fifteenth Amendment does not confer an absolute right to vote.  See ante, at 62, 100 S.Ct., at 1497.  By providing that the right to vote cannot be discriminatorily \"denied or abridged,\" however, the Amendment assuredly strikes down the diminution as well as the outright denial of the exercise of the franchise.  An interpretation holding that the Amendment reaches only complete abrogation of the vote would render the Amendment essentially useless, since it is no difficult task to imagine schemes in which the Negro's marking of the ballot is a meaningless exercise.\n\n\n129\nThe Court has long understood that the right to vote encompasses protection against vote dilution.  \"[T]he right to have one's vote counted\" is of the same importance as \"the right to put a ballot in a box.\"  United States v. Mosley, 238 U.S. 383, 386, 35 S.Ct. 904, 905, 59 L.Ed. 1355 (1915).  See United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 85 L.Ed. 1368 (1941); Swafford v. Templeton, 185 U.S. 487, 22 S.Ct. 783, 46 L.Ed. 1005 (1902);  Wiley v. Sinkler, 179 U.S. 58, 21 S.Ct. 17, 45 L.Ed. 84 (1900);  Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651, 4 S.Ct. 152, 28 L.Ed. 274 (1884).  The right to vote is protected against the diluting effect of ballot-box stuffing.  United States v. Saylor, 322 U.S. 385, 64 S.Ct. 1101, 88 L.Ed. 1341 (1944);  Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 25 L.Ed. 717 (1880).  Indeed, this Court has explicitly recognized that the Fifteenth Amendment protects against vote dilution.  In Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461, 73 S.Ct. 809, 97 L.Ed. 1152 (1953), and Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649, 64 S.Ct. 757, 88 L.Ed. 987 (1944), the Negro plaintiffs did not question their access to the ballot for general elections. Instead they argued, and the Court recognized, that the value of their votes had been diluted by their exclusion from participation in primary elections and in the slating of candidates by political parties.  The Court's struggles with the concept of \"state action\" in those decisions were necessarily premised on the understanding that vote dilution was a claim cognizable under the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\n\n130\nWright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 603, 11 L.Ed.2d 512 (1964), recognized that an allegation of vote dilution resulting from the drawing of district lines stated a claim under the Fifteenth Amendment.  The plaintiffs in that case argued that congressional districting in New York violated the Fifteenth Amendment because district lines had been drawn in a racially discriminatory fashion.  Each plaintiff had access to the ballot; their complaint was that because of intentional discrimination they resided in a district with population characteristics that had the effect of diluting the weight of their votes.  The Court treated this claim as cognizable under the Fifteenth Amendment. More recently, in United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 97 S.Ct. 996, 51 L.Ed.2d 229 (1977), we again treated an allegation of vote dilution arising from a redistricting scheme as stating a claim under the Fifteenth Amendment.  See id., at 155, 161-162, 165-168, 97 S.Ct., at 1007, 1008, 1009-1011 (opinion of WHITE, J.).  Indeed, in that case Mr. Justice STEWART found no Fifteenth Amendment violation in part because the plaintiffs had failed to prove \"that the redistricting scheme was employed  . . . to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of a minority class or interest;  or otherwise to impair or burden the opportunity of affected persons to participate in the political process.\"  Id., at 179, 97 S.Ct., at 1017 (STEWART, J., joined by POWELL, J., concurring in judgment) (citing, e. g., White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973);  Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433, 85 S.Ct. 498, 13 L.Ed.2d 401 (1965); Wright v. Rockefeller, supra.  See also Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110 (1960).\n\n\n131\nIt is plain, then, that the Fifteenth Amendment shares the concept of vote dilution developed in such Fourteenth Amendment decisions as Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S 533, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964), and Fortson v. Dorsey, supra.  In fact, under the Court's unified view of the protections of the right to vote accorded by disparate portions of the Constitution, the concept of vote dilution is a core principle of the Seventeenth and Nineteenth Amendments as well as the Fourteenth and Fifteenth:\n\n\n132\n\"The Fifteenth amendment prohibits a State from denying      or abridging a Negro's right to vote.  The Nineteenth      amendment does the same for women.  If a State in a statewide      election weighted the male vote more heavily than the female      vote or the white vote more heavily than the Negro vote, none      could successfully contend that that discrimination was      allowable.  See Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461 [73 S.Ct. 809,      97 L.Ed. 1152].  . . .  Once the geographical unit for which      a representative is to be chosen is designated, all who      participate in the election are to have an equal vote      whatever their race, whatever their sex, whatever their      occupation, whatever their income, and wherever their home      may be in that geographical unit.  This is required by the      Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n133\n*          *          *          *          *\n\n\n134\n\"The conception of political equality from the Declaration of      Independence, to Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, to the      Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and Nineteenth Amendments can mean      only one thing\u2014one person, one vote.\"  Gray v. Sanders, 372      U.S., at 379, 381, 83 S.Ct., at 808, 809.\n\n\n135\nThe plurality's suggestion that the Fifteenth Amendment reaches only outright denial of the ballot is wholly inconsistent not only with our prior decisions, but also with the gloss the plurality would place upon the Fourteenth Amendment's protection against vote dilution.  As I explained in Part I, supra, I strongly disagree with the plurality's conclusion that our Fourteenth Amendment vote-dilution decisions have been based upon the Equal Protection Clause's prohibition of racial discrimination.  Be that as it may, the plurality at least does not dispute that the Fourteenth Amendment's language\u2014that \"[n]o State shall  . . .  deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\"\u2014protects against dilution, as well as outright denial, of the right to vote on racial grounds, even though the Amendment does not mention any right to vote and speaks only of the denial, and not the diminution, of rights.  Yet, when the plurality construes the language of the Fifteenth Amendment which explicitly acknowledges the right to vote and prohibits its denial or abridgment on account of race\u2014it seemingly would accord protection against only the absolute abrogation of the ballot.\n\n\n136\nAn interpretation of the Fifteenth Amendment limiting its prohibitions to the outright denial of the ballot would convert the words of the Amendment into language illusory in symbol and hollow in substance.  Surely today's decision should not be read as endorsing that interpretation.26\n\nB\n\n137\nThe plurality concludes that our prior decisions establish the principle that proof of discriminatory intent is a necessary element of a Fifteenth Amendment claim.27  In contrast, I continue to adhere to my conclusion in Beer v. United States, 425 U.S. 148, n. 4, 96 S.Ct., at 1367, n. 4 (dissenting opinion), that \"[t]he Court's decisions relating to the relevance of purpose-and\/or-effect analysis in testing the constitutionality of legislative enactments are somewhat less than a seamless web.\"  As I there explained, at various times the Court's decisions have seemed to adopt three inconsistent approaches:  (1) that purpose alone is the test for unconstitutionality;  (2) that effect alone is the test;  and (3) that purpose or effect, either alone or in combination, is sufficient to show unconstitutionality.  Ibid.  In my view, our Fifteenth Amendment jurisprudence on the necessity of proof of discriminatory purpose is no less unsettled than was our approach to the importance of such proof in Fourteenth Amendment racial discrimination cases prior to Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976).  What is called for in the present cases is a fresh consideration\u2014similar to our inquiry in Washington v. Davis, supra, with regard to Fourteenth Amendment discrimination claims\u2014of whether proof of discriminatory purpose is necessary to establish a claim under the Fifteenth Amendment. I will first justify my conclusion that our Fifteenth Amendment precedents do not control the outcome of this issue, and then turn to an examination of how the question should be resolved.\n\n\n138\n* The plurality cites Guinn v. United States, 238 U.S. 347, 35 S.Ct. 926, 59 L.Ed. 1340 (1915);  Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110 (1960);  Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 603, 11 L.Ed.2d 512 (1964);  Lassiter v. Northampton Election Bd., 360 U.S. 45, 79 S.Ct. 985, 3 L.Ed.2d 1072 (1959);  and Lane v. Wilson, 307 U.S. 268, 59 S.Ct. 872, 83 L.Ed. 1281 (1939), as holding that proof of discriminatory purpose is necessary to support a Fifteenth Amendment claim.  To me, these decisions indicate confusion, not resolution of this issue.  As the plurality suggests, ante, at 62, 100 S.Ct., at 1497, the Court in Guinn v. United States, supra, did examine the purpose of a \"grandfather clause\" in the course of invalidating it.  Yet 24 years later, in Lane v. Wilson, supra, at 277, 59 S.Ct., at 876, the Court struck down a more sophisticated exclusionary scheme because it \"operated unfairly\" against Negroes.  In accord with the prevailing doctrine of the time, see Arizona v. California, 283 U.S. 423, 455, and n. 7, 51 S.Ct. 522, and n. 7, 75 L.Ed. 1154 (1931), the Court in Lane seemingly did not question the motives of public officials.\n\n\n139\nIn upholding the use of a literacy test for voters in Lassiter v. Northampton Election Bd., supra, the Court apparently concluded that the plaintiff had failed to prove either discriminatory purpose or effect.   Gomillion v. Lightfoot, supra, can be read as turning on proof of discriminatory motive, but the Court also stressed that the challenged redrawing of municipal boundaries had the \"essential inevitable effect\" of removing Negro voters from the city, id., 364 U.S., at 341, 81 S.Ct., at 127, and that \"the inescapable human effect of this essay in geometry and geography is to despoil colored citizens, and only colored citizens, of their theretofore enjoyed voting rights,\" id., at 347, 81 S.Ct., at 130.  Finally, in Wright v. Rockefeller, supra, the plaintiffs alleged only purposeful discriminatory redistricting, and therefore the Court had no reason to consider whether proof of discriminatory effect would satisfy the Fifteenth Amendment.28\n\n\n140\nThe plurality ignores cases suggesting that discriminatory purpose is not necessary to support a Fifteenth Amendment claim. In Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S. 461, 73 S.Ct. 809, 97 L.Ed. 1152 (1953), a case in which no majority opinion was issued, three Justices approvingly discussed two decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit29 holding \"that no election machinery could be sustained if its purpose or effect was to deny Negroes on account of their race an effective voice in the governmental affairs of their country, state, or community.\"  Id., at 466, 73 S.Ct., at 812 (opinion of Black, J., joined by Douglas and Burton, JJ.) (emphasis added).  More recently, in rejecting a First Amendment challenge to a federal statute providing criminal penalties for knowing destruction of a Selective Service registration certificate, the Court in United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 383, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1682, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968), stated that \"[i]t is a familiar principle of constitutional law that this Court will not strike down an otherwise constitutional statute on the basis of an alleged illicit legislative motive.\" The Court in O'Brien, supra, at 385, 88 S.Ct., at 1683, interpreted Gomillion v. Lightfoot, supra, as turning on the discriminatory effect, and not the alleged discriminatory purpose, of the challenged redrawing of municipal boundaries.  Three years later, in Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217, 224-225, 91 S.Ct. 1940, 1944-1945, 29 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971), the Court relied on O'Brien to support its refusal to inquire whether a city had closed its swimming pools to avoid racial integration.  As in O'Brien, the Court in Palmer, supra, at 225, 91 S.Ct., at 1945, interpreted Gomillion v. Lightfoot as focusing \"on the actual effect\" of the municipal boundary change, and not upon what motivated the city to redraw its borders.  See also Wright v. Council of City of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 461-462, 92 S.Ct. 2196, 2202, 2203, 33 L.Ed.2d 51 (1972).\n\n\n141\nIn holding that racial discrimination claims under the Equal Protection Clause must be supported by proof of discriminatory intent, the Court in Washington v. Davis, supra, signaled some movement away from the doctrine that such proof is irrelevant to constitutional adjudication.  Although the Court, 426 U.S., at 242-244 and n. 11, 96 S.Ct., at 2048-2050, and n. 11, attempted mightily to distinguish Palmer v. Thompson, supra, its decision was in fact based upon a judgment that, in light of modern circumstances, the Equal Protection Clause's ban on racial discrimination in the distribution of constitutional gratuities should be interpreted as prohibiting only intentional official discrimination.30\n\n\n142\nThese vacillations in our approach to the relevance of discriminatory purpose belie the plurality's determination that our prior decisions require such proof to support Fifteenth Amendment claims.  To the contrary, the Court today is in the same unsettled position with regard to the Fifteenth Amendment as it was four years ago in Washington v. Davis, supra, regarding the Fourteenth Amendment's prohibition of racial discrimination. The absence of old answers mandates a new inquiry.\n\n2\n\n143\nThe Court in Washington v. Davis required a showing of discriminatory purpose to support racial discrimination claims largely because it feared that a standard based solely on disproportionate impact would unduly interfere with the far ranging governmental distribution of constitutional gratuities.31 Underlying the Court's decision was a determination that, since the Constitution does not entitle any person to such governmental benefits, courts should accord discretion to those officials who decide how the government shall allocate its scarce resources.  If the plaintiff proved only that governmental distribution of constitutional gratuities had a disproportionate effect on a racial minority, the Court was willing to presume that the officials who approved the allocation scheme either had made an honest error or had foreseen that the decision would have a discriminatory impact and had found persuasive, legitimate reasons for imposing it nonetheless.  These assumptions about the good faith of officials allowed the Court to conclude that, standing alone, a showing that a governmental policy had a racially discriminatory impact did not indicate that the affected minority had suffered the stigma, frustration, and unjust treatment prohibited under the suspect-classification branch of our equal protection jurisprudence.\n\n\n144\nSuch judicial deference to official decisionmaking has no place under the Fifteenth Amendment.  Section 1 of that Amendment differs from the Fourteenth Amendment's prohibition on racial discrimination in two crucial respects:  it explicitly recognizes the right to vote free of hindrances related to race, and it sweeps no further.  In my view, these distinctions justify the conclusion that proof of racially discriminatory impact should be sufficient to support a claim under the Fifteenth Amendment.  The right to vote is of such fundamental importance in the constitutional scheme that the Fifteenth Amendment's command that it shall not be \"abridged\" on account of race must be interpreted as providing that the votes of citizens of all races shall be of substantially equal weight.  Furthermore, a disproportionate-impact test under the Fifteenth Amendment would not lead to constant judicial intrusion into the process of official decisionmaking.  Rather, the standard would reach only those decisions having a discriminatory effect upon the minority's vote.  The Fifteenth Amendment cannot tolerate that kind of decision, even if made in good faith, because the Amendment grants racial minorities the full enjoyment of the right to vote, not simply protection against the unfairness of intentional vote dilution along racial lines.32\n\n\n145\nIn addition, it is beyond dispute that a standard based solely upon the motives of official decision-makers creates significant problems of proof for plaintiffs and forces the inquiring court to undertake an unguided, tortious look into the minds of officials in the hope of guessing why certain policies were adopted and others rejected.  See Palmer v. Thomp son, 403 U.S., at 224-225, 91 S.Ct., at 1944-1945;  United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S., at 382-386, 88 S.Ct., at 1681-1684;  cf. Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colo., 413 U.S. 189, 224, 227, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 2705, 2706, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973) (POWELL, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  An approach based on motivation creates the risk that officials will be able to adopt policies that are the products of discriminatory intent so long as they sufficiently mask their motives through the use of subtlety and illusion.   Washington v. Davis is premised on the notion that this risk is insufficient to overcome the deference the judiciary must accord to governmental decisions about the distribution of constitutional gratuities.  That risk becomes intolerable, however, when the precious right to vote protected by the Fifteenth Amendment is concerned.\n\n\n146\nI continue to believe, then, that under the Fifteenth Amendment an \"[e]valuation of the purpose of a legislative enactment is just too ambiguous a task to be the sole tool of constitutional analysis.  . . .  [A] demonstration of effect ordinarily should suffice.  If, of course, purpose may conclusively be shown, it too should be sufficient to demonstrate a statute's unconstitutionality.\"  Beer v. United States, 425 U.S., at 149-150, n. 5, 96 S.Ct., at 1368, n. 5 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  The plurality's refusal in this case even to consider this approach bespeaks an indifference to the plight of minorities who, through no fault of their own, have suffered diminution of the right preservative of all other rights.33\n\nIII\n\n147\nIf it is assumed that proof of discriminatory intent is necessary to support the vote-dilution claims in these cases, the question becomes what evidence will satisfy this requirement.34\n\n\n148\nThe plurality assumes, without any analysis, that these cases are appropriate for the application of the rigid test developed in Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S., at 279, 99 S.Ct., at 2296, requiring that \"the decisionmaker  . . .  selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part 'because of,' not merely 'in spite of,' its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\"  In my view, the Feeney standard creates a burden of proof far too extreme to apply in vote-dilution cases.35\n\n\n149\nThis Court has acknowledged that the evidentiary inquiry involving discriminatory intent must necessarily vary depending upon the factual context.  See Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S., at 264-268, 97 S.Ct., at 562-565; Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S., at 253, 96 S.Ct., at 2054 (STEVENS, J., concurring).  One useful evidentiary tool, long recognized by the common law, is the presumption that \"[e]very man must be taken to contemplate the probable consequences of the act he does.\"  Townsend v. Wathen, 9 East. 277, 280, 103 Eng.Rep. 579, 580-581 (K.B.1808).  The Court in Feeney, supra, at 279, n. 25, 99 S.Ct., at 2296, n. 25, acknowledged that proof of foreseeability of discriminatory consequences could raise a \"strong inference that the adverse effects were desired,\" but refused to treat this presumption as conclusive in cases alleging discriminatory distribution of constitutional gratuities.\n\n\n150\nI would apply the common-law foreseeability presumption to the present cases.  The plaintiffs surely proved that maintenance of the challenged multimember districting would have the foreseeable effect of perpetuating the submerged electoral influence of Negroes, and that this discriminatory effect could be corrected by implementation of a single-member districting plan.36 Because the foreseeable disproportionate impact was so severe, the burden of proof should have shifted to the defendants, and they should have been required to show that they refused to modify the districting schemes in spite of, not because of, their severe discriminatory effect.  See Feeney, supra, at 284, 99 S.Ct., at 2299 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  Reallocation of the burden of proof is especially appropriate in these cases, where the challenged state action infringes the exercise of a fundamental right.  The defendants would carry their burden of proof only if they showed that they considered submergenceof the Negro vote a detriment, not a benefit, of the multimember systems, that they accorded minority citizens the same respect given to whites, and that they nevertheless decided to maintain the systems for legitimate reasons.  Cf. Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 576, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977);  Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., supra, at 270-271, n. 21, 97 S.Ct., at 566, n. 21.\n\nThis approach recognizes that\n\n151\n\"[f]requently the most probative evidence of intent will be      objective evidence of what actually happened rather than      evidence describing the subjective state of mind of the      actor.  For normally the actor is presumed to have intended      the natural consequences of his deeds.  This is particularly      true in the case of governmental action which is frequently      the product of compromise, of collective decisionmaking, and      of mixed motivation.\"   Washington v. Davis, supra, 426 U.S.,      at 253, 96 S.Ct., at 2054 (STEVENS, J., concurring).\n\n\n152\nFurthermore, if proof of discriminatory purpose is to be required in these cases, this standard would comport with my view that the degree to which the government must justify a decision depends upon the importance of the interests infringed by it.  See San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S., at 109-110, 93 S.Ct., at 1335, 1336 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).37\n\n\n153\nThe plurality also fails to recognize that the maintenance of multimember districts in the face of foreseeable discriminatory consequences strongly suggests that officials are blinded by \"racially selective sympathy and indifference.\"38  Like outright racial hostility, selective racial indifference reflects a belief that the concerns of the minority are not worthy of the same degree of attention paid to problems perceived by whites.  When an interest as fundamental as voting is diminished along racial lines, a requirement that discriminatory purpose must be proved should be satisfied by a showing that official action was produced by this type of pervasive bias.  In the present cases, the plaintiffs presented strong evidence of such bias:  they showed that Mobile officials historically discriminated against Negroes, that there are pervasive present effects of this past discrimination, and that officials have not been responsive to the needs of the minority community.  It takes only the smallest of inferential leaps to conclude that the decisions to maintain multimember districting having obvious discriminatory effects represent, at the very least, selective racial sympathy and indifference resulting in the frustration of minority desires, the stigmatization of the minority as second-class citizens, and the perpetuation of inhumanity.39\n\nIV\n\n154\nThe American approach to government is premised on the theory that, when citizens have the unfettered right to vote, public officials will make decisions by the democratic accommodation of competing beliefs, not by deference to the mandates of the powerful.  The American approach to civil rights is premised on the complementary theory that the unfettered right to vote is preservative of all other rights.  The theoretical foundations for these approaches are shattered where, as in the present cases, the right to vote is granted in form, but denied in substance.\n\n\n155\nIt is time to realize that manipulating doctrines and drawing improper distinctions under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, as well as under Congress' remedial legislation enforcing those Amendments, make this Court an accessory to the perpetuation of racial discrimination.  The plurality's requirement of proof of intentional discrimination, so inappropriate in today's cases, may represent an attempt to bury the legitimate concerns of the minority beneath the soil of a doctrine almost as impermeable as it is specious.  If so, the superficial tranquility created by such measures can be but short-lived.  If this Court refuses to honor our long-recognized principle that the Constitution \"nullifies sophisticated as well as simple-minded modes of discrimination,\" Lane v. Wilson, 307 U.S., at 275, 59 S.Ct., at 876, it cannot expect the victims of discrimination to respect political channels of seeking redress. I dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n Approximately 35.4% of the residents of Mobile are Negro.\n\n\n2\n 79 Stat. 437, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973.

The Attorney General objected to the legislation on the ground that the city had not shown that \u00a7 2 of the Act would not have the effect of abridging the right of Negroes to vote.  No suit has been brought in the District Court for the District of Columbia to seek clearance under \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act and, accordingly, \u00a7 2 of Act No. 823 is in abeyance.\n\n\n7\n According to the 1979 Municipal Year Book, most municipalities of over 25,000 people conducted at-large elections of their city commissioners or council members as of 1977.

Lightfoot, for the principle that an invidious purpose must be adduced to support a claim of unconstitutionality.  See Personnel Administrator of Mass. v.

Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 603, 11 L.Ed.2d 512 (1964), and Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110 (1960), the Court suggested that legislative purpose alone is determinative, although language in both cases may be isolated that seems to approve some inquiry into effect insofar as it elucidates purpose.\"  Beer v. United States, 425 U.S. 130, 148, n. 4, 96 S.Ct. 1357, 1367, n. 4, 47 L.Ed.2d 629 (dissenting opinion).\nThe Court in the Wright case also rejected claims made under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See infra, at 67.\n\n\n12\n We have made clear, however, that a court in formulating an apportionment plan as an exercise of its equity powers should, as a general rule, not permit multimember legislative districts. \"[S]ingle-member districts are to be preferred in court-ordered legislative reapportionment plans unless the court can articulate a 'singular combination of unique factors' that justifies a different result.  Mahan v. Howell, 410 U.S. 315, 333, 93 S.Ct. 979, 989, 35 L.Ed. 320.\"  Connor v. Finch, 431 U.S. 407, 415, 97 S.Ct. 1828, 1834, 52 L.Ed.2d 465.\n\n\n13\n The dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Marshall reads the Court's opinion in Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433, 85 S.Ct. 498, 13 L.Ed.2d 401, to say that a claim of vote dilution under the Equal Protection Clause could rest on either discriminatory purpose or effect.  Post, at 108.  In fact, the Court explicitly reserved this question and expressed no view concerning it.  That case involved solely a claim, which the Court rejected, that a state legislative apportionment statute creating some multimember districts was constitutionally infirm on its face.  Although the Court recognized that \"designedly or otherwise,\" multimember districting schemes might, under the circumstances of a particular case, minimize the voting strength of a racial group, an issue as to the constitutionality of such an arrangement \"[was] not presented by the record,\" and \" 'our holding ha[d] no bearing on that wholly separate question.' \"  379 U.S., at 439, 85 S.Ct., at 501.\nThe phrase \"designedly or otherwise\" in which this dissenting opinion places so much stock, was repeated, also in dictum in Burns v. Richardson, 384 U.S. 73, 88, 86 S.Ct. 1286, 1294, 16 L.Ed.2d 376.  But the constitutional challenge to the multimember constituencies failed in that case because the plaintiffs demonstrated neither discriminatory purpose nor effect.  Id., at 88-90, and nn. 15 and 16, 86 S.Ct., at 1294-1295 and nn. 15 and 16.\n\n\n14\n In Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U.S. 735, 93 S.Ct. 2321, 37 L.Ed.2d 298, a case decided the same day as White v. Regester, the Court interpreted both White and the earlier vote dilution cases as turning on the existence of discriminatory purpose:\n\"State legislative districts may be equal or substantially equal in population and still be vulnerable under the Fourteenth Amendment.  A districting statute otherwise acceptable, may be invalid because it fences out a racial group so as to deprive them of their pre-existing municipal vote.  Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110 (1960).  A districting plan may create multimember districts perfectly acceptable under equal population standards, but invidiously discriminatory because they are employed 'to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial or political elements of the voting population.'  Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433, 439, 85 S.Ct. 498, 501, 13 L.Ed.2d 401 (1965).  See White v. Regester, post, 412 U.S. p. 755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314;  Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 91 S.Ct. 1858, 29 L.Ed.2d 363 (1971);  Abate v. Mundt, 403 U.S. [182], at 184, n. 2, 91 S.Ct. 1904, 1906, n. 2, 29 L.Ed.2d 399;  Burns v. Richardson, 384 U.S., at 88-89, 86 S.Ct., at 1294-1295.\"  412 U.S., at 751, 93 S.Ct., at 2330-31 (emphasis added).\n\n\n15\n See Wise v. Lipsomb, 437 U.S. 535, 550, 98 S.Ct. 2493, 2501, 57 L.Ed.2d 411 (opinion of REHNQUIST, J.).  It is noteworthy that a system of at-large city elections in place of elections of city officials by the voters of small geographic wards was universally heralded not many years ago as a praiseworthy and progressive reform of corrupt municipal government.  See, e. g., E. Banfield & J. Wilson, City Politics 151 (1963).  Cf., M. Seasongood, Local Government in the United States (1933);  L. Steffens, The Shame of the Cities (1904).\n\n\n16\n This Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals in Zimmer v. McKeithen on grounds other than those relied on by that court and explicitly \"without approval of the constitutional views expressed by the Court of Appeals.\"  East Carroll Parish School Bd. v. Marshall, 424 U.S. 636, 638, 96 S.Ct. 1083, 1085, 47 L.Ed.2d 296 (per curiam ).\n\n\n17\n The only indication given by the District Court of an inference that there existed an invidious purpose was the following statement:  \"It is not a long step from the systematic exclusion of blacks from juries which is itself such an 'unequal application of the law  . . .  as to show intentional discrimination,' Akins v. Texas, 325 U.S. 398, 404, 65 S.Ct. 1276, 1279, 89 L.Ed. 1692,  . . .  to [the] present purpose to dilute the black vote as evidenced in this case.  There\nis a 'current' condition of dilution of the black vote resulting from intentional state legislative inaction which is as effective as the intentional state action referred to in Keyes [v. School District No. 1, Denver Colo., 413 U.S. 189, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 37 L.Ed.2d 548].\"  423 F.Supp., at 398.\nWhat the District Court may have meant by this statement is uncertain.  In any event the analogy to the racially exclusionary jury cases appears mistaken.  Those cases typically have involved a consistent pattern of discrete official actions that demonstrated almost to a mathematical certainty that Negroes were being excluded from juries because of their race.  See Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, 495-497, and n. 17, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 1280-1281, and n. 17, 51 L.Ed.2d 498;  Patton v. Mississippi, 332 U.S. 463, 466-467, 68 S.Ct. 184, 186;  Pierre v. Louisiana, 306 U.S. 354, 359, 59 S.Ct. 536, 539, 83 L.Ed. 757;  Norris v. Alabama, 294 U.S. 587, 591, 55 S.Ct. 579, 580, 79 L.Ed. 1074.\nIf the District Court meant by its statement that the existence of the at-large electoral system was, like the systematic exclusion of Negroes from juries, unexplainable on grounds other than race, its inference is contradicted by the history of the adoption of that system in Mobile.  Alternatively, if the District Court meant that the state legislature may be presumed to have \"intended\" that there would be no Negro Commissioners, simply because that was a foreseeable consequence of at-large voting, it applied an incorrect legal standard.  \" 'Discriminatory purpose'  . . .  implies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences.  . . .  It implies that the decisionmaker  . . .  selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part 'because of,' not merely 'in spite of,' its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\"   Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S., at 279, 99 S.Ct., at 2296 (footnotes omitted.)\n\n\n18\n The Court of Appeals expressed the view that the District Court's finding of discrimination in light of the Zimmer criteria was \"buttressed\" by the fact that the Attorney General had interposed an objection under \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the state statute designating the functions of each Commissioner.  571 F.2d 238, 246 (CA5).  See n. 6, supra.\n\n\n19\n There have been only three Negro candidates for the City Commission, all in 1973.  According to the District Court, the Negro candidates \"were young, inexperienced, and mounted extremely limited campaigns\" and received only \"modest support from the black community  . . . .\"  423 F.Supp., at 388.\n\n\n20\n Among the difficulties with the District Court's view of the evidence was its failure to identify the state officials whose intent it considered relevant in assessing the invidiousness of Mobile's system of government.  To the extent that the inquiry should properly focus on the state legislature, see n. 21, infra, the actions of unrelated governmental officials would be, of course, of questionable relevance.\n\n\n21\n According to the District Court, voters in the city of Mobile are represented in the state legislature by three state senators, any one of whom can veto proposed local legislation under the existing courtesy rule.  Likewise, a majority of Mobile's 11-member House delegation can prevent a local bill from reaching the floor for debate.  Unanimous approval of a local measure by the city delegation, on the other hand, virtually assures passage.  423 F.Supp., at 397.\nThere was evidence in this case that several proposals that would have altered the form of Mobile's municipal government have been defeated in the state legislature, including at least one that would have permitted Mobile to govern itself through a Mayor and City Council with members elected from individual districts within the city.  Whether it may be possible ultimately to prove that Mobile's present governmental and electoral system has been retained for a racially discriminatory purpose, we are in no position now to say.\n\n\n22\n The dissenting opinion seeks to disclaim this description of its theory by suggesting that a claim of vote dilution may require, in addition to proof of electoral defeat, some evidence of \"historical and social factors\" indicating that the group in question is without political influence.  Post, at 111-112, n. 7, 122-124. Putting to the side the evident fact that these gauzy sociological considerations have no constitutional basis, it remains far from certain that they could, in any principled manner, exclude the claims of any discrete political group that happens, for whatever reason, to elect fewer of its candidates than arithmetic indicates it might.  Indeed, the putative limits are bound to prove illusory if the express purpose informing their application would be, as the dissent assumes, to redress the \"inequitable distribution of political influence.\"  Post, at 122.\n\n\n23\n The presumption of constitutional validity that underlies the settled mode of reviewing legislation disappears, of course, if the law under consideration creates classes that, in a constitutional sense, are inherently \"suspect.\"  See McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184, 85 S.Ct. 283, 13 L.Ed.2d 222;  Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 25 L.Ed. 664.  Cf. Lockport v. Citizens for Community Action, 430 U.S. 259, 97 S.Ct. 1047, 51 L.Ed.2d 313.\n\n\n24\n The basic fallacy in the dissenting opinion's theory is illustrated by analogy to a defendant's right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to a trial by a jury of his peers in a criminal case.  See Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491.  That right, expressly conferred by the Constitution, is certainly \"fundamental\" as that word is used in the dissenting opinion.  Moreover, under the Equal Protection Clause, a defendant has a right to require that the State not exclude from the jury members of his race.  See Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S., at 493, 97 S.Ct., at 1279.  But \"[f]airness in selection has never been held to require proportional representation of races upon a jury,\" Akins v. Texas, 325 U.S. 398, 403, 65 S.Ct. 1276, 1279, 89 L.Ed. 1692;  nor has the defendant any \"right to demand that members of his race be included,\" Alexander v. Louisiana, 405 U.S. 625, 628, 92 S.Ct. 1221, 1224, 31 L.Ed.2d 536.  The absence from a jury of persons belonging to racial or other cognizable groups offends the Constitution only \"if it results from purposeful discrimination.\" Castaneda v. Partida, supra, 430 U.S., at 493, 97 S.Ct., at 1279. See Alexander v. Louisiana, supra;  see also Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S., at 239-240, 96 S.Ct., at 2047.  Thus, the fact that there is a constitutional right to a system of jury selection that is not purposefully exclusionary does not entail a right to a jury of any particular racial composition.  Likewise, the fact that the Equal Protection Clause confers a right to participate in elections on an equal basis with other qualified voters does not entail a right to have one's candidates prevail.\n\n\n25\n The dissenting opinion also relies upon several decisions of this Court that have held constitutionally invalid various voter eligibility requirements:  Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 92 S.Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (length of residence requirement); Evans v. Cornman, 398 U.S. 419, 90 S.Ct. 1752, 26 L.Ed.2d 370 (exclusion of residents of federal property);  Kramer v. Union School District, 395 U.S. 621, 89 S.Ct. 1886, 23 L.Ed.2d 583 (property or status requirement);  Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 86 S.Ct. 1079, 16 L.Ed.2d 169 (poll tax requirement).  But there is in this case no attack whatever upon any of the voter eligibility requirements in Mobile.  Nor do the cited cases contain implicit support for the position of the dissenting opinion.  They stand simply for the proposition that \"if a challenged state statute grants the right to vote to some bona fide residents of requisite age and citizenship and denies the franchise to others, the Court must determine whether the exclusions are necessary to promote a compelling state interest.\" Kramer v. Union School District, supra, 395 U.S., at 627, 89 S.Ct., at 1890.  It is difficult to perceive any similarity between the excluded person's right to equal electoral participation in the cited cases, and the right asserted by the dissenting opinion in the present case, aside from the fact that they both in some way involve voting.\n\n\n26\n It is difficult to perceive how the implications of the dissenting opinion's theory of group representation could rationally be cabined.  Indeed, certain preliminary practical questions immediately come to mind:  Can only members of a minority of the voting population in a particular municipality be members of a \"political group\"?  How large must a \"group\" be to be a \"political group\"?  Can any \"group\" call itself a \"political group\"?  If not, who is to say which \"groups\" are \"political groups\"?  Can a qualified voter belong to more than one \"political group\"?  Can there be more than one \"political group\" among white voters (e. g., Irish-American, Italian-American, Polish-American, Jews, Catholics, Protestants)?  Can there be more than one \"political group\" among nonwhite voters?  Do the answers to any of these questions depend upon the particular demographic composition of a given city?  Upon the total size of its voting population? Upon the size of its governing body?  Upon its form of government? Upon its history?  Its geographic location?  The fact that even these preliminary questions may be largely unanswerable suggests some of the conceptual and practical fallacies in the constitutional theory espoused by the dissenting opinion, putting to one side the total absence of support for that theory in the Constitution itself.\n\n\n1\n In Reynolds v. Sims, the Court quoted Mr. Justice Douglas' statement that the right to vote \"includes the right to have the vote counted at full value without dilution or discount  . . . ,\" 377 U.S., at 555, n. 29, 84 S.Ct., at 1378, n. 29, as well as the comment in Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 8, 84 S.Ct. 526, 533, 11 L.Ed.2d 481, that \" 'one man's vote in a congressional election is to be worth as much as another's.' \"  377 U.S., at 559, 84 S.Ct., at 1380.\n\n\n2\n This finding distinguishes this case from White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314.  In White the Court held that, in order to establish a Fourteenth Amendment violation, a group alleging vote dilution must\n\"produce evidence to support findings that the political processes leading to nomination and election were not equally open to participation by the group in question\u2014that its members had less opportunity than did other residents in the district to participate in the political processes and to elect legislators of their choice.\"  Id., at 766, 93 S.Ct., at 2339.\nThe Court affirmed a judgment in favor of black and Mexican-American voters on the basis of the District Court's express findings that black voters had been \" 'effectively excluded from participation in the Democratic primary selection process,' \" id., at 767, 93 S.Ct., at 2340, and that \" ' . . . cultural incompatibility  . . .  conjoined with the poll tax and the most restrictive voter registration procedures in the nation ha[d] operated to effectively deny Mexican-Americans access to the political processes in Texas even longer than the Blacks were formally denied access by the white primary.' \"  Id., at 768, 93 S.Ct., at 2341.\n\n\n3\n Thus, I disagree with Mr. Justice STEWART's conclusion for the plurality that the Fifteenth Amendment applies only to practices that directly affect access to the ballot and hence is totally inapplicable to the case at bar.  Ante, at 65. I also find it difficult to understand why, given this position, he reaches out to decide that discriminatory purpose must be demonstrated in a proper Fifteenth Amendment case.  Ante, at 61-64.\n\n\n4\n \"The petitioners here complain that affirmative legislative action deprives them of their votes and the consequent advantages that the ballot affords.  When a legislature thus singles out a readily isolated segment of a racial minority for special discriminatory treatment, it violates the Fifteenth Amendment.  In no case involving unequal weight in voting distribution that has come before the Court did the decision sanction a differentiation on racial lines whereby approval was given to unequivocal withdrawal of the vote solely from colored citizens.\n*          *          *          *          *\n\"According to the allegations here made, the Alabama Legislature has not merely redrawn the Tuskegee city limits with incidental inconvenience to the petitioners;  it is more accurate to say that it has deprived the petitioners of the municipal franchise and consequent rights and to that end it has incidentally changed the city's boundaries.  While in form this is merely an act redefining metes and bounds, if the allegations are established, the inescapable human effect of this essay in geometry and geography is to despoil colored citizens, and only colored citizens, of their theretofore enjoyed voting rights.\" 364 U.S., at 346, 347, 81 S.Ct., at 130.\n\n\n5\n I also disagree with Mr. Justice MARSHALL to the extent that he implies that the votes cast in an at-large election by members of a racial minority can never be anything more than \"meaningless ballots.\"  I have no doubt that analyses of Presidential, senatorial and other statewide elections would demonstrate that ethnic and racial minorities have often had a critical impact on the choice of candidates and the outcome of elections.  There is no reason to believe that the same political forces cannot operate in smaller election districts regardless of the depth of conviction or emotion that may separate the partisans of different points of view.\n\n\n6\n And this is true regardless of the apparent need of a particular group for proportional representation because of its historically disadvantaged position in the community.  See Cousins v. City Council of Chicago, 466 F.2d 830, 852 (CA7 1972) (Stevens, J., dissenting), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 893, 93 S.Ct. 85, 34 L.Ed.2d 151.  This does not mean, of course, that a legislature is constitutionally prohibited from according some measure of proportional representation to a minority group, see United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 97 S.Ct. 996, 51 L.Ed.2d 229.\n\n\n7\n This view is consistent with the Court's Fourteenth Amendment cases in which it has indicated that attacks on apportionment schemes on racial, political, or economic grounds should all be judged by the same constitutional standard.  See, e. g., Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 149, 91 S.Ct. 1858, 1872, 29 L.Ed.2d 363 (districts that are \"conceived or operated as purposeful devices to further racial or economic discrimination\" are prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment) (emphasis supplied); Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433, 439, 85 S.Ct. 498, 501, 13 L.Ed.2d 401 (an apportionment scheme would be invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment if it \"operate[d] to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial or political elements of the voting population\") (emphasis supplied).\n\n\n8\n Gerrymanders may also be used to preserve the current balance of power between political parties, see, e. g., Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U.S. 735, 93 S.Ct. 2321, 37 L.Ed.2d 298, or to preserve the safe districts of incumbents, cf. Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 603, 11 L.Ed.2d 512.  In Gaffney the Court pointed out:  \"[I]t requires no special genius to recognize the political consequences of drawing a district line along one street rather than another.  It is not only obvious, but absolutely unavoidable, that the location and shape of districts may well determine the political complexion of the area.  District lines are rarely neutral phenomena.  They can well determine what district will be predominantly Democratic or predominantly Republican, or make a close race likely.  Redistricting may pit incumbents against one another or make very difficult the election of the most experienced legislator.  The reality is that districting inevitably has and is intended to have substantial political consequences.\"  412 U.S., at 753, 93 S.Ct., at 2331.\n\n\n9\n Thus, for example, there is little qualitative difference between the motivation behind a religious gerrymander designed to gain votes on the abortion issue and a racial gerrymander designed to gain votes on an economic issue.\n\n\n10\n As Mr. Justice Douglas wrote in his dissent in Wright v. Rockefeller :\n\"Racial electoral registers, like religious ones, have no place in a society that honors the Lincoln tradition\u2014'of the people, by the people, for the people.'  Here the individual is important, not his race, his creed, or his color.  The principle of equality is at war with the notion that District A must be represented by a Negro, as it is within the notion that District B\nmust be represented by a Caucasian, District C by a Jew, District D by a Catholic, and so on.  Cf. Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368, 379, 83 S.Ct. 801, 807, 9 L.Ed.2d 821.  The racial electoral register system weighs votes along one racial line more heavily than it does other votes.  That system, by whatever name it is called, is a divisive force in a community, emphasizing differences between candidates and voters that are irrelevant in the constitutional sense.  Of course race, like religion, plays an important role in the choices which individual voters make from among various candidates.  But government has no business designing electoral districts along racial or religious lines.\n*          *          *          *          *\n\"When racial or religious lines are drawn by the State, the multiracial, multireligious communities that our Constitution seeks to weld together as one becomes separatist;  antagonisms that relate to race or to religion rather than to political issues are generated;  communities seek not the best representative but the best racial or religious partisan.  Since that system is at war with the democratic ideal, it should find no footing here.\" 376 U.S., at 66-67, 84 S.Ct., at 611.\nSee also my dissent in Cousins, supra :\n\"In my opinion an interpretation of the Constitution which afforded one kind of political protection to blacks and another kind to members of other identifiable groups would itself be invidious.  Respect for the citizenry in the black community compels acceptance of the fact that in the long run there is no more certainty that these individuals will vote alike than will individual members of any other ethnic, economic, or social group. The probability of parallel voting fluctuates as the blend of political issues affecting the outcome of an election changes from time to time to emphasize one issue, or a few, rather than others, as dominant.  The facts that a political group has its own history, has suffered its own special injustices, and has its own congeries of special political interests, do not make one such group different from any other in the eyes of the law.  The members of each go to the polls with equal dignity and with an equal right to be protected from invidious discrimination.\"  466 F.2d, at 852.\n\n\n11\n In O'Brien the Court described Gomillion as standing \"not for the proposition that legislative motive is a proper basis for declaring a statute unconstitutional, but that the inevitable effect of a statute on its face may render it unconstitutional.\"\n\n\n12\n \"It is unrealistic, on the one hand, to require the victim of alleged discrimination to uncover the actual subjective intent of the decisionmaker or, conversely, to invalidate otherwise legitimate action simply because an improper motive affected the deliberation of a participant in the decisional process.  A law conscripting clerics should not be invalidated because an atheist voted for it.\"  Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 253, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2054, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (STEVENS, J., concurring).\n\n\n13\n For example, if 55% of the voters in an area comprising two districts belong to group A, their interests in electing two representatives would be best served by evenly dividing the voters in two districts, but their interests in making sure that they elect at least one representative would be served by concentrating a larger majority in one district.  See Cousins v. City Council of Chicago, 466 F.2d, at 855, n. 30 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  See also Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 603, 11 L.Ed.2d 512, where the maintenance of racially separate congressional districts was challenged by one group of blacks and supported by another group having the dominant power in the black-controlled district.\n\n\n14\n I emphasize this point because in my opinion there is a significant difference between a statewide legislative plan that \"happens\" to use multimember districts only in those areas where they disadvantage discrete minority groups and the use of a generally acceptable municipal form of government that involves the election of commissioners by the voters at large.  While it is manifest that there is a substantial neutral justification for a municipality's choice of a commission form of government, it is by no means obvious that an occasional multimember district in a State which typically uses single-member districts can be adequately explained on neutral grounds.  Nothing in the Court's opinion in White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314, describes any purported neutral explanation for the multimember districts in Bexar and Dallas Counties.  In this connection, it should be remembered that Kilgarlin v. Hill, 386 U.S. 120, 87 S.Ct. 820, 17 L.Ed.2d 771, did not uphold the constitutionality of a \"crazy quilt\" of single-member and multimember districts;  rather, in that case this Court merely upheld the findings by the District Court that the plaintiffs had failed to prove their allegations that the districting plan constituted such a crazy quilt.\n\n\n15\n Rejection of Mr. Justice Frankfurter's views in the specific controversy presented by Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663, does not refute the basic wisdom of his call for judicially manageable standards in this area:\n\"Disregard of inherent limits in the effective exercise of the Court's 'judicial Power' not only presages the futility of judicial intervention in the essentially political conflict of forces by which the relation between population and representation has time out of mind been and now is determined.  It may well impair the Court's position as the ultimate organ of 'the supreme Law of the Land' in that vast range of legal problems, often strongly entangled in popular feeling, on which this Court must pronounce.  The Court's authority\u2014possessed of neither the purse nor the sword\u2014ultimately rests on sustained public confidence in its moral sanction.  Such feeling must be nourished by the Court's complete detachment, in fact and in appearance, from political entanglements and by abstention from injecting itself into the clash of political forces in political settlements.\"  Id., at 267, 82 S.Ct., at 737-38 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).\n\n\n1\n U.S.Const., Amdts. 15, 17, 19, 23, 24, 26.\n\n\n2\n I agree with the plurality, see ante, at 60-61, 100 S.Ct. at 1496-1497, that the prohibition on denial or infringement of the right to vote contained in \u00a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973, contains the same standard as the Fifteenth Amendment.  I disagree with the plurality's construction of that Amendment, however.  See Part II, infra.\n\n\n3\n The Court does not quarrel with the generalization that in many instances an electoral minority will fare worse under multimember districting than under single-member districting. Multimember districting greatly enhances the opportunity of the majority political faction to elect all representatives of the district.  In contrast, if the multimember district is divided into several single-member districts, an electoral minority will have a better chance to elect a candidate of its choice, or at least to exert greater political influence.  It is obvious that the greater the degree to which the electoral minority is homogeneous and insular and the greater the degree that bloc voting occurs along majority-minority lines, the greater will be the extent to which the minority's voting power is diluted by multimember districting.  See E. Banfield & J. Wilson, City Politics 91-96, 303-308 (1963);  R. Dixon, Jr., Democratic Representation 12, 476-484, 503-527 (1968);  Bonapfel, Minority Challenges to At-Large Elections:  The Dilution Problem, 10 Ga.L.Rev. 353, 358-360 (1976);  Derfner, Racial Discrimination and the Right to Vote, 26 Vand.L.Rev. 523, 553-555 (1973);  Comment, Effective Representation and Multimember Districts, 68 Mich.L.Rev. 1577, 1577-1579 (1970).  Recent empirical studies have documented the validity of this generalization.  See Berry & Dye, The Discriminatory Effects of At-Large Elections, 7 Fla.St.U.L.Rev. 85, 113-122 (1979);  Jones, The Impact of Local Election Systems on Black Political Representation, 11 Urb.Aff.Q. 345 (1976); Karnig, Black Resources and City Council Representation, 41 J.Pol. 134 (1979);  Karnig, Black Representation on City Councils:  The Impact of District Elections and Socioeconomic Factors, 12 Urb.Aff.Q. 223 (1976);  Sloan, \"Good Government\" and the Politics of Race, 17 Soc.Prob. 161 (1969);  The Impact of Municipal Reformism:  A Symposium, 59 Soc.Sci.Q. 117 (1978).\nThe electoral schemes in these cases involve majority-vote, numbered-post, and staggered-term requirements.  See Bolden v. City of Mobile, 423 F.Supp. 384, 386-387 (SD Ala.1976);  Brown v. Moore, 428 F.Supp. 1123, 1126-1127 (SD Ala.1976).  These electoral rules exacerbate the vote-dilutive effects of multimember districting.  A requirement that a candidate must win by a majority of the vote forces a minority candidate who wins a plurality of votes in the general election to engage in a run off election with his nearest\ncompetitor.  If the competitor is a member of the dominant political faction, the minority candidate stands little chance of winning in the second election.  A requirement that each candidate must run for a particular \"place\" or \"post\" creates head-to-head contests that minority candidates cannot survive.  When a number of positions on a governmental body are to be chosen in the same election, members of a minority will increase the likelihood of election of a favorite candidate by voting only for him.  If the remainder of the electorate splits its votes among the other candidates, the minority's candidate might well be elected by the minority's \"single-shot voting.\"  If the terms of officeholders are staggered, the opportunity for single-shot voting is decreased.  See City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 100 S.Ct. 1548, 64 L.Ed.2d 119 (1980);  Zimmer v. McKeithen, 485 F.2d 1297, 1305 (CA5 1973) (en banc), aff'd on other grounds, sub nom. East Carroll Parish School Bd. v. Marshall, 424 U.S. 636, 96 S.Ct. 1083, 47 L.Ed.2d 296 (1976) (per curiam );  Bonapfel, supra ; Derfner, supra.\n\n\n4\n The plurality notes that at-large elections were instituted in cities as a reform measure to correct corruption and inefficiency in municipal government, and suggests that it \"may be a rash assumption\" to apply vote-dilu-\ntion concepts to a municipal government elected in that fashion. See ante, at 70, and n. 15, 100 S.Ct. at 1502, and n. 15.  To the contrary, local governments are not exempt from the constitutional requirement to adopt representational districting ensuring that the votes of each citizen will have equal weight.  Avery v. Midland County, 390 U.S. 474, 88 S.Ct. 1114, 20 L.Ed.2d 45 (1968). Indeed, in Beer v. United States, 425 U.S. 130, 142, n. 14, 96 S.Ct. 1357, 1364, n. 14, 47 L.Ed.2d 629 (1976), and Abate v. Mundt, 403 U.S. 182, 184, n. 2, 91 S.Ct. 1904, 1906, n. 2, 29 L.Ed.2d 399 (1971), we assumed that our vote-dilution doctrine applied to local governments.\nFurthermore, though municipalities must be accorded some discretion in arranging their affairs, see Abate v. Mundt, supra, there is all the more reason to scrutinize assertions that municipal, rather than state, multi-member districting dilutes the vote of an electoral minority:\n\"In statewide elections, it is possible that a large minority group in one multi-member district will be unable to elect any legislators, while in another multi-member district where the same group is a slight majority, they will elect the entire slate of legislators.  Thus, the multi-member electoral system may hinder a group in one district but prove an advantage in another.  In at-large elections in cities this is not possible.  There is no way to balance out the discrimination against a particular minority group because the entire city is one huge election district.  The minority's loss is absolute.\"  Berry & Dye, supra n. 3, at 87.\nThat at-large elections were instituted as part of a \"reform\" movement in no way ameliorates these harsh effects.  Moreover, in some instances the efficiency and breadth of perspective supposedly resulting from a reform structure of municipal government are achieved at a high cost.  In a white-majority city in which severe racial bloc voting is common, the citywide view allegedly inculcated in city commissioners by at-large elections need not extend beyond the white community, and the efficiency of the commission form of government can be achieved simply by ignoring the concerns of the powerless minority.\nIt would be a mistake, then, to conclude that municipal at-large elections provide an inherently superior representational scheme.  See also n. 3, supra;  Chapman v. Meier, 372 F.Supp. 371, 388-392 (ND 1974) (three-judge court) (Bright, J., dissenting), rev'd, 420 U.S. 1, 95 S.Ct. 751, 42 L.Ed.2d 766 (1975).  It goes without saying that a municipality has the freedom to design its own governance system.  When that system is subjected to constitutional attack, however, the question is whether it was enacted or maintained with a discriminatory purpose or has a discriminatory effect, not whether it comports with one or another of the competing notions about \"good government.\"\n\n\n5\n As the plurality notes, see ante, at 66, 100 S.Ct., at 1499, we indicated in Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S., at 149, 91 S.Ct., at 1872, that multimember districts were unconstitutional if they were \"conceived or operated as purposeful devices to further racial or economic discrimination.\"  The Court in Whitcomb did not, however, suggest that discriminatory purpose was a necessary condition for the invalidation of multimember districting.  Our decision in Whitcomb, supra, at 143, 91 S.Ct., at 1869, acknowledged the continuing validity of the discriminatory-impact test adopted in Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433, 439, 85 S.Ct. 498, 501, 13 L.Ed.2d 401 (1965), and restated it as requiring plaintiffs to prove that \"multi-member districts unconstitutionally operate to dilute or cancel the voting strength of racial or political elements.\"  Whitcomb, supra, 403 U.S., at 144, 91 S.Ct., at 1869 (emphasis added).\nAbate v. Mundt, supra, decided the same day as Whitcomb, provides further evidence that Whitcomb did not alter the discriminatory-effects standard developed in earlier cases.  In Abate, supra, at 184, n. 2, 91 S.Ct., at 1906, n. 2, we rejected the argument that a multimember districting scheme had a vote-dilutive effect because \"[p]etitioners  . . .  have not shown that these multi-member districts, by themselves, operate to impair the voting strength of particular racial or political elements  . . .,  see Burns v. Richardson, 384 U.S. 73, 88, 86 S.Ct. 1286, 1294, 16 L.Ed.2d 376 (1966).\"\n\n\n6\n See n. 3, supra.\n\n\n7\n White v. Regester, makes clear the distinction between the concepts of vote dilution and proportional representation.  We have held that, in order to prove an allegation of vote dilution, the plaintiffs must show more than simply that they have been unable to elect candidates of their choice.  See 412 U.S., at 765-766, 93 S.Ct., at 2339;  Whitcomb v. Chavis, supra, at 149-150, 153, 91 S.Ct., at 1872, 1873.  The Constitution, therefore, does not contain any requirement of proportional representation.  Cf. United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 97 S.Ct. 966, 51 L.Ed.2d 229 (1977);  Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U.S. 735, 93 S.Ct. 2321, 37 L.Ed.2d 298 (1973). When all that is proved is mere lack of success at the polls, the Court will not presume that members of a political minority have suffered an impermissible dilution of political power.  Rather, it is assumed that these persons have means available to them through which they can have some effect on governmental decisionmaking. For example, many of these persons might belong to a variety of other political, social, and economic groups that have some impact on officials.  In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it may be assumed that officials will not be improperly influenced by such factors as the race or place of residence of persons seeking governmental action.  Furthermore, political factions out of office often serve as watchdogs on the performance of the government, bind together into coalitions having enhanced influence, and have the respectability necessary to affect public policy.\nUnconstitutional vote dilution occurs only when a discrete political minority whose voting strength is diminished by a districting scheme proves that historical and social factors render it largely incapable of effectively utilizing alternative avenues of influencing public policy.  See n. 19, infra.  In these circumstances, the only means of breaking down the barriers encasing the political arena is to structure the electoral districting so that the minority has a fair opportunity to elect candidates of its choice.\nThe test for unconstitutional vote dilution, then, looks only to the discriminatory effects of the combination of an electoral structure and historical and social factors.  At the same time, it requires electoral minorities to prove far more than mere lack of success at the polls.\nWe have also spoken of dilution of voting power in cases arising under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973 et seq.  Under \u00a7 5 of that Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c, a state or local government covered by the Act may not enact new electoral procedures having the purpose or effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.  We have interpreted this provision as prohibiting any retrogression in Negro voting power.  Beer v. United States, 425 U.S. 130, 141, 96 S.Ct. 1357, 1363, 47 L.Ed.2d 629 (1976).  In some cases, we have labeled such retrogression a \"dilution\" of the minority vote. See, e. g., City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 100 S.Ct. 1548, 64 L.Ed.2d 119 (1980).  Vote dilution under \u00a7 5, then, involves a standard different from that applied in cases such as White v. Regester, supra, in which diminution of the vote violating the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment is alleged.\n\n\n8\n The plurality's approach is also inconsistent with our statement in Dallas County v. Reese, 421 U.S. 477, 480, 95 S.Ct. 1706, 1707, 44 L.Ed.2d 312 (1975) (per curiam ), that multimember districting violates the Equal Protection Clause if it \"in fact operates impermissibly to dilute the voting strength of an identifiable element of the voting population.\"  See also Chapman v. Meier, 420 U.S., at 17, 95 S.Ct., at 761.\n\n\n9\n See Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969) (right to travel);  Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964) (right to vote); Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963);  and Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891 (1956) (right to fair access to criminal process). Under the rubric of the fundamental right of privacy, we have recognized that individuals have freedom from unjustified governmental interference with personal decisions involving marriage, Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 98 S.Ct. 673, 54 L.Ed.2d 618 (1978);  Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967);  procreation, Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942);  contraception, Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U.S. 678, 97 S.Ct. 2010, 52 L.Ed.2d 675 (1977);  Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972);  Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 328, 13 L.Ed.2d 339 (1965);  abortion, Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973);  family relationships, Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944);  and child rearing and education, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925);  Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923). See also Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 52 L.Ed.2d 675 (1977).\n\n\n10\n As the present cases illustrate, a requirement of proof of discriminatory intent seriously jeopardizes the free exercise of the fundamental right to vote.  Although the right to vote is indistinguishable for present purposes from the other fundamental rights our cases have recognized, see n. 9, supra, surely the plurality would not require proof of discriminatory purpose in those cases.  The plurality fails to articulate why the right to vote should receive such singular treatment.  Furthermore, the plurality refuses to recognize the disutility of requiring proof of discriminatory purpose in fundamental rights cases.  For example, it would make no sense to require such a showing when the question is whether a state statute regulating abortion violates the right of personal choice recognized in Roe v. Wade, supra. The only logical inquiry is whether, regardless of the legislature's motive, the statute has the effect of infringing that right.  See, e. g., Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976).\n\n\n11\n Judge Wisdom of the Court of Appeals below recognized this distinction in a companion case, see Nevett v. Sides, 571 F.2d 209, 231-234 (CA5 1978) (specially concurring opinion).  See also Comment, Proof of Racially Discriminatory Purpose Under the Equal Protection Clause:  Washington v. Davis, Arlington Heights, Mt. Healthy, and Williamsburgh, 12 Harv.Civ.Rights-Civ.Lib.L.Rev. 725, 758, n. 175 (1977);  Note, Racial Vote Dilution in Multimember Districts:  The Constitutional Standard After Washington v. Davis, 76 Mich.L.Rev. 694, 722-726 (1978); Comment, Constitutional Challenges to Gerrymanders, 45 U.Chi.L.Rev. 845, 869-877 (1978).\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976), involved alleged racial discrimination in public employment.  By describing interests such as public employment as constitutional gratuities, I do not, of course, mean to suggest that their deprivation is immune from constitutional scrutiny. Indeed, our decisions have referred to the importance of employment, see Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U.S. 88, 116, 96 S.Ct. 1895, 1911, 48 L.Ed.2d 495 (1976);  Meyer v. Nebraska, supra, 43 S.Ct., at 626;  Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 41, 36 S.Ct. 7, 10, 60 L.Ed. 131 (1915), and we have explicitly recognized that in some circumstances public employment falls within the categories of liberty and property protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, see, e. g., Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974);  Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972). The Court has not held, however, that a citizen has a constitutional right to public employment.\n\n\n12\n We have not, however, held that the Fourteenth Amendment contains an absolute right to vote.  As we explained in Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 92 S.Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972):\n\"In decision after decision, this Court has made clear that a citizen has a constitutionally protected right to participate in elections on an equal basis with other citizens in the jurisdiction.  [Citing cases.]  This 'equal right to vote'  . . . is not absolute;  the States have the power to impose voter qualifications, and to regulate access to the franchise in other ways.  . . .  But, as a general matter, 'before that right [to vote] can be restricted, the purpose of the restriction and the assertedly overriding interests served by it must meet close constitutional scrutiny.' \"  Id., at 336, 92 S.Ct., at 1000 (quoting Evans v. Cornman, 398 U.S. 419, 426, 422, 90 S.Ct. 1752, 1756, 1754, 26 L.Ed.2d 370 (1970)).\n\n\n13\n Avery v. Midland County, 390 U.S. 474, 88 S.Ct. 1114, 20 L.Ed.2d 45 (1968), applied the equal-representation standard of Reynolds v. Sims, to local governments.  See also, e. g., Connor v. Finch, 431 U.S. 407, 97 S.Ct. 1828, 52 L.Ed.2d 465 (1977); Lockport v. Citizens for Community Action, 430 U.S. 259, 97 S.Ct. 1047, 51 L.Ed.2d 313 (1977);  Hadley v. Junior College Dist., 397 U.S. 50, 90 S.Ct. 791, 25 L.Ed.2d 45 (1970).\n\n\n14\n In attempting to limit Reynolds v. Sims to its facts, see ante, at 77-79, 100 S.Ct., at 1505-1506, the plurality confuses the nature of the constitutional right recognized in that decision with the means by which that right can be violated.  Reynolds held that under the Equal Protection Clause each citizen must be accorded an essentially equal voice in the election of representatives.  The Court determined that unequal population distribution in a multi-district representational scheme was one readily ascertainable means by which this right was abridged.  The Court certainly did not suggest, however, that violations of the right to effective political participation mattered only if they were caused by malapportionment.  The plurality's assertion to the contrary in this case apparently would require it to read Reynolds as recognizing fair apportionment as an end in itself, rather than as simply a means to protect against vote dilution.\n\n\n15\n Proof of discriminatory purpose has been equally unnecessary in our decisions assessing whether various impediments to electoral participation are inconsistent with the fundamental interest in voting.  In the seminal case, Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 86 S.Ct. 1079, 16 L.Ed.2d 169 (1966), we invalidated a $1.50 poll tax imposed as a precondition to voting.  Relying on our decision two years earlier in Reynolds v. Sims, see Harper, supra, at 667-668, 670, 86 S.Ct., at 1083, we determined that \"the right to vote is too precious, too fundamental to be so burdened or conditioned,\" 383 U.S., at 670, 86 S.Ct., at 1083.  We analyzed the right to vote under the familiar standard that \"where fundamental rights and liberties are asserted under the Equal Protection Clause, classifications which might invade or restrain them must be closely scrutinized and carefully confined.\"  Ibid.  In accord with Harper, we have applied heightened scrutiny in assessing the imposition of filing fees, e. g., Lubin v. Panish, 415 U.S. 709, 94 S.Ct. 1315, 39 L.Ed.2d 702 (1974);  limitations on who may participate in elections involving specialized governmental entities, e. g., Kramer v. Union School District, 395 U.S. 621, 89 S.Ct. 1886, 23 L.Ed.2d 583 (1969);  durational residency requirements, e. g., Dunn v. Blumstein, supra;  enrollment time limitations for voting in party primary elections, e. g., Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 94 S.Ct. 303, 38 L.Ed.2d 260 (1973);  and restrictions on candidate access to the ballot, e. g., Illinois Elections Bd. v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 99 S.Ct. 983, 59 L.Ed.2d 230 (1979).\nTo be sure, we have approved some limitations on the right to vote.  Compare, e. g., Salyer Land Co. v. Tulare Water District, 410 U.S. 719, 93 S.Ct. 1224, 35 L.Ed.2d 659 (1973), with Kramer v. Union School District, supra.  We have never, however, required a showing of discriminatory purpose to support a claim of infringement of this fundamental interest.  To the contrary, the Court has accepted at face value the purposes articulated for a qualification of this right, and has invalidated such a limitation under the Equal Protection Clause only if its purpose either lacked sufficient substantiality when compared to the individual interests affected or could have been achieved by less restrictive means.  See, e. g., Dunn v. Blumstein, supra, at 335, 337, 343-360, 92 S.Ct., at 999, 1000, 1003-1012.\nThe approach adopted in this line of cases has been synthesized with the one-person, one-vote doctrine of Reynolds v. Sims, in the following fashion:  \"It has been established in recent years that the Equal Protection Clause confers the substantive right to participate on an equal basis with other qualified voters whenever the State has adopted an electoral process for determining who will represent any segment of the State's population.\"  San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 59, n. 2, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 1310, n. 2, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973) (STEWART, J., concurring) (citing Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964);  Kramer v. Union School District, supra;  Dunn v. Blumstein, supra ).  It is plain that this standard requires no showing of discriminatory purpose to trigger strict scrutiny of state interference with the right to vote.\n\n\n16\n See Dorsey v. Fortson, 228 F.Supp. 259, 261 (ND Ga.1964) (three-judge court), rev'd, 379 U.S. 433, 85 S.Ct. 498, 13 L.Ed.2d 629 (1965).\n\n\n17\n Specifically, the plaintiffs contended that countywide voting in the multidistrict counties could, as a matter of mathematics, result in the nullification of the unanimous choice of the voters of one district.   Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S., at 436-437, 85 S.Ct., at 499-500.\n\n\n18\n The same is true of our most recent case discussing vote dilution, Wise v. Lipscomb, 437 U.S. 535, 98 S.Ct. 2493, 57 L.Ed.2d 411 (1978).\n\n\n19\n In contrast to a racial group, however, a political group will bear a rather substantial burden of showing that it is sufficiently discrete to suffer vote dilution.  See Dallas County v. Reese, 421 U.S. 477, 95 S.Ct. 1706, 44 L.Ed.2d 312 (1975) (per curiam ) (allowing city dwellers to attack a countywide multimember district).  See generally Comment, Effective Representation and Multimember Districts, 68 Mich.L.Rev. 1577, 1594-1596 (1970).\n\n\n20\n The dispute in Washington v. Davis, concerned alleged racial discrimination in public employment, an interest to which no one has a constitutional right, see n. 11, supra.  In that decision, the Court held only that \"the invidious quality of a law claimed to be racially discriminatory must ultimately be traced to a racially discriminatory purpose.\"  426 U.S., at 240, 96 S.Ct., at 2048 (emphasis added).  The Court's decisions following Washington v. Davis have also involved alleged discrimination in the allocation of interests falling short of constitutional rights.  Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 60 L.Ed.2d 870 (1979) (alleged sex discrimination in public employment);  Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977) (alleged racial discrimination in zoning).  As explained in Feeney, supra, \"[w]hen some other independent right is not at stake  . . .  and when there is no 'reason to infer antipathy,'  . . .  it is presumed that 'even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process.' \"  442 U.S., at 272, 97 S.Ct., at 567 (quoting Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 97, 99 S.Ct. 939, 943, 59 L.Ed.2d 171 (1979)).\n\n\n21\n Professor Ely has recognized this distinction:\n\"The danger I see is  . . .  that the Court, in its newfound enthusiasm for motivation analysis, will seek to export it to fields where it has no business.  It therefore cannot be emphasized too strongly that analysis of motivation is appropriate only to claims of improper discrimination in the distribution of goods that are constitutionally gratuitous (that is, benefits to which people are not entitled as a matter of substantive constitutional right).  . . .  However, where what is denied is something to which the complainant has a substantive constitutional right \u2014either because it is granted by the terms of the Constitution, or because it is essential to the effective functioning of a democratic government\u2014the reasons it was denied are irrelevant.  It may become important in court what justifications counsel for the state can articulate in support of its denial or nonprovision, but the reasons that actually inspired the denial never can:  To have a right to something is to have a claim on it irrespective of why it is denied.  It would be a tragedy of the first order were the Court to expand its burgeoning awareness of the relevance of motivation into the thoroughly mistaken notion that a denial of a constitutional right does not count as such unless it was intentional.\"  Ely, The Centrality and Limits of Motivation Analysis, 15 San Diego L.Rev. 1155, 1160-1161 (1978) (emphasis in original) (footnotes omitted).\n\n\n22\n It is at this point that my view most diverges from the position expressed by my Brother STEVENS, ante, p. 83, 100 S.Ct., p. 1508.  He would strictly scrutinize state action having an adverse impact on an individual's right to vote.  In contrast, he would apply a less stringent standard to state action diluting the political influence of a group.  See ante, at 83-85, 100 S.Ct., at 1508-1509.  The facts of the present cases, however, demonstrate that severe and persistent racial bloc voting, when coupled with the inability of the minority effectively to participate in the political arena by alternative means, can effectively disable the individual Negro as well as the minority community as a whole.  In these circumstances, Mr. Justice STEVENS' distinction between the rights of individuals and the political strength of groups becomes illusory.\n\n\n23\n The foregoing disposes of any contention that, merely by citing Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 603, 11 L.Ed.2d 512 (1964), the Court in Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S., at 240, 96 S.Ct., at 2047, and Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S., at 264, 97 S.Ct., at 562, intended to bring vote-dilution cases within the discriminatory-purpose requirement.  Wright v. Rockefeller, supra, was a racial gerrymander case, and the plaintiffs had alleged only that they were the victims of an intentional scheme to draw districting lines discriminatorily.  In focusing solely on whether the plaintiffs had proved intentional discrimination, the Court in Wright v. Rockefeller was merely limiting the scope of its inquiry to the issue raised by the plaintiffs.  If Wright v. Rockefeller had been brought after this Court had decided our vote-dilution decisions, the plaintiffs perhaps would have recognized that, in addition to a claim of intentional racial gerrymandering, they could allege an equally sufficient cause of action under the Equal Protection Clause\u2014that the districting lines had the effect of diluting their vote.\nWright v. Rockefeller, then, treated proof of discriminatory purpose as a sufficient condition to trigger strict scrutiny of a districting scheme, but had no occasion to consider whether such proof was necessary to invoke that standard.  Its citations in Washington v. Davis, supra, and Arlington Heights, supra, were useful to show the relevancy, but not the necessity, of evidence of discriminatory intent.  These citations are in no way inconsistent with my view that proof of discriminatory purpose is not a necessary condition to the invalidation of multimember districts that dilute the vote of racial or political elements.\nIn addition, any argument that, merely by citing Wright v. Rockefeller, the Court in Washington v. Davis and Arlington Heights intended to apply the discriminatory-intent requirement to vote-dilution claims is premised on two unpalatable assumptions. First, because the discussion of Wright v. Rockefeller was unnecessary to the resolution of the issues in both of those decisions, the argument assumes that the Court in both cases decided important issues in brief dicta.  Second, the argument assumes that the Court twice intended covertly to overrule the discriminatory-effects test applied in White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973), without even citing White.  Neither assumption is tenable.\n\n\n24\n It is important to recognize that only the four Members of the plurality are committed to this view.  In addition to my Brother BRENNAN and myself, my Brother STEVENS expressly states that proof of discriminatory effect can be a sufficient condition to support the invalidation of districting, see ante, at 90, 100 S.Ct., at 1512.  My Brother WHITE finds the proof of discriminatory purpose in these cases sufficient to support the decisions of the Courts of Appeals, and accordingly he does not reach the issue whether proof of discriminatory impact, standing alone, would suffice under the Fifteenth Amendment.  By Brother BLACKMUN also expresses no view on this issue, since he too finds the proof of discriminatory intent sufficient to support the findings of violations of the Constitution.\n\n\n25\n The plurality states that \"[h]aving found that Negroes in Mobile 'register and vote without hindrance,' the District Court and Court of Appeals were in error in believing that the appellants invaded the protection of that Amendment in the present case.\"  Ante, at 65, 100 S.Ct., at 1499.\n\n\n26\n Indeed, five Members of the Court decline the opportunity to ascribe to this view.  In addition to my Brother BRENNAN and myself, my Brother STEVENS expressly states that the Fifteenth Amendment protects against diminution as well as denial of the ballot, see ante, at 84, and n. 3, 100 S.Ct., at 1509, and n. 3. The dissenting opinion of my Brother WHITE and the separate opinion of my Brother BLACKMUN indicate that they share this view.\n\n\n27\n The plurality does not attempt to support this proposition by relying on the history surrounding the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment.  I agree that we should resolved the issue of the relevancy of proof of discriminatory purpose and effect by examining our prior decisions and by considering the appropriateness of alternative standards in light of contemporary circumstances.  That was, of course, the approach used in Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976), to evaluate that issue with regard to Fourteenth Amendment racial discrimination claims.\n\n\n28\n See n. 23, supra.\n\n\n29\n Rice v. Elmore, 165 F.2d 387 (1947), cert. denied, 333 U.S. 875, 68 S.Ct. 905, 92 L.Ed. 1151 (1948), and Baskin v. Brown, 174 F.2d 391 (1949).\n\n\n30\n See nn. 20, 21, supra, and accompanying text.\n\n\n31\n The Court stated:\n\"A rule that a statute designed to serve neutral ends is nevertheless invalid, absent compelling justification, if in practice it benefits or burdens one race more than another would be far reaching and would raise serious questions about, and perhaps invalidate, a whole range of tax, welfare, public service, regulatory, and licensing statutes that may be more burdensome to the poor and to the average black than to the more affluent white.\"  426 U.S., at 248, 96 S.Ct., at 2051.\nSee n. 20, supra.\n\n\n32\n Even if a municipal policy is shown to dilute the right to vote, however, the policy will not be struck down if the city shows that it serves highly important local interests and is closely tailored to effectuate only those interests.  See Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 92 S.Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972).  Cf. Abate v. Mundt, 403 U.S. 182, 88 S.Ct. 1114, 20 L.Ed.2d 45 (1971).\n\n\n33\n In my view, the standard of White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973), see n. 7, supra, and accompanying text, is the proper test under both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments for determining whether a districting scheme has the unconstitutional effect of diluting the Negro vote. It is plain that the District Court in both of the cases before us made the \"intensely local appraisal\" necessary under White, supra, at 769, 93 S.Ct., at 2341, and correctly decided that the at-large electoral schemes for the Mobile City Commission and County School Board violated the White standard.  As I earlier note with respect to No. 77-1844, see supra, at 122-123, 100 S.Ct., at 1530, the District Court determined:  (1) that Mobile Negroes still suffered pervasive present effects of massive historical official and private discrimination;  (2) that the City Commission and County School Board had been quite unresponsive to the needs of the minority community;  (3) that no Negro had ever been elected to either body, despite the fact that Negroes constitute about one-third of the electorate;  (4) that the persistence of severe racial bloc voting made it highly unlikely that any Negro could be elected at large to either body in the foreseeable future;  and (5) that no state policy favored at-large elections, and the local preference for that scheme was outweighed by the fact that the unconstitutional vote dilution could be corrected only by the imposition of single-member districts.  Bolden v. City of Mobile, 423 F.Supp. 384 (SD Ala.1976);  Brown v. Moore, 428 F.Supp. 1123 (SD Ala.1976).  The Court of Appeals affirmed these findings in all respects.  Bolden v. City of Mobile, 571 F.2d 238 (CA5 1978); Brown v. Moore, 575 F.2d 298 (CA5 1978).  See also the dissenting opinion of my Brother WHITE, ante, p. 94, 100 S.Ct., p. 1514.\n\n\n34\n The statutes providing for at-large election of the members of the two governmental bodies involved in these cases, see n. 33, supra, have been in effect since the days when Mobile Negroes were totally disenfranchised by the Alabama Constitution of 1901.  The District Court in both cases found, therefore, that the at-large schemes could not have been adopted for discriminatory purposes.  Bolden v. City of Mobile, 423 F.Supp., at 386, 397;  Brown v. Moore, 428 F.Supp., at 1126-1127, 1138. The issue is, then, whether officials have maintained these electoral systems for discriminatory purposes.  Cf. Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S., at 257-258, 267-271, and n. 17, 97 S.Ct., at 559, 564-566, and n. 17.\n\n\n35\n As the dissenting opinion of my Brother WHITE demonstrates, however, the facts of these cases compel a finding of unconstitutional vote dilution even under the plurality's standard.\n\n\n36\n Indeed, the District Court in the present cases concluded that the evidence supported the plaintiffs' position that unconstitutional vote dilution was the natural and foreseeable consequence of the maintenance of the challenged multimember districting.  Brown v. Moore, 428 F.Supp., at 1138;  Bolden v. City of Mobile, 423 F.Supp., at 397-398.\n\n\n37\n Mr. Justice STEVENS acknowledges that both discriminatory intent and discriminatory effect are present in No. 77-1844.  See ante, at 92-94, 100 S.Ct. at 1513-1514.  Nonetheless, he finds no constitutional violation, apparently because he believes that the electoral structure of Mobile conforms to a commonly used scheme, the discriminatory impact is in his view not extraordinary, and the structure is supported by sufficient noninvidious justifications so that it is neither wholly irrational nor entirely motivated by discriminatory animus.  To him, racially motivated decisions in this setting are an inherent part of the political process and do not involve invidious discrimination.\nThe facts of the present cases, however, indicate that in Mobile considerations of race are far more powerful and pernicious than are considerations of other divisive aspects of the electorate.  See at 122-123, supra.  In Mobile, as elsewhere, \"the experience of Negroes  . . .  has been different in kind, not just in degree, from that of other ethnic groups.\"  University of California Regents v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 400, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 2805, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978) (opinion of MARSHALL, J.).  An approach that accepts intentional discrimination against Negroes as merely an aspect of \"politics as usual\" strikes at the very hearts of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.\n\n\n38\n Brest, The Supreme Court, 1975 Term\u2014Forword:  In Defense of the Antidiscrimination Principle, 90 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 7 (1976). See also Note, Racial Vote Dilution in Multimember Districts:  The Constitutional Standard After Washington v. Davis, 76 Mich.L.Rev. 694, 716-719 (1978).\n\n\n39\n The plurality, ante, at 74-75, n. 21, 100 S.Ct., at 1504, n. 21, indicates that on remand the lower courts are to examine the evidence in these cases under the discriminatory-intent standard of Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 60 L.Ed.2d 870 (1979), and may conclude that this test is met by proof of the refusal of Mobile's state-legislative delegation to stimulate the passage\nof legislation changing Mobile's city government into a mayor-council system in which council members are elected from single-member districts.  The plurality concludes, then, only that the District Court and the Court of Appeals in each of the present cases evaluated the evidence under an improper legal standard, and not that the evidence fails to support a claim under Feeney, supra.  When the lower courts examine these cases under the Feeney standard, they should, of course, recognize the relevancy of the plaintiffs' evidence that vote dilution was a foreseeable and natural consequence of the maintenance of the challenged multimember districting, and that officials have apparently exhibited selective racial sympathy and indifference.  Cf. Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 443 U.S. 526, 99 S.Ct. 2971, 61 L.Ed.2d 720 (1979);  Columbus Board of Education v. Penick, 443 U.S. 449, 99 S.Ct. 2941, 61 L.Ed.2d 666 (1979).\nFinally, it is important not to confuse the differing views the plurality and I have on the elements of proving unconstitutional vote dilution.  The plurality concludes that proof of intentional discrimination, as defined in Feeney, supra, is necessary to support such a claim.  The plurality finds this requirement consistent with the statement in White v. Regester, 412 U.S., at 766, 93 S.Ct., at 2339, that unconstitutional vote dilution does not occur simply because a minority has not been able to elect representatives in proportion to its voting potential.  The extra necessary element, according to the plurality, is a showing of discriminatory intent.  In the plurality's view, the evidence presented in White going beyond mere proof of under-representation of the minority properly supported an inference that the multimember districting scheme in question was tainted with a discriminatory purpose.\nThe plurality's approach should be satisfied, then, by proof that an electoral scheme enacted with a discriminatory purpose effected a retrogression in the minority's voting power.  Cf. Beer v. United States, 425 U.S. 130, 141, 96 S.Ct. 1357, 1363, 47 L.Ed.2d 629 (1976).  The standard should also be satisfied by proof that a scheme maintained for a discriminatory purpose has the effect of submerging minority electoral influence below the level it would have under a reasonable alternative scheme.\nThe plurality does not address the question whether proof of discriminatory-effect is necessary to support a vote-dilution claim.  It is clear from the above, however, that if the Court at some point creates such a requirement, it would be satisfied by proof of mere disproportionate impact.  Such a requirement would be far less stringent than the burden of proof required under the rather rigid discriminatory effects test I find in White v. Regester, supra.  See n. 7, supra, and accompanying text.\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"333 U.S. 565\n68 S.Ct. 705\n92 L.Ed. 881\nMOORE et al.v.PEOPLE OF STATE OF NEW YORK.\nNo. 485.\nArgued Feb. 12, 1948.\nDecided March 29, 1948.\n\nMessrs. John F. Wilkinson and I. Saul Fleischman, both of New York City, for petitioners.\nMr. George Tilzer, of New York City, for respondent.\nMr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nPetitioners were indicted in Bronx County, New York, on February 11, 1947, for the crime of murder in the first degree. The District Attorney moved the court for an order that the trial be by a special jury, pursuant to New York law, which motion was granted over opposition on behalf of defendants by assigned counsel. One hundred and fifty names were drawn from the special jury panel, under supervision of a Justice of the State Supreme Court, in the presence of defendants' counsel and without objection.\n\n\n2\nWhen the case was called for trial defendants, as permitted by the state practice, served a written challenge to the panel of jurors upon the following grounds:\n\n\n3\n1. That \u00a7 749-aa of the Judiciary Law of the State of New York, Consol.Laws, c. 30, is in violation of \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n\n4\n2. That qualified Negro jurors were improperly excluded from the list of special jurors, from which said jury panel was drawn.\n\n\n5\n3. That qualified women jurors were improperly excluded from the list of special jurors, from which said jury panel was drawn.\n\n\n6\nAfter full hearing, the challenge was disallowed and petitioners were tried and convicted. On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the third ground of challenge to the jury panel was abandoned and the convictions were affirmed. 297 N.Y. 734, 77 N.E.2d 25. We granted certiorari on a petition raising the remaining grounds. 332 U.S. 843, 68 S.Ct. 266.\n\n\n7\nThe constitutionality of the New York special jury statutes has but recently been sustained by this Court, Fay v. People of State of New York, 332 U.S. 261, 67 S.Ct. 1613, against a better supported challenge than is here presented, and the issue warrants little discussion at this time.\n\n\n8\nSome effort is made by statistics to differentiate this case from the precedent one as to the ratio of convictions before special juries contrasted with that before ordinary juries. The defendants present to us a study from July 1, 1937, to June 30, 1946, which indicates that special juries in Bronx County returned 15 convictions and 4 acquittals during the period and concludes that the special jury convicted in 79% of the cases while the general juries convicted in 57%. The District Attorney responds that in 5 of these 19 cases, the special jury returned conviction in a lesser degree than that charged and, hence in 9 out of 19 cases withheld all or part of what the State asked. Moe over, it is said that all but two were capital cases, another was for manslaughter and one for criminally receiving stolen property. It should be observed that the number of cases involved in these statements is too small to afford a secure basis for generalizing as to the convicting propensities of the two jury panels, even if the cases were comparable. But it appears that in Bronx County a system of special and intensive investigation is applied to capital cases from the moment they are reported, more careful preparation is given them and they are tried by the most experienced prosecutors. This makes this class of cases not fairly comparable with the run-of-the-mill cases, felony and misdemeanor, that are included in the ordinary jury statistics. Moreover, none of these facts were laid before the trial court which was in the best position to analyze, supplement or interpret them. We think on this part of the challenge no question is presented that was not disposed of in Fay v. New York, supra. Indeed, on opening the hearing on defendants' challenge the trial court said, 'I understand the inquiry now is to be directed to the intentional elimination or disqualification of women and Negroes on the special jury panel.' Counsel for both defendants assented to this definition of the issues and no evidence on other subjects was offered.\n\n\n9\nPetitioners' remaining point is that 'the trial of the petitioners, Negroes, by a jury selected from a panel from which Negroes were systematically, intentionally and deliberately excluded, denied petitioners the equal protection of law and due process of law guaranteed them by the Constitution of the United States.' If the evidence supported the assumption of fact included in this statement, the point would be of compelling merit. The law on this subject is now so settled that we no longer find it necessary to write out expositions of the Constitution in this regard. See Brunson et al. v. North Carolina, 333 U.S. 851, 68 S.Ct. 634.\n\n\n10\nIt is admitted that on this panel of one hundred and fifty there were no Negroes. But not only is the record wanting in proof of intentional and systematic exclusion\u2014the only witnesses sworn testified that there was no such practice or intent. Nothing in the background facts discredits this testimony. The census figures give a proportion of Negro-to-white population in that county of .7% in 1920, 1.0% in 1930, and 1.7% in 1940. It is admitted that since the last census the Negro population has considerably increased. According to one estimate, the number of colored inhabitants, which in 1940 was 24,892, has increased to 192,066 in 1948. The same estimator later revised the figures to between 65,000 and 70,000. Neither estimate was before the trial court, and no evidence or finding gives us judicially approved data. Of course, new wartime arrivals take some time to qualify as active members of the community and its machinery of justice cannot be expected instantaneously to reflect their presence. The official who compiled the jury lists testified as to Negro jurors that 'from 1946 on I must have examined at least 500 myself.' The number accepted for service could not be ascertained from the records, which make no notation of color, but he testified that there were 'maybe two dozen; maybe three dozen.' For the special panel, he testified that he had examined an estimated one hundred Negroes and had accepted 'maybe a dozen.' The testimony is undenied.\n\n\n11\nThe record is utterly devoid of proof of systematic, intentional and deliberate exclusion of Negroes from jury duty.\n\n\n12\nThe judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n13\nAffirmed.\n\n\n14\nMr. Justice MURPHY, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE concur, dissenting.\n\n\n15\nThis case represents a tragic consequence that can flow from the use of the 'blue ribbon' jury. Two men must forfeit their lives after having been convicted of murder not by a jury of their peers, not by a jury chosen from a fair cross-section of the community, but y  a jury drawn from a special group of individuals singled out in a manner inconsistent with the democratic ideals of the jury system. That group was chosen because they possessed some trait or characteristic which distinguished them from the general panel of jurors, some qualification which made them more desirable for the State's purpose of securing the conviction of the two petitioners. Such a basis for jury selection has no place in our constitutional way of life. It contravenes the most elementary notions of equal protection and I can no more acquiesce in its use in this case than I was able to do in Fay v. People of State of New York, 332 U.S. 261, 67 S.Ct. 1613.\n\n\n16\nThe constitutional invalidity of this 'blue ribbon' system does not depend upon proof of the systematic and intentional exclusion of any economic, racial or social group. Nor does it rest upon a demonstration that 'blue ribbon' juries are more inclined to convict than ordinary juries. Such factors are frequently, if not invariably, present in 'blue ribbon' situations, though proof is extremely difficult. But they are at best only the end products of the system, not the root evil.\n\n\n17\nThe vice lies in the very concept of 'blue ribbon' panels\u2014the systematic and intentional exclusion of all but the 'best' or the most learned or intelligent of the general jurors. Such panels are completely at war with the democratic theory of our jury system, a theory formulated out of the experience of generations. One is constitutionally entitled to be judged by a fair sampling of all one's neighbors who are qualified, not merely those with superior intelligence or learning. Jury panels are supposed to be representative of all qualified classes. Within those classes, of course, are persons with varying degrees of intelligence, wealth, education, ability and experience. But it is from that welter of qualified individuals, who meet specified minimum standards, that juries are to be chosen. Any method that permits only the 'best' of these to be selected opens the way to grave abuses. The jury is then in danger of losing its democratic flavor and becoming the instrument of the select few.\n\n\n18\nHence the 'blue ribbon' method of selecting only the 'best' of the general jurors, a method instituted with the highest of intentions, does violence to the fundamental precepts of the jury system. Appeals to administrative convenience do not soften that violence. And since the method deprives the defendant of the protection accorded others who are able to draw upon the general panel, it falls under the ban of the Fourteenth Amendment. I would therefore reverse the judgment below.\n\n","label":1}

Coven, New York City, for petitioner.\nCharles Gordon, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nWilliam H. Dempsey, Jr., Washington, D.C., as amicus curiae, in support of judgment below, at the invitation of the Court.\nMr. Justice HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe narrow question presented by this case is whether jurisdiction to review the denial of a stay of deportation, if the pertinent order has not been entered in the course of a proceeding conducted under \u00a7 242(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 209, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b), is, under \u00a7 106(a) of the Act, 75 Stat. 651, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), vested exclusively in the courts of appeals.1 The question arises from the following circumstances.\n\n\n2\nPetitioner, a native and citizen of China, evidently entered the United States in 1965 as a seaman.2 The terms of his entry permitted him to remain in this country for the period during which his vessel was in port, provided that this did not exceed 29 days. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1282(a).3 He deserted his vessel, and remained unlawfully in the United States. After petitioner's eventual apprehension, deportation proceedings were conducted by a special inquiry officer under the authority of \u00a7 242(b). Petitioner conceded his deportability, but sought and obtained permission to depart the United States voluntarily.4 Despite his protestations of good faith, petitioner did not voluntarily depart, and was ultimately ordered to surrender for deportation. He then requested a stay of deportation from a district director of immigration, pending the submission and disposition of an application for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a)(7) (1964 ed., Supp. II).5 The district director concluded that petitioner is ineligible for such an adjustment of status, and denied a stay of deportation.\n\n\n3\nPetitioner thereupon commenced these proceedings in the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, petitioning for review of the denial of a stay. The Court of Appeals held that the provisions of \u00a7 106(a), under which it would otherwise have exclusive jurisdiction to review the district director's order, are inapplicable to orders denying ancillary relief unless those orders either are entered in the course of a proceeding conducted under \u00a7 242(b), or are denials of motions to reopen such proceedings. The court dismissed the petition for want of jurisdiction. 381 F.2d 542. We granted certiorari because the courts of appeals have disagreed as to the proper construction of the pertinent statutory provisions.6 390 U.S. 918, 88 S.Ct. 848, 19 L.Ed.2d 978. For reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\nI.\n\n4\nIt is useful first to summarize the relevant provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and of the regulations promulgated under the Act's authority. Section 242(b) provides a detailed administrative procedure for determining whether an alien may be deported. It permits the entry of an order of deportation only upon the basis of a record made in a proceeding before a special inquiry officer, at which the alien is assured rights to counsel, to a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against him, to cross-examine witnesses, and to present evidence in his own behalf. By regulation, various forms of discretionary relief may also be sought from the special inquiry officer in the course of the deportation proceeding; an alien may, for example, request that his deportation be temporarily withheld, on the ground that he might, in the country to which he is to be deported, 'be subject to persecution * * *.' See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h) (1964 ed., Supp. II); 8 CFR \u00a7 242.8(a).\n\n\n5\nOther forms of discretionary relief may be requested after termination of the deportation proceeding. The regulations thus provide that an alien 'under a final administrative order of deportation' may apply to the district director 'having jurisdiction over the place where the alien is at the time of filing' for a stay of deportation. 8 CFR \u00a7 243.4. The stay may be granted by the district director 'in his discretion.' Ibid. If the stay is denied, the denial 'is not appealable' to the Board of Immigration Appeals. Ibid.\n\n\n6\nSection 106(a)7 provides that the procedures for judicial review prescribed by the Hobbs Act, 64 Stat. 1129, 68 Stat. 961, 'shall apply to, and shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for, the judicial review of all final orders of deportation heretofore or hearafter made against aliens * * * pursuant to administrative proceedings under section 242(b) of this Act * * *.' These procedures vest in the courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction to review final orders issued by specified federal agencies. In situations to which the provisions of \u00a7 106(a) are inapplicable, the alien's remedies would, of course, ordinarily lie first in an action brought in an appropriate district court.\n\n\n7\nThe positions of the various parties may be summarized as follows. We are urged by both petitioner and the Immigration Service to hold that the provisions of \u00a7 106(a) are applicable to the circumstances presented by this case, and that judicial review thus is available only in the courts of appeals. The Immigration Service contends that \u00a7 106(a) should be understood to embrace all determinations 'directly affecting the execution of the basic deportation order,' whether those determinations have been reached prior to, during, or subsequent to the deportation proceeding.8 In contrast, amicus9 urges, as the Court of Appeals held, that \u00a7 106(a) encompasses only those orders made in the course of a proceeding conducted under \u00a7 242(b) or issued upon motions to reopen such proceedings.\n\nII.\n\n8\nThis is the third case in which we have had occasion to examine to effect of \u00a7 106(a). In the first, Foti v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 375 U.S. 217, 84 S.Ct. 306, 11 L.Ed.2d 281, the petitioner, in the course of a proceeding conducted under \u00a7 242(b), conceded his deportability but requested a suspension of deportation under \u00a7 244(a)(5). The special inquiry officer denied such a suspension, and petitioner's appeal from the denial was dismissed by the Board of Immigration Appeals. Petitioner commenced an action in the district court, but the action was dismissed on the ground that, under \u00a7 106(a), his exclusive remedy lay in the courts of appeals. He then petitioned for review to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, but it dismissed for want of jurisdiction. A divided court held en banc that the procedures of \u00a7 106(a) were inapplicable to denials of discretionary relief under \u00a7 244(a)(5). 308 F.2d 779. On certiorari, we reversed, holding that 'all determinations made during and incident to the administrative proceeding conducted by a special inquiry officer, and reviewable together by the Board of Immigration Appeals * * * are * * * included within the ambit of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals under \u00a7 106(a).' 375 U.S., at 229, 84 S.Ct. at 314.\n\n\n9\nIn the second case, Giova v. Rosenberg, 379 U.S. 18, 85 S.Ct. 156, 13 L.Ed.2d 90, petitioner moved before the Board of Immigration Appeals to reopen proceedings, previously conducted under \u00a7 242(b), that had terminated in an order for his deportation. The Board denied relief. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that the Board's denial was not embraced by \u00a7 106(a), and dismissed the petition for want of jurisdiction. 308 F.2d 347. On certiorari, this Court held, in a brief per curiam opinion, that such orders were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of appeals.\n\n\n10\nAlthough Foti strongly suggests the result that we reach today, neither it nor Giova can properly be regarded as controlling in this situation. Unlike the order in Foti, the order in this case was not entered in the course of a proceeding conducted by a special inquiry officer under \u00a7 242(b); unlike the order in Giova the order here did not deny a motion to reopen such a proceeding. We regard the issue of statutory construction involved here as markedly closer than the questions presented in those cases; at the least, it is plainly an issue upon which differing views may readily be entertained. In these circumstances, it is imperative, if we are accurately to implement Congress' purposes, to 'seiz(e) everything from which aid can be derived.' Fisher v. Blight, 2 Cranch 358, 386, 2 L.Ed. 304.\n\n\n11\nIt is important, first, to emphasize the character of the statute with which we are concerned. Section 106(a) is intended exclusively to prescribe and regulate a portion of the jurisdiction of the federal courts. As a jurisdictional statute, it must be construed both with precision and with fidelity to the terms by which Congress has expressed its wishes. Utah Junk Co. v. Porter, 328 U.S. 39, 44, 66 S.Ct. 889, 892, 90 L.Ed. 1071. Further, as a statute addressed entirely to 'specialists,' it must, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter observed, 'be read by judges with the minds of * * * specialists.'10\n\n\n12\nWe cannot, upon close reading, easily reconcile the position urged by the Immigration Service with the terms of \u00a7 106(a). A denial by a district director of a stay of deportation is not literally a 'final order of deportation,' nor is it, as was the order in Foti, entered in the course of administrative proceedings conducted under \u00a7 242(b).11 Thus, the order in this case was issued more than three months after the entry of the final order of deportation,12 in proceedings entirely distinct from those conducted under \u00a7 242(b), by an officer other than the special inquiry officer who, as required by \u00a7 242(b), presided over the deportation proceeding. The order here did not involve the denial of a motion to reopen proceedings conducted under \u00a7 242(b), or to reconsider any final order of deportation. Concededly, the application for a stay assumed the prior existence of an order of deportation, but petitioner did not 'attack the deportation order itself but instead (sought) relief not inconsistent with it.' Mui v. Esperdy, 371 F.2d 772, 777 (C.A.2nd cir.). If, as the Immigration Service urges, \u00a7 106(a) embraces all determinations 'directly affecting the execution of' a final deportation order, Congress has selected language remarkably inapposite for its purpose. As Judge Friendly observed in a similar case, if 'Congress had wanted to go that far, presumably it would have known how to say so.' Ibid.\n\n\n13\nThe legislative history of \u00a7 106(a) does not strengthen the position of the Immigration Service. The 'basic purpose' of the procedural portions of the 1961 legislation was, as we stated in Foti, evidently 'to expedite the deportation of undesirable aliens by preventing successive dilatory appeals to various federal courts * * *.' 375 U.S., at 226, 84 S.Ct. at 312. Congress prescribed for this purpose several procedural innovations, among them the device of direct petitions for review to the courts of appeals. Although, as the Immigration Service has emphasized, the broad purposes of the legislation might have been expected to encompass orders denying discretionary relief entered outside \u00a7 242(b) proceedings, there is evidence that Congress deliberately restricted the application of \u00a7 106(a) to orders made in the course of proceedings conducted under \u00a7 242(b).\n\n\n14\nThus, during a colloquy on the floor of the House of Representatives, to which we referred in Foti,13 Representative Moore, co-sponsor of the bill then under discussion, suggested that any difficulties resulting from the separate consideration of deportability and of discretionary relief could be overcome by 'a change in the present administrative practice of considering the issues * * * piecemeal. There is no reason why the Immigration Service could not change its regulations to permit contemporaneous court consideration of deportability and administrative application for relief.' 105 Cong.Rec. 12728. In the same colloquy, Representative Walter, the chairman of the subcommittee that conducted the pertinent hearings, recognized that certain forms of discretionary relief may be requested in the course of a deportation proceeding, and stated that \u00a7 106(a) would apply to the disposition of such requests, 'just as it would apply to any other issue brought up in deportation proceedings.' 105 Cong.Rec. 12728 (emphasis added). Similarly, Representative Walter, in a subsequent debate, responded to a charge that judicial review under \u00a7 106(a) would prove inadequate because of the absence of a suitable record, by inviting 'the gentleman's attention to the law in section 242, in which the procedure for the examiner is set forth in detail.' 107 Cong.Rec. 12179.\n\n\n15\nWe believe that, in combination with the terms of \u00a7 106(a) itself, these statements lead to the inference that Congress quite deliberately restricted the application of \u00a7 106(a) to orders entered during proceedings conducted under \u00a7 242(b), or directly challenging deportation orders themselves.14 This is concededly 'a choice between uncertainties,' but we are 'content to choose the lesser.' Burnet v. Guggenheim, 288 U.S. 280, 288, 53 S.Ct. 369, 371, 77 L.Ed. 748.\n\n\n16\nWe need not speculate as to Congress' purposes. Quite possible, as Judge Browning has persuasively suggested, 'Congress visualized a single administrative proceeding in which all questions relating to an alien's deportation would be raised and resolved, followed by a single petitiion in a court of appeals for judicial review * * *.' Yamada v. Immigration & Naturalization Service, 384 F.2d 214, 218. It may therefore be that Congress expected the Immigration Service to include within the \u00a7 242(b) proceeding 'all issues which might affect deportation.' Ibid. Possibly, as amicus cogently urges, Congress wished to limit petitions to the courts of appeals to situations in which quasi-judicial hearings had been conducted.15 It is enough to emphasize that neither of these purposes would be in any fashion impeded by the result we reach today. We hold that the judicial review provisions of \u00a7 106(a) embrace only those determinations made during a proceeding conducted under \u00a7 242(b), including those determinations made incident to a motion to reopen such proceedings.16\n\n\n17\nThis result is entirely consistent with our opinion in Foti. There, it was repeatedly stated in the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE that the order held reviewable under \u00a7 106(a) had, as the regulations required, been entered in the course of a proceeding conducted under \u00a7 242(b). 375 U.S., at 218, 222\u2014223, 224, 226, 228, 229, 232, 84 S.Ct. at 308, 310\u2014311, 312, 313, 314, 315. It was emphasized that 'the administrative discretion to grant a suspension of deportation,' the determination involved in Foti, 'has historically been consistently exercised as an integral part of the proceedings which have led to the issuance of a final deportation order.' Id., at 223, 84 S.Ct. at 310. A suspension of deportation 'must be requested prior to or during the deportation hearing.' Ibid. Moreover, it was explicitly recognized that, although modification of the pertinent regulations might 'effectively broaden or narrow the scope of review available in the Courts of Appeals,' this was 'nothing anomalous.'17 Id., at 229\u2014230, 84 S.Ct. at 314. An essential premise of Foti was thus that the application of \u00a7 106(a) had been limited to orders 'made during the same proceedings in which deportability is determined * * *.' Id., at 224, 84 S.Ct. at 311.\n\n\n18\nThe per curiam opinion in Giova did not take a wider view of \u00a7 106(a). The denial of an application to reopen a deportation proceeding is readily distinguishable from a denial of a stay of deportation, in which there is no attack upon the deportation order or upon the proceeding in which it was entered. Petitions to reopen, like motions for rehearing or reconsideration, are, as the Immigration Service urged in Foti, 'intimately and immediately associated' with the final orders they seek to challenge.18 Thus, petitions to reopen deportation proceedings are governed by the regulations applicable to the deportation proceeding itself, and, indeed, are ordinarily presented for disposition to the special inquiry officer who entered the deportation order.19 The result in Giova was thus a logical concomitant of the construction of \u00a7 106(a) reached in Foti; it did not, explicitly or by implication, broaden that construction in any fashion that encompasses this situation.\n\n\n19\nThe result we reach today will doubtless mean that, on occasion, the review of denials of discretionary relief will be conducted separately from the review of an order of deportation involving the same alien. Nonetheless, this does not seem an onerous burden, nor is it one that cannot be avoided, at least in large part, by appropriate action of the Immigration Service itself. More important, although 'there is no table of logarithms for statutory construction,'20 it is the result that we believe most consistent both with Congress' intentions and with the terms by which it has chosen to express those intentions.\n\n\n20\nAffirmed.\n\n\n21\nMr. Justice WHITE, dissenting.\n\n\n22\nIf the special inquiry officer had possessed jurisdiction to issue a stay order pending petitioner's efforts to obtain discretionary relief from the District Director, I take it that his denial of the stay, like a refusal to re-open, would have been appealable to the Court of Appeals. But, as I understand it, no stay could have been granted by the hearing officer and it was sought from the District Director as an immediate consequence of there being outstanding a final order of deportation, which, if executed, might moot the underlying request for relief from the District Director. Section 106 does not limit judicial review in the Court of Appeals to orders entered 'in the course of' \u00a7 242(b) proceedings, but extends it to all orders against aliens entered 'pursuant' to such proceedings, that is, at least as Webster would have it,* 'acting or done in consequence' of the \u00a7 242(b) proceedings. Except for the order of deportation, there would have been no occasion of need to seek a stay. It hardly strains congressional intention to give the word 'pursuant' its ordinary meaning in the English language. If there are reasons based on policy for the Court's contrary conclusion, they are not stated. I would reverse the judgment.\n\n\n\n1\n We emphasize that no questions are presented as to petitioner's deportability or as to the propriety in his situation of any discretionary relief. We intimate no views on any such questions.\n\n\n2\n The facts concerning petitioner's entry into, and subsequent stay in, the United States appear to have been conceded in the proceeding before the special inquiry officer.\n\n\n3\n Section 1282(a) provides in relevant part that '(a) No alien crewman shall be permitted to land temporarily in the United States except * * * for a period of time, in any event, not to exceed\u2014(1) the period of time (not exceeding twenty-nine days) during which the vessel * * * remains in port * * *.'\n\n\n4\n We note, as we did in Foti v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 375 U.S. 217, 84 S.Ct. 306, 11 L.Ed.2d 281, that the 'granting of voluntary departure relief does not result in the alien's not being subject to an outstanding final order of deportation.' Id., at 219, n. 1, 84 S.Ct. at 308.\n\n\n5\n Section 1153(a)(7) (1964 ed., Supp. II) provides in part that '(c) onditional entries shall next be made available * * * to aliens who satisfy an Immigration and Naturalization Service officer * * * that (1) because of persecution or fear of persecution * * * they have fled * * * from any Communist or Communist-dominated country * * *.' Conditional entries are available only to refugees, and, like the parole system, grant 'temporary harborage in this country for humane considerations or for reasons rooted in public interest.' C. Gordon & H. Rosenfield, Immigration Law and Procedure \u00a7 2.54 (1967). See also id., at \u00a7 2.27h.\n\n\n6\n Compare the following: Skiftos v. Immigration & Naturalization Service, 332 F.2d 203 (C.A.7th Cir.); Talavera v. Pederson, 334 F.2d 52 (C.A.6th Cir.); Samala v. Immigration & Naturalization Service, 336 F.2d 7 (C.A.5th Cir.); Mendez v. Major, 340 F.2d 128 (C.A.8th Cir.); Melone v. Immigration & Naturalization Service, 355 F.2d 533 (C.A.7th Cir.); Mui v.

Cir.).\n\n\n7\n Section 106(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), was added to the Immigration and Nationality Act by \u00a7 5(a) of Public Law 87\u2014301, approved September 26, 1961, 75 Stat. 651.\n\n\n8\n Brief for Respondent 28.\n\n\n9\n Since the Immigration Service had aligned itself with petitioner on this question, the Court invited William H. Dempsey, Jr., Esquire, a member of the Bar of this Court, to appear and present oral argument as amicus curiae in support of the judgment below. 390 U.S. 918, 88 S.Ct. 848, 19 L.Ed.2d 978.\n\n\n10\n Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 2 Record of N.Y.C.B.A. 213, 225.\n\n\n11\n We find the emphasis placed in dissent upon the word 'pursuant' in \u00a7 106(a) unpersuasive. First, \u00a7 106(a) was evidently limited to those final orders of deportation made 'pursuant to administrative proceedings under section 242(b)' simply because Congress preferred to exclude from it those deportation orders entered without a \u00a7 242(b) proceeding. This would, for example, place orders issued under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1282(b), by which the Immigration Service may revoke a seaman's conditional permit to land and deport him, outside the judicial review procedures of \u00a7 106(a). See generally C. Gordon & H. Rosenfield, Immigration Law and Procedure \u00a7 5.11 (1967). Perhaps this suggests, as amicus urges, that \u00a7 106(a) was intended to be limited to situations in which quasi-judicial proceedings, such as those under \u00a7 242(b), have been conducted. It certainly indicates that the reference in \u00a7 106(a) to \u00a7 242(b) proceedings was intended to limit, and not to broaden, the classes of orders to which \u00a7 106(a) may be applied. Second, it must be reiterated that \u00a7 106(a) does not, as the dissenting opinion suggests, encompass 'all orders' entered pursuant to \u00a7 242(b) proceedings; it is limited to 'final orders of deportation.' The textual difficulty, with which the dissenting opinion does not deal, is that the order in question here neither is a final order of deportation, nor is it, as was the order in Foti, 'made during the same proceedings' in which a final order of deportation has been issued. 375 U.S., at 224, 84 S.Ct. at 311. This cannot be overcome merely by examination of the meaning of the word 'pursuant.'\n\n\n12\n The special inquiry officer's decision, which established deportability and granted voluntary departure, was issued on March 3, 1966. Petitioner filed his application for a stay on June 20, 1966. The application was evidently denied on the same day.\n\n\n13\n See 375 U.S., at 223\u2014224, 84 S.Ct. at 310\u2014311.\n\n\n14\n The Immigration Service has argued that the limiting language in \u00a7 106(a) may be explained by Congress' wish to restrict its application to deportation cases, preventing its application to questions arising from exclusion proceedings. We have found nothing in the pertinent legislative history that offers meaningful support to this view.\n\n\n15\n Note, e.g., the apparent exclusion from \u00a7 106(a) of orders entered under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1282(b). See generally supra, n. 11.\n\n\n16\n We intimate no views on the possibility that a court of appeals might have 'pendent jurisdiction' over denials of discretionary relief, where it already has before it a petition for review from a proceeding conducted under \u00a7 242(b). See Foti v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, supra, 375 U.S. at 227, n. 14, 84 S.Ct. at 313.\n\n\n17\n The opinion of the Court emphasized, in addition, that '(c)learly, changes in administrative procedures may affect the scope and content of various types of agency orders and thus the subject matter embraced in a judicial proceeding to review such orders.' Id., at 230, n. 16, 84 S.Ct. at 314.\n\n\n18\n Brief for Respondent, No. 28, October Term 1963, at 53.\n\n\n19\n See 8 CFR \u00a7 242.22. If, however, the order of the special inquiry officer is appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, a subsequent motion to reopen or reconsider is presented to the Board for disposition. Ibid. The motion in Giova was presented to the Board and decided by it.\n\n\n*\n Merriam-Webster, Webster's New International Dictionary, Second Edition, unabridged (1957), defines 'pursuant' as:\n'1.

{"text":"426 U.S. 229\n96 S.Ct. 2040\n48 L.Ed.2d 597\nWalter E. WASHINGTON, etc., et al., Petitioners,v.Alfred E. DAVIS et al.\nNo. 74-1492.\nArgued March 1, 1976.\nDecided June 7, 1976.\n\nSyllabus\nRespondents Harley and Sellers, both Negroes (hereinafter respondents), whose applications to become police officers in the District of Columbia had been rejected, in an action against District of Columbia officials (petitioners) and others, claimed that the Police Department's recruiting procedures, including a written personnel test (Test 21), were racially discriminatory and violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, and D.C.Code \u00a7 1-320. Test 21 is administered generally to prospective Government employees to determine whether applicants have acquired a particular level of verbal skill. Respondents contended that the test bore no relationship to job performance and excluded a disproportionately high number of Negro applicants. Focusing solely on Test 21, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The District Court, noting the absence of any claim of intentional discrimination, found that respondents' evidence supporting their motion warranted the conclusions that (a) the number of black police officers, while substantial, is not proportionate to the city's population mix; (b) a higher percentage of blacks fail the test than whites; and (c) the test has not been validated to establish its reliability for measuring subsequent job performance. While that showing sufficed to shift the burden of proof to the defendants in the action, the court concluded that respondents were not entitled to relief, and granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment, in view of the facts that 44% Of new police recruits were black, a figure proportionate to the blacks on the total force and equal to the number of 20- to 29-year-old blacks in the recruiting area; that the Police Department had affirmatively sought to recruit blacks, many of whom passed the test but failed to report for duty; and that the test was a useful indicator of training school performance (precluding the need to show validation in terms of job performance) and was not designed to, and did not, discriminate against otherwise qualified blacks. Respondents on appeal contended that their summary judgment motion (which was based solely on the contention that Test 21 invidiously discriminated against Negroes in violation of the Fifth Amendment) should have been granted. The Court of Appeals reversed, and directed summary judgment in favor of respondents, having applied to the constitutional issue the statutory standards enunciated in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158, which held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, prohibits the use ofests that operate to exclude members of minority groups, unless the employer demonstrates that the procedures are substantially related to job performance. The court held that the lack of discriminatory intent in the enactment and administration of Test 21 was irrelevant; that the critical fact was that four times as many blacks as whites failed the test; and that such disproportionate impact sufficed to establish a constitutional violation, absent any proof by petitioners that the test adequately measured job performance. Held:\n1. The Court of Appeals erred in resolving the Fifth Amendment issue by applying standards applicable to Title VII cases. Pp. 238-248.\n(a) Though the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment contains an equal protection component prohibiting the Government from invidious discrimination, it does not follow that a law or other official act is unconstitutional Solely because it has a racially disproportionate impact regardless of whether it reflects a racially discriminatory purpose. Pp. 239-245.\n(b) The Constitution does not prevent the Government from seeking through Test 21 modestly to upgrade the communicative abilities of its employees rather than to be satisfied with some lower level of competence, particularly where the job requires special abilities to communicate orally and in writing; and respondents, as Negroes, could no more ascribe their failure to pass the test to denial of equal protection than could whites who also failed. Pp. 245-246.\n(c) The disproportionate impact of Test 21, which is neutral on its face, does not warrant the conclusion that the test was a purposely discriminatory device, and on the facts before it the District Court properly held that any inference of discrimination was unwarranted. P. 246.\n(d) The rigorous statutory standard of Title VII involves a more probing judicial review of, and less deference to, the seemingly reasonable acts of administrators and executives than is appropriate under the Constitution where, as in this case, special racial impact but no discriminatory purpose is claimed. Any extension of that statutory standard should await legislative prescription. Pp. 246-248.\n2. Statutory standards similar to those obtaining under Title VII were also satisfied here. The District Court's conclusion that Test 21 was directly related to the requirements of the police training program and that a positive relationship between the test and that program was sufficient to validate the test (wholly aside from its possible relationship to actual performance as a police officer) is fully supported on the record in this case, and no remand to establish further validation is appropriate.

Sobol, Washington, D. C., for respondents Davis et al.\nMr. Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis case involves the validity of a qualifying test administered to applicants for positions as police officers in the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department. The test was sustained by the District Court but invalidated by the Court of Appeals. We are in agreement with the District Court and hence reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n2\n* This action began on April 10, 1970, when two Negro police officers filed suit against the then Commissioner of the District of Columbia, the Chief of the District's Metropolitan Police Department, and the Commissioners of the United States Civil Service Commission.1 An amended complaint, filed December 10, alleged that the promotion policies of the Department were racially discriminatory and sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction. The respondents Harley and Sellers were permitted to intervene, their amended complaint asserting that their applications to become officers in the Department had been rejected, and that the Department's recruiting procedures discriminated on the basis of race against black applicants by a series of practices including, but not limited to, a written personnel test which excluded a disproportionately high number of Negro applicants. These practices were asserted to violate respondents' rights \"under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and under D.C.Code \u00a7 1-320.\"2 Defendants answered, and discovery and various other proceedings followed.3Respondents then filed a motion for partial summary judgment with respect to the recruiting phase of the case, seeking a declaration that the test administered to those applying to become police officers is \"unlawfully discriminatory and thereby in violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment . . . .\" No issue under any statute or regulation was raised by the motion. The District of Columbia defendants, petitioners here, and the federal parties also filed motions for summary judgment with respect to the recruiting aspects of the case, asserting that respondents were entitled to relief on neither constitutional nor statutory grounds.4 The District Court granted petitioners' and denied respondents' motions. 348 F.Supp. 15 (DC1972).\n\n\n3\nAccording to the findings and conclusions of the District Court, to be accepted by the Department and to enter an intensive 17-week training program, the police recruit was required to satisfy certain physical and character standards, to be a high school graduate or its equivalent, and to receive a grade of at least 40 out of 80 on \"Test 21,\" which is \"an examination that is used generally throughout the federal service,\" which \"was developed by the Civil Service Commission, not the Police Department,\" and which was \"designed to test verbal ability, vocabulary, reading and comprehension.\" Id., at 16.\n\n\n4\nThe validity of Test 21 was the sole issue before the court on the motions for summary judgment. The District Court noted that there was no claim of \"an intentional discrimination or purposeful discriminatory acts\" but only a claim that Test 21 bore no relationship to job performance and \"has a highly discriminatory impact in screening out black candidates.\" Ibid. Respondents' evidence, the District Court said, warranted three conclusions: \"(a) The number of black police officers, while substantial, is not proportionate to the population mix of the city. (b) A higher percentage of blacks fail the Test than whites. (c) The Test has not been validated to establish its reliability for measuring subsequent job performance.\" Ibid. This showing was deemed sufficient to shift the burden of proof to the defendants in the action, petitioners here; but the court nevertheless concluded that on the undisputed facts respondents were not entitled to relief. The District Court relied on several factors. Since August 1969, 44% Of new police force recruits had been black; that figure also represented the proportion of blacks on the total force and was roughly equivalent to 20- to 29-year-old blacks in the 50-mile radius in which the recruiting efforts of the Police Department had been concentrated. It was undisputed that the Department had systematically and affirmatively sought to enroll black officers many of whom passed the test but failed to report for duty. The District Court rejected the assertion that Test 21 was culturally slanted to favor whites and was \"satisfied that the undisputable facts prove the test to be reasonably and directly related to the requirements of the police recruit training program and that it is neither so designed nor operates (Sic ) to discriminate against otherwise qualified blacks' Id., at 17. It was thus not necessary to show that Test 21 was not only a useful indicator of training school performance but had also been validated in terms of job performance \"The lack of job performance validation does not defeat the Test, given its direct relationship to recruiting and the valid part it plays in this process.\" Ibid. The District Court ultimately concluded that \"(t)he proof is wholly lacking that a police officer qualifies on the color of his skin rather than ability\" and that the Department \"should not be required on this showing to lower standards or to abandon efforts to achieve excellence.\"5 Id., at 18.\n\n\n5\nHaving lost on both constitutional and statutory issues in the District Court, respondents brought the case to the Court of Appeals claiming that their summary judgment motion, which rested on purely constitutional grounds, should have been granted. The tendered constitutional issue was whether the use of Test 21 invidiously discriminated against Negroes and hence denied them due process of law contrary to the commands of the Fifth Amendment. The Court of Appeals, addressing that issue, announced that it would be guided by Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971), a case involving the interpretation and application of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and held that the statutory standards elucidated in that case were to govern the due process question tendered in this one.6 168 U.S.App.D.C. 42, 512 F.2d 956 (1975). e court went on to declare that lack of discriminatory intent in designing and administering Test 21 was irrelevant; the critical fact was rather that a far greater proportion of blacks four times as many failed the test than did whites. This disproportionate impact, standing alone and without regard to whether it indicated a discriminatory purpose, was held sufficient to establish a constitutional violation, absent proof by petitioners that the test was an adequate measure of job performance in addition to being an indicator of probable success in the training program, a burden which the court ruled petitioners had failed to discharge. That the Department had made substantial efforts to recruit blacks was held beside the point and the fact that the racial distribution of recent hirings and of the Department itself might be roughly equivalent to the racial makeup of the surrounding community, broadly conceived, was put aside as a \"comparison (not) material to this appeal.\" Id., at 46 n. 24, 512 F.2d, at 960 n. 24. The Court of Appeals, over a dissent, accordingly reversed the judgment of the District Court and directed that respondents' motion for partial summary judgment be granted. We granted the petition for certiorari, 423 U.S. 820, 96 S.Ct. 33, 46 L.Ed.2d 37 (1975), filed by the District of Columbia officials.7\n\nII\n\n6\nBecause the Court of Appeals erroneously applied the legal standards applicable to Title VII cases in resolving the constitutional issue before it, we reverse its judgment in respondents' favor. Although the petition for certiorari did not present this ground for reversal,8 our Rule 40(1)(d)(2) provides that we \"may notice a plain error not presented\";9 and this is an appropriate occasion to invoke the Rule.\n\n\n7\nAs the Court of Appeals understood Title VII,10 employees or applicants proceeding under it need not concern themselves with the employer's possibly discriminatory purpose but instead may focus solely on the racially differential impact of the challenged hiring or promotion practices. This is not the constitutional rule. We have never held that the constitutional standard for adjudicating claims of invidious racial discrimination is identical to the standards applicable under Title VII, and we decline to do so today.\n\n\n8\nThe central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is the prevention of official conduct discriminating on the basis of race. It is also true that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment contains an equal protection component prohibiting the United States from invidiously discriminating between individuals or groups. Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954). But our cases have not embraced the proposition that a law or other official act, without regard to whether it reflects a racially discriminatory purpose, is unconstitutional Solely because it has a racially disproportionate impact.\n\n\n9\nAlmost 100 years ago, Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 25 L.Ed. 664 (1880), established that the exclusion of Negroes from grand and petit juries in criminal proceedings violated the Equal Protection Clause, but the fact that a particular jury or a series of juries does not statistically reflect the racial composition of the community does not in itself make out an invidious discrimination forbidden by the Clause. \"A purpose to discriminate must be present which may be proven by systematic exclusion of eligible jurymen of the proscribed race or by unequal application of the law to such an extent as to show intentional discrimination.\" Akins v. Texas, 325 U.S. 398, 403-404, 65 S.Ct. 1276, 1279, 89 L.Ed. 1692, 1696 (1945). A defendant in a criminal case is entitled \"to require that the State not deliberately and systematically deny to members of his race the right to participate as jurors in the administration of justice.\" Alexander v. Louisiana, 405 U.S. 625, 628-629, 92 S.Ct. 1221, 1224, 31 L.Ed.2d 536 (1972). See also Carter v. Jury Comm'n, 396 U.S. 320, 335337, 339, 90 S.Ct. 5, 526-528, 529, 24 L.Ed.2d 549, 560-561, 562 (1970); Cassell v. Texas, 339 U.S. 282, 287-290, 70 S.Ct. 629, 631-633, 94 L.Ed. 839, 847-849 (1950); Patton v. Mississippi, 332 U.S. 463, 468-469, 68 S.Ct. 184, 187, 92 L.Ed. 76, 80 (1947).\n\n\n10\nThe rule is the same in other contexts. Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 603, 11 L.Ed.2d 512 (1964), upheld a New York congressional apportionment statute against claims that district lines had been racially gerrymandered. The challenged districts were made up predominantly of whites or of minority races, and their boundaries were irregularly drawn. The challengers did not prevail because they failed to prove that the New York Legislature \"was either motivated by racial considerations or in fact drew the districts on racial lines\"; the plaintiffs had not shown that the statute \"was the product of a state contrivance to segregate on the basis of race or place of origin.\" Id., at 56, 58, 84 S.Ct., at 605, 11 L.Ed.2d, at 515. The dissenters were in agreement that the issue was whether the \"boundaries . . . were purposefully drawn on racial lines.\" Id., at 67, 84 S.Ct., at 611, 11 L.Ed.2d, at 522.\n\n\n11\nThe school desegregation cases have also adhered to the basic equal protection principle that the invidious quality of a law claimed to be racially discriminatory must ultimately be traced to a racially discriminatory purpose. That there are both predominantly black and predominantly white schools in a community is not alone violative of the Equal Protection Clause. The essential element of De jure segregation is \"a current condition of segregation resulting from intentional state action. Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 205, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 2696, 37 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973). The differentiating factor between De jure segregation and so-called De facto segregation . . . is Purpose or Intent to segregate.\" Id., at 208, 93 S.Ct., at 2696, 37 L.Ed.2d, at 561. See also Id., at 199, 211, 213, 93 S.Ct. at 2692, 2698, 2699, 37 L.Ed.2d, at 558, 564, 566. The Court has also recently rejected allegations of racial discrimination based solely on the statistically disproportionate racial impact of various provisions of the Social Security Act because \"(t)he acceptance of appellants' constitutional theory would render suspect each difference in treatment among the grant classes, however lacking in racial motivation and however otherwise rational the treatment might be.\" Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U.S. 535, 548, 92 S.Ct. 1724, 1732, 32 L.Ed.2d 285, 297 (1972). And compare Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385, 89 S.Ct. 557, 21 L.Ed.2d 616 (1969), with James v. Valtierra, 402 U.S. 137, 91 S.Ct. 1331, 28 L.Ed.2d 678 (1971).\n\n\n12\nThis is not to say that the necessary discriminatory racial purpose must be express or appear on the face of the statute, or that a law's disproportionate impact is irrelevant in cases involving Constitution-based claims of racial discrimination. A statute, otherwise neutral on its face, must not be applied so as invidiously to discriminate on the basis of race. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886). It is also clear from the cases dealing with racial discrimination in the selection of juries that the systematic exclusion of Negroes is itself such an \"unequal application of the law . . . as to show intentional discrimination.\" Akins v. Texas, supra, 325 U.S., at 404, 65 S.Ct., at 1279, 89 L.Ed., at 1696. Smith v. Texas, 311 U.S. 128, 61 S.Ct. 164, 85 L.Ed. 84 (1940); Pierre v. Louisiana, 306 U.S. 354, 59 S.Ct. 536, 83 L.Ed. 757 (1939); Neal v. Delaware, 103 U.S. 370, 26 L.Ed. 567 (1881). A prima facie case of discriminatory purpose may be proved as well by the absence of Negroes on a particular jury combined with the failure of the jury commissioners to be informed of eligible Negro jurors in a community, Hill v. Texas, 316 U.S. 400, 404, 62 S.Ct. 1159, 1161, 86 L.Ed. 1559, 1562 (1942), or with racially non-neutral selection procedures, Alexander v. Louisiana, supra ; Avery v. Georgia, 345 U.S. 559, 73 S.Ct. 891, 97 L.Ed. 1244 (1953); Whitus v. Georgia, 385 U.S. 545, 87 S.Ct. 643, 17 L.Ed.2d 599 (1967). With a prima facie case made out, \"the burden of proof shifts to the State to rebut the presumption of unconstitutional action by showing that permissible racially neutral selection criteria and procedures have produced the monochromatic result.\" Alexander, supra, 405 U.S., at 632, 92 S.Ct., at 1226, 31 L.Ed.2d, at 542. See also Turner v. Fouche, 396 U.S. 346, 361, 90 S.Ct. 532, 540, 24 L.Ed.2d 567, 579 (1970); Eubanks v. Louisiana, 356 U.S. 584, 587, 78 S.Ct. 970, 973, 2 L.Ed.2d 991, 994 (1958).\n\n\n13\nNecessarily, an invidious discriminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of the relevant facts, including the fact, if it is true, that the law bears more heavily on one race than another. It is also not infrequently true that the discriminatory impact in the jury cases for example, the total or seriously disproportionate exclusion of Negroes from jury venires may for all practical purposes demonstrate unconstitutionality because in various circumstances the discrimination is very difficult to explain on nonracial grounds. Nevertheless, we have not held that a law, neutral on its face and serving ends otherwise within the power of government to pursue, is invalid under the Equal Protection Clause simply because it may affect a greater proportion of one race than of another. Disproportionate impact is not irrelevant, but it is not the sole touchstone of an invidious racial discrimination forbidden by the Constitution. Standing alone, it does not trigger the rule, McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184, 85 S.Ct. 283, 13 L.Ed.2d 222 (1964), that racial classifications are to be subjected to the strictest scrutiny and are justifiable only by the weightiest of considerations.\n\n\n14\nThere are some indications to the contrary in our cases. In Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217, 91 S.Ct. 1940, 29 L.Ed.2d 438 (1971), the city of Jackson, Miss., following a court decree to this effect, desegregated all of its public facilities save five swimming pools which had been operated by the city and which, following the decree, were closed by ordinance pursuant to a determination by the city council that closure was necessary to preserve peace and order and that integrated pools could not be economically operated. Accepting the finding that the pools were closed to avoid violence and economic loss, this Court rejected the argument that the abandonment of this service was inconsistent with the outstanding desegregation decree and that the otherwise seemingly permissible ends served by the ordinance could be impeached by demonstrating that racially invidious motivations had prompted the city council's action. The holding was that the city was not overtly or covertly operating segregated pools and was extending identical treatment to both whites and Negroes. The opinion warned against grounding decision on legislative purpose or motivation, thereby lending support for the proposition that the operative effect of the law rather than its purpose is the paramount factor. But the holding of the case was that the legitimate purposes of the ordinance to preserve peace and avoid deficits were not open to impeachment by evidence that the councilmen were actually motivated by racial considerations. Whatever dicta the opinion may contain, the decision did not involve, much less invalidate, a statute or ordinary having neutral purposes but disproportionate racial consequences.\n\n\n15\nWright v. Council of City of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 92 S.Ct. 2196, 33 L.Ed.2d 51 (1972), also indicates that in proper circumstances, the racial impact of a law, rather than its discriminatory purpose, is the critical factor. That case involved the division of a school district. The issue was whether the division was consistent with an outstanding order of a federal court to desegregate the dual school system found to have existed in the area. The constitutional predicate for the District Court's invalidation of the divided district was \"the enforcement until 1969 of racial segregation in a public school system of which Emporia had always been a part.\" Id., at 459, 92 S.Ct., at 2202, 33 L.Ed.2d, at 60. There was thus no need to find \"an independent constitutional violation.\" Ibid. Citing Palmer v. Thompson, we agreed with the District Court that the division of the district had the effect of interfering with the federal decree and should be set aside.\n\n\n16\nThat neither Palmer Nor Wright was understood to have changed the prevailing rule is apparent from Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, supra, where the principal issue in litigation was whether to what extent there had been purposeful discrimination resulting in a partially or wholly segregated school system. Nor did other later cases, Alexander v. Louisiana, supra, and Jefferson v. Hackney, supra, indicate that either Palmer or Wright had worked a fundamental change in equal protection law.11\n\n\n17\nBoth before and after Palmer v. Thompson, however, various Courts of Appeals have held in several contexts, including public employment, that the substantially disproportionate racial impact of a statute or official practice standing alone and without regard to discriminatory purpose, suffices to prove racial discrimination violating the Equal Protection Clause absent some justification going substantially beyond what would be necessary to validate most other legislative classifications.12 The cases impressively demonstrate that there is another side to the issue; but, with all due respect, to the extent that those cases rested on or expressed the view that proof of discriminatory racial purpose is unnecessary in making out an equal protection violation, we are in disagreement.\n\n\n18\nAs an initial matter, we have difficulty understanding how a law establishing a racially neutral qualification for employment is nevertheless racially discriminatory and denies \"any person . . . equal protection of the laws\" simply because a greater proportion of Negroes fail to qualify than members of other racial or ethnic groups. Had respondents, along with all others who had failed Test 21, whether white or black, brought an action claiming that the test denied each of them equal protection of the laws as compared with those who had passed with high enough scores to qualify them as police recruits, it is most unlikely that their challenge would have been sustained. Test 21, which is administered generally to prospective Government employees, concededly seeks to ascertain whether those who take it have acquired a particular level of verbal skill; and it is untenable that the Constitution prevents the Government from seeking modestly to upgrade the communicative abilities of its employees rather than to be satisfied with some lower level of competence, particularly where the job requires special ability to communicate orally and in writing. Respondents, as Negroes, could no more successfully claim that the test denied them equal protection than could white applicants who also failed. The conclusion would not be different in the face of proof that more Negroes than whites had been disqualified by Test 21. That other Negroes also failed to score well would, alone, not demonstrate that respondents individually were being denied equal protection of the laws by the application of an otherwise valid qualifying test being administered to prospective police recruits.\n\n\n19\nNor on the facts of the case before us would the disproportionate impact of Test 21 warrant the conclusion that it is a purposeful device to discriminate against Negroes and hence an infringement of the constitutional rights of respondents as well as other black applicants. As we have said, the test is neutral on its face and rationally may be said to serve a purpose the Government is constitutionally empowered to pursue. Even agreeing with the District Court that the differential racial effect of Test 21 called for further inquiry, we think the District Court correctly held that the affirmative efforts of the Metropolitan Police Department to recruit black officers, the changing racial composition of the recruit classes and of the force in general, and the relationship of the test to the training program negated any inference that the Department discriminated on the basis of race or that \"a police officer qualifies on the color of his skin rather than ability.\" 348 F.Supp., at 18.\n\n\n20\nUnder Title VII, Congress provided that when hiring and promotion practices disqualifying substantially disprortionate numbers of blacks are challenged, discriminatory purpose need not be proved, and that it is an insufficient response to demonstrate some rational basis for the challenged practices. It is necessary, in addition, that they be \"validated\" in terms of job performance in any one of several ways, perhaps by ascertaining the minimum skill, ability, or potential necessary for the position at issue and determining whether the qualifying tests are appropriate for the selection of qualified applicants for the job in question.13 However this process proceeds, it involves a more probing judicial review of, and less deference to, the seemingly reasonable acts of administrators and executives than is appropriate under the Constitution where special racial impact, without discriminatory purpose, is claimed. We are not disposed to adopt this more rigorous standard for the purposes of applying the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments in cases such as this\n\n\n21\nA rule that a statute designed to serve neutral ends is nevertheless invalid, absent compelling justification, if in practice it benefits or burdens one race more than another would be far-reaching and would raise serious questions about, and perhaps invalidate, a whole range of tax, welfare, public service, regulatory, and licensing statutes that may be more burdensome to the poor and to the average black than to the more affluent white.14\n\n\n22\nGiven that rule, such consequences would perhaps be likely to follow. However, in our view, extension of the rule beyond those areas where it is already applicable by reason of statute, such as in the field of public employment, should await legislative prescription.\n\n\n23\nAs we have indicated, it was error to direct summary judgment for respondents based on the Fifth Amendment.\n\nIII\n\n24\nWe also hold that the Court of Appeals should have affirmed the judgment of the District Court granting the motions for summary judgment filed by petitioners and the federal parties. Respondents were entitled to relief on neither constitutional nor statutory grounds.\n\n\n25\nThe submission of the defendants in the District Court was that Test 21 complied with all applicable statutory as well as constitutional requirements; and they appear not to have disputed that under the statutes and regulations governing their conduct standards similar to those obtaining under Title VII had to be satisfied.15 The District Court also assumed that Title VII standards were to control the case identified the determinative issue as whether Test 21 was sufficiently job related and proceeded to uphold use of the test because it was \"directly related to a determination of whether the applicant possesses sufficient skills requisite to the demands of the curriculum a recruit must master at the police academy.\" 348 F.Supp., at 17. The Court of Appeals reversed because the relationship between Test 21 and training school success, if demonstrated at all, did not satisfy what it deemed to be the crucial requirement of a direct relationship between performance on Test 21 and performance on the policeman's job.\n\n\n26\nWe agree with petitioners and the federal parties that this was error. The advisability of the police recruit training course informing the recruit about his upcoming job, acquainting him with its demands, and attempting to impart a modicum of required skills seems conceded. It is also apparent to us, as it was to the District Judge, that some minimum verbal and communicative skill would be very useful, if not essential, to satisfactory progress in the training regimen. Based on the evidence before him, the District Judge concluded that Test 21 was directly related to the requirements of the police training program and that a positive relationship between the test and training-course performance was sufficient to validate the former, wholly aside from its possible relationship to actual performance as a police officer. This conclusion of the District Judge that training-program validation may itself be sufficient is supported by regulations of the Civil Service Commission, by the opinion evidence placed before the District Judge, and by the current views of the Civil Service Commissioners who were parties to the case.16 Nor is the conclusion closed by either Griggs or Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975); and it seems to us the much more sensible construction of the job-relatedness requirement.\n\n\n27\nThe District Court's accompanying conclusion that Test 21 was in fact directly related to the requirements of the police training program was supported by a validation study, as well as by other evidence of record;17 and we are not convinced that this conclusion was erroneous.\n\n\n28\nThe federal parties, whose views have somewhat changed since the decision of the Court of Appeals and who still insist that training-program validation is sufficient, now urge a remand to the District Court for the purpose of further inquiry into whether the training-program test scores, which were found to correlate with Test 21 scores, are themselves an appropriate measure of the trainee's mastership of the material taught in the course and whether the training program itself is sufficiently related to actual performance of the police officer's task. We think a remand is inappropriate. The District Court's judgment was warranted by the record before it, and we perceive no good reason to reopen it, particularly since we were informed at oral argument that although Test 21 is still being administered, the training program itself has undergone substantial modification in the course of this litigation. If there are now deficiencies in the recruiting practices under prevailing Title VII standards, those deficiencies are to be directly addressed in accordance with appropriate procedures mandated under that Title.\n\n\n29\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals accordingly is reversed.\n\n\n30\nSo ordered.\n\n\n31\nMr. Justice STEWART joins Parts I and II of the Court's opinion.\n\n\n32\nMr. Justice STEVENS, concurring.\n\n\n33\nWhile I agree with the Court's disposition of this case, I add these comments on the constitutional issue discussed in Part II and the statutory issue discussed in Part III of the Court's opinion.\n\n\n34\nThe requirement of purposeful discrimination is a common thread running through the cases summarized in Part II. These cases include criminal convictions which were set aside because blacks were excluded from the grand jury, a reapportionment case in which political boundaries were obviously influenced to some extent by racial considerations, a school desegregation case, and a case involving the unequal administration of an ordinance purporting to prohibit the operation of laundries in frame buildings. Although it may be proper to use the same language to describe the constitutional claim in each of these contexts, the burden of proving a prima facie case may well involve differing evidentiary considerations. The extent of deference that one pays to the trial court's determination of the factual issue, and indeed, the extent to which one characterizes the intent issue as a question of fact or a question of law, will vary in different contexts.\n\n\n35\nFrequently the most probative evidence of intent will be objective evidence of what actually happened rather than evidence describing the subjective state of mind of the actor. For normally the actor is presumed to have intended the natural consequences of his deeds. This is particularly true in the case of governmental action which is frequently the product of compromise, of collective decisionmaking, and of mixed motivation. It is unrealistic, on the one hand, to require the victim of alleged discrimination to uncover the actual subjective intent of the decisionmaker or, conversely, to invalidate otherwise legitimate action simply because an improper motive affected the deliberation of a participant in the decisional process. A law conscripting clerics should not be invalidated because an atheist voted for it.\n\n\n36\nMy point in making this observation is to suggest that the line between discriminatory purpose and discriminatory impact is not nearly as bright, and perhaps not quite as critical, as the reader of the Court's opinion might assume. I agree, of course, that a constitutional issue does not arise every time some disproportionate impact is shown. On the other hand, when the disproportion is as dramatic as in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110 or Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886), it really does not matter whether the standard is phrased in terms of purpose or effect. Therefore, although I accept the statement of the general rule in the Court's opinion, I am not yet prepared to indicate how that standard should be applied in the many cases which have formulated the governing standard in different language.*\n\n\n37\nMy agreement with the conclusion reached in Part II of the Court's opinion rests on a ground narrower than the Court describes. I do not rely at all on the evidence of good-faith efforts to recruit black police officers. In my judgment, neither those efforts nor the subjective good faith of the District administration, would save Test 21 if it were otherwise invalid.\n\n\n38\nThere are two reasons why I am convinced that the challenge to Test 21 is insufficient. First, the test serves the neutral and legitimate purpose of requiring all applicants to meet a uniform minimum standard of literacy. Reading ability is manifestly relevant to the police function, there is no evidence that the required passing grade was set at an arbitrarily high level, and there is sufficient disparity among high schools and high school graduates to justify the use of a separate uniform test. Second, the same test is used throughout the federal service. The applicants for employment in the District of Columbia Police Department represent such a small fraction of the total number of persons who have taken the test that their experience is of minimal probative value in assessing the neutrality of the test itself. That evidence, without more, is not sufficient to overcome the presumption that a test which is this widely used by the Federal Government is in fact neutral in its effect as well as its \"purposes\" that term is used in constitutional adjudication.\n\n\n39\nMy study of the statutory issue leads me to the same conclusion reached by the Court in Part III of its opinion. Since the Court of Appeals set aside the portion of the District Court's summary judgment granting the defendants' motion, I agree that we cannot ignore the statutory claims even though as the Court makes clear, Ante, at 238 n.10, there is not Title VII question in this case. The actual statutory holdings are limited to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and \u00a7 1-320 of the District of Columbia Code, to which regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have no direct application.\n\n\n40\nThe parties argued the case as though Title VII standards were applicable. In a general way those standards shed light on the issues, but there is sufficient individuality and complexity to that statute, and to the regulations promulgated under it, to make it inappropriate simply to transplant those standards in their entirety into a different statutory scheme having a different history. Moreover, the subject matter of this case the validity of qualifications for the law enforcement profession is one in which federal district judges have a greater expertise than in many others. I therefore do not regard this as a case in which the District Court was required to apply Title VII standards as strictly as would be necessary either in other contexts or in litigation actually arising under that statute.\n\n\n41\nThe Court's specific holding on the job-relatedness question contains, I believe, two components. First, as a matter of law, it is permissible for the police department to use a test for the purpose of predicting ability to master a training program even if the test does not otherwise predict ability to perform on the job. I regard this as a reasonable proposition and not inconsistent with the Court's prior holdings, although some of its prior language obviously did not contemplate this precise problem. Second, as a matter of fact, the District Court's finding that there was a correlation between success on the test and success in the training program has sufficient evidentiary support to withstand attack under the \"clearly erroneous\" standard mandated by Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 52(a). Whether or not we would have made the same finding of fact, the opinion evidence identified in n. 17 of the Court's opinion and indeed the assumption made by the Court of Appeals quoted therein is surely adequate to support the finding under the proper standard of appellate review.\n\n\n42\nOn the understanding that nothing which I have said is inconsistent with the Court's reasoning, I join the opinion of the Court except to the extent that it expresses an opinion on the merits of the cases cited Ante, at 244-245, n. 12.\n\n\n43\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting.\n\n\n44\nThe Court holds that the job qualification examination (Test 21) given by the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department does not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race under either constitutional or statutory standards.\n\n\n45\nInitially, it seems to me that the Court should not pass on the statutory questions, because they are not presented by this case. The Court says that respondents' summary judgment motion \"rested on purely constitutional grounds,\" Ante, at 236, and that \"the Court of Appeals erroneously applied the legal standards applicable to Title VII cases in resolving the constitutional issue before it,\" Ante, at 238. There is a suggestion, however, that petitioners are entitled to prevail because they met the burden of proof imposed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304. Ante, at 249 n. 15. As I understand the opinion, the Court therefore holds that Test 21 is job-related under \u00a7 3304, but not necessarily under Title VII. But that provision, by the Court's own analysis, is no more in the case than Title VII; respondents' \"complaint asserted no claim under \u00a7 3304.\" Ante, at 234 n. 2. Cf. Ante, at 238 n. 10. If it was \"plain error\" for the Court of Appeals to apply a statutory standard to this case, as the Court asserts, Ante, at 238-239, then it is unfortunate that the Court does not recognize that it is also plain error to address the statutory issues in Part III of its opinion.\n\n\n46\nNevertheless, although it appears unnecessary to reach the statutory questions, I will accept the Court's conclusion that respondents were entitled to summary judgment if they were correct in their statutory arguments, and I would affirm the Court of Appeals because petitioners have failed to prove that Test 21 satisfies the applicable statutory standards.1 All parties' arguments and both lower court decisions were based on Title VII standards. In this context, I think it wrong to focus on \u00a7 3304 to the exclusion of the Title VII standards, particularly because the Civil Service Commission views the job-relatedness standards of Title VII and \u00a7 3304 as identical.2 See also Infra, at 263.\n\n\n47\nIn applying a Title VII test,3 both the District Court and the Court of Appeals held that respondents had offered sufficient evidence of discriminatory impact to shift to petitioners the burden of proving job relatedness. 348 F.Supp. 15, 16; 168 U.S.App.D.C. 42, 45-47, 512 F.2d 956, 959-961. The Court does not question these rulings, and the only issue before us is what petitioners were required to show and whether they carried their burden. The Court agrees with the District Court's conclusion that Test 21 was validated by a positive relationship between Test 21 scores and performance in police training courses. This result is based upon the Court's reading of the record, its interpretation of instructions governing testing practices issued by the Civil Service Commission (CSC), and \"the current views of the Civil Service Commissioners who were parties to the case.\" We are also assured that today's result is not foreclosed by Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971), and Albermarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975). Finally, the Court asserts that its conclusion is \"the much more sensible construction of the job relatedness requirement.\" Ante, at 251.\n\n\n48\nBut the CSC instructions cited by the Court do not support the District Court's conclusion. More importantly, the brief filed in this Court by the CSC takes the position that petitioners did not satisfy the burden of proof imposed by the CSC guidelines. It also appears that longstanding regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) previously endorsed by this Court require a result contrary to that reached by the Court. Furthermore, the Court's conclusion is inconsistent with my understanding of the interpretation of Title VII in Griggs and Albemarle. I do not find this conclusion \"much more sensible\" and with all respect I suggest that today's decision has the potential of significantly weakening statutory safeguards against discrimination in employment.\n\n\n49\n* On October 12, 1972, the CSC issued a supplement to the Federal Personnel Manual containing instructions for compliance with its general regulations concerning employment practices.4 The provision cited by the Court requires that Test 21 \"have a demonstrable and rational relationship to important job-related performance objectives identified by management.\" \"Success in training\" is one example of a possible objective. The statistical correlation established by the Futransky validity study, Ante, at 251 n. 17, was between applicants' scores on Test 21 and recruits' average scores on final examinations given during the police training course.\n\n\n50\nIt is hornbook law that the Court accord deference to the construction of an administrative regulation when that construction is made by the administrative authority responsible for the regulation. E. g., Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616, 625 (1965). It is worthy of note, therefore, that the brief filed by the CSC in this case interprets the instructions in a manner directly contrary to the Court, despite the Court's claim that its result is supported by the Commissioners' \"current views.\"\n\n\n51\n\"Under Civil Service Commission regulations and current      professional standards governing criterion-related test      validation procedures, the job-relatedness of an entrance      examination may be demonstrated by proof that scores on the      examination predict properly measured success in job-relevant      training (regardless of whether they predict success on the      job itself).\n\n\n52\n\"The documentary evidence submitted in the district court      demonstrates that scores on Test 21 are predictive of Recruit      School Final Averages. There is little evidence, however, concerning the relationship      between the Recruit School tests and the substance of the      training program, and between the substance of the training      program and the post-training job of a police officer. It      cannot be determined, therefore, whether the Recruit School      Final Averages are a proper measure of success in training      and whether the training program is job-relevant.\" Brief for      CSC 14-15 (emphasis added).\n\n\n53\nThe CSC maintains that a positive correlation between scores on entrance examinations and the criterion of success in training may establish the job relatedness of an entrance test thus relieving an employer from the burden of providing a relationship to job performance after training but only subject to certain limitations.\n\n\n54\n\"Proof that scores on an entrance examination predict scores      on training school achievement tests, however, does not, by      itself, satisfy the burden of demonstrating the      job-relatedness of the entrance examination. There must also      be evidence the nature of which will depend on the particular      circumstances of the case showing that the achievement test      scores are an appropriate measure of the trainee's mastery of      the material taught in the training program and that the      training program imparts to a new employee knowledge, skills,      or abilities required for performance of the post-training      job.\" Id., at 24-25.\n\n\n55\nApplying its standards5 the CSC concludes that none of the evidence presented in the District Court established \"the appropriateness of using Recruit School Final Averages as the measure of training performance or the relationship of the Recruit School program to the job of a police officer.\" Id., at 30.6\n\n\n56\nThe CSC's standards thus recognize that Test 21 can be validated by a correlation between Test 21 scores and recruits' averages on training examinations only if (1) the training averages predict job performance or (2) the averages are proved to measure performance in job-related training. There is no proof that the recruits' average is correlated with job performance after completion of training. See n. 10, Infra. And although a positive relationship to the recruits' average might be sufficient to validate Test 21 if the average were proved to reflect mastery of material on the training curriculum that was in turn demonstrated to be relevant to job performance, the record is devoid of proof in this regard. First, there is no demonstration by petitioners that the training-course examinations measure comprehension of the training curriculum; indeed, these examinations do not even appear in the record. Furthermore, the Futransky study simply designated an average of 85 on the examination as a \"good\" performance and assumed that a recruit with such an average learned the material taught in the training course.7 Without any further proof of the significance of a score of 85, and there is none in the record, I cannot agree that Test 21 is predictive of \"success in training.\"\n\nII\n\n57\nToday's decision is also at odds with EEOC regulations issued pursuant to explicit authorization in Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-12(a). Although the dispute in this case is not within the EEOC's jurisdiction, as I noted above, the proper construction of Title VII nevertheless is relevant. Moreover, the 1972 extension of Title VII to public employees gave the same substantive protection to those employees as had previously been accorded in the private sector, Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 546-547, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 2480-2481, 41 L.Ed.2d 290, 298-299 (1974), and it is therefore improper to maintain different standards in the public and private sectors. Chandler v. Roudebush, 425 U.S. 840, 864, 96 S.Ct. 1949, 1961, 48 L.Ed.2d 416, 433 (1976). See n. 2, Supra.\n\n\n58\nAs with an agency's regulations, the construction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration is entitled to great deference. Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 210, 93 S.Ct. 364, 367, 34 L.Ed.2d 415, 419 (1972); Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S., at 16, 85 S.Ct., at 801, 13 L.Ed.2d, at 625; Power Reactor Co. v. Electricians, 367 U.S. 396, 408, 81 S.Ct. 1529, 1535, 6 L.Ed.2d 924, 932 (1961). The deference due the pertinent EEOC regulations is enhanced by the fact that they were neither altered nor disapproved when Congress extensively amended Title VII in 1972.8 Chemehuevi Tribe of Indians v. FPC, 420 U.S. 395, 410, 95 S.Ct. 1066, 1075, 43 L.Ed.2d 279, 290 (1975); Cammarano v. United States, 358 U.S. 498, 510, 79 S.Ct. 524, 531, 3 L.Ed.2d 462, 470 (1959); Allen v. Grand Central Aircraft Co., 347 U.S. 535, 547, 74 S.Ct. 745, 752, 98 L.Ed. 933, 943 (1954); Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. United States, 288 U.S. 269, 273, 53 S.Ct. 337, 339, 77 L.Ed. 739, 742 (1933). These principles were followed in Albemarle where the Court explicitly endorsed various regulations no fewer than eight times in its opinion, 422 U.S., at 431-436, 95 S.Ct., at 2378-2381, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 304-3079 and Griggs, 401 U.S., at 433-434, 91 S.Ct., at 854-855, 28 L.Ed.2d, at 165-166.\n\n\n59\nThe EEOC regulations require that the validity of a job qualification test be proved by \"empirical data demonstrating that the test is predictive of or significantly correlated with important elements of work behavior which comprise or are relevant to the job or jobs for which candidates are being evaluated.\" 29 CFR \u00a7 1607.4(c) (1975). This construction of Title VII was approved in Albemarle, where we quoted this provision and remarked that \"(t)he message of these Guidelines is the same as that of the Griggs case.\" 422 U.S., at 431, 95 S.Ct., at 2378, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 304. The regulations also set forth minimum standards for validation and delineate the criteria that may be used for this purpose.\n\n\n60\n\"The work behaviors or other criteria of employee adequacy      which the test is intended to predict or identify must be      fully described; and, additionally, in the case of rating      techniques, the appraisal form(s) and instructions to the      rater(s) must be included as a part of the validation      evidence. Such criteria may include measures other than      actual work proficiency, such as training time, supervisory      ratings, regularity of attendance and tenure. Whatever      criteria are used they must represent major or critical work      behaviors as revealed by careful job analyses.\" 29 CFR \u00a7      1607.5(b)(3) (1975).\n\n\n61\nThis provision was also approved in Albemarle, 422 U.S., at 432, 95 S.Ct., at 2379, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 304, and n. 30.\n\n\n62\nIf we measure the validity of Test 21 by this standard, which I submit we are bound to do, petitioners' proof is deficient in a number of ways similar to those noted above. First, the criterion of final training examination averages does not appear to be \"fully described.\" Although the record contains some general discussion of the training curriculum, the examinations are not in the record, and there is no other evidence completely elucidating the subject matter tested by the training examinations. Without this required description we cannot determine whether the correlation with training examination averages is sufficiently related to petitioners' need to ascertain \"job-specific ability.\" See Albemarle, 422 U.S., at 433, 95 S.Ct., at 2379, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 305. Second, the EEOC regulations do not expressly permit validation by correlation to training performance, unlike the CSC instructions. Among the specified criteria the closest to training performance is \"training time.\" All recruits to the Metropolitan Police Department, however, go through the same training course in the same amount of time, including those who experience some difficulty. See n. 7, supra. Third, the final requirement of \u00a7 1607.5(b)(3) has not been met. There has been no job analysis establishing the significance of scores on training examinations, nor is there any other type of evidence showing that these scores are of 'major or critical\" importance.\n\n\n63\nAccordingly, EEOC regulations that have previously been approved by the Court set forth a construction of Title VII that is distinctly opposed to today's statutory result.\n\nIII\n\n64\nThe Court also says that its conclusion is not foreclosed by Griggs and Albemarle, but today's result plainly conflicts with those cases. Griggs held that \"(i)f an employment practice which operates to exclude Negroes cannot be shown to be Related to job performance, the practice is prohibited.\" 401 U.S., at 431, 91 S.Ct., at 853, 28 L.Ed.2d, at 164 (emphasis added). Once a discriminatory impact is shown, the employer carries the burden of proving that the challenged practice \"bear(s) a Demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was used.\" Ibid. (emphasis added). We observed further:\n\n\n65\n\"Nothing in the Act precludes the use of testing or measuring      procedures; obviously they are useful. What Congress has      forbidden is giving these devices and mechanisms controlling      force unless they are demonstrably a reasonable measure of      job performance. . . . What Congress has commanded is that      any tests used must measure the person for the job and not      the person in the abstract.\" Id., at 436, 91 S.Ct., at 856,      28 L.Ed.2d, at 167.\n\n\n66\nAlbemarle read Griggs to require that a discriminatory test be validated through proof \"by professionally acceptable methods\" that it is \" 'predictive of or significantly correlated with important elements of work behavior which comprise or are relevant to the job or jobs for which candidates are being evaluated.' \" 422 U.S., at 431, 95 S.Ct., at 2378, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 304 (emphasis added), quoting 29 CFR \u00a7 1607.4(c) (1975). Further, we rejected the employer's attempt to validate a written test by proving that it was related to supervisors' job performance ratings, because there was no demonstration that the ratings accurately reflected job performance. We were unable \"to determine whether the criteria Actually considered were sufficiently related to the (employer's) legitimate interest in job-specific ability to justify a testing system with a racially discriminatory impact.\" 422 U.S., at 433, 95 S.Ct., at 2379, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 305 (emphasis in original). To me, therefore, these cases read Title VII as requiring proof of a significant relationship to job performance to establish the validity of a discriminatory test. See also McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668, 678 and n. 14 (1973). Petitioners do not maintain that there is a demonstrated correlation between Test 21 scores and job performance. Moreover, their validity study was unable to discern a significant positive relationship between training averages and job performance.10 Thus, there is no proof of a correlation either direct or indirect between Test 21 and performance of the job of being a police officer.\n\n\n67\nIt may well be that in some circumstances, proof of a relationship between a discriminatory qualification test and training performance is an acceptable substitute for establishing a relationship to job performance. But this question is not settled, and it should not be resolved by the minimal analysis in the Court's opinion.11 Moreover, it is particularly inappropriate to decide the question on this record. \"Professionally acceptable methods\" apparently recognize validation by proof of a correlation with training performance, rather than of performance, if (1) the training curriculum includes information proved to be important to job performance and (2) the standard used as a measure of training performance is shown to reflect the trainees' mastery of the material included in the training curriculum. See Brief for CSC 24-29; Brief for the Executive Committee of Division 14 of the American Psychological Assn. as Amicus Curiae 37-43. But no authority, whether professional, administrative, or judicial, has accepted the sufficiency of a correlation with training performance in the absence of such proof. For reasons that I have stated above, the record does not adequately establish either factor. As a result, the Court's conclusion cannot be squared with the focus on job performance in Griggs and Albemarle, even if this substitute showing is reconcilable with the holdings in those cases.\n\n\n68\nToday's reduced emphasis on a relationship to job performance is also inconsistent with clearly expressed congressional intent. A section-by-section analysis of the 1972 amendments to Title VII states as follows:\n\n\n69\n\"In any area where the new law does not address itself, or in      any areas where a specific contrary intention is not      indicated, it was assumed that the present case law as      developed by the courts would continue to govern the applicability and construction of      Title VII.\" 118 Cong.Rec. 7166 (1972).\n\n\n70\nThe pre-1972 judicial decisions dealing with standardized tests used as job qualification requirements uniformly follow the EEOC regulations discussed above and insist upon proof of a relationship to job performance to prove that a test is job related.12 Furthermore, the Court ignores Congress' explicit hostility toward the use of written tests as job-qualification requirements; Congress disapproved the CSC's \"use of general ability tests which are not aimed at any direct relationship to specific jobs.\" H.R.Rep. No. 92-238, p. 24 (1971). See S.Rep. No. 92-415, pp. 14-15 (1971). Petitioners concede that Test 21 was devised by the CSC for general use and was not designed to be used by police departments.\n\n\n71\nFinally, it should be observed that every federal court, except the District Court in this case, presented with proof identical to that offered to validate Test 21 has reached a conclusion directly opposite to that of the Court today.13 Sound policy considerations support the view that, at a minimum, petitioners should have been required to prove that the police training examinations either measure job-related skills or predict job performance. Where employers try to validate written qualification tests by proving a correlation with written examinations in a training course, there is a substantial danger that people who have good verbal skills will achieve high scores on both tests due to verbal ability, rather than \"job-specific ability.\" As a result, employers could validate any entrance examination that measures only verbal ability by giving another written test that measures verbal ability at the end of a training course. Any contention that the resulting correlation between examination scores would be evidence that the initial test is \"job related\" is plainly erroneous. It seems to me, however, that the Court's holding in this case can be read as endorsing this dubious proposition. Today's result will prove particularly unfortunate if it is extended to govern Title VII cases.\n\n\n72\nAccordingly, accepting the Court's assertion that it is necessary to reach the statutory issue, I would hold that petitioners have not met their burden of proof and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n\n1\n Under \u00a7 4-103 of the District of Columbia Code, appointments to the Metropolitan Police force were to be made by the Commissioner subject to the provisions of Title 5 of the United States Code relating to the classified civil service. The District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia, established by Reorganization Plan No. 37 of 1967, were abolished as of January 2, 1975, and replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia.\n\n\n2\n Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 provides:\n\"All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.\"\nSection 1-320 of the District of Columbia Code (1973) provides:\n\"In any program of recruitment or hiring of individuals to fill positions in the government of the District of Columbia, no officer or employee of the government of the District of Columbia shall exclude or give preference to the residents of the District of Columbia or any State of the United States on the basis of residence, religion, race, color, or national origin.\"\nOne of the provisions expressly made applicable to the Metropolitan Police force by \u00a7 4-103 is 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304(a), which provides:\n\"s 3304. Competitive service; examinations.\n\"(a) The President may prescribe rules which shall provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for\n\"(1) open, competitive examinations for testing applicants for appointment in the competitive service which are practical in character and as far as possible relate to matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the applicants for the appointment sought; and\n\"(2) noncompetitive examinations when competent applicants do not compete after notice has been given of the existence of the vacancy.\"\nThe complaint asserted no claim under \u00a7 3304.\n\n\n3\n Those proceedings included a hearing on respondents' motion for an order designating the case as a class action. A ruling on the motion was held in abeyance and was never granted insofar as the record before us reveals.\n\n\n4\n In support of the motion, petitioners and the federal parties urged that they were in compliance with all applicable constitutional, statutory, and regulatory provisions, including the provisions of the Civil Service Act which since 1883 were said to have established a \"job relatedness\" standard for employment.\n\n\n5\n When summary judgment was granted, the case with respect to discriminatory promotions was still pending. The District Court, however, made the determination and direction authorized by Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 54(b). The promotion issue was subsequently decided adversely to the original plaintiffs. Davis v. Washington, 352 F.Supp. 187 (DC 1972).\n\n\n6\n \"Although appellants' complaint did not allege a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which then was inapplicable to the Federal Government, decisions applying Title VII furnish additional instruction as to the legal standard governing the issues raised in this case. . . . The many decisions disposing of employment discrimination claims on constitutional grounds have made no distinction between the constitutional standard and the statutory standard under Title VII.\" 168 U.S.App.D.C. 42, 44 n. 2, 512 F.2d 956, 958 n. 2 (1975).\n\n\n7\n The Civil Service Commissioners, defendants in the District Court, did not petition for writ of certiorari but have filed a brief as respondents. See our Rule 21(4). We shall at times refer to them as the \"federal parties.\"\n\n\n8\n Apparently not disputing the applicability of the Griggs and Title VII standards in resolving this case, petitioners presented issues going only to whether Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971), had been misapplied by the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n9\n See, E. g., Silber v. United States, 370 U.S. 717, 82 S.Ct. 1287, 8 L.Ed.2d 798 (1962); Carpenters v. United States, 330 U.S. 395, 412, 67 S.Ct. 775, 784, 91 L.Ed. 973, 987 (1947); Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 16, 61 S.Ct. 422, 427, 85 L.Ed. 479, 486 (1941); Mahler v. Eby, 264 U.S. 32, 45, 44 S.Ct. 283, 288, 68 L.Ed. 549, 557 (1924); Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 362, 30 S.Ct. 544, 547, 54 L.Ed. 793, 796 (1910).\n\n\n10\n Although Title VII standards have dominated this case, the statute was not applicable to federal employees when the complaint was filed; and although the 1972 amendments extending the Title to reach Government employees were adopted prior to the District Court's judgment, the complaint was not amended to state a claim under that Title, nor did the case thereafter proceed as a Title VII case. Respondents' motion for partial summary judgment, filed after the 1972 amendments, rested solely on constitutional grounds; and the Court of Appeals ruled that the motion should have been granted.\nAt the oral argument before this Court, when respondents' counsel was asked whether \"this is just a purely Title VII case as it comes to us from the Court of Appeals without any constitutional overtones,\" counsel responded: \"My trouble honestly with that proposition is the procedural requirements to get into court under Title VII, and this case has not met them.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 66.\n\n\n11\n To the extent that Palmer suggests a generally applicable proposition that legislative purpose is irrelevant in constitutional adjudication, our prior cases as indicated in the text are to the contrary; and very shortly after Palmer, all Members of the Court majority in that case joined the Court's opinion in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971), which dealt with the issue of public financing for private schools and which announced, as the Court had several times before, that the validity of public aid to church-related schools includes close inquiry into the purpose of the challenged statute.\n\n\n12\n Cases dealing with public employment include: Chance v. Board of Examiners, 458 F.2d 1167, 1176-1177 (CA2 1972); Castro v. Beecher, 459 F.2d 725, 732-733 (CA1 1972); Bridgeport Guardians v.

Professional standards developed by the American Psychological Association in its Standards for Educational and Psychological Tests and Manuals (1966), accept three basic methods of validation: \"empirical\" or \"criterion\" validity (demonstrated by identifying criteria that indicate successful job performance and then correlating test scores and the criteria so identified); \"construct\" validity (demonstrated by examinations structured to measure the degree to which job applicants have identifiable characteristics that have been determined to be important in successful job performance); and \"content\" validity (demonstrated by tests whose content closely approximates tasks to be performed on the job by the applicant). These standards have been relied upon by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in fashioning its Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, 29 CFR pt. 1607 (1975), and have been judicially noted in cases where validation of employment tests has been in issue. See, E.g., Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 431, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 2378, 45 L.Ed.2d 280, 304 (1975); Douglas v. Hampton, 168 U.S.App.D.C., at 70, 512 F.2d, at 984; Vulcan Society v. Civil Service Comm'n, 490 F.2d 387, 394 (CA2 1973).\n\n\n14\n Goodman, De Facto School Segregation: A Constitutional and Empirical Analysis, 60 Calif.L.Rev. 275, 300 (1972), suggests that disproportionate-impact analysis might invalidate \"tests and qualifications for voting, draft deferment, public employment, jury service, and other government-conferred benefits and opportunities . . .; (s)ales taxes, bail schedules, utility rates, bridge tolls, license fees, and other state-imposed charges.\" It has also been argued that minimum wage and usury laws as well as professional licensing requirements would require major modifications in light of the unequal-impact rule. Silverman, Equal Protection, Economic Legislation, and Racial Discrimination, 25 Vand.L.Rev. 1183 (1972). See also Demsetz, Minorities in the Market Place, 43 N.C.L.Rev. 271 (1965).\n\n\n15\n In their memorandum supporting their motion for summary judgment, the federal parties argued:\n\"In Griggs, supra, the Supreme Court set a job-relationship standard for the private sector employers which has been a standard for federal employment since the passage of the Civil Service Act in 1883. In that act Congress has mandated that the federal government must use '. . . examinations for testing applicants for appointment . . . which . . . as far as possible relate to matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the applicants for the appointments sought.' 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304(a)(1). Defendants contend that they have been following the job-related standards of Griggs, supra, for the past eighty-eight years by virtue of the enactment of the Civil Service Act which guaranteed open and fair competition for jobs.\"\nThey went on to argue that the Griggs standard had been satisfied. In granting the motions for summary judgment filed by petitioners and the federal parties, the District Court necessarily decided adversely to respondents the statutory issues expressly or tacitly tendered by the parties.\n\n\n16\n See n. 17, Infra. Current instructions of the Civil Service Commission on \"Examining, Testing, Standards, and Employment Practices\" provide in pertinent part:\n\"S2-2 Use of applicant appraisal procedures\na. Policy. The Commission's staff develops and uses applicant appraisal procedures to assess the knowledges, skills, and abilities of persons for jobs and not persons in the abstract.\n\"(1) Appraisal procedures are designed to reflect real, reasonable, and necessary qualifications for effective job behavior.\n\"(2) An appraisal procedure must, among other requirements, have a demonstrable and rational relationship to important job-related performance objectives identified by management, such as:\n\"(a) Effective job performance;\n\"(b) Capability;\n\"(c) Success in training;\n\"(d) Reduced turnover; or\n\"(e) Job satisfaction.\" 37 Fed.Reg. 21557 (1972).\nSee also Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, 29 CFR \u00a7 1607.5(b)(3) (1975), discussed in Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S., at 430-435, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 2378-2380, 45 L.Ed.2d 280, 304-307.\n\n\n17\n The record includes a validation study of Test 21's relationship to performance in the recruit training program. The study was made by D. L. Futransky of the Standards Division, Bureau of Policies and Standards, United States Civil Service Commission. App., at 99-109. Findings of the study included data \"support(ing) the conclusion that T(est) 21 is effective in selecting trainees who can learn the material that is taught at the Recruit School.\" Id., at 103. Opinion evidence, submitted by qualified experts examining the Futransky study and\/or conducting their own research, affirmed the correlation between scores on Test 21 and success in the training program. E. g., Affidavit of Dr. Donald J. Schwartz (personnel research psychologist, United States Civil Service Commission), App. 178, 183 (\"It is my opinion . . . that Test 21 has a significant positive correlation with success in the MPD Recruit School for both Blacks and whites and is therefore shown to be job related . . .\"); affidavit of Diane E. Wilson (personnel research psychologist, United States Civil Service Commission), App. 185, 186 (\"It is my opinion that there is a direct and rational relationship between the content and difficulty of Test 21 and successful completion of recruit school training\").\nThe Court of Appeals was \"willing to assume for purposes of this appeal that appellees have shown that Test 21 is predictive of further progress in Recruit School.\" 168 U.S.App.D.C., at 48, 512 F.2d, at 962.\n\n\n*\n Specifically, I express no opinion on the merits of the cases listed in n. 12 of the Court's opinion.\n\n\n1\n Although I do not intend to address the constitutional questions considered by the Court in Part II of its opinion, I feel constrained to comment upon the propriety of footnote 12, Ante, at 244-245. One of the cases \"disapproved\" therein is presently scheduled for plenary consideration by the Court in the 1976 Term, Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. v. Village of Arlington Heights, 517 F.2d 409 (CA7), cert. granted, 423 U.S. 1030, 96 S.Ct. 560, 46 L.Ed.2d 404 (1975). If the Court regarded this case only a few months ago as worthy of full briefing and argument, it ought not be effectively reversed merely by its inclusion in a laundry list of lower court decisions.\n\n\n2\n The only administrative authority relied on by the Court in support of its result is a regulation of the Civil Service Commission construing the civil service employment standards in Title 5 of the United States Code. Ante, at 250-251 n. 16. I note, however, that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304 was brought into this case by the CSC, not by respondents, and the CSC's only reason for referring to that provision was to establish that petitioners had been \"following the job-related standards of Griggs (V. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971),) for the past eighty-eight years.\" Ante, at 249 n. 15.\n\n\n3\n The provision in Title VII on which petitioners place principal reliance is 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(h). See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., supra, 401 U.S., at 433-436, 91 S.Ct., at 854-856, 28 L.Ed.2d, at 165-167.\n\n\n4\n See 5 CFR \u00a7 300.101 Et seq. (1976). These instructions contain the \"regulations\" that the Court finds supportive of the District Court's conclusion, which was reached under Title VII, but neither the instructions nor the general regulations are an interpretation of Title VII. The instructions were issued \"under authority of sections 3301 and 3302 of title 5, United States Code, and E.O. 10577, 3 CFR 1954-58 Comp., p. 218.\" 37 Fed.Reg. 21552 (1972). The pertinent regulations of the CSC in 5 CFR \u00a7 300.101 Et seq. were promulgated pursuant to the same authorities, as well as 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7151, 7154 and Exec.Order No. 11478, 3 CFR (1966-1970 Comp.) 803.\n\n\n5\n The CSC asserts that certain of its guidelines have some bearing on Test 21's job relatedness. Under the CSC instructions, \" 'criterion-related' validity,\" see Douglas v. Hampton, 168 U.S.App.D.C. 62, 70 n. 60, 512 F.2d 976, 984 n. 60 (1975), can be established by demonstrating a correlation between entrance examination scores and \"a criterion which is legitimately based on the needs of the Federal Government.\" P S3-2(a)(2), 37 Fed.Reg. 21558 (1972). Further, to prove validity, statistical studies must demonstrate that Test 21, \"to a significant degree, measures performance or qualifications requirements which are relevant to the job or jobs for which candidates are being evaluated.\" P S3-3(a), 37 Fed.Reg. 21558 (1972). These provisions are ignored in the Court's opinion.\n\n\n6\n On this basis, the CSC argues that the case ought to be remanded to enable petitioners to try to make such a demonstration, but this resolution seems to me inappropriate. Both lower courts recognized that petitioners had the burden of proof, and as this burden is yet unsatisfied, respondents are entitled to prevail.\n\n\n7\n The finding in the Futransky study on which the Court relies, Ante, at 251 n. 17, was that Test 21 \"is effective in selecting trainees who can learn the material that is taught at the Recruit School,\" because it predicts averages over 85. On its face, this would appear to be an important finding, but the fact is that Everyone learns the material included in the training course. The study noted that all recruits pass the training examinations; if a particular recruit has any difficulty, he is given assistance until he passes.\n\n\n8\n Still another factor mandates deference to the EEOC regulations. The House and Senate committees considering the 1972 amendments to Title VII recognized that discrimination in employment, including the use of testing devices, is a \"complex and pervasive phenomenon.\" S.Rep. No. 92-415, p. 5 (1971); H.R.Rep. No. 92-238, p. 8 (1971); U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1972, p. 2137. As a result, both committees noted the need to obtain \"expert assistance\" in this area. S.Rep. No. 92-415, Supra, at 5; H.R.Rep. No. 92-238, Supra, at 8.\n\n\n9\n Indeed, two Justices asserted that the Court relied too heavily on the EEOC guidelines. 422 U.S. 449, 95 S.Ct. 2389, 45 L.Ed.2d 316 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment); Id., at 451, 95 S.Ct., at 2387, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 317 (Burger, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n\n10\n Although the validity study found that Test 21 predicted job performance for white officers, but see Albemarle, 422 U.S., at 433, 95 S.Ct., at 2379, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 305, no similar relationship existed for black officers. The same finding was made as to the relationship between training examination averages and job performance. See Id., at 435, 95 S.Ct., at 2380, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 306.\n\n\n11\n The Court of Appeals recognized that deciding whether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(h) permitted such proof \"is not a simple or insignificant endeavor.\" 168 U.S.App.D.C. 42, 50 n. 59, 512 F.2d 956, 964 n. 59. The court declined to express any view on this issue on the ground that petitioners had not satisfied this standard even if it were acceptable, which seems to me the proper treatment of the question.\n\n\n12\n Griggs v.

{"text":"405 U.S. 278\n92 S.Ct. 916\n31 L.Ed.2d 202\nJohn ADAMS, Petitioner,v.State of ILLINOIS.\nNo. 70\u20145038.\nArgued Dec. 7, 1971.\nDecided March 6, 1972.\n\nSyllabus\nPetitioner's pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment against him because of the court's failure to appoint counsel to represent him at the preliminary hearing in 1967 was denied, and petitioner was tried and convicted. The Illinois Supreme Court affirmed on the ground that Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387, in which this Court held that a preliminary hearing is a critical stage of the criminal process at which the accused is constitutionally entitled to assistance of counsel, did not have retroactive application. Held: The judgment is affirmed. Pp. 280\u2014286.\n46 Ill.2d 200, 263 N.E.2d 490, affirmed.\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, joined by Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice WHITE, concluded that Coleman v. Alabama, supra does not apply retroactively to preliminary hearings conducted before June 22, 1970 when Coleman was decided. Pp. 280\u2014285.\nMr. Chief Justice BURGER concurred in the result, concluding, as set forth in his dissent in Coleman, that there is no constitutional requirement that counsel should be provided at preliminary hearings. Pp. 285\u2014286.\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN concurred in the result, concluding that Coleman was wrongly decided. P. 286.\nEdward M. Genson, Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\nE. James Gildea, Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\nMr. Justice BRENNAN announced the judgment of the Court and an opinion, in which Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice WHITE join.\n\n\n1\nIn Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387, decided June 22, 1970, we held that a preliminary hearing is a critical stage of the criminal process at which the accused is constitutionally entitled to the assistance of counsel. This case presents the question whether that constitutional doctrine applies retroactively to preliminary hearings conducted prior to June 22, 1970.\n\n\n2\nThe Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, conducted a preliminary hearing on February 10, 1967, on a charge against petitioner of selling heroin. Petitioner was not represented by counsel at the hearing. He was bound over to the grand jury, which indicted him. By pretrial motion he sought dismissal of the indictment on the ground that it was invalid because of the failure of the court to appoint counsel to represent him at the preliminary hearing. The motion was denied on May 3, 1967, on the authority of People v. Morris, 30 Ill.2d 406, 197 N.E.2d 433 (1964). In Morris the Illinois Supreme Court held that the Illinois preliminary hearing was not a critical stage at which the accused had a constitutional right to the assistance of counsel. Petitioner's conviction was affirmed by the Illinois Supreme Court, which rejected petitioner's argument that the later Coleman decision required reversal. The court acknowledged that its Morris decision was superseded by Coleman,1 but held that Coleman applied only to preliminary hearings conducted after June 22, 1970, the date Coleman was decided. 46 Ill.2d 200, 263 N.E.2d 490 (1970). We granted certiorari limited to the question of the retroactivity of Coleman. 401 U.S. 953, 91 S.Ct. 981, 28 L.Ed.2d 236 (1971). We affirm.\n\n\n3\nThe criteria guiding resolution of the question of the retroactivity of new constitutional rules of criminal procedure 'implicate (a) the purpose to be served by the new standards, (b) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards.' Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 297, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 1970, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967). We have given complete retroactive effect to the new rule, regardless of good-faith reliance by law enforcement authorities or the degree of impact on the administration of justice, where the 'major purpose of new constitutional doctrine is to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impairs its truth-finding function and so raises serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials . . ..' Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, 653, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 1152, 28 L.Ed.2d 388 (1971). Examples are the right to counsel at trial, Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963); on appeal, Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963); or at some forms of arraignment, Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114 (1961). See generally Stovall v. Denno, supra, 388 U.S., at 297\u2014298, 87 S.Ct., at 1970\u20141971; Williams v. United States, supra, 401 U.S., at 653 n. 6, 91 S.Ct., at 1152.\n\n\n4\nHowever, 'the question whether a constitutional rule of criminal procedure does or does not enhance the reliability of the fact-finding process at trial is necessarily a matter of degree,' Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 728\u2014729, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 1778, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966); it is a 'question of probabilities.' Id., at 729, 86 S.Ct., at 1778. Thus, although the rule requiring the assistance of counsel at a lineup, United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967); Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967), is 'aimed at avoiding unfairness at the trial by enhancing the reliability of the fact-finding process in the area of identification evidence,' we held that the probabilities of infecting the integrity of the truth-determining process by denial of counsel at the lineup were sufficiently less than the omission of counsel at the trial itself or on appeal that those probabilities 'must in turn be weighed against the prior justified reliance upon the old standards and the impact of retroactivity upon the administration of justice.' Stovall v. Denno, supra, 388 U.S., at 298, 87 S.Ct., at 1970.\n\n\n5\nWe hold that similarly the role of counsel at the preliminary hearing differs sufficiently from the role of counsel at trial in its impact upon the integrity of the factfinding process as to require the weighing of the probabilities of such infection against the elements of prior justified reliance and the impact of retroactivity upon the administration of criminal justice. We may lay aside the functions of counsel at the preliminary hearing that do not bear on the factfinding process at trial\u2014counsel's help in persuading the court not to hold the accused for the grand jury or meanwhile to admit the accused to bail. Coleman, 399 U.S., at 9, 90 S.Ct., at 2003. Of counsel's other functions\u2014to 'fashion a vital impeachment tool for use in cross-examination of the State's witnesses at the trial,' to 'discover the case the State has against his client,' 'making effective arguments for the accused on such matters as the necessity for an early psychiatric examination . . .,' ibid.\u2014impeachment and discovery may make particularly significant contribution to the enhancement of the factfinding process, since they materially affect an accused's ability to present an effective defense at trial. But because of limitations upon the use of the preliminary hearing for discovery and impeachment purposes, counsel cannot be as effectual as at trial or on appeal. The authority of the court to terminate the preliminary hearing once probable cause is established, see People v. Bonner, 37 Ill.2d 553, 560, 229 N.E.2d 527, 531 (1967), means that the degree of discovery obtained will vary depending on how much evidence the presiding judge receives. Too, the preliminary hearing is held at an early stage of the prosecution when the evidence ultimately gathered by the prosecution may not be complete. Cf. S.Rep.No. 371 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 33, on amending 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3060. Counsel must also avail himself of alternative procedures, always a significant factor to be weighed in the scales. Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S., at 730, 86 S.Ct., at 1779. Illinois provides, for example, bills of particulars and discovery of the names of prosecution witnesses. Ill.Rev.Stat., c. 38, \u00a7\u00a7 114\u20142, 114\u20149, 114\u201410 (1971). Pretrial statements of prosecution witnesses may also be obtained for use for impeachment purposes. See, e.g., People v. Johnson, 31 Ill.2d 602, 206 N.E.\n\n\n6\nWe accordingly agree with the conclusion of the Illinois Supreme Court, 'On this scale of probabilities, we judge that the lack of counsel at a preliminary hearing involves less danger to 'the integrity of the truth-determining process at trial' than the omission of counsel at the trial itself or on appeal. Such danger is not ordinarily greater, we consider, at a preliminary hearing at which the accused is unrepresented than at a pretrial line-up or at an interrogation conducted without presence of an attorney.' 46 Ill.2d, at 207, 263 N.E.2d, at 494.2\n\n\n7\nWe turn then to weighing the probabilities that the denial of counsel at the preliminary hearing will infect the integrity of the factfinding process at trial against the prior justified reliance upon the old standard and the impact of retroactivity upon the administration of justice. We do not think that law enforcement authorities are to be faulted for not anticipating Coleman. There was no clear foreshadowing of that rule. A contrary inference was not unreasonable in light of our decisions in Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114, and White v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed.2d 193 (1963). Hamilton denominated the arraignment stage in Alabama critical because defenses not asserted at that stage might be forever lost. White held that an uncounseled plea of guilty at a Maryland preliminary hearing could not be introduced by the State at trial. Many state courts not unreasonably regarded Hamilton and White as fashioning limited constitutional rules governing preliminary hearings. See, e.g., the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court in People v. Morris, 30 Ill.2d 406, 197 N.E.2d 433. Moreover, a number of courts, including all of the federal courts of appeals had concluded that the preliminary hearing was not a critical stage entitling an accused to the assistance of counsel.3 It is thus clear there has been understandable and widespread reliance upon this view by law enforcement officials and the courts.\n\n\n8\nIt follows that retroactive application of Coleman 'would seriously disrupt the administration of our criminal laws.' Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S., at 731, 86 S.Ct., at 1780. At the very least, the processing of current criminal calendars would be disrupted while hearings were conducted to determine whether the denial of counsel at the preliminary hearing constituted harmless error. Cf. Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S., at 300, 87 S.Ct., at 1971. The task of conducting such hearings would be immeasurably complicated by the need to construct a record of what occurred. In Illinois, for example, no court reporter was present at pre-Coleman preliminary hearings and the proceedings are therefore not recorded. See People v. Givans,83 Ill.App.2d 423, 228 N.E.2d 123 (1967). In addition, relief from this constitutional error would require not merely a new trial but also, at least in Illinois, a new preliminary hearing and a new indictment. The impact upon the administration of the criminal law of that requirement needs no elaboration. Therefore, here also, '(t)he unusual force of the countervailing considerations strengthens our conclusion in favor of prospective application.' Stovall v. Denno, supra, 388 U.S., at 299, 87 S.Ct., at 1971.\n\n\n9\nWe do not regard petitioner's case as calling for a contrary conclusion merely because he made a pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment, or because his conviction is before us on direct review. '(T)he factors of reliance and burden on the administration of justice (are) entitled to such overriding significance as to make (those) distinction(s) unsupportable.' Stovall v. Denno, supra, at 300\u2014301, 87 S.Ct., at 1972. Petitioner makes no claim of actual prejudice constituting a denial of due process. Such a claim would entitle him to a hearing without regard to today's holding that Coleman is not to be retroactively applied. See People v. Bernatowicz, 35 Ill.2d 192, 198, 220 N.E.2d 745, 748 (1966); People v. Bonner, 37 Ill.2d 553, 561, 229 N.E.2d 527, 532 (1967).\n\n\n10\nAffirmed.\n\n\n11\nMr. Justice POWELL and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n12\nMr. Chief Justice BURGER, concurring in the result.\n\n\n13\nI concur in the result but maintain the view expressed in my dissent in Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 21, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 2010, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970), that while counsel should be provided at preliminary hearings as a matter of sound judicial administration, there is no constitutional requirement that it be done. As I noted in Coleman, the constitutional command applies to 'criminal prosecutions,' not to the shifting notion of 'critical stages.' Nor can I join the view that it is a function of constitutional adjudication to assure that defense counsel can 'fashion a vital impeachment tool for the use in cross-examination of the State's witnesses at the trial' or 'discover the case the State has against his client.' 399 U.S., at 9, 90 S.Ct., at 2003. Nothing could better illustrate the extra-constitutional scope of Coleman than the interpretation of it now to explain why we do not make it 'retroactive.'\n\n\n14\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN, concurring in the result.\n\n\n15\nInasmuch as I feel that Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970), was wrongly decided, I concur in the result.\n\n\n16\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL concurs, dissenting.\n\n\n17\nUntil Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965), the Court traditionally applied new constitutional criminal procedure standards to cases finalized and police practices operative before the promulgation of the new rules.1 Linkletter, however, was the cradle of a new doctrine of nonretroactivity which exempts from relief the earlier victims of unconstitutional police practices. I have disagreed on numerous occasions with applications of various brands of this doctrine and I continue my dissent in this case.2 My own view is that even-handed justice requires either prospectivity only3 or complete retroactivity. To me there is something inherently invidious as Mr. Justice Harlan phrased it, in '(s)imply fishing one case from the stream of appellate review, using it as a vehicle for pronouncing new constitutional standards, and then permitting a stream of similar cases subsequently to flow by unaffected by that new rule . . .' Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S. 667, 679, 91 S.Ct. 1160, 1173, 28 L.Ed.2d 404 (1971) (separate opinion). I agree with his critique, id., at 695, 91 S.Ct., at 1181, that the purported distinction between those rules that are designed to improve the fact-finding process and those designed to further other values was 'inherently intractable' and to illustrate his point he adverted to the Court's difficulty in reconciling with its rule such nonretroactivity cases as Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966); Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967), and DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U.S. 631, 88 S.Ct. 2093, 20 L.Ed.2d 1308 (1968), all of which held nonretroactive decisions designed, in part, to enhance the integrity of the factfinding process. He also questioned the workability of any rule which requires a guess as to 'whether a particular decision has really announced a 'new' rule at all or whether it has simply applied a well-established constitutional principle.' Mackey v. United States, supra, 401 U.S., at 695, 91 S.Ct., at 1181; Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 263, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 1041, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969). For example, as I suggest infra, at 293\u2014295, a serious question arises in this case whether Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970), should have been fully anticipated by state judicial authorities.4\n\n\n18\nAdditionally, it is curious that the plurality rule is sensitive to 'reasonable reliance' on prior standards by law enforcement agencies but is unconcerned about the unfairness of arbitrarily granting relief to Coleman but denying it to Adams.\n\n\n19\nGiven my disagreement with the plurality's rule, I am reluctant even to attempt to apply it, but even by its own terms, the balancing approach would appear to require that we hold Coleman retroactive. This conclusion reinforces my fear that the process is too imprecise as a neutral guide for either this Court or the lower courts and will invariably permit retroactivity decisions to turn on predilections, not principles.\n\n\n20\n* In applying the rule, I am first troubled by the plurality's adoption of the finding of the court below that: 'On (the) scale of probabilities, we judge that the lack of counsel at a preliminary hearing involves less danger to 'the integrity of the truth-determining process at trial' than the omission of counsel at the trial itself or on appeal.' Ante, at 282\u2014283. The same might have been said of the right to counsel at sentencing, Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128, 88 S.Ct. 254, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967), at certain arraignments, Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114 (1961), or at preliminary hearings where guilty pleas were taken, White v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed.2d 193 (1963), all of which have been held retroactive.5\n\n\n21\nRather than reaching for these analogies, however the plurality suggests that the danger to the integrity of the truth-determining process is no greater here than at a pretrial lineup or at an interrogation conducted without counsel. In relying on these analogies, the plurality gives short shrift to the argument that 'in practice (the preliminary) hearing may provide the defense with the most valuable discovery technique available to him,' U.S. ex rel. Wheeler v. Flood, 269 F.Supp. 194, 198 (EDNY 1967), an objective which is not so readily achievable at lineups and interrogations at which counsel serves only a protective function. The State's access to superior investigative resources and its ability to keep its case secret until trial normally puts the defendant at a clear disadvantage.6 In light of this disparity, one important service the preliminary hearing performs is to permit counsel to penetrate the evidence offered by the prosecution at the hearing, to test its strengths and weaknesses (without the presence of a jury), to learn the names and addresses of witnesses, to focus upon the key factual issues in the upcoming trial, and to preserve testimony for impeachment purposes. The alternative discovery techniques suggested now by the plurality are puny in comparison. A bill of particulars can usually reach only prosecution witnesses' names, and it may be cold comfort to defense counsel to learn that he can obtain pretrial statements of prosecution witnesses inasmuch as such statements are often prepared from the State's viewpoint and have not been subjected to cross-examination. And in many States such statements are not discoverable.\n\n\n22\nFinally, when read in light of Coleman's exaltation of the virtues of counseled preliminary hearings, the present language of the plurality may lend itself to a 'credibility gap' between it and those involved in the administration of the criminal process. 'Plainly,' said the Coleman Court, 'the guiding hand of counsel at the preliminary hearing is essential to protect the indigent accused against an erroneous or improper prosecution,' Coleman v. Alabama, supra, 399 U.S., at 9, 90 S.Ct., at 2003, and: 'The inability of the indigent accused on his own to realize these advantages of a lawyer's assistance compels the conclusion that the Alabama preliminary hearing is a 'critical stage' of the State's criminal process at which the accused is 'as much entitled to such aid (of counsel) . . . as at the trial itself.\" Id., at 9 10, 90 S.Ct., at 2003. It will now appear somewhat anomalous that the right to counsel at a preliminary hearing is fundamental enough to be incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment but not fundamental enough to warrant application to the victims of previous unconstitutional conduct.7\n\nII\n\n23\nI also believe that the plurality's case for establishing good-faith reliance on 'the old standards' by state judicial systems ignores important developments in the right-to-counsel cases prior to Coleman. First of all, no decision of this Court had held that counsel need not be afforded at the preliminary hearing stage. Therefore, to build a case for good-faith reliance the State must wring from our decision the negative implication that uncounseled probable-cause hearings were permissible. Such negative implications are found, says the plurality, in Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114 (1961), and White v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed.2d 193 (1963), cases reversing convictions obtained through the use at trial of uncounseled guilty pleas entered at preliminary hearings. Neither of those decisions, however, faced the question of whether reversal was required on the facts of the instant case. And, though I have studied these two short opinions, I am unable, as is the plurality, to divine any hidden message to law enforcement agencies that we would permit the denial of counsel at preliminary hearings where guilty pleas were not taken. Rather, these cases reinforce, in my mind, the importance of counsel at every stage in the criminal process. In any event, by the time Coleman came down, it was clear, as Mr. Justice Harlan opined, albeit with some regret, that our holding was an inevitable consequence of prior case law:\n\n\n24\n'If I felt free to consider this case upon a clean slate I      would have voted to affirm these convictions. But\u2014in light of      the lengths to which the right to appointed counsel has been      carried in recent decisions of this Court see Miranda v.      Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966);      United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18      L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967); Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 87      S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967); Mathis v. United States,      391 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1503, 20 L.Ed.2d 381 (1968); and Orozco      v. Texas, 394 U.S. 324, 89 S.Ct. 1095, 22 L.Ed.2d 311 (1969)      I consider that course is not open to me with due regard for      the way in which the adjudicatory process of this Court, as I      conceive it, should work. . . .\n\n\n25\nIt would indeed be strange were this Court, having held a      suspect or an accused entitled to counsel at such pre-trial      stages as 'in-custody' police investigation, whether at the      station house (Miranda) or even in the home (Orozco), now to      hold that he is left to fend for himself at the first formal      confrontation in the courtroom.' Coleman v. Alabama, supra,      399 U.S., at 19\u201420, 90 S.Ct., at 2008 (separate opinion).8\n\n\n26\nThus, in the instant case, at the times relevant, the State should have foreseen that the right to counsel attached to the probable-cause hearing.\n\nIII\n\n27\nI also disagree that '(t)he impact upon the administration of the criminal law of (Coleman retroactivity) needs no elaboration.' Ante, at 284. In the 19 months since Coleman was decided all new prosecutions have presumably followed it and we therefore need only be concerned for impact purposes, with those state proceedings in which a preliminary hearing was held prior to June 1970. Inasmuch as the median state sentence served by felons when they are first released is about 20.9 months,9 most pre-Coleman sentences would now be served and as a practical matter these former prisoners would not seek judicial review. Moreover, we may exclude from our consideration those 16 or more States that prior to Coleman routinely appointed counsel at or prior to preliminary hearings. See American Bar Association, Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Providing Defense Services \u00a7 5.1 (Approved Draft 1968). Additionally, we may exclude from consideration the possibility of collateral challenges by federal prisoners inasmuch as counsel have routinely been present at preliminary hearings before federal commissioners.10 See Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 5(b).\n\n\n28\nWhile there are some current prisoners who might challenge their confinements if Coleman were held retrospective, many of these attacks would probably fail under the harmless-error rule of Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). The plurality opinion suggests that conducting such harmless-error proceedings would be onerous. One reason given is that in Illinois, for example, preliminary hearings were not recorded before Coleman. That assertion may not be entirely accurate in light of the fact that this very record contains a transcript of Adams' preliminary hearing. Perhaps, as the respondent seems to concede,11 transcripts were made available in other Illinois cases. That is the more reasonable assumption in light of our holding in Roberts v. LaVallee, 389 U.S. 40, 88 S.Ct. 194, 19 L.Ed.2d 41 (1967), that the State must provide a preliminary hearing transcript to an indigent in every circumstances in which the more affluent accused could obtain one.\n\n\n29\nEven where a transcript was not available, however, a prisoner might be able to show at an evidentiary hearing that he was prejudiced by a particular need for discovery, by the inability to preserve the testimony of either an adverse or favorable witness, or by the inability to secure his release on bail in order to assist in the preparation of his defense.12 Courts are accustomed, of course, to assessing claims of prejudice without the aid of transcripts of previous proceedings, such as is required by Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964), or Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 70 (1963). Indeed, in Coleman we remanded for a determination of whether the failure to appoint counsel had been harmless error, 399 U.S., at 11, 90 S.Ct., at 2004. Not every Coleman claim would warrant an evidentiary hearing. Many attacks might be disposed of summarily, such as a challenge to a conviction resulting from a counseled guilty plea entered before any prejudice had materialized from an uncounseled preliminary hearing. See Procunier v. Atchley, 400 U.S. 446, 91 S.Ct. 485, 27 L.Ed.2d 524 (1971).\n\n\n30\nEven Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S., at 299, 87 S.Ct., at 1971, the analogy frequently invoked by the plurality, held out the possibility of collateral relief in cases where prisoners could show that their lineups had imposed 'such unfairness that (they) infringed (their) right to due process of law.' Conducting Coleman harmless-error hearings would not appear to be any more burdensome on the administration of criminal justice than have Stovall 'fundamental fairness' post-conviction proceedings.\n\n\n31\nIn any event, whatever litigation might follow a holding of Coleman retrospectivity must be considered part of the price we pay for former failures to provide fair procedures.\n\n\n\n1\n The Illinois Supreme Court stated, 46 Ill.2d, at 205\u2014206, 263 N.E.2d, at 493,\n'A preliminary hearing in Alabama, as in Illinois, has the purpose of determining whether there is probable cause to believe an offense has been committed by the defendant . . .. In both States the hearing is not a required step in the process of prosecution, as the prosecutor may seek an indictment directly from the grand jury, thereby eliminating the proceeding. . . . In neither State is a defendant required to offer defenses at the hearing at the risk of being precluded from raising them at the trial itself. . . . We conclude that the preliminary hearing procedures of Alabama and Illinois are substantially alike and we must consider because of Coleman v. Alabama . . . that a preliminary hearing conducted pursuant to section 109\u20143 of the Criminal Code (Ill.Rev.Stat. 1969, ch. 38, par. 109\u20143) is a 'critical stage' in this State's criminal process so as to entitle the accused to the assistance of counsel.'\nA right to a preliminary hearing has been constitutionally established, effective July 1, 1971. Illinois Constitution of 1970, Art. I, \u00a7 7, S.H.A.\n\n\n2\n Accord: Phillips v. North Carolina, 433 F.2d 659, 662 (1970), where the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit observed:\n'To be sure, if a preliminary hearing is held, the accused gains important rights and advantages that can be effectively exercised only through his attorney. Counsel's function, however, differs from his function at trial. Broadly speaking, his role at the preliminary hearing is to advise, observe, discover the facts, and probe the state's case. In this respect he serves in somewhat the same capacity as counsel at lineups and interrogations, which are both pretrial stages of criminal proceedings where the right to counsel has not been held retroactive.'\n\n\n3\n Pagan Cancel v.

Denno, supra, 388 U.S., at 301, 87 S.Ct., at 1972, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199, that a prospective-only holding would violate the Art. III requirement of case or controversy. But see England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, 375 U.S. 411, 422, 84 S.Ct. 461, 468, 11 L.Ed.2d 440 (1964) where the Court exempted the petitioner from its holding. See also Johnson v. New Jersey, supra, 384 U.S., at 733, 86 S.Ct., at 1780, 16 L.Ed.2d 882.\n\n\n4\n While I subscribe to many of the reservations expressed by Mr. Justice Harlan, I nonetheless find his alternative rule of retrospectivity unsatisfactory. In Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S. 667, 675, 91 S.Ct. 1171, 28 L.Ed.2d 404 (1971) (separate opinion), he suggested that constitutional decisions be retroactive as to all nonfinal convictions pending at the time of the particular holdings, but that prisoners seeking habeas relief should generally be treated according to the law prevailing at the time of their convictions. It is on this latter score that I am troubled. Surely it would be no more facile a task to unearth the\nstate of law of years past than it is to assign, under the plurality's test, a degree of reasonableness to reliance on older standards by law enforcement agencies. Where the question has arisen in this Court, we have treated habeas petitioners by the modern law, not by older rules. See Reck v. Pate, 367 U.S. 433, 81 S.Ct. 1541, 6 L.Ed.2d 948 (1961) (habeas permitted on basis of current law to release prisoner convicted in 1936). See also Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), and Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964), announcing new rules in habeas cases. Moreover, as has been concluded by Professor Schwartz, the drawing of a bright line between federal review through habeas and certiorari would be unjustified:\n'Where federal review of the constitutionality of state criminal proceedings is concerned, the making of so sharp a distinction between review on certiorari and habeas corpus is unwarranted. There is often no significant difference with respect to age and potential staleness between the two types of cases. Rather than coming years after the conviction is final, habeas corpus is often but a routine step in the criminal defense process the normal step taken after certiorari has been denied. Sometimes, it actually replaces certiorari, for in Fay v. Noia (372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963)) the Supreme Court advised criminal defendants to skip certiorari and to petition directly to the federal district court for habeas corpus. Even in situations in which a defendant goes through all the direct review steps, it is often nothing more than fortuitous circumstance which determines whether his case is still on direct review or is on collateral attack when the new decision comes down.\n'The difference between review on certiorari and habeas corpus seems even less significant when we look to function and actual operation. Although it is sometimes considered the 'normal' method for obtaining federal review of state convictions, certiorari does not provide, as the Court remarked in Fay v. Noia, 'a normal appellate channel in any sense comparable to the writ of error,' for the Court must limit its jurisdiction to questions that have significance beyond the immediate case. Habeas corpus, on the other hand, facilitates the Court's task in those cases it does take by providing a record focused exclusively on the federal constitutional question. Habeas corpus has thus become the primary vehicle for immediate federal\nreview of state convictions. Further, this development has resulted in a gradual shrinking of what were once significant operational differences between review on certiorari and habeas corpus, such as the relationship to the state proceeding, the degree of independent fact-finding authority, and the significance of the defendant's violation of state procedural rules. From both the functional and the operational standpoints, then, it is justifiable to conclude that 'the distinctions between habeas corpus proceedings and direct review are largely illusory.'\n'In addition, drawing a line between review (on) certiorari and habeas corpus undercuts the Supreme Court's bypass suggestion in Fay v. Noia. If a defendant has doubts about the retroactivity of any claim which might both affect him and be subject to Court review in the foreseeable future, he will be well advised always to ignore the Court's suggestion and to apply for certiorari. Many months may pass before his petition for certiorari is rejected, and so long as it is pending, he will be entitled to receive the benefits of any intervening decisions. As soon as he files his petition for habeas corpus, however, even if he does so only a day after the last state court order is entered, he will have forfeited his right to such benefits. He will thus be put to an election between delayed relief and no relief at all.\n'The inequity of drawing a sharp distinction between direct review and habeas corpus is, however, only one aspect of a broader inequity: treating two prisoners deprived of the same fundamental constitutional right differently merely because the Supreme Court did not get around to enunciating a particular right until after the conviction of one of them had become final. Professor Mishkin argues that worry about this point ignores 'the reasons for barring current convictions and . . . the fact that the new rule in no way undermines the earlier determinations of factual guilt.' To him, it is as if a guilty person were to complain of his lot because others equally guilty were not prosecuted. And though he recognizes that such claims are sometimes sustained. he concludes that 'there are certainly rational bases for drawing a line between current convictions and\nthose previously final,' citing excerpts from Professors Bator and Amsterdam on finality. Professor Mishkin's sharp distinction between collateral attack and direct review thus rests ultimately on finality considerations.\n'Finality considerations seem especially weak where two cases differ only in the fact that one is still on 'direct' review whereas the other is not. Where the two cases are far apart in age, finality considerations are admittedly more persuasive. But even there, the mere timing of the Court's decision to grant federal protection to a fundamental right hardly seems to be a sufficient basis for unequal treatment; after all, in most instances it was not the older prisoner's fault that the Court did not render its decision earlier. To some extent, of course, the question comes down to a choice between the competing values of equality and repose, and choices of this sort are notoriously immune to reasoned resolution. It will be suggested below, however, that the threat to finality considerations from complete retroactivity appears to have been greatly exaggerated, and if this suggestion is well taken, Professor Mishkin's rejection of equality is especially untenable.'

It also results from the fact that the police are usually first at the scene of the crime, have access to witnesses with fresher recollections, are authorized to confiscate removable evidence, are positioned to conduct laboratory tests on physical evidence, enjoy a communication channel with a complete undercover world of secret informers, have an air of legitimacy which is conducive to cooperation by witnesses, and have numerous ways to compel testimony even before trial.

But here, as the plurality suggests, three of the four functions counsel might serve at preliminary hearings would appear to enhance the factfinding process: discovery of the State's case, preserving of testimony of both hostile and favorable witnesses, and obtaining release on bail. Although the plurality appears to discount the investigative advantage of being free on bail, I believe that this 'traditional right to freedom before conviction permits the unhampered preparation of a defense.'

Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596, followed. Pp. 892-898.\nAffirmed.\nMark L. Evans, Washington, D.C., for the United States.\nCharles M. Sevilla, San Diego, Cal., for Luis Antonio Ortiz.\nMr. Justice POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nBorder Patrol officers stopped respondent's car for a routine immigration search at the traffic checkpoint on Interstate Highway 5 at San Clemente, Cal., on November 12, 1973. They found three aliens concealed in the trunk, and respondent was convicted on three counts of knowingly transporting aliens who were in the country illegally. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the conviction in an unreported opinion, relying on dictum in its opinion in United States v. Bowen, 500 F.2d 960 (CA9 1974), aff'd, 422 U.S. 916, 95 S.Ct. 2569, 45 L.Ed.2d 641, to the effect that our decision in Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973), required probable cause for all vehicle searches in the border area, whether conducted by roving patrols or at traffic checkpoints. We granted certiorari. 419 U.S. 824, 95 S.Ct. 40, 42 L.Ed.2d 47 (1974).\n\n\n2\nNothing in this record suggests that the Border Patrol officers had any special reason to suspect that respondent's car was carrying concealed aliens. Nor does the Government contend that the San Clemente checkpoint is a functional equivalent of the border. Brief for United States 16. The only question for decision is whether vehicle searches at traffic checkpoints, like the roving-patrol search in Almeida-Sanchez, must be based on probable cause.\n\n\n3\n* In Almeida-Sanchez we rejected the Government's contention that the Nation's strong interest in controlling immigration and the practical difficulties of policing the Mexican border combined to justify dispensing with both warrant and probable cause for vehicle searches by roving patrols near the border. The facts did not require us to decide whether the same rule would apply to traffic checkpoints, which differ from roving patrols in several important respects. 413 U.S., at 273, 93 S.Ct., at 2539; id., at 276, 93 S.Ct., at 2541 (Powell, J., concurring).\n\n\n4\nA consolidated proceeding on motions to suppress in this and similar cases produced an extensive factual record on the operation of traffic checkpoints in southern California. United States v. Baca, 368 F.Supp. 398 (SDCal.1973). The San Clemente checkpoint is 62 air miles and 66 road miles north of the Mexican border. It is on the principal highway between San Diego and Los Angeles, and over 10 million vehicles pass the checkpoint in a year. United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 514 F.2d 308, 312 (CA9 1975). The District Court in Baca described the checkpoint as follows:\n\n\n5\n'Approximately one mile south of the checkpoint is a large      black on yellow sign with flashing yellow lights over the      highway stating 'ALL VEHICLES, STOP AHEAD, 1 MILE.'      Three-quarters of a mile further north are two black on      yellow signs suspended over the highway with flashing lights      stating 'WATCH FOR BRAKE LIGHTS.' At the checkpoint, which is      also the location of a State of California weighing station,      are two large signs with flashing red lights suspended over      the highway. These signs each state 'STOP HERE\u2014U.S.      OFFICERS.' Placed on the highway are a number of orange      traffic cones funneling traffic into two lanes where a Border      Patrol agent in full dress uniform, standing behind a white      on red 'STOP' sign checks traffic. Blocking traffic in the      unused lanes are official U.S. Border Patrol vehicles with      flashing red lights. In addition, there is a permanent      building which houses the Border Patrol office and temporary      detention facilities. There are also floodlights for      nighttime operation.' 368 F.Supp., at 410\u2014411.\n\n\n6\nThe Border Patrol would prefer to keep this checkpoint in operation continuously, but bad weather, heavey traffic, and personnel shortages keep it closed about one-third of the time. When it is open, officers screen all northbound traffic. If anything about a vehicle or its occupants leads an officer to suspect that it may be carrying aliens, he will stop the car and ask the occupants about their citizenship. If the officer's suspicion persists, or if the questioning enhances it, he will 'inspect' portions of the car in which an alien might hide.1 Operations at other checkpoints are similar, although the traffic at some is light enough that officers can stop all vehicles for questioning and routinely inspect more of them.\n\n\n7\nThe Government maintains that these characteristics justify dispensing with probable cause at traffic checkpoints despite the Court's holding in Almeida-Sanchez. It gives essentially two reasons for distinguishing that case. First, a checkpoint officer's discretion in deciding which cars to search is limited by the location of the checkpoint. That location is determined by high-level Border Patrol officals, using criteria that include the degree of inconvenience to the public and the potential for safe operation, as well as the potential for detecting and deterring the illegal movement of aliens. By contrast, officers on roving patrol were theoretically free before Almeida-Sanchez to stop and search any car within 100 miles of the border. Second, the circumstances surrounding a checkpoint stop and search are far less intrusive than those attending a roving-patrol stop. Roving patrols often operate at night on seldom-traveled roads, and their approach may frighten motorists. At traffic checkpoints the motorist can see that other vehicles are being stopped, he can see visible signs of the officers' authority, and he is much less likely to be frightened or annoyed by the intrusion.\n\n\n8\nThese differences are relevant to the constitutional issue, since the central concern of the Fourth Amendment is to protect liberty and privacy from arbitrary and oppressive interference by government officials. Camara v. Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco, 387 U.S. 523, 528, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 1730, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967); Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 767, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 1833\u20141834, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966). The Fourth Amendment's requirement that searches and seizures be reasonable also may limit police use of unnecessarily frightening or offensive methods of surveillance and investigation. See e.g., Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 16\u201417, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1877\u20141878, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); Camara, supra, 387 U.S. at 531, 87 S.Ct. at 1732; Schmerber, supra, 384 U.S. at 771\u2014772, 86 S.Ct. at 1836. While the differences between a roving patrol and a checkpoint would be significant in determining the propriety of the stop, which is considerably less intrusive than a search, Terry v. Ohio, supra, they do not appear to make any difference in the search itself. The greater regularity attending the stop does not mitigate the invasion of privacy that a search entails. Nor do checkpoint procedures significantly reduce the likelihood of embarrassment. Motorists whose cars are searched, unlike those who are only questioned, may not be reassured by seeing that the Border Patrol searches other cars as well. Where only a few are singled out for a search, as at San Clemente, motorists may find the searches especially offensive. See Note, Border Searches and the Fourth Amendment, 77 Yale L.J. 1007, 1012\u20141013 (1968).\n\n\n9\nMoreover we are not persuaded that the checkpoint limits to any meaningful extent the officer's discretion to select cars for search. The record in the consolidated proceeding indicates that only about 3% of the cars that pass the San Clemente checkpoint are stopped for either questioning or a search, 368 F.Supp., at 411. Throughout the system, fewer than 3% of the vehicles that passed through checkpoints in 1974 were searched, Brief for United States 29, and no checkpoint involved in Baca reported a search rate of more than 10% or 15%. 368 F.Supp., at 412\u2014415. It is apparent from these figures that checkpoint officers exercise a substantial degree of discretion in deciding which cars to search. The Government maintains that they voluntarily exercise that discretion with restraint and search only vehicles that arouse their suspicion, and it insists the officers should be free of judicial oversight of any kind. Viewed realistically, this position would authorize the Border Patrol to search vehicles at random, for no officer ever would have to justify his decision to search a particular car.\n\n\n10\nThis degree of discretion to search private automobiles is not consistent with the Fourth Amendment. A search, even of an automobile, is a substantial invasion of privacy.2 To protect that privacy from official arbitrariness, the Court always have regarded probable cause as the minimum requirement for a lawful search. Almeida-Sanchez, 413 U.S., at 269\u2014270, 93 S.Ct., at 2537 2538; Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42, 51, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 1981, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970). We are not persuaded that the differences between roving patrols and traffic checkpoints justify dispensing in this case with the safeguards we required in Almeida-Sanchez. We therefore follow that decision and hold that at traffic checkpoints removed from the border and its functional equivalents, officers may not search private vehicles without consent or probable cause.3\n\n\n11\nThe Government lists in its reply brief some of the factors on which officers have relied in deciding which cars to search. They include the number of persons in a vehicle, the appearance and behavior of the driver and passengers, their inability to speak English, the responses they give to officers' questions, the nature of the vehicle, and indications that it may be heavily loaded. All of these factors properly may be taken into account in deciding whether there is probable cause to search a particular vehicle. In addition, as we note today in United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S., at 884\u2014885, 95 S.Ct., at 2582, the officers are entitled to draw reasonable inferences from these facts in light of their knowledge of the area and their prior experience with aliens and smugglers. In this case, however, the officers advanced no special reasons for believing respondent's vehicle contained aliens. The absence of probable cause makes the search invalid.\n\nII\n\n12\nThe Government also contends that even if Almeida-Sanchez applies to checkpoint searches, the Court of Appeals erred in voiding this search because it occurred after the date of decision in Almeida-Sanchez but before the Court of Appeals stated in United States v. Bowen, supra, that it would require probable cause for checkpoint searches. Examination of the Government's brief in the Ninth Circuit indicates that it did not raise this question below. On the contrary, it represented to the court that the decision in Bowen would be 'determinative of the issues in this case.' We therefore decline to consider this issue, which was raised for the first time in the petition for certiorari.\n\n\n13\nAffirmed.\n\n\n14\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST, concurring.\n\n\n15\nI joined the dissent of my Brother White in Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973), and recognize that the present decision is an extension of the unsound rule announced in that case. I nonetheless join the opinion of the Court, because a majority of the Court still adheres to Almeida-Sanchez and because I agree with the Court's analysis of the significance of the Government's proffered distinctions between roving and fixed-checkpoint searches.\n\n\n16\nI wish to stress, however, that the Court's opinion is confined to full searches, and does not extend to fixed-checkpoint stops for the purpose of inquiring about citizenship. Such stops involve only a modest intrusion, are not likely to be frightening or significantly annoying, are regularized by the fixed situs, and effectively serve the important national interest in controlling illegal entry. I do not regard such stops as unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, whether or not accompanied by 'reasonable suspicion' that a particular vehicle is involved in immigration violations, cf. United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607, and I do not understand today's opinion to cast doubt upon their constitutionality.\n\n\n17\nMr. Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Mr. Justice BLACKMUN joins, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n18\nLike Mr. Justice WHITE I can, at most, do no more than concur in the judgment. As the Fourth Amendment now has been interpreted by the Court it seems that the Immigration and Naturalization Service is powerless to stop the tide of illegal aliens\u2014and dangerous drugs\u2014that daily and freely crosses our 2,000-mile southern boundary.1 Perhaps these decisions will be seen in perspective as but another example of a society seemingly impotent to deal with massive lawlessness. In that sense history may view us as prisoners of our own traditional and appropriate concern for individual rights, unable\u2014or unwilling\u2014to apply the concept of reasonableness explicit in the Fourth Amendment in order to develop a rational accommodation between those rights and the literal safety of the country.\n\n\n19\nGiven today's decisions it would appear that, absent legislative action, nothing less than a massive force of guards could adequately protect our southern border.2 To establish hundreds of checkpoints with enlarged border forces so as to stop literally every car and pedestrian at every border checkpoint, however, would doubtless impede the flow of commerce and travel between this country and Mexico. Moreover, it is uncertain whether stringent penalties for employment of illegal aliens, and rigid requirements for proof of legal entry before employment, would help solve the problems, but those remedies have not been tried.\n\n\n20\nI would hope that when we next deal with this problem we give greater weight to the reality that the Fourth Amendment prohibits only 'unreasonable searches and seizures' and to the frequent admonition that reasonableness must take into account all the circumstances and balance the rights of the individual with the needs of society. See, e.g., Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 206, 80 S.Ct. 1437, 4 L.Ed.2d 1669 (1960); United States v. Biswell, 406 U.S. 311, 92 S.Ct. 1593, 32 L.Ed.2d 87 (1972).\n\n\n21\nAPPENDIX TO OPINION OF BURGER, C.J., CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT\n\n\n22\nExcerpt from Judge Turrentine's opinion in United States v. Baca, 368 F.Supp. 398, 402\u2014408 (SDCal.1973)\n\nTHE ILLEGAL ALIEN PROBLEM\n\n23\nThe United States through legislative action has determined that it is in the best interest of the nation to limit the number of persons who can legally immigrate into the country in any given year. These controls reflect in part a Congressional intent to protect the American labor market from an influx of foreign labor. Karnuth v. United States, 279 U.S. 231, 49 S.Ct. 274, 73 L.Ed. 677 (1929); \u00a7 201(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, as amended by the Act of October 3, 1965, 79 Stat. 911, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151(a).\n\n\n24\nUnder this policy of limited admission, 385,685 new immigrants entered the United States legally during fiscal year 1972. Since July 1, 1968, the law has established an annual quota of 120,000 persons for the independent countries of the Western Hemisphere. Included within this quota are immigrants from the Republic of Mexico who in fiscal year 1972 totalled 64,040. 1972 Annual Report, Immigration and Naturalization Service, pp. 2, 28.\n\n\n25\nCurrently illegal aliens are in residence within the United States in numbers which, while not susceptible of exact measurement, are estimated to be in the vicinity of 800,000 to over one million. Department of Justice, Special Study Group on Illegal Immigrants from Mexico, A Program for Effective And Humane Action on Illegal Mexican Immigrants, 6 (1973) (hereinafter cited as Cramton Rpt.).\n\n\n26\nOf these illegal aliens, approximately 85 percent are citizens of Mexico. Cramton Rpt. at 6. They are industrious, proud and hard-working people who enter this country for the purpose of earning wages, accumulating savings, and returning or sending their savings home to Mexico.\n\n\n27\nSince 1970, the number of illegal Mexican aliens in the United States who have been apprehended has been growing at a rate in excess of 20 percent per year. Cramton Rpt. at 6.\n\n\n28\nThe increasingly large numbers of Mexican nationals seeking to illegally enter this country reflects the substantial unemployment and underemployment in Mexico\u2014fueled by one of the highest birth rates in the world. Moreover, Mexican employment statistics are not likely to improve dramatically since fully 45 percent of Mexico's population is under 15 years of age and, therefore, will soon be attempting to enter the labor market.\n\n\n29\nFurther prompting Mexican nationals to seek employment in the United States is the fact that there is a significant disparity in wage rates between this country and Mexico. In Mexicali and Tijuana, both Mexican cities bordering the Southern District and each with a population in excess of 400,000, the average daily wage is about $3.40 per day. The minimum wage is even lower for workers in the interior of Mexico. The average worker in Mexico, assuming he can find work, earns in a day as much as he can make in only a few hours in the United States.\n\n\n30\nIn addition, it is estimated that the per capita income of the poorest 40 percent of the Mexican population, the strata most likely to leave their homeland in search of employment in the United States, is less than $150 per year.\n\n\n31\nThe manpower needs of the United States generated by World War II resulted in many Mexicans being imported into this country and becoming familiar with employment opportunities and practices in the United States. See Diaz v. Kay-Dix Ranch, 9 Cal.App.3d 588, 88 Cal.Rptr. 443 (1970).\n\n\n32\nThe opportunities available to Mexican aliens have traditionally been in agriculture. While still true in many parts of the United States Southwest, in recent years the pattern has changed and more and more illegal aliens are obtaining employment in the service and manufacturing sectors of our economy. These aliens are increasingly found in virtually all regions of the country and in all segments of the economy. State Social Welfare Board, Issue: Aliens in California, 12 (1973) (Hereinafter cited as Aliens in California).\n\n\n33\nThe nature of the change in employment opportunities available is demonstrated by one estimate that 250,000 illegal aliens are employed in Los Angeles County where agricultural opportunities are known to be limited. Hearings on Illegal Aliens Before Subcomm. No. 1 of the House Comm. on the Judiciary, 92d Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, at 208 (1971) (Hereinafter cited as Hearings on Illegal Aliens).\n\n\n34\nOther estimates of the impact of illegal aliens in California suggest that in 1971, when 595,000 Californians were unemployed (7.4 percent of the State's labor force), there were between 200,000 and 300,000 illegal aliens employed in California earning approximately $100 million in wages. Hearings on Illegal Aliens at 150.\n\n\n35\nSince the majority of Mexicans are unskilled or low skilled workers they tend to compete with Mexican-Americans, blacks, Indians, and other minority groups who, due to the declining percentage of jobs requiring low or no skills, are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain gainful employment. Cramton Rpt. at 12.\n\n\n36\nIllegal aliens compete for jobs with persons legally residing in the United States who are unskilled and uneducated and who form that very group which our society is trying to provide with a fair share of America's prosperity.\n\n\n37\nIn addition, illegal aliens tend to perpetuate poor economic conditions by frustrating unionization, especially in such occupations as farm work.\n\n\n38\nIllegal aliens pose a potential health hazard to the community since many seek work as nursemaids, food handlers, cooks, housekeepers, waiters, dishwashers, and grocery workers. Immigration and medical officials in Los Angeles, for example, have discovered that the illegal alien population in Los Angeles' barrio is infected with a high incidence of typhoid, dysentery, tuberculosis, tapeworms, veneral disease and hepatitis. L. A. Times, Sept. 16, 1973, pt II, at 1.\n\n\n39\nIn some states illegal aliens abuse public assistance programs. In some instances entire families who entered the country illegally have been admitted to the welfare rolls. Aliens in California at 35, 43.\n\n\n40\nAnother aspect of the problem created by illegal aliens is that employed aliens tend to send a substantial portion of their earnings to relatives or friends in Mexico. This outflow of United States dollars exacerbates our balance of payments problem to the extent of $1 billion a year. Hearings on Illegal Aliens, pt. 3 at 683.\n\n\n41\nThe net effect of this silent invasion of illegal aliens from Mexico is suffering by the aliens who are frequently victims of extortion, violence and sharp practices, displacement of American citizens and legally residing aliens from the labor market, and irritation between two neighboring countries.\n\nTHE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROBLEM\n\n42\nGiven that illegal aliens are a significant problem in American life, especially for those minority groups who are described as economically deprived, and that Congress has decreed that all but a relatively few aliens are to be permanently excluded, then we must analyze what law enforcement problems exist. In this regard, the following findings of fact are made:\n\n\n43\nThe illegal alien problem is one found primarily in the Southwestern Region of the United States.\n\n\n44\nThis problem along the Mexican-American border has existed for some time with the original responsibility for securing the integrity of the border being assigned to the U.S. Army, along with the Departments of Treasury and Labor, who had about 20,000 men assigned to the border between Brownsville, Texas, and San Diego, California, in 1920. National Geographic Magazine, 'Along Our Side of the Mexican Border.' (July 1920).\n\n\n45\nCurrently the burden of controlling the entry of aliens and stemming the flow of illegal aliens along the Mexican-American border is assigned to the INS.1\n\n\n46\nThe border extends for almost 2,000 miles from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Coast.\n\n\n47\nAlong this border there were over 152 million legal entries at authorized ports of entry during fiscal 1972, of which over 91 million were made by aliens. Over 39 million of the legal entries were made at the three ports of entry in Southern California (Calexico, San Ysidro and Tecate) of which over 24 million were made by aliens. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 1972 Annual Report, 25.\n\n\n48\nOf these entries made by aliens, the large portion were made by visitors with official permission to enter the country who had been issued temporary 'border passes' such as I\u2014186 cards (issued to residents of Mexico), which authorize the holder to travel within an area no further than 25 miles from the border and for a period of time not to exceed 72 hours. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.6.\n\n\n49\nThese temporary border passes (I\u2014186) are issued to simplify procedures needed for entry, and the issuing process recognizes the inter-relationship of contiguous communities along both sides of the border. Hearings on Illegal Aliens, pt. 1, 192.\n\n\n50\nIn fiscal 1973 approximately 208,000 I\u2014186 cards were issued and it is estimated that over two million such cards are currently in circulation. Hearings on Illegal Aliens, pt. 1, 173.\n\n\n51\nWithin the INS, the U.S. Border Patrol, which was first established in 1924, has the primary function of preventing the illegal entry of aliens and the apprehension of those who have entered illegally and those who smuggle these illegal entrants.\n\n\n52\nThe Border Patrol has approximately 1,700 agents, who are well-trained law enforcement officers, and of these about 80 percent are assigned along our southern border with Mexico.\n\n\n53\nA 'deportable alien' is a person who has been found to be deportable by an immigration judge, or who admits his deportability upon questioning by official agents.\n\n\n54\nThe number of deportable aliens apprehended by the Border Patrol (which makes the great majority of apprehensions) nationally has grown from 38,861 during fiscal 1963 to 498,123 in fiscal 1973; of this number 128,889 were found by Border Patrol agents working in the Chula Vista sector which includes 70 miles of the border in San Diego County, and 23,125 were located by agents in the El Centro sector which includes the Imperial County of California and 75 miles of the Mexican-American border.\n\n\n55\nThe Border Patrol agents have the power to apprehend illegal aliens since by regulation the Attorney General has designated Border Patrol agents to be immigration officers and authorized them to exercise powers and duties as such officers (8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.1(i)); immigration officers by statute \u00a7 101(a)(17) of the Immigartion and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163; as amended by the Act of October 3, 1973, 79 Stat. 911, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(17), are empowered, without a warrant, to stop and interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his right to remain or to be in the United States. See Au Yi Lau v. I.N.S., 144 U.S.App.D.C. 147, 445 F.2d 217 (1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 864, 92 S.Ct. 64, 30 L.Ed.2d 108.\n\n\n56\nSec. 287(a)(3) of the 1952 Immigration Act provides authority for an immigration officer within a reasonable distance from the border of the United States to board and search any conveyance or vehicle; 'reasonable distance' as used in that section of the Act means within 100 air miles from any external boundary of the United States, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.1(b).\n\n\n57\nImmigration officers also are authorized to conduct inspection of aliens seeking admission or readmission to, or the privilege of passing through, the United States, and also are authorized and empowered to board and search any vehicle or like conveyance in which they believe aliens are being brought into the United States. Sec. 235(a) of the 1952 Immigration Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225(a).\n\n\n58\nThe deployment of Border Patrol agents along the border is intended to maximize the effectiveness of the limited number of personnel, with the first line of defense being called the 'line watch.' The line watch consists of agents being placed immediately upon the physical boundary where experience has shown that large numbers of illegal aliens can be detected attempting entry. A large number of agents so assigned are primarily concerned with responding to sensor alarms (electronic detection equipment) which are located at strategic positions. These agents also respond to citizen complaints concerning the suspected presence of deportable aliens.\n\n\n59\nIn fiscal 1973, there were 175,511 deportable aliens apprehended throughout the nation by agents assigned to the line watch, with 69,147 being apprehended in the Chula Vista sector and 5,908 in the El Centro sector.\n\n\n60\nWhile the Border Patrol would like to apprehend all deportable aliens right on the border by agents of the line watch, inspections at regular points of entry are not infallible and illegal crossings at other than legal ports of entry are numerous and recurring. The maintenance of continuous patrol over the vast stretches of the border in Southern California is physically impossible, since the approximately 145 miles of boundary creates geographic barriers to effective patrol and man-made devices such as fences and electronic devices are in large part ineffective.\n\n\n61\nIncreased manpower on line watch would not make that activity appreciably more effective as was demonstrated in 1969 during 'Operation Intercept' when many more agents were stationed immediately on the border, and yet, the number of illegal aliens apprehended by agents operating inland was not significantly different from like periods when such additional manpower was not located at the boundary.\n\n\n62\nOnce the aliens negotiate their way through the port of entry or, as is most common, walk across the border at a place other than an official port of entry, they find transportation inland either in public conveyances, or private vehicles with increasing numbers being transported by professional smugglers. A few have been known to walk some distance inland and have been apprehended after having walked as far north as Julian, California, which is over 60 miles from the border.\n\n\n63\nAfter crossing the line watch some illegal aliens seek employment in the Southern District, but the vast majority attempt to proceed to Los Angeles County and points north.\n\n\n64\nOnce the illegal alien gets settled in a big city far away from the border it becomes very difficult to apprehend him, and therefore, the Border Patrol attempts to contain the illegal entrant within this district. Aliens in California at 7. With this objective in mind, they have (pursuant to their statutory authority discussed above) established, since at least 1927, strategically located traffic inspection facilities, commonly referred to as checkpoints, on highways and roads, for the purpose of questioning vehicle occupants believed to be aliens, as to their right to be, or to remain, in the United States, and also to search such vehicles for illegal aliens. Immigration and Naturalization Service Border Patrol Handbook 9\u20141 (1972) (hereinafter cited as Handbook).\n\n\n65\nThe primary objective of the checkpoints is to intercept vehicles or conveyances transporting illegal aliens, or nonresident aliens admitted with temporary border passing cards (I 186), with particular attention being paid to vehicles operated by smugglers or transporters destined for inland cities in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324.\n\n\n66\nThe selection of the location of a checkpoint is determined by factors relevant to the interdiction or interception of deportable aliens who have succeeded in gaining entry in an unlawful manner or are proceeding beyond the immediate border area in violation of conditions of their admission as border crossers, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.60. The primary factors in selecting a checkpoint site are:\n\n\n67\n1. A location on a highway just beyond the confluence of two or more roads from the border, in order to permit the checking of a large volume of traffic with a minimum number of officers. This also avoids the inconvenience of repeated checking of commuter or urban traffic which would occur if the sites were operated on the network of roads leading from and through the more populated areas near the border.\n\n\n68\n2. Terrain and topography that restrict passage of vehicles around the checkpoint, such as mountains, desert, and, as in the case of the San Clemente checkpoint, the Camp Pendleton Marine Base.\n\n\n69\n3. Safety factors: an unobstructed view of oncoming traffic, to provide a safe distance for slowing and stopping; parking space off the highway; power source to illuminate control signs and inspection area, and bypass capability for vehicles not requiring examination.\n\n\n70\n4. Due to the travel restrictions of the I\u2014186 nonresident border crosser to an area 25 miles from the border (unless issued additional documentation) the checkpoints, as a general rule, are located at a point beyond the 25 mile zone in order to control the unlawful movement inland of such visitors.\n\n\n71\nStrategic sites that meet the foregoing enumerated criteria are selected for 'permanent checkpoints.' These are sites equipped to handle a large volume of traffic on what would be a 24-hour basis except in case of manpower shortage, poor weather, or where traffic becomes excessive causing a potential safety hazard. Handbook at 9\u20143.\n\n\n72\nOther traffic checkpoints, known as 'temporary checkpoints' are maintained on roads where traffic is less frequent. The placement of these sites will be governed by the same safety factors as involved in permanent site placement and are usually located where the terrain allows an element of surprise. Operations at these temporary checkpoints are set up at irregular intervals and intermittently so as to confuse the potential violator. Handbook at 9\u20143.\n\n\n73\nWhen the checkpoints, whether permanent or temporary, are in operation, an officer standing at the 'point' in full dress uniform on the highway will view the decelerating oncoming vehicles and their passengers, and will visually determine whether he has reason to believe the occupants of the vehicle are aliens (i.e., 'breaks the pattern' of usual traffic). If so, the vehicle will be stopped (if the traffic at the checkpoint is heavy, as at the San Clemente checkpoint, the vehicle will be actually directed off the highway) for inquiries to be made by the agent. If the agent does not have reason to believe that the vehicle approaching the checkpoint is carrying aliens, he may exchange salutations, or merely wave the vehicle through the checkpoint.\n\n\n74\nIf, after questioning the occupants, the agent then believes that illegal aliens may be secreted in the vehicle (because of a break in the 'pattern' indicating the possibility of smuggling) he will inspect the vehicle by giving a cursory visual inspection of those areas of the vehicle not visible from the outside (i.e. trunk, interior portion of camper, etc.).\n\n\n75\nAt the point of location of the sites now in regular use few aliens have reached the locale on foot, with 99 percent having entered a vehicle of one type or another. Approximately 12 percent of all apprehensions of deportable aliens throughout the nation are made at checkpoints.\n\n\n76\nIn the United States, during fiscal 1973, approximately 55,300 deportable aliens were apprehended by Border Patrol agents working traffic checking operations. In the Chula Vista sector the number for that period was 21,232, while in the El Centro sector the total was 3,825.2 During fiscal 1973, a total of 4,975 of the above were visitors apprehended at the checkpoints and a majority of these were those who were in violation of the terms of temporary border passes (Form I\u2014186).\n\n\n77\nThe placement of the checkpoints and their operations are coordinated between the two sectors located in this district and with Border Patrol activities to the east in Arizona. In actual operation the checkpoints, be they 'permanent' or 'temporary,' have the same basic accouterments. Typically, about one-half mile to one mile south of the checkpoint is the first notification that the checkpoint is ahead. The notice is in the form of a black on yellow sign indicated 'STOP AHEAD' which has floodlights for nighttime illumination, handbook at 9\u20149. Next, about 200 yards from the checkpoint is another sign cautioning the traffic to slow down or to be careful; this sign usually has flashing yellow lights attached. For the fifty yards directly south of the checkpoint there are placed traffic cones evenly spaced along each side of the highway. The actual checkpoint has a sign indicating to the traffic to stop, with official Border Patrol vehicles parked on each side of the stop zone showing the official Border Patrol emblem and\/or the designation U.S. OFFICERS. At this point the agents assigned at the 'point,' in their official uniform, conduct checking and inspection operations. Beyond the checkpoint is usually a sign indicating 'THANK YOU.'\n\n\n78\nWhile a large number of apprehensions are made at the checkpoints each year, as related above, the primary reason for their operation is that they effectively deter large numbers of aliens from illegally entering the country or violating the terms of any temporary crossing card they may have, because they form an effective obstacle and are located on all major routes north out of the border region.\n\n\n79\nThe deterrence aspect of these traffic checkpoint operations is amply demonstrated by the fact that the illegal alien has to resort to the employment of professional smugglers to provide transportation around or through these checkpoints.\n\n\n80\nSome of these smuggling operations have developed into sophisticated and involved operations with the following general modus operandi:\n\n\n81\n1. Contact is made between the smuggler and the alien prior to the latter's leaving Mexico.\n\n\n82\n2. The aliens then make entry on foot, with possibly the aid of a 'guide,' or by use of temporary border passes. Then they enter vehicles approximately 2 or 20 miles inland after having passed through the Border Patrol's line watch activities.\n\n\n83\n3. To get through the traffic checkpoint they might use a 'drop house,' which acts as a staging area to keep the aliens awaiting inclement weather, or any event that might cause the checkpoint to close down temporarily. Or, they may use a 'decoy' vehicle, which is a vehicle loaded with illegal aliens which it is anticipated will be stopped at the checkpoint and would therefore occupy the agents so that other vehicles could pass through without inspection. They even use 'scout cars' to probe those roads where temporary checkpoints are maintained, so as to advise other vehicles whether it is safe to proceed.\n\n\n84\n4. The 'load' vehicles themselves can be of any type of conveyance and the methods used to secrete aliens inside them are varied and often show some originality. Unfortunately, sometimes these are very dangerous to the aliens themselves. It has been reported, for example, that it is not at all unusual for an alien to die from asphyxiation while concealed in an automobile trunk or a tank car.\n\n\n85\n5. The cost of the transportation provided to the aliens is approximately $225 to $250 for each alien for the trip through the checkpoint on to the Los Angeles area. Since smuggling operations are almost exclusively 'cash and carry' businesses and the average income among Mexican nationals who may wish to seek residence here illegally is quite small, this cost tends to act as a very significant deterrent in and of itself. The checkpoints are the major reason for such a high price and if they were discontinued for any length of time it would be one more encouragement to illegal immigration.\n\n\n86\nThe deterrent impact of these checkpoints has been noted on several occasions when they resumed operation unexpectedly and a great number of aliens were apprehended.\n\n\n87\nThe evidence presented before this court clearly established that there is no reasonable or effective alternative method of detection and apprehension avilable to the Border Patrol in the absence of the checkpoints, for even a geometric increase in its personnel or line watch would not leave any control over those admitted as temporary visitors from Mexico.\n\n\n88\nOf the approximately half million illegal aliens apprehended in fiscal 1973, virtually none were prosecuted, unless they presented counterfeit or altered documents or aided in smuggling endeavors.\n\n\n89\nThis district has only 3 percent of the total length of land borders, and yet fully 30 percent of all apprehensions of deportable aliens made in the United States are made within this district.\n\n\n90\nMr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice BLACKMUN joins, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n91\nGiven Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973), with which I disagreed but which is now authoritative the results reached in these cases were largely foreordained. The Court purports to leave the question open, but it seems to me, my Brother REHNQUIST notwithstanding, that under the Court's opinions checkpoint investigative stops, without search, will be difficult to justify under the Fourth Amendment absent probable cause or reasonable suspicion. In any event, the Court has thus dismantled major parts of the apparantus by which the Nation has attempted to intercept millions of aliens who enter and remain illegally in this country.\n\n\n92\nThe entire system, however, has been notably unsuccessful in deterring or stemming this heavy flow; and its costs, including added burdens on the courts, have been substantial. Perhaps the Judiciary should not strain to accommodate the requirements of the Fourth Amendment to the needs of a system which at best can demonstrate only minimal effectiveness as long as it is lawful for business firms and others to employ aliens who are illegally in the country. This problem, which ordinary law enforcement has not been able to solve, essentially poses questions of national policy and is chiefly the business of Congress and the Executive Branch rather than the courts.\n\n\n93\nI concur in the judgment in these two cases.\n\n\n\n*\n The syllabus consitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader. See United States v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U.S. 321, 337, 26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50 L.Ed. 499.\n\n\n1\n Such places typically include the trunk, under the hood, and beneath the chassis. If the vehicle is a truck, a camper, or the like, the officer inspects the enclosed portion as well. But an immigration inspection is not always so confined. In Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973), the officer removed the back seat cushion because there were reports that aliens had been found seated upright behind seats from which the springs had been removed. Id., at 286, 93 S.Ct., at 2546 (White, J., dissenting).\n\n\n2\n The degree of the invasion of privacy in an automobile search may vary with the circumstances, as there are significant differences between 'an automobile and a home or office.' Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42, 48, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 1979, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970); Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U.S., at 279, 93 S.Ct., at 2542 (Powell, J., concurring).\n\n\n3\n Not every aspect of a routine automobile 'inspection,' as described in n. 1, supra, necessarily constitutes a 'search' for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. There is no occasion in this case to define the exact limits of an automobile 'search.'\nNor do we have occasion to decide whether a warrant could issue approving checkpoint searches based on information about the area as a whole, in the absence of cause to believe that a particular car is carrying concealed aliens, because the officers had no such warrant in this case and had not tried to obtain one. See Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U.S., at 275, 93 S.Ct., at 2540 (Powell, J., concurring); Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967). We also need not decide whether checkpoints and roving patrols must be treated the same for all purposes, or whether Border Patrol officers may lawfully stop motorists for questioning at an established checkpoint without reason to believe that a particular vehicle is carrying aliens. Cf. United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607. Nor do we suggest that probable cause would be required for all inspections of private motor vehicles. It is quite possible, for example, that different considerations would apply to routine safety inspections required as a condition of road use.\n\n\n1\n The Court today recognizes that as many as 12 million illegal aliens are now present in this country. United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S., at 878, and n. 4, 95 S.Ct., at 2578 2579. See also U.S. News and World Report, July 22, 1974, p. 27; id., Dec. 9, 1974, p. 77. By all indications the problem will increase in the future, not abate. United States v. Baca, 368 F.Supp. 398, 402\u2014403 (SD Cal.1973). In the Baca case Judge Turrentine conducted a thorough review of the entire problem and the present Government response. Appended to this opinion is an excerpt from Judge Turrentine's Baca opinion describing the illegal alien problem and the law enforcement response.\n\n\n2\n For example, testimony in the Baca hearings revealed that a complement of 21,000 officers would be needed to control adequately the 75 miles of border in the El Centro sector alone.\n\n\n1\n The notation 'INS' when used herein has reference to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n\n\n2\n Apparently apprehensions other than those actually made at the checkpoint are included in these figures, but they are a representation of the total activity at these checkpoints and the majority of apprehensions included therein are made at the checkpoints (R.T. 274, 396).\n\n\n","label":0}

Rissman and Fred Okrand, Los Angeles, Cal., for petitioner.\nMr. Roger G. Connor, Juneau, Alaska, for respondent.\nMr. Justice HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner was tried and convicted of knowingly transporting a woman in interstate commerce for the purpose of prostitution, in violation of the White Slave Traffic Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2421. At the trial, the woman, who had since the date of the offense married the petitioner, was ordered, over her objection and that of the petitioner, to testify on behalf of the prosecution.1 The Court of Appeals, on appeal from a judgment of conviction, affirmed the ruling of the District Court. 263 F.2d 304. As the case presented significant issues concerning the scope and nature of the privilege against adverse spousal testimony, treated last Term in Hawkins v. United States, 358 U.S. 74, 79 S.Ct. 136, 3 L.Ed.2d 125, we granted certiorari. 360 U.S. 908, 79 S.Ct. 1299, 3 L.Ed.2d 1259. We affirm the judgment.\n\n\n2\nFirst. Our decision in Hawkins established, for the federal courts, the continued validity of the common-law rule of evidence ordinarily permitting a party to exclude the adverse testimony of his or her spouse. However, as that case expressly acknowledged, the common law has long recognized an exception in the case of certain kinds of offenses committed by the party against his spouse. Id., 358 U.S. at page 75, 79 S.Ct. at page 137, citing Stein v. Bowman, 13 Pet. 209, 221, 10 L.Ed. 129. Exploration of the precise breadth of this exception, a matter of some uncertainty, see 8 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.), \u00a7 2239, can await a case where it is necessary. For present purposes it is enough to note that every Court of Appeals which has considered the specific question now holds that the exception, and not the rule, applies to a Mann Act prosecution, where the defendant's wife was the victim of the offense.2 Such unanimity with respect to a rule of evidence lends weighty credentials to that view.\n\n\n3\nWhile this Court has never before decided the question, we now unhesitatingly approve the rule followed in five different Circuits. We need not embark upon an extended consideration of the asserted bases for the spousal privilege (see Hawkins, supra, 358 U.S. at pages 77\u201478, 79 S.Ct. at pages 138\u2014139; Wigmore, op. cit., supra, \u00a7 2228(3)) and an appraisal of the applicability of each here, id., \u00a7 2239, for it cannot be seriously argued that one who has committed this 'shameless offense against wifehood,' id., at p. 257, should be permitted to prevent his wife from testifying to the crime by invoking an interest founded on the marital relation or the desire of the law to protect it. Petitioner's attempt to prevent his wife from testifying, by invoking an asserted privilege of his own, was properly rejected.\n\n\n4\nSecond. The witness-wife, however, did not testify willingly, but objected to being questioned by the prosecution, and gave evidence only upon the ruling of the District Court denying her claimed privilege not to testify. We therefore consider the correctness of that ruling.3\n\n\n5\nThe United States argues that, once having held, as we do, that in such a case as this the petitioner's wife could not be prevented from testifying voluntarily, Hawkins establishes that she may be compelled to testify. For, it is said, that case specifically rejected any distinction between voluntary and compelled testimony. 358 U.S. at page 77, 79 S.Ct. at page 138. This argument fails to take account of the setting of our decision in Hawkins. To say that a witness-spouse may be prevented from testifying voluntarily simply means that the party has a privilege to exclude the testimony;4 when, on the other hand, the spouse may not be compelled to testify against her will, it is the witness who is accorded a privilege. In Hawkins, the Government took the position that the spousal privilege should be that of the witness, and not that of the party, so that while the wife could decline to testify, she could not be prevented from giving evidence if she elected not to claim a privilege which, it was said, belonged to her alone. Brief for the United States, No. 20, O.T.1958, pp. 22 43. In declining to hold that the party had no privilege, we manifestly did not thereby repudiate the privilege of the witness.\n\n\n6\nWhile the question has not often arisen, it has apparently been generally assumed that the privilege resided in the witness as well as in the party. Hawkins referred to 'a rule which bars the testimony of one spouse against the other unless both consent,' supra, 358 U.S. at page 78, 79 S.Ct. at page 138. (Emphasis supplied.) See Stein v. Bowman, supra, 13 Pet. at page 223 (wife cannot 'by force of authority be compelled to state facts in evidence'); United States v. Mitchell, supra, 137 F.2d at page 1008 ('the better view is that the privilege is that of either spouse who chooses to claim it'); Wigmore, op. cit., supra, \u00a7 2241; McCormick, Evidence, \u00a7 66, n. 3. In its Hawkins brief, the Government, while calling for the abolition of the party's privilege, urged that the commonlaw development could be explained, and its policies fully vindicated, by recognition of the privilege of the witness. Brief, pp. 22\u201425, 33, 42\u201443; see Hawkins, supra, 358 U.S. at pages 77, and concurring opinion, at page 82, 79 S.Ct. at pages 139, 141. At least some of the bases of the party's privilege are in reason applicable to that of the witness. As Wigmore puts it, op. cit., supra, at p. 264: '(W)hile the defendant-husband is entitled to be protected against condemnation through the wife's testimony, the witness-wife is also entitled to be protected against becoming the instrument of that condemnation,\u2014the sentiment in each case being equal in degree and yet different in quality.' In light of these considerations, we decline to accept the view that the privilege is that of the party alone.\n\n\n7\nThird. Neither can we hold that, whenever the privilege is unavailable to the party, it is ipso facto lost to the witness as well. It is a question in each case, or in each category of cases, whether, in light of the reason which has led to a refusal to recognize the party's privilege, the witness should be held compellable. Certainly, we would not be justified in laying down a general rule that both privileges stand or fall together. We turn instead to the particular situation at bar.\n\n\n8\nWhere a man has prostituted his own wife, he has committed an offense against both her and the marital relation, and we have today affirmed the exception disabling him from excluding her testimony against him. It is suggested, however, that this exception has no application to the witness-wife when she chooses to remain silent. The exception to the party's privilege, it is said, rests on the necessity of preventing the defendant from sealing his wife's lips by his own unlawful act, see United States v. Mitchell, supra, 137 F.2d at pages 1008\u20141009; Wigmore, op cit., supra, \u00a7 2239, and it is argued that where the wife has chosen not to 'become the instrument' of her husband's downfall, it is her own privilege which is in question, and the reasons for according it to her in the first place are fully applicable.\n\n\n9\nWe must view this position in light of the congressional judgment and policy embodied in the Mann Act. 'A primary purpose of the Mann Act was to protect women who were weak from men who were bad.' Denning v. United States, 5 Cir., 247 F. 463, 465. It was in response to shocking revelations of subjugation of women too weak to resist that Congress acted. See H.R.Rep. No. 47, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 10\u201411. As the legislative history discloses, the Act reflects the supposition that the women with whom it sought to deal often had no independent will of their own, and embodies, in effect, the view that they must be protected against themselves. Compare 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2422 (consent of woman immaterial in prosecution under that section). It is not for us to re-examine the basis of that supposition.\n\n\n10\nApplying the legislative judgment underlying the Act, we are led to hold it not an allowable choice for a prostituted witness-wife 'voluntarily' to decide to protect her husband by declining to testify against him. For if a defendant can induce a woman, against her 'will,' to enter a life of prostitution for his benefit\u2014and the Act rests on the view that he can\u2014by the same token it should be considered that he can, at least as easily, persuade one who has already fallen victim to his influence that she must also protect him. To make matters turn upon ad hoc inquiries into the actual state of mind of particular women, thereby encumbering Mann Act trials with a collateral issue of the greatest subtlety, is hardly an acceptable solution.\n\n\n11\nFourth. What we have already said likewise governs the disposition of the petitioner's reliance on the fact that his marriage took place after the commission of the offense. Again, we deal here only with a Mann Act prosecution, and intimate no view on the applicability of the privilege of either a party or a witness similarly circumstanced in other situations. The legislative assumption of lack of independent will applies as fully here. As the petitioner by his power over the witness could, as we have considered should be assumed, have secured her promise not to testify, so, it should be assumed, could he have induced her to go through a marriage ceremony with him, perhaps 'in contemplation of evading justice by reason of the very rule which is now sought to be invoked.' United States v. Williams, D.C., 55 F.Supp. 375, 380.\n\n\n12\nThe ruling of the District Court was correctly upheld by the Court of Appeals.5\n\n\n13\nAffirmed.\n\n\n14\nMr. Chief Justice WARREN, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS join, dissenting.\n\n\n15\nLast Term this Court held that a wife could not voluntarily testify against her husband in a criminal prosecution over his objection. Hawkins v. United States, 358 U.S. 74, 79 S.Ct. 136, 3 L.Ed.2d 125. The Court finds the case at bar so different from Hawkins that it approves overriding not only the husband's objection, but also the wife's. In both cases the husband was prosecuted for violation of the Mann Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2421. The only relevant difference is that here the wife herself was the person allegedly transported by the husband for purposes of prostitution. Morally speaking, this profanation of the marriage relationship adds an element of the utmost depravity to the ugly business of promoting prostitution. Legally speaking, however, this does not warrant the radical departure from the Hawkins rule which the Court now sanctions.\n\n\n16\nThe Court's analysis of the problem here presented is sound in so many ways that the unsoundness of its conclusion is especially disappointing\u2014and somewhat curious. Briefly, that analysis appears to be as follows: The Court accepts the principle that the spousal privilege belongs both to the person charged with the offense, as we held in Hawkins, and also to the witness. Moreover, the Court rejects the notion that the latter may be barred from asserting the privilege simply because, in a given case, it may be improper for the former to invoke it. The defendant may not claim the privilege where he is charged with 'certain kinds of offenses committed * * * against his spouse,' and the Court believes that the instant case involves this type of crime. It apparently recognizes, moreover, that the policy behind this exception may be effectuated in the ordinary situation by giving the injured party the option to testify, without compelling her to testify.1 In this case, however, it concludes that the wife 'should be assumed' to be under the sway of the husband to such an extent that she cannot be entrusted with that choice. Consequently, the trial court\u2014and the prosecutor\u2014must be given the power to protect her against herself by forcing her to testify.\n\n\n17\nThe fatal defect in this conclusion lies in the Court's evaluation of the mental state of the wife, an evaluation which finds no support in the record and which cannot properly be justified by any legislative enactment.\n\n\n18\nThe Court does not and could not rely upon the record to prove that petitioner's wife was somehow mesmerized by him when she was on the witness stand. The evidence, in point of fact, strongly suggests that the wife played a managerial role in the sordid enterprise which formed the basis for the prosecution.2 Apparently this was the jury's view, since the jurors asked the judge whether it would 'make any difference or\u2014if the woman had anything to do with the instigation or planning * * * .' The judge, of course, instructed then that this would be immaterial, but the jury nevertheless unanimously recommended leniency. Thus this case is a strange vehicle for the Court to use in announcing its 'lack of independent will' theory. Presumably it is to be regarded as the exception which proves the rule.\n\n\n19\nThe sole ground assigned by the Court for its decision is that it is a necessary application of the 'legislative judgment underlying the (Mann) Act,' which 'reflects the supposition that the women with whom (Congress) sought to deal often had no independent will of their own, and embodies, in effect, the view that they must be protected against themselves.' In support of this hypothesis, the Court cites legislative history and the fact that, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2422, a companion provision to \u00a7 2421, the consent of the woman does not relieve the defendant of criminal responsibility.3 This equation of the legislative judgment involved in fashioning a criminal statute with the judgment involved in the Court's restriction of the husband-wife privilege is, I submit, entirely too facile, for it overlooks the critically different nature of these problems. In assessing the pertinence of the woman's consent to the culprit's criminal responsibility, Congress chose between the interest of society in eradicating the importation and interstate transportation of prostitutes and the interest of women to be protected from clever and unscrupulous profiteers, on the one hand, and the voluntary engagement of women in prostitution on the other. In view of the manifest imbalance of these competing considerations and the difficulty of definition and proof of the type of consent which might conceivably be relevant, it is hardly surprising that Congress passed the Mann Act and made consent entirely immaterial under \u00a7 2422. The testimonial privilege, however, presents questions of quite a different order, since there is a significant interest traditionally regarded as supporting the privilege, as we recognized in Hawkins\u2014the preservation of the conjugal relationship. And where the wife refuses to testify, there is strong evidence that there is still a marital relationship to be protected.\n\n\n20\nNot only does prior congressional action provide no support for the Court's decision, but without such support that decision represents an incursion into what is essentially a legislative area. It is true, of course, that federal courts have the authority to interpret the common-law principles of evidence 'in the light of reason and experience.' Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. rule 26, 18 U.S.C.A. This authority, however, must be exercised with a discriminating awareness of the distinction between matters which fall within the special competence of the judiciary and those which are primarily the concern of the legislature. It is more properly Congress' business, not ours, to place comparative values upon the quest for facts in the judicial process as against the safeguarding of the marriage relationship, and to give\u2014or deny expression to what has been termed 'a natural repugnance in every fair-minded person to compelling a wife or husband to be the means of the other's condemnation, and to compelling the culprit to the humiliation of being condemned by the words of his intimate life-partner.' 8 Wigmore, Evidence, 227. That this decision is uniquely legislative and not judicial is demonstrated by the fact that, both in England and in this country, changes in the common-law privilege have been wrought primarily by legislatures.4 And perhaps it is worth noting that the essentials of the privilege have survived with remarkable sturdiness through the course of continued consideration by legislative bodies.5\n\n\n21\nOf particular interest is the past action and attitude of Congress with respect to the privilege. As the Court pointed out in Hawkins, in 1887 Congress passed a statute which permitted either spouse to testify in prosecutions of the other for the crimes of bigamy, polygamy, or unlawful cohabitation, but stipulated that neither should be compelled to testify. 24 Stat. 635. Apparently Congress believed that this provision gave sufficient protection to the spouse-witness, and that the interest of the State in securing convictions was outweighed by the considerations supporting the right of the spouse-witness not to testify against her will. Even more in point is the 1917 legislation by which Congress made spouses competent to testify against each other in prosecutions for the importation of aliens for immoral purposes. 39 Stat. 878\u2014879, re-enacted as 66 Stat. 230, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1328, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1328. Thus Congress has acted with respect to the scope of the privilege in prosecutions under a statute kindred to \u00a7 2421, but has remained silent so far as \u00a7 2421 itself is concerned. The negative implication does not require elaboration.6 Moreover, it should be noted that even under \u00a7 1328 the testimony of the spouse is made only 'admissible and competent,' not compellable.7\n\n\n22\nIn my judgment, the Court in this case strays from the course of appropriate judicial reserve marked by Hawkins. I am unwilling to join in a decision based upon an assumption of fact which is without support in the record and which involves a delicate, and essentially legislative determination. I therefore dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n Although the record is ambiguous as to the fact and time of petitioner's marriage, we shall consider established, as the Court of Appeals did, the sequence of events stated in the text. Further, the Court of Appeals noted that, while the record did not clearly establish that the petitioner, as well as his wife, claimed a privilege with respect to her testimony, it would assume that he had. 263 F.2d 304, 308. We accept that assumption.\n\n\n2\n United States v. Mitchell, 2 Cir., 137 F.2d 1006; Levine v. United States, 5 Cir., 163 F.2d 992; Shores v. United States, 8 Cir., 174 F.2d 838, 11 A.L.R.2d 635, overruling Johnson v. United States, 8 Cir., 221 F. 250; Pappas v. United States, 9 Cir., 241 F. 665; Hayes v. United States, 10 Cir., 168 F.2d 996.\n\n\n3\n The United States does not question the standing of petitioner to seek reversal because of the allegedly erroneous refusal to respect the privilege of his wife. Since such testimony, even if wrongly compelled, is per se admissible, Funk v. United States, 290 U.S. 371, 54 S.Ct. 212, 78 L.Ed. 369, and relevant, it has been argued that the party has suffered no injury of which he may complain. Wigmore, op. cit., supra, \u00a7 2196(2)(a); McCormick, Evidence, \u00a7 73; Uniform Rules of Evidence, Rule 40; Am.L.Inst. Model Code of Evidence, Rule 234; Note, 30 Col.L.Rev. 686, 693\u2014694. See, e.g., Turner v. State, 60 Miss. 351, 353. However, as the point has not been briefed or argued, we have thought it appropriate, in view of our disposition of the case on the merits, not to consider the issue of standing, and of course intimate no view on it.\n\n\n4\n Funk v. United States, supra, abolished, for the federal courts, the disqualification or incompetence of the spouse as a witness, thus establishing the admissibility of his or her testimony, and leaving the question one of privilege only.\n\n\n5\n The petitioner's further assertion, that apart from the testimony of the wife there was insufficient corroboration of his admission of transportation, thus fails by its own assumption.\n\n\n1\n Perhaps the Court is merely assuming this to be true arguendo. Since the basic purpose of the exception is to prevent the husband from abusing the wife with impunity, the assumption is amply warranted. See, e.g., Lord Audley's Trial, 3 How.St.Tr. 401, 402, 414 (1631); Bentley v. Cooke, 3 Doug. 422, 424 (1784) ('(T)hat necessity is not a general necessity, as where no other witness can be had, but a particular necessity, as where, for instance, the wife would otherwise be exposed without remedy to personal injury.' Mansfield, L.C.J.); 8 Wigmore, Evidence (3rd ed.), \u00a7 2239; Comment, 4 Ark.L.Rev. & Bar Assn.J. 426, 427; Note, 38 Va.L.Rev. 359, 361. All that is necessary to fulfill this purpose is to provide the injured spouse with the means for redress. If she chooses not to utilize that means, there is no greater justification for compelling her testimony in such a case than there is in the normal situation. Although there is concededly authority to the contrary, in my view it is not well reasoned. Since the Court does not disagree, it is unnecessary at this time to discuss the matter in detail.\n\n\n2\n The most important testimony regarding the petitioner's purpose in providing for his wife's transportation was given by a hotel bellboy, who related various conversations which he had with petitioner. The clerk also testified as to his conversations with the wife, and there is little if anything to distinguish the evidence relating to the wife from that relating to the husband.\n\n\n3\n Section 2421, generally speaking, makes it a crime (a) to transport in interstate or foreign commerce any woman for the purpose of prostitution or other immoral purpose, or with the intent of inducing her to engage in prostitution or other immoral practice, and (b) to secure interstate or foreign transportation for any woman for the above purposes or with the above intent. Section 2422, generally speaking, makes it a crime to induce a woman to travel on common carriers in interstate or foreign commerce for the above purposes or with the above intent.\n\n\n4\n Every State has a statute governing the matter. For discussion of these statutes, see 3 Vernier, American Family Laws, 585\u2014586; 2 Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 488, 8 id., \u00a7 2245; 43 Marq.L.Rev. 131, 132; 33 Tulane L.Rev. 884; Note, 38 Va.L.Rev. 359. The many differences among these statutes is further evidence of the divergent views which may be held with respect to the relative importance of the factors involved. It is interesting to note in this connection that apparently only a small minority of States have passed statutes which make the wife competent to testify in a prosecution against her husband for pandering or white slavery when she is the female involved, and only some of these make her compellable as well as competent. See, e.g., Me.Rev.Stat.1954, c. 134, \u00a7 22; Ore.Comp.Laws Ann.1940, \u00a7 23\u2014921; Utah Code Ann.1943, \u00a7 103\u201451\u201414; Va.Code 1950, \u00a7 18\u201497; W.Va.Code Ann.1955, \u00a7\u00a7 6062, 6063. See also Note, 38 Va.L.Rev. 359, 366. Nor does the comprehensive British legislation give comfort to the Court. For a description of these statutes, see Evidence of Spouses in Criminal Cases, 99 Sol.J. 551. See also Nokes, Evidence, A Century Of Family Law (Graveson and Crane ed.), 146\u2014149; Scots L.T. (1956), 145. Compare Leach v. Rex, (1912) A.C. 305, with Rex v. Lapworth, (1931) 1 K.B. 117. The experience of the Alabama Supreme Court is instructive. That court, in an 'exception of necessity' case, held that the wife was not only competent to testify, but also compellable. Johnson v. State, 94 Ala. 53, 10 So. 427. The Alabama Legislature, however, abolished this decision by statute. Ala.Code, 1940, Tit. 15, \u00a7 311.\n\n\n5\n See the sources cited in note 4, supra. To be sure, the privilege has been strongly attacked by commentators, most of whom rely upon Wigmore's treatise. Wigmore's lengthy criticism of the privilege is best summarized in his own words:\n'This privilege has no longer any good reason for retention. In an age which has so far rationalized, depolarized, and de-chivalrized the marital relation and the spirit of Femininity as to be willing to enact complete legal and political equality and independence of man and woman, this marital privilege is the merest anachronism, in legal theory, and an indefensible obstruction to truth, in practice.' 8 Wigmore, Evidence, 232.\nIt is arguable that this is as much an ipse dixit as the statements in favor of the rule which Wigmore criticizes upon that very ground. Id., at 226\u2014228. In any event, it is evident that his conclusion involves value judgments which the legislature is far better adapted to accept or reject than the judiciary.\nFor a view contrasting with Wigmore's, see Bassett v. United States, 137 U.S. 496, 505\u2014506, 11 S.Ct. 165, 167, 34 L.Ed. 762, where this Court narrowly construed a legislative provision regarding the privilege:\n'We do not doubt the power of the legislature to change this ancient and well-supported rule; but an intention to make such a change should not lightly be imputed. It cannot be assumed that it is indifferent to sacred things, or that it means to lower the holy relations of husband and wife to the material plane of simple contract. So, before any departure from the rule affirmed through the ages of the common law * * * can be adjudged, the language declaring the legislative will should be so clear as to prevent doubt as to its intent and limit.'\n\n\n6\n The nature of relevant action by Congress and by the state legislatures, see note 4, supra, distinguishes this case from Funk v. United States, 290 U.S. 371, 54 S.Ct. 212, 78 L.Ed. 369, which held that one spouse was competent to testify on behalf of the other in a criminal trial. As the Court there pointed out, the dispualification was based upon interest, and '(t)he rules of the common law which disqualified as witnesses persons having an interest, long since, in the main, have been abolished both in England and in this country * * *.' Id., 290 U.S. at page 380, 54 S.Ct. at page 215. The contrast between this case and Funk, where the Court was able to rely upon 'the general current of legislation and of judicial opinion,' id., 290 U.S. at page 381, 54 S.Ct. at page 215, is striking. In this connection, perhaps it should be emphasized that the federal decisions cited in note 2 of the Court's opinion stand, as the Court indicates, only for the proposition that a Mann Act prosecution falls within the common-law exception so that the wife may testify, and not for the rule that a wife in such a case may be compelled to testify. But see Shores v. United States, 174 F.2d 838, 841, where the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit stated in dicta that the wife may be compelled to testify in any exception case\u2014a view much broader than that here adopted by this Court.\n\n\n7\n This seems to be the plain meaning of the statutory language, though similar language in state statutes has received both broad and narrow constructions. Compare McCormick v. State, 135 Tenn. 218, 186 S.W. 95, L.R.A.1916F. 382, with Richardson v. State, 103 Md. 112, 117, 63 A. 317, 319\u2014320. For the view of an English court, see Leach v. Rex, (1912), A.C. 305, 311 (not compellable) ('The principle that a wife is not to be compelled to give evidence against her husband is deep seated in the common law of this country, and I think if it is to be overturned it must be overturned by a clear, definite, and positive enactment, not by an ambiguous one * * *' Lord Atkinson).

Ratner, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nLouis F. Claiborne, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner, a pauper, has been convicted and sentenced to prison. After conviction the court-appointed lawyer, who represented him at the trial, withdrew his appearance with the approval of the court. The present court-appointed attorney is a different person, appointed by the Court of Appeals after the indigent had prepared pro se a petition for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. The District Court denied leave to appeal in forma pauperis. The Court of Appeals, although empowered to allow the appeal (Coppedge v. United States, 369 U.S. 438, 455, 82 S.Ct. 917, 926, 8 L.Ed.2d 21), merely allowed petitioner to proceed in forma pauperis for purposes of the appeal 'to the extent of having the stenographic transcript of the testimony and evidence presented by the government prepared at the expense of the United States,' as those parts of the transcript were the only ones that relate 'to the conclusory allegations' formulated by the indigent defendant pro se. See Ingram v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 283, 315 F.2d 29, 30\u201431. After a petition for rehearing was denied, petitioner moved the Court of Appeals for a transcript of the balance of the proceedings in the District Court. This motion was denied by a divided Bench. The case is here on certiorari. 373 U.S. 902, 83 S.Ct. 1293, 10 L.Ed.2d 198.\n\n\n2\nWe deal with the federal system where the appeal is a matter of right (Coppedge v. United States, supra, 369 U.S. at 441, 82 S.Ct. at 919, 8 L.Ed.2d 21; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 1294), and where the appellant is entitled to 'the aid of counsel unless he insists on being his own.' Johnson v. United States, 352 U.S. 565, 566, 77 S.Ct. 550, 551, 1 L.Ed.2d 593. Congress has buttressed that right of appeal in several ways. It has provided in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 that any federal court may authorize an 'appeal' in forma pauperis, except that such an appeal may not be taken if the trial court certifies that 'it is not taken in good faith.' Further, a transcript is available for appeal purposes, Congress having provided in the Court Reporter Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(b), that a transcript 'by shorthand or by mechanical means' of 'all proceedings in criminal cases had in open court' shall be made. The United States Attorney for the District of Columbia has adopted the practice of furnishing to indigents a full transcript on request if the cost to the United States is not more than $200.1 That policy draws a distinction not present in the statute nor in the Rules of the Court of Appeals which provide that, when the court allows an appeal in forma pauperis, it shall then determine 'whether, and to what extent, a transcript will be necessary for the proper determination of the appeal.' D.C.Cir.Rule 33(b)(2)(i).\n\n\n3\nWe have here a case where an appeal in forma pauperis has not yet been allowed. But whether counsel seeks an entire transcript at that stage or later on, the problem seems to us to be the same.\n\n\n4\nA court-appointed counsel who represents the indigent on appeal gets at public expense, as a minimum, the transcript which is relevant to the points of error assigned. Coppedge v. United States, supra, 369 U.S. at 446, 82 S.Ct. at 921\u2014922, 8 L.Ed.2d 21; Ingram v. United States, supra.2 But when, as here, new counsel represents the indigent on appeal, how can he faithfully discharge the obligation which the court has placed on him unless he can read the entire transcript? His duty may possibly not be discharged if he is allowed less than th t. For Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides: 'Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.' The right to notice 'plain errors or defects' is illusory if no transcript is available at least to one whose lawyer on appeal enters the case after the trial is ended.3\n\n\n5\nThe duty of counsel on appeal, as we noted in Ellis v. United States, 356 U.S. 674, 675, 78 S.Ct. 974, 975, 2 L.Ed.2d 1060, is not to serve as amicus to the Court of Appeals, but as advoca e for the appellant:\n\n\n6\n'Normally, allowance of an appeal should not be denied until      an indigent has had adequate representation by counsel.      Johnson v. United States, 352 U.S. 565, 77 S.Ct. 550, 1      L.Ed.2d 593. In this case, it appears that the two attorneys      appointed by the Court of Appeals, performed essentially the      role of amici curiae. But representation in the role of an      advocate is required. If counsel is convinced, after      conscientious investigation, that the appeal is frivolous, of      course, he may ask to withdraw on that account. If the court      is satisfied that counsel has diligently investigated the possible grounds of appeal, and agrees with counsel's      evaluation of the case, then leave to withdraw may be allowed      and leave to appeal may be denied.' (Italics added.)\n\n\n7\nWe deal here only with the statutory scheme and do not reach a consideration of constitutional requirements. We see no escape from the conclusion that either where the requirements of a nonfrivolous appeal prescribed by Coppedge v. United States, supra, are met, or where such a showing is sought to be made, and where counsel on appeal was not counsel at the trial, the requirements placed on him by Ellis v. United States, supra, will often make it seem necessary to him to obtain an entire transcript.\n\n\n8\nWe conclude that this counsel's duty cannot be discharged unless he has a transcript of the testimony and evidence presented by the defendant and also the court's charge to the jury, as well as the testimony and evidence presented by the prosecution.\n\n\n9\nReversed.\n\n\n10\nMr. Justice GOLDBERG, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice STEWART join, concurring.\n\n\n11\nI join the Court's opinion which is written narrowly within the framework of prior decisions. I concur separately, however, to state my conviction that in the interests of justice this Court should require, under our supervisory power, that full transcripts be provided, without limitation, in all federal criminal cases to defendants who cannot afford to purchase them, whenever they seek to prosecute an appeal.\n\n\n12\nThe problem here arises out of the different procedures by which criminal appeals taken by indigent and nonindigent defendants are processed in the District of Columbia and other federal courts. The procedure for nonindigents, who are represented by retained counsel and who are generally free on bail pending appeal, is automatic, direct and prompt. Within 10 days after judgment, counsel files a simple notice of appeal with the clerk of the District Court; a transcript is purchased and filed with the Court of Appeals; and the case is then automatically placed on the calendar for briefing and argument on the merits.1 The procedure for indigents, who are generally incarcerated pending appeal because of their inability to make bail,2 is indirect, dilatory and discretionary. A key difference is that while a nonindigent may appeal, in effect, as a matter of right, an indigent must make a showing that his claims of error are not frivolous before he is given permission to appeal. A brief description of the process by which the federal courts seek to screen frivolous attempts to appeal in forma pauperis is necessary to an understanding of the problem raised by this case.\n\n\n13\nFollowing the conviction and sentencing of an indigent defendant, his cou t-appointed trial lawyer often withdraws from the case.3 If the right to appeal is to be preserved, the defendant pro se must file a notice of appeal within 10 days after the entry of the judgment and must apply to the District Court for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. The application must include a statement of the alleged errors the defendant seeks to raise on appeal. Unless the District Court concludes that the appeal is not taken in 'good faith,' leave to appeal in forma pauperis must be granted. If the District Court denies leave to appeal in forma pauperis, the defendant, who, as previously noted, is often without the services of an attorney, may apply to the Court of Appeals for leave to appeal. If the Court of Appeals can determine from the application that a nonfrivolous claim of error exists, it must grant leave to appeal. If leave is granted, either by the District Court or the Court of Appeals, a lawyer is then appointed and supplied with the portions of the transcript relating to the nonfrivolous claims. If he then desires any additional portion of the transcript to help him prepare his appeal on the merits, he must ask the Court of Appeals to order its preparation.\n\n\n14\nIf the District Court has denied leave to appeal in forma pauperis, and if 'the claims made or the issues sought to be raised by the applicant are such that their substance cannot adequately be ascertained from the face of the defendant's application, the Court of Appeals must provide the would-be appellant with both the assistance of counsel and a record of sufficient completeness to enable him to attempt to make a showing * * *' that the case presents a nonfrivolous issue. Coppedge v. United States, 369 U.S. 438, 446, 82 S.Ct. 917, 921, 8 L.Ed.2d 21. A 'record of sufficient completeness' has been interpreted by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to mean 'the portion of the transcript of proceedings which relates to the conclusory allegations' made by the defendant in his pro se application. Ingram v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 283, 285, 315 F.2d 29, 31. After receiving the relevant portion of the transcript, the appointed lawyer has the duty of pre aring a memorandum showing, if he can, that the case presents a nonfrivolous issue and that leave to appeal should be granted. If the lawyer finds what he considers a nonfrivolous claim of error in the portion of the transcript he has been given, he files the memorandum. If the court then agrees that there is a nonfrivolous issue, it must grant leave to appeal in forma pauperis, and the same previously described procedure is then followed as would be followed if leave had been granted originally by the District Court or the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n15\nIf the lawyer has examined the portions of the transcript relating to the pro se claims of error and has satisfied himself that they contain no issue which he can assert to be nonfrivolous, he then has these alternatives. Deeming his appointed function exhausted, the attorney may seek leave from the Court of Appeals to withdraw from the case on the ground that he is satisfied that the case presents no issue which is nonfrivolous.4 If leave to withdraw is granted, a new lawyer is generally not appointed, and the defendant is informed that he may submit his own memorandum in support of his application. Since the pro se memorandum will rarely add anything to the original application, once the lawyer is given leave to withdraw denial of the defendant's application is virtually inevitable\n\n\n16\nThe lawyer who has satisfied himself that the transcript originally ordered contains no nonfrivolous issue may, however, decide to request additional portions of the transcript before seeking to withdraw from the case. If his examination of the original portions of the transcript leads him to suspect specific error in other portions of the transcript, the Court of Appeals, upon being presented with these new claims of error, will order the production of those portions of the transcript relating to these claims.\n\n\n17\nWhere the appointed lawyer can find no nonfrivolous claim of error in the portion of the transcript relating to the claims raised in the defendant's pro se application but has no idea whether the remainder of the transcript will disclose any such claim, he cannot in good conscience allege any new claim of error to which additional portions of the transcript would be relevant. Nor can he, without being furnished with the remainder of the transcript, conclude in good conscience that the case presents no issue which is nonfrivolous.\n\n\n18\nCounsel in this case was presented with precisely this dilemma and sought resolution of it by asking the Court of Appeals either to order the production of the remainder of the transcript, or to terminate his responsibility in that court by denying leave to appeal in forma pauperis. The Court of Appeals granted neither request. Thus we now have before us for resolution the problem of the conscientious appointed counsel at this critical stage in the screening process.\n\n\n19\nThis case, therefore, although it arises in the context of a request for portions of a transcript, raises fundamental questions concerning the proper role of appointed counsel on appeal. If the function of appointed counsel is essentially to aid the court, as amicus curiae, in assessing the claims of errors made in the pro se petition and in determining whether they include a nonfrivolous issue, then the practice now prevailing is perfectly suited to its end. It is then entirely logical to give the appointed lawyer only those portions of the transcript relating to the pro se claims of error, and to permit him to withdraw from the case if those portions of the transcript reveal no nonfrivolous claims. However, if the proper function of the appointed lawyer is essentially the same as that of the retained lawyer\u2014to be an effective advocate in an adversary system\u2014then there can be no justification for limiting him to those portions of the transcript relating to the claims of error raised by his indigent and often illiterate  lient and for permitting\u2014indeed in effect requiring\u2014him to withdraw from the case without examining the remainder of the trial transcript. It cannot seriously be suggested that a retained and experienced appellate lawyer would limit himself to the portions of the transcript designated by his client or even by the trial attorney, especially where the Courts of Appeals may, and not infrequently do, reverse convictions for 'plain errors' not raised at trial.\n\n\n20\nThe proper function of appointed counsel on appeal has been described by this Court. '(R)epresentation in the role of an advocate is required.' Ellis v. United States, 356 U.S. 674, 675, 78 S.Ct. 974, 975, 2 L.Ed.2d 1060. It is not enough that the appointed counsel perform 'essentially the role of amici curiae.' Ibid. If this requirement is to be more than a hollow platitude, then appointed counsel must be provided with the tools of an advocate. As any effective appellate advocate will attest, the most basic and fundamental tool of his profession is the complete trial transcript, through which his trained fingers may leaf and his trained eyes may roam in search of an error, a lead to an error, or even a basis upon which to urge a change in an established and hitherto accepted principle of law.5 Anything short of a complete transcript is incompatible with effective appellate advocacy.\n\n\n21\nThe opinion of the Court agrees with this conclusion as it relates to 'one whose lawyer on appeal enters the case after the trial is ended.' Ante, at 280. I believe that it is equally applicable to one whose appointed lawyer on appeal was also his lawyer at trial. No responsible retained lawyer who represents a defendant at trial will rely exclusively on his memory (even as supplemented by trial notes) in composing a list of possible trial errors which delimit his appeal. Nor should this be required of an appointed lawyer. An appointed lawyer, whether or not he represented the defendant at trial, needs a complete trial transcript to discharge his full responsibility of preparing the memorandum supporting the application to proceed in forma pauperis.6\n\n\n22\nI believe further that the availability of a complete transcript should not be made to depend on the facts of each case. This Court has recently condemned 'the inevitable delay that surrounds a procedure in which the courts give piecemeal attention to the series of motions that indigents must make before a final adjudication of the merits of their cases is reached.' Coppedge v. United States, 369 U.S., at 450, 82 S.Ct., at 924, 8 L.Ed.2d 21. One of the prime reasons for this delay has been the 'separate considerations of motions * * * for the preparation of a transcript of the trial proceedings * * *.' Ibid. A case-by-case approach\u2014regardless of the governing standard\u2014must inevitably contribute to this delay. Experience in this area has shown the need for a clear and simple across-the-board rule that would obviate the necessity for further court considerations of transcript requests. This rule should be that any criminal defendant desiring to appeal who cannot afford a transcript7 must be given one to help his appointed lawyer prepare a memorandum establishing the existence of a nonfrivolous issue in support of the application for leave to appeal  n forma pauperis.\n\n\n23\nThe Government suggests that such a memorandum can be adequately prepared, even by a lawyer newly appointed on appeal, without more transcript than is presently provided. It would have the lawyer conduct an investigation, including interviews with the trial judge, the prosecuting attorney and the trial defense counsel, in an effort to reconstruct the events of the trial. At best, however, this is a poor substitute for a transcript in disclosing possible error. Moreover, a lawyer appointed to represent the interests of a defendant should not be required to delegate his responsibility of determining whether error occurred at trial to participants at that trial whose conduct may have formed the very basis for the errors. Finally, this interview requirement is unduly burdensome on the appointed lawyers who are required to serve without compensation. As the Attorney General's Committee on Poverty and the Administration of Criminal Justice recently observed: 'It is not far from the truth to say that the federal system seeks to avoid the expenses of supplying transcripts to all financially disadvantaged defendants desiring to appeal by shifting the burdens to lawyers required to serve without compensation or reimbursement of expenses.'8\n\n\n24\nI conclude, therefore, that the interests of equal justice and the viability of our adversary system9 are impaired when an indigent defendant's access to a trial transcript is not as complete as that of a paying defendant. This 'concept of 'equal justice' does not confuse equality of treatment with identity of treatment.'10 It does, however, require the Government to do 'all that can reasonably be required of it to eliminate those factors that inhibit the proper and effective assertion' of the defendant's claims.11\n\n\n25\nProviding a complete transcript to all defendants who cannot afford to purchase one will not create an undue financial burden on the Government. Statistics for the last three years for which figures are available indicate that almost 90% of the criminal trials in the District of Columbia lasted three days or less and that a 'transcript of a three-day trial will generally cost less than $200 to prepare * * *.'12 The Government informs us that its present practice in the District of Columbia is not to oppose the preparation of transcripts which cost $200 or less to prepare. It seems likely, therefore, that a system of free transcripts will, in the long run, be less expensive than the present system with its multiple proceedings and frequent delays.13 Moreover, the financial costs are relatively unimportant when compared with the unnecessary hardship to defendants, many of whom are incarcerated during their attempts to secure appellate review because of their inability to raise the necessary bail.14 I agree with Judge Learned Hand: 'If we are to keep our democracy, there must be one commandment: Thou shalt not ration justice.'15\n\n\n26\nFinally, the foregoing discussion leads me to the ultimate conclusion that the cause of equal justice is unduly hindered by the cumbersome obstacles to appeal which have been erected by the procedure for screening frivolous attempts to appeal in forma pauperis. I agree, therefore, with my Brothers STEWART and BRENNAN, in their concurring opinion in Coppedge, 369 U.S., at 458, 82 S.Ct., at 928, 8 L.Ed.2d 21, that 'each Court of Appeals might well consider whether its task could not be more expeditiously and responsibly performed by simply' eliminating the entire process for screening in forma pauperis appeals and by treating such appeals in the same manner as paid appeals are now treated.16 Since 'no a priori justification can be found for considering (in forma pauperis appeals), as a class, to be more frivolous than those in which costs have been paid,' Id., 369 U.S. at 449, 82 S.Ct. at 923, 8 L.Ed.2d 21, it would seem to follow that no justification exists for erecting artificial barriers to appeal for indigent defendants, '(p)articularly since (these) litigants * * * may, in the trial court, have suffered disadvantages in the defense of their cases inherent in their impecunious condition * * *.' Id., 369 U.S. at 450, 82 S.Ct. at 923, 8 L.Ed.2d 21.17 However, as long as the Courts of Appeals continue to require a preliminary showing before granting an indigent leave to appeal, we can do no less than require, under our supervisory power, that a full transcript be made available, without limitation, to the lawyer appointed to help make that showing.\n\n\n27\nMr. Justice CLARK, concurring in the result.\n\n\n28\nA half dozen years ago, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 clearly directed that no indigent appeal may be taken 'if the trial court certifies in writing that it is not taken in good faith.' The words of the statute are identical today but the Court's interpretations have stripped them of the apparent congressional meaning. In Johnson v. United States, 352 U.S. 565, 77 S.Ct. 550, 1 L.Ed.2d 593 (1957), we said that counsel must be appointed to represent an indigent who wishes to contest the validity of a certificate under \u00a7 1915 and that such counsel must be 'enabled to show that the grounds for seeking an appeal from the judgment of conviction are not frivolous and do not justify the finding that the appeal is not sought in good faith.' At 566 of 352 U.S., at 551 of 77 S.Ct., 1 L.Ed.2d 593. In Farley v. United States, 354 U.S. 521, 77 S.Ct. 1371, 1 L.Ed.2d 1529 (1957), counsel for the indigent claimed that the evidence was insufficient to justify the conviction, and this Court required a transcript to be furnished on that point. A year later in Ellis v. United States, 356 U.S. 674, 78 S.Ct. 974, 2 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1958), it appeare  that counsel appointed by the Court of Appeals 'performed essentially the role of amici curiae,' 356 U.S. at 675, 78 S.Ct. at 975, 2 L.Ed.2d 1060, and the Court held that 'representation in the role of an advocate is required,' ibid., vacating the judgment on the concession of the Solicitor General that the question of probable cause raised by petitioner could not necessarily be called frivolous. In 1962 in Coppedge v. United States, 369 U.S. 438, 82 S.Ct. 917, 8 L.Ed.2d 21, the Court held:\n\n\n29\n'It is not the burden of the petitioner to show that his      appeal has merit, in the sense that he is bound, or even      likely, to prevail ultimately. He is to be heard, as is any      appellant in a criminal case, if he makes a rational argument      on the law or facts. It is the burden of the Government, in      opposing an attempted criminal appeal in forma pauperis, to      show that the appeal is lacking in merit, indeed, that it is      so lacking in merit that the court would dismiss the case on      motion of the Government, had the case been docketed and a      record been filed by an appellant able to afford the expense      of complying with those requirements.' At 448 of 369 U.S., at      922 of 82 S.Ct., 8 L.Ed.2d 21.\n\n\n30\nToday we are faced with the question whether counsel, appointed on an appeal to represent an indigent, but not present at the trial of the case in the District Court, is entitled to a full transcript so as to enable him to determine whether plain error or defects affecting substantial rights occurred during the trial. As I see the problem, the Government has not met the burden placed upon it by the above language in Coppedge, namely to sustain the frivolity of the appeal, insofar as plain error is concerned. I appears to me that the Government must furnish the full transcript in order to enable petitioner's new counsel to determine whether plain error occurred during the trial, and likewise to enable the Court of Appeals to pass upon the point.\n\n\n31\nWhile I dissented in Coppedge as well as Farley, I feel bound by their holdings and therefore concur in the result here. In so doing, I trust that when Congress adopts the Criminal Justice Act or similar legislation* which provides compensation for counsel representing indigents, the same counsel who tried the case in the District Court will be appointed in the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n32\nMr. Justice HARLAN, dissenting.\n\n\n33\nI think the Court should not, in the name of exercising its supervisory powers, engraft this further requirement on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915.1 The holding is that an indigent convict who\u2014following the trial court's certification that his appeal was frivolous and not taken in good faith\u2014has received at the direction of the Court of Appeals a free copy of that portion of the trial transcript germane to the errors asserted as grounds for appeal, is entitled as of right to a free copy of the balance of the transcript if his appellate counsel was not the lawyer who represented him at the trial. The theory is that this is necessary to enable the new lawyer to discover possible 'plain error.'\n\n\n34\nFour members of the Court would go further. They would furnish comp ete transcripts as a matter of course to all indigent appellants, whether or not represented at the appellate stage by the same lawyer who acted for them at the trial. Ante, p. 288. And recognizing that any indigent receiving such a transcript is thus advantaged over an appellant who has to pay for his transcript, they go on to suggest that fairness may require that appellants who are not indigent, but impoverished, should be furnished free transcripts to the extent that they cannot afford to pay for them. Ante, p. 289, n. 7. Although the majority opinion stops short of both of these propositions, given what is now done can it be said that these more expansive positions are without force? Be that as it may, the Court has taken a long step in derogation of the hitherto consistently maintained view, both in federal and state criminal cases, that an indigent defendant is not automatically entitled to a free transcript simply because those economically better situated can obtain their transcripts at will. See Johnson v. United States, 352 U.S. 565, 566, 77 S.Ct. 550, 551, 1 L.Ed.2d 593; Griffin v. People of State of Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 20, 76 S.Ct. 585, 591, 100 L.Ed. 891; Eskridge v. Washington State Board of Prison Terms & Paroles, 357 U.S. 214, 216, 78 S.Ct. 1061, 1062, 2 L.Ed.2d 1269; Draper v. Washington, 372 U.S. 487, 495, 83 S.Ct. 774, 778\u2014779, 9 L.Ed.2d 899.\n\n\n35\nGranting that \u00a7 1915 has not caught up with this Court's recent pronouncements in this area (see concurring opinion of CLARK, J., ante, pp. 296\u2014298) and that, as recommended in the recent report of the Attorney General's Committee,2 the time has come for a comprehensive overhauling of the procedures governing in forma pauperis appeals in the federal system, I believe that such an undertaking is more appropriately to be accomplished by congressional action, taken in collaboration with the Judicial Conference of the United States, than by piecemeal adjudications of this Court. Especially meet for such a course is the innovation made today, a step which in countrywide application affects the public treasury to an unknown degree, and whose wisdom should not be judged in the abstract or upon the limited data presently before the Court.\n\n\n36\nA balanced solution of a problem having such unforeseeable ramifications requires consideration of the informed views of those on the firing line of the administration of criminal justice District judges, Circuit judges, United States attorneys, defense lawyers and Legal Aid Societies\u2014and exploration of differing conditions among the Circuits. It might be concluded that a nationwide requirement of this sort would be unsound, and that the matter is best left for discrete treatment by the Judicial Councils in the various Circuits, subject of course to constitutional limitations. Remotely situated as this Court is from the day-to-day workings of the criminal system, it should hesitate to promulgate blanket requirements on this subject based largely upon theoretical considerations. Cf. Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 23, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 1081, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (dissenting opinion of this writer).\n\n\n37\nI would dispose of this case as the Government suggests by remanding it to the Court of Appeals for further consideration in light of that court's subsequent decision in Ingram v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 283, 315 F.2d 29. I do not understand this Court's decision to rest on constitutional grounds, nor do I think it well could.\n\n\n\n1\n During oral argument of this case, counsel for respondent stated that the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia initiated, since this case was before the lower courts, a practice of not filing an opposition to a motion for a full transcript where the cost of such a transcript will not exceed $200. This is usually the case when the trial does not exceed three days. This practice is followed because the United States Attorney feels that the time and effort necessary to oppose such a motion will, in terms of dollars, exceed $200. According to counsel, the Federal District Court, pursuant to a 'tacit' understanding, usually grants unopposed motions for a complete transcript.\n\n\n2\n In Ingram the Court of Appeals said:\n'* * * when a pro se petition is filed, upon direct appeal from judgment of conviction, and the claims of error stated therein (e.g., 'insufficiency of evidence,' 'unlawful search and seizure,') are so conclusory in nature that 'their substance cannot adequately be ascertained,' counsel will be appointed and, simultaneously, the portion of the transcript of proceedings which relates to the conclusory allegations will be ordered so that appointed counsel may determine their merit. Of course, counsel will not be limited to the transcript initially allowed if he can in good conscience advance other claims of error requiring additional portions of the transcript.' Id., 315 F.2d at 30\u201431.\n\n\n3\n Boskey, The Right to Counsel in Appellate Proceedings, 45 Minn.L.Rev. 783, 792\u2014793 (1961), in speaking of the task of counsel who is appointed to represent the appellant and who did not serve as trial counsel, says:\n'* * * the new counsel is operating under serious handicaps. Normally he has no prior acquaintance with the trial proceedings and no personal knowledge of the case which would form a basis for sound judgment. Normally no transcript is in existence at this stage, so he cannot make his own independent analysis of the trial proceedings.\n'In order to investigate whether the appeal involves one or more 'not plainly frivolous' issues, counsel may examine the formal documents on record in the trial court; he may interview his client; he may discuss the case with defendant's trial counsel and with the prosecutor; he may try to work out with the prosecutor an 'agreed statement' of the case, despite the fact that he lacks the information necessary to assure himself that the agreed statement would be an accurate one; he may ask the official court reporter as a courtesy to read back certain limited portions of the reporter's shorthand notes\n(or all of them, if the trial was a short one); and it has been suggested\u2014though perhaps without too much regard for the practicalities of some situations\u2014that he may even interview the trial judge and seek to inspect any notes which the trial judge kept of the trial proceedings. Such efforts are apt to be incredibly time-consuming and frustrating, and sometimes may arouse in counsel a feeling that he would be well advised to avoid future assignments of appellate in forma pauperis work. But worse than that, in many instances these efforts will be wholly unsatisfactory as a means of safeguarding the defendant's rights.\n'Recollections and notes of trial counsel and of others are apt to be faulty and incomplete. Frequently, issues simply cannot even be seen\u2014let alone assessed\u2014without reading an accurate transcript. Particularly is this true of questions relating to evidence or to the judge's charge; and it may also apply to many other types of questions. Moreover, the actual record (if appellate counsel could have it to inspect) might disclose issues substantial enough to constitute probable or possible 'plain error,' even though trial counsel was not aware of their existence; and the indigent should have the same opportunity as the wealthy to urge that plain error should be noticed on appeal. In short, a conscientious counsel freshly entering the case at the appellate stage normally is likely to conclude that a full or partial transcript of the trial proceedings will be indispensable if the requisite 'dependable record' is to be obtained as a basis for evaluating the case.'\n\n\n1\n Rule 39(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that:\n'Unless good cause is shown for an earlier hearing, the appellate court shall set the appeal for argument on a date not less than 30 days after the filing in that court of the record on appeal and as soon after the expiration of that period as the state of the calendar will permit. Preference shall be given to appeals in criminal cases over appeals in civil cases.'\n\n\n2\n See Pannell v. United States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 379, 320 F.2d 698; Committee on the Administration of Bail of the Junior Bar Section of the Bar Association of the District of Columbia, Report on the Bail System of the District of Columbia (1963).\n\n\n3\n Permitting the trial lawyer to withdraw at that stage probably reflects a recognition both of the burden of serving as uncompensated trial counsel and of the different skills often possessed by trial and\nappellate lawyers. By noting the existence of a hiatus in representation at such a critical period, I do not intend to signify approval.\nThe Attorney General's Committee on Poverty and the Administration of Federal Criminal Justice described this phase of the process as follows: '(T)he convicted defendant must file a notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of the judgment, if the right to appeal is to be preserved. Since an assigned counsel under present practices often does not conceive it to be part of his obligations to advise the defendant of his right to appeal or to assist in perfecting that right, and since many district courts do not routinely advise the defendant of his appeal rights, some financially disadvantaged defendants, because of their ignorance of the jurisdictional requirements, irrevocably lose their rights to appeal. The defendant who is unable to pay the costs of a trial transcript or to pay court costs is required to apply for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. The application, which is in affidavit form, contains allegations of financial incapacity and the reasons relied on by defendant to obtain redress in the appellate courts. Because normally no provision is made for counsel at this stage of the proceedings, the application is often inexpertly prepared and conceived, frequently resulting in injury to the defendant's interests and to the sound administration of justice.' Attorney General's Committee on Poverty and the Administration of Federal Criminal Justice, Report on Poverty and the Administration of Federal Criminal Justice (1963), 100 (hereinafter cited as Attorney General's Report).\n\n\n4\n In the District of Columbia, many lawyers chose this course and, at least until recently, leave to withdraw was freely granted.\n\n\n5\n See, e.g., Tatum v. United States, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 386, 190 F.2d 612; Durham v. United States, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 228, 214 F.2d 862, 45 A.L.R.2d 1430; United States v. Currens, 3 Cir., 290 F.2d 751; McDonald v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 120, 312 F.2d 847; Miller v. United States, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 45, 320 F.2d 767.\n\n\n6\n Under the practice now prevailing, problems relating to transcripts may arise both before and after leave to appeal in forma pauperis is granted. If counsel were provided with a complete transcript upon being appointed to prepare the memorandum in support of the application to appeal in forma pauperis, the problem of supplying additional portions of the transcript after leave is granted would become moot.\n\n\n7\n Indigence 'must be conceived as a relative concept. An improverished accused is not necessarily one totally devoid of means.' Attorney General's Report, at 8. An accused must be deemed indigent when 'at any stage of the proceedings (his) lack of means . . . substantially inhibits or prevents the proper assertion of a (particular) right or a claim of right.' Ibid. Indigence must be defined with reference to the particular right asserted. Thus, the fact that a defendant may be able to muster enough resources, of his own or of a friend or relative, to obtain bail does not in itself establish his nonindigence for the purpose of purchasing a complete trial transcript or retaining a lawyer.\n\n\n8\n Attorney General's Report, at 102.\n\n\n9\n Id., at 10\u201411: 'The essence of the adversary system is challenge. The survival of our system of criminal justice and the values which it advances depends upon a constant, searching, and creative questioning of official decisions and assertions of authority at all stages of the process. The proper performance of the defense function is thus as vital to the health of the system as the performance of the prosecuting and adjudicatory functions. It follows that insofar as the financial status of the accused impedes vigorous and proper challenges, it constitutes a threat to the viability of the adversary system. We believe that the system is imperiled by the large numbers of accused persons unable to employ counsel or to meet even modest bail requirements and by the large, but indeterminate, numbers of persons, able to pay some part of the costs of defense, but unable to finance a full and proper defense. Persons suffering such disabilities are incapable of providing the challenges that are indispensable to satisfactory operation of the system. The loss to the interests of accused individuals, occasioned by these failures, (is) great and apparent. It is also clear that a situation in which persons are required to contest a serious accusation but are denied access to the tools of contest is offensive to fairness and equity. Beyond these considerations, however, is the fact that the conditions produced by the financial incapacity of the accused are detrimental to the proper function ng of the system of justice and that the loss in vitality of the adversary system, thereby occasioned, significantly endangers the basic interests of a free community.'\n\n\n10\n Id., at 9.\n\n\n11\n Ibid.\n\n\n12\n Special Committee of the Junior Bar Section of the Bar Association of the District of Columbia, Report to the Attorney General's Committee on Poverty and the Administration of Federal Criminal Justice, reprinted in Brief of the Bar Association of the District of Columbia, as amicus curiae, at A\u20149, A\u201416.\n\n\n13\n The Attorney General's Committee on Poverty and the Administration of Federal Criminal Justice made the following observation concerning the real cost of the present system: 'The Committee believes that proper evaluation of comparative costs requires that attention be directed to the 'hidden costs' of the present system. First there are the costs in judicial time in the district courts and courts of appeals, just noted, that result from the administration of the present system. Second are the costs in the time of public officials required to be interviewed by assigned counsel in his effort to establish a record or to justify the ordering of a transcript in proceedings involving leave to appeal in forma pauperis. Third are the costs of time, effort, and expense of assigned counsel. The present system is able to function at all only by shifting a large part of the burdens of the system on lawyers who are required to serve without compensation or reimbursement. It should be carefully noted that in a system of adequate representation involving the use of compensated counsel the shifting of many of these burdens to counsel will no longer be possible. In many cases the provision of a transcript at the outset of the appellate process will involve substantially less expense to the government than the payment of attorneys' fees for time spent by counsel in an effort to settle a record for disposition of the application to appeal in forma pauperis and in other proceedings made necessary by the present system. Fourth, a system that obstructs access to direct review is likely to encourage resort by prisoners to collateral attack on their convictions and sentences with losses of time and money thereby occasioned. Such has been the uniform experience of state systems of criminal justice.' Attorney General's Report, at 114.\nThe Bar Association of the District of Columbia, in their brief amicus curiae, state that 'On the basis of (their) experience as appointed counsel, (they) believe strongly that providing a trial transcript in every case will significantly reduce the number of collateral attack proceedings under 28 U.S.C. 2255, habeas corpus, or coram nobis.' The Attorney General's Report also points out 'the fact that the free accessibility and quality of appellate review has reduced collateral attacks on sentences imposed by court martial (where the 'record is supplied the defendant at government expense') to an absolute minimum.' Attorney General's Report, at 109. Thus, the automatic provision of free transcripts to all federal criminal defendants who cannot afford to purchase them would seem to be entirely consistent with the spirit of our recent decision in Bartone v. United States, 375 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 21, 11 L.Ed.2d 11, where the Court observed that 'It is more appropriate, whenever possible, to correct errors reachable by the appeal rather than remit the parties to a new collateral proceeding.'

See note 13, supra.\n\n\n16\n 'The Government would then be free in any case to file before argument a motion to dismiss the appeal as frivolous, as every appellee is always free to do.' Coppedge v.

Every justification of the present practices which has come to the Committee's attention is predicated on the assumption that the screening procedures are required to prevent an inundation of frivolous appeals and that the increases in the number of appeals will result in large monetary costs to the government and in substantial burdens on adjudication in the courts of appeals. We believe that even if these fears were substantial, such considerations are not entitled to be given decisive weight by a system of criminal justice dedicated to the objective of full and equal justice to all accused persons and to the proper and vigorous operation of the adversary system. The Committee notes, however, that many American states\u2014some sufficiently populous to provide reasonable comparisons with the federal system of justice have granted financially disadvantaged defendants full access to appellate review without experiencing burdens approaching the magnitude of those sometimes predicted as the consequence of similar measures in the federal courts. We believe, also, that forecasts of inordinate burdens do not take adequate account of the fact that the proliferation of motions and petitions produced by present practice is highly expensive of judicial time.'\n\n\n*\n S. 1057, the proposed Criminal Justice Act, was passed by the Senate August 6, 1963. The Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives and the Rules Committee reported favorably a compromise bill, H.R. 7457, and on December 10, 1963, the House voted to take up the legislation on the floor.\n\n\n1\n '\u00a7 1915.

{"text":"444 U.S. 277\n100 S.Ct. 553\n62 L.Ed.2d 481\nGeorge MARTINEZ et al., Appellants,v.STATE OF CALIFORNIA et al.\nNo. 78-1268.\nArgued Nov. 5, 1979.\nDecided Jan. 15, 1980.\nRehearing Denied March 3, 1980.\n\nSee 445 U.S. 920, 100 S.Ct. 1285.\nSyllabus\nAppellants' decedent, a 15-year-old girl, was murdered by a parolee five months after he was released from prison despite his history as a sex offender.  Appellants brought an action in a California court under state law and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming that appellee state officials, by their action in releasing the parolee, subjected the decedent to a deprivation of her life without due process of law and were therefore liable in damages for the harm caused by the parolee.  The trial court sustained a demurrer to the complaint.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that a California statute granting public employees absolute immunity from liability for any injury resulting from parole-release determinations provided appellees with a complete defense to appellants' state-law claims, and that appellees enjoyed quasi-judicial immunity from liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\nHeld :\n1. The California immunity statute is not unconstitutional when applied to defeat a tort claim arising under state law.  Pp. 280-283.\n(a) The statute, which merely provides a defense to potential state tort-law liability, did not deprive appellants' decedent of her life without due process of law because it condoned a parole decision that led indirectly to her death.  A legislative decision that has an incremental impact on the probability that death will result in any given situation cannot be characterized as state action depriving a person of life just because it may set in motion a chain of events that ultimately leads to the random death of an innocent bystander.  P. 281.\n(b) Even if the statute can be characterized as a deprivation of property, the State's interest in fashioning its own rules of tort law is paramount to any discernible federal interest, except perhaps an interest in protecting the individual citizen from wholly arbitrary or irrational state action.  The statute is not irrational because the California Legislature could reasonably conclude that judicial review of parole decisions \"would inevitably inhibit the exercise of discretion\" and that this inhibiting effect could impair the State's ability to implement a parole program designed to promote rehabilitation of inmates as well as security within prisons by holding out a promise of potential rewards.  Pp. 281-283.\n2. Appellants did not allege a claim for relief under federal law.  Pp. 283-285.\n(a) The Fourteenth Amendment protected appellants' decedent only from deprivation by the State of life without due process of law, and although the decision to release the parolee from prison was action by the State, the parolee's action five months later cannot be fairly characterized as state action.  Pp. 284-285.\n(b) Regardless of whether, as a matter of state tort law, the parole board either had a \"duty\" to avoid harm to the parolee's victim or proximately caused her death, appellees did not \"deprive\" appellants' decedent of life within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.  P. 285.\n(c) Under the particular circumstances where the parolee was in no sense an agent of the parole board, and the board was not aware that appellants' decedent, as distinguished from the public at large, faced any special danger, appellants' decedent's death was too remote a consequence of appellees' action to hold them responsible under \u00a7 1983.  P. 285.\n85 Cal.App.3d 430, 149 Cal.Rptr. 519, affirmed.\nDonald McGrath, II, San Diego, Cal., for appellants.\nJeffrey T. Miller, San Diego, Cal., for appellees.\nMr. Justice STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe two federal questions that appellants ask us to decide are (1) whether the Fourteenth Amendment invalidates a California statute granting absolute immunity to public employees who make parole-release determinations, and (2) whether such officials are absolutely immune from liability in an action brought under the federal Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.1  We agree with the California Court of Appeal that the state statute is valid when applied to claims arising under state law, and we conclude that appellants have not alleged a claim for relief under federal law.\n\n\n2\nThe case arises out of the murder of a 15-year-old girl by a parolee.  Her survivors brought this action in a California court claiming that the state officials responsible for the parole-release decision are liable in damages for the harm caused by the parolee.\n\n\n3\nThe complaint alleged that the parolee, one Thomas, was convicted of attempted rape in December 1969.  He was first committed to a state mental hospital as a \"Mentally Disordered Sex Offender not amenable to treatment\" and thereafter sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 1 to 20 years, with a recommendation that he not be paroled.  Nevertheless, five years later, appellees decided to parole Thomas to the care of his mother.  They were fully informed about his history, his propensities, and the likelihood that he would commit another violent crime.  Moreover, in making their release determination they failed to observe certain \"requisite formalities.\"  Five months after his release Thomas tortured and killed appellants' decedent.  We assume, as the complaint alleges, that appellees knew, or should have known, that the release of Thomas created a clear and present danger that such an incident would occur.  Their action is characterized not only as negligent, but also as reckless, willful, wanton and malicious.2 Appellants prayed for actual and punitive damages of $2 million.\n\n\n4\nThe trial judge sustained a demurrer to the complaint and his order was upheld on appeal.  85 Cal.App.3d 430, 149 Cal.Rptr. 519 (1978).  After the California Supreme Court denied appellants' petition for a hearing, we noted probable jurisdiction.  441 U.S. 960, 99 S.Ct. 2403, 60 L.Ed.2d 1064.\n\n\n5\n* Section 845.8(a) of the Cal. Gov't Code Ann. (West Supp. (1979)) provides:\n\n\n6\n\"Neither a public entity nor a public employee is liable      for:\n\n\n7\n(a) Any injury resulting from determining whether to      parole or release a prisoner or from determining the terms      and conditions of his parole or release or from determining      whether to revoke his parole or release.\"\n\n\n8\nThe California courts held that this statute provided appellees with a complete defense to appellants' state-law claims.3  They considered and rejected the contention that the immunity statute as so construed violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.4\n\n\n9\nLike the California courts, we cannot accept the contention that this statute deprived Thomas' victim of her life without due process of law because it condoned a parole decision that led indirectly to her death.  The statute neither authorized nor immunized the deliberate killing of any human being.  It is not the equivalent of a death penalty statute which expressly authorizes state agents to take a person's life after prescribed procedures have been observed.  This statute merely provides a defense to potential state tort-law liability.  At most, the availability of such a defense may have encouraged members of the parole board to take somewhat greater risks of recidivism in exercising their authority to release prisoners than they otherwise might.  But the basic risk that repeat offenses may occur is always present in any parole system.  A legislative decision that has an incremental impact on the probability that death will result in any given situation\u2014such as setting the speed limit at 55-miles-per-hour instead of 45\u2014cannot be characterized as state action depriving a person of life just because it may set in motion a chain of events that ultimately leads to the random death of an innocent bystander.\n\n\n10\nNor can the statute be characterized as an invalid deprivation of property.  Arguably, the cause of action for wrongful death that the State has created is a species of \"property\" protected by the Due Process Clause.  On that hypothesis, the immunity statute could be viewed as depriving the plaintiffs of that property interest insofar as they seek to assert a claim against parole officials.5  But even if one characterizes the immunity defense as a statutory deprivation, it would remain true that the State's interest in fashioning its own rules of tort law is paramount to any discernible federal interest, except perhaps an interest in protecting the individual citizen from state action that is wholly arbitrary or irrational.\n\n\n11\nWe have no difficulty in accepting California's conclusion that there \"is a rational relationship between the state's purposes and the statute.\"6  In fashioning state policy in a \"practical and troublesome area\" like this, see McGinnis v. Royster, 410 U.S. 263, 270, 93 S.Ct. 1055, 1059, 35 L.Ed.2d 282, the California Legislature could reasonably conclude that judicial review of a parole officer's decisions \"would inevitably inhibit the exercise of discretion,\" United States ex rel. Miller v. Twomey, 479 F.2d 701, 721 (CA7 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1146, 94 S.Ct. 900, 39 L.Ed.2d 102.  That inhibiting effect could impair the State's ability to implement a parole program designed to promote rehabilitation of inmates as well as security within prison walls by holding out a promise of potential rewards. Whether one agrees or disagrees with California's decision to provide absolute immunity for parole officials in a case of this kind, one cannot deny that it rationally furthers a policy that reasonable lawmakers may favor.  As federal judges, we have no authority to pass judgment on the wisdom of the underlying policy determination.  We therefore find no merit in the contention that the State's immunity statute is unconstitutional when applied to defeat a tort claim arising under state law.\n\nII\n\n12\nWe turn then to appellants' \u00a7 1983 claim that appellees, by their action in releasing Thomas, subjected appellants' decedent to a deprivation of her life without due process of law.7 It is clear that the California immunity statute does not control this claim even though the federal cause of action is being asserted in the state courts.8  We also conclude that it is not necessary for us to decide any question concerning the immunity of state parole officials as a matter of federal law because, as we recently held in Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 61 L.Ed.2d 433, \"[t]he first inquiry in any \u00a7 1983 suit  . . .  is whether the plaintiff has been deprived of a right 'secured by the Constitution and laws' \" of the United States.9  The answer to that inquiry disposes of this case.\n\n\n13\nAppellants contend that the decedent's right to life is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.  But the Fourteenth Amendment protected her only from deprivation by the \"State  . . .  of life  . . .  without due process of law.\" Although the decision to release Thomas from prison was action by the State, the action of Thomas five months later cannot be fairly characterized as state action.  Regardless of whether, as a matter of state tort law, the parole board could be said either to have had a \"duty\" to avoid harm to his victim or to have proximately caused her death, see Grimm v. Arizona Bd. of Pardons and Paroles, 115 Ariz. 260, 564 P.2d 1227 (1977); Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339, 162 N.E. 99 (1928), we hold that, taking these particular allegations as true, appellees did not \"deprive\" appellants' decedent of life within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n14\nHer life was taken by the parolee five months after his release.10  He was in no sense an agent of the parole board.  Cf. Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90. Further, the parole board was not aware that appellants' decedent, as distinguished from the public at large, faced any special danger.  We need not and do not decide that a parole officer could never be deemed to \"deprive\" someone of life by action taken in connection with the release of a prisoner on parole.11  But we do hold that at least under the particular circumstances of this parole decision, appellants' decedent's death is too remote a consequence of the parole officers' action to hold them responsible under the federal civil rights law.  Although a \u00a7 1983 claim has been described as \"a species of tort liability,\" Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 417, 96 S.Ct. 984, 988, 47 L.Ed.2d 128, it is perfectly clear that not every injury in which a state official has played some part is actionable under that statute.\n\n\n15\nThe judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n16\n\nSo ordered.\n\n\n\n\n1\n \"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\"\n\n\n2\n Although the complaint refers to the failure to supervise Thomas after his release, a failure to warn females in the area of potential danger, and a failure to revoke the original parole decision, the litigation has focused entirely on the original decision.  The individual appellees are not alleged to have responsibility for postrelease supervision of Thomas.\n\n\n3\n The dismissal of appellants' cause of action charging negligent failure to warn females in the area of danger was predicated on appellants' concession that there was no \"continuing relationship between the state and the victim,\" 85 Cal.App.3d 430, 435, 149 Cal.Rptr. 519, 523 (1978), a requirement of state law.\n\n\n4\n \". . .  No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;  nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law;  nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S.Const., Amdt. 14, \u00a7 1.\nAlthough the question presented in the jurisdictional statement posits an Equal Protection Clause challenge to the statute, that point was not actually briefed in this Court.  It was also neither raised in nor treated by the courts below.  We therefore make no further reference to that challenge.\n\n\n5\n It is arguable, however, that the immunity defense, like an element of the tort claim itself, is merely one aspect of the State's definition of that property interest.  Recently, in considering a lawyer's claim of immunity in a state malpractice action, we noted that\n\"when state law creates a cause of action, the State is free to define the defenses to that claim, including the defense of immunity, unless, of course, the state rule is in conflict with federal law.\"  Ferri v. Ackerman, 444 U.S. 193, 198, 100 S.Ct. 402, 406, 62 L.Ed.2d 355.\n\n\n6\n \"Martinez says the statute, Government Code section 845.8, subdivision (a), is unconstitutional because it permits the deprivation of life, a fundamental right, without due process.  He suggests the statute, if it confers absolute immunity, encouraged the actions resulting in Mary Ellen's death and, thus, requires a compelling state interest.  However, the Legislature has broad powers to control governmental tort liability limited only by the rule it not act arbitrarily (Reed v. City & County of San Francisco, 237 Cal.App.2d 23, 24, 46 Cal.Rptr. 543).  The California Tort Claims Act as a whole (Gov.Code \u00a7 810 et seq.) has been found constitutional (Datil v. City of Los Angeles, 263 Cal.App.2d 655, 660-661, 69 Cal.Rptr. 788).  The stated purpose of section 845.8, subdivision (a), is to allow correctional personnel to make determinations of release or parole unfettered by any fear of tort liability (Law Revision Com. com.).  To impose tort liability would have a chilling effect on the decision-making process, impede implementation of trial release programs and prolong incarceration unjustifiably for many prisoners.  There is a rational relationship between the state's purposes and the statute.\"  85 Cal.App.3d, at 437, 149 Cal.Rptr., at 524.\nThe opinion of the California Court of Appeal does not expressly mention the Federal Constitution.  But it is clear from appellants' response to the demurrer that they were relying on \"a federally protected right to life under the Constitution of the United States.\"  Record 59.\n\n\n7\n We note that the California courts accepted jurisdiction of this federal claim.  That exercise of jurisdiction appears to be consistent with the general rule that where\n\" 'an act of Congress gives a penalty to a party aggrieved, without specifying a remedy for its enforcement, there is no reason why it should not be enforced, if not provided otherwise by some act of Congress, by a proper action in a state court.' \" Testa v. Katt, 330 U.S. 386, 391, 67 S.Ct. 810, 813, 91 L.Ed. 967, quoting Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U.S. 130, 137, 23 L.Ed. 833.\nSee also Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U.S. 1, 36, n. 17, 96 S.Ct. 2413, 2430, n. 17, 49 L.Ed.2d 276 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting); Grubb v. Public Utilities Comm'n, 281 U.S. 470, 476, 50 S.Ct. 374, 377, 74 L.Ed. 972.  We have never considered, however, the question whether a State must entertain a claim under \u00a7 1983.  We note that where the same type of claim, if arising under state law, would be enforced in the state courts, the state courts are generally not free to refuse enforcement of the federal claim. Testa v. Katt, 330 U.S., at 394, 67 S.Ct., at 814.  But see Chamberlain v. Brown, 223 Tenn. 25, 442 S.W.2d 248 (1969).\n\n\n8\n \"Conduct by persons acting under color of state law which is wrongful under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or \u00a7 1985(3) cannot be immunized by state law.  A construction of the federal statute which permitted a state immunity defense to have controlling effect would transmute a basic guarantee into an illusory promise; and the supremacy clause of the Constitution insures that the proper construction may be enforced.  See McLaughlin v. Tilendis, 398 F.2d 287, 290 (7th Cir. 1968).  The immunity claim raises a question of federal law.\"  Hampton v. Chicago, 484 F.2d 602, 607 (CA7 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 917, 94 S.Ct. 1413, 39 L.Ed.2d 471.\n\n\n9\n Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S., at 140, 99 S.Ct., at 2692. Although there was a dissent in that case, the issue that divided the Court was, assuming the plaintiff had been deprived of constitutionally protected liberty, what process was due.  There was no disagreement with the majority's methodology of isolating the particular constitutional infringement complained of.  Since we decide here that the State did not \"deprive\" appellants' decedent of a constitutionally protected right, we need not reach the question whether a lack of \"due process\" was adequately alleged by the reference to a failure to observe \"requisite formalities.\"  It must be remembered that even if a state decision does deprive an individual of life or property, and even if that decision is erroneous, it does not necessarily follow that the decision violated that individual's right to due process.\n\n\n10\n Compare the facts in Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495, where local law enforcement officials themselves beat a citizen to death.\n\n\n11\n We reserve the question of what immunity, if any, a state parole officer has in a \u00a7 1983 action where a constitutional violation is made out by the allegations.\n\n\n","label":1}

Dibrell, Jr., Coleman, Tex., for respondent.\nMr. Chief Justice BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nWe granted certiorari to decide whether in a state civil proceeding a lawyer may be cited for contempt for advising his client, a party to the litigation, that the client may refuse on Fifth Amendment grounds to produce subpoenaed material.\n\n\n2\n* Petitioner is a lawyer. In January 1973 his client was convicted before a Municipal Court in the city of Temple, Texas, of selling seven obscene magazines in violation of a Temple ordinance. Six days later the client, Michael McKelva, was served by a Bell County deputy sheriff with a subpoena duces tecum directing him to produce 52 magazines before the 169th Judicial District Court. The titles of the magazines were given but no other description was contained in the warrant.\n\n\n3\nUnder the Texas Penal Code1 upon application by any city attorney the district courts may issue injunctions to prevent illegal distribution of obscene matter. The subpoena here was requested by the Temple City Attorney in order to obtain such an injunction. Besides commanding production of the magazines it ordered petitioner's client to appear at a hearing on February 1, 1973, and give testimony.\n\n\n4\nMcKelva appeared represented by petitioner and an associate, Karl A. Maley. Earlier, Maley had filed a written motion to quash the subpoena. The motion claimed, inter alia, that the issuance of the subpoena was merely an attempt to require materials and testimony in violation of McKelva's constitutional right not to incriminate himself.\n\n\n5\nAt the hearing petitioner orally argued the motion to quash. He, too, contended that the city was attempting, through a civil proceeding, to discover evidence which properly should be discovered, if at all, through criminal process. He freely admitted that the magazines dealt explicitly with acts of a sexual nature, and that they were 'of the same character' as the magazines for distribution of which McKelva previously had been convicted.2 Thus, he argued, it was quite clear that a 'substantial possibility of self-incrimination' existed if McKelva was required to produce the magazines. Petitioner foresaw possible criminal prosecution either under the Temple ordinance3 again, or under Art. 527 itself.\n\n\n6\nAlthough petitioner claimed the Fifth Amendment's protection was available in any proceeding whether civil or criminal, he also urged that under the circumstances the injunctive proceeding for which the magazines were subpoenaed was quasi-criminal in nature. He noted that it was brought under the Penal Code of Texas and concluded that the city should secure a search warrant, describing with particularity the magazines it desired produced.\n\n\n7\nThe City Attorney responded that the proceeding was purely civil and that 'there is no contention on the part of the City or any attempt on the part of the City to get any evidence for any criminal prosecution,' and thus any material produced would not be incriminating. Further, he maintained, because there 'are no criminal sanctions . . . there will be no evidence that would be incriminating under the rules . . ..'\n\n\n8\nIn reply petitioner drew an analogy to tax cases where, he argued, courts have prohibited the Internal Revenue Service from using subpoenas to discover records which might tend to incriminate taxpayers. Petitioner contended that the nature of the proceeding in which evidence is sought is irrelevant to the compass of the Fifth Amendment, and that the character of the material requested is the only relevant inquiry. He asserted that the sole test is whether production of the material would create a substantial probability of criminal prosecution for his client. He noted that the City Attorney's representation that the city is not interested in a criminal prosecution 'certainly does not bind for example the County Attorney, or anyone else . . . who might be interested in prosecuting such a case.'\n\n\n9\nThe court then denied the motion to quash and petitioner's client, McKelva, took the stand. In answer to preliminary questions he gave his name and address and stated that he was the operator of Mike's News in Temple. He admitted to having been served with the subpoena, but when he was asked whether he had brought the magazines he replied: '(U)nder the advice of Counsel, I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may tend to incriminate me.' The City Attorney then moved the court to instruct the witness to answer, and if he failed to do so to hold him in contempt. The court asked petitioner's cocounsel what would be a reasonable time to allow for the witness to bring the magazines into court, because the court understood the applicable rule to require time for compliance before a motion for contempt should be entertained. Counsel replied that according to their position no time need be allowed because, in any event, the subpoena would require production of evidence which would tend to incriminate the witness. The court then recessed until the afternoon and instructed the witness to return at that time with the requested magazines. Petitioner's cocounsel said he understood the instruction.\n\n\n10\nWhen the court reconvened, McKelva was recalled, and he responded negatively when the City Attorney asked whether he had made any effort to obtain the subpoenaed magazines. He did, however, acknowledge that he had understood the court's order to bring them. After he indicated that the sole reason for his failure to comply was his belief that if he did so it would entail a substantial possibility of self-incrimination, the City Attorney again moved for a contempt citation. This time the court found McKelva in contempt and stated that the failure to respond would be treated as an admission that the subpoenaed magazines are obscene. Petitioner objected, arguing that a person may not be penalized for asserting a constitutional right by way of making an adverse finding against him. The judge replied that no finding had been made, but in view of petitioner's admission that the magazines were of the same nature as those for which his client previously had been convicted, there was justification for treating a refusal to produce them as an admission to be considered with other evidence.4 Petitioner responded that he was obliged to assert that although though the other magazines had been held obscene the subpoenaed magazines were not.\n\n\n11\nAfter other testimony was heard, McKelva was again recalled and the court asked him if his disobedience was his own decision, or if it was on the advice of counsel. McKelva replied that it was on the advice of counsel, specifically petitioner and Maley. Petitioner then asked his client whether he would produce the magazines if counsel advised him they were not incriminatory. McKelva replied that he would. This made it clear that but for the advice of counsel McKelva would have produced the subpoenaed matter.\n\n\n12\nAfter a short recess the court ruled the subpoenaed magazines obscene, and enjoined their continued exhibition and sale. Finally, the court held petitioner and his cocounsel in contempt, as well as their client,5 and fixed punishment for each of them at 10 days' confinement and a $200 fine.\n\n\n13\nThe judge noted his reluctance to find the attorneys in contempt, stating this was the first time he had ever done so, but he felt that the attorneys had usurped the authority of the court: 'This Court has not been permitted to rule on the admissibility of that evidence. You have ruled on it . . ..' Before the hearing ended, however, petitioner stated that he and his cocounsel had not deliberately and intentionally attempted to frustrate the court. Petitioner felt there was merely a philosophical difference between counsel and the court as to the scope of the Fifth Amendment protection. The court responded that the self-incrimination defense could have been reached either by a motion to suppress the evidence after it had been produced for injunctive purposes, or by an objection to an attempt to introduce it at a criminal trial.\n\n\n14\nThe record shows no indication whatsoever of contumacious conduct on the part of petitioner or his cocounsel. The court appears to have been offended, in a strictly legal sense, only by the lawyers' advice which caused their client to decline on Fifth Amendment grounds to produce subpoenaed material. There is nothing in the record to suggest that petitioner or his cocounsel acted otherwise than in the good-faith belief that if their client produced the materials he would run a substantial risk of self-incrimination.\n\n\n15\nThe day the contempt citation was issued petitioner, on behalf of McKelva, applied to the Supreme Court of Texas for an original writ of habeas corpus. The same day that court denied the application pending further information to complete the record, and then finally denied the writ on February 5, 1973.\n\n\n16\nOn February 8, 1973, petitioner filed an application on behalf of McKelva for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, Waco Division. However, at 10 a.m. that day the judge who issued the contempt citation ordered McKelva released from custody although he had only served seven of his 10 days. The release was 'for good behavior.'\n\n\n17\nPursuant to Texas procedure6 the citation of the attorneys was reviewed by another state district judge, the respondent here, Judge James R. Meyers. A hearing was held on May 11, 1973, with the Texas Attorney General's office appearing in support of the contempt citation. The parties agreed that the burden of proof was on the Attorney General, and also agreed that the record of the injunction hearing would provide the basis for the court's decision.\n\n\n18\nThe court noted that it felt that the record supported a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the client was advised not to bring the materials, and the court was dubious that materials displayed for public sale are protected by the Fifth Amendment. However, the court also stated, 'I think it is a very close point.' Counsel for petitioner agreed that the record clearly reflected that petitioner had advised his client that he had a Fifth Amendment privilege on the issue, but claimed that it did not reflect that petitioner had instructed him not to bring the subpoenaed materials.\n\n\n19\nOn October 1, 1973, Judge Meyers affirmed the finding of contempt but changed the penalty to a $500 fine with no confinement. It is that judgment which is under review here.\n\n\n20\nBoth Texas appellate courts refused to review the judgment. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied petitioner's motion for leave to file an original application for a writ of habeas corpus, and the Supreme Court of Texas also denied a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Both courts' orders were entered October 11. By order of Judge Meyers, personal recognizance bonds of petitioner and Maley were continued in order that Maley could seek a writ of habeas corpus from the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas and petitioner could petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court.\n\n\n21\nOn December 20, 1973, Judge Jack Roberts of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, Waco Division, granted Maley's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. He noted that even incorrect orders from courts ordinarily must be obeyed until set aside, but he concluded that McKelva had asserted a valid Fifth Amendment privilege, and therefore neither he nor his lawyer could be held in contempt for asserting that privilege. Since civil and criminal liability under Art. 527 arise from the same act the judge also concluded that the Fifth Amendment applied even in the injunctive action. Indeed, he noted that the leading case of Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886), involved forfeiture proceedings which, 'though they may be civil in form, are in their nature criminal.' Id., at 634, 6 S.Ct., at 534. He held that since Maley was only acting to protect rights guaranteed by the Constitution to his client, 'he cannot be held in contempt.'\n\n\n22\nAn appeal has been filed from that judgment and is now pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On April 15, 1974, we granted the petition for a writ of certiorari, 416 U.S. 934, 94 S.Ct. 1931, 40 L.Ed.2d 285; we are advised that the case is being held pending our decision in this case.\n\nII\n\n23\nThe narrow issue in this case is whether a lawyer may be held in contempt for advising his client, during the trial of a civil case, to refuse to produce material demanded by a subpoena duces tecum when the lawyer believes in good faith the material may tend to incriminate his client.\n\n\n24\nWe begin with the basic proposition that all orders and judgments of courts must be complied with promptly. If a person to whom a court directs an order believes that order is incorrect the remedy is to appeal, but, absent a stay, he must comply promptly with the order pending appeal. Persons who make private determinations of the law and refuse to obey an order generally risk criminal contempt even if the order is ultimately ruled incorrect. Howat v. Kansas, 258 U.S. 181, 189\u2014190, 42 S.Ct. 277, 280\u2014281, 66 L.Ed. 550 (1922); Worden v. Searls, 121 U.S. 14, 7 S.Ct. 814, 30 L.Ed. 853 (1887). The orderly and expeditious administration of justice by the courts requires that 'an order issued by a court with jurisdiction over the subject matter and person must be obeyed by the parties until it is reversed by orderly and proper proceedings.' United States v. United Mine Workers, 330 U.S. 258, 293, 67 S.Ct. 677, 696, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947). This principle is especially applicable to orders issued during trial. E.g., Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970). Such orders must be complied with promptly and completely, for the alternative would be to frustrate and disrupt the progress of the trial with issues collateral to the central questions in litigation. This does not mean, of course, that every ruling by a presiding judge must be accepted in silence. Counsel may object to a ruling. An objection alerts opposing counsel and the court to an issue so that the former may respond and the latter may be fully advised before ruling. United States v. La Franca, 282 U.S. 568, 570, 51 S.Ct. 278, 279, 75 L.Ed. 551 (1931). But, once the court has ruled, counsel and others involved in the action must abide by the ruling and comply with the court's orders. While claims of error may be preserved in whatever way the applicable rules provide, counsel should neither engage the court in extended discussion once a ruling is made, nor advise a client not to comply.7 A lawyer who counsels his client not to comply with a court order during trial would, first, subject his client to contempt, and in addition, if he persisted the lawyer would be exposed to sanctions for obstructing the trial. Remedies for judicial error may be cumbersome but the injury flowing from an error generally is not irreparable, and orderly processes are imperative to the operation of the adversary system of justice.\n\n\n25\nWhen a court during trial orders a witness to reveal information, however, a different situation may be presented. Compliance could cause irreparable injury because appellate courts cannot always 'unring the bell' once the information has been released. Subsequent appellate vindication does not necessarily have its ordinary consequence of totally repairing the error. In those situations we have indicated the person to whom such an order is directed has an alternative:\n\n\n26\n'(W)e have consistently held that the necessity for      expedition in the administration of the criminal law      justifies putting one who seeks to resist the production of      desired information to a choice between compliance with a      trial court's order to produce prior to any review of that      order, and resistance to that order with the concomitant      possibility of an adjudication of contempt if his claims are      rejected on appeal. Cobbledick v. United States, (309 U.S.      323, 60 S.Ct. 540, 84 L.Ed. 783 (1940)); Alexander v. United      States, 201 U.S. 117, 26 S.Ct. 356, 50 L.Ed. 686 (1906); cf.      United States v. Blue, 384 U.S. 251, 86 S.Ct. 1416, 16      L.Ed.2d 510 (1966); Di Bella v. United States, 369 U.S. 121,      82 S.Ct. 654, 7 L.Ed.2d 614 (1962); Carroll v. United States,      354 U.S. 394, 77 S.Ct. 1332, 1 L.Ed.2d 1442 (1957).' United      States v. Ryan, 402 U.S. 530, 532\u2014533, 91 S.Ct. 1580, 1582,      29 L.Ed.2d 85 (1971).\n\n\n27\nThis method of achieving precompliance review is particularly appropriate where the Fifth Amendment privilege8 against self-incrimination is involved. The privilege has ancient roots, see, e.g., Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591, 596\u2014597, 16 S.Ct. 644, 646-647, 40 L.Ed. 819 (1896); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 458\u2014463, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1619\u20141622, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966); see especially id., at 458 n. 27, 86 S.Ct., at 1619. This Court has always broadly construed its protection to assure that an individual is not compelled to produce evidence which later may be used against him as an accused in a criminal action. Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 562, 12 S.Ct. 195, 198, 35 L.Ed. 1110 (1892); Arndstein v. McCarthy, 254 U.S. 71, 72\u201473, 41 S.Ct. 26, 27, 65 L.Ed. 138 (1920). The protection does not merely encompass evidence which may lead to criminal conviction, but includes information which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence that could lead to prosecution, as well as evidence which an individual reasonably believes could be used against him in a criminal prosecution. Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486, 71 S.Ct. 814, 818, 95 L.Ed. 1118 (1951). In view of the place this privilege occupies in the Constitution and in our adversary system of justice, as well as the traditional respect for the individual that undergirds the privilege, the procedure described in Ryan seems an eminently reasonable method to allow precompliance review.\n\n\n28\nIn the present case the City Attorney argued that if petitioner's client produced the magazines he was amply protected because in any ensuing criminal action he could always move to suppress,9 or object on Fifth Amendment grounds to the introduction of the magazines into evidence. Laying to one side possible waiver problems that might arise if the witness followed that course, cf. Rogers v. United States, 340 U.S. 367, 71 S.Ct. 438, 95 L.Ed. 344 (1951), we nevertheless cannot conclude that it would afford adequate protection. Without something more10 'he would be compelled to surrender the very protection which the privilege is designed to guarantee.' Hoffman v. United States, supra, 341 U.S. at 486, 71 S.Ct. at 818.\n\n\n29\nOur views as to the effectiveness of a later objection or motion to suppress do not conflict with United States v. Blue, 384 U.S. 251, 86 S.Ct. 1416, 16 L.Ed.2d 510 (1966). There we said:\n\n\n30\n'Even if we assume that the Government did acquire      incriminating evidence in violation of the Fifth Amendment,      Blue would at most be entitled to suppress the evidence and      its fruits if they were sought to be used against him at      trial.' Id., at 255, 86 S.Ct., at 1419.\n\n\n31\nBut the crucial distinction between that case and the instant question is that there the Government indeed 'did acquire' the information. Blue had turned it over during a civil investigation without asserting the Fifth Amendment privilege. Here, on the contrary, petitioner's client had not yet delivered the subpoenaed material, and he consistently and vigorously asserted his privilege. Here the 'cat' was not yet 'out of the bag' and reliance upon a later objection or motion to suppress would 'let the cat out' with no assurance whatever of putting it back.\n\n\n32\nThus in advising his client to resist and risk a contempt citation, thereby allowing precompliance appellate review of the claim, petitioner counseled a familiar procedure. Although it is clear that noncompliance risked both an immediate contempt citation and a final criminal contempt judgment against the witness if, on appeal, petitioner's advice proved to be wrong, the issue here is whether petitioner, as counsel, can be penalized for good-faith advice to claim the privilege.\n\n\n33\nIt appears that here the trial judge rejected the Fifth Amendment claim primarily because it was raised in a civil11 and not a criminal case. The City Attorney relied most heavily on that distinction in his argument in opposition to the motion to quash.12 Just as vigorously, petitioner contended that the privilege against self-incrimination protected his client regardless of the nature of the proceeding. He said:\n\n\n34\n'It is very clear that the coverage of the Fifth Amendment is      not to be determined by the nature of the proceeding in which      it is asserted. The Fifth Amendment applies to all proceedings, to injunctive      proceedings, to administrative proceedings, and to criminal      proceedings. It applies to interrogation by Police Officers      out of Court. It applies across the board. We are not talking      about the context of the proceedings in which the privilege      against self-incrimination is asserted. We are talking about      the character of material that is sought to be taken from the      person who is subject to the subpoena.\n\n\n35\n'. . . (t)he test in those circumstances is whether there is      a substantial probability in requiring the party that is      served with the subpoena to produce the evidence, which      evidence would entail self-incrimination, and with the      production of the magazines for possible use in a criminal      prosecution, and we say that this would amount to a violation      of the privilege under the Fifth Amendment, and we contend      that it most certainly would, and that it must.' App. 13\u201414.\n\n\n36\nIn overruling the claimed privilege the trial judge seems to have accepted the City Attorney's contention that the claim is not available in a civil proceeding. We disagree.\n\n\n37\nIn Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972), we recently reaffirmed the principle that the privilege against self-incrimination can be asserted 'in any proceeding, civil or criminal, administrative or judicial, investigatory or adjudicatory.' Id., at 444, 92 S.Ct., at 1656; Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70, 77, 94 S.Ct. 316, 322, 38 L.Ed.2d 274 (1973); Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n, 378 U.S. 52, 94, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 1611, 12 L.Ed.2d 678 (1964) (White, J., concurring); McCarthy v. Arndstein, 266 U.S. 34, 40, 45 S.Ct. 16, 17, 69 L.Ed. 158 (1924); United States v. Saline Bank, 1 Pet. 100, 7 L.Ed. 69 (1828); cf. Gardner v. Broderick, 392 U.S. 273, 88 S.Ct. 1913, 20 L.Ed.2d 1082 (1968). The trial judge seems to have proceeded upon the mistaken premise that petitioner's client was misadvised even to assert the privilege in a civil proceeding, regardless of its ultimate merit. This error explains the severe sanction the court placed\u2014 albeit reluctantly\u2014upon petitioner because his advice seemed to have caused the witness' refusal to obey.13 Thus the issue is whether in a civil proceeding a lawyer may be held in contempt for counseling a witness in good faith to refuse to produce court-ordered materials on the ground that the materials may tend to incriminate the witness in another proceeding. We hold that on this record petitioner may not be penalized even though his advice caused the witness to disobey the court's order.\n\n\n38\nThe privilege against compelled self-incrimination would be drained of its meaning if counsel, being lawfully present,14 as here, could be penalized for advising his client in good faith to assert it. The assertion of a testimonial privilege, as of many other rights, often depends upon legal advice from someone who is trained and skilled in the subject matter, and who may offer a more objective opinion. A layman may not be aware of the precise scope, the nuances, and boundaries of his Fifth Amendment privilege.15 It is not a self-executing mechanism; it can be affirmatively waived, or lost by not asserting it in a timely fashion. If performance of a lawyer's duty to advise a client that a privilege is available exposes a lawyer to the threat of contempt for giving honest advice it is hardly debatable that some advocates may lose their zeal for forthrightness and independence.16\n\n\n39\nThere is a crucial distinction between citing a recalcitrant witness for contempt, United States v. Ryan, supra, and citing the witness' lawyer for contempt based only on advice given in good faith to assert the privilege against self-incrimination. The witness, once advised of the right, can choose for himself whether to risk contempt in order to test the privilege before evidence is produced. That decision is, and should be, for the witness. But, if his lawyer may be punished for advice so given there is a genuine risk that a witness exposed to possible self-incrimination will not be advised of his right. Then the witness may be deprived of the opportunity to decide whether or not to assert the privilege.\n\n\n40\nAn early example of this situation is found in In re Watts, 190 U.S. 1, 23 S.Ct. 718, 47 L.Ed. 933 (1903). There lawyers advised their clients in good faith that state, not federal, courts had bankruptcy jurisdiction over a certain property in the hands of a state receiver. This advice led to a collision between the state and federal courts, and contempt citations for the lawyers. Although this Court held that the lawyers' advice was substantively incorrect, it refused to allow the federal contempt convictions to stand because there was no evidence the advice was given in bad faith. Id., at 32, 23 S.Ct., at 726. Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, speaking for the Court, said:\n\n\n41\n'In the ordinary case of advice of clients, if an attorney      acts in good faith and in the honest belief that his advice      is well founded and in the just interests of his client, he      cannot be held liable for error in judgment. The preservation      of the independence of the bar is too vital to the due administration of justice      to allow of the application of any other general rule.' Id.,      at 29, 23 S.Ct., at 725.\n\n\n42\nWe conclude that an advocate is not subject to the penalty of contempt for advising his client, in good faith, to assert the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in any proceeding embracing the power to compel testimony. To hold otherwise would deny the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination the means of its own implementation. When a witness is so advised the advice becomes an integral part of the protection accorded the witness by the Fifth Amendment.\n\nIII\n\n43\nIn applying these principles it is important to note what this case does not involve: the claim is not based solely on privacy; this is not a case where state law is clear that a response to compulsory process under protest renders the response inadmissible in any criminal prosecution against the witness; most important, there is no contention here as to lack of good faith or reasonable grounds for assertion of a Fifth Amendment claim.\n\n\n44\nBoth in a pretrial written motion and orally during trial, petitioner cogently stated his reasons for believing the privilege applied:\n\n\n45\n'In view of the fact that there is this substantial      possibility of self-incrimination; in view of the fact that      seven other magazines that are of the same character as the .      . . magazines named in the subpoena, that they have provided      the basis for past criminal prosecutions; in view of the fact      that criminal prosecutions are not only a very definite      possibility, they are in fact a pronounced possibility, and      so there is little reasonable doubt in these circumstances      that the subpoena should be quashed because in fact it seeks to compel the person named in the      subpoena to incriminate himself, and, of course, this is      prohibited by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the      United States.' App. 9\u201410.\n\n\n46\nPetitioner stated that the magazines were 'of the same character'17 as magazines for distribution of which his client had recently suffered a criminal conviction. There was therefore, at the very least, a reasonable basis for petitioner to assume that a risk of further criminal prosecution existed.18 Both sides agree that the record is devoid of evidence of contumacious conduct or any disrespect for the court, cf. e.g., In re Little, 404 U.S. 553, 554\u2014555, 92 S.Ct. 659, 660, 30 L.Ed.2d 708 (1972). The highly professional tone of the proceeding is revealed by the statements of the judge, and by petitioner's closing comments to the judge after he had been cited for contempt:\n\n\n47\n'If it please the Court, I certainly appreciate the Court's      position. I think what we have here is not a situation, and I      hope this is correct, where Counsel have deliberately and      intentionally attempted to frustrate the Court. I think that      rather what we have is where there is a philosophical      difference between Counsel for the Defendant and the Court      with regard to the applicable law as to self-incrimination      and the production of evidence in a civil case.' App. 32.\n\n\n48\nOn this record, with no state statute or rule guaranteeing a privilege or assuring that at a later criminal prosecution the compelled magazines would be inadmissible, it appears that there was no avenue other than assertion of the privilege, with the risk of contempt, that would have provided assurance of appellate review in advance of surrendering the magazines. We are satisfied that petitioner properly performed his duties as an advocate here, and he cannot suffer any penalty for performing such duties in good faith.19\n\n\n49\nReversed.\n\n\n50\nMr. Justice STEWART, with whom Mr. Justice BLACKMUN joins, concurring in the result.\n\n\n51\nThe Court today holds that the constitutional privilege against compulsory self-incrimination embraces the right of a testifying party to the unfettered advice of counsel in a civil proceeding. As the Court puts the matter: a 'layman may not be aware of the precise scope, the nuances, and boundaries of his Fifth Amendment privilege. It is not a self-executing mechanism; it can be affirmatively waived, or lost by not asserting it in a timely fashion. . . . (I)f his lawyer may be punished for advice so given there is a genuine risk that a witness exposed to possible self-incrimination will not be advised of his right. Then the witness may be deprived of the opportunity to decide whether or not to assert the privilege.' Ante, at 466\u2014467.\n\n\n52\nThe premise underlying the conclusion that the constitutional privilege against compulsory self-incrimination includes the right to the unfettered advice of counsel in civil proceedings must be that there is a constitutional right, also derived from the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, to some advice of counsel concerning the privilege in the first place. The Court's rationale thus inexorably implies that counsel must be appointed for any indigent witness, whether or not he is a party, in any proceeding in which his testimony can be compelled. For surely few indigents will be more cognizant than was Maness' client of the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, let alone aware of the 'nuances' of the privilege. Unless counsel is appointed, these indigents will be deprived, just as surely as Maness' client would have been had he not been advised by Maness, of the opportunity to decide whether to assert their constitutional privilege. 'To hold otherwise would deny the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination the means of its own implementation.' Ante, at 468.\n\n\n53\nI am unwilling to go that far toward recognizing an unqualified right to appointed counsel in civil proceedings in a case that does not demand it. But I concur in the Court's judgment upon a wholly different ground.\n\n\n54\nMore than 40 years ago the Court recognized a due process right to retained counsel in civil proceedings. 'If in any case, civil or criminal, a state or federal court were arbitrarily to refuse to hear a party by counsel, employed by and appearing for him, it reasonably may not be doubted that such a refusal would be a denial of a hearing, and, therefore, of due process in the constitutional sense.' Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S.Ct. 55, 64, 77 L.Ed. 158. It requires no expansion of this well-established principle to hold that just as a state court may not arbitrarily prohibit retained counsel's presence in a courtroom, so too it may not arbitrarily prohibit or punish good-faith advice given by retained counsel. The 'right to be heard by counsel' is frustrated equally by denying the right to have counsel present during trial as by preventing counsel, once in the courtroom, from giving good-faith professional advice to his client.\n\n\n55\nThe right to be advised by retained counsel in a civil proceeding does not, of course, guarantee a lawyer absolute immunity for advice he gives to his client. Whether a contempt citation constitutes an arbitrary interference with the constitutionally protected attorney\u2014client relationship depends on both the tenor of the advice and the circumstances under which it is given. It does not depend solely on the nature of the legal issue involved. Advice to invoke a state-recognized testimonial privilege, for example, may be just as essential to the discharge of a lawyer's responsibility to his client as was Maness' advice to invoke the constitutional privilege against compulsory self-incrimination.\n\n\n56\nThe Court's opinion and Mr. Justice WHITE'S concurring opinion fully explain the circumstances that in this case justified Maness' advice to his client to refuse to comply with the trial judge's order to produce the subpoenaed material. Under these circumstances Maness did no more than properly perform the conventional service of a lawyer. To punish him for performing his professional duty in good faith would be an arbitrary interference with his client's right to the presence and advice of retained counsel\u2014and thus a denial of due process of law.\n\n\n57\nMr. Justice WHITE, concurring in the result.\n\n\n58\nThe issue in this case is not simply whether a lawyer may be held in contempt for advising his client to plead the Fifth Amendment. Obviously, put that way, he may not. The issue is whether, after his client's self-incrimination objection to testify or complying with a subpoena is overruled and his client is ordered to answer, the lawyer is in contempt of court when he advises the client not to obey the court's order. I agree with the Court's judgment that the contempt judgment against the lawyer cannot stand in the circumstances of this case.\n\n\n59\nAlthough the proceeding in which he is called is not criminal, it is established that a witness may not be required to answer a question if there is some rational basis for believing that it will incriminate him, at least without at that time being assured that neither it nor its fruits may be used against him. The object of the Amendment 'was to insure that a person should not be compelled, when acting as a witness in any investigation, to give testimony which might tend to show that he himself had committed a crime.' Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 562, 12 S.Ct. 195, 198, 35 L.Ed. 1110 (1892); McCarthy v. Arndstein, 266 U.S. 34, 40, 45 S.Ct. 16, 17, 69 L.Ed. 158 (1924); Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70, 77, 94 S.Ct. 316, 322, 38 L.Ed.2d 274 (1973). In any of these noncriminal contexts, therefore, 'a witness protected by the privilege may rightfully refuse to answer unless and until he is protected at least against the use of his compelled answers and evidence derived therefrom in any subsequent criminal case in which he is a defendant.' Id., at 78, 94 S.Ct., at 322; Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972).\n\n\n60\nIf the witness, having objected on Fifth Amendment grounds, is granted immunity against the use of his testimony and its fruits in a later prosecution, our cases hold that the danger of self-incrimination is removed and the privilege wholly satisfied. The purpose of the relevant part of the Fifth Amendment is to prevent compelled self-incrimination, not to protect private information. Testimony demanded of a witness may be very private indeed, but unless it is incriminating and protected by the Amendment or unless protected by one of the evidentiary privileges, it must be disclosed. When the objection interposed is that of self-incrimination, a grant of immunity removes any ground for a refusal to answer and for a goodfaith suggestion by counsel that the client not answer, however private his information may be. Should the attorney then advise his client not to answer, there should be no barrier to his conviction for contempt.\n\n\n61\nBut what of the case, such as we have here, where the claim of privilege is overruled because the witness has not carried his burden of demonstrating to the satisfaction of the trial judge that the sought-after answer may incriminate him and there is apparently no occasion for an assurance of immunity? It seems to me that in such event the witness is nevertheless protected by a constitutionally imposed use immunity if he answers in response to the order and under threat of contempt. If, contrary to the expectations of the judge but consistent with the claim of the witness and his lawyer, the State later finds the answer or its fruits incriminating and offers either against the witness in a criminal prosecution, the witness has a valid objection to the evidence on the ground that he was coerced by a court order to reveal it and that it is therefore compelled self-incrimination barred from use by the Fifth Amendment.\n\n\n62\nIn Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493, 87 S.Ct. 616, 17 L.Ed.2d 562 (1967), the State Attorney General summoned police officers to an inquiry into the fixing of traffic tickets. Following warnings that if they did not answer they would be removed from office and that anything they said might be used against them in a criminal proceeding, they were interrogated about the conduct of their official duties. No immunity of any kind was offered or available under state law. The questions were answered and the answers later used over their objections in a conspiracy prosecution of the officers. The Court held that 'the protection of the individual under the Fourteenth Amendment against coerced statements prohibits use in subsequent criminal proceedings of statements obtained under threat of removal from office, and that it extends to all, whether they are policemen or other members of our body politic.' Id., at 500, 87 S.Ct., at 620. Lefkowitz v. Turley, supra, reaffirmed this holding, 414 U.S., at 79\u201480, 94 S.Ct., at 323\u2014324, and declared that absent formal immunity protections, 'if he is nevertheless compelled to answer, his answers are inadmissible against him in a later criminal prosecution. Bram v. United States (168 U.S. 532, 18 S.Ct. 183, 42 L.Ed. 568 (1897)); Boyd v. United States (116 U.S. 616, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886)).' Id., at 78, 94 S.Ct., at 322.\n\n\n63\nGiven this ultimate immunity from being incriminated by his responses to his interrogation, a refusal to answer should subject the witness to contempt without the necessity of appellate review extending to the merits of the Fifth Amendment claim. If the State makes sufficiently clear that it recognizes this established rule, the attorney would have no business advising his client to disobey the court's order to answer. But the possibility, much less the reality, of a compelled answer, along with its fruits, being immunized from later use was hardly brought home to this petitioner or to his client. Had the client been granted immunity or had he been advised of its functional equivalent\u2014that although he was not immune from criminal prosecution with respect to the subject matter of his answers, neither his answer nor its fruits could later be used against him, Kastigar v. United States, supra it may well have been that his choice, and the advice of petitioner, would have been quite different.\n\n\n64\nAs the matter stands, nothing of the sort was clear in this case to either the petitioner or to his client. As far as can be ascertained from this record, the trial judge insisted that petitioner's client answer without any assurance then that the forthcoming answers could not be used to convict him in the event that the judge was wrong about their not being incriminating. I therefore agree that it was error to hold the attorney in contempt for advising his client not to answer. Cf. Lefkowitz v. Turley, supra; Gardner v. Broderick, 392 U.S. 273, 88 S.Ct. 1913, 20 L.Ed.2d 1082 (1968); Sanitation Men v. Sanitation Comm'r, 392 U.S. 280, 88 S.Ct. 1917, 20 L.Ed.2d 1089 (1968). At the very least, if there were still a live controversy between the State and petitioner's client, which apparently there is not, the contempt judgment would be vacated and the client would be given another opportunity to answer, having in mind the controlling constitutional principles. Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n, 378 U.S. 52, 80, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 1610, 12 L.Ed.2d 678 (1964).\n\n\n\n1\n Venon's Ann.Texas Penal Code, Art. 527 (Supp.1973), regulates distribution of obscene articles. Generally, it provides criminal penalties for specific acts of distribution. In \u00a7 13, however, it provides for an injunction to enforce its other provisions:\n'Sec. 13. The district courts of this State and the judges thereof shall have full power, authority, and jurisdiction, upon application by any district, county, or city attorney within their respective jurisdictions, or the Attorney General to issue any and all proper restraining orders, temporary and permanent injunctions, and any other writs and processes appropriate to carry out and enforce the provisions of this article. Such restraining orders or injunctions may issue to prevent any person from violating any of the provisions of this article. However, no restraining order or injunction shall issue except upon notice to the person sought to be enjoined. Such person shall be entitled to a trial of the issues within one day after joinder of issue and a decision shall be rendered by the court within two days of the conclusion of the trial. In the event that a final order or judgment of injunction be entered against the person sought to be enjoined, such final order or judgment shall contain a provision directing the person to surrender to the sheriff of the county in which the action was brought any obscene matter in his possession and such sheriff shall be directed to seize and destroy such matter.'\nThe entire article was repealed by Acts 1973, 63d Leg., c. 399, \u00a7 3(a), p. 992, effective January 1, 1974. The new law does not seem to have any provision equivalent to \u00a7 13.\n\n\n2\n The parties stipulated that the conviction had occurred and was then under appeal.\n\n\n3\n It appears that the Temple city criminal ordinance dealing with obscenity is substantially identical to the criminal provisions of Art 527. Texas Penal Code, Art. 527, \u00a7 12 (Supp.1973), provides:\n'Sec. 12. No city, county or other political subdivision may enact any regulation of obscene material which conflicts with the provisions of this Act; however, a city, county, or other political subdivision is authorized to regulate further the means and manner of distribution and exhibition of matter.'\nAt the hearing the court took judicial notice of the similarity between Art. 527 and the Temple criminal ordinance. App. 29.\n\n\n4\n The correctness of the conclusion as to inferences to be drawn from a witness' failure to respond is not before us for decision.\n\n\n5\n The only question presented here is the validity of the contempt penalty imposed upon the attorney. The validity of the contempt penalty imposed on petitioner's client is not before us.\n\n\n6\n 'Art. 1911a. Contempt; power of courts; penalties\n'Penalties for contempt\n'Sec. 2. (a) Every court other than a justice court or municipal court may punish by a fine of not more than $500, or by confinement in the county jail for not more than six months, or both, any person guilty of contempt of the court.\n'(c) Provided, however, an officer of a court held in contempt by a trial court, shall, upon proper motion filed in the offended court, be released upon his own personal recognizance pending a determination of his guilt or innocence by a judge of a district court, other than the offended court. Said judge to be appointed for that purpose by the presiding judge of the Administrative Judicial District wherein the alleged contempt occurred.\n'Confinement to enforce order\n'Sec. 3. Nothing in this Act affects a court's power to confine a contemner in order to compel him to obey a court order.' Vernon's Ann.Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat., Art. 1911 (Supp.1974\u20141975).\n\n\n7\n In a case dealing with misconduct of attorneys but decided under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Mr. Justice Jackson discussed these same elementary propositions:\n'Of course, it is the right of counsel for every litigant to press his claim, even if it appears farfetched and untenable, to obtain the court's considered ruling. Full enjoyment of that right, with due allowance for the heat of controversy, will be protected by appellate courts when infringed by trial courts. But if the ruling is adverse, it is not counsel's right to resist or to insult the judge\u2014his right is only respectfully to preserve his point for appeal. During a trial lawyers must speak, each in his own time and within his allowed time, and with relevance and moderation. These are such obvious matters that we should not remind the bar of them were it not for the misconceptions manifest in this case.' Sacher v. United States, 343 U.S. 1, 9, 72 S.Ct. 451, 455, 96 L.Ed. 717 (1952).\n\n\n8\n This case deals only with the privilege against self-incrimination contained in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964). The constitutional basis for this privilege distinguishes it from other privileges established by state statute or common law such as those arising from the relation of priest and penitent, lawyer and client, physician and patient, and husband and wife. We are not now presented with questions as to the scope of privileges not found in the Constitution.\n\n\n9\n Counsel for respondent could cite no Texas statute or case giving assurance that the magazines would be suppressed because they were produced involuntarily so the witness could avoid a contempt citation.\n\n\n10\n It is important here that the witness was not granted immunity from prosecution on the basis of any magazines he might produce. Quite the contrary, he was ordered to produce after vulnerability to prosecution had been made only too clear to him. In response to the City Attorney's assertion that he did not intend to prosecute based on the magazines, petitioner noted that the State or county might still prosecute, supra, at 452, 453, and neither the City Attorney nor the judge disagreed. See n. 9, supra.\nHad the witness been granted formal immunity a different case would be presented; in that event a witness may be compelled to testify. Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). If counsel, in the face of a grant of immunity, advised his client not to testify or produce information, a different question would be presented because the good faith of the attorney would be open to doubt.\n\n\n11\n Petitioner also argued, as we noted earlier, that the proceeding was not civil at all but rather was 'quasi criminal.' App. 10. He noted that the proceeding was based upon 'the provisions of Section 13 of Article 527 of the Taxas Penal Code.' Ibid. He viewed the injunctive action as a mere prelude to a criminal prosecution. Thus he contended that the city should have sought the magazines with a search warrant instead of a subpoena duces tecum.\n\n\n12\n Id., at 12.\n\n\n13\n Petitioner readily concedes that his advice indeed caused his client to disobey the order. When the court gave petitioner's client a final chance to purge himself of the contempt citation this colloquy took place:\n'THE COURT: Mr. McKelva, you have been adjudged to be in contempt of this Court for having failed to observe a subpoena duces tecum to bring certain matters with you as a witness. In your testimony with reference to why you failed to do this, you first indicated that it was on the advice of Counsel that you were declining to obey the subpoena, and so I want to ask you directly this morning, is your disobedience to this subpoena your own decision, or is it on the advice of Counsel, and if so, what Counsel?\n'A. It is on the advice of Counsel, sir, and Mr. Friedman, Mr. Maley and Mr. Maness.\n'THE COURT: Does either Counsel have any questions that they want to ask this witness?\n'MR. MANESS: Your Honor, I would only like to ask Mr. McKelva, in the event that his Counsel were to advise him that his privileges against self-incrimination were not endangered by producing the . . . magazines in question, whether or not under those circumstances he would produce the magazines?\n'A. I would.' App. 27.\nCounsel thus took full responsibility for his client's acts, as, of course, his duty to his client required.\n\n\n14\n Under Texas procedure and the rulings of the trial court in this case the client was undoubtedly entitled to consult with counsel at the times and in the manner he did.\n\n\n15\n Mr. Justice Stewart would appear to extend our reasoning far beyond the confines of this case. We do not agree that our reasoning leads 'inexorably' to his conclusion. We have here a case where retained counsel, in a proceeding which he strenuously argued was not civil but quasi-criminal, has been held in contempt for advising his client that he may assert the Fifth Amendment privilege.\nReliance seems to us misplaced on the statement in Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932), that '(i)f in any case, civil or criminal, a state or federal court were arbitrarily to refuse to hear a party by counsel, employed by and appearing for him . . . such a refusal would be a denial of a hearing, and, therefore, of due process . . ..' Comments in a criminal case as to the law in a civil case hardly reach the level of constitutional doctrine, if indeed they are any more than dicta. From these dicta it is argued that it as much violates due process to punish an attorney for advising a witness of a privilege as to prevent the attorney from appearing at all; also that a contempt citation may 'constitute an arbitrary interference with the constitutionally protected attorney-client relationship,' post, at 472, even where no constitutional privilege is involved. We need not go so far nor travel such a circuitous route to reach our conclusion here. We are not aware that the Court has ever identified a 'constitutionally protected attorney-client' privilege of the scope postulated by Mr. Justice Stewart.\n\n\n16\n The American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Defense Function \u00a7 1.6 (Approved Draft 1971) shows the difficulty such a situation would present for a lawyer:\n'(T)he duties of a lawyer to his client are to represent his legitimate interests, and considerations of personal and professional advantage should not influence his advice or performance.' The introductory comments note:\n'A lawyer cannot be timorous in his representation. Courage and zeal in the defense of his client's interest are qualities without which one cannot fully perform as an advocate.' Id., at 146.\n\n\n17\n Petitioner's concession that the subpoenaed magazines were of the same character was not an admission they were obscene. His contention seems to have been that they were sufficiently like those for which his client previously had been convicted as to raise the possibility of prosecution, and thus to allow assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege.\n\n\n18\n In view of our disposition of this case upon other grounds we need not, and do not, decide whether the Fifth Amendment privilege actually encompasses these magazines.\n\n\n19\n We recognize that there may be instances where advice to plead the Fifth Amendment could be given in bad faith, or could be patently frivolous or for purposes of delay, and such instances would present far different issues from those here. See Cole v. United States, 329 F.2d 437 (CA9), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 954, 84 S.Ct. 1630, 12 L.Ed.2d 497 (1964); United States v. Cioffi, 493 F.2d 1111, 1119 (CA2), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 917, 95 S.Ct. 195, 42 L.Ed.2d 155 (1974).\n\n\n","label":0}

Carlson, Iowa City, Iowa, for petitioner.\nWilliam A. Claerhout, Des Moines, Iowa, for respondent.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nIn 1934, petitioner was indicted for murdering a policeman in Burlington, Iowa. Petitioner claimed that he was innocent and that he had not been present at the scene of the crime. At the trial, several witnesses testified that petitioner had been in Des Moines, 165 miles away from Burlington, on the day that the crime was committed. The trial judge instructed the jury that for the petitioner to be entitled to an acquittal on the ground that he was not present at the scene of the crime, the petitioner must have shown by a preponderance of the evidence that he was not present.1 The jury found petitioner guilty of second-degree murder, and petitioner was sentenced to life imprisonment. His conviction was affirmed by the Iowa Supreme Court. State v. Johnson, 221 Iowa 8, 264 N.W. 596, 267 N.W. 91 (1936).2\n\n\n2\nIn this habeas corpus proceeding, petitioner argued, among other points, that the State had denied him due process of law by placing on him the burden of proving the alibi defense. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa rejected this argument and denied the petition. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 386 F.2d 677 (1967). We granted certiorari to consider the constitutionality of the alibi instruction, along with other issues. 390 U.S. 1002, 88 S.Ct. 1247, 20 L.Ed.2d 102 (1968).3 After we granted certiorari the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting en banc, held in another case that the Iowa rule shifting to the defendant the burden of proving an alibi defense violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Stump v. Bennett, 398 F.2d 111 (1968).4 In view of that holding, we vacate the decision in this case and remand to that court for reconsideration.5\n\n\n3\nMr. Justice BLACK dissents.\n\n\n\n1\n The instruction was as follows:\n'The burden is upon the defendant to prove (the) defense (of alibi) by a preponderance of the evidence, that is, by the greater weight or superior evidence. The defense of alibi to be entitled to be considered as established must show that at the very time of the commission of the crime the accused was at another place so far away, or under such circumstances that he could not with ordinary exertion have reached the place where the crime was committed so as to have committed the same. If by a preponderance of the evidence the defendant has so shown, the defense must be considered established and the defendant would be entitled to an acquittal. But if the proof of alibi has failed so to show, you will not consider it established or proved. The evidence by the jury, and if upon the considered by the jury, and if upon the whole case including the evidence of an alibi, there is a reasonable doubt of defendant's guilt, you should acquit him.'\n\n\n2\n See also State v. Johnson, 221 Iowa 8, 21, 267 N.W. 91 (1936), in which the Iowa Supreme Court corrected certain errors made in its original opinion.\n\n\n3\n The other issues were whether the State had supp essed evidence favorable to petitioner and intentionally used false evidence at petitioner's trial, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n4\n The instruction in Stump was similar to the one in the present case. The Court of Appeals rejected the State's contention that any error was harmless because the jury was also instructed that the State had the burden of proving 'the crime as a whole' beyond a reasonable doubt. The court pointed out that, in view of the instruction's inconsistency, reasonable minds could infer that the defendant retained the burden of proving nonpresence. 398 F.2d at 116, 121\u2014122.\n\n\n5\n In Stump, the Court of Appeals said: '(W)e are not directly faced with issues of retroactivity. We recognize that a panel of this court in Johnson v. Bennett, also a habeas corpus proceeding by an Iowa state prisoner, refused relief as to a number of matters, including the alibi instruction. The Johnson case concededly has some factual distinctions from the present one. Also significant is the fact that in the Stump case, unlike Johnson, counsel has carefully preserved by objections throughout the trial and appellate procedures his argument as to the unconstitutionality of the instruction.' (Citations omitted.) 398 F.2d at 122\u2014123. We express no opinion as to the validity of the distinctions suggested by the Court of Appeals. Instead, we deem it appropriate to remand to that court for a definite ruling on the issue.\n\n\n","label":0}

Appellees sought a declaratory judgment that Georgia's procedures for voluntary commitment of children under the age of 18 to state mental hospitals violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and requested an injunction against their future enforcement.  Under the Georgia statute providing for the voluntary admission of children to state regional hospitals, admission begins with an application for hospitalization signed by a parent or guardian and, upon application, the superintendent of the hospital is authorized to admit temporarily any child for \"observation and diagnosis.\"  If after observation the superintendent finds \"evidence of mental illness\" and that the child is \"suitable for treatment\" in the hospital, the child may be admitted \"for such period and under such conditions as may be authorized by law.\"  Under Georgia's mental health statute, any child who has been hospitalized for more than five days may be discharged at the request of a parent or guardian, and the hospital superintendent, even without a request for discharge, has an affirmative duty to release any child \"who has recovered from his mental illness or who has sufficiently improved that the superintendent determines that hospitalization of the patient is no longer desirable.\"  The District Court held that Georgia's statutory scheme was unconstitutional because it failed to protect adequately the appellees' due process rights and that the process due included at least the right after notice to an adversary-type hearing before an impartial tribunal.\nHeld :  The District Court erred in holding unconstitutional the State's procedures for admitting a child for treatment to a state mental hospital, since on the record in this case, Georgia's medical factfinding processes are consistent with constitutional guarantees.  Pp. 598-621.\n(a) Testing challenged state procedures under a due process claim requires a balancing of (i) the private interest that will be affected by the official action;  (ii) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards;  and (iii) the state's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.

Pp. 599-600.\n(b) Notwithstanding a child's liberty interest in not being confined unnecessarily for medical treatment, and assuming that a person has a protectible interest in not being erroneously labeled as mentally ill, parents\u2014who have traditional interests in and responsibility for the upbringing of their child\u2014retain a substantial, if not the dominant, role in the decision, absent a finding of neglect or abuse.  However, the child's rights and the nature of the commitment decision are such that parents do not always have absolute discretion to institutionalize a child;  they retain plenary authority to seek such care for their children, subject to an independent medical judgment.  Cf. Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070;  Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15;  Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645;  Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042.  Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788, distinguished.  Pp. 2503-2505.\n(c) The State has significant interests in confining the use of costly mental health facilities to cases of genuine need, in not imposing unnecessary procedural obstacles that may discourage the mentally ill or their families from seeking needed psychiatric assistance, and in allocating priority to the diagnosis and treatment of patients as soon as they are admitted to a hospital rather than to time-consuming preadmission procedures.  Pp. 604-606.\n(d) The risk of error inherent in the parental decision to have a child institutionalized for mental health care is sufficiently great that some kind of inquiry should be made by a \"neutral factfinder\" to determine whether the statutory requirements for admission are satisfied, see Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 271, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 1022, 25 L.Ed.2d 287;  Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 489, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2604, 33 L.Ed.2d 484, and to probe the child's background.  The decisionmaker must have the authority to refuse to admit any child who does not satisfy the medical standards for admission.  The need for continuing commitment must be reviewed periodically.  Pp. 606-607.\n(e) Due process does not require that the neutral factfinder be law trained or a judicial or administrative officer;  nor is it necessary that the admitting physician conduct a formal or quasi-formal adversary hearing or that the hearing be conducted by someone other than the admitting physician.  While the medical decisionmaking process may not be error free, nevertheless the independent medical decisionmaking process, which includes a thorough psychiatric investigation followed by additional periodic review of a child's condition will identify children who should not be admitted; risks of error will not be significantly reduced by a more formal, judicial-type hearing.  Pp. 607-613.\n(f) Georgia's practices, as described in the record, comport with minimum due process requirements.  The state statute envisions a careful diagnostic medical inquiry to be conducted by the admitting physician at each regional hospital.  Georgia's procedures are not \"arbitrary\" in the sense that a single physician or other professional has the \"unbridled discretion\" to commit a child to a regional hospital.  While Georgia's general administrative and statutory scheme for the voluntary commitment of children is not unconstitutional, the District Court, on remand, may consider any individual claims that the initial admissions of particular children did not meet due process standards, and may also consider whether the various hospitals' procedures for periodic review of their patients' need for institutional care are sufficient to justify continuing a voluntary commitment.  Pp. 613-617.\n(g) The differences between the situation where the child is a ward of the State of Georgia and the State requests his admission to a state mental hospital, and the situation where the child's natural parents request his admission, do not justify requiring different procedures at the time of the child's initial admission to the hospital.  Pp. 617-620.\n412 F.Supp. 112, reversed and remanded.\nR. Douglas Lackey, Atlanta, Ga., for appellants.\nJohn L. Cromartie, Jr., Atlanta, Ga., for appellees.\nMr. Chief Justice BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe question presented in this appeal is what process is constitutionally due a minor child whose parents or guardian seek state administered institutional mental health care for the child and specifically whether an adversary proceeding is required prior to or after the commitment.\n\n\n2\n* (a) Appellee1 J. R., a child being treated in a Georgia state mental hospital, was a plaintiff in this class action2 based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, in the District Court for the Middle District of Georgia.  Appellants are the State's Commissioner of the Department of Human Resources, the Director of the Mental Health Division of the Department of Human Resources, and the Chief Medical Officer at the hospital where appellee was being treated.  Appellee sought a declaratory judgment that Georgia's voluntary commitment procedures for children under the age of 18, Ga.Code \u00a7\u00a7 88-503.1, 88-503.2 (1975),3 violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and requested an injunction against their future enforcement.\n\n\n3\nA three-judge District Court was convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2281 (1970 ed.) and 2284.  After considering expert and lay testimony and extensive exhibits and after visiting two of the State's regional mental health hospitals, the District Court held that Georgia's statutory scheme was unconstitutional because it failed to protect adequately the appellees' due process rights. J. L. v. Parham, 412 F.Supp. 112, 139 (1976).\n\n\n4\nTo remedy this violation, the court enjoined future commitments based on the procedures in the Georgia statute.  It also commanded Georgia to appropriate and expend whatever amount was \"reasonably necessary\" to provide nonhospital facilities deemed by the appellant state officials to be the most appropriate for the treatment of those members of plaintiffs' class, n. 2, supra, who could be treated in a less drastic, nonhospital environment.  412 F.Supp., at 139.\n\n\n5\nAppellants challenged all aspects of the District Court's judgment.  We noted probable jurisdiction, 431 U.S. 936, 97 S.Ct. 2647, 53 L.Ed.2d 253, and heard argument during the 1977 Term. The case was then consolidated with Secretary of Public Welfare v. Institutionalized Juveniles, 442 U.S. 640, 99 S.Ct. 2523, 61 L.Ed.2d 142, and reargued this Term.\n\n\n6\n(b) J. L., a plaintiff before the District Court who is now deceased, was admitted in 1970 at the age of 6 years to Central State Regional Hospital in Milledgeville, Ga.  Prior to his admission, J. L. had received out-patient treatment at the hospital for over two months.  J. L.'s mother then requested the hospital to admit him indefinitely.\n\n\n7\nThe admitting physician interviewed J. L. and his parents. He learned that J. L.'s natural parents had divorced and his mother had remarried.  He also learned that J. L. had been expelled from school because he was uncontrollable.  He accepted the parents' representation that the boy had been extremely aggressive and diagnosed the child as having a \"hyperkinetic reaction of childhood.\"\n\n\n8\nJ. L.'s mother and stepfather agreed to participate in family therapy during the time their son was hospitalized.  Under this program, J. L. was permitted to go home for short stays. Apparently his behavior during these visits was erratic.  After several months, the parents requested discontinuance of the program.\n\n\n9\nIn 1972, the child was returned to his mother and stepfather on a furlough basis, i. e., he would live at home but go to school at the hospital.  The parents found they were unable to control J. L. to their satisfaction, and this created family stress.  Within two months, they requested his readmission to Central State.  J. L.'s parents relinquished their parental rights to the county in 1974.\n\n\n10\nAlthough several hospital employees recommended that J. L. should be placed in a special foster home with \"a warm, supported, truly involved couple,\" the Department of Family and Children Services was unable to place him in such a setting.  On October 24, 1975, J. L. (with J. R.) filed this suit requesting an order of the court placing him in a less drastic environment suitable to his needs.\n\n\n11\n(c) Appellee J. R. was declared a neglected child by the county and removed from his natural parents when he was three months old.  He was placed in seven different foster homes in succession prior to his admission to Central State Hospital at the age of 7.\n\n\n12\nImmediately preceding his hospitalization, J. R. received outpatient treatment at a county mental health center for several months.  He then began attending school where he was so disruptive and incorrigible that he could not conform to normal behavior patterns.  Because of his abnormal behavior, J. R.'s seventh set of foster parents requested his removal from their home.  The Department of Family and Children Services then sought his admission at Central State.  The agency provided the hospital with a complete sociomedical history at the time of his admission.  In addition, three separate interviews were conducted with J. R. by the admission team of the hospital.\n\n\n13\nIt was determined that he was borderline retarded, and suffered an \"unsocialized, aggressive reaction of childhood.\"  It was recommended unanimously that he would \"benefit from the structured environment\" of the hospital and would \"enjoy living and playing with boys of the same age.\"\n\n\n14\nJ. R.'s progress was re-examined periodically.  In addition, unsuccessful efforts were made by the Department of Family and Children Services during his stay at the hospital to place J. R. in various foster homes.  On October 24, 1975, J. R. (with J. L.) filed this suit requesting an order of the court placing him in a less drastic environment suitable to his needs.\n\n\n15\n(d) Georgia Code \u00a7 88-503.1 (1975) provides for the voluntary admission to a state regional hospital of children such as J. L. and J. R.  Under that provision, admission begins with an application for hospitalization signed by a \"parent or guardian.\" Upon application, the superintendent of each hospital is given the power to admit temporarily any child for \"observation and diagnosis.\"  If, after observation, the superintendent finds \"evidence of mental illness\" and that the child is \"suitable for treatment\" in the hospital, then the child may be admitted \"for such period and under such conditions as may be authorized by law.\"\n\n\n16\nGeorgia's mental health statute also provides for the discharge of voluntary patients.  Any child who has been hospitalized for more than five days may be discharged at the request of a parent or guardian.  \u00a7 88-503.3(a) (1975).  Even without a request for discharge, however, the superintendent of each regional hospital has an affirmative duty to release any child \"who has recovered from his mental illness or who has sufficiently improved that the superintendent determines that hospitalization of the patient is no longer desirable.\"  \u00a7 88-503.2 (1975).\n\n\n17\nGeorgia's Mental Health Director has not published any statewide regulations defining what specific procedures each superintendent must employ when admitting a child under 18. Instead, each regional hospital's superintendent is responsible for the procedures in his or her facility.  There is substantial variation among the institutions with regard to their admission procedures and their procedures for review of patients after they have been admitted.  A brief description of the different hospitals' procedures4 will demonstrate the variety of approaches taken by the regional hospitals throughout the State.\n\n\n18\nSouthwestern Hospital in Thomasville, Ga., was built in 1966. Its children and adolescent program was instituted in 1974.  The children and adolescent unit in the hospital has a maximum capacity of 20 beds, but at the time of suit only 10 children were being treated there.\n\n\n19\nThe Southwestern superintendent testified that the hospital has never admitted a voluntary child patient who was not treated previously by a community mental health clinic.  If a mental health professional at the community clinic determines that hospital treatment may be helpful for a child, then clinic staff and hospital staff jointly evaluate the need for hospitalization, the proper treatment during hospitalization, and a likely release date.  The initial admission decision thus is not made at the hospital.\n\n\n20\nAfter a child is admitted, the hospital has weekly reviews of his condition performed by its internal medical and professional staff.  There also are monthly reviews of each child by a group composed of hospital staff not involved in the weekly reviews and by community clinic staff people.  The average stay for each child who was being treated at Southwestern in 1975 was 100 days.\n\n\n21\nAtlanta Regional Hospital was opened in 1968.  At the time of the hearing before the District Court, 17 children and 21 adolescents were being treated in the hospital's children and adolescent unit.\n\n\n22\nThe hospital is affiliated with nine community mental health centers and has an agreement with them that \"persons will be treated in the comprehensive community mental health centers in every possible instance, rather than being hospitalized.\"  The admission criteria at Atlanta Regional for voluntary and involuntary patients are the same.  It has a formal policy not to admit a voluntary patient unless the patient is found to be a threat to himself or others.  The record discloses that approximately 25% of all referrals from the community centers are rejected by the hospital admissions staff.\n\n\n23\nAfter admission, the staff reviews the condition of each child every week.  In addition, there are monthly utilization reviews by nonstaff mental health professionals;  this review considers a random sample of children's cases.  The average length of each child's stay in 1975 was 161 days.\n\n\n24\nThe Georgia Mental Health Institute (GMHI) in Decatur, Ga., was built in 1965.  Its children and adolescent unit housed 26 children at the time this suit was brought.\n\n\n25\nThe hospital has a formal affiliation with four community mental health centers.  Those centers may refer patients to the hospital only if they certify that \"no appropriate alternative resources are available within the client's geographic area.\"  For the year prior to the trial in this case, no child was admitted except through a referral from a clinic.  Although the hospital has a policy of generally accepting for 24 hours all referrals from a community clinic, it has a team of staff members who review each admission.  If the team finds \"no reason not to treat in the community\" and the deputy superintendent of the hospital agrees, then it will release the applicant to his home.\n\n\n26\nAfter a child is admitted, there must be a review of the admission decision within 30 days.  There is also an unspecified periodic review of each child's need for hospitalization by a team of staff members.  The average stay for the children who were at GMHI in 1975 was 346 days.\n\n\n27\nAugusta Regional Hospital was opened in 1969 and is affiliated with 10 community mental health clinics.  Its children and adolescent unit housed 14 children in December 1975.\n\n\n28\nApproximately 90% of the children admitted to the hospital have first received treatment in the community, but not all of them were admitted based on a specific referral from a clinic. The admission criterion is whether \"the child needs hospitalization,\" and that decision must be approved by two psychiatrists.  There is also an informal practice of not admitting a child if his parents refuse to participate in a family therapy program.\n\n\n29\nThe admission decision is reviewed within 10 days by a team of staff physicians and mental health professionals;  thereafter each child is reviewed every week.  In addition, every child's condition is reviewed by a team of clinic staff members every 100 days.  The average stay for the children at Augusta in December 1975 was 92 days.\n\n\n30\nSavannah Regional Hospital was built in 1970, and it housed 16 children at the time of this suit.  The hospital staff members are also directors of the community mental health clinics.\n\n\n31\nIt is the policy of the hospital that any child seeking admission on a nonemergency basis must be referred by a community clinic.  The admission decision must be made by a staff psychiatrist, and it is based on the materials provided by the community clinic, an interview with the applicant, and an interview with the parents, if any, of the child.\n\n\n32\nWithin three weeks after admission of a child, there is review by a group composed of hospital and clinic staff members and people from the community, such as juvenile court judges. Thereafter, the hospital staff reviews each child weekly.  If the staff concludes that a child is ready to be released, then the community committee reviews the child's case to assist in placement.  The average stay of the children being treated at Savannah in December 1975 was 127 days.\n\n\n33\nWest Central Hospital in Columbus, Ga., was opened in December 1974, and it was organized for budgetary purposes with several community mental health clinics.  The hospital itself has only 20 beds for children and adolescents, 16 of which were occupied at the time this suit was filed.\n\n\n34\nThere is a formal policy that all children seeking admission to the hospital must be referred by a community clinic.  The hospital is regarded by the staff as \"the last resort in treating a child\";  50% of the children referred are turned away by the admissions team at the hospital.\n\n\n35\nAfter admission, there are staff meetings daily to discuss problem cases.  The hospital has a practicing child psychiatrist who reviews cases once a week.  Depending on the nature of the problems, the consultant reviews between 1 and 20 cases.  The average stay of the children who were at West Central in December 1975 was 71 days.\n\n\n36\nThe children's unit at Central State Regional Hospital in Milledgeville, Ga., was added to the existing structure during the 1970's.  It can accommodate 40 children.  The hospital also can house 40 adolescents.  At the time of suit, the hospital housed 37 children under 18, including both named plaintiffs.\n\n\n37\nAlthough Central State is affiliated with community clinics, it seems to have a higher percentage of nonreferral admissions than any of the other hospitals.  The admission decision is made by an \"admissions evaluator\" and the \"admitting physician.\"  The evaluator is a Ph.D. in psychology, a social worker, or a mental-health-trained nurse.  The admitting physician is a psychiatrist.  The standard for admission is \"whether or not hospitalization is the more appropriate treatment\" for the child. From April 1974 to November 1975, 9 of 29 children applicants screened for admission were referred to noninstitutional settings.\n\n\n38\nAll children who are temporarily admitted are sent to the children and adolescent unit for testing and development of a treatment plan.  Generally, seven days after the admission, members of the hospital staff review all of the information compiled about a patient \"to determine the need for continued hospitalization.\"  Thereafter, there is an informal review of the patient approximately every 60 days.  The patients who were at Central State in December 1975 had been there, on the average, 456 days.  There is no explanation in the record for this large variation from the average length of hospitalization at the other institutions.\n\n\n39\nAlthough most of the focus of the District Court was on the State's mental hospitals, it is relevant to note that Georgia presently funds over 50 community mental health clinics and 13 specialized foster care homes.  The State has built seven new regional hospitals within the past 15 years, and it has added a new children's unit to its oldest hospital.  The state budget in fiscal year 1976 was almost $150 million for mental health care. Georgia ranks 22d among the states in per capita expenditures for mental health and 15th in total expenditures.5\n\n\n40\nThe District Court nonetheless rejected the State's entire system of providing mental health care on both procedural and substantive grounds.  The District Court found that 46 children could be \"optimally cared for in another, less restrictive, non-hospital setting if it were available.\"  412 F.Supp., at 124-125.  These \"optimal\" settings included group homes, therapeutic camps, and home-care services.  The Governor of Georgia and the chairmen of the two Appropriations Committees of its legislature, testifying in the District Court, expressed confidence in the Georgia program and informed the court that the State could not justify enlarging its budget during fiscal year 1977 to provide the specialized treatment settings urged by appellees in addition to those then available.\n\n\n41\nHaving described the factual background of Georgia's mental health program and its treatment of the named plaintiffs, we turn now to examine the legal bases for the District Court's judgment.\n\nII\n\n42\nIn holding unconstitutional Georgia's statutory procedure for voluntary commitment of juveniles, the District Court first determined that commitment to any of the eight regional hospitals6 constitutes a severe deprivation of a child's liberty. The court defined this liberty interest in terms of both freedom from bodily restraint and freedom from the \"emotional and psychic harm\" caused by the institutionalization.7  Having determined that a liberty interest is implicated by a child's admission to a mental hospital, the court considered what process is required to protect that interest.  It held that the process due \"includes at least the right after notice to be heard before an impartial tribunal.\"  412 F.Supp., at 137.\n\n\n43\nIn requiring the prescribed hearing, the court rejected Georgia's argument that no adversary-type hearing was required since the State was merely assisting parents who could not afford private care by making available treatment similar to that offered in private hospitals and by private physicians.  The court acknowledged that most parents who seek to have their children admitted to a state mental hospital do so in good faith.  It, however, relied on one of appellees' witnesses who expressed an opinion that \"some still look upon mental hospitals as a 'dumping ground.' \"  Id., at 138.8  No specific evidence of such \"dumping,\" however, can be found in the record.\n\n\n44\nThe District Court also rejected the argument that review by the superintendents of the hospitals and their staffs was sufficient to protect the child's liberty interest.  The court held that the inexactness of psychiatry, coupled with the possibility that the sources of information used to make the commitment decision may not always be reliable, made the superintendent's decision too arbitrary to satisfy due process. The court then shifted its focus drastically from what was clearly a procedural due process analysis to what appears to be a substantive due process analysis and condemned Georgia's \"officialdom\" for its failure, in the face of a state-funded 1973 report9 outlining the \"need\" for additional resources to be spent on nonhospital treatment, to provide more resources for noninstitutional mental health care.  The court concluded that there was a causal relationship between this intransigence and the State's ability to provide any \"flexible due process\" to the appellees.  The District Court therefore ordered the State to appropriate and expend such resources as would be necessary to provide nonhospital treatment to those members of appellees' class who would benefit from it.\n\nIII\n\n45\nIn an earlier day, the problems inherent in coping with children afflicted with mental or emotional abnormalities were dealt with largely within the family.  See S. Brakel & R. Rock, The Mentally Disabled and the Law 4 (1971).  Sometimes parents were aided by teachers or a family doctor.  While some parents no doubt were able to deal with their disturbed children without specialized assistance, others especially those of limited means and education, were not.  Increasingly, they turned for assistance to local, public sources or private charities. Until recently, most of the states did little more than provide custodial institutions for the confinement of persons who were considered dangerous.  Id., at 5-6;  Slovenko, Criminal Justice Procedures in Civil Commitment, 24 Wayne L.Rev. 1, 3 (1977) (hereinafter Slovenko).\n\n\n46\nAs medical knowledge about the mentally ill and public concern for their condition expanded, the states, aided substantially by federal grants,10 have sought to ameliorate the human tragedies of seriously disturbed children.  Ironically, as most states have expanded their efforts to assist the mentally ill, their actions have been subjected to increasing litigation and heightened constitutional scrutiny.  Courts have been required to resolve the thorny constitutional attacks on state programs and procedures with limited precedential guidance.  In this case, appellees have challenged Georgia's procedural and substantive balance of the individual, family, and social interests at stake in the voluntary commitment of a child to one of its regional mental hospitals.\n\n\n47\nThe parties agree that our prior holdings have set out a general approach for testing challenged state procedures under a due process claim.  Assuming the existence of a protectible property or liberty interest, the Court has required a balancing of a number of factors:\n\n\n48\n\"First, the private interest that will be affected by the      official action;  second, the risk of an erroneous      deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and      the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards;  and finally, the Government's      interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and      administrative burdens that the additional or substitute      procedural requirement would entail.\"  Mathews v. Eldridge,      424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976),      quoted inSmith v. Organization of Foster Families, 431 U.S.      816, 848-849, 97 S.Ct. 2094, 2111-2112, 53 L.Ed.2d 14 (1977).\n\n\n49\nIn applying these criteria, we must consider first the child's interest in not being committed.  Normally, however, since this interest is inextricably linked with the parents' interest in and obligation for the welfare and health of the child, the private interest at stake is a combination of the child's and parents' concerns.11  Next, we must examine the State's interest in the procedures it has adopted for commitment and treatment of children.  Finally, we must consider how well Georgia's procedures protect against arbitrariness in the decision to commit a child to a state mental hospital.\n\n\n50\n(a) It is not disputed that a child, in common with adults, has a substantial liberty interest in not being confined unnecessarily for medical treatment and that the state's involvement in the commitment decision constitutes state action under the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 425, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 1809, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979);  In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 27, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1443, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967); Specht v. Patterson, 386 U.S. 605, 87 S.Ct. 1209, 18 L.Ed.2d 326 (1967).  We also recognize that commitment sometimes produces adverse social consequences for the child because of the reaction of some to the discovery that the child has received psychiatric care.  Cf. Addington v. Texas, supra, 441 U.S., at 425-426, 99 S.Ct., at 1809.\n\n\n51\nThis reaction, however, need not be equated with the community response resulting from being labeled by the state as delinquent, criminal, or mentally ill and possibly dangerous.  See ibid.;  In re Gault, supra, 387 U.S., at 23, 87 S.Ct., at 1441; Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 711-712, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 1165-1166, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976).  The state through its voluntary commitment procedures does not \"label\" the child;  it provides a diagnosis and treatment that medical specialists conclude the child requires.  In terms of public reaction, the child who exhibits abnormal behavior may be seriously injured by an erroneous decision not to commit.  Appellees overlook a significant source of the public reaction to the mentally ill, for what is truly \"stigmatizing\" is the symptomatology of a mental or emotional illness.   Addington v. Texas, supra, 441 U.S., at 429, 99 S.Ct., at 1811.  See also Schwartz, Myers, & Astrachan, Psychiatric Labeling and the Rehabilitation of the Mental Patient, 31 Archives of General Psychiatry 329 (1974).12  The pattern of untreated, abnormal behavior\u2014even if nondangerous\u2014arouses at least as much negative reaction as treatment that becomes public knowledge.  A person needing, but not receiving, appropriate medical care may well face even greater social ostracism resulting from the observable symptoms of an untreated disorder.13\n\n\n52\nHowever, we need not decide what effect these factors might have in a different case.  For purposes of this decision, we assume that a child has a protectible interest not only in being free of unnecessary bodily restraints but also in not being labeled erroneously by some persons because of an improper decision by the state hospital superintendent.\n\n\n53\n(b) We next deal with the interests of the parents who have decided, on the basis of their observations and independent professional recommendations, that their child needs institutional care.  Appellees argue that the constitutional rights of the child are of such magnitude and the likelihood of parental abuse is so great that the parents' traditional interests in and responsibility for the upbringing of their child must be subordinated at least to the extent of providing a formal adversary hearing prior to a voluntary commitment.\n\n\n54\nOur jurisprudence historically has reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as a unit with broad parental authority over minor children.  Our cases have consistently followed that course;  our constitutional system long ago rejected any notion that a child is \"the mere creature of the State\" and, on the contrary, asserted that parents generally \"have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare [their children] for additional obligations.\"  Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 535, 45 S.Ct. 571, 573, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925).  See also Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 213, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1532, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972);  Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166, 64 S.Ct. 438, 442, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944);  Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 400, 43 S.Ct. 625, 627, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923).  Surely, this includes a \"high duty\" to recognize symptoms of illness and to seek and follow medical advice.  The law's concept of the family rests on a presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment required for making life's difficult decisions.  More important, historically it has recognized that natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interests of their children.  1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries * 447;  2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law * 190.\n\n\n55\nAs with so many other legal presumptions, experience and reality may rebut what the law accepts as a starting point;  the incidence of child neglect and abuse cases attests to this.  That some parents \"may at times be acting against the interests of their children\" as was stated in Bartley v. Kremens, 402 F.Supp. 1039, 1047-1048 (ED Pa. 1975), vacated and remanded, 431 U.S. 119, 97 S.Ct. 1709, 52 L.Ed.2d 184 (1977), creates a basis for caution, but is hardly a reason to discard wholesale those pages of human experience that teach that parents generally do act in the child's best interests.  See Rolfe & MacClintock 348-349.  The statist notion that governmental power should supersede parental authority in all cases because some parents abuse and neglect children is repugnant to American tradition.\n\n\n56\nNonetheless, we have recognized that a state is not without constitutional control over parental discretion in dealing with children when their physical or mental health is jeopardized.  See Wisconsin v. Yoder, supra, 406 U.S., at 230, 92 S.Ct., at 1540; Prince v. Massachusetts, supra, 321 U.S., at 166, 64 S.Ct., at 442.  Moreover, the Court recently declared unconstitutional a state statute that granted parents an absolute veto over a minor child's decision to have an abortion.  Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976).  Appellees urge that these precedents limiting the traditional rights of parents, if viewed in the context of the liberty interest of the child and the likelihood of parental abuse, require us to hold that the parents' decision to have a child admitted to a mental hospital must be subjected to an exacting constitutional scrutiny, including a formal, adversary, pre-admission hearing.\n\n\n57\nAppellees' argument, however, sweeps too broadly.  Simply because the decision of a parent is not agreeable to a child or because it involves risks does not automatically transfer the power to make that decision from the parents to some agency or officer of the state.  The same characterizations can be made for a tonsillectomy, appendectomy, or other medical procedure.  Most children, even in adolescence, simply are not able to make sound judgments concerning many decisions, including their need for medical care or treatment.  Parents can and must make those judgments.  Here, there is no finding by the District Court of even a single instance of bad faith by any parent of any member of appellees' class.  We cannot assume that the result in Meyer v. Nebraska, supra, and Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra, would have been different if the children there had announced a preference to learn only English or a preference to go to a public, rather than a church, school.  The fact that a child may balk at hospitalization or complain about a parental refusal to provide cosmetic surgery does not diminish the parents' authority to decide what is best for the child.  See generally Goldstein, Medical Case for the Child at Risk:  On State Supervention of Parental Autonomy, 86 Yale L.J. 645, 664-668 (1977);  Bennett, Allocation of Child Medical Care Decisionmaking Authority:  A Suggested Interest Analysis, 62 Va.L.Rev. 285, 308 (1976).  Neither state officials nor federal courts are equipped to review such parental decisions.\n\n\n58\nAppellees place particular reliance on Planned Parenthood, arguing that its holding indicates how little deference to parents is appropriate when the child is exercising a constitutional right.  The basic situation in that case, however, was very different;  Planned Parenthood involved an absolute parental veto over the child's ability to obtain an abortion.  Parents in Georgia in no sense have an absolute right to commit their children to state mental hospitals;  the statute requires the superintendent of each regional hospital to exercise independent judgment as to the child's need for confinement.  See supra, at 591.\n\n\n59\nIn defining the respective rights and prerogatives of the child and parent in the voluntary commitment setting, we conclude that our precedents permit the parents to retain a substantial, if not the dominant, role in the decision, absent a finding of neglect or abuse, and that the traditional presumption that the parents act in the best interests of their child should apply.  We also conclude, however, that the child's rights and the nature of the commitment decision are such that parents cannot always have absolute and unreviewable discretion to decide whether to have a child institutionalized.  They, of course, retain plenary authority to seek such care for their children, subject to a physician's independent examination and medical judgment.\n\n\n60\n(c) The State obviously has a significant interest in confining the use of its costly mental health facilities to cases of genuine need.  The Georgia program seeks first to determine whether the patient seeking admission has an illness that calls for inpatient treatment.  To accomplish this purpose, the State has charged the superintendents of each regional hospital with the responsibility for determining, before authorizing an admission, whether a prospective patient is mentally ill and whether the patient will likely benefit from hospital care.  In addition, the State has imposed a continuing duty on hospital superintendents to release any patient who has recovered to the point where hospitalization is no longer needed.\n\n\n61\nThe State in performing its voluntarily assumed mission also has a significant interest in not imposing unnecessary procedural obstacles that may discourage the mentally ill or their families from seeking needed psychiatric assistance.  The parens patriae interest in helping parents care for the mental health of their children cannot be fulfilled if the parents are unwilling to take advantage of the opportunities because the admission process is too onerous, too embarrassing, or too contentious.  It is surely not idle to speculate as to how many parents who believe they are acting in good faith would forgo state-provided hospital care if such care is contingent on participation in an adversary proceeding designed to probe their motives and other private family matters in seeking the voluntary admission.\n\n\n62\nThe State also has a genuine interest in allocating priority to the diagnosis and treatment of patients as soon as they are admitted to a hospital rather than to time-consuming procedural minuets before the admission.14  One factor that must be considered is the utilization of the time of psychiatrists, psychologists, and other behavioral specialists in preparing for and participating in hearings rather than performing the task for which their special training has fitted them.  Behavioral experts in courtrooms and hearings are of little help to patients.\n\n\n63\nThe amici brief of the American Psychiatric Association et al. points out at page 20 that the average staff psychiatrist in a hospital presently is able to devote only 47% of his time to direct patient care.  One consequence of increasing the procedures the state must provide prior to a child's voluntary admission will be that mental health professionals will be diverted even more from the treatment of patients in order to travel to and participate in\u2014and wait for\u2014what could be hundreds\u2014or even thousands\u2014of hearings each year.  Obviously the cost of these procedures would come from the public moneys the legislature intended for mental health care.  See Slovenko 34-35.\n\n\n64\n(d) We now turn to consideration of what process protects adequately the child's constitutional rights by reducing risks of error without unduly trenching on traditional parental authority and without undercutting \"efforts to further the legitimate interests of both the state and the patient that are served by\" voluntary commitments.  Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S., at 430, 99 S.Ct., at 1811.  See also Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S., at 335, 96 S.Ct., at 903.  We conclude that the risk of error inherent in the parental decision to have a child institutionalized for mental health care is sufficiently great that some kind of inquiry should be made by a \"neutral factfinder\" to determine whether the statutory requirements for admission are satisfied.  See Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 271, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 1022, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970);  Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 489, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2604, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972).  That inquiry must carefully probe the child's background using all available sources, including, but not limited to, parents, schools, and other social agencies.  Of course, the review must also include an interview with the child.  It is necessary that the decisionmaker have the authority to refuse to admit any child who does not satisfy the medical standards for admission.  Finally, it is necessary that the child's continuing need for commitment be reviewed periodically by a similarly independent procedure.15\n\n\n65\nWe are satisfied that such procedures will protect the child from an erroneous admission decision in a way that neither unduly burdens the states nor inhibits parental decisions to seek state help.\n\n\n66\nDue process has never been thought to require that the neutral and detached trier of fact be law trained or a judicial or administrative officer.  SeeGoldberg v. Kelly, supra, 397 U.S., at 271, 90 S.Ct., at 1022;  Morrissey v. Brewer, supra, 408 U.S., at 489, 92 S.Ct., at 2604.  Surely, this is the case as to medical decisions, for \"neither judges nor administrative hearing officers are better qualified than psychiatrists to render psychiatric judgments.\"  In re Roger S., 19 Cal.3d 921, 942, 141 Cal.Rptr. 298, 311, 569 P.2d 1286, 1299 (1977) (Clark, J., dissenting). Thus, a staff physician will suffice, so long as he or she is free to evaluate independently the child's mental and emotional condition and need for treatment.\n\n\n67\nIt is not necessary that the deciding physician conduct a formal or quasi-formal, hearing.  A state is free to require such a hearing, but due process is not violated by use of informal traditional medical investigative techniques.  Since well-established medical procedures already exist, we do not undertake to outline with specificity precisely what this investigation must involve.  The mode and procedure of medical diagnostic procedures is not the business of judges.  What is best for a child is an individual medical decision that must be left to the judgment of physicians in each case.  We do no more than emphasize that the decision should represent an independent judgment of what the child requires and that all sources of information that are traditionally relied on by physicians and behavioral specialists should be consulted.\n\n\n68\nWhat process is constitutionally due cannot be divorced from the nature of the ultimate decision that is being made.  Not every determination by state officers can be made most effectively by use of \"the procedural tools of judicial or administrative decisionmaking.\"  Board of Curators of Univ. of Missouri v. Horowitz, 435 U.S. 78, 90, 98 S.Ct. 948, 955, 55 L.Ed.2d 124 (1978).  See also Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, 442 U.S. 1, 13-14, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 2106, 60 L.Ed.2d 668;  Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 895, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 1748, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230 (1961).16\n\n\n69\nHere, the questions are essentially medical in character: whether the child is mentally or emotionally ill and whether he can benefit from the treatment that is provided by the state. While facts are plainly necessary for a proper resolution of those questions, they are only a first step in the process.  In an opinion for a unanimous Court, we recently stated in Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S., at 429, 99 S.Ct., at 1811, that the determination of \"whether [a person] is mentally ill turns on the meaning of the facts which must be interpreted by expert psychiatrists and psychologists.\"\n\n\n70\nAlthough we acknowledge the fallibility of medical and psychiatric diagnosis, see O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 584, 95 S.Ct. 2486, 2498, 45 L.Ed.2d 396 (1975) (concurring opinion), we do not accept the notion that the shortcomings of specialists can always be avoided by shifting the decision from a trained specialist using the traditional tools of medical science to an untrained judge or administrative hearing officer after a judicial-type hearing.  Even after a hearing, the nonspecialist decisionmaker must make a medical-psychiatric decision.  Common human experience and scholarly opinions suggest that the supposed protections of an adversary proceeding to determine the appropriateness of medical decisions for the commitment and treatment of mental and emotional illness may well be more illusory than real.  See Albers, Pasewark, & Meyer, Involuntary Hospitalization and Psychiatric Testimony:  The Fallibility of the Doctrine of Immaculate Perception, 6 Cap.U.L.Rev. 11, 15 (1976).17\n\n\n71\nAnother problem with requiring a formalized, factfinding hearing lies in the danger it poses for significant intrusion into the parent-child relationship.  Pitting the parents and child as adversaries often will be at odds with the presumption that parents act in the best interests of their child.  It is one thing to require a neutral physician to make a careful review of the parents' decision in order to make sure it is proper from a medical standpoint;  it is a wholly different matter to employ an adversary contest to ascertain whether the parents' motivation is consistent with the child's interests.\n\n\n72\nMoreover, it is appropriate to inquire into how such a hearing would contribute to the successful long-range treatment of the patient.  Surely, there is a risk that it would exacerbate whatever tensions already exist between the child and the parents. Since the parents can and usually do play a significant role in the treatment while the child is hospitalized and even more so after release, there is a serious risk that an adversary confrontation will adversely affect the ability of the parents to assist the child while in the hospital.  Moreover, it will make his subsequent return home more difficult.  These unfortunate results are especially critical with an emotionally disturbed child;  they seem likely to occur in the context of an adversary hearing in which the parents testify.  A confrontation over such intimate family relationships would distress the normal adult parents and the impact on a disturbed child almost certainly would be significantly greater.18\n\n\n73\nIt has been suggested that a hearing conducted by someone other than the admitting physician is necessary in order to detect instances where parents are \"guilty of railroading their children into asylums\" or are using \"voluntary commitment procedures in order to sanction behavior of which they disapprov[e].\"  Ellis, Volunteering Children:  Parental Commitment of Minors to Mental Institutions, 62 Calif.L.Rev. 840, 850-851 (1974).  See also J. L. v. Parham, 412 F.Supp., at 133;  Brief for Appellees 38. Curiously, it seems to be taken for granted that parents who seek to \"dump\" their children on the state will inevitably be able to conceal their motives and thus deceive the admitting psychiatrists and the other mental health professionals who make and review the admission decision.  It is elementary that one early diagnostic inquiry into the cause of an emotional disturbance of a child is an examination into the environment of the child.  It is unlikely, if not inconceivable, that a decision to abandon an emotionally normal, healthy child and thrust him into an institution will be a discrete act leaving no trail of circumstances.  Evidence of such conflicts will emerge either in the interviews or from secondary sources.  It is unrealistic to believe that trained psychiatrists, skilled in eliciting responses, sorting medically relevant facts, and sensing motivational nuances will often be deceived about the family situation surrounding a child's emotional disturbance.19  Surely a lay, or even law-trained, factfinder would be no more skilled in this process than the professional.\n\n\n74\nBy expressing some confidence in the medical decisionmaking process, we are by no means suggesting it is error free.  On occasion, parents may initially mislead an admitting physician or a physician may erroneously diagnose the child as needing institutional care either because of negligence or an overabundance of caution.  That there may be risks of error in the process affords no rational predicate for holding unconstitutional an entire statutory and administrative scheme that is generally followed in more than 30 states.20  \"[P]rocedural due process rules are shaped by the risk of error inherent in the truthfinding process as applied to the generality of cases, not the rare exceptions.\"  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S., at 344, 96 S.Ct., at 907.  In general, we are satisfied that an independent medical decisionmaking process, which includes the thorough psychiatric investigation described earlier, followed by additional periodic review of a child's condition, will protect children who should not be admitted;  we do not believe the risks of error in that process would be significantly reduced by a more formal, judicial-type hearing.  The issue remains whether the Georgia practices, as described in the record before us, comport with these minimum due process requirements.\n\n\n75\n(e) Georgia's statute envisions a careful diagnostic medical inquiry to be conducted by the admitting physician at each regional hospital.  The amicus brief for the United States explains, at pages 7-8:\n\n\n76\n\"[I]n every instance the decision whether or not to accept      the child for treatment is made by a physician employed by      the State  . . ..\n\n\n77\n\"That decision is based on interviews and      recommendations by hospital or community health center staff.      The staff interviews the child and the parent or guardian who      brings the child to the facility  . . .  [and] attempts are made to communicate with other possible sources of      information about the child  . . ..\"\n\n\n78\nFocusing primarily on what it saw as the absence of any formal mechanism for review of the physician's initial decision, the District Court unaccountably saw the medical decision as an exercise of \"unbridled discretion.\"  412 F.Supp., at 136.  But extravagant characterizations are no substitute for careful analysis, and we must examine the Georgia process in its setting to determine if, indeed, any one person exercises such discretion.\n\n\n79\nIn the typical case, the parents of a child initially conclude from the child's behavior that there is some emotional problem\u2014in short, that \"something is wrong.\"  They may respond to the problem in various ways, but generally the first contact with the State occurs when they bring the child to be examined by a psychologist or psychiatrist at a community mental health clinic.\n\n\n80\nMost often, the examination is followed by outpatient treatment at the community clinic.  In addition, the child's parents are encouraged, and sometimes required, to participate in a family therapy program to obtain a better insight into the problem.  In most instances, this is all the care a child requires.  However, if, after a period of outpatient care, the child's abnormal emotional condition persists, he may be referred by the local clinic staff to an affiliated regional mental hospital.\n\n\n81\nAt the regional hospital an admissions team composed of a psychiatrist and at least one other mental health professional examines and interviews the child\u2014privately in most instances. This team then examines the medical records provided by the clinic staff and interviews the parents.  Based on this information, and any additional background that can be obtained, the admissions team makes a diagnosis and determines whether the child will likely benefit from institutionalized care.  If the team finds either condition not met, admission is refused.\n\n\n82\nIf the team admits a child as suited for hospitalization, the child's condition and continuing need for hospital care are reviewed periodically by at least one independent, medical review group.  For the most part, the reviews are as frequent as weekly, but none are less often than once every two months.  Moreover, as we noted earlier, the superintendent of each hospital is charged with an affirmative statutory duty to discharge any child who is no longer mentally ill or in need of therapy.21\n\n\n83\nAs with most medical procedures, Georgia's are not totally free from risk of error in the sense that they give total or absolute assurance that every child admitted to a hospital has a mental illness optimally suitable for institutionalized treatment. But it bears repeating that \"procedural due process rules are shaped by the risk of error inherent in the truth-finding process as applied to the generality of cases, not the rare exceptions.\" Mathews v. Eldridge, supra, 424 U.S., at 344, 96 S.Ct., at 907.\n\n\n84\nGeorgia's procedures are not \"arbitrary\" in the sense that a single physician or other professional has the \"unbridled discretion\" the District Court saw to commit a child to a regional hospital.  To so find on this record would require us to assume that the physicians, psychologists, and mental health professionals who participate in the admission decision and who review each other's conclusions as to the continuing validity of the initial decision are either oblivious or indifferent to the child's welfare\u2014or that they are incompetent.  We note, however, the District Court found to the contrary;  it was \"impressed by the conscientious, dedicated state employed psychiatrists who, with the help of equally conscientious, dedicated state employed psychologists and social workers, faithfully care for the plaintiff children  . . . .\"  412 F.Supp., at 138.\n\n\n85\nThis finding of the District Court also effectively rebuts the suggestion made in some of the briefs amici that hospital administrators may not actually be \"neutral and detached\" because of institutional pressure to admit a child who has no need for hospital care.  That such a practice may take place in some institutions in some places affords no basis for a finding as to Georgia's program;  the evidence in the record provides no support whatever for that charge against the staffs at any of the State's eight regional hospitals.  Such cases, if they are found, can be dealt with individually;22  they do not lend themselves to class-action remedies.\n\n\n86\nWe are satisfied that the voluminous record as a whole supports the conclusion that the admissions staffs of the hospitals have acted in a neutral and detached fashion in making medical judgments in the best interests of the children.  The State, through its mental health programs, provides the authority for trained professionals to assist parents in examining, diagnosing, and treating emotionally disturbed children.  Through its hiring practices, it provides well-staffed and well-equipped hospitals and\u2014as the District Court found\u2014conscientious public employees to implement the State's beneficent purposes.\n\n\n87\nAlthough our review of the record in this case satisfies us that Georgia's general administrative and statutory scheme for the voluntary commitment of children is not per se unconstitutional, we cannot decide on this record, whether every child in appellees' class received an adequate, independent diagnosis of his emotional condition and need for confinement under the standards announced earlier in this opinion.  On remand, the District Court is free to and should consider any individual claims that initial admissions did not meet the standards we have described in this opinion.\n\n\n88\nIn addition, we note that appellees' original complaint alleged that the State had failed to provide adequate periodic review of their need for institutional care and claimed that this was an additional due process violation.  Since the District Court held that the appellees' original confinement was unconstitutional, it had no reason to consider this separate claim.  Similarly, we have no basis for determining whether the review procedures of the various hospitals are adequate to provide the process called for or what process might be required if a child contests his confinement by requesting a release.  These matters require factual findings not present in the District Court's opinion.  We have held that the periodic reviews described in the record reduce the risk of error in the initial admission and thus they are necessary.  Whether they are sufficient to justify continuing a voluntary commitment is an issue for the District Court on remand.  The District Court is free to require additional evidence on this issue.\n\nIV\n\n89\n(a) Our discussion in Part III was directed at the situation where a child's natural parents request his admission to a state mental hospital.  Some members of appellees' class, including J. R., were wards of the State of Georgia at the time of their admission.  Obviously their situation differs from those members of the class who have natural parents.  While the determination of what process is due varies somewhat when the state, rather than a natural parent, makes the request for commitment, we conclude that the differences in the two situations do not justify requiring different procedures at the time of the child's initial admission to the hospital.\n\n\n90\nFor a ward of the state, there may well be no adult who knows him thoroughly and who cares for him deeply.  Unlike with natural parents where there is a presumed natural affection to guide their action, 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *447;  2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *190, the presumption that the state will protect a child's general welfare stems from a specific state statute.  Ga.Code \u00a7 24A-101 (1978).  Contrary to the suggestion of the dissent, however, we cannot assume that when the State of Georgia has custody of a child it acts so differently from a natural parent in seeking medical assistance for the child.  No one has questioned the validity of the statutory presumption that the State acts in the child's best interest.  Nor could such a challenge be mounted on the record before us.  There is no evidence that the State, acting as guardian, attempted to admit any child for reasons unrelated to the child's need for treatment. Indeed, neither the District Court nor the appellees have suggested that wards of the State should receive any constitutional treatment different from children with natural parents.\n\n\n91\nOnce we accept that the State's application for a child's admission to a hospital is made in good faith, then the question is whether the medical decisionmaking approach of the admitting physician is adequate to satisfy due process.  We have already recognized that an independent medical judgment made from the perspective of the best interests of the child after a careful investigation is an acceptable means of justifying a voluntary commitment.  We do not believe that the soundness of this decisionmaking is any the less reasonable in this setting.\n\n\n92\nIndeed, if anything, the decision with regard to wards of the State may well be even more reasonable in light of the extensive written records that are compiled about each child while in the State's custody.  In J. R.'s case, the admitting physician had a complete social and medical history of the child before even beginning the diagnosis.  After carefully interviewing him and reviewing his extensive files, three physicians independently concluded that institutional care was in his best interests.  See supra, at 590.\n\n\n93\nSince the state agency having custody and control of the child in loco parentis has a duty to consider the best interests of the child with respect to a decision on commitment to a mental hospital, the State may constitutionally allow that custodial agency to speak for the child, subject, of course, to the restrictions governing natural parents.  On this record, we cannot declare unconstitutional Georgia's admission procedures for wards of the State.\n\n\n94\n(b) It is possible that the procedures required in reviewing a ward's need for continuing care should be different from those used to review the need of a child with natural parents.  As we have suggested earlier, the issue of what process is due to justify continuing a voluntary commitment must be considered by the District Court on remand.  In making that inquiry, the District Court might well consider whether wards of the State should be treated with respect to continuing therapy differently from children with natural parents.\n\n\n95\nThe absence of an adult who cares deeply for a child has little effect on the reliability of the initial admission decision, but it may have some effect on how long a child will remain in the hospital.  We noted in Addington v. Texas, 141 U.S., at 428-429, 99 S.Ct., at 1811, that \"the concern of family and friends generally will provide continuous opportunities for an erroneous commitment to be corrected.\"  For a child without natural parents, we must acknowledge the risk of being \"lost in the shuffle.\"  Moreover, there is at least some indication that J. R.'s commitment was prolonged because the Department of Family and Children Services had difficulty finding a foster home for him.  Whether wards of the State generally have received less protection than children with natural parents, and, if so, what should be done about it, however, are matters that must be decided in the first instance by the District Court on remand,23 if the court concludes the issue is still alive.\n\nV\n\n96\nIt is important that we remember the purpose of Georgia's comprehensive mental health program.  It seeks substantively and at great cost to provide care for those who cannot afford to obtain private treatment and procedurally to screen carefully all applicants to assure that institutional care is suited to the particular patient.  The State resists the complex of procedures ordered by the District Court because in its view they are unnecessary to protect the child's rights, they divert public resources from the central objective of administering health care, they risk aggravating the tensions inherent in the family situation, and they erect barriers that may discourage parents from seeking medical aid for a disturbed child.\n\n\n97\nOn this record, we are satisfied that Georgia's medical factfinding processes are reasonable and consistent with constitutional guarantees.  Accordingly, it was error to hold unconstitutional the State's procedures for admitting a child for treatment to a state mental hospital.  The judgment is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n98\n\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n99\nMr. Justice STEWART, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n100\nFor centuries it has been a canon of the common law that parents speak for their minor children.1  So deeply imbedded in our traditions is this principle of law that the Constitution itself may compel a State to respect it.  Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042;  Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070.2  In ironic contrast, the District Court in this case has said that the Constitutionrequires the State of Georgia to disregard this established principle.  I cannot agree.\n\n\n101\nThere can be no doubt that commitment to a mental institution results in a \"massive curtailment of liberty,\" Humphrey v. Cady, 405 U.S. 504, 509, 92 S.Ct. 1048, 1052, 31 L.Ed.2d 394.  In addition to the physical confinement involved, O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 95 S.Ct. 2486, 45 L.Ed.2d 396, a person's liberty is also substantially affected by the stigma attached to treatment in a mental hospital.3  But not every loss of liberty is governmental deprivation of liberty, and it is only the latter that invokes the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n102\nThe appellees were committed under the following section of the Georgia Code:\n\n\n103\n\"Authority to receive voluntary patients\u2014\n\n\n104\n\"(a) The superintendent of any facility may receive for      observation and diagnosis any individual 18 years of age, or      older, making application therefor, any individual under 18      years of age for whom such application is made by his parent      or guardian and any person legally adjudged to be incompetent      for whom such application is made by his guardian.  If found      to show evidence of mental illness and to be suitable for      treatment, such person may be given care and treatment at      such facility and such person may be detained by such      facility for such period and under such conditions as may be      authorized by law.\"  Ga.Code \u00a7 88-503.1 (1975).\n\n\n105\nClearly, if the appellees in this case were adults who had voluntarily chosen to commit themselves to a state mental hospital, they could not claim that the State had thereby deprived them of liberty in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Just as clearly, I think, children on whose behalf their parents have invoked these voluntary procedures can make no such claim.\n\n\n106\nThe Georgia statute recognizes the power of a party to act on behalf of another person under the voluntary commitment procedures in two situations:  when the other person is a minor not over 17 years of age and the party is that person's parent or guardian, and when the other person has been \"legally adjudged incompetent\" and the party is that person's guardian.  In both instances two conditions are present.  First, the person being committed is presumptively incapable of making the voluntary commitment decision for himself.  And second, the parent or guardian is presumed to be acting in that person's best interests.4  In the case of guardians, these presumptions are grounded in statutes whose validity nobody has questioned in this case.  Ga.Code \u00a7 49-201 (1978).5  In the case of parents, the presumptions are grounded in a statutory embodiment of long-established principles of the common law.\n\n\n107\nThus, the basic question in this case is whether the Constitution requires Georgia to ignore basic principles so long accepted by our society.  For only if the State in this setting is constitutionally compelled always to intervene between parent and child can there be any question as to the constitutionally required extent of that intervention.  I believe this basic question must be answered in the negative.6\n\n\n108\nUnder our law, parents constantly make decisions for their minor children that deprive the children of liberty, and sometimes even of life itself.  Yet surely the Fourteenth Amendment is not invoked when an informed parent decides upon major surgery for his child, even in a state hospital.  I can perceive no basic constitutional differences between commitment to a mental hospital and other parental decisions that result in a child's loss of liberty.\n\n\n109\nI realize, of course, that a parent's decision to commit his child to a state mental institution results in a far greater loss of liberty than does his decision to have an appendectomy performed upon the child in a state hospital.  But if, contrary to my belief, this factual difference rises to the level of a constitutional difference, then I believe that the objective checks upon the parents' commitment decision, embodied in Georgia law and thoroughly discussed, ante, at 613-617, are more than constitutionally sufficient.\n\n\n110\nTo be sure, the presumption that a parent is acting in the best interests of his child must be a rebuttable one, since certainly not all parents are actuated by the unselfish motive the law presumes.  Some parents are simply unfit parents.  But Georgia clearly provides that an unfit parent can be stripped of his parental authority under laws dealing with neglect and abuse of children.7\n\n\n111\nThis is not an easy case.  Issues involving the family and issues concerning mental illness are among the most difficult that courts have to face, involving as they often do serious problems of policy disguised as questions of constitutional law.  But when a state legislature makes a reasonable definition of the age of minority, and creates a rebuttable presumption that in invoking the statutory procedures for voluntary commitment a parent is acting in the best interests of his minor child, I cannot believe that the Fourteenth Amendment is violated.  This is not to say that in this area the Constitution compels a State to respect the traditional authority of a parent, as in the Meyer and Pierce cases.  I believe, as in Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645, that the Constitution would tolerate intervention by the State.8  But that is a far cry from holding that such intervention is constitutionally compelled.\n\n\n112\nFor these reasons I concur in the judgment.\n\n\n113\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL and Mr. Justice STEVENS join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\n114\nI agree with the Court that the commitment of juveniles to state mental hospitals by their parents or by state officials acting in loco parentis involves state action that impacts upon constitutionally protected interests and therefore must be accomplished through procedures consistent with the constitutional mandate of due process of law.  I agree also that the District Court erred in interpreting the Due Process clause to require preconfinement commitment hearings in all cases in which parents wish to hospitalize their children.  I disagree, however, with the Court's decision to pretermit questions concerning the postadmission procedures due Georgia's institutionalized juveniles.  While the question of the frequency of postadmission review hearings may properly be deferred, the right to at least one postadmission hearing can and should be affirmed now.  I also disagree with the Court's conclusion concerning the procedures due juvenile wards of the State of Georgia.  I believe that the Georgia statute is unconstitutional in that it fails to accord preconfinement hearings to juvenile wards of the State committed by the State acting in loco parentis.\n\n\n115\n* Rights of Children Committed to Mental Institutions\n\n\n116\nCommitment to a mental institution necessarily entails a \"massive curtailment of liberty,\" Humphrey v. Cady, 405 U.S. 504, 509, 92 S.Ct. 1048, 1052, 31 L.Ed.2d 394 (1972), and inevitably affects \"fundamental rights.\"  Baxstrom v. Herold, 383 U.S. 107, 113, 86 S.Ct. 760, 764, 15 L.Ed.2d 620 (1966).  Persons incarcerated in mental hospitals are not only deprived of their physical liberty, they are also deprived of friends, family, and community.  Institutionalized mental patients must live in unnatural surroundings under the continuous and detailed control of strangers.  They are subject to intrusive treatment which, especially if unwarranted, may violate their right to bodily integrity.  Such treatment modalities may include forced administration of psychotropic medication1 aversive conditioning,2 convulsive therapy,3 and even psychosurgery.4 Furthermore, as the Court recognizes, see ante, at 600, persons confined in mental institutions are stigmatized as sick and abnormal during confinement and, in some cases, even after release.5\n\n\n117\nBecause of these considerations, our cases have made clear that commitment to a mental hospital \"is a deprivation of liberty which the State cannot accomplish without due process of law.\" O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 580, 95 S.Ct. 2486, 2496, 45 L.Ed.2d 396 (1975) (BURGER, C. J., concurring).  See, e. g., McNeil v. Director, Patuxent Institution, 407 U.S. 245, 92 S.Ct. 2083, 32 L.Ed.2d 719 (1972) (defective delinquent commitment following expiration of prison term);  Specht v. Patterson, 386 U.S. 605, 87 S.Ct. 1209, 18 L.Ed.2d 326 (1967) (sex offender commitment following criminal conviction);  Chaloner v. Sherman, 242 U.S. 455, 461, 37 S.Ct. 136, 137, 61 L.Ed. 427 (1917) (incompetence inquiry).  In the absence of a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver, adults facing commitment to mental institutions are entitled to full and fair adversary hearings in which the necessity for their commitment is established to the satisfaction of a neutral tribunal.  At such hearings they must be accorded the right to \"be present with counsel, have an opportunity to be heard, be confronted with witnesses against [them], have the right to cross-examine, and to offer evidence of [their] own.\"  Specht v. Patterson, supra, at 610, 87 S.Ct., at 1212.\n\n\n118\nThese principles also govern the commitment of children. \"Constitutional rights do not mature and come into being magically only when one attains the state-defined age of majority.  Minors as well as adults are protected by the Constitution and possess constitutional rights.  See, e. g., Breed v. Jones, 421 U.S. 519, 95 S.Ct. 1779, 44 L.Ed.2d 346 (1975);  Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975);  Tinker v. Des Moines School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969); In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967).\" Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 74, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 2843, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976).\n\n\n119\nIndeed, it may well be argued that children are entitled to more protection than are adults.  The consequences of an erroneous commitment decision are more tragic where children are involved.  Children, on the average, are confined for longer periods than are adults.6  Moreover, childhood is a particularly vulnerable time of life7 and children erroneously institutionalized during their formative years may bear the scars for the rest of their lives.8  Furthermore, the provision of satisfactory institutionalized mental care for children generally requires a substantial financial commitment9 that too often has not been forthcoming.10  Decisions of the lower courts have chronicled the inadequacies of existing mental health facilities for children.  See, e. g., New York State Assn. for Retarded Children v. Rockefeller, 357 F.Supp. 752, 756 (EDNY 1973) (conditions at Willowbrook School for the Mentally Retarded are \"inhumane,\" involving \"failure to protect the physical safety of [the] children,\" substantial personnel shortage, and \"poor\" and \"hazardous\" conditions);  Wyatt v. Stickney, 344 F.Supp. 387, 391 (MD Ala.1972), aff'd sub nom. Wyatt v. Aderholt, 503 F.2d 1305 (CA5 1974) (\"grossly substandard\" conditions at Partlow School for the Mentally Retarded lead to \"hazardous and deplorable inadequacies in the institution's operation.\").11\n\n\n120\nIn addition, the chances of an erroneous commitment decision are particularly great where children are involved.  Even under the best of circumstances psychiatric diagnosis and therapy decisions are fraught with uncertainties.  See O'Connor v. Donaldson, supra, 422 U.S., at 584, 95 S.Ct., at 2498 (BURGER, C. J., concurring).  These uncertainties are aggravated when, as under the Georgia practice, the psychiatrist interviews the child during a period of abnormal stress in connection with the commitment, and without adequate time or opportunity to become acquainted with the patient.12  These uncertainties may be further aggravated when economic and social class separate doctor and child, thereby frustrating the accurate diagnosis of pathology.13\n\n\n121\nThese compounded uncertainties often lead to erroneous commitments since psychiatrists tend to err on the side of medical caution and therefore hospitalize patients for whom other dispositions would be more beneficial.14  The National Institute of Mental Health recently found that only 36% of patients below age 20 who were confined at St. Elizabeths Hospital actually required such hospitalization.15  Of particular relevance to this case, a Georgia study Commission on Mental Health Services for Children and Youth concluded that more than half of the State's institutionalized children were not in need of confinement if other forms of care were made available or used.  Cited in J. L. v. Parham, 412 F.Supp. 112, 122 (MD Ga.1976).\n\nII\n\n122\nRights of Children Committed by Their Parents\n\nA.\n\n123\nNotwithstanding all this, Georgia denies hearings to juveniles institutionalized at the behest of their parents. Georgia rationalizes this practice on the theory that parents act in their children's best interests and therefore may waive their children's due process rights.  Children incarcerated because their parents wish them confined, Georgia contends, are really voluntary patients.  I cannot accept this argument.\n\n\n124\nIn our society, parental rights are limited by the legitimate rights and interests of their children.  \"Parents may be free to be become martyrs themselves.  But it does not follow they are free, in identical circumstances, to make martyrs of their children before they have reached the age of full and legal discretion when they can make that choice for themselves.\"  Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 170, 64 S.Ct. 438, 444, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944).  This principle is reflected in the variety of statutes and cases that authorize state intervention on behalf of neglected or abused children16 and that, inter alia, curtail parental authority to alienate their children's property,17 to withhold necessary medical treatment,18 and to deny children exposure to ideas and experiences they may later need as independent and autonomous adults.19\n\n\n125\nThis principle is also reflected in constitutional jurisprudence.  Notions of parental authority and family autonomy cannot stand as absolute and invariable barriers to the assertion of constitutional rights by children.  States, for example, may not condition a minor's right to secure an abortion on attaining her parents' consent since the right to an abortion is an important personal right and since disputes between parents and children on this question would fracture family autonomy.  See Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S., at 75, 96 S.Ct., at 2844.\n\n\n126\nThis case is governed by the rule of Danforth.  The right to be free from wrongful incarceration, physical intrusion, and stigmatization has significance for the individual surely as great as the right to an abortion.  Moreover, as in Danforth, the parent-child dispute at issue here cannot be characterized as involving only a routine child-rearing decision made within the context of an ongoing family relationship.  Indeed, Danforth involved only a potential dispute between parent and child, whereas here a break in family autonomy has actually resulted in the parents' decision to surrender custody of their child to a state mental institution.  In my view, a child who has been ousted from his family has even greater need for an independent advocate.\n\n\n127\nAdditional considerations counsel against allowing parents unfettered power to institutionalize their children without cause or without any hearing to ascertain that cause.  The presumption that parents act in their children's best interests, while applicable to most child-rearing decisions, is not applicable in the commitment context.  Numerous studies reveal that parental decisions to institutionalize their children often are the results of dislocation in the family unrelated to the children's mental condition.20  Moreover, even well-meaning parents lack the expertise necessary to evaluate the relative advantages and disadvantages of inpatient as opposed to outpatient psychiatric treatment.  Parental decisions to waive hearings in which such questions could be explored, therefore, cannot be conclusively deemed either informed or intelligent.  In these circumstances, I respectfully suggest, it ignores reality to assume blindly that parents act in their children's best interests when making commitment decisions and when waiving their children's due process rights.\n\nB\n\n128\nThis does not mean States are obliged to treat children who are committed at the behest of their parents in precisely the same manner as other persons who are involuntarily committed.  The demands of due process are flexible and the parental commitment decision carries with it practical implications that States may legitimately take into account.  While as a general rule due process requires that commitment hearings precede involuntary hospitalization, when parents seek to hospitalize their children special considerations militate in favor of postponement of formal commitment proceedings and against mandatory adversary preconfinement commitment hearings.\n\n\n129\nFirst, the prospect of an adversary hearing prior to admission might deter parents from seeking needed medical attention for their children.  Second, the hearings themselves might delay treatment of children whose home life has become impossible and who require some form of immediate state care. Furthermore, because adversary hearings at this juncture would necessarily involve direct challenges to parental authority, judgment, or veracity, preadmission hearings may well result in pitting the child and his advocate against the parents.  This, in turn, might traumatize both parent and child and make the child's eventual return to his family more difficult.\n\n\n130\nBecause of these special considerations, I believe that States may legitimately postpone formal commitment proceedings when parents seek inpatient psychiatric treatment for their children.  Such children may be admitted, for a limited period, without prior hearing, so long as the admitting psychiatrist first interviews parent and child and concludes that short-term inpatient treatment would be appropriate.\n\n\n131\nGeorgia's present admission procedures are reasonably consistent with these principles.  See ante, at 613-616.  To the extent the District Court invalidated this aspect of the Georgia juvenile commitment scheme and mandated preconfinement hearings in all cases, I agree with the Court that the District Court was in error.\n\nC\n\n132\nI do not believe, however, that the present Georgia juvenile commitment scheme is constitutional in its entirety.  Although Georgia may postpone formal commitment hearings, when parents seek to commit their children, the State cannot dispense with such hearings altogether.  Our cases make clear that, when protected interests are at stake, the \"fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard 'at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.' \"  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333, 96 S.Ct. 893, 902, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), quoting in part from Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 1191, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965).  Whenever prior hearings are impracticable, States must provide reasonably prompt postdeprivation hearings.  Compare North Georgia Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., 419 U.S. 601, 95 S.Ct. 719, 42 L.Ed.2d 751 (1975), with Mitchell v. W. T. Grant Co., 416 U.S. 600, 94 S.Ct. 1895, 40 L.Ed.2d 406 (1974).\n\n\n133\nThe informal postadmission procedures that Georgia now follows are simply not enough to qualify as hearings\u2014let alone reasonably prompt hearings.  The procedures lack all the traditional due process safeguards.  Commitment decisions are made ex parte.  Georgia's institutionalized juveniles are not informed of the reasons for their commitment;  nor do they enjoy the right to be present at the commitment determination, the right to representation, the right to be heard, the right to be confronted with adverse witnesses, the right to cross-examine, or the right to offer evidence of their own.  By any standard of due process, these procedures are deficient.  See Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974);  Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972);  McNeil v. Director, Patuxent Institution, 407 U.S. 245, 92 S.Ct. 2083, 32 L.Ed.2d 719 (1972);  Specht v. Patterson, 386 U.S., at 610, 87 S.Ct., at 1212.  See also Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 269-271, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 1021-1022, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970).  I cannot understand why the Court pretermits condemnation of these ex parte procedures which operate to deny Georgia's institutionalized juveniles even \"some form of hearing,\" Mathews v. Eldridge, supra, 424 U.S., at 333, 96 S.Ct., at 902, before they are condemned to suffer the rigors of long-term institutional confinement.21\n\n\n134\nThe special considerations that militate against preadmission commitment hearings when parents seek to hospitalize their children do not militate against reasonably prompt postadmission commitment hearings.  In the first place, postadmission hearings would not delay the commencement of needed treatment.  Children could be cared for by the State pending the disposition decision.\n\n\n135\nSecond, the interest in avoiding family discord would be less significant at this stage since the family autonomy already will have been fractured by the institutionalization of the child.  In any event, postadmission hearings are unlikely to disrupt family relationships.  At later hearings, the case for and against commitment would be based upon the observations of the hospital staff and the judgments of the staff psychiatrists, rather than upon parental observations and recommendations.  The doctors urging commitment, and not the parents, would stand as the child's adversaries.  As a consequence, postadmission commitment hearings are unlikely to involve direct challenges to parental authority, judgment, or veracity.  To defend the child, the child's advocate need not dispute the parents' original decision to seek medical treatment for their child, or even, for that matter, their observations concerning the child's behavior.  The advocate need only argue, for example, that the child had sufficiently improved during his hospital stay to warrant outpatient treatment or outright discharge.  Conflict between doctor and advocate on this question is unlikely to lead to family discord.\n\n\n136\nAs a consequence, the prospect of a postadmission hearing is unlikely to deter parents from seeking medical attention for their children and the hearing itself is unlikely so to traumatize parent and child as to make the child's eventual return to the family impracticable.\n\n\n137\nNor would postadmission hearings defeat the primary purpose of the state juvenile mental health enterprise.  Under the present juvenile commitment scheme, Georgia parents do not enjoy absolute discretion to commit their children to public mental hospitals.  See ante, at 614-615. Superintendents of state facilities may not accept children for long-term treatment unless they first determine that the children are mentally ill and will likely benefit from long-term hospital care.  See ibid.  If the superintendent determines either condition is unmet, the child must be released or refused admission, regardless of the parents' desires.  See ibid.  No legitimate state interest would suffer if the superintendent's determinations were reached through fair proceedings with due consideration of fairly presented opposing viewpoints rather than through the present practice of secret, ex parte deliberations.22\n\n\n138\nNor can the good faith and good intentions of Georgia's psychiatrists and social workers, adverted to by the Court, see ante, at 615-616, excuse Georgia's ex parte procedures. Georgia's admitting psychiatrists, like the school disciplinarians described in Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975), \"although proceeding in utmost good faith, frequently act on the reports and advice of others;  and the controlling facts and the nature of the conduct under challenge are often disputed.\"  Id., at 580, 95 S.Ct., at 739.  See App. 188-190, testimony of Dr. Messinger.  Here, as in Goss, the \"risk of error is not at all trivial, and it should be guarded against if that may be done without prohibitive cost or interference with the  . . .  process.  '[F]airness can rarely be obtained by secret, one-sided determination of facts decisive of rights.  . . .'  'Secrecy is not congenial to truth-seeking and self-righteousness gives too slender an assurance of rightness.  No better instrument has been devised for arriving at truth than to give a person in jeopardy of serious loss notice of the case against him and opportunity to meet it.' \" Goss v. Lopez, supra, at 580, 95 S.Ct., at 739, quoting in part from Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 170, 171-172, 71 S.Ct. 624, 647-648, 649, 95 L.Ed. 817 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).\n\nIII\n\n139\nRights of Children Committed by Their State Guardians\n\n\n140\nGeorgia does not accord prior hearings to juvenile wards of the State of Georgia committed by state social workers acting in loco parentis.  The Court dismisses a challenge to this practice on the grounds that state social workers are obliged by statute to act in the children's best interest.  See ante, at 619.\n\n\n141\nI find this reasoning particularly unpersuasive.  With equal logic, it could be argued that criminal trials are unnecessary since prosecutors are not supposed to prosecute innocent persons.\n\n\n142\nTo my mind, there is no justification for denying children committed by their social workers the prior hearings that the Constitution typically requires.  In the first place, such children cannot be said to have waived their rights to a prior hearing simply because their social workers wished them to be confined.  The rule that parents speak for their children, even if it were applicable in the commitment context, cannot be transmuted into a rule that state social workers speak for their minor clients.  The rule in favor of deference to parental authority is designed to shield parental control of child rearing from state interference.  See Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 535, 45 S.Ct. 571, 573, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925).  The rule cannot be invoked in defense of unfettered state control of child rearing or to immunize from review the decisions of state social workers.  The social worker-child relationship is not deserving of the special protection and deference accorded to the parent-child relationship, and state officials acting in loco parentis cannot be equated with parents.  See O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 95 S.Ct. 2486, 45 L.Ed.2d 396 (1975);  Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972).\n\n\n143\nSecond, the special considerations that justify postponement of formal commitment proceedings whenever parents seek to hospitalize their children are absent when the children are wards of the State and are being committed upon the recommendations of their social workers.  The prospect of preadmission hearings is not likely to deter state social workers from discharging their duties and securing psychiatric attention for their disturbed clients.  Moreover, since the children will already be in some form of state custody as wards of the State, prehospitalization hearings will not prevent needy children from receiving state care during the pendency of the commitment proceedings.  Finally, hearings in which the decisions of state social workers are reviewed by other state officials are not likely to traumatize the children or to hinder their eventual recovery.\n\n\n144\nFor these reasons, I believe that, in the absence of exigent circumstances, juveniles committed upon the recommendation of their social workers are entitled to preadmission commitment hearings.  As a consequence, I would hold Georgia's present practice of denying these juveniles prior hearings unconstitutional.\n\nIV\n\n145\nChildren incarcerated in public mental institutions are constitutionally entitled to a fair opportunity to contest the legitimacy of their confinement.  They are entitled to some champion who can speak on their behalf and who stands ready to oppose a wrongful commitment.  Georgia should not be permitted to deny that opportunity and that champion simply because the children's parents or guardians wish them to be confined without a hearing.  The risk of erroneous commitment is simply too great unless there is some form of adversary review.  And fairness demands that children abandoned by their supposed protectors to the rigors of institutional confinement be given the help of some separate voice.\n\n\n\n1\n Pending our review, one of the named plaintiffs before the District Court, J. L., died.  Although the individual claim of J. L. is moot, we discuss the facts of this claim because, in part, they form the basis for the District Court's holding.\n\n\n2\n The class certified by the District Court, without objection by appellants, consisted \"of all persons younger than 18 years of age now or hereafter received by any defendant for observation and diagnosis and\/or detained for care and treatment at any 'facility' within the State of Georgia pursuant to\" Ga.Code \u00a7 88-503.1 (1975).  Although one witness testified that on any given day there may be 200 children in the class, in December 1975 there were only 140.\n\n\n3\n Section 88-503.1 provides:\n\"The superintendent of any facility may receive for observation and diagnosis  . . .  any individual under 18 years of age for whom such application is made by his parent or guardian  . . . .  If found to show evidence of mental illness and to be suitable for treatment, such person may be given care and treatment at such facility and such person may be detained by such facility for such period and under such conditions as may be authorized by law.\"\nSection 88-503.2 provides:\n\"The superintendent of the facility shall discharge any voluntary patient who has recovered from his mental illness or who has sufficiently improved that the superintendent determines that hospitalization of the patient is no longer desirable.\"\nSection 88-503 was amended in some respects in 1978, but references herein are to the provisions in effect at the time in question.\n\n\n4\n Although the State has eight regional hospitals, superintendents from only seven of them were deposed.  In addition, the District Court referred to only seven hospitals in its list of members of the plaintiff class.  Apparently, the eighth hospital, Northwest Regional in Rome, Ga., had no children being treated there.  The District Court's order was issued against the State Commissioner of the Department of Human Resources, who is responsible for the activities of all eight hospitals, including Northwest Regional.\n\n\n5\n The source for these data is National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, State Report:  State Mental Health Agency Expenditures (Aug. 1, 1978).\n\n\n6\n The record is very sparse with regard to the physical facilities and daily routines at the various regional hospitals. The only hospital discussed by appellees' expert witness was Central State.  The District Court visited Central State and one other hospital, but did not discuss the visits in its opinion.\n\n\n7\n In both respects, the District Court found strong support for its holding in this Court's decision in In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967).  In that decision, we held that a state cannot institutionalize a juvenile delinquent without first providing certain due process protections.\n\n\n8\n In light of the District Court's holding that a judicial or quasi-judicial body should review voluntary commitment decisions, it is at least interesting to note that the witness who made the statement quoted in the text was not referring to parents as the people who \"dump\" children into hospitals.  This witness opined that some juvenile court judges and child welfare agencies misused the hospitals.  App. 768.  See also Rolfe & MacClintock, The Due Process Rights of Minors \"Voluntarily Admitted\" to Mental Institutions, 4 J. Psychiatry & L. 333, 351 (1976) (hereinafter Rolfe & MacClintock).\n\n\n9\n This study was conducted by the Study Commission on Mental Health Services for Children and Youth and was financed by the State of Georgia.  The Commission was made up of eight distinguished scholars in the field of mental health.  They spent six months studying the five regional hospitals that were in existence at that time.\n\n\n10\n See, e. g., Community Health Centers Act, 77 Stat. 290, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2689 et seq.\n\n\n11\n In this part of the opinion, we will deal with the issues arising when the natural parents of the child seek commitment to a state hospital.  In Part IV, we will deal with the situation presented when the child is a ward of the state.\n\n\n12\n See also Gove & Fain, The Stigma of Mental Hospitalization, 28 Archives of General Psychiatry 494, 500 (1973);  Phillips, Rejection of the Mentally Ill:  The Influence of Behavior and Sex, 29 Am.Sociological Rev. 679, 686-687 (1964). Research by Schwartz, Myers, and Astrachan and that of Gove and Fain found \"that the stigma of mental hospitalization is not a major problem for the ex-patient.\"  Schwartz, Myers, & Astrachan, Psychiatric Labeling and the Rehabilitation of the Mental Patient, 31 Archives of General Psychiatry 329, 333 (1974).\n\n\n13\n As Schwartz, Myers, and Astrachan concluded:\n\"Discharge [from a mental hospital] before disturbed behavior is well controlled may advance the patient into an inhospitable world that can incubate the chronicity that was to be avoided in the first place.\"   Id., at 334.\n\n\n14\n Judge Friendly has cogently pointed out:\n\"It should be realized that procedural requirements entail the expenditure of limited resources, that at some point the benefit to individuals from an additional safeguard is substantially outweighed by the cost of providing such protection, and that the expense of protecting those likely to be found undeserving will probably come out of the pockets of the deserving.\"  Friendly, \"Some Kind of Hearing,\" 123 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1267, 1276 (1975).  See also Wheeler v. Montgomery, 397 U.S. 280, 282, 90 S.Ct. 1026, 1027, 25 L.Ed.2d 307 (1970) (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n15\n As we discuss more fully later, infra, at 617, the District Court did not decide and we therefore have no reason to consider at this time what procedures for review are independently necessary to justify continuing a child's confinement.  We merely hold that a subsequent, independent review of the patient's condition provides a necessary check against possible arbitrariness in the initial admission decision.\n\n\n16\n Relying on general statements from past decisions dealing with governmental actions not even remotely similar to those involved here, the dissent concludes that if a protectible interest is involved then there must be some form of traditional, adversary, judicial, or administrative hearing either before or after its deprivation.  That result is mandated, in their view, regardless of what process the state has designed to protect the individual and regardless of what the record demonstrates as to the fairness of the state's approach.\nThe dissenting approach is inconsistent with our repeated assertion that \"due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\" Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) (emphasis added).  Just as there is no requirement as to exactly what procedures to employ whenever a traditional judicial-type hearing is mandated, compare Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975);  Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974); Morrissey v. Brewer, supra, with Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970), there is no reason to require a judicial-type hearing in all circumstances.  As the scope of governmental action expands into new areas creating new controversies for judicial review, it is incumbent on courts to design procedures that protect the rights of the individual without unduly burdening the legitimate efforts of the states to deal with difficult social problems.  The judicial model for factfinding for all constitutionally protected interests, regardless of their nature, can turn rational decisionmaking into an unmanageable enterprise.\n\n\n17\n See Albers & Pasewark, Involuntary Hospitalization: Surrender at the Courthouse, 2 Am.J.Community Psychology 287, 288 (1974) (mean hearing time for 21 of 300 consecutive commitment cases was 9.2 minutes);  Miller & Schwartz, County Lunacy Commission Hearings:  Some Observations of Commitments to a State Mental Hospital, 14 Social Prob. 26 (1966) (mean time for hearings was 3.8 minutes);  Scheff, The Societal Reaction to Deviance: Ascriptive Elements in the Psychiatric Screening of Mental Patients in a Midwestern State, 11 Social Prob. 401 (1964) (average hearing lasted 9.2 minutes).  See also Cohen, The Function of the Attorney and the Commitment of the Mentally Ill, 44 Texas L.Rev. 424 (1966).\n\n\n18\n While not altogether clear, the District Court opinion apparently contemplated a hearing preceded by a written notice of the proposed commitment.  At the hearing the child presumably would be given an opportunity to be heard and present evidence, and the right to cross-examine witnesses, including, of course, the parents.  The court also required an impartial trier of fact who would render a written decision reciting the reasons for accepting or rejecting the parental application.\nSince the parents in this situation are seeking the child's admission to the state institution, the procedure contemplated by the District Court presumably would call for some other person to be designated as a guardian ad litem to act for the child.  The guardian, in turn, if not a lawyer, would be empowered to retain counsel to act as an advocate of the child's interest.\nOf course, a state may elect to provide such adversary hearings in situations where it perceives that parents and a child may be at odds, but nothing in the Constitution compels such procedures.\n\n\n19\n In evaluating the problem of detecting \"dumping\" by parents, it is important to keep in mind that each of the regional hospitals has a continuing relationship with the Department of Family and Children Services.  The staffs at those hospitals refer cases to the Department when they suspect a child is being mistreated and thus are sensitive to this problem.  In fact, J. L.'s situation is in point.  The family conflicts and problems were well documented in the hospital records.  Equally well documented, however, were the child's severe emotional disturbances and his need for treatment.\n\n\n20\n Alaska Stat.Ann. \u00a7 47.30.020 (1975);  Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 36-518, 36-519 (1974);  Ark.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 59-405 (B) (1971); Cal.Welf. & Inst.Code Ann. \u00a7 6000 (West Supp.1979);  D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 21-511, 21-512 (1973);  Fla.Stat. \u00a7 394.465(1)(a) (Supp.1979); Ga.Code \u00a7\u00a7 88-503.1, 88-503.2 (1978);  Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 334-60(a)(2) (1976) (only for child less than 15);  Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 66-318, 66-320 (Supp.1978) (parent may admit child under 14, but child over 16 may obtain release);  Ill.Rev.Stat., ch. 911\/2, \u00a7\u00a7 3-502, 3-503 (Supp.1978);  Ind.Code \u00a7 16-14-9.1-2 (1976); Kan.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 59-2905, 59-2907 (Supp.1978);  Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 202A.020 (1977);  La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 28:57(C) (West Supp.1979); Md.Ann.Code, Art. 59, \u00a7 11(g) (Supp.1978) (parental consent permissible only to some facilities);  Mass.Gen.Laws Ann., ch. 123, \u00a7 10(a) (West Supp.1979);  Mich.Comp.Laws \u00a7 330.1415 (1976) (child may object within 30 days and receive a hearing); Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 41-21-103(1) (Supp.1978) (certificate of need for treatment from two physicians required);  Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 202.115(1)(2), 202.115(2)(2) (1978);  Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 422A.560, 433A.540 (1975);  N.Y.

As the appellants' brief explains, \"Ga.Code \u00a7 88-502.11  . . .  provides that at any time and without notice a person detained in a facility, or a relative or friend of such person, may petition for a writ of habeas corpus to question the cause and legality of the detention of the person.\"  Brief for Appellants 36-37.\n\n\n23\n To remedy the constitutional violation, the District Court ordered hearings to be held for each member of the plaintiff class, see n. 2, supra.  For 46 members of the class found to be treatable in \"less drastic\" settings, the District Court also ordered the State to expend such moneys as were necessary to provide alternative treatment facilities and programs.  While the order is more appropriate as a remedy for a substantive due process violation, the court made no findings on that issue.  The order apparently was intended to remedy the procedural due process violation it found.  Since that judgment is reversed, there is no basis for us to consider the correctness of the remedy.\n\n\n1\n See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *452-453;  2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *203-206;  J. Schouler, A Treatise on the Law of Domestic Relations 335-353 (3d ed. 1882);  G. Field, The Legal Relations of Infants 63-80 (1888).\n\"It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.\"   Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166, 64 S.Ct. 438, 442, 88 L.Ed. 645.\n\"The history and culture of Western civilization reflect a strong tradition of parental concern for the nurture and upbringing of their children.  This primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition.\"  Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, at 232, 92 S.Ct., 1526, at 1542, 32 L.Ed.2d 15.\n\"Because he may not foresee the consequences of his decision, a minor may not make an enforceable bargain.  He may not lawfully work or travel where he pleases, or even attend exhibitions of constitutionally protected adult motion pictures. Persons below a certain age may not marry without parental consent.\"  Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 102, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 2856, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nCf. Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 366, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 1109-1110, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n2\n \"The child is not the mere creature of the State;  those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.\"  Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S., at 535, 45 S.Ct., at 573.\n\n\n3\n The fact that such a stigma may be unjustified does not mean it does not exist.  Nor does the fact that public reaction to past commitment may be less than the reaction to aberrant behavior detract from this assessment.  The aberrant behavior may disappear, while the fact of past institutionalization lasts forever.\n\n\n4\n This is also true of a child removed from the control of his parents.  For the juvenile court then has a duty to \"secure for him care as nearly as possible equivalent to that which [his parents] should have given him.\"  Ga.Code \u00a7 24A-101 (1978).\n\n\n5\n \"The power of the guardian over the person of his or her ward shall be the same as that of the parent over his or her child, the guardian standing in his or her place;  and in like manner it shall be the duty of the guardian to protect and maintain, and, according to the circumstances of the ward, to educate him or her.\"\n\n\n6\n Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788, was an entirely different case.  The Court's opinion today discusses some of these differences, ante, at 604, but I think there is a more fundamental one.  The Danforth case involved an expectant mother's right to decide upon an abortion\u2014a personal substantive constitutional right.  Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147; Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 93 S.Ct. 739, 35 L.Ed.2d 201.  By contrast, the appellees in this case had no substantive constitutional right not to be hospitalized for psychiatric treatment.\n\n\n7\n See Mr. Justice BRENNAN's opinion, post, at 630-631, and n. 16.\n\n\n8\n The Prince case held that the State may constitutionally intervene in the parent-child relationship for the purpose of enforcing its child-labor law.\nIf the State intervened, its procedures would, of course, be subject to the limitations imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n1\n See Winters v.

First, hearings will promote accuracy and ensure that the superintendent diverts children who do not require hospitalization to more appropriate programs. Second, the hearings themselves may prove therapeutic.  Children who feel that they have received a fair hearing may be more likely to accept the legitimacy of their confinement, acknowledge their illness, and cooperate with those attempting to give treatment. This, in turn, would remove a significant impediment to successful therapy.  See Katz, The Right to Treatment\u2014An Enchanting Legal Fiction?, 36 U.Chi.L.Rev. 755, 768-769 (1969);  O'Connor v.

Granberg, San Francisco, Cal., for respondent.\nJerome Feit, Washington, D.C., for the United States, as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\nMr. Justice FORTAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis case presents the question whether state prisoners who have commenced habeas corpus proceedings in a federal district court may, in proper circumstances, utilize the instrument of interrogatories for discovery purposes.\n\nI.\n\n2\nPetitioner is the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Respondent is the warden of the California State Prison at San Quentin. The proceeding was initiated by Alfred Walker who had been convicted in the California courts of the crime of possession of marihuana. After exhausting state remedies, he filed a petition for habeas corpus in the Federal District Court, alleging that evidence seized in the search incident to his arrest was improperly admitted at his trial. The basis for this claim was his allegation that the arrest and incidental search were based solely on the statement of an informant who, according to Walker's sworn statement, was not shown to have been reliable; who, in fact, was unreliable; and whose statements were accepted by the police without proper precautionary procedures.\n\n\n3\nThe District Court issued an order to show cause and respondent made return. Thereafter, Walker filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing, which the District Court granted. Two months later, Walker served upon the respondent warden a series of interrogatories, pursuant to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, seeking discovery of certain facts directed to proof of the informant's unreliability. Respondent filed objections to the interrogatories, alleging the absence of authority for their issuance. The District Judge, without stating his reasons, disallowed the objections and directed that the interrogatories be answered. Respondent applied to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for a writ of mandamus or prohibition. The Ninth Circuit vacated the order of the District Court. It held that the discovery provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were not applicable to habeas corpus proceedings and that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246, the statutory provision specifically relating to the use of interrogatories in habeas corpus proceedings, did not authorize their use for discovery.

Harris, 378 F.2d 141 (1967).\n\n\n4\nBecause of the importance of the questions presented and the diversity of views among the district and appellate courts that have considered the problem,1 we granted certiorari. 392 U.S. 925, 88 S.Ct. 2289, 20 L.Ed.2d 1384. We agree with the Ninth Circuit that Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is not applicable to habeas corpus proceedings and that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246 does not authorize inter ogatories except in limited circumstances not applicable to this case; but we conclude that, in appropriate circumstances, a district court, confronted by a petition for habeas corpus which establishes a prima facie case for relief, may use or authorize the use of suitable discovery procedures, including interrogatories, reasonably fashioned to elicit facts necessary to help the court to 'dispose of the matter as law and justice require.' 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the case in order that the District Court may reconsider the matter before it in light of our opinion and judgment.\n\nII.\n\n5\nThe writ of habeas corpus is the fundamental instrument for safeguarding individual freedom against arbitrary and lawless state action. Its pre-eminent role is recognized by the admonition in the Constitution that: 'The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended * * *.' U.S.Const., Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2. The scope and flexibility of the writ\u2014its capacity to reach all manner of illegal detention\u2014its ability to cut through barriers of form and procedural mazes\u2014have always been emphasized and jealously guarded by courts and lawmakers. The very nature of the writ demands that it be administered with the initiative and flexibility essential to insure that miscarriages of justice within its reach are surfaced and corrected.\n\n\n6\nAs Blackstone phrased it, habeas corpus is 'the great and efficacious writ, in all manner of illegal confinement.'2 As this Court said in Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 401\u2014402, 83 S.Ct. 822, 829, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963), the office of the writ is 'to provide a prompt and efficacious remedy for whatever society deems to be intolerable restraints.' See Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 65\u201467, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 1555, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968).\n\n\n7\nIt is now established beyond the reach of reasonable dispute that the federal courts not only may grant evidentiary hearings to applicants, but must do so upon an appropriate showing. Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 313, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963); Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 464, No. 19, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953). And this Court has emphasized, taking into account the office of the writ and the fact that  he petitioner, being in custody, is usually handicapped in developing the evidence needed to support in necessary detail the facts alleged in his petition, that a habeas corpus proceeding must not be allowed to founder in a 'procedural morass.' Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 269, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948).\n\n\n8\nThere is no higher duty of a court, under our constitutional system, than the careful processing and adjudication of petitions for writs of habeas corpus, for it is in such proceedings that a person in custody charges that error, neglect, or evil purpose has resulted in his unlawful confinement and that he is deprived of his freedom contrary to law. This Court has insistently said that the power of the federal courts to conduct inquiry in habeas corpus is equal to the responsibility which the writ involves: 'The language of Congress, the history of the writ, the decisions of this Court, all make clear that the power of inquiry on federal habeas corpus is plenary.' Townsend v. Sain, supra, at 312, 83 S.Ct. at 757.\n\n\n9\nIn the present case, we are confronted with a procedural problem which tests the reality of these great principles. We are asked by Walker to establish the existence of rights for those in custody to discover facts which may aid their petitions for release. We are asked to do this by declaring that the provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure granting such rights to litigants in civil causes are available to Walker; or if we refuse so to conclude, to affirm the existence of power in the District Court to authorize discovery by written interrogatories. We address ourselves to those issues.\n\nIII.\n\n10\nRule 1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that: 'These rules govern the procedure in the United States district courts in all suits of a civil nature * * * with the exceptions stated in Rule 81.' At the time of the decision below Rule 81(a)(2) provided, in relevant part, that the Rules were not applicable in habeas corpus 'except to the extent that the practice in such proceedings is not set forth in statutes of the United States and has heretofore conformed to the practice in actions at law or suits in equity.'3\n\n\n11\nThe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the second requirement\u2014' conformity' with practice\u2014made it necessary to show that 'prior to September 16, 1938, discovery was actually being used in habeas proceedings, and that such use conformed to the then discovery practice in actions at law or suits in equity.' 378 F.2d, at 144. No such showing was made and it is not here contended that it can be made. Walker contends, however, that the rule requires only a showing that habeas proceedings conformed generally to pre-existing practice in law and equity, and he contends that this general requirement is met.\n\n\n12\nWe need not consider this contention that the Court of Appeals took an unnecessarily restricted view of the thrust of the 'conformity' requirement, because for other reasons we conclude that the intended scope of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the history of habeas corpus procedure, make it clear that Rule 81(a)(2) must be read to exclude the application of Rule 33 in habeas corpus proceedings.\n\n\n13\nIt is, of course, true that habeas corpus proceedings are characterized as 'civil.' See, e.g., Fisher v. Baker, 203 U.S. 174, 181,  7 S.Ct. 135, 51 L.Ed. 142 (1906). But the label is gross and inexact.4 Essentially, the proceeding is unique. Habeas corpus practice in the federal courts has conformed with civil practice only in a general sense. There is no indication that with respect to pretrial proceedings for the development of evidence, habeas corpus practice had conformed to the practice at law or in equity 'to the extent' that the application of rules newly developed in 1938 to govern discovery in 'civil' cases should apply in order to avoid a divergence in practice which had theretofore been substantially uniform. Although there is little direct evidence, relevant to the present problem, of the purpose of the 'conformity' provision of Rule 81(a)(2), the concern of the draftsmen, as a general matter, seems to have been to provide for the continuing applicability of the 'civil' rules in their new form to those areas of practice in habeas corpus and other enumerated proceedings in which the 'specified' proceedings had theretofore utilized the modes of civil practice. Otherwise, those proceedings were to be considered outside of the scope of the rules without prejudice, of course, to the use of particular rules by analogy or otherwise, where appropriate.5\n\n\n14\nSuch specific evidence as there is with respect to the intent of the draftsmen of the rules indicates nothing more than a general and nonspecific understanding that the rules would have very limited application to habeas corpus proceedings. At the very least, it is clear that there was no intention to extend to habeas corpus, as a matter of right, the broad discovery provisions which, even in ordinary civil litigation, were 'one of the most significant innovations' of the new rules. Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 500, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed. 451 (1947). Walker does not claim that there was any general discovery practice in habeas corpus proceedings prior to adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n15\nIn considering the intended application of the new rules to habeas corpus, it is illuminating to note that in 1938 the expansion of federal habeas corpus to its present scope was only in its early stages. Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103, 55 S.Ct. 340, 79 L.Ed. 791 (1935); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938); Waley v. Johnston, 316 U.S. 101, 62 S.Ct. 964, 86 L.Ed. 1302 (1942). It was not until many years later that the federal courts considering a habeas corpus petition were held to be required in many cases to make an independent determination of the factual ba is of claims that state convictions had violated the petitioner's federal constitutional rights. Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953); Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963). In these circumstances it is readily understandable that, as indicated by the language and the scanty contemporary exegesis of Rule 81(a)(2) which is available, the draftsmen of the rule did not contemplate that the discovery provisions of the rules would be applicable to habeas corpus proceedings.\n\n\n16\nIt is also of some relevance that in 1948, when Congress enacted 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246 expressly referring to the right of parties in habeas corpus proceedings to propound written interrogatories, its legislation was limited to interrogatories for the purpose of obtaining evidence from affiants where affidavits were admitted in evidence. Again, the restricted scope of this legislation indicates that the adoption in 1938 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure was not intended to make available in habeas corpus proceedings the discovery provisions of those rules.\n\n\n17\nIndeed, it is difficult to believe that the draftsmen of the Rules or Congress would have applied the discovery rules without modification to habeas corpus proceedings because their specific provisions are ill-suited to the special problems and character of such proceedings. For example, Rule 33, which Walker here invoked, provides for written interrogatories to be served by any party upon any 'adverse party.' As the present case illustrates, this would usually mean that the prisoner's interrogatories must be directed to the warden although the warden would be unable to answer from personal knowledge questions rulating to petitioner's arrest and trial. Presumably the warden could solicit answers from the appropriate officials and reply 'under oath,' as the rule requires; but the warden is clearly not the kind of 'adversary party' contemplated by the discovery rules, and the result of their literal application would be to invoke a procedure which is circuitous, burdensome, and time consuming.\n\n\n18\nThe scope of interrogatories which may be served under Rule 33 also indicates the unsuitability of applying to habeas corpus provisions which were drafted without reference to its peculiar problems.\n\n\n19\nBy reference to Rule 26(b), the rule would give the prisoner a right to inquire into 'any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action,' whether admissible at trial or not. This rule has been generously construed to provide a great deal of latitude for discovery. See Hickman v. Taylor, supra, at 507, 67 S.Ct. 385; 2A Barron & Holtzoff, supra, \u00a7 646. Such a broad-ranging preliminary inquiry is neither necessary nor appropriate in the context of a habeas corpus proceeding.\n\n\n20\nExcept for interrogatories to be served by the 'plaintiff' within 10 days after the commencement of 'the action,' Rule 33 provides that the interrogatories may be served without leave of court. The 'adverse party' must then take the initiative to contest the interrogatories and a hearing in court on his objections is required. Unavoidably, unless there is a measure of responsibility in the originator of the proceeding, the 'plaintiff' or petitioner, this procedure can be exceedingly burdensome and vexatious. The interrogatory procedure would be available to the prisoners themselves since most habeas petitions are prepared and filed by prisoners, generally without the guidance or restraint of members of the bar. For this reason, too, we conclude that the literal application of Rule 33 to habeas corpus proceedings would do violence to the efficient and effective administration of the Great Writ. The burden upon courts, prison officials, prosecutors, and police, which is necessarily and properly incident to the processing and adjudication of habeas corpus proceedings, would be vastly increased; and the benefit to prisoners would be counterbalanced by the delay which the elaborate discovery proceduces would necessarily entail.\n\n\n21\nIt is true that the availability of Rule 33 would provide prisoners with an instrument of discovery which could be activated on their own initiative, without prior court approval, and that this would be of considerable tactical advantage to them in the prosecution of their efforts to demonstrate such error in their trial as would result in their release. But despite the forceful and ingenious argument of Walker's counsel and amici curiae,6 this consideration cannot carry the day. It is a long march from this contention to a conclusion that the discovery provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were intended to extend to habeas corpus proceedings. We have no power to rewrite the Rules by judicial interpretations. We have no power to decide that Rule 33 applies to habeas corpus proceedings unless, on conventional principles of statutory construction, we can properly conclude that the literal language or the intended effect of the Rules indicates that this was within the purpose of the draftsmen or the congressional understanding.\n\nIV.\n\n22\nTo conclude that the Federal Rules' discovery provisions do not apply completely and automatically by virtue of Rule 81(a)(2) is not to say that there is no way in which a district court may, in an appropriate case, arrange for procedures which will allow development, for purposes of the hearing, of the facts relevant to disposition of a habeas corpus petition. Petitioners in habeas corpus proceedings, as the Congress and this Court have emphasized, and as we have discussed, supra, at 290\u2014292, are entitled to careful consideration and plenary processing of their claims including full opportunity for presentation of the relevant facts. Congress has provided that once a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is filed, unless the court is of the opinion that the petitioner is not entitled to an order to show cause, the writ must be awarded 'forthwith,' or an order to show cause must be issued. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243. Thereafter, if the court concludes that the petitioner is entitled to an evidentiary hearing, cf. Townsend v. Sain, supra; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, it shall order one to be held promptly. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243.\n\n\n23\nFlexible provision is made for taking evidence by oral testimony, by deposition, or upon affidavit and written interrogatory. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246. Cf. \u00a7\u00a7 2245, 2254(e). The court shall 'summarily hear and determine the facts, and dispose of the matter as law and justice require.'28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243. But with respect to methods for securing facts where necessary to accomplish the objective of the proceedings Congress has been largely silent. Clearly, in these circumstances, the habeas corpus jurisdiction and the duty to exercise it being present, the courts may fashion appropriate modes of procedure, by analogy to existing rules or otherwise in conformity with judicial usage. Where their duties require it, this is the inescapable obligation of the courts. Their authority is expressly confirmed in the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651. This statute has served since its inclusion, in substance, in the original Judiciary Act as a 'legislatively approved source of procedural instruments designed to achieve 'the rational ends of law.\" Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 282, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 1058, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948), quoting Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U.S. 269, 273, 63 S.Ct. 236, 239, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1942). It has been recognized that the courts may rely upon this statute in issuing orders appropriate to assist them in conducting factual inquiries. American Lithographic Co. v. Werckmeister, 221 U.S. 603, 609, 31 S.Ct. 676, 55 L.Ed. 873 (1911) (subpoenas duces tecum); Bethlehem Shipbuildi g Corp. v. NLRB, 120 F.2d 126, 127 (C.A.1st Cir. 1941) (order that certain documents be produced for the purpose of pretrial discovery). In price v. Johnston, supra, this Court held explicitly that the purpose and function of the All Writs Act to supply the courts with the instruments needed to perform their duty, as prescribed by the Congress and the Constitution, provided only that such instruments are 'agreeable' to the usages and principles of law, extend to habeas corpus proceedings.\n\n\n24\nAt any time in the proceedings, when the court considers that it is necessary to do so in order that a fair and meaningful evidentiary hearing may be held so that the court may properly 'dispose of the matter as law and justice require,' either on its own motion or upon cause shown by the petitioner, it may issue such writs and take or authorize such proceedings with respect to development, before or in conjunction with the hearing of the facts relevant to the claims advanced by the parties, as may be 'necessary or appropriate in aid of (its jurisdiction) * * * and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.' 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651.\n\n\n25\nWe do not assume that courts in the exercise of their discretion will pursue or authorize pursuit of all allegations presented to them. We are aware that confinement sometimes induces fantasy which has its basis in the paranoia of prison rather than in fact. But where specific allegations before the court show reason to believe that the petitioner may, if the facts are fully developed, be able to demonstrate that he is confined illegally and is therefore entitled to relief, it is the duty of the court to provide the necessary facilities and procedures for an adequate inquiry. Obviously, in exercising this power, the court may utilize familiar procedures, as appropriate, whether these are found in the civil or criminal rules or elsewhere in the 'usages and principles of law.'7\n\n\n26\nAccordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n\n\n27\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n28\nMr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n\n\n29\nI would affirm the Court of Appeals' holding in this case, Wilson v. Harris, 378 F.2d 141, that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246 does not authorize discovery in habeas corpus proceedings. Upon affirmance I would not go further and write what appears to me to be in effect an advisory opinion directing the trial court t  formulate some kind of new legal system for discovery in this kind of case. Fully agreeing with the Court's statement that '(w)e have no power to rewrite the Rules by judicial interpretations.' I go further and doubt that we have power to direct lower courts to write new laws providing for discovery in habeas corpus cases. This is a complicated field of law making and I think we should not enter this field in the absence of some valid delegation of legislative power by the Congress. Since I cannot agree that Congress has granted us such power, I am unable to go along with the Court's opinion.\n\n\n30\nThere have been many complaints among members of the bar about many Court-made rules of procedure and I would venture the suggestion that in no field have the number of those complaints exceeded the complaints in this particular field of discovery. I regret that I cannot 'assume,' with the Court, that given blanket authority, 'courts in the exercise of their discretion will (not) pursue or authorize pursuit of all allegations presented to them.' This case makes me skeptical about such an assumption. Here Walker was convicted in a state court of having marihuana in his possession. After exhausting all state remedies he asked the federal courts to let him out of jail. He apparently did not allege his innocence, does not now do so, and this Court apparently does not now consider the question of guilt or innocence in this case. What he does allege is that the trial court made an error in admitting certain evidence against him. It is not alleged that the evidence was not relevant against him or that the verdict resting on that evidence was not a truthful, honest verdict. We must, therefore, assume that he was and is guilty of the crime of which he was convicted. See my dissent in Kaufman v. United States, 394 U.S. 217, 231, 89 S.Ct. 1068, 1076, 22 L.Ed.2d 227, decided today. What is relevant, however, and all that is alleged, is that the evidence used against him, presumably the marihuana, was found on his premises as the result of a search made after a statement by a person to a policeman, which statement the allegations now charge 'was not shown to have been reliable' and which was made by a person 'who was in fact unreliable.' It may be possible that a new trial over this issue can establish that the person telling the officer that marihuana could be found on Walker's premises was an 'unreliable' person and that the statement he made was also 'unreliable.' But the fact remains that the marihuana was found where the unreliable person's unreliable statement told the officer it would be found. Consequently it appears to me that the present case against a defendant whose guilt has been proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt should not be taken as an appropriate one on which this Court lays the groundwork for a new and vast judicial legislative rule-making program.\n\n\n31\nPerhaps it might not be considered amiss mildly to suggest that in cases like this, where records contain no question at all about guilt, some convictions should at some time be treated as final and no longer subject to challenge, at least by collateral attack. Although I admit that Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964), and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969), go a long way, I had not previously thought that even these cases could support what the Court is doing in this case.\n\n\n32\nMr. Justice HARLAN, whom Mr. Justice WHITE joins, dissenting.\n\n\n33\nI agree that neither Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure nor any statute authorizes the interrogatories sought in this case. I further agree that district courts do have power to require discovery when essential to render a habeas corpus proceeding effective. But I would make it explicit that such power is narrow and should be exercised sparingly, and would not set the district courts 'at large,' as I fear today's opinion may be taken to do.\n\nI.\n\n34\nThis case furnishes an apt illustration of th  differences between my viewpoint and what seems to be that of the majority. As stated more fully in the Court's opinion ante, at 288-289, Walker claimed that marihuana admitted at his trial was seized incident to an arrest which was based upon information supplied by an unreliable informant. After the District Court had ordered an evidentiary hearing, Walker directed to the respondent warden a series of interrogatories designed to establish the unreliabilty of the informant. The interrogatories asked whether the officer who arrested Walker had made previous arrests or searches on the basis of information given by the same informant; if so, whether such arrests or searches resulted in convictions; and whether the informant had ever supplied information which the officer considered unreliable.\n\n\n35\nIt seems apparent that this discovery was not essential to an adequate habeas proceeding. All of the information sought was known to the arresting officer. Walker knew the officer's identity; in fact, the officer had testified at the preliminary hearing and at trial on the very issue of the informant's reliability. Hence, there is no reason to believe that all of the information could not have been obtained by calling the officer as a witness at the habeas hearing. Although I realize that the parties have not directed their arguments to this precise question. I am satisfied that on the face of things Walker cannot possibly show that this discovery is essential to a fair proceeding. Accordingly, I would affirm outright the judgment of the Court of Appeals.1\n\nII.\n\n36\nThe more troublesome aspect of the Court's opinion is its long-run implications. For it can be taken as suggesting that the best solution to the problem of discovery in habeas corpus proceedings is to permit each district court to devise 'appropriate modes of procedure' on a case-by-case basis. As regards the immediate future, a case-by-case approach may be unavoidable, since there is at present no body of applicable discovery rules and the district courts must have power to order discovery which is essential to effective disposition of habeas applications. But I consider that from a broader standpoint the problem of habeas discovery should be dealt with not case by case but through exercise of our rule-making power. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072.\n\n\n37\nThere are several reasons for believing that a case-by-case approach will be unsatisfactory in the long range. It seems to me that in fairness both to habeas petitioners and to their adversaries, the discovery procedures which are available in such actions should be uniform throughout the federal system and not dependent upon the varying 'discovery attitudes' of particular district judges. If discovery procedures are developed case by case, there will at the least be a very long period during which procedures will differ from distri t to district. Even assuming that a coherent body of rules finally will emerge because of the unifying influence of appellate decisions, it is unlikely that the rules thus generated will be the best that could have been devised. Appellate courts, including this one, are imperfectly informed both about the extent of the need for additional discovery in habeas corpus and about the procedures best suited to meet those needs and to achieve prompt dispatch of habeas proceedings. They are, therefore, poorly situated to lay down guidelines for the district courts. Moreover, discovery rules fashioned in the course of day-to-day adjudication are likely to suffer from the limitations which accompany that process.\n\n\n38\nSuch considerations lead me to think that, in the longer view, the formulation of discovery rules can best be accomplished through use of the power which Congress has conferred upon us to establish general rules governing civil procedure in the federal district courts. By using this method of rule making, the advice of the Judicial Conference of the United States and its appropriate advisory committees could be obtained.2 These bodies are well equipped to assess the dimensions of the discovery problem and devise apt solutions. Their deliberations would be free from the time pressures and piecemeal character of case-by-case adjudication. And the resulting rules would be uniform throughout the federal system.\n\n\n39\nMy conviction that this would be the best course is strengthened by recollection of our decision in Miner v. Atlas, 363 U.S. 641, 80 S.Ct. 1300, 4 L.Ed.2d 1462 (1960), and the events which followed. In Miner we held that a District Court sitting in admiralty had no power to order the taking of an oral discovery deposition. Responding to a suggestion in our opinion, see 363 U.S., at 651, 80 S.Ct. 1300, and to earlier stirrings at the bar, the Judicial Conference and the Advisory Committee on General Admiralty Rules swiftly proposed new Admiralty Rules authorizing certain additional kinds of discovery, including oral depositions. After approval by this Court and submission to Congress, as required by statute,3 the new Admiralty Rules went into effect a little more than a year after our decision.4 There is no reason to think that the Judicial Conference and the advisory committees would not be equally cooperative in this instance.\n\n\n40\nFor the reasons stated in Part I of this opinion, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case.\n\n\n41\nMr. Justice STEWART, dissenting.\n\n\n42\nI concur with most of what is said in the Court's opinion, but cannot concur in its judgment.\n\n\n43\nI wholly agree that Rule 33 is inapplicable to habeas corpus proceedings. Contrary to my Brother HARLAN, I further agree that federal judges in carrying out their duty to dispose of habeas corpus applications 'as law and justice require,' 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243, should not be inhibited by inflexibly formalized procedural rules. In getting at the facts in such cases, the district courts should be given wide leeway for 'discretion to exercise their common sense.' Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 495, 82 S.Ct. 510, 514, 7 L.Ed.2d 473.*\n\n\n44\nHowever, for the reasons stated in Mr. Justice Harlan's dissenting opinion today in Kaufman v. United States, 394 U.S. 217, 242, 89 S.Ct. 1068, 1082, 22 L.Ed.2d 227, which I have joined, I would affirm the judgment in the present case.\n\n\n\n1\n Some courts have joined the Ninth Circuit in holding the discovery provisions of the Federal Rules wholly inapplicable to habeas corpus proceedings. E.g. Sullivan v. United States, 198 F.Supp. 624, 625\u2014627 (D.C.S.D.N.Y.1961). On other occasions it has been held that the Rules apply only by 'analogy.' Wilson v. Weigel, 387 F.2d 632, 634, n. 3 (C.A.9th Cir. 1967); cf. United States ex rel. Jelic v. District Director of Immigration, 106 F.2d 14, 20 (C.A.2d Cir. 1939) (opinion by Judge Clark, who served as Reporter of the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure). Several courts have held the Rules applicable because habeas is characterized generally as a 'civil' proceeding. E.g., United States ex rel. Seals v. Wiman, 304 F.2d 53, 64 (C.A.5th Cir. 1962); cf. Schiebelhut v. United States, 318 F.2d 785, 786 (C.A.6th Cir. 1963) (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 action). Some courts have sustained the use of particular discovery rules under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as necessary to effectuate statutory policy with respect to habeas corpus. E.g., Knowles v. Gladden, 254 F.Supp. 643, 644\u2014645 (D.C.Ore.1965), aff'd 378 F.2d 761 (C.A.9th Cir. 1967). Others have apparently assumed that the rules applied to habeas without discussion of the question. E.g., Fortner v. Balkcom, 380 F.2d 816, 818 (C.A.5th Cir. 1967).\n\n\n2\n 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *131 (Lewis ed. 1902). See generally Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 399\u2014415, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963). Cf. Frank v. Mangum, 237 U.S. 309, 346, 35 S.Ct. 582, 595, 59 L.Ed. 969 (Holmes, J., joined by Hughes, J., dissenting) (1915), '(H)abeas corpus cuts through all forms and goes to the very tissue of the structure. It comes in from the outside * * * and although every form may have been preserved, opens the inquiry whether they have been more than an empty shell.'\n\n\n3\n Rule 81(a)(2) was amended, effective July 1, 1968, to read, 'These rules are applicable to proceedings for * * * habeas corpus * * * to the extent that the practice in such proceedings is not set forth in statutes of the United States and has heretofore conformed to the practice in civil actions.' The amendment merely eliminated references to appellate procedure made inappropriate by the adoption of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and does not affect the issue before us. See Report of the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Judicial Conference of the United States, 43 F.R.D. 61, 164 (explanatory note to the proposed revision of Rule 81(a)(2)).\n\n\n4\n The degree to which this characterization excessively simplifies a complex history is discussed in Cohen, Some Considerations on the Origins of Habeas Corpus, 16 Can.B.Rev. 92 (1938), and Cohen, Habeas Corpus Cum Causa\u2014The Emergence of the Modern Writ, 18 Can.B.Rev. 10, 172 (1940). Cf. Sullivan v. United States, 198 F.Supp. 624 (D.C.S.D.N.Y.1961).\n\n\n5\n The federal courts have applied some noncontroversial rules in habeas corpus proceedings. E.g., Rule 6(b)(2), extension of time for excusable neglect, Bowen v. Boles, 258 F.Supp. 111 (D.C.N.D.W.Va.1966); Rule 15(b), determination of issue not raised by pleadings. Hamilton v. Hunter, 65 F.Supp. 319 (D.C.Kan.1946). See also 1 W. Barron & A. Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 131 (C. Wright ed. 1960); Note, Civil Discovery in Habeas Corpus, 67 Col.L.Rev. 1296, 1299 (1967). The applicability to habeas corpus of the rules concerning joinder and class actions has engendered considerable debate. See Mitchell v. Schoonfield, 285 F.Supp. 728 (D.C.Md.1968); Hill v. Nelson, 272 F.Supp. 790 (D.C.N.D.Calif.1967); Adderly v. Wainwright, 272 F.Supp. 530 (D.C.M.D.Fla.1967). Cf. Note, Multiparty Federal Habeas Corpus, 81 Harv.L.Rev. 1482 (1968). The only issue before the Court in this case is the applicability to habeas corpus proceedings of those rules which deal with discovery. We intimate no view on whether the Federal Rules may be applicable with respect to other aspects of a habeas corpus proceeding.\n\n\n6\n In our consideration of this case, we have been assisted greatly by the briefs of the amici curiae\u2014the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the National Office for the Rights of the Indigent in support of petitioner, and the United States and the State of New York in support of respondent.\n\n\n7\n Mr. Justice HARLAN, dissenting, agrees that district courts have power to require discovery when essential to render a habeas corpus proceeding effective. He dissents because he would substitute the judgment of this remote Court for that of the District Court as to the need for authorizing discovery in this case. Mr. Justice HARLAN then expresses his views as to the desirability of formulating discovery rules under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072, applicable to federal habeas and \u00a7 2255 proceedings. In our view, the desirability of launching rule-making proceedings does not and could not affect the decision in the present case.\nIn view of his remarks, however, we have concluded that we should express agreement with our Brother HARLAN as to the desirability of rule making in this field. We repeat that it does not follow from this that district judges are without power to enter necessary orders in the absense of rules.\nIn fact, it is our view that the rule-making machinery should be invoked to formulate rules of practice with respect to federal habeas corpus and \u00a7 2255 proceedings, on a comprehensive basis and not merely one confined to discovery. The problems presented by these proceedings are materially different from those dealt with in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and reliance upon usage and the opaque language of Civil Rule 81(a)(2) is transparently inadequate. In our view the results of a meticulous formulation and adoption of special rules for federal habeas corpus and \u00a7 2255 proceedings would promise much benefit.\n\n\n1\n My Brother STEWART bases his dissent in this case upon my own dissenting opinion in Kaufman v. United States, 394 U.S. 217, 242, 89 S.Ct. 1068, 1082, 22 L.Ed.2d 227, in which I have taken the position that in actions brought by federal prisoners under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 Fourth Amendment claims should be entertained only upon a showing of 'special circumstances.' I prefer to rest my disagreement with the result in this case upon other grounds, for two reasons. First, this case is not on all fours with Kaufman, since this was a federal habeas action by a state prisoner rather than an action by a federal prisoner under \u00a7 2255. The Kaufman question has not been briefed or argued in this case, and there may conceivably be significant distinctions between the two types of proceedings. See, e.g., Amsterdam, Search, Seizure, and Section 2255: A Comment, 112 U.Pa.L.Rev. 378 (1964). Second, although this case happens, like Kaufman, to involve a search-and-seizure issue, the Court's reasoning here plainly applies to all claims cognizable on federal habeas corpus. Hence, it seems appropriate to rest my dissent upon broader grounds, which also appeal to my Brother WHITE.\n\n\n2\n For a brief account of the role played by these bodies in the making of civil rules, see Kaplan, Continuing Work of the Civil Committee: 1966 Amendments of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (I), 81 Harv.L.Rev. 356, 357\u2014358 (1967).\n\n\n3\n See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072, which also specifies that the proposed rules shall not take effect for 90 days after they have been reported to Congress.\n\n\n4\n See Admiralty Rules 30A\u201430G, 32, 32B\u201432D, which were either added or amended effective July 19, 1961.\n\n\n*\n The Machibroda case arose under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the statutory counterpart of habeas corpus.

His motion to suppress the marihuana was initially denied by the District Court. Thereafter, this Court ruled in Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973), that a warrantless roving patrol search of a vehicle conducted without probable cause on a road removed from the border, violated the Fourth Amendment. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit subsequently ruled in United States v. King, 485 F.2d 353 (10 Cir. 1973), and United States v. Maddox, 485 F.2d 361 (10 Cir. 1973), that Almeida-Sanchez should be applied retroactively.1 The District Court then reconsidered the respondent's motion to suppress, and on October 4, 1974, dismissed the indictment.\n\n\n2\nOn October 16, 1974, the Government filed a \"Motion to Set Aside (the) Order of Dismissal\" on the ground that the facts in this case were materially different from those in Almeida-Sanchez and that \"the Order dismissing the case was entered through inadvertence.\" On November 6, 1974, the District Court denied the motion on the ground that it had \"no authority or jurisdiction\" to set aside the order. On November 7, 1974, the Government filed a notice of appeal.\n\n\n3\n(1) The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal, holding that it was untimely because the notice of appeal had not been filed until 34 days after entry of the October 4 order and hence fell outside the 30-day limitation period for a Government appeal from an order dismissing an indictment.2 The appellate court held that the October 4 order was final for purposes of appeal, notwithstanding the Government's October 16 motion to set aside that order. In denying the Government's petition for rehearing and suggestion for rehearing en banc, the court recognized that in United States v. Healy, 376 U.S. 75, 84 S.Ct. 553, 11 L.Ed.2d 527 (1964), decided at a time when a Government appeal from an order dismissing an indictment was taken directly to this Court rather than to a court of appeals, we held that the 30-day limitation period runs from the denial of a timely petition in the District Court for rehearing, rather than from the date of the order itself. The Court of Appeals reasoned, however, that Healy did not control because the post-dismissal motion there involved \"was directed squarely at an alleged error of law committed by the trial court,\" whereas in this case the Government's motion \"to set aside on the grounds of mistake or inadvertence was an entirely different species of pleading . . . .\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 4A.\n\n\n4\n(2) The Court of Appeals misconceived the basis of our decision in Healy. We noted there that the consistent practice in civil and criminal cases alike has been to treat timely petitions for rehearing as rendering the original judgment nonfinal for purposes of appeal for as long as the petition is pending. 376 U.S., at 78-79, 84 S.Ct., at 555-56.3 To have held otherwise might have prolonged litigation and unnecessarily burdened this Court, since plenary consideration of an issue by an appellate court ordinarily requires more time than is required for disposition by a trial court of a petition for rehearing. Id., at 80, 84 S.Ct., at 556. The fact that appeals are now routed to the courts of appeals does not affect the wisdom of giving district courts the opportunity promptly to correct their own alleged errors, and we must likewise be wary of imposing added and unnecessary burdens on the courts of appeals. These considerations fully apply whether the issue presented on appeal is termed one of fact or of law, and the Court of Appeals' law\/fact distinction assuming such a distinction can be clearly drawn for these purposes finds no support in Healy. It is true that the Government's post-dismissal motion was not captioned a \"petition for rehearing,\" but there can be no doubt that in purpose and effect it was precisely that, asking the District Court to \"reconsider (a) question decided in the case\" in order to effect an \"alteration of the rights adjudicated.\" Department of Banking v. Pink, 317 U.S. 264, 266, 63 S.Ct. 233, 234, 87 L.Ed. 254 (1942).\n\n\n5\nThe motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for certiorari are granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings.\n\n\n6\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n1\n That view was later repudiated by this Court in United States v. Peltier, 422 U.S. 531, 95 S.Ct. 2313, 45 L.Ed.2d 374 (1975).\n\n\n2\n Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731 provides in pertinent part that \"(i)n a criminal case an appeal by the United States shall lie to a court of appeals from a decision, judgment, or order of a district court dismissing an indictment or information as to any one or more counts,\" and that \"(t)he appeal in all such cases shall be taken within thirty days after the decision, judgment or order has been rendered . . ..\" Federal Rule App. Proc. 4(b) provides in pertinent part:\n\"When an appeal by the government is authorized by statute, the notice of appeal shall be filed in the district court within 30 days after the entry of the judgment or order appealed from. A judgment or order is entered within the meaning of this subdivision when it is entered in the criminal docket.\"\n\n\n3\n The Court of Appeals' concern with the lack of a statute or rule expressly authorizing treatment of a post-dismissal motion as suspending the limitation period ignores our having grounded our decision in Healy, not on any express authorization (which was similarly lacking in Healy ), but rather on \"traditional and virtually unquestioned practice.\" 376 U.S., at 79, 84 S.Ct., at 556.\n\n\n","label":0}

OMAHA INDIAN TRIBE et al.\nNos. 78-160, 78-161.\nArgued March 21, 1979.\nDecided June 20, 1979.\n\n\nSyllabus\n\nPursuant to an 1854 treaty, the reservation of the Omaha Indian Tribe (Tribe) was established in the Territory of Nebraska on the west bank of the Missouri River, with the eastern boundary being fixed as the center of the river's main channel.  In 1867, a General Land Office survey established that certain land was included in the reservation but since then the river has changed course several times, leaving most of the survey area on the Iowa side of the river, separated from the rest of the reservation. Residents of Iowa ultimately settled on and improved this land, and these non-Indian owners and their successors in title occupied the land for many years prior to April 2, 1975, when they were dispossessed by the Tribe, with the assistance of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  Three federal actions, consolidated in District Court, were instituted by respondents, the Tribe and the United States as trustee of the reservation lands, against petitioners, including the State of Iowa and several individuals.  Both sides sought to quiet title in their names, respondents arguing that the river's movement had been avulsive and thus did not affect the reservation's boundary, whereas petitioners argued that the disputed land had been formed by gradual accretion and belonged to the Iowa riparian owners.  The District Court held that state rather than federal law should be the basis of decision;  that 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 194\u2014which provides that \"[i]n all trials about the right of property in which an Indian may be a party on one side, and a white person on the other, the burden of proof shall rest upon the white person, whenever the Indian shall make out a presumption of title in himself from the fact of previous possession or ownership\"\u2014was not applicable because the Tribe could not make out a prima facie case that it possessed the disputed land in the past without proving its case on the merits;  and that under Nebraska law, the changes in the river had been accretive and thus the petitioners were the owners of the disputed area.  The Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that federal rather than state law was applicable;  that the Tribe had made a sufficient showing to invoke \u00a7 194;  and that applying the federal common law of accretion and avulsion to the evidence, the evidence was in equipoise and thus, under \u00a7 194, judgment must be entered for the Tribe.\n\nHeld:\n\n1. The Court of Appeals was partially correct in ruling that \u00a7 194 is applicable here;  by its terms, \u00a7 194 applies to the private petitioners but not to petitioner State of Iowa.  In view of the history of \u00a7 194 and its purpose of protecting Indians from claims made by non-Indian squatters on their lands, it applies even when an Indian tribe is the litigant rather than one or more individual Indians.  But, while Congress was aware that \u00a7 194 would be interpreted to cover artificial entities, such as corporations, as well as individuals, there is nothing to indicate that Congress intended the word \"white person\" to include any of the States of the Union.  Here, there seems to be no question that the disputed land was once riparian land lying on the west bank of the Missouri River and was long occupied by the Tribe as part of the reservation set apart for it in consequence of the 1854 treaty, and this was enough to bring \u00a7 194 into play.  In view of the purpose of the statute and its use of the term \"presumption\" which the \"white man\" must overcome, \u00a7 194 contemplates the non-Indian's shouldering the burden of persuasion as well as the burden of producing evidence once the tribe has made out its prima facie case of prior title or possession.  Pp. 664-669.\n2. The Court of Appeals properly concluded that federal law governs the substantive aspects of the dispute, but it erred in arriving at a federal standard, independent of state law, to determine whether there had been an avulsion or an accretion.  Pp. 669-679.\n(a) The general rule that, absent an overriding federal interest, the laws of the several States determine the ownership of the banks and shores of waterways, Oregon ex rel. State Land Board v. Corvallis Sand & Gravel Co., 429 U.S. 363, 97 S.Ct. 582, 50 L.Ed.2d 550, does not oust federal law in this litigation. Here, the United States has never yielded title or terminated its interest in the property, and, in these circumstances, the Indians' right to the property depends on federal law, \"wholly apart from the application of state law principles which normally and separately protect a valid right of possession.\"  Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida, 414 U.S. 661, 677, 94 S.Ct. 772, 782, 39 L.Ed.2d 73.  Pp. 669-671.\n(b) However, state law should be borrowed as the federal rule of decision here.  There is no imperative need to develop a general body of federal common law to decide cases such as this, where an interstate boundary is not in dispute (the location of the boundary between Iowa and Nebraska having been settled by Compact in 1943).  Furthermore, given equitable application of state law, there is little likelihood of injury to federal trust responsibilities or to tribal possessory interests.  And this is also an area in which the States have substantial interest in having their own law resolve controversies such as these;  there is considerable merit in not having the reasonable expectations, under state real property law, of private landowners upset by the vagaries of being located adjacent to or across from Indian reservations or other property in which the United States has a substantial interest. Cf. Board of Comm'rs v. United States, 308 U.S. 343, 60 S.Ct. 285, 84 L.Ed. 313;  Arkansas v. Tennessee, 246 U.S. 158, 38 S.Ct. 301, 62 L.Ed. 638.  Pp. 671-676.\n(c) Under the construction of the 1943 Compact in Nebraska v. Iowa, 406 U.S. 117, 92 S.Ct. 1379, 31 L.Ed.2d 733, Nebraska law should be applied in determining whether the changes in the river that moved the disputed land from Nebraska to Iowa were avulsive or accretive.

Beale, Detroit, Mich., for respondent United States.\n\n\n5\n[Amicus Curiae Information from pages 655-657 intentionally omitted]\n\n\n6\nMr. Justice WHITE, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n7\nAt issue here is the ownership of a tract of land on the east bank of the Missouri River in Iowa.  Respondent Omaha Indian Tribe, supported by the United States as trustee of the Tribe's reservation lands,1 claims the tract as part of reservation lands created for it under an 1854 treaty. Petitioners, including the State of Iowa and several individuals, argue that past movements of the Missouri River washed away part of the reservation and the soil accreted to the Iowa side of the river, vesting title in them as riparian landowners.2\n\n\n8\nTwo principal issues are presented.  First, we are faced with novel questions regarding the interpretation and scope of Rev.Stat. \u00a7 2126, as set forth in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 194, a 145-year-old, but seldom used, statute that provides:\n\n\n9\n\"In all trials about the right of property in which an      Indian may be a party on one side, and a white person on the      other, the burden of proof shall rest upon the white person,      whenever the Indian shall make out a presumption of title in      himself from the fact of previous possession or ownership.\"\n\n\n10\nSecond, we must decide whether federal or state law determines whether the critical changes in the course of the Missouri River in this case were accretive or avulsive.\n\n\n11\n* In 1854, the Omaha Indian Tribe ceded most of its aboriginal lands by treaty to the United States in exchange for money and assistance to enable the Tribe to cultivate its retained lands. Treaty of Mar. 16, 1854, 10 Stat. 1043;  see United States v. Omaha Indians, 253 U.S. 275, 277-278, 40 S.Ct. 522, 523, 64 L.Ed. 901 (1920).  The retained lands proved unsatisfactory to the Tribe, and it exercised its option under the treaty to exchange those lands for a tract of 300,000 acres to be designated by the President and acceptable to the Tribe.  The Blackbird Hills area, on the west bank of the Missouri, all of which was then part of the Territory of Nebraska, was selected.  The eastern boundary of the reservation was fixed as the center of the main channel of the Missouri River, the thalweg.3  That land, as modified by a subsequent treaty and statutes4 has remained the home of the Omaha Indian Tribe.\n\n\n12\nIn 1867, a survey by T. H. Barrett of the General Land Office established that the reservation included a large peninsula jutting east toward the opposite, Iowa, side of the river, around which the river flowed in an oxbow curve known as Blackbird Bend.5 Over the next few decades, the river changed course several times, sometimes moving east, sometimes west.6  Since 1927, the river has been west of its 1867 position, leaving most of the Barrett survey area on the Iowa side of the river, separated from the rest of the reservation.\n\n\n13\nAs the area, now on the Iowa side, dried out, Iowa residents settled on, improved, and farmed it.  These non-Indian owners and their successors in title occupied the land for many years prior to April 2, 1975, when they were dispossessed by the Tribe, with the assistance of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\n\n14\nFour lawsuits followed the seizure, three in federal court and one in state court.  The Federal District Court for the Northern District of Iowa consolidated the three federal actions, severed claims to damages and lands outside the Barrett survey area, and issued a temporary injunction that permitted the Tribe to continue possession.  The court then tried the case without a jury.  At trial, the Government and the Tribe argued that the river's movement had been avulsive, and therefore the change in location of the river had not affected the boundary of the reservation.  Petitioners argued that the river had gradually eroded the reservation lands on the west bank of the river, and that the disputed land on the east bank, in Iowa, had been formed by gradual accretion and belonged to the east-bank riparian owners.7  Both sides sought to quiet title in their names.\n\n\n15\nThe District Court concluded that state rather than federal law should be the basis of decision.  United States v. Wilson, 433 F.Supp. 57 (1977).  The court interpreted the Rules of Decision Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1652, as not requiring the application of federal law in land disputes, even though the United States and an Indian tribe were claimants,8 unless the Constitution, a treaty, or an Act of Congress specifically supplanted state law.  The court found no indication in those sources that federal law was to govern.  It then went on to conclude that 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 194 was not applicable to the case because it was impossible for the Tribe to make out a prima facie case that it possessed the disputed lands in the past without proving its case on the merits.  Thus, \u00a7 194 had no significance because it was \"inextricably entwined with the merits.\"  433 F.Supp., at 66.9\n\n\n16\nApplying Nebraska law,10 which places the burden of proof on the party seeking to quiet title, the court concluded that the key changes in the river had been accretive, and that the east-bank riparians, the petitioners, were thus the owners of the disputed area.  433 F.Supp. 67 (1977).11\n\n\n17\nThe Court of Appeals reversed.  575 F.2d 620 (CA8 1978).  It began by ruling that the District Court should have applied federal rather than state law for two distinct reasons.  First, the boundary of the reservation was coincidental with an interstate boundary at the time the river moved.  Therefore, under Oregon ex rel. State Land Board v. Corvallis Sand & Gravel Co., 429 U.S. 363, 375, 97 S.Ct. 582, 589, 50 L.Ed.2d 550 (1977), and other cases of this Court, the governing law is federal because\n\n\n18\n\"[t]he rendering of a decision in a private dispute      which would 'press back' an interstate boundary sufficiently      implicates the interests of the states to require the      application of federal common law.\"  575 F.2d at 628.\n\n\n19\nSecond, the Court of Appeals construed our decision in Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida, 414 U.S. 661, 677, 94 S.Ct. 772, 782, 39 L.Ed.2d 73 (1974), as requiring the application of federal law because the Tribe asserted a right to reservation land based directly on the 1854 treaty and therefore arising under and protected by federal law.\n\n\n20\nThe Court of Appeals also ruled that the District Court had erred by refusing to apply 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 194.  Because the Tribe had proved that the 1854 treaty included the land area within the Barrett survey, it had made a sufficient showing of \"previous possession or ownership\" to invoke the statute and place the burden of proof on petitioners.  Adopting the District Court's construction \"would negate the application of the \u00a7 194 statutory burden upon a pleading that simply recites Indian land had been destroyed by the erosive action of a river.\"  575 F.2d, at 631.\n\n\n21\nReviewing what it perceived to be the federal common law of accretion and avulsion and with no more than passing reference to Nebraska law on the issue, the Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court had based its ruling on a too narrow definition of avulsion.12  The court then applied the law to the evidence and found that the evidence was in equipoise. Because \u00a7 194 placed the burden of proof on the non-Indians, however, the court ruled that judgment must be entered for the Tribe.\n\n\n22\nWe granted separate petitions for certiorari filed by the State of Iowa and its Conservation Commission in No. 78-161 and by the individual petitioners in No. 78-160, but limited to the questions whether 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 194 is applicable in the circumstances of this litigation, in particular with respect to the State of Iowa, and whether federal or state law governs the substantive aspects of these cases.  439 U.S. 963, 99 S.Ct. 448, 58 L.Ed.2d 420 (1978).13 We are in partial, but serious, disagreement with the Court of Appeals, and vacate its judgment.\n\nII\n\n23\nPetitioners challenge on several grounds the Court of Appeals' construction and application of \u00a7 194 to these cases.14 First, they argue that by its plain language the section does not apply when an Indian tribe, rather than one or more individual Indians, is the litigant.  We think the argument is untenable. The provision first appeared in slightly different form in 1822, Act of May 6, 1822, 3 Stat. 683, as part of an Act amending the 1802 Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, Act of Mar. 30, 1802, 2 Stat. 139, which was one of a series of Acts originating in 1790 and designed to regulate trade and other forms of intercourse between the North American Indian tribes and non-Indians.15 Because of recurring trespass upon and illegal occupancy of Indian territory, a major purpose of these Acts as they developed was to protect the rights of Indians to their properties.  Among other things, non-Indians were prohibited from settling on tribal properties, and the use of force was authorized to remove persons who violated these restrictions.  The 1822 provision was part of this design;  and with only slight change in wording, it was incorporated in the 1834 consolidation of the various statutes dealing with Indian affairs.  Act of June 30, 1834, 4 Stat. 729.  Section 22 of that Act is now 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 194, already set out in this opinion. Although the word \"Indian\" in the second line of \u00a7 22 of the 1834 Act replaced the word \"Indians\" in the 1822 provision, there is no indication that any change in meaning was intended;  and none should be implied at this late date, particularly in light of 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, which provides that unless the context indicates otherwise, \"words importing the singular include and apply to several persons, parties, or things.\"\n\n\n24\nEven construed as including the plural, however, it is urged that the word \"Indians\" does not literally include an Indian tribe, and that it is plain from other provisions of the Act that Congress intended to distinguish between Indian tribes and individual Indians.  But as we see it, this proves too much.  At the time of the enactment of the predecessors of \u00a7 194, Indian land ownership was primarily tribal ownership;  aboriginal title, a possessory right, was recognized and was extinguishable only by agreement with the tribes with the consent of the United States. Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida, 414 U.S., at 669-670, 94 S.Ct., at 778.  Typically, this was accomplished by treaty between the United States and the tribe, and typically the land reserved or otherwise set aside was held in trust by the United States for the tribe itself.  \" 'Whatever title the Indians have is in the tribe, and not in the individuals, although held by the tribe for the common use and equal benefit of all the members.' \" United States v. Jim, 409 U.S. 80, 82, 93 S.Ct. 261, 263, 34 L.Ed.2d 282 (1972), quoting Cherokee Nation v. Hitchcock, 187 U.S. 294, 307, 23 S.Ct. 115, 119, 47 L.Ed. 183 (1902).  It is clear enough that, when enacted, Congress intended the 1822 and 1834 provisions to protect Indians from claims made by non-Indian squatters on their lands.  To limit the force of these provisions to lands held by individual Indians would be to drain them of all significance, given the historical fact that at the time of the enactment virtually all Indian land was tribally held.  Legislation dealing with Indian affairs \"cannot be interpreted in isolation but must be read in light of the common notions of the day and the assumptions of those who drafted [it].\" Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, 435 U.S. 191, 206, 98 S.Ct. 1011, 1019, 55 L.Ed.2d 209 (1978).  Furthermore, \" 'statutes passed for the benefit of dependent Indian tribes  . . .  are to be liberally construed, doubtful expressions being resolved in favor of the Indians.' \"   Bryan v. Itasca County, 426 U.S. 373, 392, 96 S.Ct. 2102, 2112, 48 L.Ed.2d 710 (1976), quoting Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. United States, 248 U.S 78, 89, 39 S.Ct. 40, 41, 63 L.Ed. 138 (1918).\n\n\n25\nThe second argument, presented in its most acute form by the State of Iowa, is that \u00a7 194 applies only where the Indians' antagonist is an individual white person and has no force at all where the adverse claimant is an artificial entity.16  We cannot accept this broad submission.  The word \"person\" for purposes of statutory construction, unless the context indicates to the contrary, is normally construed to include \"corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals.\"  1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1.  And in terms of the protective purposes of the Acts of which \u00a7 194 and its predecessors were a part, it would make little sense to construe the provision so that individuals, otherwise subject to its burdens, could escape its reach merely by incorporating and carrying on business as usual.  As we said in Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 687, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2034, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), \"by 1871, it was well understood that corporations should be treated as natural persons for virtually all purposes of constitutional and statutory analysis.\"17 It stands to reason that in re-enacting this provision in the Revised Statutes, now codified in the United States Code, Congress was fully aware that it would be interpreted to cover artificial entities as well as individuals.\n\n\n26\nIt nevertheless does not follow that the \"white persons\" to whom will be shifted the burden of proof in title litigation with Indians also include the sovereign States of the Union.  \"[I]n common usage, the term 'person' does not include the sovereign, [and] statutes employing the phrase are ordinarily construed to exclude it.\"  United States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U.S. 600, 604, 61 S.Ct. 742, 743, 85 L.Ed. 1071 (1941);  accord, United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U.S. 258, 275, 67 S.Ct. 677, 687, 91 L.Ed. 884 (1947).  Particularly is this true where the statute imposes a burden or limitation, as distinguished from conferring a benefit or advantage.  United States v. Knight, 39 U.S. 301, 315, 14 Pet. 301, 315, 10 L.Ed. 465 (1840).  There is nevertheless \"no hard and fast rule of exclusion,\" United States v. Cooper Corp., supra, 312 U.S., at 604-605, 61 S.Ct., at 743;  and much depends on the context, the subject matter, legislative history, and executive interpretation.  The legislative history here in uninformative, and executive interpretation is unhelpful with respect to this dormant statute.  But in terms of the purpose of the provision that of preventing and providing remedies against non-Indian squatters on Indian lands\u2014it is doubtful that Congress anticipated such threats from the States themselves or intended to handicap the States so as to offset the likelihood of unfair advantage. Indeed, the 1834 Act, which included \u00a7 22, the provision identical to the present \u00a7 194, was \"intended to apply to the whole Indian country, as defined in the first section.\"  H.R.Rep. No. 474, 23d Cong., 1st Sess., 10 (1834).  Section 1 defined Indian country as being \"all that part of the United States west of the Mississippi, and not within the states of Missouri and Louisiana, or the territory of Arkansas, and, also, that part of the United States east of the Mississippi River, and not within any state to which the Indian title has not been extinguished  . . . .\"  4 Stat. 729.  Although this definition was discarded in the Revised Statutes, see Rev.Stat. \u00a7 5596, it is apparent that in adopting \u00a7 22 Congress had in mind only disputes arising in Indian country, disputes that would not arise in or involve any of the States.\n\n\n27\nNor have we discovered anything since its passage or in connection with the definition of Indian country now contained in the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151, indicating that Congress intended the words \"white person\" in \u00a7 194 to include any of the original or any of the newly admitted States of the Union.  We hesitate, therefore, to hold that the State of Iowa must necessarily be disadvantaged by \u00a7 194 when litigating title to the property to which it claims ownership, particularly where its opposition is an organized Indian tribe litigating with the help of the United States of America.  It may well be that a State, like other litigants and like the State of Iowa did in this case, will often bear the burden of proof on various issues in litigating the title to real estate.  But \u00a7 194 operates regardless of the circumstances once the Tribe or its champion, the United States, has demonstrated that the Tribe was once in possession of or had title to the area under dispute.\n\n\n28\nPetitioners also defend the refusal of the District Court to apply \u00a7 194 on the grounds that a precondition to applying it is proof of prior possession or title in the Indians and that this involves the merits of the issue on which this case turns\u2014whether the changes in the river were avulsive or accretive.  We think the Court of Appeals had the better view of the statute in this regard.  Section 194 is triggered once the Tribe makes out a prima facie case of prior possession or title to the particular area under dispute.  The usual way of describing real property is by identifying an area on the surface of the earth through the use of natural or artificial monuments.  There seems to be no question here that the area within the Barrett survey was once riparian land lying on the west bank of the Missouri River and was long occupied by the Tribe as part of the reservation set apart for it in consequence of the treaty of 1854. This was enough, it seems to us, to bring \u00a7 194 into play.  Of course, that would not foreclose the State of Iowa from offering sufficient evidence to prove its own title or from prevailing on any affirmative defenses it may have.\n\n\n29\nPetitioners also assert that even if \u00a7 194 is operative and even if the Tribe has made out its prima facie case, only the burden of going forward with the evidence, and not the burden of persuasion, is shifted to the State.  Therefore they, the petitioners, should prevail if the evidence is in equipoise.  The term \"burden of proof\" may well be an ambiguous term connoting either the burden of going forward with the evidence, the burden of persuasion, or both.  But in view of the evident purpose of the statute and its use of the term \"presumption\" which the \"white man\" must overcome, we are in agreement with the two courts below that \u00a7 194 contemplates the non-Indian's shouldering the burden of persuasion as well as the burden of producing evidence once the tribe has made out its prima facie case of prior title or possession.\n\nIII\nA.\n\n30\nIn Oregon ex rel. State Land Board v. Corvallis Sand & Gravel Co., 429 U.S. 363, 97 S.Ct. 582, 50 L.Ed.2d 550 (1977), this Court held that, absent an overriding federal interest, the laws of the several States determine the ownership of the banks and shores of waterways.  This was expressive of the general rule with respect to the incidents of federal land grants:\n\n\n31\n\" 'We hold the true principle to be this, that whenever      the question in any Court, state or federal, is, whether a title to land which had once been the property of the United      States has passed, that question must be resolved by the laws      of the United States;  but that whenever, according to those      laws, the title shall have passed, then that property, like      all other property in the state, is subject to state      legislation;  so far as that legislation is consistent with      the admission that the title passed and vested according to      the laws of the United States.' \"  Id., at 377, 97 S.Ct., at      590, quoting Wilcox v. Jackson, 38 U.S. 498, 517, 13 Pet.      498, 517, 10 L.Ed. 264 (1839) (emphasis added by the      Corvallis Court).\n\n\n32\nThe Court's conclusion in the particular dispute before it in Corvallis was that state law governed the rights of the riparian owner because there was no claim of an applicable federal right other than the equal-footing origin of the State's title.\n\n\n33\nAs the Court of Appeals held, however, the general rule recognized by Corvallis does not oust federal law in this case. Here, we are not dealing with land titles merely derived from a federal grant, but with land with respect to which the United States has never yielded title or terminated its interest.  The area within the survey was part of land to which the Omahas had held aboriginal title and which was reserved by the Tribe and designated by the United States as a reservation and the Tribe's permanent home.  The United States continues to hold the reservation lands in trust for the Tribe and to recognize the Tribe pursuant to the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 984, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 461 et seq.\n\n\n34\nIn these circumstances, where the Government has never parted with title and its interest in the property continues, the Indians' right to the property depends on federal law, \"wholly apart from the application of state law principles which normally and separately protect a valid right of possession.\"  Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida, 414 U.S., at 677, 94 S.Ct., at 782.  It is rudimentary that \"Indian title is a matter of federal law and can be extinguished only with federal consent\" and that the termination of the protection that federal law, treaties, and statutes extend to Indian occupancy is \"exclusively the province of federal law.\"  Id., at 670, 94 S.Ct., at 779.  Insofar as the applicable law is concerned, therefore, the claims of the Omahas are \"clearly distinguishable from the claims of land grantees for whom the Federal Government has taken no such responsibility.\"   Id., at 684, 94 S.Ct., at 786 (REHNQUIST, J., concurring).  This is not a case where the United States has patented or otherwise granted lands to private owners in a manner that terminates its interest and subjects the grantees' incidents of ownership to determination by the applicable state law.  The issue here is whether the Tribe is no longer entitled to possession of an area that in the past was concededly part of the reservation as originally established. That question, under Oneida, is a matter for the federal law to decide.18\n\nB\n\n35\nAlthough we have determined that federal law ultimately controls the issue in this case, it is still true that \"[c]ontroversies  . . .  governed by federal law, do not inevitably require resort to uniform federal rules.  . . .  Whether to adopt state law or to fashion a nationwide federal rule is a matter of judicial policy 'dependent upon a variety of considerations always relevant to the nature of the specific governmental interests and to the effects upon them of applying state law.' \"  United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., 440 U.S. 715, 727-728, 99 S.Ct. 1448, 1458, 59 L.Ed.2d 711 (1979), quoting United States v. Standard Oil Co., 332 U.S. 301, 310, 67 S.Ct. 1604, 1609, 91 L.Ed. 2067 (1947).19  The Court of Appeals, noting the existence of a body of federal law necessarily developed by this Court in the course of adjudicating boundary disputes between States having their common border on a navigable stream, purported to find in those doctrines the legal standards to apply in deciding whether the changes in the course of the Missouri River involved in this case had been avulsive or accretive in nature.\n\n\n36\nThe federal law applied in boundary cases, however, does not necessarily furnish the appropriate rules to govern this case.  No dispute between Iowa and Nebraska as to their common border on or near the Missouri River is involved here.  The location of that border on the ground was settled by Compact in 1943 and by further litigation in this Court, Nebraska v. Iowa, 406 U.S. 117, 92 S.Ct. 1379, 31 L.Ed.2d 733 (1972).  The federal interest in this respect has thus been satisfied, except to the extent that the Compact itself may bear upon a dispute such as this.  United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., supra, advises that at this juncture we should consider whether there is need for a nationally uniform body of law to apply in situations comparable to this, whether application of state law would frustrate federal policy or functions, and the impact a federal rule might have on existing relationships under state law.  An application of these factors suggests to us that state law should be borrowed as the federal rule of decision here.\n\n\n37\nFirst, we perceive no need for a uniform national rule to determine whether changes in the course of a river affecting riparian land owned or possessed by the United States or by an Indian tribe have been avulsive or accretive.  For this purpose, we see little reason why federal interests should not be treated under the same rules of property that apply to private persons holding property in the same area by virtue of state, rather than federal, law.  It is true that States may differ among themselves with respect to the rules that will identify and distinguish between avulsions and accretions, but as long as the applicable standard is applied, evenhandedly to particular disputes, we discern no imperative need to develop a general body of federal common law to decide cases such as this, where an interstate boundary is not in dispute.  We should not accept \"generalized pleas for uniformity as substitutes for concrete evidence that adopting state law would adversely affect [federal interests].\" United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., supra, 440 U.S., at 730, 99 S.Ct., at 1459.\n\n\n38\nFurthermore, given equitable application of state law, there is little likelihood of injury to federal trust responsibilities or to tribal possessory interests.  On some occasions, Indian tribes may lose some land because of the application of a particular state rule of accretion and avulsion, but it is as likely on other occasions that the tribe will stand to gain.  The same would be the case under a federal rule, including the rule that the Court of Appeals announced in this case.  The United States fears a hostile and unfavorable treatment at the hands of state law, but, as we have said, the legal issues are federal and the federal courts will have jurisdiction to hear them.   Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida, 414 U.S. 661, 94 S.Ct. 772, 39 L.Ed.2d 73 (1974).  Adequate means are thus available to insure fair treatment of tribal and federal interests.\n\n\n39\nThis is also an area in which the States have substantial interest in having their own law resolve controversies such as these.  Private landowners rely on state real property law when purchasing real property, whether riparian land or not.  There is considerable merit in not having the reasonable expectations of these private landowners upset by the vagaries of being located adjacent to or across from Indian reservations or other property in which the United States has a substantial interest.  Borrowing state law will also avoid arriving at one answer to the avulsive-accretion riddle in disputes involving Indians on one side and possibly quite different answers with respect to neighboring land where non-Indians are the disputants.  Indeed, in this case several hundred acres of land within the Barrett survey are held in fee, and concededly are not Indian property.  These tracts would not be governed by the federal rule announced by the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n40\nWe have borrowed state law in Indian cases before.  In Board of Comm'rs v. United States, 308 U.S. 343, 60 S.Ct. 285, 84 L.Ed. 313 (1939), the question was what law, federal or state, would apply in a claim to recover taxes improperly levied by a political subdivision of a State upon Indians' trust lands.  The Court observed that \"[s]ince the origin of the right to be enforced is the Treaty, plainly whatever rule we fashion is ultimately attributable to the Constitution, treaties or statutes of the United States, and does not owe its authority to the law-making agencies of Kansas.\"  Id., at 349-350, 60 S.Ct., at 287-288.  The Court, nevertheless, elected to adopt state law as the federal rule of decision.  There was no reason in the circumstances of the case for the beneficiaries of federal rights to have a privileged position over other aggrieved taxpayers, and \"[t]o respect the law of interest prevailing in Kansas in no wise impinges upon the exemption which the Treaty of 1861 has commanded Kansas to respect and the federal courts to vindicate.\"20\n\n\n41\nThe importance of attending to state law, once an interstate boundary has been determined, is underlined by Arkansas v. Tennessee, 246 U.S. 158, 38 S.Ct. 301, 62 L.Ed. 638 (1918).  In that case, because the disputed boundary between Arkansas and Tennessee had been determined, the question of title to riparian land and to the river bottom was a matter to be determined by local law:\n\n\n42\n\"How the land that emerges on either side of an      interstate boundary stream shall be disposed of as between      public and private ownership is a matter to be determined      according to the law of each State, under the familiar      doctrine that it is for the States to establish for      themselves such rules of property as they deem expedient with      respect to the navigable waters within their borders and the riparian lands adjacent to them.  . . .  But these      dispositions are in each case limited by the interstate      boundary, and cannot be permitted to press back the boundary      line from where otherwise it should be located.\"   Id., at      175-176, 38 S.Ct., at 305.\n\n\n43\nLikewise, in the present case, the Compact of 1943 settled the location of the interstate boundary, within and without the river;  and the question of land ownership within or adjacent to the river is best settled by reference to local law even where Indian trust land, a creature of the federal law, is involved.\n\nC\n\n44\nThe passage quoted above from Arkansas v. Tennessee was quoted with approval in Nebraska v. Iowa, 406 U.S., at 126-127, 92 S.Ct., at 1385, where the central question was the interpretation of the Interstate Compact determining the location of the entire border between Nebraska and Iowa.21  Our opinion in Nebraska v. Iowa is also instructive with respect to which state law, Iowa or Nebraska, the federal court should refer to in determining the federal standard applicable to this case.\n\n\n45\nUnder \u00a7 2 of the Compact, each State ceded to the other and relinquished jurisdiction over all lands within the Compact boundary of the other State.  Under \u00a7 3, \"Titles, mortgages, and other liens\" affecting such lands that are \"good in\" the ceding State \"shall be good in\" the other State.22 Thus, ceded lands east of the Compact line came under Iowa jurisdiction;  but Iowa was obligated to respect title to any ceded land east of the new boundary if that title was \"good in\" Nebraska.  Accepting the Special Master's recommendations in this respect, the Court ruled that one claiming a Nebraska title to land east of the Compact line need show only \"good title\" under Nebraska law and need not also prove either the location of the original boundary between the two States or that the land at issue was on the Nebraska side of that original boundary.  The Court further ruled, in agreement with the Special Master, that in litigating with private claimants seeking to prove good Nebraska title to land east of the Compact line, the State of Iowa was disentitled to rely on certain doctrines of Iowa common law bearing on riparian land ownership.23\n\n\n46\nIn this case, the District Court ruled that even though the United States and an Indian tribe rather than private parties were plaintiffs, title to the Barrett survey land, which was once in Nebraska but is now unquestionably in Iowa, should be governed by Nebraska law in accordance with the terms of the Compact. Proceeding to adjudicate the case in accordance with Nebraska law, the District Judge found that the Tribe and the Government, respondents here, had failed to prove that the Blackbird Bend area had been separated from the rest of the reservation by avulsive changes in the Missouri River and that the defendants, petitioners here, without the aid of any presumption of accretion available under Iowa law if applicable, had instead proved that the river changes had been accretion. In the course of arriving at this conclusion, the District Court, relying on Nebraska cases, rejected the Government's definition of avulsion, later embraced by the Court of Appeals, as contrary to the common law of Nebraska. The defendants, petitioners here, having carried the burden of proving their good title to the land at issue, were entitled to a decree quieting title in them.\n\n\n47\nAlthough we have already held that the District Court erred in concluding that determination of titles to reservations lands is not a matter for the federal law, we have also indicated that the federal law should incorporate the applicable state property law to resolve the dispute. Therefore, it seems to us that the District court reached the correct result in ruling that under the construction of the Compact in Nebraska v. Iowa, Nebraska law should be applied in determining whether the changes in the river that moved the Blackbird Bend area from Nebraska to Iowa had been avulsive or accretive. It should also be noted that the District Court, although wrong in wholly rejecting the applicability of \u00a7 194, concluded as a matter of fact and law that the defendants, petitioners here, had carried the burden of persuasion normally incumbent upon a plaintiff in a quiet-title action, and had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the reservation lands had eroded and had accreted to the Iowa shoreline. Apparently for this reason, the trial judge observed at the end of his memorandum opinion that were he wrong in refusing to apply \u00a7 194, his findings and conclusions \"would not be altered by any different allocation of the burden of persuasion.\" 433 F. Supp., at 67.\n\nIV\n\n48\nIn sum, the Court of Appeals was partially correct in ruling that \u00a7 194 was applicable in this case. By its terms, \u00a7 194 applies to the private petitions but not to petitioner State of Iowa. We also agree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that federal law governed the substantive aspects of the dispute, but find it in error for arriving at a federal standard, independent of state law, to determine whether there had been an avulsion or an accretion. Instead, the court should have incorporated the law of the State that otherwise would have been applicable which, as we have said, is the law of Nebraska. Of course, because of its view of the controlling law, the Court of Appeals did not consider whether the District Court had correctly interpreted Nebraska law and had properly applied it to the facts of this case. These tasks are still to be performed, and we vacate the Court of Appeals' judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n49\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n50\nMr. Justice POWELL took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\n\n51\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring.\n\n\n52\nI join the Court's opinion, but I write briefly to add a comment about my views as to the scope of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 194.\n\n\n53\nSection 194 applies to a property dispute between an Indian and a \"white person.\" The property dispute here is between Indians, on the one hand, and, on the other, nine individuals, two corporations, and the State of Iowa. See 575 F.2d 620, 622 (CA8 1978). The Court holds that \"white person\" includes an artificial entity and thus that \u00a7 194 applies in the dispute between the Omahas and the two corporate petitioners. Ante, at 666-667. Contrariwise, the Court holds that \"white person\" does not include a sovereign State, and thus that \u00a7 194 does not apply in the dispute between the Omahas and petitioner State of Iowa. Ante, at 667-668, 678. The court, however, does not expressly discuss \u00a7 194's applicability to the nine individual claimants.\n\n\n54\nSince the Court nevertheless holds that \"\u00a7 194 applies to the private petitioners\" without exception, ante, at 678, it must be proceeding on one of two assumptions. The Court could assume, first, that all nine individual petitioners are Caucasians, and hence each literally is a \"white person\" under \u00a7 194. There is no evidence in the record, however, as to the race of these individuals. See Brief for Petitioners in No. 78-160, p. 30; Brief for United States 32 n. 25; Tr. of Oral Arg. 13. Since the burden of proving the factual predicate for \u00a7 194's applicability presumably rests on the Indians who seek to invoke it, the Court, in holding \u00a7 194 applicable to the individual petitioners here, could not properly rely on this first possible assumption.\n\n\n55\nThe Court could assume, second, that \"white person\" in \u00a7 194 refers, not to a Caucasian, but to a \"non-Indian\" individual. On this assumption, the race of the individual petitioners (so long as they are not Indians) would be irrelevant in determining \u00a7 194's applicability. That this is in fact the assumption the Court makes is suggested by its decision to ignore the adjective \"white\" in holding each of the corporate petitioners to be a \"white person,\" and by its refusal to follow United States v. Perryman, 100 U.S. 235 (1880), where it was held that \"white person,\" as used in another section of the Non-Intercourse Act, did not include a Negro. Ante, at 666 n. 16.\n\n\n56\nThe Court seems to hold implicitly, therefore, that \"white person\" in \u00a7 194 includes any \"non-Indian\" individual. I would prefer to make this holding explicit. In my view, any other construction of \u00a7 194 would raise serious constitutional questions. To construe \u00a7 194 as applicable to disputes between Indians and Caucasians, but not to disputes between Indians and black or oriental individuals, would create an irrational racial classification highly questionable under the Fifth Amendment's equal protection guarantee. To avoid this result, \u00a7 194's reference to a \"white person\" must be read to mean any \"non-Indian\" individual or entity, and I so interpret the Court's holding today. To the extent that Perryman is inconsistent with this reading, I must regard that case as overruled sub silentio.\n\n\n\n1\n In Heckman v. United States, 224 U.S. 413, 32 S.Ct. 424, 56 L.Ed. 820 (1912), the Court explained the source and nature of this trust relationship.  In the exercise of its plenary authority over Indian affairs, Congress has the power to place restrictions on the alienation of Indian lands.  Where it does so, it continues guardianship over Indian lands and \"[d]uring the continuance of this guardianship, the right and duty of the Nation to enforce by all appropriate means the restrictions designed for the security of the Indians cannot be gainsaid.  . . .  A transfer of the [Indian land] is not simply a violation of the proprietary rights of the Indian.  It violates the governmental rights of the United States.\"  Id., at 437-438, 32 S.Ct. at 431-432.  Accordingly, the United States is entitled to go into court as trustee to enforce Indian land rights.  \"It [is] not essential that it should have a pecuniary interest in the controversy.\"  Id., at 439, 32 S.Ct., at 432.  See also Morrison v. Work, 266 U.S. 481, 485, 45 S.Ct. 149, 151, 69 L.Ed. 394 (1925);  Choate v. Trapp, 224 U.S. 665, 678, 32 S.Ct. 565, 570, 56 L.Ed. 941 (1912);  F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 94-96 (1942).\n\n\n2\n The State of Iowa claims title to certain lands deeded to it by quitclaim and to the bed of the Missouri between the thalweg (see n. 3, infra ) and the ordinary high-water mark, any islands formed in that portion of the river, and any abandoned channels. The latter claims are based upon the equal-footing doctrine, see Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan, 44 U.S. 212, 3 How. 212, 11 L.Ed. 565 (1845), and the 1943 Boundary Compact between Iowa and Nebraska, see n. 6, infra.\n\n\n3\n The term is commonplace in boundary disputes between riparian States.  See, e. g., Minnesota v. Wisconsin, 252 U.S. 273, 282, 40 S.Ct. 313, 319, 64 L.Ed. 558 (1920):\n\"The doctrine of Thalweg, a modification of the more ancient principle which required equal division of territory, was adopted in order to preserve to each State equality of right in the beneficial use of the stream as a means of communication. Accordingly, the middle of the principal channel of navigation is commonly accepted as the boundary.  Equality in the beneficial use often would be defeated, rather than promoted, by fixing the boundary on a given line merely because it connects points of greatest depth.  Deepest water and the principal navigable channel are not necessarily the same.  The rule has direct reference to actual or probable use in the ordinary course, and common experience shows that vessels do not follow a narrow crooked channel close to shore, however deep when they can proceed on a safer and more direct one with sufficient water.\"\n\n\n4\n Treaty of Mar. 6, 1865, 14 Stat. 667;  Act of June 22, 1874, 18 Stat. 146, 170;  Act of Aug. 7, 1882, 22 Stat. 341;  see also Act of Mar. 3, 1885, 23 Stat. 362, 370, as amended by Act of Jan. 7, 1925, ch. 34, 43 Stat. 726.\n\n\n5\n There is some dispute over whether the Barrett survey actually marked the reservation boundary because several years had passed since the Tribe began occupying the reservation and the Missouri may have changed its course during that period.  See United States v. Wilson, 433 F.Supp. 67, 69, 74 (ND Iowa 1977). This does not appear to be of significance in this litigation. Id., at 75.\n\n\n6\n In Nebraska v. Iowa, 143 U.S. 359, 12 S.Ct. 396, 36 L.Ed. 186 (1892), the Court decided a boundary dispute between the States of Nebraska and Iowa caused by the wanderings of the Missouri.  \"[T]he fickle Missouri River,\" however, \"refused to be bound by the  . . .  decree,\" Eriksson, The Boundaries of Iowa, 25 Iowa J. of Hist. and Pol. 163, 234 (1927);  and in 1943 Nebraska and Iowa entered into a Compact fixing the boundary between the States independent of the river's location.  Congress ratified the Compact in the Act of July 12, 1943, ch. 220, 57 Stat. 494.  Since the time of the Compact, the Army Corps of Engineers has been largely successful in taming the river.  See Nebraska v. Iowa, 406 U.S. 117, 119, 92 S.Ct. 1379, 1381, 31 L.Ed.2d 733 (1972).\n\n\n7\n The District Court stated the common-law rule, 433 F.Supp. 57, 62 (1977):\n\"Simply stated, when a river which forms a boundary between two parcels of land moves by processes of erosion and accretion, the boundary follows the movements of the river.  Independent Stock Farm v. Stevens, 128 Neb. 619, 259 N.W. 647 (1935).  On the other hand, when a river which forms a boundary between two parcels of land abruptly moves from its old channel to a new channel through an event known as avulsion, the boundary remains defined by the old river channel.  Iowa Railroad Land Co. v. Coulthard, 96 Neb. 607, 148 N.W. 328 (1914).  The jurisdiction of Nebraska applies these principles to the movements of the Missouri River.  DeLong v. Olsen, 63 Neb. 327, 88 N.W. 512 (1901).\"\nThis Court has followed the same principles resolving boundary disputes between States bordering on navigable streams. Arkansas v. Tennessee, 246 U.S. 158, 173, 38 S.Ct. 301, 304, 62 L.Ed. 638 (1918);  Missouri v. Nebraska, 196 U.S. 23, 34-36, 25 S.Ct. 155, 157, 49 L.Ed. 372 (1904);  Nebraska v. Iowa, 143 U.S., at 360-361, 370, 12 S.Ct., at 396, 397, 400.\n\n\n8\n The District Court relied on Mason v. United States, 260 U.S. 545, 43 S.Ct. 200, 67 L.Ed. 396 (1923);  Francis v. Francis, 203 U.S. 233, 27 S.Ct. 129, 51 L.Ed. 165 (1906);  and Fontenelle v. Omaha Tribe of Nebraska, 298 F.Supp. 855 (Neb.1969), aff'd 430 F.2d 143 (CA8 1970).\n\n\n9\n The District Court also suggested that the possessory interest of the Tribe was not of sufficient quality to trigger the burden shifting contemplated by 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 194.\n\n\n10\n The District Court construed the Court's decision in Nebraska v. Iowa, 406 U.S. 117, 92 S.Ct. 1379, 31 L.Ed.2d 733 (1972), as requiring the application of Nebraska law with respect to changes in the river that occurred before 1943, the date of the Iowa-Nebraska Compact that permanently fixed the boundary between the States, because the land at issue here was indisputably part of Nebraska before the river changed its course.  433 F.Supp., at 60, and n. 2.\n\n\n11\n Although the District Court hewed closely to Nebraska case law, it also observed that insofar as the relevant definitions of avulsion and accretion were concerned, there was no significant difference between Iowa and Nebraska law, except that under Iowa law accretion was presumed, which was not the case under Nebraska law.  Because Nebraska law would not aid the defendants by a presumption of accretion, the Tribe was favored by the application of Nebraska law.  The District Court was also of the view that the federal accretion-avulsion law was not substantially different.  As we shall see, the Court of Appeals differed with the District Court in this respect.\n\n\n12\n The Court of Appeals relied on two cases, Veatch v. White, 23 F.2d 69 (CA9 1927), and Uhlhorn v. United States Gypsum Co., 366 F.2d 211 (CA8 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 1026, 87 S.Ct. 753, 17 L.Ed.2d 674 (1967), in concluding that, under federal law, \"the sudden, perceptible change of the channel, whether within or without the river's original bed, is a critical factor in defining an avulsion.\"  575 F.2d 620, 637 (CA8 1978). This definition was broader than the Nebraska rule as understood and applied by the District Court, which the Court of Appeals described as follows:  \"an avulsion occurs only where a sudden shift in a channel cuts off land 'so that after the shift it remains identifiable as land which existed before the change of the channel and which never became a part of the river bed.' \" Id., at 634, quoting 433 F.Supp., at 73.  As is evident, the definition employed by the Court of Appeals permits a finding of avulsion even where the river is still largely within its original bed.\n\n\n13\n In No. 78-161, filed by the State of Iowa and its Conservation Commission, the questions on which certiorari was granted were stated as follows:\n\"Whether the State of Iowa is 'a white person', and the Omaha Indian Tribe is 'an Indian' within the meaning of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 194.\n*          *          *          *          *\n\"Whether federal law requires divestiture of Iowa's apparent good title to real property located within its boundaries.\"\nIn No. 78-160, we granted certiorari on the following questions:\n\"Whether the Eighth Circuit erroneously construed Title 25 U.S.Code \u00a7 194 to make it applicable in this case.\n\"Whether the Eighth Circuit erred in holding that Federal and not state common law with regard to accretion and avulsion is applicable in this case.\"\n\n\n14\n Of these various arguments, only the single ground relied on by the District Court in refusing to apply \u00a7 194 was discussed and rejected by the Court of Appeals.  The other grounds for holding \u00a7 194 inapplicable to this case were presented by petitioners either in their briefs on the merits before the Court of Appeals or their petition for rehearing before that court after it reversed the District Court.\n\n\n15\n The background, history, and development of these laws and Acts are explored exhaustively in F. Prucha, American Indian Policy in the Formative Years:  The Indian Trade and Intercourse Acts 1790-1834 (1962).  See also Cohen, supra n. 1, at 68-75.\n\n\n16\n Petitioners cite United States v. Perryman, 100 U.S. 235, 25 L.Ed. 645 (1880), as support for their position that \u00a7 194 must be construed literally to apply only to a \"white person,\" or individual Caucasian.  But that case dealt with another provision of the 1834 Nonintercourse Act, \u00a7 16, and there were distinct grounds in the legislative history indicating that the term \"white person\" as used in \u00a7 16 did not include a Negro.  Whether Perryman would be followed today is a question we need not decide.\n\n\n17\n There were two corporate defendants among the parties in the District Court.  They filed a separate petition for certiorari, No. 78-162, RGP, Inc. v. Omaha Indian Tribe, but no action has yet been taken on it.  Under our Rules, however, the two corporations are party-respondents in the cases in which we have granted certiorari.  Rule 21(4).\n\n\n18\n Petitioners claim that Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U.S. 574, 42 S.Ct. 406, 66 L.Ed. 771 (1922), mandates the applicability of state rather than federal law in this case.  But there the United States issued patents granting former reservation lands.  The Court merely held that, absent contrary evidence, when the United States conveyed and completely parted with its territory, even though Indian land, it intended the incidents of the resulting ownership to be determined by state law.  This is no more than the general rule that Oneida recognized.  In the present case, of course, the area at issue was never conveyed away by the United States or by the Tribe and is claimed by the United States and the Tribe to remain as part of the reservation established as the result of the treaty of 1854.  Neither do we find that United States v. Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co., 318 U.S. 206, 63 S.Ct. 534, 87 L.Ed. 716 (1943), presents a contrary holding.  There, the Court refused to construe a federal statute permitting the Secretary of the Interior to grant permission for the opening of highways over Indian land \"in accordance with the laws of the state\" as prohibiting the establishment of a power line in the highway right-of-way without further federal consent.  Id., at 208, 63 S.Ct., at 535.  As we understand that case, the Court held only that the consent authorized by the federal statute included the uses which such consent would authorize under state law.\n\n\n19\n Compare P. Bator, P. Mishkin, D. Shapiro, & H. Wechsler, Hart and Wechsler's, The Federal Courts and the Federal System 768 (2d ed. 1973):\n\"The federal 'command' to incorporate state law may be a judicial rather than a legislative command;  that is, it may be determined as a matter of choice of law, even in the absence of statutory command or implication, that, although federal law should 'govern' a given question, state law furnishes an appropriate and convenient measure of the content of this federal law.\"\n\n\n20\n See Board of Comm'rs v. United States, 308 U.S., at 351-352, 60 S.Ct., at 288-289:\n\"Having left the matter at large for judicial determination within the framework of familiar remedies equitable in their nature, see Stone v. White, 301 U.S. 532, 534, 57 S.Ct. 851, 852, 81 L.Ed. 1265, Congress has left us free to take into account appropriate considerations of 'public convenience.'  Cf. Virginian Ry. Co. v. Federation, 300 U.S. 515, 552, 57 S.Ct. 592, 601, 81 L.Ed. 789.  Nothing seems to us more appropriate than due regard for local institutions and local interests.  We are concerned with the interplay between the rights of Indians under federal guardianship and the local repercussion of those rights.  Congress has not been heedless of the interests of the states in which Indian lands were situated, as reflected by their local laws. See, e. g., \u00a7 5 of the General Allotment Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 388, 389.  With reference to other federal rights, the state law has been absorbed, as it were, as the governing federal rule not because state law was the source of the right but because recognition of state interests was not deemed inconsistent with federal policy.  See Brown v. United States, 263 U.S. 78, 44 S.Ct. 92, 68 L.Ed. 171;  Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. United States, 261 U.S. 299, 43 S.Ct. 354, 67 L.Ed. 664.  In the absence of explicit legislative policy cutting across state interests, we draw upon a general principle that the beneficiaries of federal rights are not to have a privileged position over other aggrieved tax-payers in their relation with the states or their political subdivisions. To respect the law of interest prevailing in Kansas in no wise impinges upon the exemption which the Treaty of 1861 has commanded Kansas to respect and the federal courts to vindicate.\"\n\n\n21\n The Special Master in that case observed that, although it would be difficult, the location of the agreed-upon boundary in the Compact could be determined with reasonable accuracy.  Report of Special Master in Nebraska v. Iowa, O.T.1964, No. 17 Orig., p. 50.\n\n\n22\n See 1943 Iowa Acts, ch. 306,, as ratified by Act of July 12, 1943, ch. 220, 56 Stat. 494:\n\"Sec. 2. The State of Iowa hereby cedes to the State of Nebraska and relinquishes jurisdiction over all lands now in Iowa but lying westerly of said boundary line and contiguous to lands in Nebraska.\n\"Sec. 3. Titles, mortgages, and other liens good in Nebraska shall be good in Iowa as to any lands Nebraska may cede to Iowa and any pending suits or actions concerning said lands may be prosecuted to final judgment in Nebraska and such judgments shall be accorded full force and effect in Iowa.\"\n\n\n23\n Under this ruling, Iowa was disentitled, either as plaintiff or defendant, from invoking its presumption that changes in the Missouri had been accretive rather than avulsive, and could not rely on its rule that no person can claim adversely against the sovereign State of Iowa. Thus, a title based on adverse possession good under Nebraska law would be good in Iowa. Report of  Special Master, supra, at 174-175.\n\n\n","label":1}

Cooper, for respondent.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner, a native and national of Canada, filed a petition for naturalization under the provisions of \u00a7 310(b) of the Nationality Act of 1940, 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) \u00a7 710(b), now 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1430. On April 18, 1962, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a final order denying the petition on the ground that petitioner had failed to establish his attachment to the United States Constitution. Twelve days later, on April 30, 1962, petitioner served notice on the Immigration and Naturalization Service that he would appear before the trial judge on May 2, 1962, with post-trial motions 'to amend certain findings of fact pursuant to Rule 52 F.R.C.P. and for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59 F.R.C.P.' The Government raised no objection as to the timeliness of these motions, and the trial court specifically declared that the 'motion for a new trial' was made 'in ample time.' On October 16, 1962, these motions were denied. On December 6, 1962, within 60 days of the denial of the post-trial motions but not within 60 days of the original entry of judgment by the District Court, petitioner filed a notice of appeal. The Government then moved in the Court of Appeals to dismiss the appeal on the ground that notice of appeal had not been filed within the 60-day period prescribed by Rule 73(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and that petitioner's post-trial motions were untimely and hence did not toll the running of the time for appeal. The Court of Appeals granted the motions. Petitioner now seeks review by certiorari of the dismissal of his appeal.\n\n\n2\nRule 73(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure designates 'the time within which an appeal may be taken' in this type of case as '60 days' from 'the entry of the judgment appealed from * * *.' The Rule also declares that:\n\n\n3\n'the full time for appeal fixed in this subdivision commences      to run and is to be computed from the entry of any of the      following orders made upon a timely motion under such rules:      * * * granting or denying a motion under Rule 52(b) to amend      or make additional findings of fact * * *; or granting or      denying a motion under Rule 59 to alter or amend the      judgment; or denying a motion for a new trial under Rule 59.'      (Emphasis added.) It is clear that if petitioner's post-trial motions were 'timely,' then the appeal, which was filed within 60 days of the disposition of the motions, was timely. The Government alleges, however, that the post-trial motions were not timely since the applicable rules provide that they must be 'served not later than 10 days after the entry of the judgment,' and these motions were served 12 days after the entry of judgment. The Government concludes, therefore, that since there was no 'timely motion' under the rules designated in Rule 73(a), the appeal must be, but was not, filed within 60 days of the entry of the original judgment.\n\n\n4\nAlthough petitioner admits that the post-trial motions were not served until 12 days after the entry of judgment, he claims that they should be deemed timely since they were served 10 days 'from receipt of notice of entry of the judgment' by his lawyers who were not in court on the day the judgment was entered. He claims, moreover, that he relied on the Government's failure to raise a claim of untimeliness when the motions were filed and on the District Court's explicit statement that the motion for a new trial was made 'in ample time'; for if any question had been raised about the timeliness of the motions at that juncture, petitioner could have, and presumably would have, filed the appeal within 60 days of the entry of the original judgment, rather than waiting, as he did, until after the trial court had disposed of the post-trial motions.\n\n\n5\nIn a recent case involving a closely related issue, we recognized 'the obvious great hardship to a party who relies upon the trial judge's finding of 'excusable neglect' prior to the expiration of the (applicable period for filing an appeal) and then suffers reversal of the finding * * *' after the time for filing the appeal has expired. Harris Truck Lines, Inc., v. Cherry Meat Packers, Inc., 371 U.S. 215, 217, 83 S.Ct. 283, 285, 9 L.Ed.2d 261. In that case petitioner had, within the applicable period for filing his appeal, received from the trial court a 30-day extension on the time for filing his appeal on the ground of 'excusable neglect based on a failure of a party to learn of the entry of the judgment.' Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 73(a). Petitioner then filed his appeal within the period of the extension but beyond the original period. The Court of Appeals, concluding that there had been no 'excusable neglect' within the meaning of Rule 73(a), held that the District Court had erred in granting the extension and dismissed the appeal. We reversed the dismissal and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals 'so that petitioner's appeal may be heard on its merits.'\n\n\n6\nIbid. See also Lieberman v. Gulf Oil Corp., 2 Cir., 315 F.2d 403, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 823, 84 S.Ct. 62, 11 L.Ed.2d 56.\n\n\n7\nThe instant cause fits squarely within the letter and spirit of Harris. Here, as there, petitioner did an act which, if properly done, postponed the deadline for the filing of his appeal. Here, as there, the District Court concluded that the act had been properly done. Here, as there, the petitioner relied on the statement of the District Court and filed the appeal within the assumedly new deadline but beyond the old deadline. And here, as there, the Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court had erred and dismissed the appeal. Accordingly, in view of these 'unique circumstances,' Harris Truck Lines, Inc., v. Cherry Meat Packers, Inc., supra, 371 U.S. at 217, 83 S.Ct. at 285, 9 L.Ed.2d 261, we grant the writ of certiorari, vacate the judgment, and remand the case to the Court of Appeals so that petitioner's appeal may be heard on the merits. It is so ordered.\n\n\n8\nJudgment vacated and case remanded to the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n9\nMr. Justice CLARK, with whom Mr. Justice HARLAN, Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice WHITE join, dissenting.\n\n\n10\nI agree with the Court of Appeals that it did not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal on the merits.\n\n\n11\nPetitioner's motions 'to amend certain findings of fact pursuant to Rule 52 F.R.C.P. and for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59 F.R.C.P.' were not timely filed, as they were not served until the 12th day after entry of judgment and not filed until the 14th day. The rules are phrased in mandatory terms:\n\n\n12\n'Rule 52(b): 'Upon motion of a party made not later than 10      days after entry of judgment the court may amend its findings      * * *.'\n\n\n13\n'Rule 59(b): 'A motion for a new trial shall be served not      later than 10 days after the entry of the judgment.'\n\n\n14\nRule 59(e): 'A motion to alter or amend the judgment shall be      served not later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.'      (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n15\nRule 6(b) specifically says that the court 'may not extend the time for taking any action under rules * * * 52(b), 59(b), (d) and (e) * * * and 73(a) * * * except to the extent and under the conditions stated in them.' These requirements are mandatory and cannot be enlarged by the court or by the parties. None of these rules provides for any extension of time except 73(a), which authorizes, 'upon a showing of excusable neglect based on a failure of a party to learn of the entry of the judgment,' an extension of the time for appeal 'not exceeding 30 days from the expiration of the original time herein prescribed.' Petitioner has made no claim under this provision of Rule 73(a) in the District Court, the Court of Appeals or in the 'questions presented' here. The running of the time for appeal is terminated by the filing of a timely motion under Rule 52 or Rule 59. But here petitioner contends that the trial court's statement that the motions were 'in ample time,' considered together with the Government's acquiescence, was sufficient to effect such termination. Whether the trial judge's statement was spontaneous or made by agreement is not shown by the record and is of no legal significance. The rules specifically say that motions to amend the findings and for new trial must be made within 10 days and that this time shall not be extended.\n\n\n16\nIn the light of these facts I cannot say that this case 'fits squarely within the letter and spirit' of Harris Truck Lines, Inc. v. Cherry Meat Packers, Inc., 371 U.S. 215, 83 S.Ct. 283, 9 L.Ed.2d 261 (1962). As I read the facts in the two cases, Harris Lines does not touch the problem here. In that case the District Court, after denying a timely motion for a new trial, granted an application under Rule 73(a) based on 'excusable neglect' to enlarge the time for appeal. The trial court had jurisdiction and 'properly entertained the motion * * * before the initial 30 days allowed for docketing the appeal had elapsed.' 371 U.S. at 216, 83 S.Ct. at 285, 9 L.Ed.2d 261. We said that a finding of 'excusable neglect' by a motions judge was entitled to 'great deference by the reviewing court' in the light of the 'obvious great hardship to a party who relies upon the trial judge's finding.' 371 U.S. at 217, 83 S.Ct. at 285, 9 L.Ed.2d 261. Finally, we said that the showing of 'excusable neglect' was of 'unique circumstances sufficient that the Court of  ppeals ought not to have disturbed the motion judge's ruling.' Ibid. That is a far cry from this case where the trial court had no jurisdiction to pass upon the untimely motions to amend the findings and for a new trial. To escape this, the Court either reads into the rules, contrary to the specific prohibition of 6(b), authorization for the District Court to enlarge the time for filing such motions, or treats the motions as being within the provisions of Rule 73(a), despite failure to allege any 'excusable neglect.' By thus authorizing the trial judge to entertain the motions it thereby extends the time for appeal. And, as I have said, the error of the trial judge in entertaining the motions could not be validated by the acquiescence of the Government. It is elementary that the parties cannot confer jurisdiction on the court.\n\n\n17\nWe have said that untimely motions to amend the findings and for new trial are of no legal significance whatsoever because the limiting language of Rule 6(b) is 'mandatory and jurisdictional and (can)not be extended regardless of excuse.' United States v. Robinson, 361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 288, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960). In my view we should abide by these rules or amend them, rather than emasculate them.\n\n\n18\nRules of procedure are a necessary part of an orderly system of justice. Their efficacy, however, depends upon the willingness of the courts to enforce them according to their terms. Changes in rules whose inflexibility has turned out to work hardship should be effected by the process of amendment, not by ad hoc relaxations by this Court in particular cases. Such dispensations in the long run actually produce mischievous results, undermining the certainty of the rules and causing confusion among the lower courts and the bar. Cf. Lieberman v.

Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 723 726, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2079\u20142081, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), is to be given retroactive effect. For the reasons that follow we hold today that this decision is nonretroactive.\n\n\n2\n* Respondent, Leroy Payne, pleaded guilty in a county circuit court in Michigan to a charge of assault with intent to commit murder in connection with an armed attack upon two sheriff's deputies. In March 1963 he was sentenced to a prison term of from 19 to 40 years. Several years later, respondent's conviction and sentence were set aside when a hearing, ordered by the Michigan Court of Appeals, disclosed that his confession and subsequent guilty plea were involuntary. Following a retrial, at which he exercised his rights to trial by jury and to plead innocent, respondent again was found guilty on the same assault charge. On August 30, 1967, he was resentenced to prison from 25 to 50 years with full credit for all time served under the prior sentence. During the resentencing hearing, the judge explained that the higher sentence was 'based on the nature of the crime and on the impressions which I formed of (respondent) and of the crime.'\n\n\n3\nRespondent appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals, which affirmed his conviction was approved the higher sentence. 18 Mich.App. 42, 170 N.W.2d 523 (1969). While the case was pending before the Michigan Supreme Court, the trial judge who had presided over respondent's second trial was requested to submit an affidavit detailing his reasons for imposing a higher sentence. The judge's affidavit stated that his sentencing determination was based primarily on (i) has personal belief that respondent's attitude since the first sentencing proceeding had changed from one of regret to remorselessness, (ii) his view that respondent's alibi defense, given under oath, was a 'tissue of lies,' and (iii) his heightened opportunity to learn of the details of the crime during the three-day trial.1\n\n\n4\nThe Michigan Supreme Court, in a 4-to-3 decision, upheld the conviction but rejected the higher sentence as violative of the due process restrictions established in North Carolina v. Pearce, supra. 386 Mich. 84, 191 N.W.2d 375 (1971). The court recognized that this Court had not yet decided whether Pearce applied to resentencing proceedings which, as in this case, occurred prior to Pearce's date of decision.2 While declining to predict how the retroactivity question would ultimately be resolved, the Michigan Supreme Court decided to apply Pearce to the case then before it 'pending clarification' by this Court. Id., at 90 n. 3, 191 N.W.2d, at 378 n. 2. Before this Court, the State contends that Pearce should not be applied retrospectively, but that, even if applicable, the state supreme court erred in holding the higher sentence invalid under the Pearce test. Because we hold today that Pearce does not apply retroactively, we do not reach the State's second contention.3\n\nII\n\n5\nIn Pearce, the Court emphasized that '(i)t can hardly be doubted' that, while 'there exists no absolute constitutional bar to the imposition of a more severe sentence upon retrial,' it would be entirely impermissible for judges to render harsher penalties as punishment for those defendants who have succeeded in getting their convictions reversed. 395 U.S., at 723, 89 S.Ct., at 2079. '(V) indictiveness' against a defendant for having exercised his rights to appeal or to attack his conviction collaterally, the Court held, 'must play no part in the sentence (a defendant) receives after a new trial.' Id., at 725, 89 S.Ct., at 2080. In so holding, the Court recognized that 'fundamental notions of fairness embodied within the concept of due process' absolutely preclude the imposition of sentences based upon such a \"retaliatory motivation.\" Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U.S. 17, at 25, 93 S.Ct. 1977, at 1982, 36 L.Ed.2d 714. No 'new' constitutional rule was thereby established and it cannot be questioned that this basic due process protection anticulated in Pearce is available equalty to defendants resentenced before and after the date of decision in that case. On this point the parties do not disagree.\n\n\n6\nThe dispute in this case centers, instead, around the 'prophylactic'4 limitations Pearce established to guard against the possibility of vindictiveness in the resentencing process. Those limitations, applicable 'whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial,' 395 U.S., at 726, 89 S.Ct., at 2081, require that the sentencing judge's reasons 'must affirmatively appear,' and that those reasons 'must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.' Ibid. The question here is whether these restrictions govern resentencing proceedings predating Pearce.\n\n\n7\nThe contours of the retroactivity inquiry have been clearly delineated in numerous decisions over the last decade. The test utilized repeatedly by this Court to ascertain whether 'new' constitutional protections in the area of criminal procedure are to be applied retroactively calls for the consideration of three criteria: '(a) the purpose to be served by the new standards, (b) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards.' Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 297, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 1970, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967). See also Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 629, 636, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 1737, 1741, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965); Tehan v. Shott, 382 U.S. 406, 410\u2014418, 86 S.Ct. 459, 461\u2014466, 15 L.Ed.2d 453 (1966); Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 726\u2014727, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 1777 1778, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966).\n\n\n8\nThe two purposes for the resentencing restrictions imposed by Pearce were to ensure (i) 'that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction . . . (would) play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial . . .' and (ii) that apprehension of such vindictiveness would not 'deter a defendant's exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his first conviction. . . .' 395 U.S., at 725, 89 S.Ct., at 2080; Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U.S. 104, 116, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 1960, 32 L.Ed.2d 584 (1972). The latter purpose is not pertinent to this case, since respondent was not deterred from exercising his right to challenge his first conviction. But, in any event, we think it clear that this function of the new resentencing rules could be served only in futuro: nothing in Pearce suggests that the Court contemplated that its decision might provide a ground for the untimely reopening of appeals by defendants who decided not to appeal prior to the date of decision in Pearce.5 See James v. Copinger, 441 F.2d 23 (CA4 1971).\n\n\n9\nThe first-articulated purpose of the Pearce rules\u2014to protect against the possibility that actual vindictiveness will infect a resentencing proceeding\u2014deserves closer scrutiny. Unlike the purposes underlying many of the decisions heretofore accorded retrospective application,6 this purpose does not implicate the \"fair determination' of . . . guilt or innocence.' Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 294, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 1922, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1968) (emphasis supplied). It does, however, involve questions touching on the 'integrity' of one aspect of the judicial process. McConnell v. Rhay, 393 U.S. 2, 3, 89 S.Ct. 32, 33, 21 L.Ed.2d 2 (1968). The Pearce restrictions serve to ensure that resentencing decisions will not be based on improper considerations, such as a judge's unarticulated resentment at having been reversed on appeal, or his subjective institutional interest in discouraging meritless appeals. By eliminating the possibility that these factors might occasion enhanced sentences, the Pearce prophylactic rules assist in guaranteeing the propriety of the sentencing phase of the criminal process. In this protective role, Pearce is analogous to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), in which the Court established rules to govern police practices during custodial interrogations in order to safeguard the rights of the accused and to assure the reliability of statements made during those interrogations. Thus, the prophylactic rules in Pearce and Miranda are similar in that each was designed to preserve the integrity of a phase of the criminal process. Because of this similarity, we find that Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966), which held Miranda nonretroactive, provides considerable guidance here. See also Jenkins v. Delaware, 395 U.S. 213, 89 S.Ct. 1677, 23 L.Ed.2d 253 (1969).\n\n\n10\nIt is an inherent attribute of prophylactic constitutional rules, such as those established in Miranda and Pearce, that their retrospective application will occasion windfall benefits for some defendants who have suffered no constitutional deprivation. Miranda's well-known warning requirements provided a protection 'against the possibility of unreliable statements in every instance of incustody interrogation,' and thereby covered many 'situations in which the danger (was) not necessarily as great as when the accused is subjected to overt and obvious coercion.' Johnson v. New Jersey, supra, 384 U.S., at 730, 86 S.Ct. at 1779 (emphasis supplied). Thus, had Miranda been applied retroactively, it would have required the reversal of many convictions in which no serious constitutional violation had occurred. Id., at 731, 86 S.Ct. at 1779. Likewise, the retroactive application of Pearce would require the repudiation of many sentences rendered under circumstances in which there was no genuine possibility that vindictiveness played a role. Judicial impropriety in the resentencing process, albeit intolerable wherever it happens, surely is not a common practice. Indeed, nothing in Pearce intimates that the Court regarded it as anything more than an infrequently appearing blemish on the sentencing process.7 Absent countervailing considerations rooted in the purposes underlying a new rule, this factor\u2014that retroactive application of such broadly protective rules would occasion reversals in many instances in which no actual prejudice has been suffered\u2014points toward a ruling of prospectivity.\n\n\n11\nNonretroactivity is also suggested by the second similarity between Miranda and Pearce. While each created a protective umbrella serving to enhance a constitutional guarantee, neither conferred a constitutional right that had not existed prior to those decisions. The right against use of an involuntary confession long preceded Miranda just as the right to be free from fundamentally unfair sentencing considerations predated Pearce. Supra, at 50. Because these foundational rights remain available to defendants in pre-Miranda and pre-Pearce cases, a decision of nonretroactivity is less likely to result in the continued incarceration of those whose convictions or sentences rest on unconstitutional acts.8 Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S., at 640, 85 S.Ct., at 1743 (Black, J., dissenting).\n\n\n12\nOf course, the question of the impact of particular decisions on the reliability and fairness of any aspect of a criminal proceeding is inherently a matter of balancing 'probabilities.' Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S., at 729, 86 S.Ct., at 1778; Adams v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 278, 281, 92 S.Ct. 916, 918, 31 L.Ed.2d 202 (1972). Yet in view of the fact that, if retroactive, Pearce would apply to innumerable cases in which no hint of vindictiveness appears, coupled with the consideration that due process claims may always be made in those prior cases in which some evidence of retaliatory motivation exists,9 we have little doubt that the 'probabilities' in this case preponderate in favor of a ruling of nonretroactivity.10\n\n\n13\nAlthough the remaining factors\u2014reliance and burden on the administration of justice\u2014have been regarded as having controlling significance 'only when the purpose of the rule in question did not clearly favor either retroactivity or prospectivity,' Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 251, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 1035, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969), those considerations also support the nonretroactivity of Pearce. The result in Pearce was not 'foreshadowed' by any prior decision of this Court.11 Indeed, prior to Pearce, resentencing judges were bound by no requirement that they articulate their reasons and generally enjoyed a wide discretion in terms of the factors they might legitimately consider. See Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949). Nor could it be said that the Court's decision was clearly forecast by any trend of lower court decisions. In Pearce itself the Court noted that lower federal and state courts were divided on all of the questions posed. 395 U.S., at 715 n. 5, 89 S.Ct., at 2075. Under these circumstances, judicial reliance on prior law was certainly justifiable.12\n\n\n14\nBecause of that reliance, it is fair to assume that in prior years few, if any, judges complied during resentencing with Pearce's recordation requirement, and that they often considered a variety of factors relating to the defendant and his crime which might or might not have fallen within the Pearce standard. We have been presented with no statistical indications as to how many persons received increased penalties after retrials.13 We cannot say, however, that the potential interference with the administration of justice would be insubstantial if Pearce were applied retroactively. In order to comply with Pearce, a resentencing judge\u2014assuming he is still on the bench or otherwise available\u2014would be required to make a factual determination as to the reasons for sentences he may have meted out years in the past. Compliance with that requirement would present considerable difficulties, since judges, like witnesses in criminal trials, lack infallible memories and perfect records of their motivations.14 Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S., at 637, 85 S.Ct., at 1742. While we would not shy from imposing these burdens were we persuaded that it was necessary to do so in order to effectuate the purposes underlying Pearce, we have found no such need here. In sum, upon application of the three-part test, we hold that the Pearce requirements are not to be accorded retroactive application.15\n\nIII\n\n15\nSince the resentencing hearing in this case took place approximately two years before Pearce was decided, we hold that the Michigan Supreme Court erred in applying its proscriptions here. Accordingly, the judgment of that court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n16\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n17\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n18\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\n\n19\nWe deal here with the guarantee contained in the Fifth Amendment, applicable to the States by reason of the Fourteenth, Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707, that no person shall 'be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.' The construction given that clause was applied retroactively in North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656; and I think that Payne as well as Pearce should have the benefit of the 'new' constitutional rule. My views have been at odds with those of the Court as witnessed by the dissent of Mr. Justice Black in Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 640, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 1743, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 which I joined, and by my separate dissent in Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 255, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 1037, 22 L.Ed.2d 248. I could understand making a 'new' constitutional rule applicable only prospectively. But I cannot bring myself to making the 'new' rule applicable to some but not to others. If a State has violated the Federal Constitution in convicting or sentencing a prisoner, I see no way of denying him relief from that unconstitutional trial or unconstitutional sentence.\n\n\n20\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause in my view was designed to discourage the abusive use by the Executive and Judicial Branches of the awesome power of government over the individual. Jeopardy attaches once the trial starts. If there is error in that trial and as a result a new trial is had, the Government cannot impose an added or increased sentence on the second trial. That is my view, as explained in North Carolina v. Pearce, supra, 395 U.S., at 726\u2014737, 89 S.Ct., at 2081\u20142082. Respondent received a sentence of 19 to 40 years on his first trial and a greater one of 25 to 50 years on his second trial. I therefore would affirm the judgment below.\n\n\n21\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, dissenting.\n\n\n22\nThe Court today holds that no limitations need be placed on resentencings that occurred before the date of decision in North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969). I believe however, that the State has an obligation to present to the court reviewing the second conviction evidence from which that court can determine whether a new sentence, more severe than that imposed at a prior trial, resulted in part from the sentencing authority's desire to punish the defendant for successfully appealing his first conviction.1 I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n\n23\n* This case raises the issue of retroactivity only because of the almost unbelievable sluggishness of the appellate process in Michigan. Payne's second sentence was imposed on August 30, 1967, nearly two years before Pearce was decided. However, the Michigan Court of Appeals did not decide Payne's appeal until July 28, 1969, one month after the decision in Pearce. The Michigan Supreme Court considered the case for two more years, finally deciding it on November 9, 1971. Had the appellate process in Michigan been at all expeditious, this Court might have used Payne's case as the vehicle to decide that harsher sentences on reconviction could be justified only by objective evidence of post-sentencing conduct by the defendant, the rule adopted in Pearce. The only difference between Pearce's case and Payne's, then, is that the former moved up to this Court more quickly than the latter. Different treatment of two cases is justified under our Constitution only when the cases differ in some respect relevant to the different treatment.2 And a difference in the speed with which a judicial system disposes of an appeal is not related in any way to the purposes served by the limitations that Pearce placed on resentencing. Thus, considerations of fairness rooted in the Constitution lead me to conclude that cases in the pipeline when a new constitutional rule is announced must be given the benefit of that rule.\n\n\n24\nThe rule adopted by the Court today is curious in another way. The Court appears to say that a defendant who failed to appeal his first conviction out of 'a reasonably based fear of actual vindictiveness,' ante, at 52 n. 5, is entitled to review of his conviction. Cf. Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 396\u2014397, n. 3, 83 S.Ct. 822, 825\u2014826, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963).3 If his appeal is successful, his new trial will occur after the date of decision in Pearce. Thus, any new sentence will be subject to the limitations imposed by Pearce. The rather strange result is that someone like Payne, who adhered to state procedural rules for vindicating his right to an error-free trial, may receive an enhanced sentence without limitation, while someone who did not adhere to those rules may not have his sentence increased unless the requirements of Pearce are met. I suppose that anomalies are occasionally inevitable, but I submit that we should consider very carefully any rule of retroactivity that has the effect of penalizing compliance with state procedural rules.\n\nII\n\n25\nThe Court applies the now-familiar three-pronged test to determine whether Pearce should be given retroactive effect, and it reaches the now-familiar result of nonretroactivity.4 I believe that principled adjudication requires the Court to abandon the charade of carefully balancing countervailing considerations when deciding the question of retroactivity. Inspecting the cases dealing with retroactivity, I find that they appear to fall into three groups. In some cases, this Court has held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction in the traditional sense. See, e.g., Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969); Waller v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387, 90 S.Ct. 1184, 25 L.Ed.2d 435 (1970). Those holdings have been made fully retroactive. Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970); Robinson v. Neil, 409 U.S. 505, 93 S.Ct. 876, 35 L.Ed.2d 29 (1973). Cf. United States v. United States Coin & Currency, 401 U.S. 715, 91 S.Ct. 1041, 28 L.Ed.2d 434 (1971). In other cases the Court announced a rule that was central to the process of determining guilt or innocence, and whose application might well have led to the acquittal of the defendant. See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963); In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). Those holdings too have been given retroactive effect. Pickelsimer v. Wainwright, 375 U.S. 2, 84 S.Ct. 80, 11 L.Ed.2d 41 (1963); Ivan V. v. New York, 407 U.S. 203, 92 S.Ct. 1951, 32 L.Ed.2d 659 (1972). Cf. Adams v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 278, 92 S.Ct. 916, 31 L.Ed.2d 202 (1972). All other constitutional rules of criminal procedure have been given prospective effect only.5\n\n\n26\nI confess that I have been unable to discover a principled basis for that threefold classification, but it does appear to be the factor operating in our cases. And I see little point in forcing lower courts to flounder without substantial guidance in the morass of our cases, by informing them that they are to apply a balancing test, when in fact it invariably occurs that the balancing test results in holdings of nonretroactivity. Furthermore, it demeans this Court to pretend to consider a variety of factors if, no matter how those factors are arrayed, the result is predetermined. An open-minded examination of this Court's cases on retroactivity compels the conclusion that the Court divides cases into several classes, and it is the classification, not the three-pronged test, that determines the result. Our time would be better spent, I think, in attempting to delineate the basis for those classifications, and to derive them from some constitutional principles, rather than in 'applying' a balancing test. Indeed, it might have been thought that Robinson v. Neil, supra, had begun the task of rationalizing our cases, but apparently that is not so.\n\nIII\n\n27\nThe holding of Pearce is a simple one: the Due Process Clause requires States to adopt procedures designed to minimize the possibility that a new sentence after a successful appeal will be based in part on vindictiveness for the defendant's having taken the appeal. The Court agrees that 'this basic due process protection . . . is available equally to defendants resentenced before and after the date of decision in that case.' Ante, at 50, 51. The question then is what procedures are required to insure that that protection has been afforded defendants resentenced before Pearce was decided. This question, like many of those involving retroactivity, relates to the integrity of the judicial process, not to the limitations placed by the Constitution on police behavior. One can agree that the precise requirements of Pearce are inappropriate for retrospective application largely because they are procedurally ill-adapted to the problem, yet disagree with the Court that the States need do nothing at all to convince a reviewing court that vindictiveness played no part in the resentencing. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Allen, 443 Pa. 96, 102, 277 A.2d 803 (1971).\n\n\n28\nThe issue need not be framed as the 'retroactivity' of Pearce. The problem, as I see it, is to devise procedures that will permit reviewing courts to determine whether the requirements of the Due Process Clause have been met. In Pearce we concluded that it would be enough for a judge, on resentencing a defendant, to state his reasons for imposing a more severe sentence. If the more severe sentence was based upon objective information, placed on the record, concerning the conduct of the defendant after the first sentencing, the more severe sentence was permissible. Such a rule, although not absolutely guaranteeing that vindictiveness will play no part,6 nonetheless substantially reduces the possibility that it will, without significantly interfering with the judge's lawful discretion.\n\n\n29\nA rather similar procedure would accomplish the same result for defendants resentenced before Pearce was decided. If a defendant did receive a harsher sentence after a successful appeal, and he seeks to have it reduced to the original sentence, the State should be required to present evidence that the new sentence was based on post-sentence conduct. In the absence of such evidence, the sentence must be reduced.7 The Court suggests that such a procedure would 'occasion windfall benefits for some defendants who have suffered no constitutional deprivaton.' Ante, at 53. That assertion must be considered more closely.\n\n\n30\nAs the Court notes, there is little evidence that more severe sentences are offen imposed. It cites an informal survey suggesting that 12% of reconvicted defendants receive higher sentences. Ante, at 56 n. 13. Even if that estimate is only half as large as the actual figure for pre-Pearce cases, still there are clearly very few defendants who have received harsher sentences. With respect to many of them, it will not be difficult to produce evidence supporting the new sentence. As in Moon v. Maryland, 398 U.S. 319, 90 S.Ct. 1730, 26 L.Ed.2d 262 (1970), and Odom v. United States, 400 U.S. 23, 91 S.Ct. 112, 27 L.Ed.2d 122 (1970), the sentencing judge might indicate by affidavit or order the grounds for his sentencing decision. If memories have faded, the State might show that a presentence report considered by the judge recited post-sentence conduct by the defendant that would justify the harsher sentence.\n\n\n31\nThus, I do not think that it can fairly be said that the requirements I would impose would in fact result in windfall benefits to 'innumerable' defendants, ante, at 55; they would accrue to those few defendants who were convicted, successfully appealed, were reconvicted, and receiver harsher sentences so long ago that the State cannot produce evidence from which a reviewing court could find that vindictiveness played no part in the sentencing decision.8 And the 'windfall benefits' would impair no substantial state interest in incarcerating those few offenders. Unlike the suppression of probative evidence that might severely limit the State's ability to secure a conviction of a person who undoubtedly committed an offense, here the remedy is simply the reduction of sentence. North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244, 247, 92 S.Ct. 402, 404, 30 L.Ed.2d 413 (1971). The sentence to be served would be one that had already been found appropriate by one judge, and would therefore satisfy the various interests advanced by incarceration.9\n\n\n32\nFor these reasons, I dissent.\n\n\n33\nMr. Justice STEWART joins Part III of this opinion.\n\n\n\n1\n In his affidavit, the second sentencing judge indicated that a different judge who presided over respondent's prior guilty plea and sentencing hearings did not have as good an opportunity to become fully informed of the details of the 'deliberate, cold-blooded attack.' In a subsequent amendatory affidavit filed by the same judge, he corrected his prior affidavit by stating that the first judge did have 'some limited opportunity to see and hear (respondent) when he testified as a witness for the prosecution against his accomplice' in a separate trial. The parties in this case now agree that the first judge did preside over the trial of respondent's codefendant before sentencing respondent and that respondent did testify at that trial. The parties continue, however, to dispute whether that opportunity was as complete as the opportunity afforded the second judge, and, if not, whether this is a permissible consideration in resentencing under Pearce. Because of the manner in which we dispose of this case, we need not resolve this controversy. See n. 3, infra.\n\n\n2\n This Court has twice previously granted certiorari to resolve this question, but on each occasion the writ was dismissed as improvidently granted. Moon v. Maryland, 398 U.S. 319, 90 S.Ct. 1730, 26 L.Ed.2d 262 (1970) (cert. granted, 395 U.S. 975, 89 S.Ct. 2135, 23 L.Ed.2d 764 (1969)); Odom v. United States, 400 U.S. 23, 91 S.Ct. 112, 27 L.Ed.2d 122 (1970) (cert. granted, 399 U.S. 904, 90 S.Ct. 2203, 26 L.Ed.2d 559 (1970)).\n\n\n3\n This Court has consistently declined to reach out to resolve unsettled questions regarding the scope or meaning of decisions establishing 'new' constitutional requirements in cases in which it holds any such decisions nonretroactive. See Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967) (holding United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), and Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967), nonretroactive without resolving the question whether those cases were applicable to preformal accusation confrontations, a question later decided in Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 32 L.Ed.2d 411 (1972)); DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U.S. 631, 88 S.Ct. 2093, 20 L.Ed.2d 1308 (1968) (holding Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968), and Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194, 88 S.Ct. 1477, 20 L.Ed.2d 522 (1968), nonretroactive and declining to decide whether a summary contempt proceeding that results in a one-year sentence is a 'serious' offense requiring trial by jury, a question later decided in Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. 66, 90 S.Ct. 1886, 26 L.Ed.2d 437 (1970)); Carcerano v. Gladden (a companion case with DeStefano, in which the Court declined to decide whether the right to jury trial contemplated by Duncan also required a unanimous verdict, a question later decided in Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404, 92 S.Ct. 1628, 32 L.Ed.2d 184 (1972)); Elkanich v. United States (a companion case with Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 28 L.Ed.2d 388 (1971), holding Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969), nonretroactive and declining to decide whether the search was otherwise compatible with the Chimel limitations on searches incident to lawful arrests).\n\n\n4\n Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, supra, 412 U.S., at 25, 93 S.Ct., at 1982; Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U.S. 104, 116, 118, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 1960, 1961, 32 L.Ed.2d 584 (1972).\n\n\n5\n This is not to suggest, of course, that there may not be specific cases in which a convicted defendant might show that his initial waiver of his right to appeal was involuntary because caused by a reasonably based fear of actual vindictiveness on the part of a particular judge. Cf. North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S., at 725 n. 20, 89 S.Ct., at 2080.\n\n\n6\n See, e.g., In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970) (held retroactive in Ivan V. v. New York, 407 U.S. 203, 92 S.Ct. 1951, 32 L.Ed.2d 659 (1972); Barber v. Page, 390 U.S. 719, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 20 L.Ed.2d 255 (1968) (held retroactive in Berger v. California, 393 U.S. 314, 89 S.Ct. 540, 21 L.Ed.2d 508 (1969)); Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968) (held retroactive in Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1968)); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963).\n\n\n7\n The most that may be said is that the Court in Pearce found that 'increased sentences on reconviction are far from rare,' 395 U.S., at 725 n. 20, 89 S.Ct., at 2080, and that it was persuaded that vindictiveness played a role in a sufficient number of those cases to 'warrant the imposition of a prophylactic rule.' Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U.S., at 116, 92 S.Ct., at 1960.\n\n\n8\n See Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966). See also Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S., at 299, 87 S.Ct., at 299 (in pre-Wade-Gilbert cases 'it remains open to all persons to allege and prove . . . that the confrontation . . . infringed his right to due process of law'); cf. Halliday v. United States, 394 U.S. 831, 833, 89 S.Ct. 1498, 1499, 23 L.Ed.2d 16 (1969).\n\n\n9\n Of course, it remains true that 'retaliatory motivation' may be 'difficult to prove in any individual case.' North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S., at 725 n. 20, 89 S.Ct., at 2080. And, this is certainly one of the reasons why the Court in Pearce adopted prophylactic rules. Similar problems of proof prompted the decisions in Miranda and Wade, but such problems in themselves were not sufficient to warrant retrospective application.\n\n\n10\n We reiterate here what the Court has repeatedly said in retroactivity cases: '(W)e do not disparage a constitutional guarantee in any manner by declining to apply it retroactively.' Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S., at 728, 86 S.Ct., at 1778; cf. Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 629, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 1737, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965).\n\n\n11\n Compare Berger v. California, 393 U.S. 314, 89 S.Ct. 540, 21 L.Ed.2d 508 (1969), and Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1968), with Adams v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 278, 92 S.Ct. 916, 31 L.Ed.2d 202 (1972), and Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S., at 731, 86 S.Ct., at 1779.\n\n\n12\n We need not disagree with Mr. Justice MARSHALL'S notation, post, at 66 n. 9, that the result in Pearce was foreshadowed, i.e., that higher sentences on retrial were being questioned. Our focus here, however, is on the prophylactic measure adopted to achieve that result. As to this, we do not think there is any serious question that neither the recordation requirement nor the limitations on matters to be considered were so clearly forecast as to render a contrary state reliance unjustifiable.\n\n\n13\n See Note, Constitutional Law: Increased Sentence and Denial of Credit on Retrial Sustained under Traditional Waiver Theory, 1965 Duke L.J. 395, 399 n. 25 (informal survey of North Carolina courts showed that six of 50 reconvicted defendants received higher sentences).\n\n\n14\n Thus, the retroactivity of Pearce would present difficulties not encountered in two of the Court's recent decisions holding retroactive cases involving resentencing: Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972) (the 'death penalty' case); Robinson v. Neil, 409 U.S. 505, 93 S.Ct. 876, 35 L.Ed.2d 29 (1973) (holding Waller v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387, 90 S.Ct. 1184, 25 L.Ed.2d 435 (1970) retroactive). In both cases, '(t)hat which was constitutionally invalid could be isolated and excised without requiring the State to begin the entire factfinding process anew.' Robinson v. Neil, supra, at 510, 93 S.Ct., at 879.\n\n\n15\n Respondent, relying on Linkletter v. Walker, supra, and Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott, 382 U.S. 406, 86 S.Ct. 459, 15 L.Ed.2d 453 (1966), urges the Court to distinguish between cases, like his, on direct appeal and those arising after a conviction and sentence have become final. We think the above-stated reasons for applying Pearce prospectively apply with equal force to all cases in which resentencing proceedings occurred before June 23, 1969, the date of decision in Pearce. See Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S., at 300, 87 S.Ct., at 300; Desist v. United States, 394 U.S., at 252, 89 S.Ct., at 1035; Williams v. United States, 401 U.S., at 651\u2014652, 91 S.Ct., at 1151\u20141152.\n\n\n1\n The State did present an affidavit from the sentencing judge in this case. The Michigan Supreme Court held that it did not satisfy the requirement of North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 726, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2081, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), that more severe sentences can be justified only by 'objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.' See 386 Mich. 84, 97, 191 N.W.2d 375, 381 (1971). Petitioner contends that this holding was erroneous. Petition for Writ of Certiorari 5\u20146. The Court does not address this contention, nor shall I.\n\n\n2\n Since Payne's appeal was pending when Pearce was decided, I need not consider whether different considerations, such as the defendant's failure to raise the issue in seeking review from this Court or to persuade us on the merits, might suffice under the Due Process Clause to justify different treatment of defendants whose sentences had become final.\n\n\n3\n Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting in Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 475, 83 S.Ct. 822, 867, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963), suggested that the possibility of an enhanced sentence after a successful appeal, according to the Court, precluded the State from relying on a failure to appeal as an adequate state ground supporting the denial of relief under federal habeas corpus. On his interpretation, then, Fay anticipated the holding in Pearce.\n\n\n4\n In holding various rulings retroactive, this Court has given only the most cursory nod to the three-pronged test. See, e.g., Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1968); McConnell v. Rhay, 393 U.S. 2, 89 S.Ct. 32, 21 L.Ed.2d 2 (1968); Arsenault v. Massachusetts, 393 U.S. 5, 89 S.Ct. 35, 21 L.Ed.2d 5 (1968).\n\n\n5\n Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965), giving a limited retroactive effect to Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), is an anomaly at odds with the Court's subsequent treatment of problems of retroactivity and can be explained only by the Court's unfamiliarity with those problems when the case was decided. See also Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966).\n\n\n6\n For example, the sentencing judge, had he considered the case as an initial matter, might have imposed a sentence shorter than that imposed at the first trial, but, out of vindictiveness, he might decide to reimpose the original sentence. The procedures outlined in Pearce cannot prevent this.\n\n\n7\n I assume that the Court's reliance on the continuing availability of the 'foundational' right means that an offender who shows that vindictiveness played a part in his resentencing is entitled to relief I would simply shift the burden of proof to the State, which has better access to the relevant facts.\n\n\n8\n State courts, closer to the problems of administering the rule I suggest, have widely thought that those burdens are not substantial. See, e.g., Stonom v. Wainwright, 235 So.2d 545 (Fla.App.1970); People v. Baze, 43 Ill.2d 298, 253 N.E.2d 392 (1969); State v. Pilcher, 171 N.W.2d 251 (Iowa 1969); Hord v. Commonwealth, 450 S.W.2d 530 (Ky.1970); State v. Rentschler, 444 S.W.2d 453 (Mo.1969); Commonwealth v. Allen, 443 Pa. 96, 277 A.2d 803 (1971); Denny v. State, 47 Wis.2d 541, 178 N.W.2d 38 (1970).\n\n\n9\n The Court's conclusion that Pearce was not foreshadowed by decisions in this Court or by a trend of lower court decisions is somewhat misleading. This Court's decision in Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957), raised substantial questions under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the constitutionality of enhanced sentences after a successful appeal. Also, one reading of Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 337 (1963), suggested by the dissent of Mr. Justice Harlan, is that a State may not burden the right to appeal with the possibility of an enhanced sentence. And prior to Pearce, the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Circuits had held that enhanced sentences after re-conviction could be justified only in limited circumstances. See Marano v. United States, 374 F.2d 583 (CA1 1967); United States v. Coke, 404 F.2d 836 (CA2 1968) (en banc); Patton v. North Carolina, 381 F.2d 636 (CA4 1967); Simpson v. Rice, 396 F.2d 499 (CA5 1968); United States v. White, 382 F.2d 445 (CA7 1967). So had the California Supreme Court, in a powerful opinion by Justice Traynor. People v. Henderson, 60 Cal.2d 482, 35 Cal.Rptr. 77, 386 P.2d 677 (1963). Finally, a 'learned and effective article,' as Judge Friendly called it in United States v. Coke, supra, arguing the same point, appeared in 1965. Van Alstyne, In Gideon's Wake: Harsher Penalties and the 'Successful' Criminal Appellant, 74 Yale L.J. 606 (1965). I would think that these decisions and commentary had prepared the ground rather well for Pearce, as the Court concedes, ante, at 56 n. 12. Yet if the result was foreshadowed, it is not unreasonable to require States now to supplement the record, so that it will be clear that unconstitutional sentences were not imposed. Because it insists on treating the issue here as a question of retroactivity, the Court does not address this argument.\n\n\n","label":0}

Pp. 251\u2014257.\n161 Conn. 337, 288 A.2d 58, affirmed.\nJames A. Wade, Hartford, Conn., for petitioner; and\nJohn D. LaBelle, Manchester, Conn., for respondent.\nMr. Justice BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nOn May 16, 1967, petitioner, on advice of counsel, pleaded guilty in the Superior Court of Hartford County, Connecticut, to charges of narcotics violation and larceny of goods. On June 16, 1967, before being sentenced, he informed the court that he had retained new counsel and desired to withdraw his plea and stand trial. The court refused to permit him to withdraw his plea and sentenced him to a term of five to 10 years on the narcotics charge and to a term of two years on the larceny charge. The Connecticut Supreme Court affirmed this conviction on his direct appeal challenging the voluntariness of his plea, State v. Dukes, 157 Conn. 498, 255 A.2d 614 (1969), and the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut denied his application for federal habeas corpus relief sought in Civil Action No. 13029. He then brought this state habeas corpus action in the Superior Court for Hartford County, and attacked the voluntariness of his plea under the Federal Constitution on a ground not raised either on his direct appeal or in his action for federal habeas corpus relief. He alleged that a conflict of interest arising from his lawyer's representation of two girls with whom petitioner had been charged in an unrelated false pretenses case was known to the judge who sentenced him and rendered his plea involuntary and unintelligent. After a full hearing, the Superior Court denied relief. The Supreme Court of Connecticut affirmed, 161 Conn. 337, 288 A.2d 58 (1971). The Supreme Court stated that, although the petition for state habeas relief alleged that the guilty plea was not voluntary and intelligent on several grounds, '(o)n appeal, however, (petitioner) has asserted in essence only that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, which rendered his plea involuntary . . ..' 161 Conn., at 339, 288 A.2d at, 60. We granted certiorari. 404 U.S. 937, 92 S.Ct. 293, 30 L.Ed.2d 249 (1971).\n\n\n2\nThe two girls were represented by Mr. Zaccagnino of the firm of Zaccagnino, Linardos, & Delaney in the false pretenses case, and petitioner by another lawyer, when petitioner retained the firm to defend him in the narcotics and larceny case. There were also charges pending against petitioner in New Haven and Fairfield counties. He also faced the possibility of prosecution as a second offender, having been convicted in state court in 1961 of breaking and entry and assault.\n\n\n3\nPetitioner, accompanied by Mr. Zaccagnino, appeared on May 9, 1967, to plead to the narcotics and larceny charges. The lawyer advised him to plead guilty if a plea bargain could be negotiated whereby the State's Attorney would consolidate all outstanding charges in and out of Hartford County and agree not to prosecute petitioner as a second offender, but to recommend a sentence of five to 10 years on the narcotics charge, two years on the larceny charge, and concurrent sentences on all the other charges. Under Conn.Gen. Stat.Rev. \u00a7 54\u201417a (1958) the New Haven County and Fairfield County charges would be transferred to Hartford County for disposition only if the State's Attorneys of the counties consented and petitioner pleaded guilty to the charges. When petitioner refused to accept this advice, Mr. Zaccagnino asked the court to be relieved as petitioner's counsel. The court denied the request but accepted petitioner's plea of not guilty and continued the trial to the next day so that petitioner might try to retain another lawyer. As petitioner went to the corridor outside the courtroom, however, Hartford police officers arrested him on still another charge. Petitioner attempted suicide at the police station to which he was taken and was hospitalized for several days. Accordingly the trial date was postponed to May 16.\n\n\n4\nPetitioner did not engage new counsel but appeared for trial on May 16 represented by Mr. Delaney, partner of Mr. Zaccagnino who was engaged in another court. Petitioner now showed interest in a plea bargain, and Mr. Delaney and the State's Attorney engaged in negotiations, which were interrupted from time to time while Mr. Delaney consulted with petitioner. A plea bargain on the terms Mr. Zaccagnino had urged petitioner on May 9 to accept was finally struck, and petitioner withdrew his notguilty plea and entered the guilty plea he now attacks. The State's Attorney had misgivings because of petitioner's expressed dissatisfaction with Mr. Zaccagnino the week before, and the following occurred:\n\n\n5\n'(State's Attorney): . . . The record also ought to appear      that Mr. Delaney is here with him today and he is in the      office of Mr. Zaccagnino. I think the Court might inquire with respect to the representation      since there had been some indication that counsel had asked      to withdraw the other day.\n\n\n6\n'The Court: Well now, Mr. Dukes, I want to be sure that      everything is in order here. . . . Now I want, now Mr.      Delaney is here, are you fully satisfied with the services he      is rendering you, Mr. Dukes?\n\n\n7\n'The Accused: Yes, sir.\n\n\n8\n'The Court: You are. And now you know of course, Mr. Dukes,      that\u2014you know of course that the State of Connecticut has the      burden of proving you guilty on the charge and you are free      to go to trial but you still wish to change your plea, is      that correct?\n\n\n9\n'The Accused: Yes, sir.\n\n\n10\n'The Court: And do you do this of your own free will, Mr.      Dukes?\n\n\n11\n'The Accused: Yes, sir.\n\n\n12\n'The Court: And you know the probable consequences of it?\n\n\n13\n'The Accused: Yes, sir.\n\n\n14\n'The Court: Very well, and no one has induced you to do this,      influenced you one way or the other? You are doing this of      your own free will?\n\n\n15\n'The Accused: Yes.\n\n\n16\n'The Court: Very well then. We will accept the change of      plea.'\n\n\n17\nThe court set June 2, 1967, for sentencing petitioner. But the documents transferring the New Haven County and Fairfield County charges had not arrived, and the presentence report had not been completed, on that day, and the date was therefore continued to June 16, 1967. By coincidence, however, the judge's calendar for June 2 also listed the case of the two girls who, on Mr. Zaccagnino's advice, had pleaded guilty to the false pretenses charges and were to be sentenced. That proceeding did not involve petitioner because the disposition of the charges as to him was part of the plea bargain. In urging leniency for the two girls, Mr. Zaccagnino made statements putting the blame on petitioner for the girls' plight. These statements are the primary basis of petitioner's claim of divided loyalty on the part of Mr. Zaccagnino that he alleges rendered his guilty plea of May 16 involuntary and unintelligent. Mr. Zaccagnino said:\n\n\n18\n'(B)oth of them came under the influence of Charles Dukes.      Now how they could get in a position to come under the      influence of somebody like him, if Your Honor pleases,      creates the problem here that I think is the cause of the      whole situation.\n\n\n19\n'Both these girls left their homes, came under the influence      of Dukes and got involved. I think, Your Honor, though, that      the one thing . . . that should stand in their good stead, as      a result of their willingness to cooperate with the State      Police they capitulated Dukes into making a plea. I think,      Your Honor, since I was on both sides of the case, having      been on the other side on the other case I can tell Your      Honor that it was these girls that because of their refusal .      . . to cooperate with Dukes and to testify against him that      capitulated him into taking a plea on which he will shortly      be removed from society . . ..'\n\n\n20\nMr. Zaccagnino appeared on June 16 to represent petitioner in the proceedings to complete the plea bargain. He was surprised to be told by petitioner that petitioner had obtained new counsel and intended to withdraw his guilty plea and stand trial. It appears from petitioner's cross-examination at the state habeas hearing that he had learned on June 2 of Mr. Zaccagnino's statements about him when the girls were sentenced.1 Yet he did not tell Mr. Zaccagnino that this was why he was changing lawyers, nor did he tell the court that this was why he wanted to withdraw his plea. When pressed by the court to give a reason, he answered, 'At the time I pleaded, I just came out of the hospital, I think it was a day, and I was unconscious for three days, and I didn't realize at the time actually what I was pleading to.'2 His explanation for wanting another lawyer was that he thought an out-of-town lawyer would give him better service: 'I would rather have an attorney out of town for certain reasons of the case.' The court refused to permit petitioner to withdraw the plea and heard counsel on the question of the sentence to be imposed. The State's attorney, despite the collapse of the plea bargain, recommended, and the court imposed, a first offender's sentence of five to 10 years on the narcotics count and two years on the larceny count; that is the precise sentence the State's Attorney had agreed to recommend as part of the plea bargain. Mr. Zaccagnino, however, was concerned that petitioner's unwillingness to go through with the plea bargain left petitioner vulnerable to the prosecution on the outstanding charges in the various counties: '(I)t was a matter that Your Honor would normally . . ., in a situation like this, enter concurrent sentences, if, in fact, it was so recommended by the State's Attorney; but since (petitioner) doesn't want to plea to these other matters, I would like to make that note for the record, because I feel at some later date he may have to come back to this court and see Your Honor or see another judge on these other matters now pending before it.'3\n\n\n21\nOn this state of facts, the Connecticut Supreme Court concluded that petitioner had not sustained his claim that a conflict of interest on the part of Mr. Zaccagnino rendered his plea involuntary and unintelligent. The Court said, 161 Conn., at 344\u2014345, 288 A.2d, at 62:\n\n\n22\n'There is nothing in the record before us which would      indicate that the alleged conflict resulted in ineffective      assistance of counsel and did in fact render the plea in      question involuntary and unintelligent. (Petitioner) does not      claim, and it is nowhere indicated in the finding, nor could      it be inferred from the finding, that either Attorney      Zaccagnino or Attorney Delaney induced (petitioner) to plead      guilty in furtherance of a plan to obtain more favorable      consideration from the court for other clients. . . . Neither      does the finding in any way disclose, nor is it claimed, that      (petitioner) received misleading advice from Attorney      Zaccagnino or Attorney Delaney which led him to plead guilty.      . . . Moreover, the trial court specifically found that when      (petitioner) engaged Zaccagnino as his counsel, he knew that Zaccagnino was representing two      defendants in the unrelated case in which he was a      codefendant, that he never complained to the court that he      was not satisfied with Attorney Zaccagnino because of this      dual representation, that he was not represented at the entry      of his plea by Attorney Zaccagnino, that he was represented      by Attorney Delaney at the entry of his plea, that he had a      lengthy conversation with Attorney Delaney prior to entering      his plea which he recalled completely, and that on specific      inquiry by the court before he pleaded guilty, he told the      court that he was satisfied with the representation by      Attorney Delaney. The court did not err in concluding that      (petitioner's) plea was not rendered involuntary and      unintelligent by the alleged conflict of interest.'\n\n\n23\nWe fully agree with this reasoning and conclusion of the Connecticut Supreme Court. Since there is thus no merit in petitioner's sole contention in this proceeding\u2014that Mr. Zaccagnino's alleged conflict of interest affected his plea\u2014that conflict of interest is not 'a reason for vacating his plea.' Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 267, 92 S.Ct. 495, 501, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971) (Marshall, J., concurring and dissenting).\n\n\n24\nAffirmed.\n\n\n25\nMr. Justice STEWART, concurring.\n\n\n26\nIn Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 267, 92 S.Ct. 495, 501, 30 L.Ed.2d 427, I joined Mr. Justice Marshall's separate opinion because I agree that 'where the defendant presents a reason for vacating his plea and the government has not relied on the plea to its disadvantage, the plea may be vacated and the right to trial regained at least where the motion to vacate is made prior to sentence and judgment.' Id., at 267\u2014268, 92 S.Ct., at 501\u2014502.\n\n\n27\nIf a defendant moves to withdraw a guilty plea before judgment and if he states a reason for doing so, I think that he need not shoulder a further burden of proving the 'merit' of his reason at that time. Before judgment, the courts should show solicitude for a defendant who wishes to undo a waiver of all the constitutional rights that surround the right to trial\u2014perhaps the most devastating waiver possible under our Constitution. Any requirement that a defendant prove the 'merit' of his reason for undoing this waiver would confuse the obvious difference between the withdrawal of a guilty plea before the government has relied on the plea to its disadvantage, and a later challenge to such a plea, on appeal or collaterally, when the judgment is final and the government clearly has relied on the plea.\n\n\n28\nBut I do not believe that these problems are presented in this case. Certiorari was granted to consider the petitioner's contention that his plea was made involuntarily and unintelligently because of his lawyer's alleged conflict of interest. This conflict-of-interest claim was not raised until a habeas corpus proceeding, years after judgment had been pronounced. The petitioner does not now challenge the refusal of the trial court to permit him to withdraw his guilty plea before judgment. Rather, he challenges a later refusal by the trial court to vacate his plea on a motion made well after judgment and sentence, presenting a claim not previously raised.\n\n\n29\nThus, I agree with the Court that the petitioner's claim should be evaluated under the standards governing an attack on a guilty plea made after judgment, not under the far different standards governing a motion to withdraw a plea made before judgment has been pronounced. I also agree with the Court that, evaluated under the former standards, the petitioner's claim of involuntariness attributable to his counsel's conflict of interest lacks merit.\n\n\n30\nIt is on this understanding that I join the opinion and judgment of the Court.\n\n\n31\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS joins, dissenting.\n\n\n32\nI dissent. Before sentencing, petitioner stated that he was innocent, and sought to vacate his guilty plea so that he could proceed to trial with new counsel in whom he had confidence. He claims, with ample support in the record, that he was advised to plead guilty\u2014and indeed pressured to do so\u2014by lawyers who did not devotedly represent his interests. I agree with petitioner that he shold have been permitted to withdraw his guilty plea.\n\n\n33\n* Petitioner, Charles Dukes, was arrested on March 14, 1967, and charged by Hartford, Connecticut, authorities with a violation of the Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act and with receiving stolen goods. From the beginning, there was a sharp conflict between petitioner and his lawyers over whether he should plead guilty. Two partners from the law firm that petitioner retained, each of whom handled the case on different occasions, tried to convince petitioner to plead guilty to both charges. They argued that because there were several other outstanding charges against him, petitioner's best hope was to secure an agreement to consolidate all the charges for disposition together, so that he could receive reasonable concurrent sentences. But petitioner maintained that he was innocent and would not agree to plead guilty. App. 39, 112, 119\u2014120.\n\n\n34\nAlthough petitioner had not yet pleaded to either of the charges, the narcotics case was called for trial on May 9, 1967. The conflict between lawyer and client surfaced dramatically when petitioner's attorney immediately sought to withdraw from the case 'because there happens to be a slight conflict between my client and myself, and it's not financial, Your Honor, it is one basically that goes to the heart of my representing him . ...' Noting his view that an advocate 'must believe in the cause' of his client, the lawyer went on to reiterate that the disagreement might 'prejudice the defendant.' He reported that petitioner 'either wants to represent himself or get counsel outside of the county that he can have more confidence in for some reason or other.' App. 9, 10, 17. The majority concedes that this announced 'conflict' was over the lawyer's insistence on pleading the client guilty. Then petitioner himself addressed the court to explain that 'with local counsel I am afraid, well, I know there is going to be resentment. I have reasons to believe that through conversations, and I'd like the opportunity to hire an attorney from another state that don't (sic) have no knowledge of the case . . . Otherwise . .. I intend to try my own case.' App. 18. Petitioner's lawyer spoke again, concluding with the judgment that he, for one, could not 'do this man justice in this particular issue.' App. 19\u201420. But the court denied counsel's motion to withdraw 'at this time.' Petitioner then pleaded not guilty, and trial was scheduled for the following morning.\n\n\n35\nProceedings did not actually resume until a week later, on May 16.1 After conversations in the courthouse that morning, App. 131\u2014132, Dukes agreed to follow the advice of his lawyers, who admittedly had been applying 'pressure' on him, App. 112, 140: he pled guilty to both the narcotics charge and the larceny-receiving charge. Prior to entry of the pleas, the judge asked petitioner whether he was 'fully satisfied with the services (your lawyer) is rendering you . . ..' App. 24, 41. Petitioner said that he was. But this satisfaction, such as it was, was short lived.\n\n\n36\nOn June 16, 1967, petitioner appeared for sentencing. His lawyer immediately informed the court that petitioner wished to withdraw his plea and had secured other counsel, from New Haven. Noting the lateness of these developments, petitioner's lawyer conceded that 'I had a suspicion . . . that this (might) take place because of the problem when he entered the plea. I was maybe a little forceful.' And although he disputed petitioner's claim that his present lawyers did not 'properly represent him,' counsel once again informed the court that petitioner 'doesn't have any confidence in me.' App. 28, 31. Petitioner himself told the court about his difficulty in getting a lawyer who would, he thought, do him justice. He also explained that when he pleaded guilty he was still recuperating from his recent suicide attempt, see n. 1, supra, and 'didn't realize at the time actually what I was pleading to.' App. 32. See n. 8, infra. Thus, contrary to the majority's description, petitioner, through his lawyer and in his own voice, gave several specific reasons for wanting to withdraw his plea.\n\n\n37\nFollowing the prosecutor's statement opposing petitioner's request, and without any further inquiry, the judge refused to let petitioner withdraw the guilty plea. When the judge asked Dukes what he wished to say before being sentenced, Dukes replied: 'I am rather flabbergasted really, because I didn't expect this this morning. It just puzzles me. I am not guilty of the charges. I am not guilty.' App. 33.2 Petitioner was sentenced to five to 10 years on the narcotics count and two years on the receiving-stolen-property count, as the prosecutor had recommended. The alleged reason for the plea\u2014to gain consolidation of all outstanding charges against petitioner, and thereby secure concurrent sentences on the pending charges\u2014was never fulfilled. On the day of sentencing, petitioner refused to plead guilty to any charges, and consolidation was impossible. App. 30\u201433, 157.\n\n\n38\nAs just noted, the sentencing judge did not inquire into the facts surrounding either petitioner's legal representation or his plea. But these facts were developed at a state habeas corpus hearing,3 and petitioner's lack of confidence in his lawyer finds striking support in the hearing record.\n\n\n39\nThat record details the sharp conflict between lawyer and client over the decision to plead guilty. But, more significantly, it reveals that the lawyer who advised petitioner to plead guilty had a gross conflict of interest. Ancillary to the instant proceedings, petitioner's lawyer was representing two young women charged with conspiracy to obtain money by false pretenses. Petitioner was a codefendant in this second case, and was represented by another attorney. This second prosecution was unrelated to the matter now before our Court. The two young women pleaded guilty to the false pretenses charges on April 18, 1967, and on June 2, 1967, appeared for sentencing. The sentencing judge was the same judge who was to sentence petitioner two weeks later.\n\n\n40\nIn his remarks to the judge on behalf of the two women, the lawyer told the court that these women had come 'under the influence of Charles Dukes,' who had led them astray. He pointed out that their cooperation with the state police had 'led to the downfall of Dukes' and 'capitulated (Dukes) into taking a plea (of guilty) on which he will shortly be removed from society.'4 He placed on Dukes the blame for the offenses committed by the women, saying that he was 'the most culpable since he had all the instruments with which to dupe the girls.' App. 43\u201444, 68\u201471.5 The two women were then sentenced to short prison terms.\n\n\n41\nIn short, to secure lighter sentences for one set of clients, the lawyer denigrated another of his clients who was to appear before the same judge for sentencing in two weeks. Even absent any showing that the lawyer's 'pressure' on petitioner to plead guilty was improperly motivated, the gross conflict of interest obvious from counsel's remarks lends strong support to petitioner's presentence claim that he was not receiving devoted representation from his attorney.\n\nII\n\n42\nI would permit petitioner to withdraw his guilty plea. As Justice Douglas has recently reminded us,\n\n\n43\n'However important plea bargaining may be in the      administration of criminal justice, our opinions have      established that a guilty plea is a serious and sobering      occasion inasmuch as it constitutes a waiver of the      fundamental rights to a jury trial, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391      U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491, to confront one's      accusers, Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13      L.Ed.2d 923, to present witnesses in one's defense,      Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 18 L.Ed.2d      1019, to remain silent, Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct.      1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653, and to be convicted of proof beyond all      reasonable doubt, In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068,      25 L.Ed.2d 368.' Santobello v. New York, 404 .u.S. 257, 264, 92 S.Ct. 495, 500, 30      L.Ed.2d 427 (1971) (concurring opinion).\n\n\n44\nSee Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 243, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1712, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969). The precondition for all these rights is the constitutional 'right not to plead guilty.' United States v. Jackson, 390 U.S. 570, 581, 88 S.Ct. 1209, 1216, 20 L.Ed.2d 138 (1968). A defendant may waive his constitutional rights through a guilty plea, but such waivers are not quickly presumed, and, in fact, are viewed with the 'utmost solicitude.' Boykin v. Alabama, supra, 395 U.S., at 243, 89 S.Ct., at 1712. Our decisions, constitutional and statutory, have all recognized that, consistent with the requirements of law enforcement, adequate safeguards can and should exist to give meaning to the right not to plead guilty. E.g., Santobello v. New York, supra; Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 1468, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970); Boykin v. Alabama, supra; McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969); White v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed.2d 193 (1963); Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962); Walker v. Johnston, 312 U.S. 275, 61 S.Ct. 574, 85 L.Ed. 830 (1941); Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220, 47 S.Ct. 582, 71 L.Ed. 1009 (1927).\n\n\n45\nI would not view a guilty plea as an irrevocable waiver of a defendant's federal constitutional right to a full trial, even where the plea is, strictly speaking, 'voluntarily' entered. I adhere to the view that 'where the defendant presents a reason for vacating his plea and the government has not relied on the plea to its disadvantage, the plea may be vacated and the right to trial regained at least where the motion to vacate is made prior to sentence and judgment.' Santobello v. New York, supra, 404 U.S., at 267\u2014268, 92 S.Ct., at 501 (opinion of Marshall, J., concurring and dissenting, with whom Brennan, J., and Stewart, J., joined).\n\n\n46\nSuch a rule is a sensible part of the constitutional law of waiver. We view guilty pleas with the 'utmost solicitude' because they involve the simultaneous waiver of so many constitutional rights; our system of law favors the assertion of constitutional rights, not their waiver. It is inconsistent with that basic viewpoint for guilty pleas to be irrevocable even before sentencing. Usually because of new information or new insights, defendants may have 'sober second thoughts' about their pleas. Where the sentencing itself is postponed beyond the day of pleading, the door should not be slammed shut to formal reconsideration of the decision to plead guilty. A guilty plea is not a trap. Ordinarily, a defendant who changes his mind for sufficient reason and in timely fashion should not be deemed to have waived his right to a full trial. In short, absent the government's showing specific and substantial harm, I would generally permit withdrawal of the plea before sentencing.\n\n\n47\nSuch a rule would not compromise the government's interests. '(I)n the ordinary case where a motion to vacate is made prior to sentencing, the government has taken no action in reliance on the previously entered guilty plea and would suffer no harm from the plea's withdrawal.' Santobello v. New York, supra, at 268, 92 S.Ct., at 502 (opinion of Marshall, J., concurring and dissenting). The defendant seeks only the basic opportunity to contest the original charges against him. A full trial could be promptly held, and, since the period between plea and sentencing is usually short, there will have been no substantial delay. Where the government can show specific and substantial harm, the defendant may be held to his plea. But, ordinarily, the government can claim only disappointed expectations. In such a case, the balance of interests must favor vindication of the individual's most basic constitutional rights.\n\n\n48\nIn the instant case, petitioner tendered a specific reason for vacating his guilty plea. Protesting his innocence, he claimed that he was not getting satisfactory legal representation and had retained new counsel. The record as already made by June 16, 1967, showed an admitted and longstanding conflict between lawyer and client over the course of the litigation. Properly advised by loyal counsel, the defendant himself, of course, must have the ultimate decision about pleading guilty. The lawyer admitted that he had been 'a little forceful' in urging petitioner to plead guilty. Given all these things, petitioner, in my view, had ample justification for rescinding the plea before sentencing.\n\n\n49\nBut we need not be limited to the bare record already made by June 16, 1967. The trial judge then did not even minimally inquire into the facts behind petitioner's rather inarticulate claims. He should have done so, rather than quickly and simply denying the motion to vacate the plea. It was not until the state habeas action that the facts surrounding petitioner's representation were developed. As this subsequent record shows, petitioner's fears that he was not getting devoted representation had strong objective basis. (It is of course irrelevant that the evidence of a clear conflict of interest may have exceeded even petitioner's earlier fears of inadequate representation.6) As the court below concluded,\n\n\n50\n'Obviously, the derogatory remarks by (the attorney) on      behalf of his clients in one case about a client whom he is representing in another case were highly      improper. 'When a client engages the services of a lawyer in      a given piece of business he is entitled to feel that, until      that business is finally disposed of in some manner, he has      the undivided loyalty of the one upon whom he looks as his      advocate and his champion.\" 161 Conn. 337, 345\u2014346, 288 A.2d      58, 62\u201463 (1971).\n\n\n51\nThis finding of 'improper' conduct gives graphic support to petitioner's presentence claim that his lawyers were not properly representing his interests, the main reason petitioner gave for wanting to withdraw his plea.\n\n\n52\nThere is no need to decide whether this conflict of interest deprived petitioner of his Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel, or functioned to make his guilty plea 'involuntary.' It is sufficient to conclude here that, before sentencing, petitioner's plausible dissatisfaction with counsel constituted a sufficient reason for withdrawing his guilty plea.7 The majority appears to equate the questions, suggesting by its analysis that if the plea was neither involuntary nor secured and 'affected' by unconstitutionally ineffective counsel, it may not be vacated. But this is to equate the situations before and after sentencing. I think we are required to apply a much less rigorous standard before sentencing. The point in this case is that (1) petitioner sought to vacate his plea before sentencing because he questioned the representation he was receiving, and that (2) petitioner's conclusions, on this record, were plausible, to say the least. This, it seems to me, is enough to permit withdrawal of the plea before sentencing. The majority totally ignores the fact that the record demonstrates a long-standing conflict between lawyer and client, that the lawyer himself admitted being forceful in securing the plea, and that the lawyer engaged in what the court below found to be 'highly improper' conduct in conflict with the loyalty a client rightfully expects from his lawyer. As if he did not understand whose choice it is to go to trial, petitioner's own lawyer gave this extraordinary account of his relationship with petitioner, who throughout protested his innocence:\n\n\n53\n'(Dukes) claimed consistently to me that he didn't make any      sale of narcotics, and so I told him what I thought about the      case, after reviewing the evidence. So from the beginning,      Dukes wanted a trial, and I probably thought I might have      been too forceful, but it sometimes happens that your      judgment, you're trying to impose upon a client, knowing that      it's in his best interest, at least in your opinion it is,      and I told Charlie it would be winning the battle and      clearing the way, because there was no way, with these five      felony warrants pending against him, that I was able to win      them all, because I said no matter what you think about this      case, it's my opinion that it's your best interest to plead      guilty, and at no time did I have a conversation whether he      was guilty or not. Mr. Delaney handled that at the time of      the change of plea, but I know when I talked to him, he      maintained he was innocent. At some later date he changed his      plea, so I assume there was some conversation about that, and      I don't know what took place in the meantime, but basically,      there was the reason that I made that statement to the Court,      because he was insistent that he wanted to try the case, and      I kept trying to get the matter put down, because I didn't      think it was in his best interest to try it.' App. 120.\n\n\n54\nOf course, on my view, it is of no real significance that on the day of the guilty plea petitioner expressed satisfaction with counsel. Where the loyalties of counsel are questioned even after the plea is entered, a defendant undercuts the premise of his prior guilty plea and the waiver of rights that plea entailed. Surely the same is true where, as here, the defendant specifically asserts his innocence after pleading.8\n\n\n55\nWhen a defendant gives a reason for withdrawing his plea before sentencing, and the reason is a good one, he should be allowed to withdraw the plea and regain his right to a trial. Here, petitioner's reason was conflict of interest of his lawyer. A part of this conflict was his lawyer's insistence that he plead guilty and petitioner's insistence that he was innocent. This is certainly a conflict. No wonder the last words of petitioner before sentencing were:\n\n\n56\n'I am rather flabbergasted really, because I didn't expect      this this morning. It just puzzles me. I am not guilty of the      charges. I am not guilty.' The State in our case has never claimed that it would suffer any harm beyond disappointed expectations about the plea itself.9 Where the defendant has presented a plausible reason for withdrawing his plea, this mere disappointment cannot bar him from regaining his constitutional rights before sentencing.\n\n\n57\nI would remand the case with instructions that the plea be vacated and petitioner given an opportunity to replead to the charges in the information.\n\n\n\n1\n 'Q. . . . On June 2nd, weren't you in Court with Mr. Zaccagnino when your case had to be postponed . . .?\n'A. I'm trying to think of the day that the girls got sentenced, because I was not in Court the day they got sentenced, because I know that I wasn't in Court that specific day, because that's when I was told what was said about me, and so forth and so on, in Court, so I'm quite sure I wasn't in Court that day.' App. to Petitioner's Brief, 162\u2014163 (emphasis supplied).\n\n\n2\n The state habeas court took evidence on the question whether his plea was involuntary as the product of the after-effects of his suicide attempt and found against petitioner. Petitioner has not sought review on this question. The only issue before us is his claim that the alleged conflict of interest rendered the plea involuntary and unintelligent.\n\n\n3\n As events proved, all other charges pending in the various counties were dismissed, although after the decision of the Connecticut Supreme Court affirming petitioner's conviction on direct appeal. Petitioner thus received the benefits of the plea bargain without paying the cost of pleading guilty to the other offenses.\n\n\n1\n The record discloses that on May 10 the case was continued until May 16 for trial. On May 9, as petitioner left the courtroom, he was arrested by Hartford police on other charges. Petitioner attempted suicide while in police custody, and was hospitalized for several days.\n\n\n2\n The New Haven attorney was not in the courtroom, although he had telephoned the prosecutor that morning from out of town. Petitioner apparently expected his new lawyer to be present in the courtroom and to 'take over' after the guilty plea was withdrawn. App. 150\u2014151. That lawyer did represent petitioner on his direct appeal to the Supreme Court of Connecticut. 157 Conn. 498, 255 A.2d 614 (1969).\n\n\n3\n I express no view on the subject of whether further evidentiary development might be appropriate were petitioner to pursue this case on federal habeas corpus. See nn. 4 and 7, infra. Given the way I view this case, enough is present in the record to vindicate petitioner's position.\n\n\n4\n It is not clear from the lawyer's words whether he meant that Dukes had been 'capitulated' into pleading guilty to the offense allegedly committed with the two women. At the habeas hearing, the lawyer testified that he did not remember Dukes' ever taking a plea in that case. App. 122. There is a strong basis for thinking that the lawyer was in fact referring to the guilty plea entered in our case. At the women's sentencing, he specifically stated that 'since I was on both sides of the case, having been on the other side on the other case I can tell Your Honor that it was these girls that .. . capitulated (Dukes) into taking a plea . . ..' App. 68 (emphasis added). However, the court below found that all the 'remarks by (the attorney) concerning the plaintiff had only to do with the relationship of the plaintiff and the two girls in that particular case where all three of them were codefendants, and in no way referred to the present case for which he was later to be sentenced.' 161 Conn. 337, 341, 288 A.2d 58, 60. Nevertheless, certified court records sent to our Court make clear that Dukes never pleaded guilty to the offenses involving the women, and those charges were nolled in February 1970. A direct connection between the false pretenses case and our case is apparently conceded by today's majority when it notes that the plea bargain in our case included a deal in which petitioner would plead guilty to the false pretenses charge. See ante, at 253\u2014254. Obviously, if counsel was in fact reporting the women's role in 'capitulating' Dukes to plead guilty in our case, his own conflict of interest would be even more pernicious than that now clear from the record.\n\n\n5\n the court below observed that these 'improper remarks made by counsel on June 2, 1967, were a repetition of what had already been told to the court in substance by the State's attorney.' 161 Conn., at 347, 288 A.2d, at 63. (The court made a similar observation about the presentence report, which is not in our record.) This, of course, is irrelevant to the question of whether petitioner was represented by an attorney loyal to his interests. But, in any event, it is incorrect to say that counsel's remarks merely repeated the statements of the prosecutor. The prosecutor simply reported that the two women 'became associated with one Charles Dukes . . . Charles Dukes had paraphernalia with respect to checks and money orders and they agreed to cash these checks with false credentials furnished by him.' App. 65. This is a far cry from the vivid and pointedly argumentative remarks of the women's (and petitioner's) lawyer.\n\n\n6\n The majority suggests that on June 16 petitioner knew about his lawyer's remarks at the women's sentencing, but didn't tell the court. Ante, at 254\u2014455. The majority gives us no clue why petitioner would possibly want to withhold this information, if he had it. Rather, its factual conclusion rests on a single phrase in petitioner's habeas corpus testimony, and burdens this rather inarticulate petitioner with the linguistic precision of Justices of this Court. Read in context and with what I think is more common sense, petitioner's awkward phrasing clearly refers to the day 'when' the lawyer's remarks were made, not when petitioner was subsequently 'told' about them. I think it apparent that when petitioner sought to vacate his plea on June 16, he did not know about his lawyer's particular act of betrayal on June 2. What is clear, however, is that the judge who sentenced Dukes was fully aware of the lawyer's remarks, having heard them two weeks earlier before sentencing the women.\n\n\n7\n The majority intimates that we are restricted to deciding this case on a 'voluntariness' theory. It is true that, since precedent suggested that petitioner's only possible line of constitutional attack was to challenge the 'voluntariness' of his plea, his papers have focused on this approach, although not exclusively. See Brief for Petitioner 16, 19, 22. But we are not restricted to the precise formulation petitioner has favored. At all relevant times in this action, petitioner claimed that he should have been permitted to withdraw his guilty plea before sentencing because his lawyer was not rendering satisfactory representation. Ibid. This is the claim, raised here and below, which I would reach and decide.\n\n\n8\n Petitioner also claimed that on the day of the plea he was in a weakened physical state because of his recent hospitalization and in a confused state of mind. This claim was explored at the state habeas hearing, where petitioner also testified that when he pleaded guilty he thought that the plea was merely 'temporary.' App. 149\u2014150, 154. Although the habeas court found that petitioner's plea was 'voluntarily and intelligently made,' App. 46, petitioner had clearly gone through a trying week before the plea. See, n. 1, supra. In my view, the uncontradicted facts about his recent hospitalization, App. 40, would themselves entitle petitioner to a 'sober second thought,' and to withdraw his plea before sentencing.\n\n\n9\n Ours is not a case in which, prior to the defendant's motion to vacate his plea, the government had performed its part of a plea bargain and could not be restored to the status quo ante. Since petitioner had pleaded guilty to the original charges filed against him, no counts had been irrevocably dismissed prior to petitioner's motion to vacate. When, on the day of sentencing, petitioner refused to plead guilty to pending charges in other cases, be could not receive the benefits of an agreement concerning those pending charges; but the government was not thereby hurt. See supra, at 262. Obviously, where the government has simply agreed to recommend a specific sentence, withdrawal of the plea before sentencing would not compromise the government's position.\n\n\n","label":0}

{"text":"356 U.S. 363\n78 S.Ct. 766\n2 L.Ed.2d 837\nOleta O'Connor YATES, Petitioner,v.UNITED STATES of America.\nNo. 841.\nDecided May 5, 1958.\n\nMessrs.\nBen Margolis, and Leo Branton, Jr., Los Angeles, Cal., for petitioner.\nMr. J. Lee Rankin, Sol. Gen., Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nThis case has a long history, the course of which must be summarized for understanding of the Court's disposition. On July 26, 1951, petitioner was arrested for conspiracy to violate the Smith Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 2385, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 2385, and was released on furnishing $7,500 bail. On the following day bail was increased to $50,000 pending transfer of the proceedings to a different city and petitioner was recommitted. On August 2 petitioner was arraigned, and several days later bail was set at $25,000. Petitioner's writ of habeas corpus seeking a reduction of bail was dismissed. The district judge who had fixed bail was disqualified, see Connelly v. United States District Court 9 Cir., 191 F.2d 692, and the district judge whose sentence is now under review was assigned to the case. On motion of the Government, the court increased bail to $50,000 on August 30; petitioner's motion to reduce bail and her petition for a writ of habeas corpus were denied; on review of the denial of habeas corpus, the Court of Appeals affirmed, Stack v. Boyle 9 Cir., 192 F.2d 56. This Court, however, found that bail had 'not been fixed by proper methods' and remitted the case for the proper remedy of a motion to reduce bail, Stack v. Boyle 342 U.S. 1, 7, 72 S.Ct. 1, 4, 96 L.Ed. 3. The District Court denied such motion by petitioner, United States v. Schneiderman, 102 F.Supp. 52; on appeal, the Court of Appeals ordered bail set at $10,000. Stack v. United States, 9 Cir., 193 F.2d 875. Shortly thereafter, on December 10, 1951, petitioner, having been found to have been imporperly confined since August 30 of that year, was released on bail.\n\n\n2\nThe trial under the conspiracy indictment began on February 5, 1952. Testifying in her own defense, petitioner on cross-examination on June 26 refused to answer four questions about Communist membership of other persons; she was adjudged guilty of civil contempt and committed to jail until the contempt had been purged. On June 30 she refused to answer eleven questions about Communist membership of other persons; the court announced its intention to treat these refusals as criminal contempt. At the conclusion of the trial petitioner was found guilty of conspiracy to violate the Smith Act and was sentenced to serve five years' imprisonment and to pay a $10,000 fine. The District Court denied bail pending appeal of the conspiracy conviction; on application to the Court of Appeals to fix bail, the case was remanded to the District Court, which again denied bail. United States v. Schneiderman, 106 F.Supp. 941. The Court of Appeals then fixed bail at $20,000, and on August 30 petitioner, upon furnishing that amount, was released from custody, having been in jail since June 26. The conspiracy conviction was later affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 9 Cir., 225 F.2d 146, but reversed by this Court, 354 U.S. 298, 77 S.Ct. 1064, 1 L.Ed.2d 1356. The indictment was eventually dismissed on motion of the Government.\n\n\n3\nPetitioner had in the meantime, on August 8, 1952, been adjudged guilty of eleven criminal contempts for her eleven refusals to answer on June 30, and she was sentenced by the District Court to eleven one-year terms of imprisonment, to run concurrently and to commence upon the completion of petitioner's imprisonment for the conspiracy. It is as to this sentence that review is sought here today.\n\n\n4\nOn September 3, 1952, four days after petitioner's release from custody, the District Court ordered her recommitted on the civil contempt arising out of the four refusals to answer on June 26. 107 F.Supp. 408. The District Court denied her application for bail pending appeal, but the Court of Appeals granted it, and she was released two days after her commitment; the Court of Appeals subsequently reversed the recommitment order of the District Court on the ground that petitioner should not have been reconfined for civil contempt after the close of the main trial. ,9 Cir., 227 F.2d 844. Two days after her release on bail, on September 8, petitioner was adjudged guilty of criminal contempt for the four June 26 refusals and sentenced to four three-year terms of imprisonment, to run concurrently. 107 F.Supp. 412. Petitioner was then reconfined; the District Court denied her bail pending appeal, but the Court of Appeals granted it, and she was released on bail three days after her recommitment. The Court of Appeals subsequently reversed this contempt judgment because of the District Court's failure to give any notice that it intended to regard the June 26 refusals as criminal contempts, 9 Cir., 227 F.2d 848.\n\n\n5\nPetitioner appealed her conviction of criminal contempt for the eleven refusals to answer on June 30; the Court of Appeals affirmed. 9 Cir., 227 F.2d 851. This Court held that there was but one contempt, not eleven, and that a sentence for only one offense could be imposed. Accordingly, we vacated the one-year sentence for that one conviction and remanded the case to the District Court for determination of a new sentence appropriate in view of our setting aside of the punishment for eleven offenses when in fact only one was legally established. 355 U.S. 66, 78 S.Ct. 128, 2 L.Ed.2d 95. On remand, the District Court, after hearing, resentenced petitioner to one year's imprisonment. The court denied petitioner bail pending appeal; the Court of Appeals ordered her admitted to bail in the amount of $5,000, 9 Cir., 252 F.2d 568, and she was released after fifteen days' confinement. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court, noting that the sentence was 'severe.' Ibid.\n\n\n6\nReversing a judgment for contempt because of errors of substantive law may naturally call for a reduction of the sentence based on an extent of wrongdoing found unsustainable in law. Such reduction of the sentence, however, normally ought not be made by this Court. It should be left, on remand, to the sentencing court. And so, when this Court found that only a single offense was committed by petitioner, and not eleven offenses, it chose not to reduce the sentence but to leave this task, with gentle intimations of the necessity for such action, to the District Court. However, when in a situation like this the District Court appears not to have exercised its discretion in the light of the reversal of the judgment but, in effect, to have sought merely to justify the original sentence, this Court has no alternative except to exercise its supervisory power over the administration of justice in the lower federal courts by setting aside the sentence of the District Court.\n\n\n7\nAlthough petitioner's conviction under the Smith Act, the substantive offense out of which this subsidiary matter arose, was reversed on appeal and the indictment itself dismissed on motion of the Government, she has in fact spent seven months in jail in the course of these proceedings. Not unmindful of petitioner's offense, this Court is of the view, exercising the judgment that we are now called upon to exercise, that the time that petitioner has already served in jail is an adequate punishment for her offense in refusing to answer questions and is to be deemed in satisfaction of the new sentence herein ordered formally to be imposed. Accordingly, the writ of certiorari is granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the cause remanded to the District Court with directions to reduce the sentence to the time petitioner has already been confined in the course of these proceedings.\n\n\n8\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n9\nCause remanded with directions.\n\n\n10\nThe CHIEFT JUSTICE, Mr. Justice BLACK, and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS concur in the result for reasons set out in their dissents in Yates v. United States, 355 U.S. 66, 76, 78 S.Ct. 128, 134, 2 L.Ed.2d 95, and Green v. United States, 356 U.S. 165, 193, 78 S.Ct. 632, 648, but under constraint of the Court's holdings in those cases they acquiesce in the opinion here.\n\n\n11\nMr. Justice CLARK, with whom Mr. Justice BURTON and Mr. Justice WHITTAKER concur, dissenting.\n\n\n12\nIt is for us to say whether the one-year sentence was improper rather than to pass on the adequacy of time already served on other judgments. Petitioner has served but 15 days on this sentence, and I therefore dissent from the judgment releasing her.\n\n","label":0}

{"text":"417 U.S. 333\n94 S.Ct. 2298\n41 L.Ed.2d 109\nJoseph Anthony DAVIS, Petitioner,v.UNITED STATES.\nNo. 72\u20141454.\nArgued Feb. 26, 1974.\nDecided June 10, 1974.\n\nSyllabus\nAfter being declared a delinquent, petitioner was ordered to report for induction pursuant to Selective Service regulations, which permitted the ordering of a declared delinquent to report for induction even though he had not been found acceptable for military service. When petitioner did not report as ordered, he was prosecuted and convicted for failure to report for induction. Following a remand by the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in the light of the intervening decision of this Court in Gutknecht v. United States, 396 U.S. 295, 90 S.Ct. 506, 24 L.Ed.2d 532, the District Court concluded that Gutknecht did not affect the conviction, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. While petitioner's petition for certiorari was pending in this Court, the Court of Appeals decided United States v. Fox, 454 F.2d 593, wherein, on the authority of Gutknecht, that court reversed a conviction based on facts virtually identical to those on which petitioner's conviction was based. This Court subsequently denied certiorari in the petitioner's case. After beginning his sentence, petitioner brought this collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, asserting that the Court of Appeals in the Fox case had effected a change in the law of the Ninth Circuit after affirmance of his conviction and that the holding in Fox required that his conviction be set aside. The District Court summarily denied relief. The Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that because petitioner had unsuccessfully litigated the Gutknecht issue on direct review, the court's earlier affirmance was 'the law of the case' and precluded petitioner from securing relief under \u00a7 2255 on the basis of an intervening change in law. Held:\n1. Even though the legal issue raised in a prior direct appeal from petitioner's conviction was determined against petitioner, he is not precluded from raising the issue in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding 'if new law has been made . . . since the trial and appeal.' Kaufman v. United States, 394 U.S. 217, 230, 89 S.Ct. 1068, 1076, 22 L.Ed.2d 227. Pp. 341\u2014342.\n2. The fact that petitioner's claim is grounded 'in the laws of the United States' rather than in the Constitution does not preclude its assertion in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, particularly since \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to assert a claim that his confinement is 'in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States.' Sunal v. Large, 332 U.S. 174, 67 S.Ct. 1588, 91 L.Ed. 1982, distinguished. Pp. 346\u2014347.\n3. The issue that petitioner raises is cognizable in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. Pp. 346\u2014347.\n472 F.2d 596, reversed and remanded.\nMarvin M. Karpatkin, New York City, for petitioner.\nEdmund W. Kitch, Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\nMr. Justice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis case involves the availability of collateral relief from a federal criminal conviction based upon an intervening change in substantive law. While the question presented is a relatively narrow one, it arises as the result of a rather complicated chain of events.\n\n\n2\n* In February 1965, the petitioner, Joseph Anthony Davis, was classified I\u2014A by his draft board and ordered to report for a pre-induction physical examination. Davis failed to appear on the appointed date. He later informed his local board that his failure to report was due to illness. Although the board attempted to arrange a second date for the pre-induction physical, its attempts to communicate with the petitioner were frustrated by his failure to keep the board apprised of his correct mailing addresses. As a result, the local board's communications to the petitioner were returned to the board stamped 'addressee unknown,' and Davis again failed to report for the physical. In December 1965, the board sent the petitioner a warning that it was considering declaring him a delinquent because of his failure to report for the second pre-induction physical.1 This communication was also returned to the board stamped 'addressee unknown.'\n\n\n3\nAfter another unsuccessful attempt to communicate with the petitioner, the local board declared him a delinquent, pursuant to 32 CFR \u00a7 1642.4(a) (1967),2 both because of his failure to report for the second pre-induction physical and because of his failure to keep the local board informed of his current address.3 At the same time the board mailed the petitioner a delinquency notice. Shortly after the delinquency declaration, the board sent the petitioner an order directing him to report for induction into the Armed Forces. Once again, the order was returned to the board stamped 'addressee unknown.' Several months later, the board sent the petitioner a second order to report for induction. This time the order was mailed to a St. Paul, Minnesota, address that Davis had used when requesting a duplicate draft card. Although there was no indication that Davis did not receive the induction order, he once again failed to report as ordered. This second failure to report for induction resulted in the petitioner's prosecution and conviction under 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 462(a).4\n\n\n4\nAt the time that the local board issued the second induction order, 32 CFR \u00a7 1631.7(a) (1967) provided that registrants could be ordered to report for induction only after they '(had) been found acceptable for service in the Armed Forces and . . . the local board (had) mailed (them) a Statement of Acceptability . . . at least 21 days before the date fixed for induction.' Since, at the time of his induction order, Davis had not yet appeared for a physical examination to determine his acceptability, quite obviously neither one of these requirements was satisfied. The regulation, however, went on to provide that 'a registrant classified in Class I\u2014A or Class I\u2014A\u2014O who is a delinquent may be selected and ordered to report for induction to fill an induction call notwithstanding the fact that he has not been found acceptable for service in the Armed Forces and has not been mailed a Statement of Acceptability . . ..' The only other registrants similarly excepted from these prerequisites were those who had volunteered for induction. In light of this proviso, the local board evidently concluded that the preconditions to induction stated in \u00a7 1631.7(a) were inapplicable to the petitioner, whom it had earlier declared to be a delinquent, and that it was thus free to issue an induction order to the petitioner.5\n\n\n5\nDavis appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. While that appeal was pending, this Court announced its decision in Gutknecht v. United States, 396 U.S. 295, 90 S.Ct. 506, 24 L.Ed.2d 532 (1970). In Gutknecht a Selective Service registrant's induction had been accelerated because his local board had declared him a delinquent.6 When he failed to report for induction as ordered, he was prosecuted and convicted under 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 462. The delinquent registrant's accelerated induction was ordered in accordance with another portion of 32 CFR \u00a7 1631.7(a) that, like the provision applicable to Davis, called for exceptional treatment for registrants whom a local board had declared delinquent. Local boards were authorized by 32 CFR \u00a7 1642.4 to issue a declaration of delinquency '(w)henever a registrant . . . failed to perform any duty or duties required of him under the selective service law,' other than to report as ordered for induction or for civilian work. Both Davis and Gutknecht were declared delinquent on the authority of \u00a7 1642.4.7 In Gutknecht, the Court held that the Selective Service regulations that accelerated the induction of delinquent registrants by shifting them to the first priority in the order of call were punitive in nature and, as such, were without legislative sanction.8 Accordingly, the Court concluded that the registrant could not be prosecuted for failure to comply with an induction order issued pursuant to these regulations.\n\n\n6\nAfter Gutknecht, the Court of Appeals remanded the petitioner's case to the District Court 'without limitation of scope but especially for consideration . . . in the light of the intervening decision of Gutknecht v. United States.' 432 F.2d 1009, 1010 (1970). On remand, the District Court, after conducting a hearing, concluded that the petitioner's induction had not been accelerated because of his delinquency status and that Gutknecht therefore did not affect his conviction.9 On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed. 447 F.2d 1376.\n\n\n7\nWhile Davis' subsequent petition for certiorari was pending in this Court, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decided United States v. Fox, 454 F.2d 593. The circumstances leading to Fox's induction order were virtually identical to those in the petitioner's case. Like Davis, 'Fox was declared delinquent by his Selective Service Board . . . for his failure to appear for pre-induction physical examinations as ordered . . ..' Ibid. Prior to receiving his induction order, 'Fox . . . was never found to be 'acceptable for service' and he was (not) mailed a Statement of Acceptability . . . at least 21 days before his induction date . . ..' '(T)hus the only authority the Local Board had for its order to Fox to report for induction was the provision of \u00a7 1631.7(b)10 for delinquents to be called without a previous finding of acceptability or the mailing of a Statement of Acceptability 21 days before induction.' Id., at 595. This was the same regulation on which the board's induction order to Davis had been preducated.\n\n\n8\nAt Fox's post-Gutknecht trial for failure to report for induction, 'the government offered evidence . . . to show that Fox's induction order was not accelerated by the declaration of delinquency.' 'The trial judge found no acceleration and convicted.' Id., at 593\u2014594. The Court of Appeals reversed Fox's conviction on the authority of Gutknecht. The court held that Fox's induction was accelerated by the declaration of delinquency as a matter of law (because) (w)ithout the declaration, the Board could not have ordered him to report for induction.' Id., at 594. Thus, the court concluded 'that the (induction) order . . . was illegal and created no duty on Fox's part to report for induction.' Id., at 595.\n\n\n9\nIn opposing Davis' petition for certiorari, the Solicitor General Conceded that 'the holdings in Fox and in (Davis) are inconsistent,' but nevertheless urged the Court to deny certiorari in that 'the conflict is an intra-circuit one . . . (to) be resolved by the Ninth Circuit itself . . ..' Supplemental Memorandum for the United States in Opposition 2 (No. 71\u2014661, O.T.1971). We denied Davis' petition for certiorari. 405 U.S. 933, 92 S.Ct. 939, 30 L.Ed.2d 809.\n\n\n10\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt to secure a rehearing in the Court of Appeals, Davis was remitted to federal custody to commence serving his three-year sentence. He then instituted the present collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which permits '(a) prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States . . . (to) move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.' In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Davis asserted that the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had in the Fox case effected a change in the law of that Circuit after the affirmance of his conviction, and that its holding in Fox required his conviction to be set aside. The District Court summarily denied the petitioner's motion.11 On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed without considering the merits of the petitioner's claim on the ground that '(t)he decision on the direct appeal is the law of the case,' and that therefore any 'new law, or change in law' resulting from its decision in United States v. Fox would 'not (be) applied in this circuit under circumstances such as here presented.' 472 F.2d 596. Because the case presents a seemingly important question concerning the extent to which relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is available by reason of an intervening change in law, we granted certiorari. 414 U.S. 999, 94 S.Ct. 351, 38 L.Ed.2d 234.\n\nII\n\n11\nThe sole issue before the Court in the present posture of this case is the propriety of the Court of Appeals' judgment that a change in the law of that Circuit after the petitioner's conviction may not be successfully asserted by him in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding.12 Thus, our inquiry is confined to the availability of a \u00a7 2255 proceeding for the resolution of Davis' claim to relief from his conviction.\n\n\n12\nBecause the petitioner had unsuccessfully litigated the Gutknecht issue on direct review, the Court of Appeals held that its earlier affirmance was 'the law of the case' and precluded the petitioner from asserting on collateral attack his claim that its Fox decision had subsequently changed the law of the Ninth Circuit on that issue. In this Court, the Solicitor General's brief concedes that the opinion of the Court of Appeals in this regard 'is not consonant with this Court's holding in Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1 (83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148).13 In Sanders, the Court held inter alia, that even though the legal issue raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion 'was determined against (the applicant) on the merits on a prior application,' 'the applicant may (nevertheless) be entitled to a new hearing upon showing an intervening change in the law . . ..' Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 17, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 1078, 10 L.Ed.2d 148. The same rule applies when the prior determination was made on direct appeal from the applicant's conviction, instead of in an earlier \u00a7 2255 proceeding, 'if new law has been made . . . since the trial and appeal.' Kaufman v. United States, 394 U.S. 217, 230, 89 S.Ct. 1068, 1076, 22 L.Ed.2d 227 (1969). Thus, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that 'the law of the case,' as determined in the earlier appeal from the petitioner's conviction, precluded him from securing relief under \u00a7 2255 on the basis of an intervening change in law.\n\n\n13\nNevertheless, the Solicitor General contends that we should affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals because the petitioner's claim is not 'of constitutional dimension' (Brief for United States 34) and thus is not cognizable in a \u00a7 2255 collateral proceeding. At the outset, we note that the Government's position finds scant support in the text of \u00a7 2255, which permits a federal prisoner to assert a claim that his confinement is 'in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States.' (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n14\nIt is argued forcefully in a dissenting opinion today that this language, which appears in the first paragraph of \u00a7 2255, is somehow qualified by the third paragraph of the statute, which provides:\n\n\n15\n'If the court finds that the judgment was rendered without      jurisdiction, or that the sentence imposed was not authorized      by law or otherwise open to collateral attack, or that there      has been such a denial or infringement of the constitutional      rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment vulnerable      to collateral attack, the court shall vacate and set the      judgment aside and shall discharge the prisoner or resentence      him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may      appear appropriate.'\n\n\n16\nThe dissent of Mr. Justice REHNQUIST rejects any suggestion that the language concerning 'sentence(s) . . . otherwise open to collateral attack' can encompass a claim that a confinement under that sentence violates the 'laws of the United States,' contending that this would reduce the remaining language regarding 'a denial or infringement of constitutional rights' to surplusage. Indeed, the nub of the dissent is that \u00a7 2255 'does not speak of an illegal 'confinement' . . . or even of an illegal conviction, but rather of illegal sentences.' Post, at 2309. (Emphasis in original.) Although this microscopic analysis of \u00a7 2255 surely shows that the statutory language is somewhat lacking in precision, the resulting shadow that the dissenting opinion would cast over the statute totally disappears in the light of its legislative history.\n\n\n17\nThat history makes clear that \u00a7 2255 was intended to afford federal prisoners a remedy identical in scope to federal habeas corpus. As the Court pointed out in United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 219, 72 S.Ct. 263, 272, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952), the 'history of Section 2255 shows that it was passed at the instance of the Judicial Conference to meet practical difficulties that had arisen in administering the habeas corpus jurisdiction of the federal courts. Nowhere in the history of Section 2255 do we find any purpose to impinge upon prisoners' rights of collateral attack upon their convictions. On the contrary, the sole purpose was to minimize the difficulties encountered in habeas corpus hearings by affording the same rights in another and more convenient forum.' Thus, there can be no doubt that the grounds for relief under \u00a7 2255 are equivalent to those encompassed by \u00a7 2254, the general federal habeas corpus statute, under which relief is available on the ground that '(a person) is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.' (Emphasis added.) Furthermore, although the dissent of Mr. Justice REHNQUIST derides the view that the words 'otherwise open to collateral attack' are intended to be 'a catch-all phrase,' post, at 358, the legislative history fully supports that view. In recommending to Congress what eventually became \u00a7 2255, the Judicial Conference Committee on Habeas Corpus Procedure stated that '(t)he motion remedy broadly covers all situations where the sentence is 'open to collateral attack.' As a remedy, it is intended to be as broad as habeas corpus.'14\n\n\n18\nNo miscroscopic reading of \u00a7 2255 can escape either the clear and simple language of \u00a7 2254 authorizing habeas corpus relief 'on the ground that (the prisoner) is in custody in violation of the . . . laws . . . of the United States' or the unambiguous legislative history showing that \u00a7 2255 was intended to mirror \u00a7 2254 in operative effect. Thus, we cannot agree that the third paragraph of \u00a7 2255 was in any fashion designed to mark a retreat from the clear statement that \u00a7 2255 encompasses a prisoner's claim of 'the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States.' Accordingly, we conclude that the text of the statute cannot sustain the Government's position that only claims 'of constitutional dimension' are cognizable under \u00a7 2255.\n\n\n19\nMoreover, there is no support in the prior holdings of this Court for the proposition that a claim is not cognizable under \u00a7 2255 merely because it is grounded in the 'laws of the United States' rather than the Constitution. It is true, of course, that in Sunal v. Large, 332 U.S. 174, 67 S.Ct. 1588, 91 L.Ed. 1982 (1947), the Court held that the nonconstitutional claim in that case could not be asserted to set aside a conviction on collateral attack. But Sunal was merely an example of 'the general rule . . . that the writ of habeas corpus will not be allowed to do service for an appeal.' Id., at 178, 67 S.Ct., at 1950. 'Appeals could have been taken in these cases, but they were not.' Id., at 177, 67 S.Ct., at 1590. The Court was careful to point out that 'if Sunal and Kulick had pursued the appellate course and failed, their cases would be quite different. But since they chose not to pursue the remedy which they had, we do not think they should now be allowed to justify their failure by saying they deemed any appeal futile.' Id., at 181, 67 S.Ct., at 1592. Moreover, '(t)he case (was) not one where the law was changed after the time for appeal had expired.' Ibid. Thus, Sunal cannot be read to stand for the broad proposition that nonconstitutional claims can never be asserted in collateral attacks upon criminal convictions.15 Rather, the implication would seem to be that, absent the particular considerations regarded as dispositive in that case, the fact that a contention is grounded not in the Constitution, but in the 'laws of the United States' would not preclude its assertion in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding.\n\n\n20\nThis is not to say, however, that every asserted error of law can be raised stitution, but in the 'laws of the United States, 368 U.S. 424, 429, 82 S.Ct. 468, 472, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962), for example, we held that 'collateral relief is not available when all that is shown is a failure to comply with the formal requirements' of a rule of criminal procedure in the absence of any indication that the defendant was prejudiced by the asserted technical error. We suggested that the appropriate inquiry was whether the claimed error of law was 'a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice,' and whether '(i)t . . . present(s) exceptional circumstances where the need for the remedy afforded by the writ of habeas corpus is apparent.' Id., at 428, 82 S.Ct., at 471 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court did not suggest that any line could be drawn on the basis of whether the claim had its source in the Constitution or in the 'laws of the United States.'\n\n\n21\nIn this case, the petitioner's contention is that the decision in Gutknecht v. United States, as interpreted and applied by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in the Fox case after his conviction was affirmed, establishes that his induction order was invalid under the Selective Service Act and that he could not be lawfully convicted for failure to comply with that order. If this contention is well taken, then Davis' conviction and punishment are for an act that the law does not make criminal. There can be no room for doubt that such a circumstance 'inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice' and 'present(s) exceptional circumstances' that justify collateral relief under \u00a7 2255. Therefore, although we express no view on the merits of the petitioner's claim, we hold that the issue he raises is cognizable in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding.\n\n\n22\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n23\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n24\nJudgment of Court of Appeals reversed and case remanded.\n\n\n25\nMr. Justice POWELL, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\n26\nI agree with the Court's holding that review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is available to petitioner, due to the intervening change in the law of the Circuit. But I would dispose of the case finally, not remand it.\n\n\n27\nPetitioner's case turns on whether his conviction for refusing induction has been invalidated by Gutknecht v. United States, 396 U.S. 295, 90 S.Ct. 506, 24 L.Ed.2d 532 (1970). Both parties have raised, briefed and argued this issue, and it is properly before us. We should, in the interest of judicial economy if for no other reason, decide the Gutknecht issue and bring to an end this lengthy litigation, rather than remand it to the Court of Appeals for that court's fourth round of consideration.\n\n\n28\nIn my view, petitioner's reliance upon Gutknecht is misplaced. Petitioner reads Gutknecht as invalidating the former delinquency regulations of the Selective Service System in every possible application.1 He espouses a per se rule under which any induction order that derived from an application of those delinquency regulations is illegal. Gutknecht does not have such a broad sweep.\n\n\n29\nIn Gutknecht, the registrant was declared a delinquent for failing to retain his registration and classification papers in his possession at all times. He had surrendered these papers in an act of protect against the Vietnam conflict. As a consequence of the delinquency declaration, he was rushed\u2014indeed it might be said railroaded\u2014to induction. The entire process lasted less than two months, and Gutknecht was issued an induction order on the day after Christmas, only six days after he had been declared a delinquent. He was deprived of his standing in the order of call and was truly 'accelerated' in that he was ordered to induction prior to the date on which he would have been called if treated in the normal manner. Gutknecht, in essence, was caught upon the tide of punitive actions by the Selective Service System in the late 1960's against those who were thought to be avading military service because of opposition to the Vietnam conflict.\n\n\n30\nThe Court's opinion in Gutknecht repeatedly refers to this deliberately punitive attitude of the Service and its use of the then prevailing delinquency regulations as a means, short of criminal prosecution, for dealing with such persons. See, e.g., 396 U.S., at 306\u2014308, 90 S.Ct., at 511\u2014512. But I do not read Gutknecht as overturning the former delinquency regulations in all circumstances, or as depriving boards of a reasonable and effective alternative procedure for dealing with recalcitrant registrants who plainly were seeking to avoid military service. If the stated rationale of the holding in Guknecht is accepted, that case invalidated those regulations only insofar as they were applied punitively to advance the date of a registrant's induction or to deprive him of procedural rights, that he had not waived. See United States v. Dobie, 444 F.2d 417 (CA4 1971). The reasons relied upon by the Court in Gutknecht and in the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Stewart, 396 U.S., at 314, 90 S.Ct., at 515, are incompatible with a per se rule proscribing all board authority to order an evasive registrant to report for induction. Thus, in my view, United States v. Fox, 454 F.2d 593 (CA9 1971), on which Davis relies, was incorrectly decided.\n\n\n31\nIn the instant case it is undisputed that Davis was not, as a result of being declared delinquent, ordered to report for induction at a point in time prior to the normal order of his call. Indeed, due to the board's patient efforts to deal with Davis' repeated attempts to obstruct the induction process, Davis was ordered to report for induction some seven months later than would have been the case if the process had been allowed to function normally. There is no hint of vindictiveness or of an attempt to punish Davis.\n\n\n32\nThe only impact on Davis of being declared delinquent, other than a delay in the issuance of an order to report for induction, was that the declaration of delinquency permitted the board under then prevailing regulations to issue an induction order in the absence of a pre-induction physical examination and of the resulting form letter notifying Davis of his acceptability for service.2 Davis attempts to portray these preconditions on induction as significant procedural rights of which he was unfairly deprived by the board. The argument is frivolous. Davis frustrated every effort of the board over a period of more than two years to accord him the right to a physical examination. Thus he waived the procedural rights on which he now seeks to rely. Moreover, he would have received such an examination in any event if he had reported for induction. And the form notifying a registrant of acceptability for service is hardly a matter of major moment, particularly to one who had long been on notice of the pendency of an induction order.\n\n\n33\nOn the record in this case, no one could seriously contend that Davis was the victim of punitive action or that he was not treated with tolerance and forbearance. In my view, the Court in Gutknecht could hardly have intended to invalidate an induction order in such circumstances.\n\n\n34\nI would affirm the judgment.\n\n\n35\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting.\n\n\n36\nThe Court today holds, with a minimum of discussion, that petitioner, in a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, may rise his claim that his induction into the Armed Forces was accelerated contrary to the principles of Gutknecht v. United States, 396 U.S. 295, 90 S.Ct. 506, 24 L.Ed.2d 532 (1970). The Court reaches this result despite the fact that a United States District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit previously considered this contention in light of Gutknecht and concluded that petitioner's induction had not in fact been accelerated. As a justification for the decision this Court suggests that a \u00a7 2255 motion is both permissible and appropriate because a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has rendered a subsequent decision which adopts a new legal test for determining whether acceleration has occurred and which, if applied to petitioner, would probably change the outcome of his case. Since I believe the Court's decision is justified neither by the language of \u00a7 2255 itself nor by any prior case decided by this Court, and since I believe the potential consequences of the decision are harmful to the administration of justice, I dissent.\n\n\n37\n* The Court's conclusion, discussed infra, that claims such as petitioner's can be raised on a \u00a7 2255 motion, is actually unnecessary for the disposition of this case. The decisions of the District Court and the Court of Appeals rested entirely on application of a 'law of the case' theory, a position that the Government now disavows and that the Court disposes of in a single paragraph. The petitioner in his petition for certiorari and in his brief on the merits principally addressed that issue and his sole rebuttal of the Government's contention that nonconstitutional attacks on judgments of conviction are not cognizable in \u00a7 2255 proceedings is contained in his reply brief where he devotes one paragraph to arguing that his claim is constitutional. Thus the Court reaches out to decide a highly important issue without the benefit of lower court attention to the question, without full briefing, and, in my view, without full examination of the issues involved. It would seem preferable to remand this case, as the Court does anyway, without deciding this issue, allowing further consideration of the question below and leaving our venture into this area for a more appropriate occasion. Since the Court declines to do so, however, I will also address the broader question to which the Court proceeds.\n\nII\n\n38\nThe facts of this case are set out in detail in the Court's opinion. I review them here briefly only to emphasize the extent of both administrative and judicial consideration which petitioner has received. A mere recounting of the facts dispels the notion that there are any equities whatever in support of petitioner's claim for relief.\n\n\n39\nPetitioner's difficulties with the Selective Service System began in February of 1965 when he was classified I\u2014A by his local draft board. At that time he was ordered to report for a pre-induction physical examination, but did not appear on the specified date. The board then attempted to schedule another physical but was frustrated by petitioner's failure to advise the board of his whereabouts. At this point the board warned petitioner that he was in danger of being declared a delinquent, but this warning was also returned with the notation 'addressee unknown.'\n\n\n40\nThe board made one more unsuccessful attempt to communicate with petitioner and then declared him a delinquent according to the regulations then in effect.1 After a brief interval the board then mailed petitioner, not a third notice to report for a physical examination, but rather a notice to report for induction. This order having been returned stamped 'addressee unknown,' the board followed up by sending petitioner a second notice to report for induction which he apparently received. He did not report, however, and was then prosecuted for this refusal.\n\n\n41\nAll parties to this case concede that Selective Service registrants who are not declared delinquents are not mailed orders of induction before they have taken a physical examination. Without the delinquency classification, which allowed the board to issue an induction order without having given a physical examination, the board would have been faced with one of two alternatives. It could have prosecuted the petitioner for failure to take the physical examination or, alternatively, it could have continued the obviously futile mailing of additional notices concerning the physical. The delinquency procedure enabled the board to bypass those two undesirable options, and, in effect, provided for a temporary waiver of the examination until the time stated in the induction order. It should be noted that this procedure does not allow the board to induct anyone without a physical examination; rather it simply allows the board to call persons for induction prior to the time an examination is given.2\n\n\n42\nHaving been convicted in the District Court, petitioner took a direct appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. While the appeal was pending in that court, however, this Court decided Gutknecht, and the Court of Appeals then remanded the case to the District Court for further consideration in light of our decision. On remand, the District Court decided that Gutknecht did not apply because petitioner's induction had not in fact been accelerated.3 The court also found that '(d)efendant's substantial rights were not prejudiced by the Local Board's ordering him to report for induction without first giving him a physical examination and sending him a Notice of Acceptability,'4 because '(t)he failure to give such an examination and such Notice of Acceptability were (sic) caused by defendant's own failure to report for physical examination on October 8, 1965, as ordered.'5 The Court of Appeals agreed that Gutknecht did not control this case and affirmed.6 We denied certiorari.7\n\n\n43\nAlthough one might have supposed the proceedings to be closed at this point, our denial of certiorari marked only the end of phase one. For petitioner, having failed on his direct attack, then sought relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, presenting the same claims of acceleration which had previously been rejected. The principal basis for petitioner's motion was that the law of the Ninth Circuit, unfavorable to him at the time of his conviction and appeal, had subsequently been charged in United States v. Fox, 454 F.2d 593 (1971). The District Court denied relief without comment, and the Court of Appeals again affirmed.8 Stating that '(t)he decision on the direct appeal is the law of the case,'9 that court also noted specifically 'that Fox does not even suggest overruling Davis,'10 and further that 'the new law, or change in law, rule is not applied in this circuit under circumstances such as here presented. Odom v. United States, supra (9 Cir., 455 F.2d 159).'11 Again one would suppose that the dispute had reached its end, but this Court today decrees otherwise, remanding it for yet more consideration by the courts below.\n\nIII\n\n44\nFor reasons that I frankly do not understand, the Court seems to believe that the question of whether claims such as petitioner's may be raised in a motion under \u00a7 2255 is either largely settled by \u00a7 2255 itself and by earlier decisions of this Court or, perhaps, is too inconsequential to require extended treatment. Neither premise is sound. Both the language of \u00a7 2255 and the case law of this Court suggest that the issue is very much in doubt, and the potential consequences of the decision suggest that the matter calls for serious and careful consideration.\n\n\n45\nIn deciding whether claims of this type may be raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion, the logical starting place is the statute itself. The Court's opinion, however, gives the statute only a passing nod, apparently believing that ambiguity is best resolved by ignoring the source from which it arises. I believe the statute and the Court's treatment of it require a closer look.\n\n\n46\nThe Court begins its discussion of the statute by stating: 'At the outset, we note that the Government's position finds scant support in the text of \u00a7 2255, which permits a federal prisoner to assert a claim that his confinement is 'in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States.\"12 (Emphasis in Court's opinion.) The language quoted by the Court is taken from the first paragraph of \u00a7 2255 which reads: sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or      is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court      which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct      the sentence.'\n\n\n47\nThat paragraph, however, does not speak of an illegal 'confinement,' as suggested by the Court, or even an illegal conviction, but rather of illegal sentences. Furthermore, the paragraph is concerned only with motions for relief, not with the Court's power to grant relief. The power to grant relief is instead governed by the more specific provisions of paragraph three of the statute.\n\n\n48\nThe language of paragraph three differs quite strikingly from the language quoted above. After providing for notice and a hearing in appropriate cases, the paragraph continues:\n\n\n49\n'If the court finds that the judgment was rendered without      jurisdiction, or that the sentence imposed was not authorized      by law or otherwise open to collateral attack, or that there      has been such a denial or infringement of the constitutional      rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment vulnerable      to collateral attack, the court shall vacate and set the      judgment aside and shall discharge the prisoner or resentence      him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may      appear appropriate.'\n\n\n50\nThis language certainly makes less clear the intended scope of paragraph one, since, contrary to the emphasis on 'sentence' in the earlier paragraph, the provisions of paragraph three mention 'sentence' which may be set aside only twice, and then in connection with those 'not authorized by law or otherwise open to collateral attack . . ..'13 More importantly, the paragraph makes no mention of judgments rendered in violation of the laws of the United States. Rather the paragraph permits relief only where 'there has been such a denial or infringement of the constitutional rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment vulnerable to collateral attack . . ..' (Emphasis added.) Thus a disrict court may grant relief under this section only where (1) the judgment rendered was without jurisdiction; (2) the sentence was not authorized by law or is otherwise open to collateral attack; or (3) there has been such a denial of constitutional rights as to render the judgment vulnerable to collateral attack. Petitioner's case does not even arguably meet any one of these tests: the District Court clearly had jurisdiction to render a judgment of conviction; the sentence was concededly within the limits authorized by law and not otherwise vulnerable; and the Court apparently accepts the fact that petitioner has not presented a constitutional claim against the judgment. Nothing in the more generalized reference to 'laws of the United States' in the first paragraph of \u00a7 2255, therefore, can redeem petitioner's complete failure to bring himself within the operative language of the third paragraph.14\n\n\n51\nThe Court, however, strongly suggests that its opinion could rest upon the provision of paragraph three providing relief for 'sentence(s) . . . otherwise open to collateral attack.' This suggestion only compounds the confusion. To begin with, it seems odd that the Court chooses to bypass the language of that same sentence dealing with sentences (rather than judgments) 'not authorized by law' since that language far more closely parallels the language from the first paragraph cited by the Court. But, in any event, reading words 'otherwise open to collateral attack' as simply a catch-all phrase, including any recognizable ground for upsetting convictions on direct appeal makes it difficult to see why Congress then bothered to include the separate provision allowing relief when 'there has been such a denial or infringement of the constitutional rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment vulnerable to collateral attack . . ..' The Court could not reasonably argue that this provision in intended to give additional protection to constitutional rights because the Court purports to find no distinction in the statute between constitutional and nonconstitutional attacks on judgments of conviction.\n\n\n52\nBut assuming for the moment that the Court's approach is correct, I find a second obstacle to this decision in the definition, or lack of definition, of the word 'laws.' For though the Court seems to accept that petitioner has stated a recognizable claim that his sentence was somehow imposed in violation of the laws of the United States, the Court only briefly mentions what law the sentence is thought to be in violation of. Certainly petitioner cannot contend that where the constitution, treaties, or statutes of for refusing to report for induction is in violation of that section. Nor does he point to any other statutory provision which prohibits his incarceration for that offense. Therefore the basis for the claim, as the Court seems to believe, lies somewhere in the holdings of this Court in Gutknecht and of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Fox. The inclusion of either of these decisions in the category of 'laws of the United States' merits some additional attention.\n\n\n53\nThe term 'laws of the United States' was included in \u00a7 2255 presumably to continue its traditional place in federal habeas corpus statutes.15 The Habeas Corpus Act of 1867, c. 28, 14 Stat. 385, gave federal courts the power to grant writs of habeas corpus in all cases where any person may be restrained of his or her liberty 'in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or law of the United States . . ..' This language was carried forward in Rev.Stat. \u00a7 753 and now in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(c)(3) and 2254 where the word 'law' has been changed to 'laws.' He same phrasing has now been incorporated into \u00a7 2255. But the term's longevity has not brought with it a corresponding judicial elucidation. Like many other issues in the field of habeas corpus, the question seems to have been left for decision on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\n54\nCertainly a creditable argument could be made that the term 'laws' applies only to federal statutes, not to individual decisions of the federal courts. In 1842, for example, only 25 years before the Habeas Corpus Act was passed, this Court stated: 'In the ordinary use of language it will hardly be contended that the decisions of Courts constitute laws.' Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, 18, 10 L.Ed. 865.16 But even if some allowance for judicial lawmaking is made, the question in this case is not settled. For, if the law be Gutknecht, then the Court's 'new law' argument immediately disappears. Petitioner had a full opportunity to argue the applicability of Gutknecht on remand from his first appeal, and both the District Court and Court of Appeals found that it was not controlling. Since that time no decision of this Court has modified Gutknecht in any way which would now bring petitioner within its scope. Thus the real focus of petitioner's argument must be that Fox is the governing law. But in that regard, I cannot see why a decision by a single panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit should be considered a 'law' of the United States. In fact the Court of Appeals itself stated that its decision in Fox had not overruled Davis, pointing out that an en banc decision of the Court of Appeals would be necessary for such a result. Thus the Court today categorizes as a 'law of the United Sates' a decision which is still open to question within the Court of Appeals' own jurisdiction.\n\n\n55\nThe Court gives no indication of where this loose process of definition will end. It would certainly be surprising if a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, for example, were sufficient to give prisoners in the Ninth Circuit grounds for a $2255 motion, but it is not clear to me why a decision of the Fourth Circuit is any less a law of the United States than a decision of the Ninth Circuit. Concededly, it need not be considered binding on the Ninth Circuit, but that is not the concern under \u00a7 2255. Nor is it obvious to me what the Court would require a court of appeals to do when intracircuit conflicts arise. The decision today would seem to compel the Court to give a defendant already convicted according to one statutory interpretation the benefit of any more liberal interpretation which might emerge. This erratic process of interpretation finds no warrant in \u00a7 2255.\n\nIV\n\n56\nThe Court's lack of attention to the statutory language in this case is more than matched by the sparsity of the case law it cites. Although the Court seems to accept without question that both relief under \u00a7 2255 and habeas corpus relief have long been available to prisoners making nonconstitutional attacks on judgments of conviction, the Court cites not a single case from this Court that so holds.17 Certainly neither Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963), nor Kaufman v. United States, 394 U.S. 217, 89 S.Ct. 1068, 22 L.Ed.2d 227 (1969), the two most significant \u00a7 2255 decisions in recent years, is controlling on the important issue presented here, for both decisions involved completely different factual situations and considerations.18 Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. 424, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962), a third important case under \u00a7 2255 and one cited by the Court in its opinion, would seem to cut against the Court's position. In Hill the Court held that a failure to follow the requirements of Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 32(a), a rule promulgated under the auspices of a federal statute, was not the type of error which could be raised on a \u00a7 2255 motion. The Court stated:\n\n\n57\n'The failure of a trial court to ask a defendant represented      by an attorney whether he has anything to say before sentence is imposed is not of itself an error      of the character or magnitude cognizable under a writ of      habeas corpus. It is an error which is neither jurisdictional      nor constitutional. It is not a fundamental defect which      inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice, nor      an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair      procedure. It does not present 'exceptional circumstances      where the need for the remedy afforded by the writ of habeas      corpus is apparent.\" 368 U.S., at 428, 82 S.Ct., at 471.      (Emphasis added; citations omitted.)\n\n\n58\nThe only other case mentioned by the Court which might be relevant to this issue is Sunal v. Large, 332 U.S. 174, 67 S.Ct. 1588, 91 L.Ed. 1982 (1947), a case like Hill in which this Court denied relief for a claim with no constitutional foundation. The Court today suggests, by stress on a negative pregnant, that the decision to deny habeas corpus relief in that case was grounded solely on the petitioner's failure to raise his claim on direct appeal and that if the issue had been properly raised, the Court would have reached a different conclusion. It is true, of course, that collateral relief is not to be employed as a substitute for an appeal, and Sunal is a leading case for that proposition. But a reading of Sunal which recognizes only the effect of failure to appeal is unnecessarily grudging. The Court in Hill, for example, although faced with a situation in which the noncompliance with Rule 32(a) was not raised on appeal, did not imply that the error could have been raised in \u00a7 2255 proceedings if an appeal had been taken. Rather the Court stated flatly: 'We hold that the failure to follow the formal requirements of Rule 32(a) is not of itself an error that can be raised by collateral attack . . ..' 368 U.S., at 426, 82 S.Ct., at 468.\n\n\n59\nAlthough the scope of relief in a habeas corpus proceeding remains largely undefined, probably out of concern that definition would introduce unwanted limitation, the judicial expansion of the federal courts' habeas power had not previously reached the type of claim asserted here. Certainly Mr. Justice Frankfurter's catalogue in Sunal, supra, 332 U.S., at 185\u2014186, 67 S.Ct., at 1594\u20141595 (dissenting opinion), makes no mention of such grounds. And there is no dearth of authority to the effect that federal habeas corpus is not available merely to correct errors of law.19 Many decisions of lower federal courts have at least implicitly limited collateral relief to claims of constitutional stature.20\n\n\n60\nThe lack of foundation from which the Court now proceeds to fashion a new, expansive collateral-relief doctrine unfortunately suggests that the Court is prepared to extend or retract, relief on the basis of whether a majority of the Court believes that a particular set of factual circumstances is 'exceptional' or that a particular litigant has raised an appealing point. Thus, the petitioner in Hill is barred from raising his claim at all in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding because failure to comply with an explicit federal rule is 'not of itself an error of the character or magnitude cognizable under a writ of habeas corpus.' The petitioner in Sunal is also barred, despite a 'far more compelling' claim than the one raised in Hill, see 368 U.S., at 428, 82 S.Ct., at 471, apparently because he did not receive a previous rejection of his claim on direct appeal. but petitioner in this case succeeds. According to the Court, this case is different, for petitioner has already had his precise claim decided against him once, curiously enough a circumstance considered favorable for him, and because '(t)here can be no room for doubt that such a circumstance (conviction for failure to obey a possibly invalid order) 'inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice' and 'present(s) exceptional circumstances' that justify collateral relief under \u00a7 2255.' It is difficult to see that this process of selection rests upon any reasoned distinctions which may be derived from either the statute or the cases.\n\nV\n\n61\nThe Court's rather brief dismissal of the Government's arguments in this case might be understandable were the issues of less importance, or the result less likely to produce severe repercussions. After all, the scope of \u00a7 2255 relief has been undefined for almost 25 years and it might be supposed that continuation of this state of affairs would cause no unusual difficulties. But the potential consequences of the Court's decision today make a laissez-faire attitude inappropriate. For, '(a)ssuming that there 'exists,' in an ultimate sense, a 'correct' decision of a question of law, we can never be assured that any particular tribunal has in the past made it: we can always continue to ask whether the right rule was applied, whether a new rule should not have been fashioned.' Bator, Finality in Criminal Law and Federal Habeas Corpus for State Prisoners, 76 Harv.L.Rev. 441, 447 (1963). Two examples will suffice as illustrations.\n\n\n62\n(1) This Court occasionally, though not with great frequency, is called upon to resolve conflicts among the courts of appeals on nonconstitutional criminal questions. For example, in January of 1974, the Court decided United States v. Maze, 414 U.S. 395, 94 S.Ct. 645, 38 L.Ed.2d 603, a case in which we were asked to resolve a conflict among the courts of appeals concerning the circumstances under which fraudulent use of a credit card might violate the federal mail fraud statute. The Courts of Appeals for the Sixth and Tenth Circuits had construed the scope of the statute somewhat more narrowly than five other courts of appeals. In Maze we approved the minority approach, agreeing with the Sixth Circuit that the respondent's conviction under the mail fraud statute should be reversed.\n\n\n63\nThe Court's decision today seems to provide full opportunity for all defendants convicted under the Mail Fraud Act in the circuits whose view was not accepted to relitigate those convictions in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. Most of those convictions have received full appellate review, and many defendants had unsuccessfully sought certiorari in this Court. The district courts, faced with this influx of motions, will be faced with the difficult task of sifting through various factual claims to determine if the principles of Maze should be applied. I suspect that the burden will not be inconsiderable.\n\n\n64\n(2) The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in affirming the dismissal of petitioner's \u00a7 2255 motion, cited its own decision in Odom v. United States, 455 F.2d 159 (1972). That case involved the question of whether the petitioner was entitled to the benefit of Wade v. United States, 426 F.2d 64 (1970), a case which had established new law on insanity for the Ninth Circuit. At the time Wade was decided the Court of Appeals specifically held that the decision should apply only to 'convictions (which) have not become final as of the date of this decision.'21 Under my reading of the Court's opinion in this case, however, petitioner Odom and anyone else who had raised an insanity defense in the Ninth Circuit may now proceed to file \u00a7 2255 motions in the District court. For Davis' conviction was as final as Odom's conviction, and no basis is evident for saying that one decision is less a 'law of the United States' than the other.\n\n\n65\nThe effect will be twofold. First, federal courts which are already overburdened with cases will find that burden increased. As Mr. Justice Jackson noted in Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 537, 73 S.Ct. 397, 425, 97 L.Ed. 469 (1953) (concurring in result): 'It must prejudice the occasional meritorious application to be buried in a flood of worthless ones.' Second, there will be substantial disincentive for federal courts to overthrow settled doctrines, no matter how salutary new ones might seem. Although enlightened jurisprudence may call for adopting new policies or correcting errors of interpretation, any court considering such changes must be constantly aware that numerous final convictions will thereupon be placed in jeopardy. The possible, and often undeserved, advantage to a particular litigant is thus obtained at a cost to the entire judicial system.\n\n\n66\nThese examples unfortunately may be multiplied. Admittedly, the Court does attempt to set a minimum threshold for such claims, requiring \"a fundamental defect inherently result(ing) in a complete miscarriage of justice,\" and \"exceptional circumstances where the need for the remedy afforded by the writ of habeas corpus is apparent.\" (Ante, at 346). This dictum, it is hoped, will partially offset the effect of the holding in this case, though if this petitioner's case represents a miscarriage of justice it is hard to imagine one that does not. But one must be concerned that the Court, having taken this giant step so casually, may find the next step equally easy to take, allowing perhaps challenges to evidentiary rulings and other trial matters heretofore considered inappropriate for federal habeas corpus.\n\nVI\n\n67\nThe decision in this case cannot reasonably be explained by the maxim 'Hard cases make bad law,' for although the law made is bad the case is not hard. Whatever reason there might be to strain the contours of \u00a7 2255 to permit relief to someone visited with obvious injustice, the fact is that this petitioner has had full opportunity to make his case at every stage of the way. He has alleged no deprivation of his rights to a full and fair hearing at trial, no deprivation of his right to appeal, no inability to get adequate consideration on appellate review. He simply alleges that had his case been appealed at a different time he would have won it. I cannot find that those circumstances are so exceptional as to warrant the result reached today.\n\n\n68\nI therefore dissent from the Court's opinion. Were I persuaded otherwise, on that score, however, I would nonetheless agree for the reasons stated in Mr. Justice POWELL in his concurring and dissenting opinion, ante, p. 347, that the judgment should be affirmed.\n\n\n\n1\n The notice further stated that '(a) delinquent registrant loses his eligibility for deferment and may be placed in a class immediately available for service. He is ordered for induction ahead of other registrants.' Pet. for Cert. 21a.\n\n\n2\n This regulation, which was rescinded shortly after our decision in Gutknecht v. United States, 396 U.S. 295, 90 S.Ct. 506, 24 L.Ed.2d 532 (1970), provided in pertinent part: '(a) Whenever a registrant has failed to perform any duty or duties required of him under the selective service law other than the duty to comply with an Order to Report for Induction . . . or the duty to comply with an Order to Report for Civilian Work . . ., the local board may declare him to be a delinquent.'\n\n\n3\n Title 32 CFR \u00a7 1641.4 imposes a duty on every registrant to report for an Armed Forces physical examination at the time and place fixed in the order mailed to the registrant by the board. Title 32 CFR \u00a7 1641.1 imposes a duty on every registrant 'to keep his local board currently informed in writing of . . . the address where mail will reach him . . ..'\n\n\n4\n Title 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 462(a) provides, in pertinent part, that 'any person . . . who in any manner shall knowingly fail or neglect or refuse to perform any duty required of him under or in the execution of this title, or rules, regulations, or directions made pursuant to this title . . . shall, upon conviction in any district court of the United States of competent jurisdiction, be punished by imprisonment for not more than five years or a fine of not more than $10,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment.' Title 32 CFR \u00a7 1641.5 imposes a duty on every registrant 'to report for induction at the time and place ordered by the local board.'\n\n\n5\n Both induction orders sent to the petitioner had the word 'Delinquent' typed on the face. The local board's 'Minutes of Action' also reflect that the petitioner was ordered to report 'as Del.'\n\n\n6\n Title 32 CFR \u00a7 1631.7 (1967) established an order in which registrants who were eligible would be called for induction. A registrant's place in this order of call was determined by several factors, including age and marital status. If a registrant were declared a delinquent under 32 CFR \u00a7 1642.4 (1967), he immediately entered the first priority in the order of call and was ordered to report for induction even ahead of volunteers for induction. In this sense, the registrant's induction was 'accelerated' as a result of the local board's delinquency declaration.\n\n\n7\n Gutknecht had been declared a delinquent for failing to have his registration certificate and current classification notice in his possession at all times, as required by 32 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 1617.1 and 1623.5, respectively.\n\n\n8\n In this regard, the Court said:\n'The power under the regulations to declare a registrant 'delinquent' has no statutory standard or even guidelines. The power is exercised entirely at the discretion of the local board. It is a broad, roving authority, a type of administrative absolutism not congenial to our law-making traditions. . . . We search the Act in vain for any clues that Congress desired the Act to have punitive sanctions apart from the criminal prosecutions specifically authorized . . .. If federal or state laws are violated by registrants, they can be prosecuted. If induction is to be substituted for these prosecutions, a vast rewriting of the Act is needed.' 396 U.S., at 306\u2014307, 90 S.Ct., at 511.\n\n\n9\n At the hearing in the District Court, the executive secretary of the local board testified that the petitioner would have been inducted earlier if he had not failed to appear for the physical. In corroboration, the Government introduced the local board's 'delivery lists' showing the induction dates of other registrants at the local board. The District Court found that if the petitioner had complied with the local board's procedures and '(h)ad . . . not been declared a Delinquent, he would have been ordered to report for induction on or before November 15, 1966,' which would have been nearly eight months before he finally failed to report (July 11, 1967).\n\n\n10\n Between the dates of the induction orders of Davis and Fox, the provisions of 32 CFR \u00a7 1631.7(a) (1967) were incorporated into 32 CFR \u00a7 1631.7(b) (1969).\n\n\n11\n At the time of his \u00a7 2255 motion in the District Court, Davis also moved under Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 35 for reduction or modification of his sentence. This motion was taken under advisement by the District Court and was thereafter granted in part. As a result, the petitioner was released from incarceration after having served four months of his three-year sentence, and he was placed on probation for the remainder of the original term.\n\n\n12\n In the absence of a decision by the Court of Appeals on the merits of the petitioner's contentions, this case is not an appropriate vehicle to consider whether the Gutknecht decision has retroactive application or whether the Fox case was correctly decided by the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n13\n Brief for United States 25 n. 11.\n\n\n14\n United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 217, 72 S.Ct. 263, 271, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952).\n\n\n15\n Although Sunal held that a federal prisoner could not assert a nonconstitutional claim on collateral attack if he had not raised it on appeal, the Court there recognized that this rule would not bar the assertion of constitutional claims in collateral proceedings even if the applicant had failed to pursue them on appeal. 332 U.S. 174, 178\u2014179, 182, 67 S.Ct. 1588, 1590\u20141591, 1592, 91 L.Ed. 1982. Cf. Kaufman v. United States, 394 U.S. 217, 223, 89 S.Ct. 1068, 1072, 22 L.Ed.2d 227 (1969).\n\n\n1\n Gutknecht concerned primarily 32 CFR \u00a7 1642.13 (1969), now superseded, which assigned first priority in the order of induction to delinquents. That regulation is not at issue here.\n\n\n2\n Under 32 CFR \u00a7 1631.7 (1967), which has been withdrawn, the board could issue induction orders to those classified I\u2014A or I\u2014A\u2014O who had been (i) found acceptable for service and (ii) mailed a Statement of Acceptability at least 21 days before the date fixed for induction, provided:\n'That a registrant classified in Class I\u2014A or Class I\u2014A\u2014O who is delinquent may be selected and ordered to report for induction . . . notwithstanding the fact that he has not been found acceptable for service . . . and has not been mailed a Statement of Acceptability . . ..'\nDavis received his induction notice under this regulation. Davis maintains that Gutknecht invalidated the above proviso clause, thus depriving the Board of the power to induct him in the absence of a finding of acceptability (i.e., a pre-induction physical) and a Statement of Acceptability. But, as noted, Gutknecht dealt with punitive treatment of delinquents, not all treatment of such registrants. Moreover, the above regulation was not at issue in Gutknecht.\n\n\n1\n The particular regulation relied upon by the board was 32 CFR \u00a7 1642.4(a) (1967), which was rescinded after the Court's decision in Gutknecht v. United States, 396 U.S. 295, 90 S.Ct. 506, 24 L.Ed.2d 532 (1970).\n\n\n2\n The District Court specifically found that petitioner 'would have received a complete physical examination prior to induction had he reported on July 11, 1967, as ordered.' Pet. for Cert. 10a.\n\n\n3\n Id., at 9a.\n\n\n4\n Ibid.\n\n\n5\n Id., at 9a\u201410a.\n\n\n6\n 447 F.2d 1376.\n\n\n7\n 405 U.S. 933, 92 S.Ct. 939, 30 L.Ed.2d 809.\n\n\n8\n 472 F.2d 596.\n\n\n9\n Ibid.\n\n\n10\n Ibid.\n\n\n11\n Ibid.\n\n\n12\n Ante, at 342\u2014343.\n'A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established      by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the      ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the      Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court      was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the\n\n\n13\n The statute seems, at times, to use the terms 'sentence' and 'judgment' interchangeably, for paragraph three allows relief from judgments in specified instances while paragraph one would seem to allow attacks only on sentences. But the fact that no distinction is made between the terms in paragraph one does not mean that their contrasting use in paragraph three can automatically be deemed without significance. The Court should attempt to reach a reasonable interpretation based upon the particular context of the statute and the historical background of collateral relief, rather than simply abandoning the statute to study its legislative history. See, e.g., United States v. Sobell, 314 F.2d 314 (CA2), cert. denied, 374 U.S. 857, 83 S.Ct. 1906, 10 L.Ed.2d 1077 (1963).\n\n\n14\n It might be argued, of course, that the first paragraph of \u00a7 2255 was for some reason designed to permit the filing of motions for relief even in some cases where relief could not be granted under paragraph three. But the Court offers no reason, and I can think of none, why Congress would encourage such a futile exercise. What the Court has done is simply to read most of paragraph three out of the statute, apparently assuming that its more specific provisions have no function in a proper interpretation of \u00a7 2255.\n\n\n15\n Section 2255 was enacted to provide the same relief available under the federal habeas corpus statute without the logistical problems encountered in the latter remedy. United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952). The Court makes much of this fact in its opinion but then drops the issue without examining what constituted a 'law' for purposes of habeas corpus or what the scope of habeas corpus relief has proved to be under the decisions of this Court.\n\n\n16\n The Court in Swift v. Tyson, supra, was considering a section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, \u00a7 34, 1 Stat. 92, which stated, in part: '(T)he laws of the several states, except where the constitution, treaties, orstatutes of the United States shall otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law in the courts of the United States in cases where they apply.' The Court, in explaining its doubt that court decisions constituted 'laws' observed: 'They are, at most, only evidence of what the laws are, and not of themselves laws. They are often re-examined, reversed, and qualified by the Courts themselves, whenever they are found to be either defective, or ill-founded, or otherwise incorrect.' 16 Pet., at 18.\n\n\n17\n The Court, in fact, avoids the necessity for a closer look at the statutory language of \u00a7 2255 by turning instead to the provisions of the federal habeas statute as a guide. This reliance makes all the more curious the fact that the court does not support its view of the scope of federal habeas by any convincing citation of authority.\n\n\n18\n The Sanders Court's statement of the issue before it clearly demonstrates how different that case was from the one now under consideration. In Sanders the Court said: 'We consider here the standards which should guide a federal court in deciding whether to grant a hearing on a motion of a federal prisoner under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.' 373 U.S., at 2, 83 s.Ct., at 1070. That issue arises, not under paragraph one of \u00a7 2255, setting forth the claims which a prisoner might make, or under that part of paragraph three setting forth the grounds on which relief might be granted, but under the language found earlier in paragraph three dealing with when a hearing must be held. Thus, the Court in Sanders was faced with the question, not of whether a particular type of claim is cognizable at all in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, but simply whether a hearing is required on a claim concededly within the reach of that section.\nThe petitioner in Kaufman, in contrast to the petitioner here, sought relief on the ground that he had been subjected to an unconstitutional search and seizure. The Court's recognition of the constitutional tenor of his claim is evident throughout the opinion. For example, the Court clearly stated that 'the availability of collateral remedies is necessary to insure the integrity of proceedings at and before trial where constitutional rights are at stake,' 394 U.S., 225, 89 S.Ct., at 1073, (emphasis added), and that '(t)he provision of federal collateral remedies rests more fundamentally upon a recognition that adequate protection of constitutional rights relating to the criminal trial process requires the continuing availability of a mechanism for relief.' Id., at 226, 89 S.Ct., at 1074 (emphasis added).\n\n\n19\n See, e.g., Sunal v. Large, 332 U.S. 174, 179, 67 S.Ct. 1588, 1591, 91 L.Ed. 1982 (1947).\n\n\n20\n See, e.g., DeMaro v.

Uviller, New York City, for appellant.\nStanley Buchsbaum, Brooklyn, N.Y., for appellee.\nMr. Justice BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nConstitutional questions decided by this Court concerning the juvenile process have centered on the adjudicatory stage at 'which a determination is made as to whether a juvenile is a 'delinquent' as a result of alleged misconduct on his part, with the consequence that he may be committed to a state institution.' In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 13, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1436, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967). Gault decided that, although the Fourteenth Amendment does not require that the hearing at this stage conform with all the requirements of a criminal trial or even of the usual administrative proceeding, the Due Process Clause does require application during the adjudicatory hearing of \"the essentials of due process and fair treatment.\" Id., at 30, 87 S.Ct. at 1445. This case presents the single, narrow question whether proof beyond a reasonable doubt is among the 'essentials of due process and fair treatment' required during the adjudicatory stage when a juvenile is charged with an act which would constitute a crime if committed by an adult.1\n\n\n2\nSection 712 of the New York Family Court Act defines a juvenile delinquent as 'a person over seven and less than sixteen years of age who does any act which, if done by an adult, would constitute a crime.' During a 1967 adjudicatory hearing, conducted pursuant to \u00a7 742 of the Act, a judge in New York Family Court found that appellant, then a 12-year-old boy, had entered a locker and stolen $112 from a woman's pocketbook. The petition which charged appellant with delinquency alleged that his act, 'if done by an adult, would constitute the crime or crimes of Larceny.' The judge acknowledged that the proof might not establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but rejected appellant's contention that such proof was required by the Fourteenth Amendment. The judge relied instead on \u00a7 744(b) of the New York Family Court Act which provides that '(a)ny determination at the conclusion of (an adjudicatory) hearing that a (juvenile) did an act or acts must be based on a preponderance of the evidence.'2 During a subsequent dispositional hearing, appellant was ordered placed in a training school for an initial period of 18 months, subject to annual extensions of his commitment until his 18th birthday\u2014six years in appellant's case. The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, First Judicial Department, affirmed without opinion, 30 A.D.2d 781, 291 N.Y.S.2d 1005 (1968). The New York Court of Appeals then affirmed by a four-to-three vote, expressly sustaining the constitutionality of \u00a7 744(b), 24 N.Y.2d 196, 299 N.Y.S.2d 414, 247 N.W.2d 253 (1969).3 We noted probable jurisdiction 396 U.S. 885, 90 S.Ct. 179, 24 L.Ed.2d 160 (1969). We reverse.\n\n\n3\n* The requirement that guilt of a criminal charge be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt dates at least from our early years as a Nation. The 'demand for a higher degree of persuasion in criminal cases was recurrently expressed from ancient times, (though) its crystallization into the formula 'beyond a reasonable doubt' seems to have occurred as late as 1798. It is now accepted in common law jurisdictions as the measure of persuasion by which the prosecution must convince the trier of all the essential elements of guilt.' C. McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 321, pp. 681\u2014682 (1954); see also 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 2497 (3d ed. 1940). Although virtually unanimous adherence to the reasonable-doubt standard in common-law jurisdictions may not conclusively establish it as a requirement of due process, such adherence does 'reflect a profound judgment about the way in which law should be enforced and justice administered.' Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 155, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 1451, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968).\n\n\n4\nExpressions in many opinions of this Court indicate that it has long been assumed that proof of a criminal charge beyond a reasonable doubt is constitutionally required. See, for example, Miles v. United States, 103 U.S. 304, 312, 26 L.Ed. 481 (1881); Davis v. United States, 160 U.S. 469, 488, 16 S.Ct. 353, 358, 40 L.Ed. 499 (1895); Holt v. United States, 218 U.S. 245, 253, 31 S.Ct. 2, 6, 54 L.Ed. 1021 (1910); Wilson v. United States, 232 U.S. 563, 569\u2014570, 34 S.Ct. 347, 349, 350, 58 L.Ed. 728 (1914); Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 174, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1310, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949); Leland v. Oregon, 343 U.S. 790, 795, 72 S.Ct. 1002, 1005, 1006, 96 L.Ed. 1302 (1952); Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 138, 75 S.Ct. 127, 136, 137, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954); Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 525\u2014526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 1342, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958). Cf. Coffin v. United States, 156 U.S. 432, 15 S.Ct. 394, 39 L.Ed. 481 (1895). Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated that '(i)t the duty of the Government to establish * * * guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This notion\u2014basic in our law and rightly one of the boasts of a free society\u2014is a requirement and a safeguard of due process of law in the historic, procedural content of 'due process.\" Leland v. Oregon, supra, 343 U.S., at 802\u2014803, 72 S.Ct., at 1009 (dissenting opinion). In a similar vein, the Court said in Brinegar v. United States, supra, 338 U.S., at 174, 69 S.Ct., at 1310, that '(g)uilt in a criminal case must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and by evidence confined to that which long experience in the common-law tradition, to some extent embodied in the Constitution, has crystallized into rules of evidence consistent with that standard. These rules are historically grounded rights of our system, developed to safeguard men from dubious and unjust convictions, with resulting forfeitures of life, liberty and property.' Davis v. United States, supra, 160 U.S., at 488, 16 S.Ct., at 358 stated that the requirement is implicit in 'constitutions * * * (which) recognize the fundamental principles that are deemed essential for the protection of life and liberty.' In Davis a murder conviction was reversed because the trial judge instructed the jury that it was their duty to convict when the evidence was equally balanced regarding the sanity of the accused. This Court said: 'On the contrary, he is entitled to an acquittal of the specific crime charged, if upon all the evidence, there is reasonable doubt whether he was capable in law of committing crime. * * * No man should be deprived of his life under the forms of law unless the jurors who try him are able, upon their consciences, to say that the evidence before them * * * is sufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged.' Id., at 484, 493, 16 S.Ct., at 357, 360.\n\n\n5\nThe reasonable-doubt standard plays a vital role in the American scheme of criminal procedure. It is a prime instrument for reducing the risk of convictions resting on factual error. The standard provides concrete substance for the presumption of innocence\u2014that bedrock 'axiomatic and elementary' principle whose 'enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.' Coffin v. United States, supra, 156 U.S., at 453, 15 S.Ct., at 403. As the dissenters in the New York Court of Appeals observed, and we agree, 'a person accused of a crime * * * would be at a severe disadvantage, a disadvantage amounting to a lack of fundamental fairness, if he could be adjudged guilty and imprisoned for years on the strength of the same evidence as would suffice in a civil case.' 24 N.Y.2d, at 205, 299 N.Y.S.2d, at 422, 247 N.E.2d, at 259.\n\n\n6\nThe requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt has this vital role in our criminal procedure for cogent reasons. The accused during a criminal prosecution has at stake interest of immense importance, both because of the possibility that he may lose his liberty upon conviction and because of the certainty that he would be stigmatized by the conviction. Accordingly, a society that values the good name and freedom of every individual should not condemn a man for commission of a crime when there is reasonable doubt about his guilt. As we said in Speiser v. Randall, supra, 357 U.S., at 525\u2014526, 78 S.Ct., at 1342: 'There is always in litigation a margin of error, representing error in factfinding, which both parties must take into account. Where one party has at stake an interest of transcending value\u2014as a criminal defendant his liberty\u2014this margin of error is reduced as to him by the process of placing on the other party the burden of * * * persuading the factfinder at the conclusion of the trial of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Due process commands that no man shall lose his liberty unless the Government has borne the burden of * * * convincing the factfinder of his guilt.' To this end, the reasonable-doubt standard is indispensable, for it 'impresses on the trier of fact the necessity of reaching a subjective state of certitude of the facts in issue.' Dorsen & Rezneck, In Re Gault and the Future of Juvenile Law, 1 Family Law Quarterly, No. 4, pp. 1, 26 (1967).\n\n\n7\nMoreover, use of the reasonable-doubt standard is indispensable to command the respect and confidence of the community in applications of the criminal law. It is critical that the moral force of the criminal law not be diluted by a standard of proof that leaves people in doubt whether innocent men are being condemned. It is also important in our free society that every individual going about his ordinary affairs have confidence that his government cannot adjudge him guilty of a criminal offense without convincing a proper factfinder of his guilt with utmost certainty.\n\n\n8\nLest there remain any doubt about the constitutional stature of the reasonable-doubt standard, we explicitly hold that the Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\n\nII\n\n9\nWe turn to the question whether juveniles, like adults, are constitutionally entitled to proof beyond a reasonable doubt when they are charged with violation of a criminal law. The same considerations that demand extreme caution in factfinding to protect the innocent adult apply as well to the innocent child. We do not find convincing the contrary arguments of the New York Court of Appeals, Gault rendered untenable much of the reasoning relied upon by that court to sustain the constitutionality of \u00a7 744(b). The Court of Appeals indicated that a delinquency adjudication 'is not a 'conviction' (\u00a7 781); that it affects no right or privilege, including the right to hold public office or to obtain a license (\u00a7 782); and a cloak of protective confidentiality is thrown around all the proceedings (\u00a7\u00a7 783 784).' 24 N.Y.2d at 200, 299 N.Y.S.2d, at 417\u2014418, 247 N.E.2d, at 255\u2014256. The court said further: 'The delinquency status is not made a crime; and the proceedings are not criminal. There is, hence, no deprivation of due process in the statutory provision (challenged by appellant) * * *.' 24 N.Y.2d, at 203, 299 N.Y.S.2d, at 420, 247 N.E.2d, at 257. In effect the Court of Appeals distinguished the proceedings in question here from a criminal prosecution by use of what Gault called the \"civil' label-of-convenience which has been attached to juvenile proceedings.' 387 U.S., at 50, 87 S.Ct., at 1455. But Gault expressly rejected that distinction as a reason for holding the Due Process Clause inapplicable to a juvenile proceeding. 387 U.S., at 50\u201451, 87 S.Ct., at 1455, 1456. The Court of Appeals also attempted to justify the preponderance standard on the related ground that juvenile proceedings are designed 'not to punish, but to save the child.' 24 N.Y.2d, at 197, 299 N.Y.S.2d, at 415, 247 N.E.2d, at 254. Again, however, Gault expressly rejected this justification. 387 U.S., at 27, 87 S.Ct., at 1443. We made clear in that decision that civil labels and good intentions do not themselves obviate the need for criminal due process safeguards in juvenile courts, for '(a) proceeding where the issue is whether the child will be found to be 'delinquent' and subjected to the loss of his liberty for years is comparable in seriousness to a felony prosecution.' Id., at 36, 87 S.Ct., at 1448.\n\n\n10\nNor do we perceive any merit in the argument that to afford juveniles the protection of proof beyond a reasonable doubt would risk destruction of beneficial aspects of the juvenile process.4 Use of the reasonable-doubt standard during the adjudicatory hearing will not disturb New York's policies that a finding that a child has violated a criminal law does not constitute a criminal conviction, that such a finding does not deprive the child of his civil rights, and that juvenile proceedings are confidential. Nor will there be any effect on the informality, flexibility, or speed of the hearing at which the factfinding takes place. And the opportunity during the post-adjudicatory or dispositional hearing for a wide-ranging review of the child's social history and for his individualized treatment will remain unimpaired. Similarly, there will be no effect on the procedures distinctive to juvenile proceedings that are employed prior to the adjudicatory hearing.\n\n\n11\nThe Court of Appeals ovserved that 'a child's best interest is not necessarily, or even probably, promoted if he wins in the particular inquiry which may bring him to the juvenile court.' 24 N.Y.2d, at 199, 299 N.Y.S.2d, at 417, 247 N.E.2d, at 255. It is true, of course, that the juvenile may be engaging in a general course of conduct inimical to his welfare that calls for judicial intervention. But that intervention cannot take the form of subjecting the child to the stigma of a finding that he violated a criminal law5 and to the possibility of institutional confinement on proof insufficient to convict him were he an adult.\n\n\n12\nWe conclude, as we concluded regarding the essential due process safeguards applied in Gault, that the observance of the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt 'will not compel the States to abandon or displace any of the substantive benefits of the juvenile process.' Gault, supra, at 21, 87 S.Ct., at 1440.\n\n\n13\nFinally, we reject the Court of Appeals' suggestion that there is, in any event, only a 'tenuous difference' between the reasonable-doubt and preponderance standards. The suggestion is singularly unpersuasive. In this very case, the trial judge's ability to distinguish between the two standards enabled him to make a finding of guilt that he conceded he might not have made under the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Indeed, the trial judge's action evidences the accuracy of the observation of commentators that 'the preponderance test is susceptible to the misinterpretation that it calls on the trier of fact merely to perform an abstract weighing of the evidence in order to determine which side has produced the greater quantum, without regard to its effect in convincing his mind of the truth of the proposition asserted.' Dorsen & Rezneck, supra, at 26\u201427.6\n\nIII\n\n14\nIn sum, the constitutional safeguard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is as much required during the adjudicatory stage of a delinquency proceeding as are those constitutional safeguards applied in Gault\u2014notice of charges, right to counsel, the rights of confrontation and examination, and the privilege against self-incrimination. We therefore hold, in agreement with Chief Judge Fuld in dissent in the Court of Appeals, 'that, where a 12-year-old child is charged with an act of stealing which renders him liable to confinement for as long as six years, then, as a matter of due process * * * the case against him must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.' 24 N.Y.2d, at 207, 299 N.Y.S.2d, at 423, 247 N.E.2d, at 260.\n\n\n15\nReversed.\n\n\n16\nMr. Justice HARLAN, concurring.\n\n\n17\nNo one, I daresay, would contend that state juvenile court trials are subject to no federal constitutional limitations. Differences have existed, however, among the members of this Court as to what constitutional protections do apply. See In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967).\n\n\n18\nThe present case draws in question the validity of a New York statute that permits a determination of juvenile delinquency, founded on a charge of criminal conduct, to be made on a standard of proof that is less rigorous than that which would obtain had the accused been tried for the same conduct in an ordinary criminal case. While I am in full agreement that this statutory provision offends the requirement of fundamental fairness embodied in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, I am constrained to add something to what my Brother BRENNAN has written for the Court, lest the true nature of the constitutional problem presented become obscured or the impact on state juvenile court systems of what the Court holds today be exaggerated.\n\n\n19\n* Professor Wigmore, in discussing the various attempts by courts to define how convinced one must be to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, wryly observed: 'The truth is that no one has yet invented or discovered a mode of measurement for the intensity of human belief. Hence there can be yet no successful method of communicating intelligibly * * * a sound method of selfanalysis for one's belief,' 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence 325 (3d ed. 1940).1\n\n\n20\nNotwithstanding Professor Wigmore's skepticism, we have before us a case where the choice of the standard of proof has made a difference: the juvenile court judge below forthrightly acknowledged that he believed by a preponderance of the evidence, but was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant stole $112 from the complainant's pocketbook. Moreover, even though the labels used for alternative standards of proof are vague and not a very sure guide to decisionmaking, the choice of the standard for a particular variety of adjudication does, I think, reflect a very fundamental assessment of the comparative social costs of erroneous factual determinations.2\n\n\n21\nTo explain why I think this so, I begin by stating two propositions, neither of which I believe can be fairly disputed. First, in a judicial proceeding in which there is a dispute about the facts of some earlier event, the factfinder cannot acquire unassailably accurate knowledge of what happened. Instead, all the fact-finder can acquire is a belief of what probably happened. The intensity of this belief\u2014the degree to which a factfinder is convinced that a given act actually occurred\u2014can, of course, vary. In this regard, a standard of proof represents an attempt to instruct the fact-finder concerning the degree of confidence our society thinks he should have in the correctness of factual conclusions for a particular type of adjudication. Although the phrases 'preponderance of the evidence' and 'proof beyond a reasonable doubt' are quantitatively imprecise, they do communicate to the finder of fact different notions concerning the degree of confidence he is expected to have in the correctness of his factual conclusions.\n\n\n22\nA second proposition, which is really nothing more than a corollary of the first, is that the trier of fact will sometimes, despite his best efforts, be wrong in his factual conclusions. In a lawsuit between two parties, a factual error can make a difference in one of two ways. First, it can result in a judgment in favor of the plaintiff when the true facts warrant a judgment for the defendant. The analogue in a criminal case would be the conviction of an innocent man. On the other hand, an erroneous factual determination can result in a judgment for the defendant when the true facts justify a judgment in plaintiff's favor. The criminal analogue would be the acquittal of a guilty man.\n\n\n23\nThe standard of proof influences the relative frequency of these two types of erroneous outcomes. If, for example, the standard of proof for a criminal trial were a preponderance of the evidence rather than proof beyond a reasonable doubt, there would be a smaller risk of factual errors that result in freeing guilty persons, but a far greater risk of factual errors that result in convicting the innocent. Because the standard of proof affects the comparative frequency of these two types of erroneous outcomes, the choice of the standard to be applied in a particular kind of litigation should, in a rational world, reflect an assessment of the comparative social disutility of each.\n\n\n24\nWhen one makes such an assessment, the reason for different standards of proof in civil as opposed to criminal litigation becomes apparent. In a civil suit between two private parties for money damages, for example, we view it as no more serious in general for there to be an erroneous verdict in the defendant's favor than for there to be an erroneous verdict in the plaintiff's favor. A preponderance of the evidence standard therefore seems peculiarly appropriate for, as explained most sensibly,3 it simply requires the trier of fact 'to believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexistence before (he) may find in favor of the party who has the burden to persuade the (judge) of the fact's existence.'4\n\n\n25\nIn a criminal case, on the other hand, we do not view the social disutility of convincting an innocent man as equivalent to the disutility of acquitting someone who is guilty. As Mr. Justice Brennan wrote for the Court in Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 525\u2014526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 1341\u20141342, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958):\n\n\n26\n'There is always in litigation a margin of error,      representing error in factfinding, which both parties must      take into account. Where one party has at stake an interest      of transcending value\u2014as a criminal defendant his liberty      this margin of error is reduced as to him by the process of      placing on the other party the burden * * * of persuading the      fact-finder at the conclusion of the trial of his guilt      beyond a reasonable doubt.'\n\n\n27\nIn this context, I view the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal case as bottomed on a fundamental value determination of our society that it is far worse to convict an innocent man than to let a guilty man go free. It is only because of the nearly complete and long-standing acceptance of the reasonable-doubt standard by the States in criminal trials that the Court has not before today had to hold explicitly that due process, as an expression of fundamental procedural fairness,5 requires a more stringent standard for criminal trials than for ordinary civil litigation.\n\nII\n\n28\nWhen one assesses the consequences of an erroneous factual determination in a juvenile delinquency proceeding in which a youth is accused of a crime, I think it must be concluded that, while the consequences are not identical to those in a criminal case, the differences will not support a distinction in the standard of proof. First, and of paramount importance, a factual error here, as in a criminal case, exposes the accused to a complete loss of his personal liberty through a state-imposed confinement away from his home, family, and friends. And, second, a delinquency determination, to some extent at least, stigmatizes a youth in that it is by definition bottomed on a finding that the accused committed a crime.6 Although there are no doubt costs to society (and possibly even to the youth himself) in letting a guilty youth go free, I think here, as in a criminal case, it is far worse to declare an innocent youth a delinquent. I therefore agree that a juvenile court judge should be no less convinced of the factual conclusion that the accused committed the criminal act with which he is charged than would be required in a criminal trial.\n\nIII\n\n29\nI wish to emphasize, as I did in my separate opinion in Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 65, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1463, that there is no automatic congruence between the procedural requirements imposed by due process in a criminal case, and those imposed by due process in juvenile cases.7 It is of great importance, in my view, that procedural strictures not be constitutionally imposed that jeopardize 'the essential elements of the State's purpose' in creating juvenile courts, id., at 72, 87 S.Ct. at 1467. In this regard, I think it worth emphasizing that the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a juvenile committed a criminal act before he is found to be a delinquent does not (1) interfere with the worthy goal of rehabilitating the juvenile, (2) make any significant difference in the extent to which a youth is stigmatized as a 'criminal' because he has been found to be a delinquent, or (3) burden the juvenile courts with a procedural requirement that will make juvenile adjudications significantly more time consuming, or rigid. Today's decision simply requires a juvenile court judge to be more confident in his belief that the youth did the act with which he has been charged.\n\n\n30\nWith these observations, I join the Court's opinion, subject only to the constitutional reservations expressed in my opinion in Gault.\n\n\n31\nMr. Chief Justice BURGER, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART joins, dissenting.\n\n\n32\nThe Court's opinion today rests entirely on the assumption that all juvenile proceedings are 'criminal prosecutions,' hence subject to constitutional limitations. This derives from earlier holdings, which, like today's holding, were steps eroding the differences between juvenile courts and traditional criminal courts. The original concept of the juvenile court system was to provide a benevolent and less formal means than criminal courts could provide for dealing with the special and often sensitive problems of youthful offenders. Since I see no constitutional requirement of due process sufficient to overcome the legislative judgment of the States in this area, I dissent from further straitjacketing of an already overly restricted system. What the juvenile court system needs is not more but less of the trappings of legal procedure and judicial formalism; the juvenile court system requires breathing room and flexibility in order to survive, if it can survive the repeated assaults from this Court.\n\n\n33\nMuch of the judicial attitude manifested by the Court's opinion today and earlier holdings in this field is really a protest against inadequate juvenile court staffs and facilities; we 'burn down the stable to get rid of the mice.' The lack of support and the distressing growth of juvenile crime have combined to make for a literal breakdown in many if not most juvenile courts. Constitutional problems were not seen while those courts functioned in an atmosphere where juvenile judges were not crushed with an avalanche of cases.\n\n\n34\nMy hope is that today's decision will not spell the end of a generously conceived program of compassionate treatment intended to mitigate the rigors and trauma of exposing youthful offenders to a traditional criminal court; each step we take turns the clock back to the pre-juvenile-court era. I cannot regard it as a manifestation of progress to transform juvenile courts into criminal courts, which is what we are well on the way to accomplishing. We can only hope the legislative response will not reflect our own by having these courts abolished.\n\n\n35\nMr. Justice BLACK, dissenting.\n\n\n36\nThe majority states that 'many opinions of this Court indicate that it has long been assumed that proof of a criminal charge beyond a reasonable doubt is constitutionally required.' Ante, at 362. I have joined in some of those opinions, as well as the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Leland v. Oregon, 343 U.S. 790, 802, 72 S.Ct. 1002, 1009, 96 L.Ed. 1302 (1952). The Court has never clearly held, however, that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is either expressly or impliedly commanded by any provision of the Constitution. The Bill of Rights, which in my view is made fully applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, see Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46, 71\u201475, 67 S.Ct. 1672, 1686\u20141688, 91 L.Ed. 1903 (1947) (dissenting opinion), does by express language provide for, among other things, a right to counsel in criminal trials, a right to indictment, and the right of a defendant to be informed of the nature of the charges against him.1 And in two places the Constitution provides for trial by jury,2 but nowhere in that document is there any statement that conviction of crime requires proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Constitution thus goes into some detail to spell out what kind of trial a defendant charged with crime should have, and I believe the Court has no power to add to or subtract from the procedures set forth by the Founders. I realize that it is far easier to substitute individual judges' ideas of 'fairness' for the fairness prescribed by the Constitution, but I shall not at any time surrender my belief that that document itself should be our guide, not our own concept of what is fair, decent, and right. That this old 'shock-the-conscience' test is what the Court is relying on, rather than the words of the Constitution, is clearly enough revealed by the reference of the majority to 'fair treatment' and to the statement by the dissenting judges in the New York Court of Appeals that failure to require proof beyond a reasonable doubt amounts to a 'lack of fundamental fairness.' Ante, at 359, 363. As I have said time and time again, I prefer to put my faith in the words of the written Constitution itself rather than to rely on the shifting, day-to-day standards of fairness of individual judges.\n\n\n37\n* Our Constitution provides that no person shall be 'deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.'3 The four words\u2014due process of law\u2014have been the center of substantial legal debate over the years. See Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227, 235\u2014236, and n. 8, 60 S.Ct. 472, 476\u2014477, 84 L.Ed. 716 (1940). Some might think that the words themselves are vague. But any possible ambiguity disappears when the phrase is viewed in the light of history and the accepted meaning of those words prior to and at the time our Constitution was written.\n\n\n38\n'Due process of law' was originally used as a shorthand expression for governmental proceedings according to the 'law of the land' as it existed at the time of those proceedings. Both phrases are derived from the laws of England and have traditionally been regarded as meaning the same thing. The Magna Charta provided that:\n\n\n39\n'No Freeman shall be taken, or imprisoned, or be disseised of      his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed,      or exiled, or any otherwise destroyed; nor will we not pass upon him, nor condemn him,      but by lawful Judgment of his Peers, or by Law of the Land.'4\n\n\n40\nLater English statutes reinforced and confirmed these basic freedoms. In 1350 a statute declared that 'it is contained in the Great Charter of the Franchises of England that none shall be imprisoned nor put out of his Freehold, nor of his Franchises nor free Custom, unless it be by the Law of the Land * * *.'5 Four years later another statute provided '(t)hat no Man of what Estate or Condition that he be, shall be put out of Land or Tenement, nor taken nor imprisoned, nor disinherited, nor put to Death, without being brought in Answer by due Process of the Law.'6 And in 1363 it was provided 'that no man be taken or imprisoned, nor put out of his freehold, without process of law.'7\n\n\n41\nDrawing on these and other sources, Lord Coke, in 1642, concluded that 'due process of law' was synonymous with the phrase 'by law of the land.'8 One of the earliest cases in this Court to involve the interpretation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment declared that '(t)he words, 'due process of law,' were undoubtedly intended to convey the same meaning as the words 'by the law of the land' in Magna Charta.' Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improv. Co., 18 How. 272, 276, 15 L.Ed. 372 (1856).\n\n\n42\nWhile it is thus unmistakably clear that 'due process of law' means according to 'the law of the land,' this Court has not consistently defined what 'the law of the land' means and in my view members of this Court frequently continue to misconceive the correct interpretation of that phrase. In Murray's Lessee, supra, Mr. Justice Curtis, speaking for the Court, stated:\n\n\n43\n'The constitution contains no description of those processes      which it was intended to allow or forbid. It does not even      declare what principles are to be applied to ascertain      whether it be due process. It is manifest that it was not      left to the legislative power to enact any process which      might be devised. The article is a restraint on the      legislative as well as on the executive and judicial powers      of the government, and cannot be so construed as to leave      congress free to make any process 'due process of law,' by      its mere will. To what principles, then, are we to resort to      ascertain whether this process, enacted by congress, is due      process? To this the answer must be twofold. We must examine      the constitution itself, to see whether this process be in      conflict with any of its provisions. If not found to be so,      we must look to those settled usages and modes of proceeding      existing in the common and statute law of England, before the      emigration of our ancestors, and which are shown not to have      been unsuited to their civil and political condition by      having been acted on by them after the settlement of this      country.' Id., at 276\u2014277.9\n\n\n44\nLater in Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78, 29 S.Ct. 14, 53 L.Ed. 97 (1908), Mr. Justice Moody, again speaking for the Court, reaffirmed that 'due process of law' meant 'by law of the land,' but he went on to modify Mr. Justice Curtis' definition of the phrase. He stated:\n\n\n45\n'First. What is due process of law may be ascertained by an      examination of those settled usages and modes of proceedings      existing in the common and statute law of England before the      emigration of our ancestors, and shown not to have been      unsuited to their civil and political condition by having      been acted on by them after the settlement of this country. *      * *\n\n\n46\n'Second. It does not follow, however, that a procedure      settled in English law at the time of the emigration, and      brought to this country and practiced by our ancestors, is an      essential element of due process of law. If that were so the      procedure of the first half of the seventeenth century would      be fastened upon the American jurisprudence like a      straight-jacket, only to be unloosed by constitutional      amendment. * * *\n\n\n47\n'Third. But, consistently with the requirements of due      process, no change in ancient procedure can be made which      disregards those fundamental principles, to be ascertained      from time to time by judicial action, which have relation to      process of law and protect the citizen in his private right,      and guard him against the arbitrary action of government.'      Id., at 100\u2014101, 29 S.Ct., at 20.10\n\n\n48\nIn those words is found the kernel of the 'natural law due process' notion by which this Court frees itself from the limits of a written Constitution and sets itself loose to declare any law unconstitutional that 'shocks its conscience,' deprives a person of 'fundamental fairness,' or violates the principles 'implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.' See Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 172, 72 S.Ct. 205, 209, 210, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952); Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325, 58 S.Ct. 149, 152, 82 L.Ed. 288 (1937). While this approach has been frequently used in deciding so-called 'procedural' questions, it has evolved into a device as easily invoked to declare invalid 'substantive' laws that sufficiently shock the consciences of at least five members of this Court. See, e.g., Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 25 S.Ct. 539, 49 L.Ed. 937 (1905); Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U.S. 1, 35 S.Ct. 240, 59 L.Ed. 441 (1915); Burns Baking Co. v. Bryan, 264 U.S. 504, 44 S.Ct. 412, 68 L.Ed. 813 (1924); Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965). I have set forth at length in prior opinions my own views that this concept is completely at odds with the basic principle that our Government is one of limited powers and that such an arrogation of unlimited authority by the judiciary cannot be supported by the language or the history of any provision of the Constitution. See, e.g., Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46, 68, 67 S.Ct. 1672, 1684, 91 L.Ed. 1903 (1947) (dissenting opinion); Griswold v. Connecticut, supra, 381 U.S., at 507, 85 S.Ct., at 1694, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965) (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n49\nIn my view both Mr. Justice Curtis and Mr. Justice Moody gave 'due process of law' an unjustifiably broad interpretation. For me the only correct meaning of that phrase is that our Government must proceed according to the 'law of the land'\u2014that is, according to written constitutional and statutory provisions as interpreted by court decisions. The Due Process Clause, in both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, in and of itself does not add to those provisions, but in effect states that our governments are governments of law and constitutionally bound to act only according to law.11 To some that view may seem a degrading and niggardly view of what is undoubtedly a fundamental part of our basic freedoms. But that criticism fails to note the historical importance of our Constitution and the virtual revolution in the history of the government of nations that was achieved by forming a government that from the beginning had its limits of power set forth in one written document that also made it abundantly clear that all governmental actions affecting life, liberty, and property were to be according to law.\n\n\n50\nFor years our ancestors had struggled in an attempt to bring England under one written constitution, consolidating in one place all the threads of the fundamental law of that nation. They almost succeeded in that attempt,12 but it was not until after the American Revolution that men were able to achieve that longsought goal. But the struggle had not been simply to put all the constitutional law in one document, it was also to make certain that men would be governed by law, not the arbitrary fiat of the man or men in power. Our ancestors' ancestors had known the tyranny of the kings and the rule of man and it was, in my view, in order to insure against such actions that the Founders wrote into our own Magna Carta the fundamental principle of the rule of law, as expressed in the historically meaningful phrase 'due process of law.' The many decisions of this Court that have found in that phrase a blanket authority to govern the country according to the views of at least five members of this institution have ignored the essential meaning of the very words they invoke. When this Court assumes for itself the power to declare any law\u2014state or federal\u2014unconstitutional because it offends the majority's own views of what is fundamental and decent in our society, our Nation ceases to be governed according to the 'law of the land' and instead becomes one governed ultimately by the 'law of the judges.'\n\n\n51\nIt can be, and has been, argued that when this Court strikes down a legislative act because it offends the idea of 'fundamental fairness' it furthers the basic thrust of our Bill of Rights by protecting individual freedom. But that argument ignores the effect of such decisions on perhaps the most fundamental individual liberty of our people\u2014the right of each man to participate in the self-government of his society. Our Federal Government was set up as one of limited powers, but it was also given broad power to do all that was 'necessary and proper' to carry out its basic purpose of governing the Nation, so long as those powers were not exercised contrary to the limitations set forth in the Constitution. And the States, to the extent they are not restrained by the provisions in that document, were to be left free to govern themselves in accordance with their own views of fairness and decency. Any legislature presumably passes a law because it thinks the end result will help more than hinder and will thus further the liberty of the society as a whole. The people, through their elected representatives, may of course be wrong in making those determinations, but the right of self-government that our Constitution preserves is just as important as any of the specific individual freedoms preserved in the Bill of Rights. The liberty of government by the people in my opinion, should never be denied by this Court except when the decision of the people as stated in laws passed by their chosen representatives, conflicts with the express or necessarily implied commands of our Constitution.\n\nII\n\n52\nI admit a strong, persuasive argument can be made for a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases\u2014and the majority has made that argument well\u2014but it is not for me as a judge to say for that reason that Congress or the States are without constitutional power to establish another standard that the Constitution does not otherwise forbid. It is quite true that proof beyond a reasonable doubt has long been required in federal criminal trials. It is also true that this requirement is almost universally found in the governing laws of the States. And as long as a particular jurisdiction requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, then the Due Process Clause commands that every trial in that jurisdiction must adhere to that standard. See Turner v. United States, 396 U.S. 398, 430, 90 S.Ct. 642, 24 L.Ed.2d 610 (1970) (Black, J., dissenting). But when, as here, a State through its duly constituted legislative branch decides to apply a different standard, then that standard, unless it is otherwise unconstitutional, must be applied to insure that persons are treated according to the 'law of the land.' The State of New York has made such a decision, and in my view nothing in the Due Process Clause invalidates it.\n\n\n\n1\n Thus, we do not see how it can be said in dissent that this opinion 'rests entirely on the assumption that all juvenile proceedings are 'criminal prosecutions,' hence subject to constitutional limitations.' As in Gault, 'we are not here concerned with * * * the pre-judicial stages of the juvenile process, nor do we direct our attention to the post-adjudicative or dispositional process.' 387 U.S., at 13, 87 S.Ct., at 1436. In New York, the adjudicatory stage of a delinquency proceeding is clearly distinct from both the preliminary phase of the juvenile process and from its dispositional stage. See N.Y. Family Court Act \u00a7\u00a7 731\u2014749. Similarly, we intimate no view concerning the constitutionality of the New York procedures governing children 'in need of supervision.' See id., at \u00a7\u00a7 711, 712, 742\u2014745. Nor do we consider whether there are other 'essentials of due process and fair treatment' required during the adjudicatory hearing of a delinquency proceeding. Finally, we have no occasion to consider appellant's argument that \u00a7 744(b) is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, as well as a denial of due process.\n\n\n2\n The ruling appears in the following portion of the hearing transcript:\nCounsel: 'Your Honor is making a finding by the preponderance of the evidence.'\nCourt: 'Well, it convinces me.'\nCounsel: 'It's not beyond a reasonable doubt, Your Honor.'\nCourt: 'That is true * * * Our statute says a preponderance and a preponderance it is.'\n\n\n3\n Accord, e.g., In re Dennis M., 70 Cal.2d 444, 75 Cal.Rptr. 1, 450 P.2d 296 (1969); In re Ellis, 253 A.2d 789 (D.C.Ct.App. 1969); State v. Arenas, 253 Or. 215, 453 P.2d 915 (Or.1969); State v. Santana, 444 S.W.2d 614 (Texas 1969). Contra. United States v. Costanzo, 395 F.2d 441 (C.A.4th Cir. 1968); In re Urbasek, 38 Ill.2d 535, 232 N.E.2d 716 (1967); Jones v. Commonwealth, 185 Va. 335, 38 S.E.2d 444 (1946); N.D.Cent.Code \u00a7 27\u201420\u201429(2) (Supp. 1969); Colo.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 22\u20143\u20146(1) (1967); Md.Ann.Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 70\u201418(a) (Supp. 1969); N.J.Ct.Rule 6:9(1)(f) (1967); Wash.Sup.Ct., Juv.Ct.Rule \u00a7 4.4(b) (1969); cf. In re Agler, 19 Ohio St.2d 70, 249 N.E.2d 808 (1969).\nLegislative adoption of the reasonabledoubt standard has been urged by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and by the Children's Bureau of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's Social and Rehabilitation Service. See Uniform Juvenile Court Act \u00a7 29(b) (1968); Children's Bureau, Social and Rehabilitation Service, U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Legislative Guide for Drafting Family and Juvenile Court Acts \u00a7 32(c) (1969). Cf. the proposal of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency that a 'clear and convincing' standard be adopted. Model Rules for Juvenile Courts, Rule 26, p. 57 (1969). See generally Cohen, The Standard of Proof in Juvenile Proceedings: Gault Beyond a Reasonable Doubt, 68 Mich.L.Rev. 567 (1970).\n\n\n4\n Appellee, New York City, apparently concedes as much in its Brief, page 8, where it states:\n'A determination that the New York law unconstitutionally denies due process because it does not provide for use of the reasonable doubt standard probably would not have a serious impact if all that resulted would be a change in the quantum of proof.'\nAnd Dorsen & Rezneck, supra, at 27, have observed:\n'(T)he reasonable doubt test is superior to all others in protecting against an unjust adjudication of guilt, and that is as much a concern of the juvenile court as of the criminal court. It is difficult to see how the distinctive objectives of the juvenile court give rise to a legitimate institutional interest in finding a juvenile to have committed a violation of the criminal law on less evidence than if he were an adult.'\n\n\n5\n The more comprehensive and effective the procedures used to prevent public disclosure of the finding, the less the danger of stigma. As we indicated in Gault, however, often the 'claim of secrecy * * * is more rhetoric than reality.' 387 U.S., at 24, 87 S.Ct., at 1442.\n\n\n6\n Compare this Court's rejection of the preponderance standard in deportation proceedings, where we ruled that the Government must support its allegations with 'clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence.' Woodby v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 385 U.S., 276, 285, 87 S.Ct. 483, 488, 17 L.Ed.2d 362 (1966). Although we ruled in Woodby that deportation is not tantamount to a criminal conviction, we found that since it could lead to 'drastic deprivations,' it is impermissible for a person to be 'banished from this country upon no higher degree of proof than applies in a negligence case.' Ibid.\n\n\n1\n See also Paulsen, Juvenile Courts and the Legacy of '67, 43 Ind.L.J. 527, 551\u2014552 (1968).\n\n\n2\n For an interesting analysis of standards of proof see Kaplan, Decision Theory and the Factfinding Process, 20 Stan.L.Rev. 1065, 1071\u20141077 (1968).\n\n\n3\n The preponderance test has been criticized, justifiably in my view, when it is read as asking the trier of fact to weigh in some objective sense the quantity of evidence submitted by each side rather than asking him to decide what he believes most probably happened. See J. Maguire, Evidence, Common Sense and Common Law 180 (1947).\n\n\n4\n F. James, Civil Procedure 250\u2014251 (1965); see E. Morgan, Some Problems of Proof Under the Anglo-American System of Litigation 84\u201485 (1956).\n\n\n5\n In dissent my Brother BLACK again argues that, apart from the specific prohibitions of the first eight amendments, any procedure spelled out by a legislature\u2014no matter how unfair\u2014passes constitutional muster under the Due Process Clause. He bottoms his conclusion on history that he claims demonstrates (1) that due process means 'law of the land'; (2) that any legislative enactment, ipso facto, is part of the law of the land; and (3) that the Fourteenth\nAmendment incorporates the prohibitions of the Bill of Rights and applies them to the States. I cannot refrain from expressing my continued bafflement at my Brother BLACK'S insistence that due process, whether under the Fourteenth Amendment or the Fifth Amendment, does not embody a concept of fundamental fairness as part of our scheme of constitutionally ordered liberty. His thesis flies in the face of a course of judicial history reflected in an unbroken line of opinions that have interpreted due process to impose restraints on the procedures government may adopt in its dealing with its citizens, see, e.g., the cases cited in my dissenting opinions in Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 522, 539\u2014545, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 1765, 1774\u20141778, 6 L.Ed.2d 989 (1961); Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 171, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 1458, 1459, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968); as well as the uncontroverted scholarly research (notwithstanding H. Flack, The Adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment (1908)), respecting the intendment of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, see Fairman, Does the Fourteenth Amendment Incorporate the Bill of Rights? The Original Understanding, 2 Stan.L.Rev. 5 (1949). Indeed, with all respect, the very case cited in Brother BLACK'S dissent as establishing that 'due process of law' means 'law of the land' rejected the argument that any statute, by the mere process of enactment, met the requirements of the Due Process Clause. In Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improv. Co., 18 How, 272, 15 L.Ed. 372 (1856), an issue was whether a 'distress warrant' issued by the Solicitor of the Treasury under an act of Congress to collect money due for taxes offended the Due Process Clause. Justice Curtis wrote: 'That the warrant now in question is legal process, is not denied. It was issued in conformity with an Act of Congress. But is it 'due process of law?' The constitution contains no description of those processes which it was intended to allow or forbid. It does not even declare what principles are to be applied to ascertain whether it be due process. It is manifest that it was not left to the legislative power to enact any process which might be devised. The article is a restraint on the legislative as well as on the executive and judicial powers of the government, and cannot be so construed as to leave congress free to make any process 'due process of law,' by its mere will.' Id., at 276. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n6\n The New York statute was amended to distinguish between a 'juvenile delinquent,' i.e., a youth 'who does any act which, if done by an adult, would constitute a crime,' N.Y.Family Court Act \u00a7 712 (1963), and a '(p)erson in need of supervision' (PINS) who is a person 'who is an habitual truant or who is incorrigible, ungovernable or habitually disobedient and beyond the lawful control of parent or other lawful authority.' The PINS category was established in order to avoid the stigma of finding someone to be a 'juvenile delinquent' unless he committed a criminal act. The Legislative Committee report stated: \"Juvenile delinquent' is now a term of disapproval. The judges of the Children's Court and the Domestic Relations Court of course are aware of this and also aware that government officials and private employers often learn of an adjudication of delinquency.' N.Y.Jt. Legislative Committee on Court Reorganization, The Family Court Act, pt. 2, p. 7 (1962). Moreover, the powers of the police and courts differ in these two categories of cases. See id., at 7\u20149. Thus, in a PINS type case, the consequences of an erroneous factual determination are by no means identical to those involved here.\n\n\n7\n In Gault, for example, I agreed with the majority that due process required (1) adequate notice of the 'nature and terms' of the proceedings; (2) notice of the right to retain counsel, and an obligation on the State to provide counsel for indigents 'in cases in which the child may be confined'; and (3) a written record 'adequate to permit effective review.' 387 U.S., at 72, 87 S.Ct., at 1467. Unlike the majority, however, I thought it unnecessary at the time of Gault to impose the additional requirements of the privilege against self-incrimination, confrontation, and cross-examination.\n\n\n1\n Amdts. V, VI, U.S. Constitution.\n\n\n2\n Art. III, \u00a7 2, cl. 3; Amdt. VI, U.S. Constitution.\n\n\n3\n The Fifth Amendment applies this limitation to the Federal Government and the Fourteenth Amendment imposes the same restriction on the States.\n\n\n4\n 9 Hen. 3, c. 29 (1225). A similar provision appeared in c. 39 of the original issue signed by King John in 1215.\n\n\n5\n 25 Edw. 3, Stat. 5, c. IV.\n\n\n6\n 28 Edw. 3, c. III.\n\n\n7\n 37 Edw. 3, c. XVIII.\n\n\n8\n Coke's Institutes, Second Part, 50 (1st ed. 1642).\n\n\n9\n Cf. United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 3 L.Ed. 259 (1812), in which the Court held that there was no jurisdiction in federal courts to try criminal charges based on the common law and that all federal crimes must be based on a statute of Congress.\n\n\n10\n Cf. the views of Mr. Justice Iredell in Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 398, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798).\n\n\n11\n It is not the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, standing alone, that requires my conclusion that that Amendment was intended to apply fully the protection of the Bill of Rights to actions by the States. That conclusion follows from the language\nof the entire first section of the Fourteenth Amendment, as illuminated by the legislative history surrounding its adoption. See Adamson v. California, supra, 32 U.S., at 71\u201475, 92\u2014123, 67 S.Ct., at 1686\u20141688, 1696\u20141711.\nMr. Justice Harlan continues to insist that uncontroverted scholarly research shows that the Fourteenth Amendment did not incorporate the Bill of Rights as limitations on the States. See Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 540, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 1775, 6 L.Ed.2d 989 (1961) (dissenting opinion); Griswold v. Connecticut, supra, 381 U.S., at 500, 85 S.Ct., at 1690 (concurring in judgment); ante, at 372-373, n. 5. I cannot understand that conclusion. Mr. Fairman, in the article repeatedly cited by Mr. Justice Harlan, surveys the legislative history and concludes that it is his opinion that the amendment did not incorporate the Bill of Rights. Mr. Flack, in at least an equally 'scholarly' writing, surveys substantially the same documents relied upon by Mr. Fairman and concludes that a prime objective of Congress in proposing the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment was '(t)o make the Bill of Rights (the first eight Amendments) binding upon, or applicable to, the States.' Compare H. Flack, The Adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment 95 (1908), with Fairman, Does the Fourteenth Amendment Incorporate the Bill of Rights? The Original Understanding, 2 Stan.L.Rev. 5 (1949). It is, of course, significant that since the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment this Court has held almost all the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the States: the First Amendment, e.g., Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652, 45 S.Ct. 625, 69 L.Ed. 1138 (1925), Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940), Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229, 83 S.Ct. 680, 9 L.Ed.2d 697 (1963); the Fourth Amendment, Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961); the Fifth Amendment, Chicago B. & Q.R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U.S. 226, 17 S.Ct. 581, 41 L.Ed. 979 (1897), Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964), Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969); the Sixth Amendment Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965), Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U.S. 213, 87 S.Ct. 988, 18 L.Ed.2d 1 (1967), Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968); and the Eighth Amendment, Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962). To me this history indicates that in the end Mr. Flack's thesis has fared much better than Mr. Fairman's 'uncontroverted' scholarship.\n\n\n12\n See J. Frank, The Levellers (1955).\n\n\n","label":1}

Davis, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nMr. Justice BURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nIn this proceeding we are limited to the consideration of the following questions: (1) is it barred by the statute of limitations and, if not, (2) is it barred by the principles of res judicata, or estoppel, or the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment? For the reasons hereafter stated we hold that it is barred by the statute of limitations. We do not reach or discuss the second question.\n\n\n2\nThe issues raised by the first question are:\n\n\n3\n1. Whether the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act1 has suspended the running of the general three-year statute of limitations2 in relation to the offenses charged in\u2014\n\n\n4\nCount I, under the general conspiracy statute;3\n\n\n5\nCount II, under \u00a7 346(a)(1) of the Nationality Act of 1940;4 or\n\n\n6\nCount III, under \u00a7 346(a)(5) of the Nationality Act of 1940;5 and\n\n\n7\n2. Whether the saving clause in \u00a7 21 of the Act of June 25, 1948, which enacted the present Criminal Code into law,6 continued in effect the special five-year statute of limitations of \u00a7 346(g) of the Nationality Act of 19407 in relation to violations of \u00a7 346(a) of that Act.\n\n\n8\nFor the reasons set forth, we reach a negative conclusion on each of the above issues.\n\n\n9\nPetitioner Harry Bridges entered the United States in 1920 as an immigrant seaman from Austalia. Subsequently, he defeated two attempts of the United States to deport him because of his alleged Communist Party membership or affiliation. The second such attempt culminated June 18, 1945, in Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135, 65 S.Ct. 1443, 89 L.Ed. 2103.\n\n\n10\nJune 23, 1945, he applied, in the San Francisco office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, for a Certificate of Arrival and a Preliminary Form for Petition for Naturalization. August 8, he appeared, with petitioners Schmidt and Robertson, before an examiner for a preliminary examination. Each of the three testified that Bridges was not a member of the Communist Party.\n\n\n11\nSeptember 17, 1945, Bridges appeared in the Superior Court in San Francisco for the naturalization hearing. Schmidt and Robertson testified that they had known Bridges for five years or longer, that he was a resident of the United States during that time and that they vouched for his loyalty to the United States. Bridges gave the following answers under oath:\n\n\n12\n'Q. Do you now, or have you ever, belonged to any      organization that advocated the overthrow of the government      by force or violence? A. No.\n\n\n13\n'Q. Do you now, or have you ever, belonged to the Communist      Party in the United States? A. I have not, I do not.'\n\n\n14\nHe was then admitted to citizenship.\n\n\n15\nMay 25, 1949, more than three years later, a grand jury in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California returned the present indictment in three counts.\n\n\n16\nCount I charges the three petitioners with a conspiracy to defraud the United States by impairing, obstructing and defeating the proper administration of its naturalization laws by having Bridges fraudulently petition for and obtain naturalization by falsely and fraudulently stating to the naturalization court that he had never belonged to the Communist Party in the United States, and that such statement was known at all times by each of the petitioners to be false and fraudulent. The appearance and testimony of the petitioners in the naturalization proceeding were alleged as the overt acts in the conspiracy.\n\n\n17\nThat count is laid under the following general conspiracy statute:\n\n\n18\n'If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense      against the United States, or to defraud the United States in      any manner or for any purpose, and one or more of such      parties do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy,      each of the parties to such conspiracy shall be fined not      more than ten thousand dollars, or imprisoned not more than      two years, or both.' \u00a7 37 of the old Criminal Code, 35 Stat.      1096, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 88, now 18 U.S.C. (Supp. V) \u00a7 371, 18      U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371.\n\n\n19\nCount II charges Bridges with wilfully and knowingly making a false statement under oath in the naturalization proceeding when he testified that he was not and had not been a member of the Communist Party. Count II is laid under \u00a7 346(a)(1) of the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1163, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 746(a)(1), which makes it a felony for any person\u2014\n\n\n20\n'Knowingly to make a false statement under oath, either      orally or in writing, in any case, proceeding, or matter      relating to, or under, or by virtue of any law of the United      States relating to naturalization or citizenship.'8\n\n\n21\nCount III charges Schmidt and Robertson with wilfully and knowingly aiding Bridges, who was not entitled thereto, to obtain a Certificate of Naturalization which was to be procured by false and fraudulent statements. It avers that they knew that Bridges was a member of the Communist Party and that he had made false and fraudulent representations in the naturalization proceeding. Count III is laid under \u00a7 346(a)(5) of the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1164, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 746(a)(5), which makes it a felony\u2014\n\n\n22\n'To encourage, aid, advise, or assist any person not entitled      thereto to obtain, accept, or receive any certificate of      arrival, declaration of intention, certificate of      naturalization, or certificate of citizenship, or other      documentary evidence of naturalization or of citizenship\u2014\n\n\n23\n'a. Knowing the same to have been procured by fraud; * * *.'9\n\n\n24\nPetitioners each moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground, inter alia, that each count was barred by the statute of limitations. The motions were denied. D.C., 86 F.Supp. 922. The trial resulted in a jury verdict of guilty on each count. Bridges received concurrent sentences of imprisonment for two years on Count I and five years on Count II. The other petitioners each received concurrent sentences of imprisonment for two years on each of Counts I and III. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 9 Cir., 199 F.2d 811. Rehearing en banc was denied. 9 Cir., 201 F.2d 254. Because of an indicated conflict between that decision and part of the decision in Marzani v. United States, 83 U.S.App.D.C. 78, 168 F.2d 133, affirmed by an equally divided Court, 335 U.S. 895, 69 S.Ct. 299, 93 L.Ed. 431, 336 U.S. 922, 69 S.Ct. 513, 93 L.Ed. 1075, as well as its conflict in part with United States v. Obermeier, 2 Cir., 186 F.2d 243, and because of the importance of the issues, we granted certiorari, 345 U.S. 904, 73 S.Ct. 648.10\n\n\n25\nThe acts charged occurred in 1945. Accordingly, unless the general three-year statute of limitations is suspended or superseded, the indictment, found in 1949, was out of time and must be dismissed.11\n\n\n26\nA. The suspension prescribed by the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act applies to offenses involving the defrauding of the United States or any agency thereof, whether by conspiracy or not, and in any manner, but only where the fraud is of a pecuniary nature or at least of a nature concerning property.\n\n\n27\nThe Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act creates an exception to a longstanding congressional 'policy of repose' that is fundamental to our society and our criminal law. From 1790 to 1876, the general limitation applicable to noncapital offenses was two years and since then it has been three years.12 In relation to a comparable exception stated in \u00a7 1110(a) as the limitation applicable under the Revenue Act of 1926,13 Mr. Justice Roberts, speaking for the Court, said:\n\n\n28\n'Moreover, the concluding clause of the section, though      denominated a proviso, is an excepting clause, and therefore      to be narrowly construed. United States v. McElvain, 272 U.S.      633, 639, 47 S.Ct. 219, 71 L.Ed. 451.14 And, as the section      has to do with statutory crimes, it is to be liberally      interpreted in favor of repose, and ought not to be extended      by construction to embrace so-called frauds not so      denominated by the statutes creating offenses.' United States      v. Scharton, 285 U.S. 518, 521\u2014522, 52 S.Ct. 416, 417, 76      L.Ed. 917.\n\n\n29\nThe legislative history of this exception emphasizes the propriety of its conservative interpretation. It indicates a purpose to suspend the general statute of limitations only as to war frauds of a pecuniary nature or of a nature concerning property. It nowhere suggests a purpose to swallow up the three-year limitation to the extent necessary to reach the offenses before us.\n\n\n30\nThe present Suspension Act had its origin in the Act of August 24, 1942.15 See United States v. Smith, 342 U.S. 225, 226 227, 72 S.Ct. 260, 261, 96 L.Ed. 252. That Act was a wartime measure reviving for World War II substantially the same exception to the general statute of limitations which, from 1921 to 1927, had been directed at the war frauds of World War I.16 The Committee Reports show that in 1921 Congress aimed the proviso at the pecuniary frauds growing out of war contracts.17 Congress was concerned with the exceptional opportunities to defraud the United States that were inherent in its gigantic and hastily organized procurement program. It sought to help safeguard the treasury from such frauds by increasing the time allowed for their discovery and prosecution. In 1942, the reports and proceedings demonstrate a like purpose, coupled with a design to readopt the World War I policy.18\n\n\n31\nThis interpretation of the scope of the 1942 provision was expressly approved in Marzani v. United States, 83 U.S.App.D.C. 78 82, 168 F.2d 133\u2014137. As to nine counts based upon the amended False Claims Act, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 287, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the 1942 Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act did not suspend the three-year statute of limitations. Those counts charged that false statements had been made to government agencies in relation to Communist Party membership, in connection with an application for a position in the government service. Referring to United States v. Gilliland, 312 U.S. 86, 61 S.Ct. 518, 85 L.Ed. 598, the Court of Appeals said:\n\n\n32\n'Thus, the (Supreme) Court held that defrauding the United      States in a pecuniary or financial sense is not a constituent      ingredient of offenses under the False Claims Act.\n\n\n33\n'It necessarily follows, in our view, that the Suspension Act      does not apply to offenses under the False Claims Act. The      Supreme Court has clearly said (1) that a statute identical      in pertinent part with the Suspension Act does not apply to      offenses of which defrauding the United States in a pecuniary      way is not an essential ingredient; and (2) that such      defrauding of the United States is not an essential      ingredient of offenses under the False Claims statute.' 83      U.S.App.D.C., at page 81, 168 F.2d, at page 136.\n\n\n34\nBrought here on several issues, including dismissal of the nine counts, that case was twice affirmed, without opinion, by an evenly divided Court. 335 U.S. 895, 69 S.Ct. 299, 93 L.Ed. 431, 336 U.S. 922, 69 S.Ct. 513, 93 L.Ed. 1075. See also, United States v. Cohn, 270 U.S. 339, 46 S.Ct. 251, 70 L.Ed. 616.19\n\n\n35\nAs the offenses here charged are those of knowingly making a false statement under oath in a proceeding relating to naturalization (Count II), or of conspiring to have someone do so (Count I), or of aiding someone to obtain a Certificate of Naturalization knowing it to be procured by fraud (Count III), none of them involve the defrauding of the United States in any pecuniary manner or in a manner concerning property. We accordingly hold that, for that reason, the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act does not apply to those offenses.\n\n\n36\nB. A further ground for our conclusion is that this Court already has interpreted the language before us, or similar language in comparable Acts, to mean that the wartime suspension of limitations authorized by Congress is limited strictly to offenses in which defrauding or attempting to defraud the United States is an essential ingredient of the offense charged. Decisions of this Court, made prior to 1942, had so interpreted the earlier legislation that its substantial reenactment, in 1942, carried with it the interpretation above stated. United States v. Scharton, 285 U.S. 518, 52 S.Ct. 416, 76 L.Ed. 917; United States v. McElvain, 272 U.S. 633, 47 S.Ct. 219, 71 L.Ed. 451; United States v. Noveck, 271 U.S. 201, 46 S.Ct. 476, 70 L.Ed. 904. See also, Braverman v. United States, 317 U.S. 49, 54\u201455, 63 S.Ct. 99, 102, 87 L.Ed. 23, and United States v. Cohn, 270 U.S. 339, 46 S.Ct. 251, 70 L.Ed. 616.\n\n\n37\nThe simplest demonstration of this point appears in Count II. The offense there charged is that Bridges knowingly made a false material statement in a naturalization proceeding. In that offense, as in the comparable offense of perjury, fraud is not an essential ingredient. The offense is complete without proof of fraud, although fraud often accompanies it. The above-cited cases show that even though the offense may be committed in a pecuniary transaction involving a financial loss to the Government, that fact, alone, is not enough to suspend the running of the three-year statute of limitations. Under the doctrine of these cases, the suspension does not apply to the offense charged unless, under the statute creating the offense, fraud is an essential ingredient of it. The purpose of the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act is not that of generally suspending the three-year statute, e.g., in cases of perjury, larceny and like crimes. It seeks to suspend the running of it only where fraud against the Government is an essential ingredient of the crime. In view of the opportunity to commit such frauds in time of war, and in view of the difficulty of their prompt discovery and prosecution, the Government seeks extra time to deal with them. Nothing in \u00a7 346(a)(1) makes fraud an essential ingredient of the offense of making a false material statement under oath in a naturalization proceeding.\n\n\n38\nLikewise, in Count III, the aiding of someone to commit that offense, in violation of \u00a7 346(a)(5), does not require proof of fraud as an essential ingredient. If, as here, the main offense is complete with the proof of perjury, the suspension does not apply to the charge of aiding in the commission of that offense. The insertion in the indictment of the words 'procured by fraud' does not change the offense charged. The embellishment of the indictment does not lengthen the time for prosecution. It is the statutory definition of the offense that determines whether or not the statute of limitations comes within the Suspension Act.\n\n\n39\nSo it is with Count I. A charge of conspiracy to commit a certain substantive offense is not entitled to a longer statute of limitation than the charge of committing the offense itself. There is no additional time prescribed for indictments for conspiracies as such. The insertion of surplus words in the indictment does not change the nature of the offense charged.\n\n\n40\n'The language of the proviso cannot reasonably be read to      include all conspiracies defined by section 37. (The general      conspiracy section of the old Criminal Code, now 18 U.S.C.      (Supp. V) \u00a7 371, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371.) But if the proviso could      be construed to include any conspiracies, obviously it would      be limited to those to commit the substantive offenses which      it covers.' United States v. McElvain, 272 U.S. 633, 639, 47      S.Ct. 219, 220, 71 L.Ed. 451.\n\n\n41\nThe Government contends that the General Conspiracy Act20 under which Count I is laid comprises two classes of conspiracies: (1) 'to commit any offense against the United States' and (2) 'to defraud the United States in any manner or for any purpose'. It urges that the indictment here charges a conspiracy to defraud the United States under the second clause. It suggests that, under that clause, proof of a specific intent to defraud is an essential ingredient of the offense and thus brings Count I within the Suspension Act. The fallacy in that argument is that, while the indictment may be framed in the language of the second clause, both it and the proof to support it rely solely on the fact of a conspiracy to commit the substantive offenses violating \u00a7 346(a)(1) or s 346(a)(5) as charged in Counts II and III. Count I actually charges that petitioner conspired to 'defraud the United States' only by causing the commission of the identical offenses charged in Counts II and III. The use in Count I of language copied from the second clause of the conspiracy statute merely cloaks a factual charge of conspiring to cause, or knowingly to aid, Bridges to make a false statement under oath in his naturalization proceeding, or to obtain by false statements a Certificate of Naturalization to which he was not entitled.\n\n\n42\nThe Court of Appeals in Marzani v. United States, supra, was convinced that the Suspension Act did not apply to such offenses, as those here involved, under the False Claims Act, no matter what words descriptive of fraud were added to the indictment, so long as fraud was not an essential ingredient of the offense defined in the statute. Another Court of Appeals arrived at a like conclusion in United States v. Obermeier, 2 Cir., 186 F.2d 243, 256\u2014257, with respect to offenses under the statute involved in Count II of the instant indictment.\n\n\n43\nII. The saving clause in \u00a7 21 of the Act of June 25, 1948, does not 'save' the special five-year statute of limitations of the National Act of 1940 so as to apply it to the violations of that Act charged in Counts II and III.\n\n\n44\nThe Government contends, alternatively, that the indictment, which was found May 25, 1949, was timely as to Counts II and III, even if the Suspension Act is not applicable to this indictment. Its alternative contention is that those counts respectively charge violations of \u00a7 346(a)(1) and (5) of the Nationality Act of 1940 which occurred in 1945 and that the indictment for them was found within the special five-year limitation of \u00a7 346(g) of that Act.21 It appears, however, that \u00a7 346(a\u2014h) was expressly repealed, as of September 1, 1948, by \u00a7 21 of the Act of June 25, 1948, which enacted the new Criminal Code into law. Including its controversial saving clause, that repealing section reads as follows:\n\n\n45\n'Sec. 21. The sections or parts thereof of the Revised      Statutes or Statutes at Large enumerated in the following      schedule are hereby repealed.22 Any rights or liabilities now      existing under such sections or parts thereof shall not be      affected by this repeal.' 62 Stat. 862.\n\n\n46\nBy such repeal of \u00a7 346(g), the general three-year statute of limitations became applicable. 18 U.S.C. (Supp. V) \u00a7 3282, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3282.23 Three years having expired before the indictment was found, \u00a7 3282 bars the instant indictment. The Government, however, contends that the abovequoted saving clause in \u00a7 21 refers not only to substantive liabilities but also to the period during which a crime may be prosecuted and thus includes the special five-year limitation contained in \u00a7 346(g). This issue was presented to the Court of Appeals in the instant case and was decided against the Government. 9 Cir., 199 F.2d 811, 819\u2014820. In doing so, the court relied in part upon a like conclusion of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in United States v. Obermeier, supra. That case related to an indictment in two counts for knowingly making, in 1945, in a naturalization proceeding, as here, false statements under oath in relation to membership in the Communist Party. The review of legislative materials and court decisions made there need not be repeated here in reaching the same result\u2014that the saving clause in \u00a7 21 did not keep the special five-year limitation alive after September 1, 1948.24\n\n\n47\nThe purpose of Congress to substitute the general three-year limitation in place of the special five-year limitation is indicated in the Reviser's Note to 18 U.S.C. (Supp. V) \u00a7 3282, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3282 which says:\n\n\n48\n'In the consolidation of these sections the 5-year period of      limitation for violations of the Nationality Code, provided      for in said section 746(g) of Title 8, U.S.C., 1940 ed.,      Aliens and Nationality, is reduced to 3 years. There seemed      no sound basis for considering 3 years adequate in the case      of heinous felonies and gross frauds against the United      States but inadequate for misuse of a passport or false      statement to a naturalization examiner.'\n\n\n49\nTo adopt the interpretation proposed by the Government would produce the situation that offenses committed in August, 1948, would be indictable until August, 1953, where as like offenses committed in the following October, 1948, would not be indictable after October, 1951. The longer period for the prosecution of the earlier offenses has no relation to war conditions. Such a result is not to be inferred without a clear direction to that effect.\n\n\n50\nFinally, to interpret the words 'rights or liabilities' in the saving clause as including such procedural incidents as the period within which indictments may be found would overlook the practice of Congress to specify the saving of such limitations expressly when and if Congress wished them to be 'saved.' In the Revised Statutes of 1874, \u00a7 5598 preserved 'All offenses committed, and all penalties and forfeitures' but, nevertheless, \u00a7 5599 was inserted to add 'All acts of limitation, whether applicable to civil causes and proceedings, or to the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties or forfeitures * * *.'25 The 1909 Criminal Code contained similar provisions in \u00a7\u00a7 343 and 344. 35 Stat. 1159. In 1933, when the Revised Statutes were reexamined and obsolete sections, including \u00a7 5598, were repealed, \u00a7 5599 was retained. 47 Stat. 1431. The reason then given for its retention was that the survival clause in the general repealing statute, 47 Stat. 1431, referred 'only to 'rights' and 'liabilities' and not to remedies, recourse to which may be barred by limitation.' S.Rep. No. 1205, 72d Cong., 2d Sess. 3. See Campbell v. Holt, 115 U.S. 620, 6 S.Ct. 209, 29 L.Ed. 483.\n\n\n51\nAs the general three-year statute of limitations is applicable to each of the offenses charged and has been neither suspended by the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act, nor made inapplicable by \u00a7 21 of the Act of June 25, 1948, the indictment in this proceeding came too late to be effective. The motion to dismiss it should have been granted when first made. The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court with direction to dismiss the indictment.\n\n\n52\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n53\nMr. Justice JACKSON and Mr. Justice CLARK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n54\nMr. Justice REED, with whom The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice MINTON join, dissenting.\n\n\n55\nThe limitation for prosecutions under the second clause of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371, conspiracy to defraud the United States, formerly fixed at three years by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3282, limitation for offenses not capital, is suspended for us by the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3287, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3287. The Code sections so far as applicable appear below.1 As stated in the Court's opinion the indictment under \u00a7 371 was brought more than three years after the alleged offense but within time if the wartime suspension applies. The applicability of that section, \u00a7 3287, depends upon whether the conspiracy charged in the indictment was an offense 'involving fraud * * * against the United States * * * in any manner, whether by conspiracy or not,' within the meaning of said \u00a7 3287.\n\n\n56\nAn indictment under \u00a7 371 may be found for conspiracy to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States. These are alternative, disjunctive provisions. One addresses itself to the conspiracy to commit substantive offenses specified under other statutes; the other to a conspiracy to defraud the United States. Such a conspiracy is itself the substantive offense charged in the indictment. This construction has been accepted by the courts without variation.2\n\n\n57\nThe indictment, Count I, charges conspiracy 'to defraud the United States by impairing, obstructing, and defeating the proper administration of its naturalization laws' by causing Bridges falsely and fraudulently to state that he 'had never belonged to the Communist Party in the United States.' We think that this alleged offense, since it is an effort to defraud the United States by impairing or obstructing or defeating its naturalization laws obviously falls within the terms of the suspension of limitations, \u00a7 3287, 'involving fraud' 'by conspiracy.'\n\n\n58\nWe see nothing in the legislative history of \u00a7 3287 to raise a question as to its applicability to this indictment. The opinion of the Court quotes excerpts from reports concerning the need of suspension of limitation following the First World War. A statute was then passed, which we accept as having been enacted for the same purpose and with the same coverage as the present legislation. See n. 15 of the Court's opinion. Those reports do show that war frauds of a pecuniary nature were uppermost in the minds of Congress. Court's opinion, n. 17. This was only natural in view of the haste and waste of war but it does not follow logically that frauds against the proper exercise of governmental functions are excluded. The cited excerpts do not specifically exclude them. Certainly frauds impairing, obstructing or defeating selective service,3 alien property,4 administration of prices and wages5 and the allotment of scarce material,6 as well as the Immigration and Nationality Act, would hardly be omitted knowingly by Congress from a suspension of limitation for frauds against the Government. Yet, many of these would fall under the Court's interpretation that wartime suspension applies only to war frauds of a pecuniary nature or of a nature concerning property. It was as hard, perhaps harder, to find and punish frauds against administration as those of a pecuniary or property nature. A general amnesty bill against war frauds would be fairer than to hold only those guilty of financial frauds. Both the purpose and the language of the Suspension Act lead to the conclusion that frauds against administration are within its scope.\n\n\n59\nThe Court asserts that the Wartime Suspension Act should be limited to those frauds of a pecuniary or property nature because the Act is an exception to a 'long standing congressional 'policy of repose.\" Of course, statutes of limitation are statutes of repose. But our public policy is fixed by Congress, not the courts.7 The public policy on repose for wartime frauds is fixed by the Suspension Act and it is the words of that Act that determine our policy, not some general feeling that litigation over frauds should end.\n\n\n60\nNor can we accept the Court's reliance on Marzani v. United States, 83 U.S.App.D.C. 78, 168 F.2d 133, 137, as a sound precedent for construing the WartimeSuspension of Limitations Act to apply only to frauds of a pecuniary or property nature. On review this Court was evenly divided. The Court of Appeals held that the Wartime Suspension Act did not apply because '(t)he Supreme Court has clearly said (1) that a statute identical in pertinent part with the Suspension Act does not apply to offenses of which defrauding the United States in a pecuniary way is not an essential ingredient; and (2) that such defrauding of the United States is not an essential ingredient of offenses under the False Claims statute.' 168 F.2d at page 136. Marzani was indicted under the False Claims Act.8\n\n\n61\nThe cases relied upon for the first point are United States v. Noveck, 271 U.S. 201, 46 S.Ct. 476, 70 L.Ed. 904; United States v. McElvain, 272 U.S. 633, 47 S.Ct. 219, 71 L.Ed. 451, and United States v. Scharton, 285 U.S. 518, 52 S.Ct. 416, 76 L.Ed. 917. Noveck's case held an indictment for perjury in an income tax return was barred, despite a suspension statute much like \u00a7 3287, because fraud was not an element of the crime of perjury. McElvain's case held similarly as to the substantive offense of a willful attempt to evade a tax. Scharton's case followed Noveck and held that fraud on the United States was not an ingredient of evading a tax by false statements.\n\n\n62\nUnder the second point, the Court of Appeals relied upon United States v. Gilliland, 312 U.S. 86, 61 S.Ct. 518, 85 L.Ed. 598. There this Court held that the 1934 Amendment to Criminal Code \u00a7 35, 48 Stat. 996, enlarged \u00a7 35 so as to include false representations in any documents 'within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States.' 312 U.S., at page 90, 61 S.Ct. at page 521. Thus the former holding of this Court that the False Claims Act was restricted to 'pecuniary or property loss', United States v. Cohn, 270 U.S. 339, 346, 46 S.Ct. 251, 253, 70 L.Ed. 616, was made inapplicable to the section as amended. The Court of Appeals, however, thought that the Gilliland decision meant that defrauding the United States in a financial sense is not a constituent ingredient under the False Claims Act. Therefore the Suspension Act did not apply. Cf. United States v. Gottfried, 2 Cir., 165 F.2d 360, 367. It is immaterial whether the Court of Appeals was correct in thinking that defrauding the United States in a financial sense was an essential ingredient of the False Claims Act. We think it clear that defrauding the United States is an essential ingredient of this charge of conspiracy under \u00a7 371. We do not think Marzani adds strength to the Court's position that the Suspension Act applies only to financial fraud.\n\n\n63\nThe cases both under the first and second points of the Marzani decision deal with the suspension statutes as applied to substantive crimes that did not require proof of fraud against the United States for conviction. It was enough that the charge and proof showed perjury, false swearing or misrepresentation to a government agency. Fraud was not an essential ingredient. The contrary is true in the present prosecution under Count I.\n\n\n64\nAs we showed in the second paragraph of this opinion, the substantive crime here charged is the conspiracy to defraud the United States, punishable as a conspiracy. The fraud is an essential element. There can be no doubt that this crime, denounced by \u00a7 371, covers nonpecuniary or nonproperty frauds. This has been true since Haas v. Henkel, 216 U.S. 462, 479, 30 S.Ct. 249, 253, 54 L.Ed. 569.9 We do not agree with the Court's analysis of the indictment that the offenses charged in Count I are 'knowingly making a false statement' in a naturalization proceeding or aiding to obtain a certificate of naturalization by fraud. These are the overt acts of the Count I conspiracy, not the substantive offense of defrauding the Government in its administrative processes charged in Count I.\n\n\n65\nAs Count I describes the substantive offense of conspiracy to defraud the United States, we do not agree with the Court's statement that:\n\n\n66\n'The use in Count I of language copied from the second clause      of the conspiracy statute merely cloaks a factual charge of      conspiring to cause, or knowingly to aid, Bridges to make a      false statement under oath in his naturalization proceeding,      or to obtain by false statements a Certificate of      Naturalization to which he was not entitled.'\n\n\n67\nTo prove the substantive offense of conspiracy under \u00a7 371 it is necessary to prove the fraud. It cannot be said that a false statement as to Communist membership in a naturalization hearing would not be a fraud against the administration of the naturalization laws within the language of Haas v. Henkel, supra, of 'impairing, obstructing, or defeating the lawful function of any department of government.' 216 U.S. at page 479, 30 S.Ct. at page 254.\n\n\n68\nWe therefore would affirm the judgment below as to Count I. Petitioners have also contended here that the conviction is barred because the principles of res judicata or collateral estoppel require us to hold that Bridges' nonmembership during the crucial period has been judicially determined. They point to the Landis proceedings of 1938, referred to in Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135, 138, 65 S.Ct. 1443, 1445, 89 L.Ed. 2103, this Court's decision in that case, and the naturalization proceedings themselves of 1945. None of these, though are res judicata, since this is a criminal cause. Nor can collateral estoppel be invoked. There has been no court holding that Bridges has not been a Communist. The Landis determination of then nonmembership was not a judicial one. Pearson v. Williams, 202 U.S. 281, 26 S.Ct. 608, 50 L.Ed. 1029. In Bridges v. Wixon, supra, no holding on the factual question of membership was reached. And the naturalization proceedings did not determine nonmembership because Bridges could legally have been granted citizenship even had he been found by the Court to have been a member of the Communist Party. See 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 705, 707, which merely prohibited grant of naturalization to members of organizations advocating the overthrow of the government, or to those not attached to the Constitution. This has been changed. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1424(a)(2), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1424(a)(2). There is no necessary identity in law between Communist Party members and such persons. See Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U.S. 118, 63 S.Ct. 1333, 87 L.Ed. 1796. Cf. Carlson v. Landon, 342 U.S. 524, 536, n. 22, 72 S.Ct. 525, 532, 96 L.Ed. 547.\n\n\n69\nAs our views have not prevailed as to Count I, we forbear to express any views as to Counts II and III.\n\n\n\n1\n 18 U.S.C.

Since September 1, 1948, 18 U.S.C. (Supp. V) \u00a7 3287, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3287, has provided that\u2014\n'When the United States is at war the running of any statute of limitations applicable to any offense (1) involving fraud or attempted fraud against the United States or any agency thereof in any manner, whether by conspiracy or not, or (2) committed in connection with the acquisition, care, handling, custody, control or disposition of any real or personal property of the United States, or (3) committed in connection with the negotiation, procurement, award, performance, payment for, interim financing, cancelation, or other termination or settlement, of any contract, subcontract, or purchase order which is connected with or related to the prosecution of the war, or with any disposition of termination inventory by any war contractor or Government agency, shall be suspended until three years after the termination of hostilities as proclaimed by the President or by a concurrent resolution of Congress. * * *'\nThe President proclaimed the termination of hostilities of World War II, December 31, 1946. 3 CFR, 1946 Supp. 77\u201478.\n\n\n16\n 'Sec. 1044. * * *: Provided, however, That in offenses involving the defrauding or attempts to defraud the United States or any agency thereof, whether by conspiracy or not, and in any manner, and now indictable under any existing statutes, the period of limitation shall be six years. * * *' 42 Stat. 220, November 17, 1921.\nThis proviso was eliminated by 45 Stat. 51, December 27, 1927.\n\n\n17\n In 1921, H.R.Rep.No. 365, 67th Cong., 1st Sess. 1, supporting the bill to enact the proviso, said:\n'The Department of Justice has been engaged in the investigation and is now engaged in the investigation of various alleged offenses, consisting largely of frauds against the Government which are claimed to have occurred during the war with Germany and since its conclusion. Many of these alleged offenses grew out of the (contractual) relation of the Government with various persons and corporations engaged in the furnishing of military and naval supplies of various kinds. Many of these transactions require the most minute investigation in order to ascertain the exact facts, and in every case a considerable period must elapse before such facts may be gathered from the files and other sources that the department may know whether prosecutions are justified or not. In many cases months, and perhaps considerable longer periods, will be required for such investigations.' See also, 61 Cong.Rec. 7060\u20147061, 7640.\nIn 1927, H.R.Rep.No. 16, 70th Cong., 1st Sess. 1, supporting the bill to eliminate the 1921 proviso, said:\n'In 1921 the Attorney General represented that he was desirous of having further time to investigate alleged war frauds, and that owing to the nature of the investigations the statute of limitations might run before it would be possible to obtain indictments, and he therefore requested that the period of the statute of limitations applicable to conspiracy to defraud the Government of the United States should be extended from three years to six years. The Congress complied with the request and the limitation was extended from three to six years so to that particular class of offenses.\n'The reasons for the above change have ceased to exist; that is, the Department of Justice announced some time ago that it did not propose to attempt any further prosecution of offenses of that character, that is to say, offenses giving rise to the statute.' See also, 69 Cong.Rec. 473, 842.\n\n\n18\n In 1942, S.Rep.No. 1544, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 1, 2, supporting the suspension of the running of the statute, said:\n'The purpose of the proposed legislation is to suspend any existing statutes of limitations applicable to offenses involving the defrauding or attempts to defraud the United States or any agency thereof, for the period of the present war. Contracting for the United States is done through its various agencies, including the departments and independent establishments and Government-owned and Government-controlled corporations, and frauds against all of these agencies are intended to be embraced by the bill.\n'During the World War many frauds committed against the Government were not discovered until the 3-year statute of limitations had almost expired, and as stated in the committee report hereinafter referred to, many of the alleged offenses were barred from prosecution. The general criminal statute of limitations (Rev.Stats., sec. 1044) was amended on November 17, 1921, extending the period to 6 years in respect to offenses involving frauds against the United States. * * *\n'During normal times the present 3-year statute of limitations may afford the Department of Justice sufficient time to investigate, discover, and gather evidence to prosecute frauds against the Government. The United States, however, is engaged in a gigantic war program. Huge sums of money are being expended for materials and equipment in order to carry on the war successfully. Although steps have been taken to prevent and to prosecute frauds against the Government, it is recognized that in the varied dealings opportunities will no doubt be presented for unscrupulous persons to defraud the Government or some agency. These frauds may be difficult to discover as is often true of this type of offense and many of them may not come to light for some time to come. The law-enforcement branch of the Government is also busily engaged in its many duties, including the enforcement of the espionage, sabotage, and other laws.'\nA similar statement was made in H.R.Rep.No. 2051, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 1\u20142, supporting the same bill H.R. 6484. See also, 88 Cong.Rec. 6160. This bill, readopting the 1921 policy, was introduced at the suggestion of the Attorney General in lieu of a proposal then pending to suspend the running of the statute of limitations for every offense punishable under the laws of the United States.

{"text":"389 U.S. 109\n88 S.Ct. 258\n19 L.Ed.2d 319\nJames Cleveland BURGETT, Petitioner,v.STATE OF TEXAS.\nNo. 53.\nArgued Oct. 18, 1967.\nDecided Nov. 13, 1967.\n\nR. Gordon Gooch, Houston, Tex., for petitioner.\nLeon B. Douglas, Austin, Tex., for respondent.\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner was convicted of 'assault with malice aforethought with intent to murder; repetition of offense.' The jury fixed the punishment at 10 years in the Texas State Penitentiary.1 On appeal, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed petitioner's conviction.2 We granted certiorari, 386 U.S. 931, 87 S.Ct. 959, 17 L.Ed.2d 805.\n\n\n2\nPetitioner was charged in a five-count indictment. In the first count the State alleged that he had cut one Bradley with a knife and had stabbed at Bradley's throat with intent to kill. Pursuant to the Texas recidivist statutes,3 the remaining counts of the indictment consisted of allegations that petitioner had incurred four previous felony convictions: a Texas conviction for burglary, and three Tennessee convictions for forgery.  If these allegations were found to be true, petitioner would be subject to a term of life imprisonment upon conviction of the offense charged in count one.4\n\n\n3\nPetitioner's counsel filed a pretrial motion to quash the four counts of the indictment referring to the prior convictions for failure to apprise the defense of what the State would attempt to prove.5 The record is silent as to the court's action on this motion. But when the indictment was read to the jury at the beginning of the trial, before any evidence was introduced, the four counts relating to the prior convictions were included.\n\n\n4\nDuring the course of the trial, while the jury was present, the State offered into evidence a certified copy of one of the Tennessee convictions. The conviction read in part, 'Came the Assistant Attorney-General for the State and the Defendant in proper person and without Counsel.' Petitioner's counsel objected to the introduction of the record on the ground that the judgment on its face showed that petitioner was not represented by counsel in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. There was no indication in the record that counsel had been waived. The court stated that it would reserve ruling on the objection, apparently to give the State an opportunity to offer any of the other convictions into evidence. The State then offered a second version of the same Tennessee conviction which stated that petitioner had appeared 'in proper person' but did not contain the additional words 'without counsel.' This second version also stated that 'After said jury had heard the evidence, argument of counsel, and the charge of the Court, they retired to consider of their verdict.' It is not clear, however, whether 'counsel' was being used in the singular or plural, and in any event no explanation was offered for the discrepancy between the two records. Petitioner's counsel objected to this section version on the same ground. The court again reserved its ruling.\n\n\n5\nThe State then offered into evidence a certified copy of the indictment in the prior Texas case. Petitioner's counsel indicated he had no objection, and that record was received into evidence. Thereafter, testimony was offered concerning the judgment and sentence in the prior Texas case. After some testimony had been given, the jury was excused and the hearing continued out of its presence. At the conclusion of the hearing, petitioner's attorney objected that the Texas judgment was void on its face under state law. The court sustained that objection, and the record of the Texas conviction was stricken from evidence. At the same time, the court sustained petitioner's objection to the first version of the Tennessee conviction; but overruled the objection to the second version of the same conviction. The jury was then recalled and testimony was heard on the substantive offense charged. The next reference to the prior convictions was when th court instructed the jury not to consider the prior offenses6 for any purpose whatsoever in arriving at the verdict.\n\n\n6\nPetitioner's motion for a new trial was denied. In the Court of Criminal Appeals, petitioner argued, inter alia, that the court erred in permitting counts two through five of the indictment to be read to the jury at the beginning of the trial, and in failing to sustain petitioner's objection to the admission into evidence of the second version of the Tennessee conviction. The Court of Criminal Appeals held that since petitioner had not suffered the enhanced punishment provided by the recidivist statutes, and since the instruction to disregard the prior offenses had been given, no error was presented.\n\n\n7\nWe do not sit as a court of criminal appeals to review state cases. The States are free to provide such procedures as they choose, including rules of evidence, provided that none of them infringes a guarantee in the Federal Constitution. The recent right-to-counsel cases, starting with Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, are illustrative of the limitations which the Constitution places on state criminal procedures. Those limitations sometimes touch rules of evidence.\n\n\n8\nThe exclusion of coerced confessions is one example. Chambers v. State of Florida, 309 U.S. 227, 60 S.Ct. 472, 84 L.Ed. 716.\n\n\n9\nThe exclusion of evidence seized in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments is another. Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081.\n\n\n10\nStill another is illustrated by Pointer v. State of Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923. In that case we held that a transcript of a preliminary hearing had to be excluded from a state criminal trial because the defendant had no lawyer at that hearing, and did not, therefore, have the opportunity to cross-examine the principal witness against him who since that time had left the State. The exclusionary rule that we fashioned was designed to protect the privilege of confrontation guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment and made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth.\n\n\n11\nThe same result must follow here. Gideon v. Wainwright established the rule that the right to counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment was applicable to the States by virtue of the Fourteenth, making it unconstitutional to try a person for a felony in a state court unless he had a lawyer or had validly waived one. And that ruling was not limited to prospective applications. See Doughty v. Maxwell, 376 U.S. 202, 84 S.Ct. 702, 11 L.Ed.2d 650; Pickelsimer v. Wainwright, 375 U.S. 2, 84 S.Ct. 80, 11 L.Ed.2d 41. In this case the certified records of the Tennessee conviction on their face raise a presumption that petitioner was denied his right to counsel in the Tennessee proceeding, and therefore that his conviction was void. Presuming waiver of counsel from a silent record is impermissible. Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U.S. 506, 82 S.Ct. 884, 8 L.Ed.2d 70. To permit a conviction obtained in violation of Gideon v. Wainwright to be used against a person either to support guilt or enhance punishment for another offense (see Greer v. Beto, 384 U.S. 269, 86 S.Ct. 1477) is to erode the principle of that case. Worse yet, since the defect in the prior conviction was denial of the right to counsel, the accused in effect suffers anew from the deprivation of that Sixth Amendment right.\n\n\n12\nThe admission of a prior criminal conviction which is constitutionally infirm under the standards of Gideon v. Wainwright is inherently prejudicial and we are unable to say that the instructions to disregard it7 made the constitutional error 'harmless beyond a reasonable doubt' within the meaning of Chapman v. State of California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705.\n\n\n13\nOur decision last Term in Spencer v. State of Texas, 385 U.S. 554, 87 S.Ct. 648, 17 L.Ed.2d 606, is not relevant to our present problem. In Spencer the prior convictions were not presumptively void. Moreover, the contention was that the guilt phase of the trial was prejudiced by the introduction of the evidence of prior crimes. As the Court noted, '(i)n the procedures before us, * * * no specific federal right\u2014such as that dealing with confessions\u2014is involved; reliance is placed solely on a general 'fairness' approach.' Id., at 565, 87 S.Ct. at 654. In this case, however, petitioner's right to counsel, a 'specific federal right,' is being denied anew. This Court cannot permit such a result unless Gideon v. Wainwright is to suffer serious erosion.\n\n\n14\nReversed.\n\n\n15\nMr. Chief Justice WARREN, concurring.\n\n\n16\nI am in full agreement with the opinion of the Court and the reasons stated therein for reversing the conviction in this case. However, in view of the terse dissent entered by my Brother Harlan, I feel constrained to add some observations of my own.\n\n\n17\nThe dissent refers to the Court's decision in Spencer v. State of Texas, 385 U.S. 554, 87 S.Ct. 648, 17 L.Ed.2d 606, and the entire thrust of the dissent is reminiscent of that decision of last Term which placed this Court's stamp of approval on the Texas recidivist procedures from which this case evolves. The dissent reminds us that '(w)e do not sit as a court of errors and appeals in state cases.' I would not disagree with that statement is an abstract proposition. But we are not dealing with abstracts in this case. We are dealing with a very real denial of a state criminal defendant's rights as guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. We are also told by the dissent that 'this case shows no prosecutorial bad faith or intentional misconduct.' But this misses the mark. We are not limited in our review of constitutional errors in state criminal proceedings to those errors which flow from 'prosecutorial bad faith or intentional misconduct.'1 Our concern is with the effect of those errors, whether well-intentioned or not,2 on the constitutionally protected right of a criminal defendant to a fair and impartial trial.\n\n\n18\nThis case is a classic example of how a rule eroding the procedural rights of a criminal defendant on trial for his life or liberty can assume avalanche proportions, burying beneath it the integrity of the fact-finding process. In Spencer, the Court approved a procedure whereby a State, for the sole purpose of enhancing punishment, includes in the indictment allegations of prior crimes which are read to the jury and enters evidence at trial of those prior crimes, no matter how unrelated they might be to the charge on which the defendant is being tried. The rule adopted in Spencer went so far as to allow the State to enter evidence on the prior crimes even though a defendant might be willing to stipulate the earlier convictions. In this case, that harsh rule was expanded to a degree close to barbarism.\n\n\n19\nIn addition to charging the petitioner with the principal crime of 'assault with malice aforethought with intent to murder,' the indictment alleged four prior convictions, one in Texas and three in Tennessee. Despite the efforts of the petitioner's attorney to quash those portions of the indictment referring to the prior crimes, the entire indictment was read to the jury at the start of the petitioner's one-day trial. The prosecutor then proceeded to offer evidence of the prior convictions. The petitioner's attorney objected to evidence of one Tennessee conviction because a certified copy of that conviction showed that the petitioner had not been represented by counsel. The trial judge reserved his ruling on the objection. The prosecution next offered a second version of that same Tennessee conviction which omitted any reference to the absence of counsel but which did not show a waiver of counsel. The petitioner's attorney again objected and the trial judge again reserved his ruling. The prosecutor then offered into evidence a certified copy of the indictment in the prior Texas case, and it was received without objection. All this occurred in the presence of the jury. However, when the petitioner's attorney objected to evidence concerning the judgment and sentence in the prior Texas case, the jury was excused and testimony was taken out of the presence of the jury. At the close of that evidence and before the jury returned, the trial judge ruled that the prior Texas conviction was void under state law. In addition, the trial judge sustained the objection to the first version of the Tennessee conviction but overruled the objection to the second version of the same conviction.3 The jury then returned and the trial continued. The next the jury was to hear of the prior convictions was a brief instruction from the trial judge advising the jurors not to consider the prior crimes for any purpose. The jury was never told, however, that two of the prior convictions charged were void and that the prosecution had failed to offer testimony on the validity of the other prior crimes charged in the indictment.\n\n\n20\nThus, the jury went into its deliberations knowing that the petitioner had been convicted and imprisoned for four prior felonies, although not one had been proven at the trial. To expect that the jury could wipe this from its memory and decide the petitioner's guilt only on the basis of the evidence of assault is to place too much faith in a jury's ability to detach itself from reality. This is particularly true since the trial judge gave the jurors not the slightest clue as to why matters which consumed so much time at trial were suddenly being removed from their consideration.\n\n\n21\nTo suggest that such a procedure accords a man charged with a crime due process is beyond belief. This Court has reversed convictions in other cases based on unfair influences on juries which must be deemed minor when compared to the pervasive prejudice in this case. Not long ago we ruled that a defendant was denied due process when a court bailiff remarked in the presence of the jurors, 'Oh that wicked fellow, he is guilty'; and, 'If there is anything wrong (in the verdict) the Supreme Court will correct it.' Parker v. Gladden, 385 U.S. 363, 87 S.Ct. 468, 17 L.Ed.2d 420. We also reversed a murder conviction because two prosecution witnesses were deputy sheriffs who had been assigned to accompany the jury while it was sequestered. Turner v. State of Louisiana, 379 U.S. 466, 85 S.Ct. 546, 13 L.Ed.2d 424.4 If these transgressions offend constitutional standards of fairness, can it be doubted that the petitioner's trial was stripped of all vestiges of due process when the jurors were told of his prior void convictions and the error was not explained to them?\n\n\n22\nThis case is the frightful progeny of Spencer and of that decision's unjustified deviation from settled principles of fairness. Today we have placed a needed limitation on the Spencer rule, but nothing except an outright rejection would truly serve the cause of justice.\n\n\n23\nMr. Justice HARLAN, whom Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice WHITE join, dissenting.\n\n\n24\nThe record in this case shows no prosecutorial bad faith or intentional misconduct. To the extent that the prosecutor contemplated the use of prior convictions in a one-stage recidivist trial, his right to do so is of course established by Spencer v. State of Texas, 385 U.S. 554, 87 S.Ct. 648, 17 L.Ed.2d 606, decided only last Term. The fact that the prior convictions turned out to be inadmissible for other reasons involves at the most a later corrected trial error in the admission of evidence. We do not sit as a court of errors and appeals in state cases, and I would affirm the judgment of the state court.\n\n\n\n1\n The maximum penalty for a first conviction of assault with intent to murder is 25 years; the minimum penalty is two years. Tex.Pen.Code, Art. 1160 (Supp.1966).\n\n\n2\n Burgett v. State of Texas, Tex.Cr.App., 397 S.W.2d 79 (1965).\n\n\n3\n The statutes involved here are Articles 62 and 63 of the Tex.Pen.Code (1952).\nArticle 62 provides: 'It is be shown on the trial of a felony less than capital that the defendant has been before convicted of the same offense, or one of the samd nature, the punishment on such second or other subsequent conviction shall be the highest which is affixed to the commission of such offenses in ordinary cases.'\nArticle 63 provides: 'Whoever shall have been three times convicted of a felony less than capital shall on such third conviction be imprisoned for life in the penitentiary.'\n\n\n4\n Tex.Pen.Code, Art. 63 (1952).\n\n\n5\n In petitioner's amended motion for a new trial, which was denied by the court, he explained that the purpose of the pretrial motion was 'so that defendant could establish their (the previous convictions alleged for enhancement) admissibility before they were read into the record in the presence of the jury; same reading into the record in the presence of the jury was prejudicial to defendant herein.'\n\n\n6\n The court apparently withdrew consideration of the prior convictions from the jury since only the record of the one prior Tennessee conviction for forgery had been accepted. Thus, Article 63 could not be applied to petitioner. Further, since forgery could not be considered as an offense of the 'same nature' as assault with intent to murder, Article 62 would not be applicable. See n. 3, supra.\nThe State apparently did not attempt to introduce the records of the other two Tennessee convictions for forgery because the indictment showed that all of the convictions occurred on the same date. To invoke the provisions of Article 63, each succeeding conviction must be subsequent in time to the previous conviction both with respect to commission of the offense and to conviction. Cowan v. State, 172 Tex.Cr.R. 183, 355 S.W.2d 521 (1962).\n\n\n7\n See, e.g., Boyd v. United States, 142 U.S. 450, 12 S.Ct. 292, 35 L.Ed. 1077; United States v. Clarke, 343 F.2d 90 (C.A.3d Cir. 1965). Cf. Waldron v. Waldron, 156 U.S. 361, 383, 15 S.Ct. 383, 389, 39 L.Ed. 453; Throckmorton v. Holt, 180 U.S. 552, 21 S.Ct. 474, 45 L.Ed. 663; Lawrence v. United States, 357 F.2d 434 (C.A.10th Cir. 1966); United States v. DeDominicis, 332 F.2d 207 (C.A.2d Cir. 1964).\nWhat Mr. Justice Jackson said in Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440, 445, 453, 69 S.Ct. 716, 723, 93 L.Ed. 790 (concurring opinion), in the sensitive area of conspiracy is equally applicable in this sensitive area of repetitive crimes, 'The naive assumption that prejudicial effects can be overcome by instructions to the jury * * * all practicing lawyers know to be unmitigated fiction.'\n\n\n1\n Prosecutorial bad faith, of course, is not an irrelevant element in our review of state criminal convictions. It can often make even more intolerable errors which demand correction in this Court. See, e.g., Miller v. Pate, 386 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 785, 17 L.Ed.2d 690; Napue v. People of State of Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217; Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103, 55 S.Ct. 340, 79 L.Ed. 791.\n\n\n2\n The dissent is not alone in viewing this case solely in terms of the prosecutor's good or bad faith. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals disposed of the petitioner's objection to the use of the prior void convictions at trial with the cryptic observation that '(t)here is no showing of bad faith on the part of the state in alleging or attempting to prove the prior convictions.' Boswell tells us that Dr. Johnson once observed that 'Hell is paved with good intentions.' Boswell, Life of Samuel Johnson 257 (Great Books ed. 1952). If the good-faith view of this case should prevail, then surely this petitioner's road to prison would be paved with the same good intentions.\n\n\n3\n The record is silent concerning the second and third Tennessee convictions alleged in the indictment, and the prosecution apparently did not offer any evidence on those convictions. However, the jury had been made aware of those prior crimes when the indictment was read at the start of the trial.\n\n\n4\n I do not mean to express any disapproval of our decisions in Parker and Turner. I joined both of those opinions and I have no doubt the practices condemned in those cases were at odds with settled principles of due process of law. However, it follows a fortiori from those decisions that we are presented in this case with a violation of due process.\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"438 U.S. 190\n98 S.Ct. 2692\n57 L.Ed.2d 693\nH. W. BERRY et al.v.J. D. DOLES, etc., et al.\nNo. 76-1690.\nJune 26, 1978.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nThis appeal presents a challenge to the scope of the remedy allowed by a three-judge District Court for the Middle District of Georgia for failure of appellees to comply with the approval provisions of \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 439, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c (1970 ed., Supp. V).\n\n\n2\nIn 1968, the State of Georgia enacted a statute intended to stagger the terms of the three members of the Peach County Board of Commissioners of Roads and Revenues.  The then-existing statute, adopted in 1964, provided that all three posts were to be filled at four-year intervals.  By operation of the 1968 amendment, the single at-large member was to be elected to a two-year term in 1968 and to a four-year term at subsequent general elections.  Appellees concede, and the three-judge court f und, that the 1968 statute constituted a change in voting procedures subject to the provisions of \u00a7 5 and that the change had been implemented without first having been submitted for approval either to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or to the Attorney General as required by \u00a7 5.\n\n\n3\nFour days prior to the August 10, 1976, primary election for the two seats on the Board not including the at-large post, appellants filed this action to enforce the requirements of \u00a7 5. Appellants' requests for declaratory and injunctive relief were not acted upon until after the scheduled 1976 primary and general elections.\n\n\n4\nOn February 28, 1977, the three-judge court, without a hearing, enjoined further enforcement of the 1968 statute until such time as appellees effected compliance with \u00a7 5.  However, the District Court refused appellants' request to set aside the 1976 elections, noting \"the rather technical changes made in the county's election law by the 1968 amendment and, more important, the apparent lack of any discriminatory purpose or effect surrounding the use of the law in the 1976 elections.\"  In expressly limiting its order to prospective relief, the District Court also relied on our decision in Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 89 S.Ct. 817, 22 L.Ed.2d 1 (1969).\n\n\n5\nOn April 26, 1977, the three-judge court denied appellants' motion for reconsideration.\n\n\n6\nIn this Court, appellants take the position that the relief awarded in this case is wholly inadequate in failing to remedy the existing \u00a7 5 violation.  Appellants assert that by refusing either to set aside the 1976 election or to order that all three Board members be elected in 1978, the District Court, at least until the 1980 election, leaves undisturbed the effects of the \u00a7 5 violation, thereby acknowledging that, at least for a time, local officials may successfully disregard \u00a7 5 requirements.\n\n\n7\nAppellees urge us to affirm the District Court judgment on grounds that the 1976 election involved the two Board posts which were not mentioned in the 1968 statute.  Accordingly, appellees argue, election to these posts is not subject to \u00a7 5.  However, even assuming that the District Court had the power to effect one of the alternative remedies suggested by appellants, appellees believe that the court below was correct in refusing to do so.\n\n\n8\nAt our request, the United States, as amicus curiae, has filed a brief in this case.  The Government takes the view, espoused by appellants, that the 1976 election was affected by the voting change prescribed in the 1968 statute and that the District Court's failure to require prompt compliance with \u00a7 5 permits the violation to continue.  It is the submission of the United States that the question whether the staggering of Board terms provided for by state statute in this case necessarily has a racially discriminatory effect should properly be promptly submitted to either the District Court for the District of Columbia or to the Attorney General in conformity with the approval procedures set forth in \u00a7 5.\n\n\n9\nIn Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U.S. 379, 91 S.Ct. 431, 27 L.Ed.2d 476 (1971), decided after Allen, supra, we had occasion to address the remedy issue which now confronts us.  We indicated in that case that \"[i]n certain circumstances  . . .  it might be appropriate to enter an order affording local officials an opportunity to seek federal approval and ordering a new election only if local officials fail to do so or if the required federal approval is not forthcoming.\"  400 U.S., at 396-397, 91 S.Ct., at 441.  The circumstances present here make such a course appropriate.\n\n\n10\nIn this case, appellees' undisputed obligation to submit the 1968 voting law change to a forum designated by Congress has not been discharged.  We conclude that the requirement of federal scrutiny imposed by \u00a7 5 should be satisfied by appellees without further delay.  Accordingly, we adopt the suggestion of the United States that the District Court shoul  enter an order allowing appellees 30 days within which to apply for approval of the 1968 voting change under \u00a7 5.  If approval is obtained, the matter will be at an end.  If approval is denied, appellants are free to renew to the District Court their request for simultaneous election of all members of the Board at the 1978 general election.\n\n\n11\nThe judgment of the District Court is affirmed insofar as it holds that appellees have violated the approval provisions of \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act;  the judgment is reversed insofar as it denies affirmative relief, and the case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to issue an order allowing appellees 30 days within which to apply for approval of the 1968 voting change under \u00a7 5, and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n12\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n13\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL joins, concurring.\n\n\n14\nI join the Court's opinion.  The Court is surely correct that the District Court committed reversible error by not, at the very least, ordering the Peach County officials to seek preclearance of the voting change enforced in the 1976 election and affording appellants the opportunity, if prior approval is not granted, to seek an order that would cut short the terms of the two Commissioners elected in 1976 and require a new election under the pre-1968 law.  The District Court manifestly erred in refusing to order such relief on the basis of its conclusion that the change was \"rather technical\" with no \"apparent discriminatory purpose or effect.\"  Nothing could be clearer than that a district court other, of course, than the District Court for the District of Columbia\u2014has no jurisdiction to assess the purpose or effect of any voting change.  See, e. g., United States v. Board of Supervisors, 429 U.S. 642, 97 S.Ct. 833, 51 L.Ed.2d 106 (1977); Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U.S. 379, 385, 91 S.Ct. 431, 435, 27 L.Ed.2d 476 (1971).\n\n\n15\nAlthough the Court does not reach this issue, I think it clear that, if the Peach County officials do not hereafter obtain federal preclearance for the 1968 change, the District Court must order a new election for all three posts at the earliest feasible time\u2014that here being the regularly scheduled 1978 election.  For if a designated federal entity cannot hereafter approve the 1968 voting change as racially neutral, it follows necessarily that there is a substantial probability that the 1976 election itself perpetrated racial discrimination in voting.  To permit the results of the 1976 election to stand in the face of such a determination would be to do precisely what \u00a7 5 was designed to forbid:  allow the burdens of litigation and delay to operate in favor of the perpetrators and against the victims of possibly racially discriminatory practices.  See South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 335, 86 S.Ct. 803, 822, 15 L.Ed.2d 769 (1966).\n\n\n16\nHowever, while I, therefore, agree that the District Court committed reversible error, I am also of the view that, in the circumstances of this case, a strong argument can be made that, whether or not preclearance can be obtained, the only sufficient remedy is to set aside the 1976 election and order a new election under the pre-1968 law.  Here, the Peach County officials could not have reasonably believed at the time of the 1976 election that the 1968 voting change could continue to be validly enforced without obtaining prior federal approval;  thus the situation is quite different from that present in cases like Perkins v. Matthews, supra, where the scope of the \u00a7 5 duty had been unsettled at the time of the election that was under attack.\n\n\n17\nIf, in cases like the present one, the remedy of ordering a new election is not to be required in all cases, the political units covered by \u00a7 5 may have a positive incentive flagrantly to disregard their clear obligations and not to seek preclearance of proposed voting changes.  For covered jurisdictions will then know that a \u00a7 5 violation, if a suit is brough , can only result in their being denied the right to continue to enforce those voting changes that could not have received federal approval in the first place.  As to all other voting changes, the sole effect of a suit for noncompliance with the approval provisions will be the limited sanction of requiring the political unit to obtain the federal approval which it should have received before any change was instituted.\n\n\n18\nThe legislative background of \u00a7 5 strongly suggests to me that Congress expressly intended to preclude such a state of affairs.  Section 5, of course, was intended to prevent those States which had a history of racial discrimination in voting from adhering to their long-established practices of continually contriving new laws to deprive blacks of any newly won voting rights.  Congress sought to place the burden of inertia and litigation delay on the perpetrators of the discrimination by requiring affected States voluntarily to submit any new law affecting voting for federal approval before it became effective. The remedial theory the Court embraces today may retard, not further, the objective of having polities voluntarily comply with \u00a7 5, for a possible consequence may well be that a very large share of the burden of implementing federal policy will be placed on public and private enforcement.  We ought to have the benefit of full briefing and oral argument to help indicate whether this will be the case.\n\n\n19\nI do not regard Perkins v. Matthews, supra, as necessarily supporting the Court's decision.  While it is true that the Court there stated that there might be circumstances in which it would be appropriate to order a new election only if federal approval for the voting change were not procured within a specified time period, 400 U.S., at 396, 91 S.Ct., at 440, the context of this statement clearly suggests that it is intended to apply only to cases in which it had not been reasonably clear at the time of the election that the change was covered by \u00a7 5.  Ibid.*\n\n\n20\nHowever, since there is no disposition on the part of my colleagues to note probable jurisdiction and set the case down for oral argument, I join the Court's opinion.\n\n\n21\nMr. Justice POWELL, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n22\nAlthough I believe that the wiser course would be simply to affirm the judgment below, I go along reluctantly with the Court's resolution of this case rather than bring it here for argument.  I am willing to do this only because I consider it most unlikely that the Attorney General could find any reasoned basis for denying approval of the change at issue in this case.  Thus, it is improbable that the court below ever will have to pass on the request to cut short the terms of the two Commissioners elected in 1976 which the Court allows appellants to \"renew\" if the change is not approved.  Ante, at 193.  I write to emphasize my view that the three-judge court cannot be faulted for its common-sense handling of this case.  I do not understand the Court to disagree with this view.\n\n\n23\n* The facts and procedural posture of this case deserve a fuller treatment than the Court gives them.  Under a state law enacted in 1964, the Board of Commissioners of Roads and Revenues for Peach County, Ga., is composed of three members, assigned to numbered posts.  1964 Ga.Laws No. 800, \u00a7 1, p. 2627.  Posts 1 and 2 are filled by residents of designated districts, and Post 3 is elected at large.  Until 1968, all three posts were elected simultaneously for four-year terms.  In 1968, the Georgia Legislature enacted a statute providing for a partial staggering of the Commissio ers' terms.  1968 Ga.Laws No. 800, \u00a7 2A, p. 2473. Under the statute, Post 3, the at-large seat, was to be elected to a two-year term in 1968, and thereafter to four-year terms.  No change was made in the terms of the other two Commissioners.  The result is that the election for Post 3 no longer is held at the same time as the election for the other two posts.1\n\n\n24\nElections were held under the amendment in 1968, 1970, 1972, and 1974 without challenge.  It was only on August 6, 1976\u2014four days before the 1976 primary election\u2014that appellants filed this lawsuit seeking to enjoin that election and the general election on the ground that the amendment had not received the imprimatur of the Attorney General or the District Court for the District of Columbia as required by \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  A single judge of the District Court, acting promptly, ruled on appellants' motion for a preliminary injunction before the primary election was held.  That judge, \"seriously question[ing]\" whether the change even was covered by \u00a7 5, and apparently in view of the tardiness of the suit\u2014which to this day has not been explained sensibly refused to enjoin the election.  App. to Jurisdictional Statement 7a.\n\n\n25\nAfter the 1976 primary and general elections for Posts 1 and 2 had been held, a three-judge District Court was convened.  That court concluded that the 1968 amendment was subject to the preclearance requirements of \u00a7 5 after all, and it enjoined enforcement of the 1968 amendment until those requirements had been met.  \"Given the rather technical changes made in the county's election law by the 1968 amendment and, more important, the apparent lack of any discriminatory purpose or effect surrounding the use of the law in the 1976 elections,\" however, the court denied appellants' request to set aside those elections. Id., at 2a-3a, citing Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 571-572, 89 S.Ct. 817, 835, 22 L.Ed.2d 1 (1969).2  The three-judge court thereupon \"dissolve[d] itself and remand[ed] the case to the originating judge for such other and further proceedings consistent with this opinion as may be required.\"  App. to Jurisdictional Statement 4a.\n\n\n26\nAppellants then filed a motion for reconsideration and modification of the three-judge court's order.  In this motion appellants\u2014for the first time\u2014asked the three-judge court to order that all three posts stand for election in 1978 if the change was not approved by then, thus cutting short the terms of the two Commissioners elected in 1976.  See Jurisdictional Statement 7 n. 1, 15-16;  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 4.  The three-judge court refused to consider this belated request, stating: \"The problem of relief is a question for a single-judge court.\"  App. to Jurisdictional Statement 5a.  Appellants, however, did not accept this clear invitation to press their request before a single-judge court.\n\n\n27\nInstead, they brought the instant appeal, urging the Court either to set aside the 1976 elections, or to cut short the terms of the two Commissioners elected in 1976 by declaring all three posts open in 1978.  The United States as amicus curiae does not support appellants' request that the 1976 election be set aside. Neither does it support appellants' request that the Court declare all three posts open in 1978.  Instead, it seeks relief that appellants never have requested, either in the court below or in this Court.  It asks the Court to enter an order directing the District Court to give appellees 30 days within which to seek \u00a7 5 preclearance.  If preclearance is not sought or if the change is not approved, the United States then argues that the District Court should be directed to allow appellants \"to renew their request for election of all three members at the same time.\"  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 8.  The United States, like the Court today, see n. 7, infra, carefully takes no position on whether the District Court should grant such further relief if this request is \"renewed.\"\n\n\n28\nIn my view, the Court would be fully justified in holding that the United States, which is not a party to this suit and did not participate in the court below, is barred from injecting a new issue into the case by requesting the Court to grant relief that appellants themselves never have sought.  It would be equally justified in holding that appellants are barred from asking the Court to declare all three posts open in 1978 after the three-judge court declined to rule on this belated request and after appellants ignored that court's express invitation to press their request before a single-judge court.  As a general rule, this Court does not and should not allow parties or amici to raise issues here that were not raised in or ruled upon by the lower courts.  Neither should this Court encourage parties to bypass avenues of relief that are open to them in the lower courts.  The facts that the case is a Voting Rights Act case, and that the amicus is the United States, provide no justification for departing from these salutary principles.\n\nII\n\n29\nSince the Court has chosen, without explanation, to depart from these principles, I briefly address the question of relief that is presented.  Appellees do not challenge the three-judge court's holding that \u00a7 5, as it has been expanded by judicial decision since enactment of the 1968 amendment at issue here, requires preclearance of that amendment.  Nor do they challenge that court's entry of an injunction against enforcing the amendment in future elections until the change is approved.  All they ask is that if the change is not approved, such a ruling should not be applied retroactively to abrogate the result of elections already held.  In my view, there is much force to their plea.\n\n\n30\nThis case is a classic example of how \u00a7 5, enacted to further the exercise of an important constitutional right, has been judicially expanded to cover the most inconsequential change in any aspect of election procedure.3  Given this expansion, when courts are called upon to decide whether to grant retroactive relief, they should distinguish the minor or technical change from the substantive change that is likely to result in discrimination. In refusing to set aside the 1976 election, the three-judge court, much to its credit, did just this.  Significantly, the Court today does not disturb that judgment, despite appellants' prayer that it do so.4\n\n\n31\nIt must be remembered that the Voting Rights Act imposes restrictions unique in the history of our country on a limited number of selected States.5  The need to bring a measure of common sense to its application is underscored further by the fact that state and local officials now are supplicants for the Attorney General's dispensation of approval under \u00a7 5 \"at the rate of over 1,000 per year, and this rate is by no means indicative of the number of submissions involved if all covered States and political units fully complied with the preclearance requirement, as interpreted by the Attorney General.\"  United States v. Sheffield Board of Comm'rs, 435 U.S. 110, 147, 98 S.Ct. 965, 987, 55 L.Ed.2d 148 (1978) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted).  When a change is submitted, the Attorney General may block its implementation simply by stating, within 60 days, that he is unable to conclude that it does not have discriminatory purpose or effect.  Georgia v. United States, 411 U.S. 526, 537, 93 S.Ct. 1702, 1709, 36 L.Ed.2d 472 (1973).  As a result, \"the State may be left more or less at sea,\" id., at 544, 93 S.Ct., at 1712 (WHITE, J., dissenting), unable to put into effect such routine and trivial changes as the movement of a polling place or a precinct boundary line.6\n\n\n32\nThus, although I agree with the Court that the three-judge court did not err in refusing to set aside the 1976 elections, I remain dubious as to whether it would be any more proper for that court to order all three posts to stand for election in 1978 if the change is not approved.  As the Court's order is framed, however, this question still is open in the District Court if the change is not approved.7  Perhaps that court will be able to perceive some distinction that is not apparent to me between setting aside the 1976 elections\u2014the denial of which relief this Court upholds\u2014and achieving essentially the same result by cutting short the terms of the two Commissioners elected in 1976 by ordering all three posts to stand for election in 1978.  Because I consider it unlikely that the three-judge court ever will have to face this question, I acquiesce in the disposition of the Court remanding \"with instructions to issue an order allowing appellees 30 days within which to apply for approval of the 1968 voting change under \u00a7 5, and for further proceedings consistent with [the Court's] opinion.\"   Ante, at 193.\n\n\n33\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Mr. Justice STEVENS joins, dissenting.\n\n\n34\nNo party to this case has requested this Court to issue an order requiring or allowing appellees to apply for approval of the 1968 voting change under \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The United States, when requested by this Court to express its views, made such a request.  But the United States is only an amicus curiae in this case, and it has no standing to request relief which has never been requested by the parties.  The opinion of the Court goes not merely beyond the scope of any relief sought from the District Court, but also decides questions beyond those presented in the jurisdictional statement of appellants.  In so doing, of course, the opinion is contrary to our Rule 15, which provides:  \"Only the questions set forth in the jurisdictional statement or fairly comprised therein will be considered by the court.\"\n\n\n35\nI would affirm the judgment of the District Court in its entirety.\n\n\n\n*\n I recognize that the case involves a voting change first implemented in 1968.  This fact does not, however, necessarily support the Court's decision.  Since the duty to comply with \u00a7 5 is a continuing one and applied to Peach County's enforcement of the 1968 change in the 1976 election, a strong argument can be made that the only relevant consideration should be that the \u00a7 5 duty was clear in 1976.\n\n\n1\n It should be noted that the amendment was enacted before this Court, by judicial interpretation, extended the coverage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, in, e. g., Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 89 S.Ct. 817, 22 L.Ed.2d 1 (1969), and Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U.S. 379, 91 S.Ct. 431, 27 L.Ed.2d 476 (1971).  Thus, when the amendment was enacted, there was no reason to suspect that \u00a7 5 preclearance was required.\n\n\n2\n In giving only prospective effect to its decision in Allen, the Court took into account the fact that \"the discriminatory purpose or effect of [the challenged] statutes, if any, has not been determined by any court.\"  393 U.S., at 572, 89 S.Ct., at 835.\n\n\n3\n In Perkins v. Matthews, supra, the Court held that, \"\u00a7 5 requires prior submission of any changes in the location of polling places.\"   Id., at 388, 91 S.Ct., at 437.  There are thousands of precincts and polling places in the jurisdictions covered by the Act, and changes in precinct boundary lines and polling places are necessary at frequent intervals to accommodate inevitable population shifts.  But under the Court's interpretation of the Act, a locality that moves a single precinct line or polling place half a block is required first to obtain permission from Washington.\n\n\n4\n The Court thus rejects Mr. Justice BRENNAN's suggestion, ante, at 193, that the District Court \"erred in refusing to order [retroactive] relief on the basis of its conclusion that the change was 'rather technical' with no 'apparent discriminatory purpose or effect.' \"  See al o Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U.S., at 572, 89 S.Ct., at 835, 22 L.Ed.2d 1 (1969), quoted in n. 2, supra;  Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U.S., at 396, 91 S.Ct., at 440.\n\n\n5\n As Mr. Justice STEVENS recently has written: \"[The] so-called 'preclearance' requirement is one of the most extraordinary remedial provisions in an Act noted for its broad remedies.  Even the Department of Justice has described it as a 'substantial departure  . . .  from ordinary concepts of our federal system';  its encroachment on state sovereignty is significant and undeniable.\"  United States v. Sheffield Board of Comm'rs, 435 U.S. 110, 141, 98 S.Ct. 965, 984, 55 L.Ed.2d 148 (1978) (dissenting opinion) (footnote omitted).  Mr. Justice Harlan made much the same point by describing \u00a7 5 as \"a revolutionary innovation in American government\" which applies only to \"a handful of States.\"  Allen v. State Board of Elections, supra, 393 U.S., at 585, 586, 89 S.Ct., at 841 (concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n\n6\n One would like to assume that the Attorney General exercises this unprecedented power to veto state and local legislation personally and with the most thoughtful deliberation. But, as previously noted, applications for his dispensation flow to Washington at a rate of over 1,000 per year\u2014almost 4 per business day.  Even if the Attorney General had no duties other than those imposed upon him by \u00a7 5, one might doubt whether it would be possible for him to pass judgment, with care and sensitivity, upon each change in election laws or procedure submitted for his approval.\n\n\n7\n The Court \"adopt[s] the suggestion of the United States that the District Court should enter an order allowing appellees 30 days within which to apply for approval of the 1968 voting change under \u00a7 5.  . . .  If approval is denied, appellants are free to renew to the District Court their request for simultaneous election of all members of the Board at the 1978 general election.\"  Ante, at 192-193.\nIt then remands the case \"to the District Court with instructions to issue an order allowing appellees 30 days within which to apply for approval of the 1968 voting change under \u00a7 5, and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\"  Ante, at 193.  But the Court does not direct the District Court to grant any \"renewed\" request that appellants may make.  All that it orders is that the District Court allow appellees 30 days within which to seek preclearance and allow appellants to \"renew\" their request for simultaneous elections in 1978 if the change is not approved.\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"383 U.S. 745\n86 S.Ct. 1170\n16 L.Ed.2d 239\nUNITED STATES, Appellant,v.Herbert GUEST et al.\nNo. 65.\nArgued Nov. 9, 1965.\nDecided March 28, 1966.\n\nSol. Gen. Thurgood Marshall, for appellant.\nCharles J. Bloch, Macon, Ga., for appellee James Spergeon Lackey.\nJames E. Hudson, Athens, Ga., for other appellees.\nMr. Justice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe six defendants in this case were indicted by a United States grand jury in the Middle District of Georgia for criminal conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241 (1964 ed.). That section provides in relevant part:\n\n\n2\n'If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress,      threaten, or intimidate any citizen in the free exercise or      enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the      Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his      having so exercised the same;\n\n\n3\n'They shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not      more than ten years, or both.'\n\n\n4\nIn five numbered paragraphs, the indictment alleged a single conspiracy by the defendants to deprive Negro citizens of the free exercise and enjoyment of several specified rights secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States.1 The defendants moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that it did not charge an offense under the laws of the United States. The District Court sustained the motion and dismissed the indictment as to all defendants and all numbered paragraphs of the indictment. 246 F.Supp. 475.\n\n\n5\nThe United States appealed directly to this Court under the Criminal Appeals Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731.2 We postponed decision of the question of our jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits. 381 U.S. 932, 85 S.Ct. 1765. It is now apparent that this Court does not have jurisdiction to decide one of the issues sought to be raised on this direct appeal. As to the other issues, however, our appellate jurisdiction is clear, and for the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the District Court. As in United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 86 S.Ct. 1152, decided today, we deal here with issues of statutory construction, not with issues of constitutional power.\n\nI.\n\n6\nThe first numbered paragraph of the indictment, reflecting a portion of the language of \u00a7 201(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000a(a) (1964 ed.), alleged that the defendants conspired to injure, oppress, threaten, and intimidate Negro citizens in the free exercise and enjoyment of:\n\n\n7\n'The right to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,      services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and      accommodations of motion picture theaters, restaurants, and      other places of public accommodation.'3\n\n\n8\nThe District Court held that this paragraph of the indictment failed to state an offense against rights secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States. The court found a fatal flaw in the failure of the paragraph to include an allegation that the acts of the defendants were motivated by racial discrimination, an allegation the court thought essential to charge an interference with rights secured by Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.4 The court went on to say that, in any event, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241 is not an available sanction to protect rights secured by that title because \u00a7 207(b) of the 1964 Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000a\u20146(b) (1964 ed.), specifies that the remedies provided in Title II itself are to be the exclusive means of enforcing the rights the title secures.5\n\n\n9\nA direct appeal to this Court is available to the United States under the Criminal Appeals Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731, from 'a decision or judgment * * * dismissing any indictment * * * or any count thereof, where such decision or judgment is based upon the * * * construction of the statute upon which the indictment * * * is founded.' In the present case, however, the District Court's judgment as to the first paragraph of the indictment was based, at least alternatively, upon its determination that this paragraph was defective as a matter of pleading. Settled principles of review under the Criminal Appeals Act therefore preclude our review of the District Court's judgment on this branch of the indictment. In United States v. Borden Co., 308 U.S. 188, 60 S.Ct. 182, 84 L.Ed. 181, Chief Justice Hughes, speaking for a unanimous Court, set out these principles with characteristic clarity:\n\n\n10\n'The established principles governing our review are these:      (1) Appeal does not lie from a judgment which rests on the      mere deficiencies of the indictment as a pleading, as distinguished from a construction of      the statute which underlies the indictment. (2) Nor will an      appeal lie in a case where the District Court has considered      the construction of the statute but has also rested its      decision upon the independent ground of a defect in pleading      which is not subject to our examination. In that case we      cannot disturb the judgment and the question of construction      becomes abstract. (3) This Court must accept the construction      given to the indictment by the District Court as that is a      matter we are not authorized to review. * * *' 308 U.S. at      193, 60 S.Ct. at 186.\n\n\n11\nSee also United States v. Swift & Co., 318 U.S. 442, 444, 63 S.Ct. 684, 685, 87 L.Ed. 889.\n\n\n12\nThe result is not changed by the circumstance that we have jurisdiction over this appeal as to the other paragraphs of the indictment. United States v. Borden, supra, involved an indictment comparable to the present one for the purposes of jurisdiction under the Criminal Appeals Act. In Borden, the District Court had held all four counts of the indictment invalid as a matter of construction of the Sherman Act, but had also held the third count defective as a matter of pleading. The Court accepted jurisdiction on direct appeal as to the first, second, and fourth counts of the indictment, but it dismissed the appeal as to the third count for want of jurisdiction. 'The Government's appeal does not open the whole case.' 308 U.S. 188, 193, 60 S.Ct. 182, 186.\n\n\n13\nIt is hardly necessary to add that our ruling as to the Court's lack of jurisdiction now to review this aspect of the case implies no opinion whatsoever as to the correctness either of the District Court's appraisal of this paragraph of the indictment as a matter of pleading or of the court's view of the preclusive effect of \u00a7 207(b) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nII.\n\n14\nThe second numbered paragraph of the indictment alleged that the defendants conspired to injure, oppress, threaten, and intimidate Negro citizens of the United States in the free exercise and enjoyment of:\n\n\n15\n'The right to the equal utilization, without discrimination      upon the basis of race, of public facilities in the vicinity      of Athens, Georgia, owned, operated or managed by or on      behalf of the State of Georgia or any subdivision thereof.'\n\n\n16\nCorrectly characterizing this paragraph as embracing rights protected by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the District Court held as a matter of statutory construction that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241 does not encompass any Fourteenth Amendment rights, and further held as a matter of constitutional law that 'any broader construction of \u00a7 241 * * * would render it void for indefiniteness.' 246 F.Supp., at 486. In so holding, the District Court was in error, as our opinion in United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 86 S.Ct. 1152, decided today, makes abundantly clear.\n\n\n17\nTo be sure, Price involves rights under the Due Process Clause, whereas the present case involves rights under the Equal Protection Clause. But no possible reason suggests itself for concluding that \u00a7 241\u2014if it protects Fourteenth Amendment rights protects rights secured by the one Clause but not those secured by the other. We have made clear in Price that when \u00a7 241 speaks of 'any right or privilege secured * * * by the Constitution or laws of the United States,' it means precisely that.\n\n\n18\nMoreover, inclusion of Fourteenth Amendment rights within the compass of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241 does not render the statute unconstitutionally vague. Since the gravamen of the offense is conspiracy, the requirement that the offender must act with a specific intent to interfere with the federal rights in question is satisfied. Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495; United States v. Williams, 341 U.S. 70, 93\u201495, 71 S.Ct. 581, 593\u2014595, 95 L.Ed. 758 (dissenting opinion). And the rights under the Equal Protection Clause described by this paragraph of the indictment have been so firmly and precisely established by a consistent line of decisions in this Court,6 that the lack of specification of these rights in the language of \u00a7 241 itself can raise no serious constitutional question on the ground of vagueness or indefiniteness.\n\n\n19\nUnlike the indictment in Price, however, the indictment in the present case names no person alleged to have acted in any way under the color of state law. The argument is therefore made that, since there exist no Equal Protection Clause rights against wholly private action, the judgment of the District Court on this branch of the case must be affirmed. On its face, the argument is unexceptionable. The Equal Protection Clause speaks to the State or to those acting under the color of its authority.7\n\n\n20\nIn this connection, we emphasize that \u00a7 241 by its clear language incorporates no more than the Equal Protection Clause itself; the statute does not purport to give substantive, as opposed to remedial, implementation to any rights secured by that Clause.8 Since we therefore deal here only with the bare terms of the Equal Protection Clause itself, nothing said in this opinion goes to the question of what kinds of other and broader legislation Congress might constitutionally enact under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to implement that Clause or any other provision of the Amendment.9\n\n\n21\nIt is a commonplace that rights under the Equal Protection Clause itself arise only where there has been involvement of the State or of one acting under the color of its authority. The Equal Protection Clause 'does not * * * add any thing to the rights which one citizen has under the Constitution against another.' United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 554\u2014555, 23 L.Ed. 588. As Mr. Justice Douglas more recently put it, 'The Fourteenth Amendment protects the individual against state action, not against wrongs done by individuals.' United States v. Williams, 341 U.S. 70, 92, 71 S.Ct. 581, 593, 95 L.Ed. 758 (dissenting opinion). This has been the view of the Court from the beginning. United States v. Cruikshank, supra; United States v. Harris, 106 U.S. 629, 1 S.Ct. 601, 27 L.Ed. 290; Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 3 S.Ct. 18, 27 L.Ed. 835; Hodges v. United States, 203 U.S. 1, 27 S.Ct. 6, 51 L.Ed. 65; United States v. Powell, 212 U.S. 564, 29 S.Ct. 690, 53 L.Ed. 653. It remains the Court's view today. See, e.g., Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296, 86 S.Ct. 486, 15 L.Ed.2d 373; United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 86 S.Ct. 1152.\n\n\n22\nThis is not to say, however, that the involvement of the State need be either exclusive or direct. In a variety of situations the Court has found state action of a nature sufficient to create rights under the Equal Protection Clause even though the participation of the State was peripheral, or its action was only one of several co-operative forces leading to the constitutional violation. See, e.g., Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 68 S.Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. 1161; Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Board of Directors of City Trusts of City of Philadelphia, 353 U.S. 230, 77 S.Ct. 806, 1 L.Ed.2d 792; Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45; Peterson v. City of Greenville, 373 U.S. 244, 83 S.Ct. 1119, 10 L.Ed.2d 323; Lombard v. State of Louisiana, 373 U.S. 267, 83 S.Ct. 1122, 10 L.Ed.2d 338; Griffin v. State of Maryland, 378 U.S. 130, 84 S.Ct. 1770, 12 L.Ed.2d 754; Robinson v. State of Florida, 378 U.S. 153, 84 S.Ct. 1693, 12 L.Ed.2d 771; Evans v. Newton, supra.\n\n\n23\nThis case, however, requires no determination of the threshold level that state action must attain in order to create rights under the Equal Protection Clause. This is so because, contrary to the argument of the litigants, the indictment in fact contains an express allegation of state involvement sufficient at least to require the denial of a motion to dismiss. One of the means of accomplishing the object of the conspiracy, according to the indictment, was 'By causing the arrest of Negroes by means of false reports that such Negroes had committed criminal acts.'10 In Bell v. State of Maryland, 378 U.S. 226, 84 S.Ct. 1814, 12 L.Ed.2d 822, three members of the Court expressed the view that a private businessman's invocation of state police and judicial action to carry out his own policy of racial discrimination was sufficient to create Equal Protection Clause rights in those against whom the racial discrimination was directed.11 Three other members of the Court strongly disagreed with that view,12 and three expressed no opinion on the question. The allegation of the extent of official involvement in the present case is not clear. It may charge no more than co-operative private and state action similar to that involved in Bell, but it may go considerably further. For example, the allegation is broad enough to cover a charge of active connivance by agents of the State in the making of the 'false reports,' or other conduct amounting to official discrimination clearly sufficient to constitute denial of rights protected by the Equal Protection Clause. Although it is possible that a bill of particulars, or the proof if the case goes to trial, would disclose no co-operative action of that kind by officials of the State, the allegation in enough to prevent dismissal of this branch of the indictment.\n\nIII.\n\n24\nThe fourth numbered paragraph of the indictment alleged that the defendants conspired to injure, oppress, threaten, and intimidate Negro citizens of the United States in the free exercise and enjoyment of:\n\n\n25\n'The right to travel freely to and from the State of Georgia      and to use highway facilities and other instrumentalities of      interstate commerce within the State of Georgia.'13\n\n\n26\nThe District Court was in error in dismissing the indictment as to this paragraph. The constitutional right to travel from one State to another, and necessarily to use the highways and other instrumentalities of interstate commerce in doing so, occupies a position fundamental to the concept of our Federal Union. It is a right that has been firmly established and repeatedly recognized. In Crandall v. State of Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, 18 L.Ed. 744, invalidating a Nevada tax on every person leaving the State by common carrier, the Court took as its guide the statement of Chief Justice Taney in the Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283, 492:\n\n\n27\n'For all the great purposes for which the Federal government      was formed, we are one people, with one common country. We      are all citizens of the United States; and, as members of the      same community, must have the right to pass and repass      through every part of it without interruption, as freely as      in our own States.'\n\n\n28\nSee 6 Wall., at 48\u201449.\n\n\n29\nAlthough the Articles of Confederation provided that 'the people of each State shall have free ingress and regress to and from any other State,'14 that right finds no explicit mention in the Constitution. The reason, it has been suggested, is that a right so elementary was conceived from the beginning to be a necessary concomitant of the stronger Union the Constitution created.15 In any event, freedom to travel throughout the United States has long been recognized as a basic right under the Constitution. See Williams v. Fears, 179 U.S. 270, 274, 21 S.Ct. 128, 129, 45 L.Ed. 186; Twining v. State of New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78, 97, 29 S.Ct. 14, 18, 53 L.Ed. 97; Edwards v. People of State of California, 314 U.S. 160, 177, 62 S.Ct. 164, 168, 86 L.Ed. 119 (concurring opinion), 181, 62 S.Ct. 170 (concurring opinion); People of State of New York v. O'Neill, 359 U.S. 1, 6\u20148; 12\u201416, 79 S.Ct. 564, 568\u2014570; 571\u2014574, 3 L.Ed.2d 585 (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n30\nIn Edwards v. People of State of California, 314 U.S. 160, 62 S.Ct. 164, 86 L.Ed. 119, invalidating a California law which impeded the free interstate passage of the indigent, the Court based its reaffirmation of the federal right of interstate travel upon the Commerce Clause. This ground of decision was consistent with precedents firmly establishing that the federal commerce power surely encompasses the movement in interstate commerce of persons as well as commodities. Gloucester Ferry Co. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 114 U.S. 196, 203, 5 S.Ct. 826, 827, 29 L.Ed. 158; Covington & Cincinnati Bridge Co. v. Commonwealth of Kentucky, 154 U.S. 204, 218\u2014219, 14 S.Ct. 1087, 1092, 38 L.Ed. 962; Hoke v. United States, 227 U.S. 308, 320, 33 S.Ct. 281, 283, 57 L.Ed. 523; United States v. Hill, 248 U.S. 420, 423, 39 S.Ct. 143, 144, 63 L.Ed. 337. It is also well settled in our decisions that the federal commerce power authorizes Congress to legislate for the protection of individuals from violations of civil rights that impinge on their free movement in interstate commerce. Mitchell v. United States, 313 U.S. 80, 61 S.Ct. 873, 85 L.Ed. 1201; Henderson v. United States, 339 U.S. 816, 70 S.Ct. 843, 94 L.Ed. 1302; Boynton v. Commonwealth of Virginia, 364 U.S. 454, 81 S.Ct. 182, 5 L.Ed.2d 206; Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 85 S.Ct. 348, 13 L.Ed.2d 258; Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294, 85 S.Ct. 377, 13 L.Ed.2d 290.\n\n\n31\nAlthough there have been recurring differences in emphasis within the Court as to the source of the constitutional right of interstate travel, there is no need here to canvass those differences further.16 All have agreed that the right exists. Its explicit recognition as one of the federal rights protected by what is now 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241 goes back at least as far as 1904. United States v. Moore, C.C., 129 F. 630, 633. We reaffirm it now.17\n\n\n32\nThis does not mean, of course, that every criminal conspiracy affecting an individual's right of free interstate passage is within the sanction of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241. A specific intent to interfere with the Federal right must be proved, and at a trial the defendants are entitled to a jury instruction phrased in those terms. Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 106\u2014107, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 1037\u20141038, 89 L.Ed. 1495. Thus, for example, a conspiracy to rob an interstate traveler would not, of itself, violate \u00a7 241. But if the predominant purpose of the conspiracy is to impede or prevent the exercise of the right of interstate travel, or to oppress a person because of his exercise of that right, then, whether or not motivated by racial discrimination, the conspiracy becomes a proper object of the federal law under which the indictment in this case was brought. Accordingly, it was error to grant the motion to dismiss on this branch of the indictment.\n\n\n33\nFor these reasons, the judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n\n\n34\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n35\nMr. Justice CLARK, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice FORTAS join, concurring.\n\n\n36\nI join the opinion of the Court in this case but believe it worthwhile to comment on its Part II in which the Court discusses that portion of the indictment charging the appellees with conspiring to injure, oppress, threaten and intimidate Negro citizens of the United States in the free exercise and enjoyment of:\n\n\n37\n'The right to the equal utilization, without discrimination      upon the basis of race, of public facilities in the vicinity      of Athens, Georgia, owned, operated or managed by or on      behalf of the State of Georgia or any subdivision thereof.'\n\n\n38\nThe appellees contend that the indictment is invalid since 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241, under which it was returned, protects only against interference with the exercise of the right to equal utilization of state facilities, which is not a right 'secured' by the Fourteenth Amendment in the absence of state action. With respect to this contention the Court upholds the indictment on the ground that it alleges the conspiracy was accomplished, in part, '(b)y causing the arrest of Negroes by means of false reports that such Negroes had committed criminal acts.' The Court reasons that this allegation of the indictment might well cover active connivance by agents of the State in the making of these false reports or in carrying on other conduct amounting to official discrimination. By so construing the indictment, it finds the language sufficient to cover a denial of rights protected by the Equal Protection Clause. The Court thus removes from the case any necessity for a 'determination of the threshold level that state action must attain in order to create rights under the Equal Protection Clause.' A study of the language in the indictment clearly shows that the Court's construction is not a capricious one, and I therefore agree with that construction, as well as the conclusion that follows.\n\n\n39\nThe Court carves out of its opinion the question of the power of Congress, under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, to enact legislation implementing the Equal Protection Clause or any other provision of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court's interpretation of the indictment clearly avoids the question whether Congress, by appropriate legislation, has the power to punish private conspiracies that interfere with Fourteenth Amendment rights, such as the right to utilize public facilities. My Brother BRENNAN, however, says that the Court's disposition constitutes an acceptance of appellees' aforesaid contention as to \u00a7 241. Some of his language further suggests that the Court indicates sub silentio that Congress does not have the power to outlaw such conspiracies. Although the Court specifically rejects any such connotation, ante, p. 755, it is, I believe, both appropriate and necessary under the circumstances here to say that there now can be no doubt that the specific language of \u00a7 5 empowers the Congress to enact laws punishing all conspiracies\u2014with or without state action\u2014that interfere with Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\n\n40\nMr. Justice HARLAN, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\n41\nI join Parts I and II1 of the Court's opinion, but I cannot subscribe to Part III in its full sweep. To the extent that it is there held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241 (1964 ed.) reaches conspiracies, embracing only the action of private persons, to obstruct or otherwise interfere with the right of citizens freely to engage in interstate travel, I am constrained to dissent. On the other hand, I agree that \u00a7 241 does embrace state interference with such interstate travel, and I therefore consider that this aspect of the indictment is sustainable on the reasoning of Part II of the Court's opinion.\n\n\n42\nThis right to travel must be found in the Constitution itself. This is so because \u00a7 241 covers only conspiracies to interfere with any citizen in the 'free exercise or enjoyment' of a right or privilege 'secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States,' and no 'right to travel' can be found in \u00a7 241 or in any other law of the United States. My disagreement with this phase of the Court's opinion lies in this: While past cases do indeed establish that there is a constitutional 'right to travel' between States free from unreasonable governmental interference, today's decision is the first to hold that such movement is also protected against private interference, and, depending on the constitutional source of the right, I think it either unwise or impermissible so to read the Constitution.\n\n\n43\nPreliminarily, nothing in the Constitution expressly secures the right to travel. In contract the Articles of Confederation provided in Art. IV:\n\n\n44\n'The better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and      intercourse among the people of the different States in this      Union, the free inhabitants of each of these States * * *      shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free      citizens in the several States; and the people of each State      shall have free ingress and regress to and from any other      State, and shall enjoy therein all the privileges of trade      and commerce, subject to the same duties, impositions and      restrictions as the inhabitants thereof respectively * * *.' This right to 'free ingress and regress' was eliminated from the draft of the Constitution without discussion even though the main objective of the Convention was to create a stronger union. It has been assumed that the clause was dropped because it was so obviously an essential part of our federal structure that it was necessarily subsumed under more general clauses of the Constitution. See United States v. Wheeler, 254 U.S. 281, 294, 41 S.Ct. 133, 134, 65 L.Ed. 270. I propose to examine the several asserted constitutional bases for the right to travel, and the scope of its protection in relation to each source.\n\nI.\n\n45\nBecause of the close proximity of the right of ingress and regress to the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Articles of Confederation it has long been declared that the right is a privilege and immunity of national citizenship under the Constitution. In the influential opinion of Mr. Justice Washington on circuit, Corfield v. Coryell, Fed.Cas.No. 3,230, 4 Wash.C.C. 371 (1825), the court addressed itself to the question\u2014'what are the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states?' Id., at 380. Corfield was concerned with a New Jersey statute restricting to state citizens the right to rake for oysters, a statute which the court upheld. In analyzing the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Constitution, Art. IV, \u00a7 2, the court stated that it confined 'these expressions to those privileges and immunities which are, in their nature, fundamental,' and listed among them 'The right of a citizen of one state to pass through, or to reside in any other state, for purposes of trade, agriculture, professional pursuits, or otherwise * * *.' Id., at 380\u2014381.\n\n\n46\nThe dictum in Corfield was given general approval in the first opinion of this Court to deal directly with the right of free movement, Crandall v. State of Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, 18 L.Ed. 744, which struck down a Nevada statute taxing persons leaving the State. It is first noteworthy that in his concurring opinion Mr. Justice Clifford asserted that he would hold the statute void exclusively on commerce grounds for he was clear 'that the State legislature cannot impose any such burden upon commerce among the several States.' 6 Wall., at 49. The majority opinion of Mr. Justice Miller, however, eschewed reliance on the Commerce Clause and the Import-Export Clause and looked rather to the nature of the federal union:\n\n\n47\n'The people of these United States constitute one nation. * *      * This government has necessarily a capital established by      law * * *. That government has a right to call to this point      any or all of its citizens to aid in its service * * *. The      government, also, has its offices of secondary importance in      all other parts of the country. On the sea-coasts and on the      rivers it has its ports of entry. In the interior it has its      land offices, its revenue offices, and its sub-treasuries. In      all these it demands the services of its citizens, and is      entitled to bring them to those points from all quarters of      the nation, and no power can exist in a State to obstruct      this right that would not enable it to defeat the purposes      for which the government was established.' 6 Wall., at 43\u201444.\n\n\n48\nAccompanying this need of the Federal Government, the Court found a correlative right of the citizen to move unimpeded throughout the land:\n\n\n49\n'He has the right to come to the seat of government to assert      any claim he may have upon that government, or to transact      any business he may have with it. To seek its protection, to      share its offices, to engage in administering its functions.      He has a right to free access to its sea-ports, through which      all the operations of foreign trade and commerce are conducted, to the sub-treasuries, the land offices, the      revenue offices, and the courts of justice in the several      States, and this right is in its nature independent of the      will of any State over whose soil he must pass in the      exercise of it.' 6 Wall., at 44.\n\n\n50\nThe focus of that opinion, very clearly, was thus on impediments by the States on free movement by citizens. This is emphasized subsequently when Mr. Justice Miller asserts that this approach is 'neither novel nor unsupported by authority,' because it is, fundamentally, a question of the exercise of a State's taxing power to obstruct the functions of the Federal Government: '(T) he right of the States in this mode to impede or embarrass the constitutional operations of that government, or the rights which its citizens hold under it, has been uniformly denied.' 6 Wall., at 44\u201445.\n\n\n51\nLater cases, alluding to privileges and immunities, have in dicta included the right to free movement. See Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 180, 19 L.Ed. 357; Williams v. Fears, 179 U.S. 270, 274, 21 S.Ct. 128, 129, 45 L.Ed. 186; Twining v. State of New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78, 29 S.Ct. 14, 53 L.Ed. 97.\n\n\n52\nAlthough the right to travel thus has respectable precedent to support its status as a privilege and immunity of national citizenship, it is important to note that those cases all dealt with the right of travel simply as affected by oppressive state action. Only one prior case in this Court, United States v. Wheeler, 254 U.S. 281, 41 S.Ct. 133, 65 L.Ed. 270, was argued precisely in terms of a right to free movement as against interference by private individuals. There the Government alleged a conspiracy under the predecessor of \u00a7 241 against the perpetrators of the notorious Bisbee Deportations.2 The case was argued straightforwardly in terms of whether the right to free ingress and egress, admitted by both parties to be a right of national citizenship, was constitutionally guaranteed against private conspiracies. The Brief for the Defendants in Error, whose counsel was Charles Evans Hughes, later Chief Justice of the United States, gives as one of its main points: 'So far as there is a right pertaining to Federal citizenship to have free ingress or egress with respect to the several States, the right as essentially one of protection against the action of the States themselves and of those acting under their authority.' Brief, at p.i. The Court, with one dissent, accepted this interpretation of the right of unrestricted interstate movement, observing that Crandall v. State of Nevada, supra, was inapplicable because, inter alia, it dealt with state action. 254 U.S. at 299, 41 S.Ct. at 136. More recent cases discussing or applying the right to interstate travel have always been in the context of oppressive state action. See, e.g., Edwards v. People of State of California, 314 U.S. 160, 62 S.Ct. 164, 86 L.Ed. 119, and other cases discussed, infra.3\n\n\n53\nIt is accordingly apparent that the right to unimpeded interstate travel, regarded as a privilege and immunity of national citizenship, was historically seen as a method of breaking down state provincialism, and facilitating the creation of a true federal union. In the one case in which a private conspiracy to obstruct such movement was heretofore presented to this Court, the predecessor of the very statute we apply today was held not to encompass such a right.\n\nII.\n\n54\nA second possible constitutional basis for the right to move among the States without interference is the Commerce Clause. When Mr. Justice Washington articulated the right in Corfield, it was in the context of a state statute impeding economic activity by outsiders, and he cast his statement in economic terms. 4 Wash.C.C., at 380\u2014381. The two concurring Justices in Crandall v. State of Nevada, supra, rested solely on the commerce argument, indicating again the close connection between freedom of commerce and travel as principles of our federal union. In Edwards v. People of State of California, 314 U.S. 160, 62 S.Ct. 164, 86 L.Ed. 119, the Court held squarely that the right to unimpeded movement of persons is guaranteed against oppressive state legislation by the Commerce Clause, and declared unconstitutional a California statute restricting the entry of indigents into that State.\n\n\n55\nApplication of the Commerce Clause to this area has the advantage of supplying a longer tradition of case law and more refined principles of adjudication. States do have rights of taxation and quarantine, see Edwards v. People of State of California, 314 U.S. at 184 (concurring opinion), 62 S.Ct. at 171 172, which just be weighed against the general right of free movement, and Commerce Clause adjudication has traditionally been the means of reconciling these interests. Yet this approach to the right to travel, like that found in the privileges and immunities cases, is concerned with the interrelation of state and federal power, not\u2014with an exception to be dealt with in a moment\u2014with private interference.\n\n\n56\nThe case of In re Debs, 158 U.S. 564, 15 S.Ct. 900, 39 L.Ed. 1092, may be thought to raise some doubts as to this proposition. There the United States sought to enjoin Debs and members of his union from continuing to obstruct\u2014by means of a strike\u2014interstate commerce and the passage of the mails. The Court held that Congress and the Executive could certainly act to keep the channels of interstate commerce open, and that a court of equity had no less power to enjoin what amounted to a public nuisance. It might be argued that to the extent Debs permits the Federal Government to obtain an injunction against the private conspiracy alleged in the present indictment,4 the criminal statute should be applicable as well on the ground that the governmental interest in both cases is the same namely to vindicate the underlying policy of the Commerce Clause. However, \u00a7 241 is not directed toward the vindication of governmental interests; it requires a private right under federal law. No such right can be found in Debs, which stands simply for the proposition that the Commerce Clause gives the Federal Government standing to sue on a basis similar to that of private individuals under nuisance law. The substantive rights of private persons to enjoin such impediments, of course, devolve from state not federal law; any seemingly inconsistent discussion in Debs would appear substantially vitiated by Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188.\n\n\n57\nI cannot find in any of this past case law any solid support for a conclusion that the Commerce Clause embraces a right to be free from private interference. And the Court's opinion here makes no such suggestion.\n\nIII.\n\n58\nOne other possible source for the right to travel should be mentioned. Professor Chafee, in his thoughtful study, 'Freedom of Movement,'5 finds both the privileges and immunities approach and the Commerce Clause approach unsatisfactory. After a thorough review of the history and cases dealing with the question he concludes that this 'valuable human right,' id., at 209, is best seen in due process terms:\n\n\n59\n'Already in several decisions the Court has used the Due      Process Clause to safeguard the right of the members of any      race to reside where they please inside a state, regardless      of ordinances and injunctions. Why is not this clause equally      available to assure the right to live in any state one      desires? And unreasonable restraints by the national      government on mobility can be upset by the Due Process Clause      in the Fifth Amendment * * *. Thus the 'liberty' of all human      beings which cannot be taken away without due process of law      includes liberty of speech, press, assembly, religion, and      also liberty of movement.' Id., at 192\u2014193.\n\n\n60\nThis due process approach to the right to unimpeded movement has been endorsed by this Court. In Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116, 78 S.Ct. 1113, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204, the Court asserted that 'The right to travel is a part of the 'liberty' of which the citizen cannot be deprived without the due process of law under the Fifth Amendment,' id., at 125, 78 S.Ct. at 1118, citing Crandall v. State of Nevada, supra, and Edwards v. People of State of California, supra. It is true that the holding in that case turned essentially on statutory grounds. However, in Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U.S. 500, 84 S.Ct. 1659, 12 L.Ed.2d 992, the Court, applying this constitutional doctrine, struck down a federal statute forbidding members of Communist organizations to obtain passports. Both the majority and dissenting opinions affirmed the principle that the right to travel is an aspect of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause.\n\n\n61\nViewing the right to travel in due process terms, of course, would clearly make it inapplicable to the present case, for due process speaks only to governmental action.\n\nIV.\n\n62\nThis survey of the various bases for grounding the 'right to travel' is conclusive only to the extent of showing that there has never been an acknowledged constitutional right to be free from private interference, and that the right in question has traditionally been seen and applied, whatever the constitutional underpinning asserted, only against governmental impediments. The right involved being as nebulous as it is, however, it is necessary to consider it in terms of policy as well as precedent.\n\n\n63\nAs a general proposition it seems to me very dubious that the Constitution was intended to create certain rights of private individuals as against other private individuals. The Constitutional Convention was called to establish a nation, not to reform the common law. Even the Bill of Rights, designed to protect personal liberties, was directed at rights against governmental authority, not other individuals. It is true that there is a very narrow range of rights against individuals which have been read into the Constitution. In Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651, 4 S.Ct. 152, 28 L.Ed. 274, the Court held that implicit in the Constitution is the right of citizens to be free of private interference in federal elections. United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 85 L.Ed. 1368, extended this coverage to primaries. Logan v. United States, 144 U.S. 263, 12 S.Ct. 617, 36 L.Ed. 429, applied the predecessor of \u00a7 241 to a conspiracy to injure someone in the custody of a United States marshal; the case has been read as dealing with a privilege and immunity of citizenship, but it would seem to have depended as well on extrapolations from statutory provisions providing for supervision of prisoners. The Court in In re Quarles, 158 U.S. 532, 15 S.Ct. 959, 39 L.Ed. 1080, extending Logan, supra, declared that there was a right of federal citizenship to inform federal officials of violations of federal law. See also United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 552, 23 L.Ed. 588, which announced in dicta a federal right to assemble to petition the Congress for a redress of grievances.\n\n\n64\nWhatever the validity of these cases on their own terms, they are hardly persuasive authorities for adding to the collection of privileges and immunities the right to be free of private impediments to travel. The cases just discussed are narrow, and are essentially concerned with the vindication of important relationships with the Federal Government\u2014voting in federal elections, involvement in federal law enforcement, communicating with the Federal Government. The present case stands on a considerably different footing.\n\n\n65\nIt is arguable that the same considerations which led the Court on numerous occasions to find a right of free movement against oppressive state action now justify a similar result with respect to private impediments. Crandall v. State of Nevada, supra, spoke of the need to travel to the capital, to serve and consult with the offices of government. A basic reason for the formation of this Nation was to facilitate commercial intercourse; intellectual, cultural, scientific, social, and political interests are likewise served by free movement. Surely these interests can be impeded by private vigilantes as well as by state action. Although this argument is not without force, I do not think it is particularly persuasive. There is a difference in power between States and private groups so great that analogies between the two tend to be misleading. If the State obstructs free intercourse of goods, people, or ideas, the bonds of the union are threatened; if a private group effectively stops such communication, there is at most a temporary breakdown of law and order, to be remedied by the exercise of state authority or by appropriate federal legislation.\n\n\n66\nTo decline to find a constitutional right of the nature asserted here does not render the Federal Government helpless. As to interstate commerce by railroads, federal law already provides remedies for 'undue or unreasonable prejudice,' 24 Stat. 380, as amended, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 3(1) (1964 ed.), which has been held to apply to racial discrimination. Henderson v. United States, 339 U.S. 816, 70 S.Ct. 843, 94 L.Ed. 1302. A similar statute applies to motor carriers, 49 Stat. 558, as amended, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 316(d) (1964 ed.), and to air carriers, 72 Stat. 760, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1374(b) (1964 ed.). See Boynton v. Commonwealth of Virginia, 364 U.S. 454, 81 S.Ct. 182, 5 L.Ed.2d 206; Fitzgerald v. Pan American World Airways, 2 Cir., 229 F.2d 499. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 243, deals with other types of obstructions to interstate commerce. Indeed, under the Court's present holding, it is arguable that any conspiracy to discriminate in public accommodations having the effect of impeding interstate commerce could be reached under \u00a7 241, unaided by Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Because Congress has wide authority to legislate in this area, it seems unnecessary\u2014if prudential grounds are of any relevance, see Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 258\u2014259, 82 S.Ct. 691, 732\u2014733, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (Clark J., concurring)\u2014to strain to find a dubious constitutional right.\n\nV.\n\n67\nIf I have succeeded in showing anything in this constitutional exercise, it is that until today there was no federal right to be free from private interference with interstate transit, and very little reason for creating one. Although the Court has ostensibly only 'discovered' this private right in the Constitution and then applied \u00a7 241 mechanically to punish those who conspire to threaten it, it should be recognized that what the Court has in effect done is to use this all-encompassing criminal statute to fashion federal common-law crimes, forbidden to the federal judiciary since the 1812 decision in United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 3 L.Ed. 259. My Brother Douglas, dissenting in United States v. Classic, supra, noted well the dangers of the indiscriminate application of the predecessor of \u00a7 241: 'It is not enough for us to find in the vague penumbra of a statute some offense about which Congress could have legislated and then to particularize it as a crime because it is highly offensive.' 313 U.S. at 331\u2014332, 61 S.Ct. at 1045, 85 L.Ed. 1368.\n\n\n68\nI do not gainsay that the immunities and commerce provisions of the Constitution leave the way open for the finding of this 'private' constitutional right, since they do not speak solely in terms of governmental action. Nevertheless, I think it wrong to sustain a criminal indictment on such an uncertain ground. To do so subjects \u00a7 241 to serious challenge on the score of vagueness and serves in effect to place this Court in the position of making criminal law under the name of constitutional interpretation. It is difficult to subdue misgivings about the potentialities of this decision.\n\n\n69\nI would sustain this aspect of the indictment only on the premise that it sufficiently alleges state interference with interstate travel, and on no other ground.\n\n\n70\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\n71\nI join Part I of the Court's opinion. I reach the same result as the Court on that branch of the indictment discussed in Part III of its opinion but for other reasons. See footnote 3, infra. And I agree with so much of Part II as construes 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241 (1964 ed.) to encompass conspiracies to injure, oppress, threaten or intimidate citizens in the free exercise or enjoyment of Fourteenth Amendment rights and holds that, as so construed, \u00a7 241 is not void for indefiniteness. I do not agree, however, with the remainder of Part II which holds, as I read the opinion, that a conspiracy to interfere with the exercise of the right to equal utilization of state facilities is not, within the meaning of \u00a7 241, a conspiracy to interfere with the exercise of a 'right * * * secured * * * by the Constitution' unless discriminatory conduct by state officers is involved in the alleged conspiracy.\n\nI.\n\n72\nThe second numbered paragraph of the indictment charges that the defendants conspired to injure, oppress, threaten, and intimidate Negro citizens in the free exercise and enjoyment of '(t)he right to the equal utilization, without discrimination upon the basis of race, of public facilities * * * owned, operated or managed by or on behalf of the State of Georgia or any subdivision thereof.' Appellees contend that as a matter of statutory construction \u00a7 241 does not reach such a conspiracy. They argue that a private conspiracy to interfere with the exercise of the right to equal utilization of the state facilities described in that paragraph is not, within the meaning of \u00a7 241, a conspiracy to interfere with the exercise of a right 'secured' by the Fourteenth Amendment because 'there exist no Equal Protection Clause rights against wholly private action.'\n\n\n73\nThe Court deals with this contention by seizing upon an allegation in the indictment concerning one of the means employed by the defendants to achieve the object of the conspiracy. The indictment alleges that the object of the conspiracy was to be achieved, in part, '(b)y causing the arrest of Negroes by means of false reports that such Negroes had committed criminal acts * * *.' The Court reads this allegation as 'broad enough to cover a charge of active connivance by agents of the State in the making of the 'false reports,' or other conduct amounting to official discrimination clearly sufficient to constitute denial of rights protected by the Equal Protection Clause,' and the Court holds that this allegation, so construed, is sufficient to 'prevent dismissal of this branch of the indictment.'1 I understand this to mean that, no matter how compelling the proof that private conspirators murdered, assaulted, or intimidated Negroes in order to prevent their use of state facilities, the prosecution under the second numbered paragraph must fail in the absence of proof of active connivance of law enforcement officers with the private conspirators in causing the false arrests.\n\n\n74\nHence, while the order dismissing the second numbered paragraph of the indictment is reversed, severe limitations on the prosecution of that branch of the indictment are implicitly imposed. These limitations could only stem from an acceptance of appellees' contention that, because there exist no Equal Protection Clause rights against wholly private action, a conspiracy of private persons to interfere with the right to equal utilization of state facilities described in the second numbered paragraph is not a conspiracy to interfere with a 'right * * * secured * * * by the Constitution' within the meaning of \u00a7 241. In other words, in the Court's view the only right referred to in the second numbered paragraph that is, for purposes of \u00a7 241, 'secured * * * by the Constitution' is a right to be free\u2014when seeking access to state facilities\u2014from discriminatory conduct by state officers or by persons acting in concert with state officers.2\n\n\n75\nI cannot agree with that construction of \u00a7 241. I am of the opinion that a conspiracy to interfere with the right to equal utilization of state facilities described in the second numbered paragraph of the indictment is a conspiracy to interfere with a 'right * * * secured * * * by the Constitution' within the meaning of \u00a7 241\u2014without regard to whether state officers participated in the alleged conspiracy. I believe that \u00a7 241 reaches such a private conspiracy, not because the Fourteenth Amendment of its own force prohibits such a conspiracy, but because \u00a7 241, as an exercise of congressional power under \u00a7 5 of that Amendment, prohibits all conspiracies to interfere with the exercise of a 'right * * * secured * * * by the Constitution' and because the right to equal utilization of state facilities is a 'right * * * secured * * * by the Constitution' within the meaning of that phrase as used in \u00a7 241.3\n\n\n76\nMy difference with the Court stems from its construction of the term 'secured' as used in \u00a7 241 in the phrase a 'right * * * secured * * * by the Constitution or laws of the United States.' The Court tacitly construes the term 'secured' so as to restrict the coverage of \u00a7 241 to those rights that are 'fully protected' by the Constitution or another federal law. Unless private interferences with the exercise of the right in question are prohibited by the Constitution itself or another federal law, the right cannot, in the Court's view, be deemed 'secured * * * by the Constitution or laws of the United States' so as to make \u00a7 241 applicable to a private conspiracy to interfere with the exercise of that right. The Court then premises that neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor any other federal law4 prohibits private interferences with the exercise of the right to equal utilization of state facilities.\n\n\n77\nIn my view, however, a right can be deemed 'secured * * * by the Constitution or laws of the United States,' within the meaning of \u00a7 241, even though only governmental interferences with the exercise of the right are prohibited by the Constitution itself (or another federal law). The term 'secured' means 'created by, arising under, or dependent upon,' Logan v. United States, 144 U.S. 263, 293, 12 S.Ct. 617, 626, 36 L.Ed. 429, rather than 'fully protected.' A right is 'secured * * * by the Constitution' within the meaning of \u00a7 241 if it emanates from the Constitution, if it finds its source in the Constitution. Section 241 must thus be viewed, in this context, as an exercise of congressional power to amplify prohibitions of the Constitution addressed, as is invariably the case, to government officers; contrary to the view of the Court, I think we are dealing here with a statute that seeks to implement the Constitution, not with the 'bare terms' of the Constitution. Section 241 is not confined to protecting rights against private conspiracies that the Constitution or another federal law also protects against private interferences. No such duplicative function was envisioned in its enactment. See Appendix in United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 807, 86 S.Ct. 1163. Nor has this Court construed \u00a7 241 in such a restrictive manner in other contexts. Many of the rights that have been held to be encompassed within \u00a7 241 are not additionally the subject of protection of specific federal legislation or of any provision of the Constitution addressed to private individuals. For example, the prohibitions and remedies of \u00a7 241 have been declared to apply, without regard to whether the alleged violator was a government officer, to interferences with the right to vote in a federal election, Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651, 4 S.Ct. 152, 28 L.Ed. 274, or primary, United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 85 L.Ed. 1368; the right to discuss public affairs or petition for redress of grievances, United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 552, 23 L.Ed. 588, cf. Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496, 512\u2014513, 59 S.Ct. 954, 962\u2014963, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (opinion of Roberts, J.); Collins v. Hardyman, 341 U.S. 651, 663, 71 S.Ct. 937, 942, 96 L.Ed. 1253 (dissenting opinion); the right to be protected against violence while in the lawful custody of a federal officer, Logan v. United States, 144 U.S. 263, 12 S.Ct. 617, 36 L.Ed. 429; and the right to inform of violations of federal law, In re Quarles and Butler, 158 U.S. 532, 15 S.Ct. 959, 39 L.Ed. 1080. The full import of our decision in United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, at pp. 796\u2014807, 86 S.Ct. 1152, at pp. 1158 1163, regarding \u00a7 241 is to treat the rights purportedly arising from the Fourteenth Amendment in parity with those rights just enumerated, arising from other constitutional provisions. The reach of \u00a7 241 should not vary with the particular constitutional provision that is the source of the right. For purposes of applying \u00a7 241 to a private conspiracy, the standard used to determine whether, for example, the right to discuss public affairs or the right to vote in a federal election is a 'right * * * secured * * * by the Constitution' is the very same standard to be used to determine whether the right to equal utilization of state facilities is a 'right * * * secured * * * by the Constitution.'\n\n\n78\nFor me, the right to use state facilities without discrimination on the basis of race is, within the meaning of \u00a7 241, a right created by, arising under and dependent upon the Fourteenth Amendment and hence is a right 'secured' by that Amendment. It finds its source in that Amendment. As recognized in Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 310, 25 L.Ed. 664, 'The Fourteenth Amendment makes no attempt to enumerate the rights it designed to protect. It speaks in general terms, and those are as comprehensive as possible. Its language is prohibitory; but every prohibition implies the existence of rights * * *.' The Fourteenth Amendment commands the State to provide the members of all races with equal access to the public facilities it owns or manages, and the right of a citizen to use those facilities without discrimination on the basis of race is a basic corollary of this command. Cf. Brewer v. Hoxie School District No. 46, etc., 238 F.2d 91 (C.A.8th Cir. 1956). Whatever may be the status of the right to equal utilization of privately owned facilities, see generally Bell v. State of Maryland, 378 U.S. 226, 84 S.Ct. 1814, 12 L.Ed.2d 822, it must be emphasized that we are here concerned with the right to equal utilization of public facilities owned or operated by or on behalf of the State. To deny the existence of this right or its constitutional stature is to deny the history of the last decade, or to ignore the role of federal power, predicated on the Fourteenth Amendment, in obtaining nondiscriminatory access to such facilities. It is to do violence to the common understanding, an understanding that found expression in Titles III and IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 246, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000b, 2000c (1964 ed.), dealing with state facilities. Those provisions reflect the view that the Fourteenth Amendment creates the right to equal utilization of state facilities. Congress did not preface those titles with a provision comparable to that in Title II5 explicitly creating the right to equal utilization of certain privately owned facilities. Congress rightly assumed that a specific legislative declaration of the right was unnecessary, that the right arose from the Fourteenth Amendment itself.\n\n\n79\nIn reversing the District Court's dismissal of the second numberee paragraph, I would therefore hold that proof at the trial of the conspiracy charged to the defendants in that paragraph will establish a violation of \u00a7 241 without regard to whether there is also proof that state law enforcement officers actively connived in causing the arrests of Negroes by means of false reports.\n\nII.\n\n80\nMy view as to the scope of \u00a7 241 requires that I reach the question of constitutional power\u2014whether \u00a7 241 or legislation indubitably designed to punish entirely private conspiracies to interfere with the exercise of Fourteenth Amendment rights constitutes a permissible exercise of the power granted to Congress by \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment 'to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of' the Amendment.\n\n\n81\nA majority of the members of the Court6 expresses the view today that \u00a7 5 empowers Congress to enact laws punishing all conspiracies to interfere with the exercise of Fourteenth Amendment rights, whether or not state officers or others acting under the color of state law are implicated in the conspiracy. Although the Fourteenth Amendment itself, according to established doctrine, 'speaks to the State or to those acting under the color of its authority,' legislation protecting rights created by that Amendment, such as the right to equal utilization of state facilities, need not be confined to punishing conspiracies in which state officers participate. Rather, \u00a7 5 authorizes Congress to make laws that it concludes are reasonably necessary to protect a right created by and arising under that Amendment; and Congress is thus fully empowered to determine that punishment of private conspiracies interfering with the exercise of such a right is necessary to its full protection. It made that determination in enacting \u00a7 241, see the Appendix in United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 807, 86 S.Ct. 1163, and, therefore \u00a7 241 is constitutional legislation as applied to reach the private conspiracy alleged in the second numbered paragraph of the indictment.\n\n\n82\nI acknowledge that some of the decisions of this Court, most notably an aspect of the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 11, 3 S.Ct. 18, 21, 27 L.Ed. 835, have declared that Congress' power under s 5 is confined to the adoption of 'appropriate legislation for correcting the effects of * * * prohibited state law and state acts, and thus to render them effectually null, void, and innocuous.' I do not accept\u2014and a majority of the Court today rejects\u2014this interpretation of \u00a7 5. It reduces the legislative power to enforce the provisions of the Amendment to that of the judiciary;7 and it attributes a far too limited objective to the Amendment's sponsors.8 Moreover, the language of \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and \u00a7 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment are virtually the same, and we recently held in State of South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, at 326, 86 S.Ct. 803, at 817, that '(t)he basic test to be applied in a case involving \u00a7 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment is the same as in all cases concerning the express powers of Congress with relation to the reserved powers of the States.' The classic formulation of that test by Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421, 4 L.Ed. 579, was there adopted:\n\n\n83\n'Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the      constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are      plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the latter and      spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.'\n\n\n84\nIt seems to me that this is also the standard that defines the scope of congressional authority under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Indeed, State of South Carolina v. Katzenbach approvingly refers to Ex parte State of Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 345\u2014346, 25 L.Ed. 676, a case involving the exercise of the congressional power under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, as adopting the McCulloch v. Maryland formulation for 'each of the Civil War Amendments.'\n\n\n85\nViewed in its proper perspective, \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment appears as a positive grant of legislative power, authorizing Congress to exercise its discretion in fashioning remedies to achieve civil and political equality for all citizens. Non one would deny that Congress could enact legislation directing state officials to provide Negroes with equal access to state schools, parks and other facilities owned or operated by the State. Nor could it be denied that Congress has the power to punish state officers who, in excess of their authority and in violation of state law, conspire to threaten, harass and murder Negroes for attempting to use these facilities.9 And I can find no principle of federalism nor word of the Constitution that denies Congress power to determine that in order adequately to protect the right to equal utilization of state facilities, it is also appropriate to punish other individuals\u2014not state officers themselves and not acting in concert with state officers\u2014who engage in the same brutal conduct for the same misguided purpose.10\n\nIII.\n\n86\nSection 241 is certainly not model legislation for punishing private conspiracies to interfere with the exercise of the right of equal utilization of state facilities. It deals in only general language 'with Federal rights, and with all Federal rights' and protects them 'in the lump,' United States v. Mosley, 238 U.S. 383, 386, 35 S.Ct. 904, 905, 59 L.Ed. 1355; it protects in most general terms 'any right or privilege so secured * * * by the Constitution and laws of the United States.' Congress has left it to the courts to mark the bounds of those words, to determine on a case-by-case basis whether the right purportedly threatened is a federal right. That determination may occur after the conduct charged has taken place or it may not have been anticipated in prior decisions; 'a penumbra of rights may be involved, which none can know until decision has been made and infraction may occur before it is had.'11 Reliance on such wording plainly brings \u00a7 241 close to the danger line of being void for vagueness.\n\n\n87\nBut, as the Court holds, a stringent scienter requirement saves \u00a7 241 from condemnation as a criminal statute failing to provide adequate notice of the proscribed conduct.12 The gravamen of the offense is conspiracy, and therefore, like a statute making certain conduct criminal only if it is done 'willfully,' \u00a7 241 requires proof of a specific intent for conviction. We have construed \u00a7 241 to require proof that the persons charged conspired to act in defiance, or in reckless disregard, of an announced rule making the federal right specific and definite. United States v. Williams, 341 U.S. 70, 93 95, 71 S.Ct. 581, 593\u2014595, 95 L.Ed. 758 (opinion of Douglas, J.); Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 101\u2014107, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 1035 1038, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (opinion of Douglas, J.) (involving the predecessor to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242). Since this case reaches us on the pleadings, there is no occasion to decide now whether the Government will be able on trial to sustain the burden of proving the requisite specific intent vis-a -vis the right to travel freely from State to State or the right to equal utilization of state facilities. Compare James v. United States, 366 U.S. 213, 221\u2014222, 81 S.Ct. 1052, 1056\u20141057, 6 L.Ed.2d 246 (opinion of Warren, C.J.). In any event, we may well agree that the necessity to discharge that burden can imperil the effectiveness of \u00a7 241 where, as is often the case, the pertinent constitutional right must be implied from a grant of congressional power or a prohibition upon the exercise of governmental power. But since the limitation on the statute's effectiveness derives from Congress' failure to define\u2014with any measure of specificity\u2014the rights encompassed, the remedy is for Congress to write a law without this defect. To paraphrase my Brother Douglas' observation in Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. at 105, 65 S.Ct. at 1037, 89 L.Ed. 1495, addressed to a companion statute with the same shortcoming, if Congress desires to give the statute more definite scope, it may find ways of doing so.\n\n\n\n1\n The indictment, filed on October 16, 1964, was as follows:\n'THE GRAND JURY CHARGES:\n'Commencing on or about January 1, 1964, and continuing to the date of this indictment, HERBERT GUEST, JAMES SPERGEON LACKEY, CECIL WILLIAM MYERS, DENVER WILLIS PHILLIPS, JOSEPH HOWARD SIMS, and GEORGE HAMPTON TURNER, did, within the Middle District of Georgia, Athens Division, conspire together, with each other, and with other persons to the Grand Jury unknown, to injure, oppress, threaten, and intimidate Negro citizens of the United States in the vicinity of Athens, Georgia, in the free exercise and enjoyment by said Negro citizens of the following rights and privileges secured to them by the Constitution and laws of the United States:\n'1. The right to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of motion picture theaters, restaurants, and other places of public accommodation;\n'2. The right to the equal utilization, without discrimination upon the basis of race, of public facilities in the vicinity of Athens, Georgia,\nowned, operated or managed by or on behalf of the State of Georgia or any subdivision thereof;\n'3. The right to the full and equal use on the same terms as white citizens of the public streets and highways in the vicinity of Athens, Georgia;\n'4. The right to travel freely to and from the State of Georgia and to use highway facilities and other instrumentalities of interstate commerce within the State of Georgia;\n'5. Other rights exercised and enjoyed by white citizens in the vicinity of Athens, Georgia.\n'It was a part of the plan and purpose of the conspiracy that its objects be achieved by various means, including the following:\n'1. By shooting Negroes;\n'2. By beating Negroes;\n'3. By killing Negroes;\n'4. By damaging and destroying property of Negroes;\n'5. By pursuing Negroes in automobiles and threatening them with guns;\n'6. By making telephone calls to Negroes to threaten their lives, property, and persons, and by making such threats in person;\n'7. By going in disguise on the highway and on the premises of other persons;\n'8. By causing the arrest of Negroes by means of false reports that such Negroes had committed criminal acts; and\n'9. By burning crosses at night in public view.\n'All in violation of Section 241, Title 18, United States Code.'\nThe only additional indication in the record concerning the factual details of the conduct with which the defendants were charged is the statement of the District Court that: 'It is common knowledge that two of the defendants, Sims and Myers, have already been prosecuted in the Superior Court of Madison County, Georgia for the murder of Lemuel A. Penn and by a jury found not guilty.' 246 F.Supp. 475, 487.\n\n\n2\n This appeal concerns only the first four numbered paragraphs of the indictment. The Government conceded in the District Court that the fifth paragraph added nothing to the indictment, and no question is raised here as to the dismissal of that paragraph.\n\n\n3\n Section 201(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000a(a) (1964 ed.), provides:\n'All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin.'\nThe criteria for coverage of motion picture theaters by the Act are stated in \u00a7\u00a7 201(b)(3) and 201(c)(3), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000a(b)(3) and 2000a(c)(3) (1964 ed.); the criteria for coverage of restaurants are stated in \u00a7\u00a7 201(b)(2) and 201(c)(2), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000a(b)(2) and 2000a(c)(2) (1964 ed.). No issue is raised here as to the failure of the indictment to allege specifically that the Act is applicable to the places of public accommodation described in this paragraph of the indictment.\n\n\n4\n The District Court said: 'The Government contends that the rights enumerated in paragraph 1 stem from Title 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and thus automatically come within the purview of \u00a7 241. The Government conceded on oral argument that paragraph one would add nothing to the indictment absent the Act. It is not clear how the rights mentioned in paragraph one can be said to come from the Act because \u00a7 201(a), upon which the draftsman doubtless relied, lists the essential element 'without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin.' This element is omitted from paragraph one of the indictment, and does not appear in the charging part of the indictment. The Supreme Court said in (United States v.) Cruikshank, supra, 92 U.S. (542) at page 556 (23 L.Ed. 588), where deprivation of right to vote was involved,\n\"We may suspect that 'race' was the cause of the hostility; but it is not so averred. This is material to a description of the substance of the offense and cannot be supplied by implication. Everything essential must be charged positively, not inferentially. The defect here is not in form, but in substance.\" 246 F.Supp. 475, 484.\n\n\n5\n Section 207(b) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000a\u20146(b) (1964 ed.), states:\n'The remedies provided in this title shall be the exclusive means of enforcing the rights based on this title, but nothing in this title shall preclude any individual or any State or local agency from asserting any right based on any other Federal or State law not inconsistent with this title, including any statute or ordinance requiring nondiscrimination in public establishments or accommodations, or from pursuing any remedy, civil or criminal, which may be available for the vindication or enforcement of such right.'\nRelying on this provision and its legislative history, the District Court said: 'It seems crystal clear that the Congress in enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not intend to subject anyone to any possible criminal penalties except those specifically provided for in the Act itself.' 246 F.Supp., at 485.\n\n\n6\n See, e.g., Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (schools); New Orleans City Park Improvement Assn. v. Detiege, 358 U.S. 54, 79 S.Ct. 99, 3 L.Ed.2d 46; Wright v.

Insofar as the third paragraph refers to the use of streets or highways in interstate commerce, it is covered by the present discussion of the fourth numbered paragraph of the indictment.\n\n\n14\n Art. IV, Articles of Confederation.\n\n\n15\n See Chafee, Three Human Rights in the Constitution of 1787, at 185 (1956).\n\n\n16\n The District Court relied heavily on United States v. Wheeler, 254 U.S. 281, 41 S.Ct. 133, 65 L.Ed. 270, in dismissing this branch of the indictment. That case involved an alleged conspiracy to compel residents of Arizona to move out of that State. The right of interstate travel was, therefore, not directly involved. Whatever continuing validity Wheeler may have as restricted to its own facts, the dicta in the Wheeler opinion relied on by the District Court in the present case have been discredited in subsequent decisions. Cf. Edwards v. People of State of California, 314 U.S. 160, 177, 180, 62 S.Ct. 164, 168, 170, 86 L.Ed. 119 (Douglas, J., concurring); United States v. Williams, 341 U.S. 70, 80, 71 S.Ct. 581, 586, 95 L.Ed. 758.\n\n\n17\n As emphasized in Mr. Justice HARLAN'S separate opinion, \u00a7 241 protects only against interference with rights secured by other federal laws or by the Constitution itself. The right to interstate travel is a right that the Constitution itself guarantees, as the cases cited in the text make clear. Although these cases in fact involved governmental interference with the right of free interstate travel, their reasoning fully supports the conclusion that the constitutional right of interstate travel is a right secured against interference from any source whatever, whether governmental or private. In this connection, it is important to reiterate that the right to travel freely from State to State finds constitutional protection that is quite independent of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nWe are not concerned here with the extent to which interstate travel may be regulated or controlled by the exercise of a State's police power acting within the confines of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Edwards v. People of State of California, 314 U.S. 160, 184, 62 S.Ct. 164, 171\u2014172, 86 L.Ed. 119 (concurring opinion); People of State of New York v. O'Neill, 359 U.S. 1, 6\u20148, 79 S.Ct. 564, 568\u2014570, 3 L.Ed.2d 585. Nor is there any issue here as to the permissible extent of federal interference with the right within the confines of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Cf. Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U.S. 1, 85 S.Ct. 1271, 14 L.Ed.2d 179; Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U.S. 500, 84 S.Ct. 1659, 12 L.Ed.2d 992; Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116, 78 S.Ct. 1113, 2 L.Ed.2d 1204.\n\n\n1\n The action of three of the Justices who join the Court's opinion in nonetheless cursorily pronouncing themselves on the far-reaching constitutional questions deliberately not reached in Part II seems to me, to say the very least, extraordinary.\n\n\n2\n For a discussion of the deportations, see The President's Mediation Comm'n, Report on the Bisbee, Deportations (November 6, 1917).\n\n\n3\n The Court's reliance on United States v. Moore, C.C., 129 F. 630, is misplaced. That case held only that it was not a privilege or immunity to organize labor unions. The reference to 'the right to pass from one state to any other' was purely incidental dictum.\n\n\n4\n It is not even clear that an equity court would enjoin a conspiracy of the kind alleged here, for traditionally equity will not enjoin a crime. See Developments in the Law\u2014Injunctions, 78 Harv.L.Rev. 994, 1013\u20141018 (1965).\n\n\n5\n In Three Human Rights in the Constitution of 1787, at 162 (1956).\n\n\n1\n As I read the indictment, the allegation regarding the false arrest relates to all the other paragraphs and not merely, as the Court suggests, to the second numbered paragraph of the indictment. See n. 1 in the Court's opinion. Hence, assuming that, as maintained by the Court, the allegation could be construed to encompass discriminatory conduct by state law enforcement officers, it would be a sufficient basis for preventing the dismissal of each of the other paragraphs of the indictment. The right to be free from discriminatory conduct by law enforcement officers while using privately owned places of public accommodation (paragraph one) or while traveling from State to State (paragraphs three and four), or while doing anything else, is unquestionably secured by the Equal Protection Clause. It would therefore be unnecessary to decide whether the right to travel from State to State is itself a right secured by the Constitution or whether paragraph one is defective either because of the absence of an allegation of a racial discriminatory motive or because of the exclusive remedy provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \u00a7 207(b), 78 Stat. 246, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000a\u20146(b) (1964 ed.).\n\n\n2\n I see no basis for a reading more consistent with my own view in the isolated statement in the Court's opinion that 'the rights under the Equal Protection Clause described by this paragraph (two) of the indictment have been * * * firmly and precisely established by a consistent line of decisions in this Court * * *.'\n\n\n3\n Similarly, I believe that \u00a7 241 reaches a private conspiracy to interfere with the right to travel from State to State. I therefore need not reach the question whether the Constitution of its own force prohibits private interferences with that right; for I construe \u00a7 241 to prohibit such interferences, and as so construed I am of the opinion that \u00a7 241 is a valid exercise of congressional power.\n\n\n4\n This premise is questionable. Title III of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 246, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000b (1964 ed.), authorizes the Attorney General on complaint from an individual that he is 'being denied equal utilization of any public facility which is owned, operated, or managed by or on behalf of any State or subdivision,' to commence a civil action 'for such relief as may be appropriate' and against such parties as are 'necessary to the grant of effective relief.' Arguably this would authorize relief against private parties not acting in concert with state officers. (This title of the Act does not have an exclusive remedy similar to \u00a7 207(b) of Title II, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000a\u20146(b).)\nThe Court affirmatively disclaims any intention to deal with Title III of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in connection with the second numbered paragraph of the indictment. But, as the District Judge observed in his opinion, the Government maintained that the right described in that paragraph was 'secured' by the Fourteenth Amendment and, 'additionally,' by Title III of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 246 F.Supp., at 484. That position was not effectively abandoned in this Court.\n\n\n5\n 'All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin.' 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000a(a) (1964 ed.).\n\n\n6\n The majority consists of the Justices joining my Brother CLARK'S opinion and the Justice joining this opinion. The opinion of Mr. Justice STEWART construes \u00a7 241 as applied to the second numbered paragraph to require proof of active participation by state officers in the alleged conspiracy and that opinion does not purport to deal with this question.\n\n\n7\n Congress, not the judiciary, was viewed as the more likely agency to implement fully the guarantees of equality, and thus it could be presumed the primary purpose of the Amendment was to augment the power of Congress, not the judiciary. See James, The Framing of the Fourteenth Amendment 184 (1956); Harris, The Quest for Equality 53\u201454 (1960); Frantz, Congressional Power to Enforce the Fourteenth Amendment Against Private Acts, 73 Yale L.J. 1353, 1356 (1964).\n\n\n8\n As the first Mr. Justice Harlan said in dissent in the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. at 54, 3 S.Ct. at 52, 27 L.Ed. 835: 'It was perfectly well known that the great danger to the equal enjoyment by citizens of their rights, as citizens, was to be apprehended, not altogether from unfriendly state legislation, but from the hostile action of corporations and individuals in the states. And it is to be presumed that it was intended, by that section (\u00a7 5), to clothe congress with power and authority to meet that danger.' See United States v.

McDANIEL et al., Petitioners,v.Jose SANCHEZ et al.\nNo. 80-180.\nArgued March 2, 1981.\nDecided June 1, 1981.\n\n\nSyllabus\n\nAfter holding that the apportionment plan for precincts from which county commissioners were elected to serve on the Commissioners Court for Kleberg County, Tex., was unconstitutional because of substantial population variances in the precincts, the District Court directed county officials to submit a proposed reapportionment plan to the court.  The Commissioners Court then employed an expert to prepare a new plan and subsequently adopted his plan and submitted it to the District Court.  The court approved the plan and authorized the Commissioners Court to conduct 1980 primary and general elections under it, rejecting respondents' contention that \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (Act) required the county, a jurisdiction covered by the Act, to obtain preclearance from either the Attorney General of the United States or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia before the plan could become effective.  The Court of Appeals vacated the District Court's order, holding that \"[a] proposed reapportionment plan submitted by a local legislative body does not lose its status as a legislative rather than court-ordered plan merely because it is the product of litigation conducted in a federal forum,\" and that the Act required preclearance.\nHeld :  Congress intended to require compliance with the statutory preclearance procedures under the circumstances of this case.  Whenever a covered jurisdiction submits a proposal reflecting the policy choices of the elected representatives of the people\u2014no matter what constraints have limited the choices available to them\u2014the preclearance requirement of the Act is applicable.  Pp. 137-153.\n(a) The statement in East Carroll Parish School Board v. Marshall, 424 U.S. 636, 96 S.Ct. 1083, 47 L.Ed.2d 296\u2014which held that a court-adopted reapportionment plan suggested by the local legislative body there involved was a judicial plan for purposes of substantive review\u2014that the plan was also a judicial plan for purposes of \u00a7 5 preclearance was dictum and does not control this case.  Pp. 139-146.\n(b) The language of \u00a7 5 does not unambiguously answer the question, but the legislative history of the 1975 amendments of the Act shows that it was intended that the statutory protections are to be available even when redistricting by the governmental body is ordered by a federal court to remedy a constitutional violation that has been established in pending federal litigation.  Pp. 146-153.\n615 F.2d 1023, affirmed.\nRichard A. Hall, Corpus Christi, Tex., for petitioners.\nRobert J. Parmley, Alice, Tex., for respondents.\nLawrence G. Wallace, Washington, D. C., for the United States as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\nJustice STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nWe granted certiorari to decide whether the preclearance requirement of \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended,1 applies to a reapportionment plan submitted to a Federal District Court by the legislative body of a covered jurisdiction2 in response to a judicial determination that the existing apportionment of its electoral districts is unconstitutional.  Relying on East Carroll Parish School Board v. Marshall, 424 U.S. 636, 96 S.Ct. 1083, 47 L.Ed.2d 296 (per curiam), the District Court held that the plan submitted to it in this case was a judicial plan and thus excepted from the requirements of \u00a7 5.  Relying on Wise v. Lipscomb, 437 U.S. 535, 98 S.Ct. 2493, 57 L.Ed.2d 411, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed;  it held that because the plan had been prepared by a legislative body, it was a legislative plan within the coverage of \u00a7 5.  We are persuaded that Congress intended to require compliance with the statutory preclearance procedures under the circumstances of this case. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n2\nThe covered jurisdiction in this case is Kleberg County, a rural county in Texas.  Under Texas law, a Commissioners Court, which is composed of four county commissioners presided over by the county judge, is authorized to govern Kleberg County.  The county is divided periodically by the Commissioners Court into four commissioners' precincts, each of which elects a resident to the position of county commissioner.  The county judge is elected at large.  The county commissioners and the county judge serve 4-year terms.3\n\n\n3\nIn January 1978, four Mexican-American residents of Kleberg County brought this class action against various county officials alleging that the apportionment of the four commissioners' precincts denied individual residents of the larger precincts a vote of equal weight, and unconstitutionally diluted the voting strength of the county's substantial Mexican-American population.4 After a trial,5 the District Court rejected the plaintiffs' claim that the county's apportionment plan unconstitutionally diluted the voting power of Mexican-Americans as a class, but held that individual voters were denied equal representation because of the substantial disparity in the number of residents in each commissioners' precinct.6  The District Court therefore directed the county officials to submit a proposed reapportionment plan to the court within six weeks, and scheduled a hearing on the validity of the proposal for four weeks thereafter.7\n\n\n4\nPursuant to the District Court's order, the Commissioners Court undertook the task of devising a new apportionment plan. The Commissioners Court employed Dr. Robert Nash, a statistician and the Dean of the College of Business at Texas A. & I. University, to prepare a new plan, instructing him to define the commissioners' precincts \"on a one-person\/one-vote basis.\"8  With one insignificant modification, the9Commissioners Court officially adopted the plan prepared by Dr. Nash as the plan it would submit to the District Court.\n\n\n5\nRespondents objected to the proposed plan.  They challenged the data used by the Dean, they claimed that the plan diluted the voting strength of Mexican-Americans, and they contended that the Voting Rights Act required the county to obtain preclearance from the Attorney General of the United States or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia before the plan could become effective.10  After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court rejected both of respondents' factual contentions, and held as a matter of law that the Voting Rights Act did not require preclearance.  The court entered an order approving the new plan and authorizing the Commissioners Court to conduct the 1980 primary and general elections under it.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. A-21 to A-23.\n\n\n6\nWithout expressing any opinion with respect to the constitutionality of the new plan, the Court of Appeals vacated the District Court's order in a per curiam opinion.  See 615 F.2d 1023 (1980).  Reasoning that \"[a] proposed reapportionment plan submitted by a local legislative body does not lose its status as a legislative rather than court-ordered plan merely because it is the product of litigation conducted in a federal forum,\" id., at 1024, the Court of Appeals held that the Voting Rights Act required preclearance.  The court thereafter denied petitioners' application for a stay pending filing and consideration of a petition for writ of certiorari.  On August 14, 1980, however, Justice POWELL, in his capacity as Circuit Justice, entered an order recalling the mandate and staying the judgment of the Court of Appeals pending disposition of the petition for certiorari. 448 U.S. 1318, 101 S.Ct. 7, 65 L.Ed.2d 1142.  We granted that petition because the question presented is important and because the answer suggested by our prior opinions is not free of ambiguity.  449 U.S. 898, 101 S.Ct. 265, 66 L.Ed.2d 127.11\n\n\n7\nIn this Court, the county officials contend that the Voting Rights Act does not apply to a plan that \"(a) was prepared and presented in response to an order by the district court, (b) was not prepared by county officials but by a third party expert, (c) was not adopted by the county before submission to the court, (d) was considered by the trial court to be court-ordered, and (e) was put into effect only after county officials were ordered to do so by the trial court.\"12\n\n\n8\nWe first consider the significance of the distinction between legislative and court-ordered plans as identified in our prior cases.  We then review our decisions in East Carroll and Wise v. Lipscomb, on which the District Court and the Court of Appeals respectively placed primary reliance.  Finally, we examine the statute and its legislative history.\n\n\n9\n* Texas and its political subdivisions are covered by the Voting Rights Act.  Briscoe v. Bell, 432 U.S. 404, 97 S.Ct. 2428, 53 L.Ed.2d 439.13  Section 5 of the Act is applicable whenever a covered jurisdiction \"shall enact or seek to administer any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting different from that in force or effect on November 1, 1972. . . .\"  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c.  A reapportionment plan is a \"standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting\" within the meaning of \u00a7 5, Georgia v. United States, 411 U.S. 526, 531-535, 93 S.Ct. 1702, 1708, 36 L.Ed.2d 472, and it is undisputed that Kleberg County is a covered jurisdiction.  What is in dispute is whether that jurisdiction did \"enact or seek to administer\" a proposed reapportionment plan when it presented that plan to a Federal District Court as a proposed remedy for a constitutional violation.  If the statute does apply, then the plan must be precleared either by the Attorney General of the United States or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia before it may become effective.14  In such a preclearance proceeding, it is not sufficient to demonstrate that the new plan is constitutional;  the covered jurisdiction also has the burden of demonstrating that the districting changes are not motivated by a discriminatory purpose and will not have an adverse impact on minority voters.  See e. g., City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 172-173, 100 S.Ct. 1548, 1559-1560, 64 L.Ed.2d 119. Two polar propositions are perfectly clear.  First, the Act requires preclearance of new legislative apportionment plans that are adopted without judicial direction or approval.  See Georgia v. United States, supra.  Second, the Act's preclearance requirement does not apply to plans prepared and adopted by a federal court to remedy a constitutional violation.  See Connor v. Johnson, 402 U.S. 690, 91 S.Ct. 1760, 29 L.Ed.2d 268 (per curiam ).15  Petitioners contend that the Act does not apply to this reapportionment plan because it is a court-ordered plan, while respondents argue that the Act does apply because the plan was prepared and submitted on behalf of the local legislative body.\n\n\n10\nIn prior reapportionment cases not arising under the Voting Rights Act, we have recognized important differences between legislative plans and court-ordered plans.  Because \"reapportionment is primarily the duty and responsibility of the State through its legislature or other body, rather than of a federal court,\" Chapman v. Meier, 420 U.S. 1, 27, 95 S.Ct. 751, 766, 42 L.Ed.2d 766, the Court has tolerated somewhat greater flexibility in the fashioning of legislative remedies for violation of the one-person, one-vote rule than when a federal court prepares its own remedial decree.  Thus, in Chapman we held that \"unless there are persuasive justifications, a court-ordered reapportionment plan of a state legislature must avoid use of multimember districts, and, as well, must ordinarily achieve the goal of population equality with little more than de minimis variation.\"  Id., at 26-27, 95 S.Ct., at 765-766 (footnote omitted).16  In contrast, reapportionment plans prepared by legislative bodies may employ multimember districts and may result in greater population disparities than would be permitted in a court-ordered plan.  See Connor v. Finch, 431 U.S. 407, 414-415, 97 S.Ct. 1828, 1833-1834, 52 L.Ed.2d 465.  Cf. Mahan v. Howell, 410 U.S. 315, 93 S.Ct. 979, 35 L.Ed.2d 320.\n\n\n11\nIn this case, we are concerned only with the question whether the reapportionment plan submitted to the District Court should be considered a legislative plan for purposes of preclearance under \u00a7 5.  We are not presented with any question concerning the substantive acceptability of that plan.  Nonetheless, we draw significant guidance from prior cases in which the substantive acceptability of a reapportionment plan, rather than the applicability of \u00a7 5, was at issue.\n\nII\n\n12\nIn neither of the cases on which the respective parties now place their primary reliance did the Court predicate its decision on the Voting Rights Act.  In both of those cases, the question before the Court was whether it was error for the District Court to approve the inclusion of a multimember district in the reapportionment plan under review.\n\n\n13\nIn East Carroll Parish School Board v. Marshall, 424 U.S. 636, 96 S.Ct. 1083, 47 L.Ed.2d 296 (per curiam), the plaintiff contended that population disparities among the parish's wards had unconstitutionally denied him the right to cast an effective vote for representatives to the school board and the police jury, the governing body of the parish.  The District Court found that the parish's existing apportionment was unconstitutional.  As a remedy, the court adopted a reapportionment plan, suggested by the police jury, that provided for at-large election of the members of both the police jury and the school board.  Following the 1970 census, the District Court directed the police jury and school board to submit revised reapportionment plans.  They resubmitted the plan calling for at-large elections, and the District Court again approved this plan.  After a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's decision,17 the court sitting en banc reversed on the ground that the multimember arrangement approved by the District Court was unconstitutional.18\n\n\n14\nWhen we reviewed the case, we concluded that it was improper for the Court of Appeals to base its decision on a constitutional ground in view of the fact that the District Court had violated the frequently reaffirmed \"rule that when United States district courts are put to the task of fashioning reapportionment plans to supplant concededly invalid state legislation, single-member districts are to be preferred absent unusual circumstances.\"  Id., at 639, 96 S.Ct., at 1085.  Thus, we held in East Carroll that the plan approved by the District Court was a judicial plan for purposes of substantive review.\n\n\n15\nAlthough the issue was not raised by the parties, we also stated in East Carroll that the plan was a judicial plan for purposes of \u00a7 5 preclearance.  Neither of the parties had argued that \u00a7 5's preclearance requirement was applicable in that case. However, the United States, as amicus curiae, had contended that, because the plan had been submitted by the legislative bodies of a covered jurisdiction, preclearance was required.  We rejected that argument in a footnote:\n\n\n16\n\"[C]ourt-ordered plans resulting from equitable jurisdiction      over adversary proceedings are not controlled by \u00a7 5.  Had      the East Carroll police jury reapportioned itself on its own      authority, clearance under \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act would      clearly have been required.  Connor v. Waller, 421 U.S. 656      [95 S.Ct. 2003, 44 L.Ed.2d 486] (1975).  However, in      submitting the plan to the District Court, the jury did not      purport to reapportion itself in accordance with the 1968      enabling legislation . . . which permitted police juries and      school boards to adopt at-large elections.  App. 56.      Moreover, since the Louisiana enabling legislation was      opposed by the Attorney General of the United States under \u00a7      5 of the Voting Rights Act, the jury did not have the      authority to reapportion itself. . . .  Since the      reapportionment scheme was submitted and adopted pursuant to      court order, the preclearance procedures of \u00a7 5 do not apply.      Connor v. Johnson, 402 U.S. 690, 691 [91 S.Ct. 1760, 1761, 29      L.Ed.2d 268] (1971).\"  424 U.S., at 638-639, n. 6, 96 S.Ct.,      at 1085, n. 6.\n\n\n17\nPetitioners rely heavily upon this footnote.  While their reliance is understandable, the footnote is not dispositive in this case.  The discussion of \u00a7 5 in East Carroll was dictum unnecessary to the decision in that case.  It is, therefore, not controlling in this case, in which the impact of \u00a7 5 is directly placed in issue.19  Moreover, our subsequent decision in Wise v Limpscomb, 437 U.S. 535, 98 S.Ct. 2493, 57 L.Ed.2d 411, indicates that, at least to the extent that East Carroll addressed the Voting Rights Act, it must be narrowly limited to its particular facts.\n\n\n18\nIn Wise v. Lipscomb, the District Court held that the system of at-large election to the Dallas City Council unconstitutionally diluted the voting strength of black citizens.  The court thereafter gave the City Council an opportunity to prepare and submit a new apportionment plan.  In response, the City Council passed a resolution stating the Council's intention to pass an ordinance providing for the election of eight council members from single-member districts, and for the election of the three remaining members from the city at large.  The District Court conducted a hearing \" 'to determine the constitutionality of the new proposed plan' \" and held that it was \"a valid legislative Act.\"  See 437 U.S., at 538-539, 98 S.Ct., at 2496.  The Court of Appeals reversed, relying on East Carroll to hold that it was error for the District Court merely to evaluate the new plan under constitutional standards without also deciding whether exceptional circumstances justified the inclusion of a multimember district in that judicially imposed reapportionment plan.  See 551 F.2d 1043 (CA5 1977).\n\n\n19\nThe question this Court addressed was whether the District Court had committed error by failing to apply the usual presumption against multimember districts in judicial reapportionment plans.  In his opinion announcing the judgment of the Court, Justice WHITE, joined by Justice STEWART, answered that question by holding that the presumption did not apply because it is \"appropriate, whenever practicable, to afford a reasonable opportunity for the legislature to meet constitutional requirements by adopting a substitute measure rather than for the federal court to devise and order into effect its own plan.\"  437 U.S., at 540, 98 S.Ct., at 2497.  Justice WHITE distinguished East Carroll on the ground that the legislative bodies in that case had not been purported to reapportion themselves and, in deed, had been without power to reapportion themselves under state law because the Louisiana enabling statute had been invalidated under the Voting Rights Act.20  The Dallas City Council, in contrast, had acted within its inherent legislative authority in devising and submitting a reapportionment plan to replace the plan invalidated by the District Court in Wise.  See 437 U.S., at 545-546, 98 S.Ct., at 2500.\n\n\n20\nJustice POWELL's separate opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, was joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice BLACKMUN, and Justice REHNQUIST.  Justice POWELL agreed with Justice WHITE's conclusion that the Dallas reapportionment plan was a legislative plan for purposes of the application of the presumption against multimember districts.  However, relying upon Burns v. Richardson, 384 U.S. 73, 86 S.Ct. 1286, 16 L.Ed.2d 376, Justice POWELL disagreed with Justice WHITE's suggestion that East Carroll had held that a proposed reapportionment plan may be considered legislative only if the legislative body that suggested the plan had authority to enact it under state law.  437 U.S., at 548, 98 S.Ct., at 2501.21  In Justice POWELL's view, the legislative body's authority under state law was irrelevant to the question before the Court.  He explained that the critical difference between a legislative plan and a court-imposed plan for purposes of substantive review was that the former reflected the policy choices of the elected representatives of the people, whereas the latter represented the remedial directive of a federal court.22  Deference to the judgment of the legislative body was required even if that body lacked authority under state law to adopt the proposed reapportionment plan.23\n\n\n21\nIn dissent, Justice MARSHALL, joined by Justice BRENNAN and Justice STEVENS, expressed the opinion that Wise was indistinguishable from East Carroll and that the Court of Appeals therefore had correctly applied the presumption against multimember districts.  437 U.S., at 550-554, 98 S.Ct., at 2502-2504.  Justice MARSHALL, however, agreed with the majority that it would not be proper to reach any question under the Voting Rights Act because Texas had not been subject to the Act when the case was pending in the District Court.24\n\n\n22\nWhile it is clear that Wise, like East Carroll, did not require the Court to decide any statutory issue, the references to \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act in Justice WHITE's opinion announcing the judgment of the Court are nevertheless instructive.  After pointing out that \"the distinctive impact\" of \u00a7 5 upon the power of the States to reapportion themselves must be observed in the normal case, 437 U.S., at 541-542, 98 S.Ct., at 2497-2498, Justice WHITE stated:\n\n\n23\n\"Plans imposed by court order are not subject to the      requirements of \u00a7 5, but under that provision, a State or      political subdivision subject to the Act may not 'enact or      seek to administer' any 'different' voting qualification or      procedure with respect to voting without either obtaining a      declaratory judgment from the United States District Court      for the District of Columbia that the proposed change 'does not have the purpose and will not have the      effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account      of race or color' or submitting the change to the Attorney      General and affording him an appropriate opportunity to      object thereto.  A new reapportionment plan enacted by a      State, including one purportedly adopted in response to      invalidation of the prior plan by a federal court, will not      be considered 'effective as law,' Connor v. Finch, 431 U.S.,      at 412 [97 S.Ct., at 1832];  Connor v. Waller, 421 U.S. 656      [95 S.Ct. 2003, 44 L.Ed.2d 486] (1975), until it has been      submitted and has received clearance under \u00a7 5.  Neither, in      those circumstances, until clearance has been obtained,      should a court address the constitutionality of the new      measure.  Connor v. Finch, supra;  Connor v. Waller, supra.\"      Id., at 542, 98 S.Ct., at 2498 (footnote omitted).\n\n\n24\nNeither East Carroll nor Wise decided the precise question that is now presented.  Nonetheless, both Justice WHITE's opinion and Justice POWELL's opinion surely foreshadowed the holding we announce today.  For both opinions indicate that the fact that the reapportionment plan before us was devised in response to an order of a federal court does not change its character as a legislative plan.  In addition, Justice POWELL's opinion indicates that the Commissioners Court's power under Texas law to adopt this plan should be irrelevant to the decision in this case.\n\nIII\n\n25\nThis is not a case in which the language of the controlling statute unambiguously answers the question presented.  The Solicitor General, on behalf of the United States as amicus curiae, contends that a covered jurisdiction \"seek[s] to administer\" a new voting practice when it submits a redistricting plan to a district court as a proposed remedy for a constitutional violation.  This is a plausible but not an obviously correct reading of the statutory language.  For there is force to the contrary argument that Kleberg County had no intention to administer any new plan until after it was given legal effect by incorporation in a judicial decree.  Arguably, therefore, the statute has no application before the District Court enters its decree, and because the Act does not require the District Court to have its decisions precleared, seeConnor v. Johnson, 402 U.S. 690, 91 S.Ct. 1760, 29 L.Ed.2d 268, once such a decree is entered it is too late for the statute to qualify the county's duty to administer the plan as entered by the District Court.  We find sufficient ambiguity in the statutory language to make it appropriate to turn to legislative history for guidance.\n\n\n26\nIn 1975, when Congress adopted the amendments that ultimately brought Texas and Kleberg County within the coverage of the Act, it directed special attention to \u00a7 5 and to the redistricting that would be required after the 1980 census.25  In its Report on S. 1279, the bill that extended the life of the Voting Rights Act beyond 1975, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary explained \"the future need for the Act\" by pointing out that redrafting of district lines to correct violations of the one-person, one-vote rule created opportunities to disenfranchise minority voters.26 \"By providing that Section 5 protections not be removed before 1985, S. 1279 would guarantee Federal protection of minority voting rights during the years that the post-census redistrictings will take place.\"27\n\n\n27\nThe Committee unambiguously stated that the statutory protections are to be available even when the redistricting is ordered by a federal court to remedy a constitutional violation that has been established in pending federal litigation.  The Committee Report is crystal clear on this point:\n\n\n28\n\"Thus, for example, where a federal district court holds      unconstitutional an appointment plan which predates the      effective date of coverage under the Voting Rights Act, any      subsequent plan ordinarily would be subject to Section 5      review.  In the typical case, the court either will direct      the governmental body to adopt a new plan and present it to      the court for consideration or else itself choose a plan from      among those presented by various parties to the litigation.      In either situation, the court should defer its consideration      of\u2014or selection among\u2014any plans presented to it until such      time as these plans have been submitted for Section 5 review.      Only after such review should the district court proceed to      any remaining fourteenth or fifteenth amendment questions      that may be raised.\n\n\n29\n\"The one exception where Section 5 review would not      ordinarily be available is where the court, because of exigent circumstances, actually fashions the plan itself      instead of relying on a plan presented by a litigant.  This      is the limited meaning of the 'court decree' exception      recognized in Connor v. Johnson, 402 U.S. 690 [91 S.Ct. 1760,      29 L.Ed.2d 268] (1971).  Even in these cases, however, if the      governmental body subsequently adopts a plan patterned after      the court's plan, Section 5 review would be required, Connor      v. Waller, supra.  Furthermore, in fashioning the plan, the      court should follow the appropriate Section 5 standards,      including the body of administrative and judicial precedents      developed in Section 5 cases.\"  Senate Report, at 18-19.28\n\n\n30\nThe view expressed by the Committee is consistent with the basic purposes of the statute and with the well-settled rule that \u00a7 5 is to be given a broad construction.  See, e. g., Dougherty County Board of Education v. White, 439 U.S. 32, 38, 99 S.Ct. 368, 372, 58 L.Ed.2d 269;  United States v. Sheffield Board of Commissioners, 435 U.S. 110, 122-123, 98 S.Ct. 965, 974-975, 55 L.Ed.2d 148;  Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U.S. 379, 387, 91 S.Ct. 431, 436, 27 L.Ed.2d 476.  The preclearance procedure is designed to forestall the danger that local decisions to modify voting practices will impair minority access to the electoral process.29 The federal interest in preventing local jurisdictions from making changes that adversely affect the rights of minority voters is the same whether a change is required to remedy a constitutional violation or is merely the product of a community's perception of the desirability of responding to new social patterns.30\n\n\n31\nIt is true, of course, that the federal interest may be protected by the federal district court presiding over voting rights litigation, but sound reasons support the Committee's view that the normal \u00a7 5 preclearance procedures should nevertheless be followed in cases such as this.31  The procedures contemplated by the statute reflect a congressional choice in favor of specialized review\u2014either by the Attorney General of the United States or by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  Because a large number of voting changes must necessarily undergo the preclearance process, centralized review enhances the likelihood that recurring problems will be resolved in a consistent and expeditious way.32  Moreover, if covered jurisdictions could avoid the normal preclearance procedure by awaiting litigation challenging a refusal to redistrict after a census is completed, the statute might have the unintended effect of actually encouraging delay in making obviously needed changes in district boundaries.  The federal interest in evenhanded review of all changes in covered jurisdictions is furthered by the application of the statute in cases such as this.\n\n\n32\nThe application of the statute is not dependent on a showing that the county's proposed plan is defective in any way.  Cf. United States v. Board of Supervisors of Warren County, 429 U.S. 642, 97 S.Ct. 833, 51 L.Ed.2d 106 (per curiam);  Morris v. Gressette, 432 U.S. 491, 97 S.Ct. 2411, 53 L.Ed.2d 506.  The prophylactic purposes of the \u00a7 5 remedy are achieved by automatically requiring \"review of all voting changes prior to implementation by the covered jurisdictions.\"  Senate Report, at 15 (emphasis supplied).33  It is therefore not material that the plan submitted by the Commissioners Court of Kleberg County in this case was actually prepared by an independent expert.  His expertise may facilitate the satisfactory completion of the preclearance process, but it does not obviate the preclearance requirement itself.  For just as the reasons for the county's decision to purpose a new plan are irrelevant to the statutory preclearance requirement, so also is the particular method that is employed in formulating the plan that is submitted to the court on behalf of the county irrelevant.\n\n\n33\nThe application of the statute also is not dependent upon any showing that the Commissioners Court had authority under state law to enact the apportionment plan at issue in this case.34  As Justice POWELL pointed out in Wise v. Lipscomb, 437 U.S. 535, 98 S.Ct. 2493, 57 L.Ed.2d 411, the essential characteristic of a legislative plan is the exercise of legislative judgment.  The fact that particular requirements of state law may not be satisfied before a plan is proposed to a federal court does not alter this essential characteristic.  The applicability of \u00a7 5 to specific remedial plans is a matter of federal law that federal courts should determine pursuant to a uniform federal rule.\n\n\n34\nAs we construe the congressional mandate, it requires that whenever a covered jurisdiction submits a proposal reflecting the policy choices of the elected representatives of the people\u2014no matter what constraints have limited the choices available to them the preclearance requirement of the Voting Rights Act is applicable.35  It was, therefore, error for the District Court to act on the county's proposed plan before it had been submitted to the Attorney General or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for preclearance.\n\n\n35\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore affirmed.\n\n\n36\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n37\nJustice POWELL, concurring.\n\n\n38\nThe decision today is foreshadowed by Wise v. Lipscomb, 437 U.S. 535, 98 S.Ct. 2493, 57 L.Ed.2d 411 (1978), and I join the Court's opinion.  The constitutionality of \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has been sustained by prior cases.  If the question were presented for reconsideration, I would adhere to the contrary view as previously expressed.  City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 193, 100 S.Ct. 1548, 1570, 64 L.Ed.2d 1119 (1980) (POWELL, J., dissenting);  Dougherty County Bd. of Ed. v. White, 439 U.S. 32, 48, 99 S.Ct. 368, 377, 58 L.Ed.2d 269 (1978) (POWELL, J., dissenting);  Georgia v. United States, 411 U.S. 526, 545, 93 S.Ct. 1702, 1713, 36 L.Ed.2d 472 (1973) (POWELL, J., dissenting).  See also United States v. Sheffield, Board of Commissioners, 435 U.S. 110, 141, 98 S.Ct. 965, 984, 55 L.Ed.2d 148 (1978) (STEVENS, J., dissenting);  Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 586, and n.4, 89 S.Ct. 817, 842, and n.4, 22 L.Ed.2d 1 (1969) (HARLAN, J., concurringin part and dissenting in part);  South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 358, 86 S.Ct. 803, 833, 15 L.Ed.2d 769 (1966) (BLACK, J., concurring and dissenting).*\n\n\n39\nJustice STEWART, with whom Justice REHNQUIST joins, dissenting.\n\n\n40\nIn East Carroll Parish School Bd. v. Marshall, 424 U.S. 636, 638-639, n.6, 96 S.Ct. 1083, 1085, n.6, 47 L.Ed.2d 296, the Court expressly stated that a reapportionment scheme which is submitted and adopted pursuant to a court order does not have to be approved through the preclearance procedures of \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act.  This statement represented the deliberate and considered view of the court, as demonstrated by the presence of a separate opinion in the case questioning the Court's resolution of the issue.  See id., at 640, 96 S.Ct., at 1085 (concurring opinion). Because I believe that what the Court said in the East Carroll case expressly controls the result in this case, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n The Voting Rights Act was enacted in 1965, 79 Stat. 437, and was amended in 1970, 84 Stat. 314, and in 1975, 89 Stat. 400. In relevant part, \u00a7 5, 89 Stat. 404, as set forth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c, now provides:\n\"[W]henever a State or political subdivision with respect to which the prohibitions set forth in section 1973b(a) of this title based upon determinations made under the third sentence of section 1973b(b) of this title are in effect shall enact or seek to administer any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting different from that in force or effect on November 1, 1972, such State or subdivision may institute an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for a declaratory judgment that such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section 1973b(f)(2) of this title, and unless and until the court enters such judgment no person shall be denied the right to vote for failure to comply with such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure:  Provided, That such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure may be enforced without such proceeding if the qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure has been submitted by the chief legal officer or other appropriate official of such State or subdivision to the Attorney General and the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within sixty days after such submission, or upon good cause shown, to facilitate an expedited approval within sixty days after such submission, the Attorney General has affirmatively indicated that such objection will not be made.\"\n\n\n2\n Section 4 of the Act identifies the jurisdictions that are subject to the Act's prohibitions.  One of the determinants of coverage is the use of a \"test or device\" as a prerequisite for registration or voting.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973b(b), (c).  In 1975, Congress enlarged the coverage of the Act by changing the definition of \"test or device\" to protect non-English-speaking citizens who constitute more than 5% of the voting age population in any jurisdiction.  The amendment provides:\n\"In addition to the meaning given the term under subsection (c) of this section, the term 'test or device' shall also mean any practice or requirement by which any State or political subdivision provided any registration or voting notices, forms, instructions, assistance, or other materials or information relating to the electoral process, including ballots, only in the English language, where the Director of the Census determines that more than five per centum of the citizens of voting age residing in such State or political subdivision are members of a single language minority.\"  89 Stat. 401-402, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973b(f)(3).\nAs a result of this amendment, Texas and its political subdivisions became covered jurisdictions.  See Briscoe v. Bell, 432 U.S. 404, 97 S.Ct. 2428, 53 L.Ed.2d 439.\n\n\n3\n See generally Tex.Const., Art. 5, \u00a7 18; Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann., Art. 2351 (Vernon 1971).  Elections are staggered in the four precincts so that two commissioners are elected every two years.\n\n\n4\n The District Court certified two classes of Kleberg County voters as plaintiffs:  (1) the class of all registered voters who were denied a vote of equal weight in the election of county commissioners due to the malapportionment of the commissioners' precincts;  and (2) the class of all Mexican-American voters whose voting power had been diluted under the Kleberg County apportionment plan.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. A-2, A-4.\n\n\n5\n In February 1978, the District Court had refused to grant the plaintiffs preliminary relief enjoining the May 1978 primary elections, relying in part on the uncertainty of the statistical data presented by the plaintiffs to establish their claim of malapportionment.  After the primary election, the Court of Appeals vacated the District Court's order denying a preliminary injunction and remanded for reconsideration in the light of its decision in Lister v. Commissioners Court, 566 F.2d 490 (5 Cir. 1978), which held that a Commissioners Court \"had a clear duty to reapportion on the basis of the 1970 Census.\"  Id., at 492.  Upon remand, the case proceeded to trial in the District Court.\n\n\n6\n The 1970 census indicated that Kleberg County had 33,166 residents.  If the precinct boundaries had been drawn to achieve perfect population equality, each precinct would have had 8,291 residents.  In fact, however, the largest precinct contained 9,928 residents and the smallest only 6,702.  The maximum deviation from the largest precinct to the smallest was therefore 38.9%.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. A-5.  This apportionment plan had been adopted in 1968, and the precincts had not been reapportioned following the 1970 census.\n\n\n7\n In ordering the defendants to submit a proposed reapportionment plan, the District Court noted:  \"The initial burden of fashioning a constitutionally permissible remedy is on the County Commissioners Court.\"  Id., at A-19.\n\n\n8\n Although the Commissioners Court employed Dr. Nash, he was not given extensive instructions with respect to preparation of the reapportionment plan.  Dr. Nash's testimony in the District Court reveals that the plan's details were left largely within his discretion:\n\"Q. What instructions did you receive at the time of notification from Judge McDaniel in reference to drafting the new plan?\n*          *          *          *          *\n\"A. They wanted it broken down on a one-person\/one-vote basis and that was the extent of their input on how I would do it.\" App. 25.\nThe Commissioners Court did not ask Dr. Nash to take into consideration geographical boundaries, previous county maintenance districts, or the ethnic balance of individual precincts.  Id., at 26.  In drafting the plan, Dr. Nash was primarily influenced by population considerations;  he also attempted to stay within the boundaries of existing voting precincts as much as possible.  Id., at 29-30.\n\n\n9\n After Dr. Nash submitted his proposal, the Commissioners Court asked him to redraw one boundary in order to locate the county courthouse in Precinct One instead of Precinct Four. Because there were no residents on the only block affected by this change, see id., at 28, no one contends that it was significant for purposes of this litigation.\n\n\n10\n See n. 1, supra.\n\n\n11\n As Justice POWELL noted in granting petitioners' application for a stay:\n\"It is fair to say that the opinions in East Carroll and Wise v. Lipscomb fall considerably short of providing clear guidance to the courts that initially address this difficult issue.  It would be helpful, therefore, for this Court to exercise its responsibility to provide such guidance.\"  448 U.S., at 1322, 101 S.Ct., at 9.\n\n\n12\n Pet. for Cert. I;  see also Brief for Petitioners II.\n\n\n13\n See n. 2, supra.\n\n\n14\n In our prior decisions construing the Act, we have described in detail the preclearance procedures.  See, e. g., Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 89 S.Ct. 817, 22 L.Ed.2d 1;  South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 86 S.Ct. 803, 15 L.Ed.2d 769;  Georgia v. United States, 411 U.S. 526, 93 S.Ct. 1702, 36 L.Ed.2d 472;  Morris v. Gressette, 432 U.S. 491, 97 S.Ct. 2411, 53 L.Ed.2d 506.\n\n\n15\n In Johnson, the Court summarily rejected the suggestion that an apportionment plan formulated by a federal court must be submitted for preclearance under \u00a7 5:\n\"A decree of the United States District Court is not within reach of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.\"  402 U.S., at 691, 91 S.Ct., at 1761.\nIn his dissenting opinion in Johnson, Justice Black added:\n\"Needless to say I completely agree with the holding of the majority that a reapportionment plan formulated and ordered by a federal district court need not be approved by the United States Attorney General or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  Under our constitutional system it would be strange indeed to construe \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 439, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c (1964 ed., Supp. V), to require that actions of a federal court be stayed and reviewed by the Attorney General or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.\"  Id., at 695, 91 S.Ct., at 1763.\n\n\n16\n Chapman involved reapportionment of the Legislature of North Dakota, a jurisdiction that is not covered by the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\n17\n See Zimmer v. McKeithen, 467 F.2d 1381 (CA5 1972).\n\n\n18\n See Zimmer v. McKeithen, 485 F.2d 1297 (CA5 1973) (en banc).  In the Court of Appeals, the appellants had also argued that the at-large election was not permitted by state law because the Louisiana statute that authorized the use of multimember districts had never become effective since it had not been precleared pursuant to \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act.  See 485 F.2d, at 1301-1302, and n. 7.\n\n\n19\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE, in his concurring opinion in East Carroll, pointed out that the Court's discussion of the preclearance issue was dictum:\n\"I consider it unnecessary to reach the question discussed, ante [424 U.S.,] at 638-639, n. 6 [96 S.Ct., at 1085, n. 6.]  It was, as the Court observes in n. 6, 'not raised by the petitioners, nor did respondent file a cross-petition.'  The scope of \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act is an important matter, and I would not undertake to express any view on what the Court discusses by way of dicta in n. 6.\"  424 U.S., at 640, 96 S.Ct., at 1085.\nTo the extent that the dictum in the East Carroll footnote is inconsistent with our holding today, that dictum is disavowed.\n\n\n20\n Justice WHITE explained why East Carroll did not support the judgment of the Court of Appeals:\n\"[W]e emphasized [in East Carroll ] that the bodies which submitted the plans did not purport to reapportion themselves and, furthermore, could not even legally do so under federal law because state legislation providing them with such powers had been disapproved by the Attorney General of the United States under \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  424 U.S., at 638 n. 6, 637 n. 2, 96 S.Ct., at 1085 n. 6, 1084 n. 2.  Under these circumstances, it was concluded that the mere act of submitting a plan was not the equivalent of a legislative Act of reapportionment performed in accordance with the political processes of the community in question.\"  437 U.S., at 545, 98 S.Ct., at 2500.\n\n\n21\n The District Court in Burns, after striking down Hawaii's Senate apportionment scheme, directed the legislature to enact a proposed interim plan pending the constitutional amendment required for reapportionment under Hawaii law.  See 384 U.S., at 80-81, 86 S.Ct., at 1290-1291.  The legislature complied with the court's order, but the court found the proposed interim plan unacceptable.  On appeal, this Court treated the proposed plan as a legislative plan, despite the fact that the Hawaii Legislature was without power to reapportion itself absent a constitutional amendment.\n\n\n22\n Justice POWELL's opinion made it plain that the crucial factor was the legislature's exercise of its judgment, not its legislative power:\n\"The essential point is that the Dallas City Council exercised a legislative judgment, reflecting the policy choices of the elected representatives of the people, rather than the remedial directive of a federal court. . . .  Th[e] rule of deference to local legislative judgments remains in force even if, as in Burns, our examination of state law suggests that the local body lacks authority to reapportion itself.\"  437 U.S., at 548, 98 S.Ct., at 2501.\n\n\n23\n In reaching this conclusion, Justice POWELL read East Carroll \"as turning on its peculiar facts\":\n\"Because the brief per curiam in East Carroll did not even cite Burns, I would read it as turning on its peculiar facts.  In response to the litigation in East Carroll, the legislature enacted a statute enabling police juries and school boards to reapportion themselves by employing at-large elections.  That enabling legislation was disapproved by the Attorney General of the United States under \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, . . . because of its impermissible impact on Negro voters.  This determination meant that the specific plans proposed by the school board and police jury in that case would have had unlawful effects.  Because their legislative judgment had been found tainted in that respect, it followed that the normal presumption of legitimacy afforded the balances reflected in legislative plans . . . could not be indulged.  To the extent that East Carroll implies anything further about the principle established in Burns, the latter must be held to control.\"  437 U.S., at 549, 98 S.Ct., at 2502.\n\n\n24\n At the outset of his opinion, Justice MARSHALL summarized his position:\n\"I agree with the majority's decision not to reach the Voting Rights Act question, since it was not presented to either of the courts below.  I also agree with the analysis of our past decisions found in Part II of Mr. Justice WHITE's opinion.  I cannot agree, however, that the actions of the Dallas City Council are distinguishable from those of the local governing body in East Carroll Parish School Bd. v. Marshall, 424 U.S. 636, 96 S.Ct. 1083, 47 L.Ed.2d 296 (1976).  I therefore conclude that the plan ordered by the District Court here must be evaluated in accordance with the federal common law of remedies applicable to judicially devised reapportionment plans.\"  Id., at 550, 98 S.Ct., at 2502.\nIn his opinion announcing the judgment of the Court, Justice WHITE pointed out that Texas had not been subject to the Voting Rights Act when the case was pending in the District Court.  Id., at 542, 98 S.Ct., at 2498.  Justice POWELL, also agreed with the decision not to address the Voting Rights Act.  Id., at 549, 98 S.Ct., at 2502.\n\n\n25\n Because the 1975 extension of the Voting Rights Act is the controlling statute in this case, the legislative history of that extension is of particular relevance.  See Dougherty County Board of Education v. White, 439 U.S. 32, 46, 99 S.Ct. 368, 376, 58 L.Ed.2d 269.\n\n\n26\n The Senate Report emphasized the importance of the preclearance procedure:\n\"The provisions of S. 1279 propose to amend the Act so that the special remedies, including Section 5 preclearance, will be operative for an additional ten years.  Although the 1965 legislation and the 1970 amendments did, in large part, provide for only five year coverage periods at a time, the Committee concludes that it is imperative that a ten year extension now be adopted in order to insure the applicability of Section 5 protections during the reapportionment and redistricting which will take place subsequent to the 1980 Decennial Census.\n\"Approximately one-third of the Justice Department's objections have been to redistrictings at the state, county and city levels.  (S. Hearings 539-540, 581-582).  This past experience ought not be ignored in terms of assessing the future need for the Act.  It is ironic that the Supreme Court's 'one man-one vote' ruling [Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964)] has created opportunities to disfranchise minority voters.  Having to redraft district lines in compliance with that ruling, jurisdictions may not always take care to void discriminating against minority voters in that process.  By providing that Section 5 protections not be removed before 1985, S. 1279 would guarantee Federal protection of minority voting rights during the years that the post-census redistrictings will take place.\"  S.Rep. No. 94-295, pp. 17-18 (1975) (footnote omitted) (Senate Report).\n\n\n27\n Id., at 18.\n\n\n28\n The Committee went on to state that, in its judgment, \u00a7 5 had been properly applied by the District Court in Gaillard v. Young, No. 74-1265 (SC 1975).  In Gaillard, the District Court invalidated an existing apportionment plan and directed that any remedial plan proposed by the parties be precleared by the Attorney General before it would be embodied in a final decree. Senate Report, at 19.  In their brief in this case, petitioners conceded that Gaillard \"involved facts identical to those in this case.\"  Brief for Petitioners 25.\n\n\n29\n See, e. g., South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 86 S.Ct. 803, 15 L.Ed.2d 769;  Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U.S. 544, 89 S.Ct. 817, 22 L.Ed.2d 1.\n\n\n30\n Moreover, even after a federal court has found a districting plan unconstitutional, \"redistricting and reapportioning legislative bodies is a legislative task which the federal courts should make every effort not to pre-empt.\"  Wise v. Lipscomb, 437 U.S., at 539, 98 S.Ct., at 2496 (opinion of WHITE, J.)  See also Chapman v. Meier, 420 U.S. 1, 27, 95 S.Ct. 751, 766, 42 L.Ed.2d 766.  Our prior decisions in the apportionment area indicate that, in the normal case, a court that has invalidated a State's existing appointment plan should enjoin implementation of that plan and give the legislature an opportunity to devise an acceptable replacement before itself undertaking the task of reapportionment.  See, e. g., Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 585-586, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1394, 12 L.Ed.2d 506;  Maryland Committee v. Tawes, 377 U.S. 656, 676, 84 S.Ct. 1429, 1440, 12 L.Ed.2d 595; Davis v. Mann, 377 U.S. 678, 693, 84 S.Ct. 1441, 1449, 12 L.Ed.2d 609;  Ely v. Klahr, 403 U.S. 108, 114, and n.6, 91 S.Ct. 1803, 1807, and n.6, 29 L.Ed.2d 352.  Cf. Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U.S. 735, 749, 93 S.Ct. 2321, 2329, 37 L.Ed.2d 298.  \"[J]udicial relief becomes appropriate only when a legislature fails to reapportion according to federal constitutional requisites in a timely fashion after having had an adequate opportunity to do so.\"  Reynolds, supra, at 586, 84 S.Ct., at 1394;  Burns v. Richardson, 384 U.S., at 85, 86 S.Ct., at 1293.  Thus, in the normal case, the legislature will enact an apportionment plan to replace that invalidated by the court;  such a plan clearly must be precleared under \u00a7 5.  See Connor v. Waller, 421 U.S. 656, 95 S.Ct. 2003, 44 L.Ed.2d 486 (per curiam).\n\n\n31\n Our decision in United States v. Board of Supervisors of Warren County, 429 U.S. 642, 97 S.Ct. 833, 51 L.Ed.2d 106 (per curiam), illustrates that a District Court's conclusion that a reapportionment plan proposed by a covered jurisdiction complies with constitutional requirements is not a substitute for \u00a7 5 review.  In Warren County, the Attorney General filed a \u00a7 5 action in the District Court.  The court enjoined the county from implementing an apportionment plan that had not been precleared under \u00a7 5, and directed it to submit a new plan for preclearance. When the county was unable to obtain the Attorney General's approval for either of two proposed plans, it submitted the plans to the District Court.  The court adopted one of the plans despite the county's failure to obtain the Attorney General's approval, finding that the plan neither diluted minority voting strength nor violated the one-person, one-vote principle.  Id., at 643-644, 97 S.Ct., at 834.  This Court reversed, holding that it was error for the District Court to determine the constitutional validity of the county's plan and to order that it be implemented, rather than limiting its inquiry in the \u00a7 5 suit to the question whether the county had complied with \u00a7 5.\n\n\n32\n For example, in 1976, covered jurisdictions submitted 7,470 proposed changes to the Department of Justice for preclearance under \u00a7 5;  the Department interposed objections to 62 of those submissions.  See Hearings before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, House Committee on the Judiciary, GAO Report on the Voting Rights Act, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., 35-36 (1978) (statement of Drew S. Days III, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division).\n\n\n33\n See also H.R.Rep. No. 94-196, pp. 5, 8-11 (1975); H.R.Rep. No. 91-397, pp. 6-8 (1969).\n\n\n34\n The parties appear to agree that the Commissioners Court had authority under Texas law to redraw the boundaries of the commissioners' precincts.  Petitioners contend, however, that the Commissioners Court was without power to adopt the particular apportionment plan at issue in this case because it is permitted to redraw the boundaries of election precincts only in a July or August term.  The plan in this case was submitted to the District Court in November and was approved by that court in January.  See Tex.Elec.Code Ann., Art. 2.04(1) (Vernon Supp.1980).  Election precincts are subunits of commissioners' precincts that determine where a voter registers and votes.  Because the reapportionment plan submitted by the Commissioners Court resulted in the splitting of several election precincts between two commissioners' precincts, petitioners contend that the plan altered the boundaries of election precincts in violation of state law.  Since we conclude that the Commissioners Court's authority under Texas law to enact this plan is irrelevant for purposes of \u00a7 5 coverage, we need not resolve this question of state law.  At any rate, it is clear that the Commissioners Court possesses general authority to reapportion itself;  petitioners challenge only the timing of the submission and adoption of the plan in this case.\n\n\n35\n Petitioners argue that the interposition of a preclearance requirement will encourage dilatory tactics by incumbents who will continue to represent malapportioned districts during the review process.  The district courts, however, have ample power to fashion interim remedies to avoid problems of this character.\n\n\n*\n In his dissent, Justice Black stated that his \"objection to \u00a7 5 is that [it] . . . conflict[s] with the most basic principles of the Constitution.\"  383 U.S., at 358, 86 S.Ct., at 833. Justice Black added:\n\"Section 5, by providing that some of the States cannot pass state laws or adopt state constitutional amendments without first being compelled to beg federal authorities to approve their policies, so distorts our constitutional structure of government as to render any distinction drawn in the Constitution between state and federal power almost meaningless.  One of the most basic premises upon which our structure of government was founded was that the Federal Government was to have certain specific and limited powers and no others, and all other power was to be reserved either 'to the States respectively, or to the people.' Certainly if all the provisions of our Constitution which limit the power of the Federal Government and reserve other power to the States are to mean anything, they mean at least that the States have power to pass laws and amend their constitutions without first sending their officials hundreds of miles away to beg federal authorities to approve them.\"  Id., at 358-359, 86 S.Ct., at 833-834.\nThe right freely to vote must be safeguarded vigilantly.  If a state law denies or impairs this right, in violation of the Constitution or of a valid federal law, the courts are the proper and traditional forum for redress.\n\n\n","label":1}

Petitioner was convicted in a New York State court in 1951 for possession of narcotics with intent to sell. On December 21, 1950, two detectives attached to the Narcotics Squad of the New York City Police Department entered petitioner's apartment by a door opened by a painter who was just leaving. They ignored the protest of petitioner and proceeded, without a warrant, to search the apartment. Upon entering, one of the officers called an agent of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. After two federal agents arrived the local and federal officers made a thorough search of the apartment. One of the local officers found 54 cellophane envelopes, 106 empty capsules, a box of staples and a scale. A federal agent found four packages under a hat. Analysis revealed that three of the packets contained heroin and the other contained cocaine. These items were introduced in evidence at the state trial without objection of petitioner's counsel. Nor was objection made to the participation of the federal narcotics agents in the investigation. After conviction petitioner filed a notice of appeal to the Appellate Division but the appeal was dismissed in March of 1952.\n\n\n2\nIn August 1961, after Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081, was decided, petitioner resorted to state post-conviction remedies claiming that the evidence found in his apartment and introduced against him had been illegally seized and that his conviction had therefore been obtained in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Upon seeking habeas corpus in the United States District Court on the same grounds his application was denied. The trial judge refused to apply Mapp retrospectively. The Court of Appeals sitting en banc affirmed by a divided vote. 333 F.2d 12. We granted certiorari, 379 U.S. 815, 85 S.Ct. 126, 13 L.Ed.2d 28 (1964), and set this case for argument with Linkletter, supra. That case answers petitioner's point as to the retrospective application of Mapp.\n\n\n3\nHowever, petitioner also contends that the participation of federal narcotics agents in the search and seizure requires reversal here, citing Rea v. United States, 350 U.S. 214, 76 S.Ct. 292, 100 L.Ed. 233 (1956). We cannot agree. That case invoked the supervisory power of a federal court over a federal law enforcement officer and we held that the latter might be enjoined from appearing in a state trial for the purpose of offering evidence previously seized by him illegally as a federal officer and so found by a federal court. But even if an exclusionary rule were fashioned to bar use of the federal agent's testimony in the absence of a federal court restraint, the petitioner would be entitled to no relief. Such an exclusionary rule would depend upon the reasons given in Mapp and under Linkletter, supra, would not have retrospective application.\n\n\n4\nAffirmed.\n\n\n5\nMr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the reasons stated in Mr. Justice BLACK's dissenting opinion in Linkletter v.

Charles A. O'Niell, Jr., and M. A. Grace, both of New Orleans, La., for appellants.\nMr. Arthur A. Moreno, of New Orleans, La., for appellees.\nMr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nLouisiana statutes provide in general that all seagoing vessels moving between New Orleans and foreign ports must be navigated through the Mississippi River approaches to the port of New Orleans and within it, exclusively by pilots who are State Officers.1 New State pilots are appointed by the governor only upon certification of a State Board of River Pilot Commissioners, themselves pilots.2 Only those who have served a six month apprenticeship under incumbent pilots and who possess other \u00a7 ecific qualifications may be certified to the governor by the board.3 Appellants here have had at least fifteen years experience in the river, the port, and else where, as pilots of vessels whose pilotage was not governed by the State law in question.4 Although they possess all the statutory qualifications except that they have not served the requisite six months apprenticeship under Louisiana officer pilots,5 they have been denied appointment as State pilots. Seeking relief in a Louisiana state court, they alleged that the incumbent pilots, having unfettered discretion under the law in the selection of apprentices, had selected with occasional exception, only the relatives and friends of incumbents; that the selections were made by electing prosepective apprentices into the pilots' association, which the pilots have formed by authority of State law;6 that since 'membership * * * is closed to all except those having the favor of the pilots' the result is that only their relatives and friends have and can become State pilots.7 The Supreme Court of Louisiana has held that the pilotage law so administered does not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, 209 La. 737, 25 So.2d 527. The case is here on appeal from that decision under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 344(a), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 344(a).\n\n\n2\nThe constitutional command for a state to afford 'equal protection of the laws' sets a goal not attainable by the invention and application of a precise formula. This Court has never attempted that impossible task. A law which affects the activities of some groups differently from the way in which it affects the activities of other groups is not necessarily banned by the Fourteenth Amendment. See e.g., Tigner v. State of Texas, 310 U.S. 141, 147, 60 S.Ct. 879, 882, 84 L.Ed. 1124, 130 A.L.R. 1321. Otherwise, effective regulation in the public interest could not be provided, however essential that regulation might be. For it is axiomatic that the consequence of regulating by setting apart a classified group is that those in it will be subject to some restrictions or receive certain advantages that do not apply to other groups or to all the public. Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co. v. Matthews, 174 U.S. 96, 106, 19 S.Ct. 609, 613, 43 L.Ed. 909. This selective application of a regulation is discrimination in the broad sense, but it may or may not deny equal protection of the laws. Clearly, it might offend that constitutional safeguard if it rested on grounds wholly irrelevant to achievement of the regulation's objectives. An example would be a law applied to deny a person a right to earn a living or hold any job because of hostility to his particular race, religion, beliefs, or because of any other reason having no rational relation to the regulated activities. See American Sugar Refining Co. v. State of Louisiana, 179 U.S. 89, 92, 21 S.Ct. 43, 45, 45 L.Ed. 102.\n\n\n3\nThe case of Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220, relied on by appellants, is an illustration of a type of discrimination which is incompatible with any fair conception of equal protection of the laws. Yick Wo was denied the right to engage in an occupation supposedly open to all who could conduct their business in accordance with the law's requirements. He could meet these requirements, but was denied the right to do so solely because he was Chinese. And it made no difference that under the law as written Yick Wo would have enjoyed the same protection as all others. Its unequal application to Yick Wo was enough to condemn it. But Yick Wo's case, as other cases have demonstrated, was tested by the language of the law there considered and the administration there shown. Cf. Crowley v. Christensen, 137 U.S. 86, 93, 94, 11 S.Ct. 13, 16, 17, 34 L.Ed. 620; Gundling v. City of Chicago, 177 U.S. 183, 20 S.Ct. 633, 44 L.Ed. 725; People of State of New York ex rel. Lieberman v. Van De Carr, 199 U.S. 552, 26 S.Ct. 144, 50 L.Ed. 305; Engel v. O'Malley, 219 U.S. 128, 137, 31 S.Ct. 190, 192, 55 L.Ed. 128. So here, we must consider the relationship of the method of appointing pilots to the broad objectives of the entire Louisiana pilotage law. See Grainger v. Douglas Park Jockey Club, 6 Cir., 148 F. 513, and cases there cited. In so doing we must view the appointment system in the context of the historical evolution of the laws and institution of pilotage in Louisiana and elsewhere. Cf. Otis Co. v. Ludlow Mfg. Co. 201 U.S. 140, 154, 26 S.Ct. 353, 355, 50 L.Ed. 696; Jackman v. Rosenbaum, 260 U.S. 22, 31, 43 S.Ct. 9, 10, 67 L.Ed. 107; Bayside Fish Flour Co. v. Gentry, 297 U.S. 422, 428 430, 56 S.Ct. 513, 515\u2014517, 80 L.Ed. 388. And an important factor in our consideration is that this case tests the right and power of a state to select its own agents and officers. Taylor v. Beckham, 178 U.S. 548, 20 S.Ct. 1009, 44 L.Ed. 1187; Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 11\u201413, 64 S.Ct. 397, 402\u2014404, 88 L.Ed. 497.\n\n\n4\nStudies of the long history of pilotage reveal that it is a unique institution and must be judged as such.8 In order to avoid invisible hazards, vessels approaching and leaving ports must be conducted from and to open waters by persons intimately familiar with the local waters. The pilot's job generally requires that he go outside the harbor's entrance in a small boat to meet incoming ships, board them and direct their course from open waters to the port. The same service is performed for vessels leaving the port. Pilots are thus indispensable cogs in the transportation system of every maritime economy. Their work prevents traffic congestion and accidents which would impair navigation in and to the ports. It affects the safety of lives and cargo, the cost and time expended in port calls, and in some measure, the competitive attractiveness of particular ports. Thus, for the same reasons that governments of most maritime communities have subsidized, regulated, or have themselves operated docks and other harbor facilities and sought to improve the approaches to their ports, they have closely regulated and often operated their ports' pilotage system.9\n\n\n5\nThe history and practice of pilotage demonstrate that, although inextricably geared to a complex commercial economy, it is also a highly personalized calling.10 A pilot does not require a formalized technical education so much as a detailed and extremely intimate, almost intuitive, knowledge of the weather, waterways and conformation of the harbor or river which he serves. This seems to be particularly true of the approaches to New Orleans through the treacherous and shifting channel of the Mississippi River.11 Moreover, harbor entrances where pilots can most conveniently make their homes and still be close to places where they board incoming and leave outgoing ships are usually some distance from the port cities they serve.12 These 'pilot towns' have begun, and generally exist today, as small communities of pilots perhaps near, but usually distinct from the port cities.13 In these communities young men have an opportunity to acquire special knowledge of the weather and water hazards of the locality and seem to grow up with ambitions to become pilots in the traditions of their fathers, relatives, and neighbors.14 We are asked, in effect, to say that Louisiana is without constitutional authority to conclude that apprenticeship under persons specially interested in a pilot's future is the best way to fit him for duty as a pilot officer in the service of the State.\n\n\n6\nThe States have had full power to regulate pilotage of certain kinds of vessels since 1789 when the first Congress decided that then existing state pilot laws were satisfactory and made federal regulation unnecessary. 1 Stat. 53, 54 (1789), 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 211, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 211; Olsen v. Smith, 195 U.S. 332, 341, 25 S.Ct. 52, 53, 49 L.Ed. 224; Anderson v. Pacific Coast S.S. Co., 225 U.S. 187, 32 S.Ct. 626, 56 L.Ed. 1047. Louisiana legislation has controlled the activities and appointment of pilots since 1805\u2014even before the Territory was admitted as a State.15 The State pilotage system, as it has evolved since 1805, is typical of that which grew up in most seaboard states and in foreign countries.16 Since 1805 Louisiana pilots have been State officers whose work has been controlled by the State.17 That Act forbade all but a limited number of pilots appointed by the governor to serve in that capacity. The pilots so appointed were authorized to select their own deputies.18 But pilots, and through them, their deputies, were literally under the command of the master and the wardens of the port of New Orleans, appointed by the governor. The master and wardens were authorized to make rules governing the practices of pilots, specifically empowered to order pilots to their stations, and to fine them for disobedience to orders or rules. And the pilots were required to make official bond for faithful performance of their duty. Pilots' fees were fixed;19 ships coming to the Mississippi were required to pay pilotage whether they took on pilots or not.20 The pilots were authorized to organize an association whose membership they controlled in order 'to enforce the legal regulations, and add to the efficiency of the service required thereby.'21 Moreover, efficient and adequate service was sought to be insured by requiring the Board of Pilot Commissioners to report to the governor and authorizing him simmarily to remove any pilot guilty of 'neglect of duty, habitual intemperance, carelessness, incompetency, or any act of conduct * * * showing' that he 'ought to be removed.' La.Act. No. 113, \u00a7 20 (1857). These provisions have been carried over with some revision into the present comprehensive Louisiana pilotage law. 6 La.Gen.Stat., cc. 6, 8 (1939). Thus in Louisiana, as elsewhere, it seems to have been accepted at an early date that in pilotage, unlike other occupations, competition for appointment, for the opportunity to serve particular ships and for fees, adversely affects the public interest in pilotage.22\n\n\n7\nIt is within the framework of this longstanding pilotage regulation system that the practice has apparently existed of permitting pilots, if they choose, to select their relatives and friends as the only ones ultimately eligible for appointment as pilots by the governor. Many other states have established pilotage systems which make the selection of pilots on this basis possible.23 Thus it was noted thirty years ago in a Department of Commerce study of pilotage that membership of pilot associations 'is limited to persons agreeable to those already members, generally relatives and friends of the pilots. Probably in pilotage more than in any other occupation in the United States the male members of a family follow the same work from generation to generation.'24\n\n\n8\nThe practice of nepotism in appointing public servants has been a subject of controversy in this country throughout our history. Some states have adopted constitutional amendments25 or statutes,26 to prohibit it. These have reflected state policies to wipe out the practice. But Louisiana and most other states have adopted no such general policy. We can only assume that the Louisiana legislature weighed the obvious possibility of evil against whatever useful function a closely knit pilotage system may serve. Thus the advantages of early experience under friendly supervision in the locality of the pilot's training, the benefits to morale and esprit de corps which family and neighborly tradition might contribute, the close association in which pilots must work and live in their pilot communities and on the water, and the discipline and regulation which is imposed to assure the State competent pilot service after appointment, might have prompted the legislature to permit Louisiana pilot officers to select those which whom they would serve.\n\n\n9\nThe number of people, as a practical matter, who can be pilots is very limited. No matter what system of selection is adopted, all but the few occasionally selected must of necessity be excluded. Cf. Olsen v. Smith, supra, 195 U.S. at pages 344, 345, 25 S.Ct. at pages 54, 55, 49 L.Ed. 224.27 We are aware of no decision of this Court holding that the Constitution requires a state governor, or subordinates responsible to him and removable by him for cause, to select state public servants by competitive tests or by any other particular method of selection. The object of the entire pilotage law, as we have pointed out, is to secure for the State and others interested the safest and most efficiently operated pilotage system practicable. We cannot say that the method adopted in Louisiana for the selection of pilots is unrelated to this objective. See Olsen v. Smith, supra; cf. Carmichael v. Southern Coal Co., 301 U.S. 495, 509, 510, 57 S.Ct. 868, 872, 873, 81 L.Ed. 1245, 109 A.L.R. 1327. We do not need to consider hypothetical questions concerning any similar system of selection which might conceivably be practiced in other professions or businesses regulated or operated by state governments. It is enough here that considering the entirely unique institution of pilotage in the light of its history in Louisiana, we cannot say that the practice appellants attack is the kind of discrimination which violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n10\nAffirmed.\n\n\n11\nMr. Justice RUTLEDGE, dissenting.\n\n\n12\nThe unique history and conditions surrounding the activities of river port pilots, shortly recounted in the Court's opinion, justify a high degree of public regulation. But I do not think they can sustain a system of entailment for the occupation. If Louisiana were to provide by statute in haec verba that only members of John Smith's family would be eligible for the public calling of pilot, I have no doubt that the statute on its face would infringe the Fourteenth Amendment. And this would be true, even though John Smith and the members of his family had been pilots for generations. It would be true also if the right were expanded to include a number of designated families.\n\n\n13\nIn final analysis this is, I think, the situation presented on this record. While the statutes applicable do not purport on their face to restrict the right to become a licensed pilot to members of the families of licensed pilots, the charge is that they have been so administered. And this charge not only is borne out by the record but is accepted by the Court as having been sustained.1\n\n\n14\nThe result of the decision therefore is to approve as constitutional state regulation which makes admission to the ranks of pilots turn finally on consanguinity. Blood is, in effect, made the crux of selection. That, in my opinion, is forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment's guaranty against denial of the equal protection of the laws. The door is thereby closed to all not having blood relationship to presently licensed pilots. Whether the occupation is considered as having the status of 'public officer' or of highly regulated private employment, it is beyond legislative power to make entrance to it turn upon such a criterion. The Amendment makes no exception from its prohibitions against state action on account of the fact that public rather than private employment is affected by the forbidden discriminations. That fact simply makes violation all the more clear where those discriminations are shown to exist.\n\n\n15\nIt is not enough to avoid the Amendment's force that a familial system may have a tendency or, as the Court puts it, a direct relationship to the end of securing an efficient pilotage system. Classification based on the purpose to be accomplished may be said abstractly to be sound. But when the test adopted and applied in fact is race or consanguinity, it cannot be used constitutionally to bar all except a group chosen by such a relationship from public employment. That is not a test; it is a wholly arbitrary exercise of power.\n\n\n16\nConceivably the familial system would be the most effective possible scheme for training many kinds of artisans or public servans, sheerly from the viewpoint of securing the highest degree of skill and competence. Indeed, something very worth while largely disappeared from our national life when the once prevalent familial system of conducting manufacturing and mercantile enterprises went out and was replaced by the highly impersonal corporate system for doing business.\n\n\n17\nBut that loss is not one to be repaired under our scheme by legislation framed or administered to perpetuate family monopolies of either private occupations or branches of the public service. It is precisely because the Amendment forbids enclosing those areas by legislative lines drawn on the basis of race, color, creed, and the like, that, in cases like this, the possibly most efficient method of securing the highest development of skills cannot be established by law. Absent any such bar, the presence of such a tendency or direct relationship would be effective for sustaining the legislation. It cannot be effective to overcome the bar itself. The discrimination here is not shown to be consciously racial in character. But I am unable to differentiate in effects one founded on blood relationship.\n\n\n18\nThe case therefore falls squarely within the ruling in Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220,2 not only with relation to the line of discrimination employed, but also in the fact that unconstitutional administration of a statute otherwise valid on its face incurs the same condemnation as if the statute had incorporated the discrimination in terms. Appellants here are entitled, in my judgment, to the same relief as was afforded in the Yick Wo case.\n\n\n19\nMr. Justice REED, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MURPHY join in this dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n A ship entering the Mississippi River from the Gulf of Mexico is piloted the twenty mile distance from the mouth of the river to 'pilot town' by one of a group of pilots specially familiar with the 'entrance' to the Mississippi through the so-called 'passes.' La.Acts 1880, No. 99, \u00a7 2, La.Acts 1908, No. 55, \u00a7 1; La.Acts 1910, No. 26, \u00a7 1, 6 La.Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 9141, 9163 (1939). Between pilot town and New Orleans, a distance of approximately ninety miles, ships are piloted exclusively by so-called river port pilots. La.Acts 1908, No. 54, \u00a7 1, 6 La.Gen.Stat. c. 8 (1939). By an amendment in 1942 the exclusive jurisdiction of the river port pilots was extended to the piloting of seagoing vessels within the port of New Orleans. La.Acts 1942, No. 134, 6 La.Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 9155, 9156 (Supp.1946). Appellants here sought appointment as river port pilots.\n\n\n2\n Sections 2 and 3 of the Act of 1908 provided for the appointment and commissioning of twenty-eight pilots by the governor and prescribed that thereafter there should not be less than twenty. 6 La.Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 9155, 9156 (1939).\nThe statement of the Louisiana court in this case that pilots so appointed are considered State officers has long been the established State rule. Williams v. Payson, 1859, 14 La.Ann. 7, 8; State of Louisiana v. Follet, 1881, 33 La.Ann. 228, 230; Levine v. Michel, 1883, 35 La.Ann. 1121, 1124.\nFrom among the pilots the governor was required to appoint three River Port Pilot Commissioners. La.Acts 1908, No. 54, \u00a7 1, 6 La.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 9154 (1939).\n\n\n3\n 'Whenever there exists a necessity for more pilots * * * the * * * Board of River Port Pilot Commissioners shall hold examinations, under such rules and regulations, and with such requirements as they shall have provided, with the Governor's approval, provided that no applicant shall be considered by said Board, unless he submits proper evidence of moral character and is a voter of this State, and shall have served six months' apprenticeship in his proposed calling, and upon the certificate of the Board to the Governor that the applicant has complied with the provisions of this act, the Governor may, in his discretion, appoint to existing vacancies.' La.Acts 1908, No. 54, \u00a7 4. 6 La.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 9157 (1939).\n\n\n4\n Appellants were licensed to pilot coastwise vessels to and through the port under federal law which excludes states from controlling pilotage of coastal shipping. Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 4401, 4444, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 364, 215, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 364, 215. Also prior to the passage of La.Acts 1942, No. 134, they had piloted all classes of vessels within the port of New Orleans. That Act deprived appellants of authority to pilot within the port and conferred it exclusively upon State river port pilots. Thus appellants allege they have been deprived of an opportunity to make a living unless they can obtain appointment as river port pilots under the pilotage law.\n\n\n5\n While the Act does not specifically require that the apprenticeships be performed uner incumbent officer pilots, the State Supreme Court has so construed it.\n\n\n6\n La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 2707 (1869), reenacted in \u00a7 4 of La.Acts 1928, No. 198, 6 La.Gen.Stats. \u00a7 9149 (1939).\n\n\n7\n Appellants' complaint was dismissed for failure to state a cause of action. Therefore we consider their allegations as facts for the purpose of this decision.\nAppellants' prayer had sought an injunction against interference with their serving as pilots, and, in the alternative, sought mandamus to compel the Board to examine appellants as required by law and to certify them to the Governor. The Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's refusal to compel the board to examine appellants because they did not possess the qualifications required to take examinations specifically, they had not served apprenticeships.\n\n\n8\n See generally, Report of Departmental Committee on Pilotage (London, 1911); Pilotage in the United States Special Agents Series, Department of Commerce (1917).\n\n\n9\n See Cooley v.

But \u00a7 1 of La.Acts 1806, No. 26, gave pilots blanket authority to app int their own deputies. Pilots were, however, made responsible for the neglect or misconduct of their deputies.\n\n\n19\n La.Acts 1805, c. 24, \u00a7 20; La.Acts 1837, No. 106, \u00a7 9.\n\n\n20\n La.Acts 1805, c. 24, \u00a7 17.\n\n\n21\n Levin v.

This is generally true today. See n. 23 infra.\nThe Department of Commerce Report, supra note 8 at 28 observed that: 'The formation of pilots' associations was largely a result of the intense competition that formerly prevailed among the pilots, * * *. Little efforts was made to maintain definite pilot stations. Instead, the desire to be the first to speak a ship frequently led the pilots to cruise great distances from the port.\n'One of the unfortunate results of the intense competition of pilots was the fact that frequently pilots could not be had when wanted, although they might be far out to sea in quest of business. Another drawback was that pilots unnecessarily exposed themselves to danger. And a third important disadvantage was that it made the earnings precarious; a pilot might earn a great deal this month and very little the next. * * *\nThe pilots themselves were the first to see the disadvantages of the free of competitive system and to take steps toward the organization of associations. These associations soon developed into strong working combinations that eliminated competition and placed on an amicable basis matters that formerly produced much sharp rivalry.\n'From the evidence at hand it would appear that the shipping interests as well as the insurance and commercial interests of the ports encouraged the pilots in the formation of these associations. The advantages of a well-organized pilotage system were as apparent to these interests as to the pilots themselves, for the commerce of the port was not only facilitated and expedited but made much safer by reason of the better organization of the pilotage system, which came with the elimination of competition.\n'Since associations have been formed along the present lines pilotage grounds have been established. * * * These grounds are well known to mariners, who may safely count on finding there at practically all times and in all conditions of weather a pilot boat with a sufficient number of pilots aboard to accommodate any reasonable number of vessels that may come. There is little chance nowadays that a vessel will fail to find a pilot when needed. * * *\n'Still another advantage of the present organization of pilotage systems is that it permits the maintenance of a central office which is in constant touch with the pilot boat and arranges for the rotation of pilots. The association generally employs an agent to look after the routine business of the office.'\n\n\n23\n See N.J.Laws. 1898, c. 31, N.J.Stat.Ann. Title 12, c. 8 (1938); Pa.P.L. 542 of 1803, Pa.Stats.Ann. (Purdon) Title 55, c. 2 (1930); Md.Ann.Code (Flack), Art. 74 (1939); Del.Rev.Code, c. 35 (1935); Va.Code, c. 142 (1942); Ala.

Smith, the constitutionality of a Texas statute, Vernon's Ann.Civ.St. Art. 8264 et seq., forbidding all but pilots appointed by the governor to serve was challenged by one who had not been appointed and had been enjoined from serving as a pilot. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, supra, was relied on as authority for a contention that he had been denied rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment including equal protection of the laws. Id., 195 U.S. at page 334, 25 S.Ct. 52, 49 L.Ed. 224. But this Court in sustaining the constitutionality of the statute, did not specifically discuss the question here raised. Therefore we do not depend upon Olsen v. Smith as a necessarily controlling authority for our decision here.\n\n\n1\n The record shows that a in a few instances over a course of several years nonrelatives of licensed pilots have received appointment as apprentices and qualified. But the general course of administration has been that such appointments are limited to relatives.\n\n\n2\n To like effect is Alston v.

{"text":"453 U.S. 156\n101 S.Ct. 2698\n69 L.Ed.2d 548\nJohn F. LEHMAN, Secretary of the Navy, Petitioner,v.Alice NAKSHIAN.\nNo. 81-242.\nArgued March 31, 1981.\nDecided June 26, 1981.\n\n\nSyllabus\n\nThe Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA or Act) was amended in 1974 to extend to federal employees the Act's protection of older workers against discrimination in the workplace based on age.  Section 15(c) of the Act provides that any aggrieved federal employee \"may bring a civil action in any Federal district court of competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes\" of the Act. Respondent federal employee brought suit in Federal District Court against the Secretary of the Navy under \u00a7 15(c), alleging violations of the Act and demanding a jury trial.  The District Court ruled, over the Secretary's objection, that respondent was entitled to a jury trial.  On an interlocutory appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed.\nHeld :  Respondent was not entitled to a jury trial. Pp. 160-169.\n(a) Where Congress waives the Government's immunity from suit, as it has in the ADEA, the plaintiff has a right to a trial by jury only where Congress has affirmatively and unambiguously granted that right by statute.  Pp. 160-161.\n(b) Congress has not done so here.  Neither the provision in \u00a7 15(c) for federal employer cases to be brought in Federal district courts rather than the Court of Claims, nor the use of the word \"legal\" in that section, evinces a congressional intent that ADEA plaintiffs who proceed to trial against the Federal Government may do so before a jury.  Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40, distinguished.  Section 15(c) contrasts with \u00a7 7(c) of the Act, which expressly provides for jury trials in actions against private employers and state and local governments.  Moreover, in extending the Act to cover federal employees, Congress based the provision not on the Fair Labor Standards Act as was \u00a7 7, but on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, where, unlike the FLSA, there was no right to trial by jury.  Pp. 162-165.\n(c) The legislative history no more supports a holding that respondent has a right to a jury trial than does the statutory language itself.  Pp. 165-168.\n202 U.S.App.D.C. 59, 628 F.2d 59, reversed.\nEdwin S. Kneedler, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nPatricia J. Barry, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nJustice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe question presented by this case is whether a plaintiff in an action against the United States under \u00a7 15(c) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act is entitled to trial by jury.\n\n\n2\n* The 1974 amendments to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 19671 added a new \u00a7 15,2 which brought the Federal Government within the scope of the Act for the first time. Section 15(a)3 prohibits the Federal Government from discrimination based on age in most of its civilian employment decisions concerning persons over 40 years of age.  Section 15(b)4 provides that enforcement of \u00a7 15(a) in most agencies, including military departments, is the responsibility of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The Commission is directed to \"issue such rules, regulations, orders and instructions as [the Commission] deems necessary and appropriate\" to carry out that responsibility.  Section 15(c)5 provides:\n\n\n3\n\"Any person aggrieved may bring a civil action in any      Federal district court of competent jurisdiction for such      legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes of      this Act.\"  88 Stat. 75.\n\n\n4\nIn 1978, respondent Alice Nakshian, who was then a 62-year-old civilian employee of the United States Department of the Navy, brought an age discrimination suit against the Navy under \u00a7 15(c).  She requested a jury trial.  The defendant moved to strike the request, and the District Court denied the motion. Nakshian v. Claytor, 481 F.Supp. 159 (DC).  The court stressed that the \"legal or equitable relief\" language used by Congress to establish a right to sue the Federal Government for age discrimination was identical to the language Congress had previously used in \u00a7 7(c) of the Act6 to authorize private ADEA suits.  That language, the District Court said, was an important basis for this Court's holding in Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40, that \u00a7 7(c) permits jury trials in private suits under the Act.  The court stated that \"if Congress had intended its consent to ADEA suits [against the Government] to be limited to non-jury trials, it could have easily said as much.\"  481 F.Supp., at 161.  Recognizing that as a result of 1978 amendments to the ADEA \u00a7 7(c)(2) expressly confers a right to jury trial, whereas no such language exists in \u00a7 15,7 481 F.Supp., at 161, the court found no \"explicit refusal\" by Congress to grant the right to jury trial against the Government, and noted that the legislative history of the 1978 amendments spoke in general terms about a right to jury trial in ADEA suits.\n\n\n5\nOn interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed, Nakshian v. Claytor, 202 U.S.App.D.C. 59, 628 F.2d 59.  The appellate court rejected the Secretary's argument that a plaintiff is entitled to trial by jury in a suit against the United States only when such a trial has been expressly authorized.  Instead, the court viewed the question as \"an ordinary question of statutory interpretation,\" and found sufficient evidence of legislative intent to provide for trial by jury in cases such as this.  Noting that Congress had conferred jurisdiction over ADEA suits upon the federal district courts, rather than the Court of Claims, the Court of Appeals concluded that \" 'absent a provision as to the method of trial, a grant of jurisdiction to a district court as a court of law carries with it a right of jury trial.' \"  Id., at 63, 628 F.2d, at 63 (quoting 5 J. Moore, J. Lucas, & J. Wicker, Moore's Federal Practice \u00b6 38.32[2], p. 38-236 (1979) (footnotes omitted).  The Court of Appeals also adopted the District Court's view of the \"legal . . . relief\" language in \u00a7 15(c).  Further, it was the court's view that the existence of the explicit statutory right to jury trial in suits against private employers does not negate the existence of a right to jury trial in suits against the Government, since the provision for jury trials in private suits was added only to resolve a conflict in the Court of Appeals on that issue and to confirm the correctness of this Court's decision in the Lorillard case.\n\n\n6\nWe granted certiorari to consider the issue presented.  Sub nom. Hidalgo v. Nakshian, 449 U.S. 1009, 101 S.Ct. 563, 66 L.Ed.2d 467.\n\nII\n\n7\nIt has long been settled that the Seventh Amendment right to trial by jury does not apply in actions against the Federal Government.  In Galloway v. United States, 319 U.S. 372, 388-389, 63 S.Ct. 1077, 1086, 87 L.Ed. 1458, the Court observed (footnotes omitted):\n\n\n8\n\"The suit is one to enforce a monetary claim against the      United States.  It hardly can be maintained that under the      common law in 1791 jury trial was a matter of right for      persons asserting claims against the sovereign.  Whatever      force the Amendment has therefore is derived because      Congress, in the legislation cited, has made it applicable.\"\n\n\n9\nSee also Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 572, 82 S.Ct. 1459, 1484, 8 L.Ed.2d 671, McElrath v. United States, 102 U.S. 426, 440, 26 L.Ed. 189.  Moreover, the Court has recognized the general principle that \"the United States, as sovereign, 'is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued . . . and the terms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court's jurisdiction to entertain the suit.' \"  United States v. Testan, 424 U.S. 392, 399, 96 S.Ct. 948, 953, 47 L.Ed.2d 114;  quoting United States v. Sherwood, 312 U.S. 584, 586, 61 S.Ct. 767, 769, 85 L.Ed. 1058.  See also United States v. Mitchell, 445 U.S. 535, 538, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 1352, 63 L.Ed.2d 607.  Thus, if Congress waives the Government's immunity from suit, as it has in the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a (1976 ed. and Supp. III), the plaintiff has a right to a trial by jury only where that right is one of \"the terms of [the Government's] consent to be sued.\"  Testan, supra, at 399, 96 S.Ct., at 953.  Like a waiver of immunity itself, which must be \"unequivocally expressed.\"  United States v. Mitchell, supra, at 538, 100 S.Ct., at 1352, quoting United States v. King, 395 U.S. 1, 4, 89 S.Ct. 1501, 1502, 23 L.Ed.2d 52, \"this Court has long decided that limitations and conditions upon which the Government consents to be sued must be strictly observed and exceptions thereto are not to be implied.\"  Soriano v. United States, 352 U.S. 270, 276, 77 S.Ct. 269, 273, 1 L.Ed.2d 306.  See also United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111, 117-118, 100 S.Ct. 352, 357, 62 L.Ed.2d 259;  United States v. Sherwood, supra, at 590-591, 61 S.Ct., at 771-772.\n\n\n10\nWhen Congress has waived the sovereign immunity of the United States, it has almost always conditioned that waiver upon a plaintiff's relinquishing any claim to a jury trial.  Jury trials, for example, have not been made available in the Court of Claims for the broad range of cases within its jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491\u2014i. e., all claims against the united stateS \"foUnded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress, . . . or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.\"  See Glidden Co., supra.  And there is no jury trial right in this same range of cases when the federal district courts have concurrent jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(a)(2) and 2402. Finally, in tort actions against the United States, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b), Congress has similarly provided that trials shall be to the court without a jury.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2402.8\n\n\n11\nThe appropriate inquiry, therefore, is whether Congress clearly and unequivocally departed from its usual practice in this area, and granted a right to trial by jury when it amended the ADEA.9\n\n\n12\nSection 15 of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a (1976 ed. and Supp. III), prohibits age discrimination in federal employment.  Section 15(c) provides the means for judicial enforcement of this guarantee:  any person aggrieved \"may bring a civil action in any Federal district court of competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes\" of the Act. Section 15 contrasts with \u00a7 7(c) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(c) (1976 ed., Supp. III), which authorizes civil actions against private employers and state and local governments, and which expressly provides for jury trials.  Congress accordingly demonstrated that it knew how to provide a statutory right to a jury trial when it wished to do so elsewhere in the very \"legislation cited,\" Galloway, supra, at 389, 63 S.Ct., at 1086. But in \u00a7 15 it failed explicitly to do so.10  SeeFedorenko v. United States, 449 U.S. 490, 512-513, 101 S.Ct. 737, 750-751, 66 L.Ed.2d 686, cf. Monroe v. Standard Oil Co., 452 U.S. 549, 561, 101 S.Ct. 2510, 2517, 69 L.Ed.2d 226.\n\n\n13\nThe respondent infers statutory intent from the language in \u00a7 15(c) providing for the award of \"legal or equitable relief,\" relying on Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40, for the proposition that the authorization of \"legal\" relief supports a statutory jury trial right.  But Lorillard has no application in this context.  In the first place, the word \"legal\" cannot be deemed to be what the Lorillard Court described as \"a term of art\" with respect to the availability of jury trials in cases where the defendant is the Federal Government.  In Lorillard, the authorization for the award of \"legal\" relief was significant largely because of the presence of a constitutional question.  The Court observed that where legal relief is granted in litigation between private parties, the Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to a jury, and reasoned that Congress must have been aware of the significance of the word \"legal\" in that context.  But the Seventh Amendment has no application in actions at law against the Government, as Congress and this Court have always recognized.  Thus no particular significance can be attributed to the word \"legal\" in \u00a7 15(c).\n\n\n14\nMoreover, another basis of the decision in Lorillard was that when Congress chose to incorporate the enforcement scheme of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) into \u00a7 7 of the ADEA, it adopted in ADEA the FLSA practice of making jury trials available.  434 U.S., at 580-583, 98 S.Ct., at 869-871.  Again, that reasoning has no relevance to this case, because Congress did not incorporate the FLSA enforcement scheme into \u00a7 15.  See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a(f) (1976 ed., Supp. III).  Rather, \u00a7\u00a7 15(a) and (b) are patterned after \u00a7\u00a7 717(a) and (b) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in March 1972, see Pub.L.92-261, 86 Stat. 111-112, which extend the protection of Title VII to federal employees.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-16(a) and (b). See 118 Cong.Rec. 24397 (1972) (remarks of Sen. Bentsen, principal sponsor of \u00a7 15 of ADEA).  And, of course, in contrast to the FLSA,11 there is no right to trial by jury in cases arising under Title VII.  See Lorillard, supra, at 583-584, 98 S.Ct., at 871-872;  Great American Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. Novotny, 442 U.S. 366, 375, and n. 19, 99 S.Ct. 2345, 2350, and n. 19, 60 L.Ed.2d 957.\n\n\n15\nThe respondent also infers a right to trial by jury from the fact that Congress conferred jurisdiction over ADEA suits upon the federal district courts, where jury trials are ordinarily available, rather than upon the Court of Claims, where they are not.  Not only is there little logical support for this inference, but the legislative history offers no support for it either.12 Moreover, Rule 38(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that the right to a jury trial \"as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution or as given by a statute of the United States shall be preserved to the parties inviolate\" (emphasis added).  This language hardly states a general rule that jury trials are to be presumed whenever Congress provides for cases to be brought in federal district courts.13  Indeed, Rule 38(a) requires an affirmative statutory grant of the right where, as in this case, the Seventh Amendment does not apply.\n\nB\n\n16\nAs already indicated, it is unnecessary to go beyond the language of the statute itself to conclude that Congress did not intend to confer a right to trial by jury on ADEA plaintiffs proceeding against the Federal Government.  But it is helpful briefly to explore the legislative history, if only to demonstrate that it no more supports the holding of the Court of Appeals than does the statutory language itself.\n\n\n17\nThe respondent cannot point to a single reference in the legislative history to the subject of jury trials in cases brought against the Federal Government.  There is none.  And there is nothing to indicate that Congress did not mean what it plainly indicated when it expressly provided for jury trials in \u00a7 7(c) cases but not in \u00a7 15(c) cases.  In fact, the few inferences that may be drawn from the legislative history are inconsistent with the respondent's position.\n\n\n18\nThe ADEA originally applied only to actions against private employers.  Section 7 incorporated the enforcement scheme used in employee actions against private employers under the FLSA.  In Lorillard, the Court found that the incorporation of the FLSA scheme into \u00a7 7 indicated that the FLSA right to trial by jury should also be incorporated.  The Lorillard holding was codified in 1978 when \u00a7 7(c) was amended to provide expressly for jury trials in actions brought under that section.\n\n\n19\nCongress expanded the scope of ADEA in 1974 to include state and local governments and Federal Government employers.  State and local governments were added as potential defendants by a simple expansion of the term \"employer\" in the ADEA.  The existing substantive and procedural provisions of the Act, including \u00a7 7(c), were thereby extended to cover state and local government employees.  In contrast, Congress added an entirely new section, \u00a7 15, to address the problems of age discrimination in federal employment.  Here Congress deliberately prescribed a distinct statutory scheme applicable only to the federal sector,14 and one based not on the FLSA but, as already indicated, on Title VII,15 where, unlike the FLSA, there was no right to trial by jury.16\n\n\n20\nFinally, in a 1978 amendment to ADEA, Congress declined an opportunity to extend a right to trial by jury to federal employee plaintiffs.  Before the announcement of Lorillard, the Senate, but not the House, had included an amendment to \u00a7 7(c) to provide for jury trials in a pending bill to revise ADEA.  After Lorillard, the Conference Committee recommended and Congress enacted the present \u00a7 7(c)(2), closely resembling the jury trial amendment passed by the Senate.  But the Conference did not recommend, and Congress did not enact, any corresponding amendment of \u00a7 15(c) to provide for jury trials in cases against the Federal Government. Indeed, the conferees recommended and Congress enacted a new \u00a7 15(f), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a(f) (1976 ed., Supp. III), providing that federal personnel actions covered by \u00a7 15 are not subject to any other section of ADEA, with one exception not relevant here.  See H.R.Conf.Rep.No.95-950, p. 11 (1978), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1978, p. 504.  See also H.R.Rep.No.95-527, p. 11 (1977) (\"Section 15 . . . is complete in itself\").  Since the new subsection (f) clearly emphasized that \u00a7 15 was self-contained and unaffected by other sections, including those governing procedures applicable in actions against private employers, Judge Tamm, dissenting in the Court of Appeals, was surely correct when he concluded that \"[i]n amending both sections as it did, Congress could not have overlooked the need to amend [\u00a7 15(c)] to allow jury trials for government employees if it had so wished.\"  202 U.S.App.D.C., at 69, n. 8, 628 F.2d, at 69, n. 8.\n\nC\n\n21\nBut even if the legislative history were ambiguous, that would not affect the proper resolution of this case, because the plaintiff in an action against the United States has a right to trial by jury only where Congress has affirmatively and unambiguously granted that right by statute.  Congress has most obviously not done so here.  Neither the provision for federal employer cases to be brought in district courts rather than the Court of Claims, nor the use of the word \"legal\" in that section, evinces a congressional intent that ADEA plaintiffs who proceed to trial against the Federal Government may do so before a jury. Congress expressly provided for jury trials in the section of the Act applicable to private-sector employers, and to state and local governmental entities.  It did not do so in the section applicable to the Federal Government as an employer, and indeed, patterned that section after provisions in another Act under which there is no right to trial by jury.  The conclusion is inescapable that Congress did not depart from its normal practice of not providing a right to trial by jury when it waived the sovereign immunity of the United States.\n\n\n22\nFor these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\n\n\n23\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n24\nJustice BRENNAN, with whom Justice MARSHALL, Justice BLACKMUN, and Justice STEVENS join, dissenting.\n\n\n25\nIn Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978), this Court held that an employee who brings an action against his private employer under \u00a7 7(c) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA or Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(c), is entitled to trial by jury.  The question presented in this case is whether a plaintiff has a right to trial by jury in an action against the Federal Government under \u00a7 15(c) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a(c).  The Court today holds that a jury trial is not available in such actions.  Because I believe that Congress unmistakably manifested its intention to accord a jury trial right, I dissent.\n\n\n26\n* Respondent brought this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the Secretary of the Navy, alleging violations of the ADEA.  She demanded a jury trial, and the Secretary moved to strike that demand.  The District Court denied the motion to strike but certified for interlocutory appeal the question whether a jury trial is available in an ADEA action against the Federal Government.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).  The Court of Appeals granted the Secretary's petition for interlocutory review and affirmed the ruling of the District Court that respondent is entitled to a jury trial.  Nakshian v. Claytor, 202 U.S.App.D.C. 59, 628 F.2d 59 (1980).  Relying principally on the fact that Congress vested jurisdiction over ADEA suits against the Federal Government in the federal district courts rather than in the Court of Claims and on the authorization in \u00a7 15 (c)he Act for the award of \"legal and equitable relief,\" the Court of Appeals construed the statute to accord a jury trial.\n\nII\n\n27\nIt is well settled that the \"United States, as sovereign, 'is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued.' \"  United States v. Testan, 424 U.S. 392, 399, 96 S.Ct. 948, 953, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976), quoting United States v. Sherwood, 312 U.S. 584, 586, 61 S.Ct. 767, 769, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941).  Consent to suit by the United States must be \"unequivocally expressed.\"  United States V. Mitchell, 445 U.S. 535, 538, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 1352, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980);  United States v. King, 395 U.S. 1, 4, 89 S.Ct. 1501, 1502, 23 L.Ed.2d 52 (1969).  In the ADEA, the United States has expressly waived its immunity, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a (1976 ed. and Supp. III), so that there can be no doubt of its consent to be sued.  The requirement that a waiver of immunity be unequivocally expressed, however, does not, as the Court suggests, carry with it a presumption against jury trial in cases where the United States has waived its immunity.  Indeed, we have previously declined to adopt such a presumption.  See Law v. United States, 266 U.S. 494, 45 S.Ct. 175, 69 L.Ed. 401 (1925);  United States v. Pfitsch, 256 U.S. 547, 41 S.Ct. 569, 65 L.Ed. 1084 (1921).1 Moreover, the Court's view that there is a presumption against jury trials in suits against the Federal Government is belied by the very statutes that it cites to indicate that Congress has often \"conditioned [the] waiver [of immunity] upon a plaintiff's relinquishing any claim to a jury trial.\"  Ante, at 161. The fact that Congress has found it necessary to state expressly that there is no jury trial right in a broad range of cases against the Government, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346, 2402, demonstrates that Congress does not legislate against the backdrop of any presumption against a jury trial right in suits against the United States.  I believe, therefore, that once the Government unequivocally waives its immunity from suit, the plaintiff's right to jury trial is a question of statutory construction.2  The proper inquiry is whether the statute expressly or by fair implication provides for a jury trial.3  See Law v. United States, supra;  United States v. Pfitsch, supra;  5 J. Moore, J. Lucas, & J. Wicker, Moore's Federal Practice \u00b6 38.31[2], p. 38-237 (1981);  9 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2314, p. 69 (1971).  I turn, therefore, to the statute itself.\n\n\n28\nCongress passed the ADEA in 1967 to protect older workers against discrimination in the workplace on the basis of age.  See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621(b), 623;  Oscar Mayer & Co. v. Evans, 441 U.S. 750, 756, 99 S.Ct. 2066, 2071, 60 L.Ed.2d 609 (1979);  Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S., at 577, 98 S.Ct., at 868.  See generally Note, Age Discrimination in Employment, 50 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 924, 945 (1975). The Act's protection was originally limited to employees in the private sector, see Pub.L.90-202, \u00a7 11, 81 Stat. 605, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 630(b) (1970 ed.),4 but Congress amended the Act in 1974 by adding \u00a7 15, which extended protection to federal employees as well.  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a.  Section 15(a) provides that personnel actions affecting federal employees \"shall be made free from any discrimination based on age,\" while \u00a7 15(b) grants the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission authority to enforce the statutory provisions.5  Although there is no provision which expressly grants or precludes a jury trial, Congress provided in \u00a7 15(c), 88 Stat. 75, that \"[a]ny [federal employee] aggrieved may bring a civil action in any Federal district court of competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes of this Act.\"  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a(c) (emphasis added).  It is this provision that I believe demonstrates congressional intent to allow a jury trial in ADEA suits against the Federal Government.\n\n\n29\nIn Lorillard v. Pons, supra, the Court construed \u00a7 7(b) and \u00a7 7(c)6\u2014a provision identical to \u00a7 15(c) in all relevant respects to afford age discrimination plaintiffs the right to a jury trial against private employers.7  The Court reached this result for two reasons.  First, the Court found that the language in \u00a7 7(b), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(b), that \"[t]he provisions of this chapter shall be enforced in accordance with the powers, remedies, and procedures\" of certain provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), suggested that Congress intended to grant a jury trial right because \"[l]ong before Congress enacted the ADEA, it was well established that there was a right to a jury trial in private actions pursuant to the FLSA.\"  434 U.S., at 580, 98 S.Ct., at 869.  Second, and more significant for this case, the Court found that \u00a7 7(c)'s authorization of the courts to grant and individuals to seek \"legal or equitable relief,\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(c) (emphasis added), strongly suggested that Congress intended to grant a jury trial right.  434 U.S., at 583, 98 S.Ct., at 871.  Thus, the Court held, as a matter of statutory construction, that the ADEA allows jury trials in actions against private employers.\n\n\n30\nIn the instant case, Congress similarly authorized aggrieved persons to seek and district courts to grant \"such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter,\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a(c) (emphasis added), thereby suggesting that federal employees are entitled to a jury trial under the ADEA.  As a unanimous Court emphasized in Lorillard:\n\n\n31\n\"The word 'legal' is a term of art:  In cases in which legal      relief is available and legal rights are determined, the      Seventh Amendment provides a right to jury trial.  See Curtis      v. Loether, 415 U.S. 189, 195-196 [94 S.Ct. 1005, 1008-1009,      39 L.Ed.2d 260] (1974).  '[W]here words are employed in a      statute which had at the time a well-known meaning at common      law or in the law of this country they are presumed to have      been used in that sense unless the context compels to the      contrary.'  Standard Oil v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 59 [31      S.Ct. 502, 515, 55 L.Ed. 619] (1911).  See Gilbert v. United      States, 370 U.S. 650, 655 [82 S.Ct. 1399, 1402, 8 L.Ed.2d      750] (1962);   Montclair v. Ramsdell, 107 U.S. 147, 152 [2      S.Ct. 391, 394, 27 L.Ed. 431] (1883).  We can infer,      therefore, that by providing specifically for 'legal' relief,      Congress knew the significance of the term 'legal,' and      intended that there would be a jury trial on demand. . . .\"      434 U.S., at 583,8 98 S.Ct., at 871.\n\n\n32\nAlthough the Seventh Amendment right to trial by jury in suits at common law does not extend to civil actions against the Federal Government, Congress may extend the jury trial right by legislation.  See Galloway v. United States, 319 U.S. 372, 388-389, 63 S.Ct. 1077, 1086, 87 L.Ed. 1458 (1943).  Congress' provision for \"legal and equitable relief\" suggests, therefore, that it intended to allow jury trials in ADEA actions against the Federal Government.\n\n\n33\nThis strong inference that Congress intended to legislate a jury trial right is reinforced by Congress' decision to vest jurisdiction in the District Courts, rather than the Court of Claims, to decide ADEA suits brought against the Federal Government.  This Court has previously observed that vesting jurisdiction in the district courts rather than the Court of Claims supports an inference of a right to jury trial.  In United States v. Pfitsch, the Court stated that \"the right to a jury trial is an incident\" of the grant of \"exclusive jurisdiction in the District Courts.\"  256 U.S., at 552, 41 S.Ct., at 570. Similarly, in Law v. United States, the Court held that the District Court erred in denying a right to a jury trial under the War Risk Insurance Act, when the court concluded that its jurisdiction \"was the exceptional jurisdiction concurrent with the Court of Claims,\" rather than that \"exercised in accordance with the laws governing the usual procedure of the court in actions at law for money compensation.\"  266 U.S., at 496, 45 S.Ct., at 176.9 Congress' vesting of jurisdiction in the federal district courts under \u00a7 15(c) of the ADEA suggest, therefore, that it intended to provide a jury trial right to federal ADEA plaintiffs.10\n\n\n34\nThe legislative history of the 1974 ADEA amendments, extending protection to federal employees, is consistent with the conclusion that Congress intended to allow jury trials. Congress' failure to include federal employees under the ADEA when the Act was first passed\n\n\n35\n\"did not represent a conscious decision by the Congress to      limit the ADEA to employment in the private sector.  It      reflects the fact, that in 1967, when ADEA was enacted, most      government employees were outside the scope of the FLSA and      the Wage Hour and Public Contracts Divisions of the      Department of Labor, which enforces the Fair Labor Standards      Act, were assigned responsibility for enforcing the Age      Discrimination in Employment Act.\"  S.Rep.No.93-690, p. 55.\n\n\n36\nWhen the Act was amended in 1974, Congress intended that \"Government employees . . . be subject to the same protections against arbitrary employment based on age as are employees in the private sector.\"  120 Cong.Rec. 8768 (1974) (remarks of Sen. Bentsen, principal proponent of ADEA extension to federal employees) (emphasis added).11  To be sure, Congress did not provide for identical enforcement schemes for private-sector and federal-sector age discrimination complaints.  But when Congress departed from the \"same protections\" for federal employees, ibid., that it had granted private-sector employees, it did so expressly. Not only did Congress in \u00a7 15 not expressly disallow jury trials where the Federal Government is the defendant, but Congress used the same language in \u00a7 15(c) that it had used in \u00a7 7(c) in authorizing suits in the district courts for legal or equitable relief against private parties.  This strongly suggests that it intended to make the jury trial right it approved against private employers equally applicable to ADEA suits against the Federal Government.\n\n\n37\nThe strong manifestation of congressional intent from both the language and the legislative history of the 1974 amendments is enhanced by the total absence of any persuasive evidence of a contrary legislative intent.  The Court argues, nonetheless, that Congress' decision in 1978 to amend the ADEA to provide explicitly for jury trials in private employer cases brought under \u00a7 7,12 without also amending \u00a7 15(c), demonstrates an intention to preclude jury trials against the Government.  I am completely unpersuaded.\n\n\n38\nThe bill which led to codification of a jury trial right in \u00a7 7(c)(2) was introduced by Senator Kennedy before this Court decided Lorillard.  In order to settle a conflict among the Courts of Appeals over the availability of jury trials in ADEA suits against private employers,13 Senator Kennedy proposed an amendment to the ADEA which would state in haec verba that jury trials are allowed.  123 Cong.Rec. 34317-34318 (1977).14  Senator Kennedy's amendment was adopted by the Senate without debate. Lorillard was subsequently decided.  Thereafter, Congress passed the Kennedy amendment, with a modification proposed by the House at Conference extending the jury trial right beyond that proposed by Senator Kennedy and passed by the Senate to include claims for liquidated damages.  I can discern no congressional intent to preclude the right to a jury trial in ADEA actions against the Federal Government from this sequence of events.  The more plausible explanation, and the one with textual support in the relevant legislative history, H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 95-950, pp. 13-14 (1978), is that Congress understood from the Lorillard opinion that conferring the power to award legal relief suggested a jury trial right15 and that the reason Congress proceeded with the Kennedy amendment was to make clear not only that suits for wages could be tried before a jury, but also that suits for liquidated damages could be tried before a jury, an issue explicitly left unresolved in Lorillard, 434 U.S., at 577, n. 2, 98 S.Ct., at 868, n. 2.16  Moreover, that Congress did not add the same provision to \u00a7 15 that it added to \u00a7 7 is not indicative of an intent to prohibit jury trials for the additional reason that it was the conflict in the Courts of Appeals over whether employees could have a jury trial against private employers which prompted Senator Kennedy to introduce his bill.  There had been no parallel development in the courts interpreting \u00a7 15.  This legislative history, therefore, does not support the conclusion that the Court seeks to draw from it.\n\n\n39\nThe Court also argues that the absence of any reference in \u00a7 15 to the FLSA \"powers, remedies, and procedures\" to which \u00a7 7 refers and upon which Lorillard partially relied suggests that Congress did not intend to allow jury trials against the Federal Government.  But our decision in Lorillard rested equally on the provision in \u00a7 7(c) for \"legal or equitable relief\" as a strong and independent indication of congressional intent to allow jury trials.  In addition, the more likely explanation for the absence of any reference in \u00a7 15 to the FLSA sections referred to in \u00a7 7(b) is that Congress intended to use existing administrative procedures \"to enforce the provisions of [\u00a7 15(a)] through appropriate remedies, including reinstatement or hiring of employees with or without backpay.\"  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a(b) (1976 ed., Supp. III).  Prior to the 1974 amendments extending ADEA coverage to federal employees, employment discrimination complaints by federal employees were processed by the Civil Service Commission, so that it is not surprising that Congress decided to use existing administrative machinery in \u00a7 15(b) to enforce ADEA provisions protecting federal employees. See 39 Fed.Reg. 24351 (1974), reprinted as amended at 29 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 1613.501-1613.521 (1980).17  The failure to refer to FLSA procedures in \u00a7 15 apparently derives, not from a desire to limit jury trials, but from an intention to employ different administrative procedures for age discrimination complaints brought against the Federal Government.18  Seen in this light, the Court's strained interpretation of the failure to refer to FLSA procedures in \u00a7 15 is totally unpersuasive.\n\nIII\n\n40\nBased on the language of \u00a7 15(c) and on the legislative history, which is consistent with my interpretation of that language, I would hold that Congress intended to allow jury trials in ADEA suits against the Federal Government.\n\n\n\n1\n 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634 (1976 ed. and Supp. III).\n\n\n2\n 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a.\n\n\n3\n Section 15(a), as amended in 1978, provides in pertinent part:\n\"All personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment who are at least 40 years of age . . . in military departments [and other enumerated Government agencies] shall be made free from any discrimination based on age.\"  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a(a) (1976 ed. and Supp. III).\n\n\n4\n 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a(b) (1976 ed. and Supp. III).\n\n\n5\n 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 633a(c).\n\n\n6\n Section 7(c), as amended in 1978 and as set forth in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(c) (1976 ed., Supp. III), provides:\n\"(1) Any person aggrieved may bring a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter;  Provided, That the right of any person to bring such action shall terminate upon the commencement of an action by the Commission to enforce the right of such employee under this chapter.\n\"(2) In an action brought under paragraph (1), a person shall be entitled to a trial by jury of any issue of fact in any such action for recovery of amounts owing as a result of a violation of this chapter, regardless of whether equitable relief is sought by any party in such action.\"\nWith the exception of the express right to jury trial conferred by \u00a7 7(c)(2) and of the proviso in \u00a7 7(c)(1), \u00a7 7(c) is identical to \u00a7 15(c), Section 7(c)(2) was added by the 1978 amendments of the ADEA.\n\n\n7\n See n. 6, supra.\n\n\n8\n It is not difficult to appreciate Congress' reluctance to provide for jury trials against the United States.  When fashioning a narrow exception to permit jury trials in tax refund cases in federal district courts under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1), in legislation that Congress recognized established a \"wholly new precedent,\" H.R.Rep.No.659, 83d Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1953), Congress expressed its concern that juries \"might tend to be overly generous because of the virtually unlimited ability of the Government to pay the verdict.\"  Ibid.  Indeed, because of their firm opposition to breaking with precedent, the House conferees took almost a year before acceding to passage of the bill containing that exception.  Only after much debate, and after the conferees became convinced that there would be no danger of excessive verdicts as a result of jury trials in that unique context\u2014because recoveries would be limited to the amount of taxes illegally or erroneously collected\u2014was the bill passed.  See H.R.Conf.Rep.No.2276, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1954).\n\n\n9\n The respondent argues that the strong presumption against the waiver of sovereign immunity has no relevance to the question of a right to trial by jury.  But, it is clear that the doctrine of sovereign immunity and its attendant presumptions must inform the Court's decision in this case.  The reason that the Seventh Amendment presumption in favor of jury trials does not apply in actions at law against the United States is that the United States is immune from suit, and the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial, therefore, never existed with respect to a suit against the United States.  Since there is no generally applicable jury trial right that attaches when the United States consents to suit, the accepted principles of sovereign immunity require that a jury trial right be clearly provided in the legislation creating the cause of action.\n\n\n10\n The dissenters contend that this argument can only be made at the expense of overruling the Lorillard decision.  But, as hereafter indicated Lorillard has little relevance here.  And, of course, the position taken in the dissent totally loses its force in view of the 1978 amendments to the ADEA, see infra, at 167-168, where Congress expressly extended a jury trial right in \u00a7 7(c) but not in \u00a7 15(c).\n\n\n11\n The decisions cited by the Court in Lorillard, 434 U.S., at 580, n. 7, 98 S.Ct., at 870, n. 7, for the proposition that there is a right to a jury trial in FLSA actions all appear to have rested on the Seventh Amendment, not the FLSA itself.  Thus, for the same reason that the Seventh Amendment does not apply in suits against the Federal Government, there would be no comparable right to trial by jury in FLSA suits against the Federal Government under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b).  Accordingly, even if Congress intended to incorporate the FLSA enforcement scheme into \u00a7 15 of the ADEA, there would be no basis for inferring a right to a jury trial in ADEA cases where the employer is the Federal Government.\n\n\n12\n There are a number of reasons why Congress may have chosen to limit jurisdiction to the federal district courts. They, along with state courts, already had jurisdiction of private-sector ADEA cases under \u00a7 7(c).  Congress may have decided to follow the same course in federal-sector cases, but confined jurisdiction to federal district courts so that there would not be trials in state courts of actions against the Federal Government. Exclusive district court jurisdiction is also consistent with the jurisdictional references in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(3) and 2000e-16(c).  Congress may also have believed it appropriate to have trials in federal district courts because they, unlike the Court of Claims, are accustomed to awarding equitable relief of the sort authorized by \u00a7 15(c).\n\n\n13\n The respondent relies on United States v. Pfitsch, 256 U.S. 547, 41 S.Ct. 569, 65 L.Ed. 1084.  But the language relied on in Pfitsch is dicta, since the parties in that case agreed to trial by the court sitting without a jury, id., at 549, 41 S.Ct., at 471, and the jury trial issue was therefore not directly before the Court.  In any event, Pfitsch is plainly distinguishable. There Congress specifically rejected a proposal, \"presented to its attention in a most precise form,\" id., at 552, 41 S.Ct., at 472, to confer concurrent jurisdiction on the district courts and Court of Claims under the Tucker Act and instead conferred a new and exclusive jurisdiction on the district courts.  Given the particular legislative history in that case, the Court found it \"difficult to conceive of any rational ground\" for conferring exclusive jurisdiction on the district courts except to provide for jury trials.  Ibid.  That, of course, is not true here.  See n. 12, supra.  Moreover, Pfitsch arose before Rule 38(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Rule 38(a) made it clear that there is no general right to trial by jury in civil actions in federal district courts.  The Rule establishes a mechanism for determining when there is such a right\u2014i. e., when the Seventh Amendment applies, or if not, when a statute provides it.\nThe respondent also relies on Law v. United States, 266 U.S. 494, 45 S.Ct. 175, 69 L.Ed. 401.  The statement in Law regarding jury trials, which in fact does no more than cite Pfitsch, is also dictum, and of virtually no relevance in this context.\n\n\n14\n A bill introduced by Senator Bentsen on March 9, 1972, S.3318, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., 118 Cong.Rec. 7745 (1972), represented the first attempt to prohibit age discrimination in federal employment.  This bill would have simply amended the definition of \"employer\" in the Act to include the Federal Government, as well as state and local governments.  The result would presumably have been to bring federal employees under the procedural provisions in \u00a7 7.  But Senator Bentsen subsequently submitted a revised version of his bill in the form of an amendment to pending FLSA amendments.  See 118 Cong.Rec. 15894 (1972).  In contrast to Senator Bentsen's original bill, this amendment to the ADEA proposed the expansion of the definition of the term \"employer\" only with respect to state and local governments;  ADEA coverage of federal employees was to be accomplished by the addition of an entirely new and separate section to the Act (presently \u00a7 15).  Senator Bentsen's amendment was included in the FLSA bill reported by the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, S.Rep.No.92-842, pp. 93-94 (1972), and it remained in this form when the bill was enacted into law in 1974.\n\n\n15\n Sections 15(a) and 15(b) of the ADEA, as offered by Senator Bentsen and as finally enacted, are patterned directly after \u00a7\u00a7 717(a) and (b) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in March 1972, see Pub.L.92-261, 86 Stat. 111-112, which extend Title VII protections to federal employees.  Senator Bentsen acknowledged that \"[t]he measures used to protect Federal employees [from age discrimination] would be substantially similar to those incorporated\" in recently enacted amendments to Title VII.  118 Cong.Rec. 24397 (1972).\n\n\n16\n In fact, during floor consideration of the 1972 amendments to Title VII, the Senate rejected an amendment that would have conferred a statutory right to trial by jury in Title VII cases.  Id., at 4919-4920.  Senator Javits, in opposing the amendment, observed that it would impose \"what would be a special requirement in these cases, as distinguished from the antidiscrimination field generally, of jury trial.\"  Id., at 4920.\n\n\n1\n As the Court of Appeals correctly noted:\n\"Since sovereign immunity bars all actions against the Government\u2014actions tried to the court as well as those tried to a jury\u2014it is difficult to see why this doctrine should create a presumption against any particular method of trial. . . .  [O]nce Congress has waived the Government's immunity, and where it has not explicitly specified the trial procedure to be followed, sovereign immunity drops out of the picture.  Courts must then scrutinize the available indicia of legislative intent to see what trial procedure Congress authorized.\"  Nakshian v. Claytor, 202 U.S.App.D.C. 59, 63, n. 4, 628 F.2d 59, 63, n. 4 (1980).\nThe Court's reliance on Soriano v. United States, 352 U.S. 270, 77 S.Ct. 269, 1 L.Ed.2d 306 (1957), is misplaced.  See ante, at 160-161. There, the Court held that the statute of limitations prescribed by Congress barred petitioner's claim against the United States, because the \"disability\" asserted by petitioner to toll the limitations period was not one of the disabilities enumerated in the statute.  In this context, the Court, therefore, concluded that \"limitations and conditions upon which the Government consents to be sued must be strictly observed and exceptions thereto are not to be implied.\"  352 U.S., at 276, 77 S.Ct., at 273.  That is, where Congress has expressly provided for limitations on the waiver of immunity, \"exceptions [to the limitations] are not to be implied.\"  Ibid.  That is not this case.\n\n\n2\n There is of course no Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial against the Federal Government.  Galloway v. United States, 319 U.S. 372, 388-389, 63 S.Ct. 1077, 1086, 87 L.Ed. 1458 (1943); McElrath v. United States, 102 U.S. 426, 440, 26 L.Ed. 189 (1880).\n\n\n3\n Rule 38(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is not to the contrary.  It provides that \"[t]he right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution or as given by a statute of the United States shall be preserved to the parties inviolate.\"  There is no requirement in Rule 38 that Congress make its intent to authorize jury trials express, provided Congress otherwise make its intent known.  Indeed, Rule 38 was fully applicable at the time of Lorillard v. Pons, where this Court found a jury trial right even though the words \"trial by jury,\" did not appear in the statute.  The Court does not argue otherwise in stating that Rule 38 requires \"an affirmative statutory grant\" of the jury trial right.  Ante, at 165. The Court does not argue that Rule 38 requires a jury trial right to be express.  Obviously, that argument would be frivolous since Lorillard found a jury trial right in the absence of an express provision conferring the right.  Either Rule 38 does not require that the grant be express, as I suggest, or the unanimous holding of the Court in Lorillard was wrong.\nStill, the Court misapprehends the thrust of my argument when it states that Rule 38 \"hardly states a general rule that jury trials are to be presumed whenever Congress provides for cases to be brought in federal district courts.\"  Ante, at 165. I have simply argued that conferral of jurisdiction on the district courts raises an inference of a jury trial right in suits against the United States because the Court of Claims, where there is no jury trial right, is an available alternative forum for such cases.  Here, Congress chose for \u00a7 15(c) cases the federal district courts, not the Court of Claims, as the appropriate forum.\n\n\n4\n As originally passed, the definition of the term \"employer\" expressly excluded the United States, States, and political subdivisions from ADEA coverage.  Pub.L. 90-202, \u00a7 11, 81 Stat. 605, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 630(b) (1970 ed.).\n\n\n5\n The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission assumed enforcement authority from the Civil Service Commission in 1978 pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978, \u00a7 2.  3 CFR 321 (1979), 5 U.S.C.App. p. 354 (1976 ed., Supp. III).\n\n\n6\n Section 7(c) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(c), as it read when Lorillard was decided, stated in full:\n\"Any person aggrieved may bring a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter:  Provided, That the right of any person to bring such action shall terminate upon the commencement of an action by the Secretary to enforce the right of such employee under this chapter.\"\n\n\n7\n By construing the statute to allow a jury trial, the Court did not have to decide whether \"the Seventh Amendment requires that in a private action for lost wages under the ADEA, the parties must be given the option of having the case heard by a jury.\"  434 U.S., at 577, 98 S.Ct., at 868.\n\n\n8\n The Court's statement that \"[i]n Lorillard, the authorization for the award of 'legal' relief was significant largely because of the presence of a constitutional question\" is not correct.  Ante, at 163. To be sure, a constitutional question was present in Lorillard, but the Court specifically declined to ground its decision on the Seventh Amendment.  See n. 7, supra. Rather, it construed the language \"legal or equitable relief\" in \u00a7 7(c) of the ADEA.  The Court concluded that when Congress used the words \"legal . . . relief,\" which are equally present in \u00a7 15(c), it intended that a jury trial right be available.  That Congress used the words \"legal . . . relief\" in \u00a7 7(c) differently from the way it used the same words in \u00a7 15(c) is implausible.\nMoreover, the Court erroneously suggests that \u00a7\u00a7 15(a) and (b) are identical to \u00a7\u00a7 717(a) and (b) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, ante, at 163-164, for it fails to note that Title VII does not authorize the courts to award \"legal relief,\" as \u00a7 15(c) does.\n\n\n9\n In United States v. Pfitsch, the Court construed \u00a7 10 of the Lever Act which conferred exclusive jurisdiction in the district courts to hear lawsuits brought by persons dissatisfied with the President's award of compensation for supplies requisitioned by the Federal Government.  In deciding that a judgment rendered under \u00a7 10 is not reviewable in this Court by direct writ of error, the Court stated that Congress \"had the issue clearly drawn between granting for the adjudication of cases arising under [\u00a7 10] concurrent jurisdiction in the Court of Claims and the District Courts without a trial by jury, or of establishing an exclusive jurisdiction in the District Courts of which the right to a jury trial is an incident.\"  256 U.S., at 552, 41 S.Ct., at 570 (emphasis added).\nThat Congress did not, so far as the legislative history indicates, expressly debate vesting concurrent jurisdiction in the Court of Claims over ADEA suits against the Federal Government does not weaken the force of United States v. Pfitsch, despite the Court's protestations to the contrary.  Indeed, in Law v. United States, an important case that the Court virtually ignores, see ante, at 165, n. 13, it was of no significance whether Congress specifically considered vesting jurisdiction in the Court of Claims in order to conclude that the War Risk Insurance Act authorized a jury trial in a suit against the Federal Government. What is significant in the instant case is that, in allowing suits against the Government under the ADEA, Congress expressly opted for jurisdiction in the district courts and not the Court of Claims, which in lawsuits against the Government is a self-evident, alternative forum of which Congress was undoubtedly aware.\n\n\n10\n One leading commentator has concluded:\n\"Congress may confer jurisdiction of actions against the United States upon a district court sitting as a court at law (or equity), as a court of claims, and as a court of admiralty.  And the particular grant of jurisdiction will determine the method of trial, court or jury, in the absence of some express provision dealing with the method of trial.   Thus, absent a provision as to the method of trial, a grant of jurisdiction to a district court as a court at law, carries with it a right of jury trial.\"  5 J. Moore, J. Lucas, & J. Wicker, Moore's Federal Practice \u00b6 38.31[2], p. 38-239 (1981) (emphasis added;  footnotes omitted).\nThe Court rejects the force of the statute's language.  It suggests that, because of similarities between \u00a7 15 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress may simply have wished to provide for federal-court jurisdiction because Title VII had. It argues further that Congress may also have thought that district court jurisdiction was appropriate since the statute provided for grant of equitable as well as legal relief, and that district courts, unlike the Court of Claims, are accustomed to awarding equitable relief.  Ante, at 164, n. 12.  These explanations are purely speculative.  There is no basis in the legislative history for them and they are counter to the logical inferences from the language of the statute.\n\n\n11\n Senator Bentsen also stated:\n\"There is no reason why private enterprise should be subject to restrictions that are not applicable to the Federal Government.\n*          *          *          *          *\n\"What this legislation does is to give these workers coverage under the age discrimination law and to give them a procedure to pursue their complaints.\"  120 Cong.Rec. 5741 (1974).\n\n\n12\n Section 7(c) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(c) (1976 ed., Supp. III), now provides:\n\"(1) Any person aggrieved may bring a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter:  Provided, That the right of any person to bring such action shall terminate upon the commencement of an action by the Secretary to enforce the right of such employee under this chapter.\n\"(2) In an action brought under paragraph (1), a person shall be entitled to a trial by jury of any issue of fact in any such action for recovery of amounts owing as a result of a violation of this chapter, regardless of whether equitable relief is sought by any party in such action.\"\nThe Court contends that the presence of express language granting a jury trial right in \u00a7 7(c) in contrast to the absence of such express language in \u00a7 15 demonstrates that Congress \"knew how to provide a statutory right to a jury trial when it wished to do so.\"  Ante, at 162. I find this argument hard to fathom.  The Court recognizes, as it must, that there was no such express language in \u00a7 7(c) when this Court decided in Lorillard that Congress intended ADEA actions against private employers to include a jury trial right, and that the express language relied on by the Court was added two months after Lorillard was decided and four years after the identical language which was construed in Lorillard was added to the ADEA in \u00a7 15(c).  Therefore, unless the Court is suggesting that the unanimous holding in Lorillard was wrong, the Court is bound to apply the same analysis to this case.\n\n\n13\n Compare Rogers v. Exxon Research & Engineering Co., 550 F.2d 834 (CA3 1977) (right to jury trial), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1022, 98 S.Ct. 749, 54 L.Ed.2d 770 (1978), and Pons v. Lorillard, 549 F.2d 950 (CA4 1977) (same), aff'd, 434 U.S. 575, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978), with Morelock v. NCR Corp., 546 F.2d 682 (CA6 1976) (no right to jury trial), vacated and remanded, 435 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 1463, 55 L.Ed.2d 503 (1978).\n\n\n14\n Senator Kennedy further explained:  \"[J]uries are more likely to be open to the issues which have been raised by the plaintiffs.  Sometimes, a judge may be slightly callous, perhaps because he himself is protected by life tenure, or because he is somewhat removed from the usual employer-employee relationship. The jury may be more neutral in such circumstances.\"  123 Cong.Rec. 34318 (1977).\n\n\n15\n Indeed, the Conference Report specifically noted that the Court had recently decided Lorillard v. Pons, and went on to state:  \"Because liquidated damages are in the nature of legal relief, it is manifest that a party is entitled to have the factual issues underlying such a claim decided by jury.\" H.R.Conf.Rep.No. 95-950, p. 14 (1978), U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 1978, p. 535.\n\n\n16\n \"The Supreme Court recently ruled that a plaintiff is entitled to a jury trial in ADEA actions for lost wages, but it did not decide whether there is a right to jury trial on a claim for liquidated damages.\"  Id., at 13, U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 1978, p. 535.\n\n\n17\n The Court further suggests that, because the ADEA was patterned in significant respects after Title VII, and since Title VII has been held by lower federal courts not to allow a jury trial right, it follows that \u00a7 15 does not contemplate such a right.  I find this argument unpersuasive, as the Court did in Lorillard.  The Court has previously said that, despite important similarities between Title VII and the ADEA, \"it is the remedial and procedural provisions of the two laws that are crucial and there we find significant differences.\"  Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S., at 584, 98 S.Ct., at 872.  \"Congress specifically provided for both 'legal or equitable relief' in the ADEA, but did not authorize 'legal' relief in so many words under Title VII.\"  Ibid.\n\n\n18\n This interpretation is supported by Congress' extension of ADEA protection to employees of state and local governments, which occurred at the same time that Congress extended coverage to federal employees.  Because the definitional section of the Act was amended to include state and local governments within the definition of \"employer,\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 630(b), age discrimination complaints against state and local governments can be tried to a jury for the same reason that complaints against private entities can be.  Nowhere in the legislative history did Congress evince a desire to allow state and local government employees a jury trial right, while withholding the same right from federal employees. Rather, federal employees were covered in a separate section of the Act, apparently so that existing administrative machinery could be used.\n\n\n","label":0}

Stephen Girard, by a will probated in 1831, left a fund in trust for the erection, maintenance, and operation of a 'college.' The will provided that the college was to admit 'as many poor white male orphans, between the ages of six and ten years, as the said income shall be adequate to maintain.' The will named as trustee the City of Philadelphia. The provisions of the will were carried out by the State and City and the college was opened in 1848. Since 1869, by virtue of an act of the Pennsylvania Legislature, the trust has been administered and the college operated by the 'Board of Directors of City Trusts of the City of Philadelphia.'

They met all qualifications except that they were Negroes. For this reason the Board refused to admit them. They petitioned the Orphans' Court of Philadelphia County for an order directing the Board to admit them, alleging that their exclusion because of race violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

Edwin LaVALLEE, Superintendent of Clinton  Correctional Facilityv.Pasquale DELLE ROSE.\nNo. 72\u2014905.\nDecided March 19, 1973.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nThe State of New York petitions for certiorari to review the adverse determination of the Court of Appeals in this federal habeas corpus proceeding directing the release* of respondent Pasquale Delle Rose. Delle Rose was serving a life sentence for the premeditated murder of his wife in 1963. At his trial, occurring before Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964), respondent was convicted by a jury which chose to credit has two confessions over his protestation of accidental involvement, and which presumably found them to be voluntary. On appeal, the New York appellate court directed the trial court to hold a special hearing to determine the voluntariness of his confessions in accordance with People v. Huntley, 15 N.Y.2d 72, 255 N.Y.S.2d 838, 204 N.E.2d 179 (1965), the State's procedural response to this Court's decision in Jackson v. Denno, supra.\n\n\n2\nOn remand to the trial court, the State rested on the trial record, and the respondent, in addition to relying on the record, testified in his own behalf. After extensively summarizing the trial evidence and respondent's explanations of certain of his confession statements, the court concluded:\n\n\n3\n'On all evidence, both at the trial and at the hearing, and      after considering the totality of the circumstances,      including the omission to warn defendant of his right to      counsel and his right against self-incrimination, I find and      decide that the respective confessions to the police and      district attorney were, in all respects, voluntary and      legally admissible in evidence at the trial. . . .'\n\n\n4\nOn this basis, respondent's conviction was affirmed by the New York appellate courts, 33 A.D.2d 657, 27 N.Y.2d 882, 317 N.Y.S.2d 358, 265 N.E.2d 770 (1970), and this Court denied certiorari, 402 U.S. 913, 91 S.Ct. 1395, 28 L.Ed.2d 656 (1971).\n\n\n5\nRespondent then petitioned the United States District Court for writ of habeas corpus alleging his confessions were involuntary. That court held that since the state trial judge had 'neglected to say how far he credited\u2014and to what extent, if any, he discounted or rejected' respondent's testimony and the evidence before him, there was no 'adequate' determination within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), which would have entitled the state court's findings to a presumption of correctness and placed on respondent the burden of establishing by convincing evidence that the state court's conclusion was erroneous. The District Court therefore held its own hearing, found both confessions involuntary, and ordered respondent discharged from custody unless retried, 342 F.Supp. 567. A divided panel of the Second Circuit affirmed, 468 F.2d 1288.\n\n\n6\nThe Court of Appeals held that the state court's opinion did not meet the requisites of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) which provides in relevant part:\n\n\n7\n'(A) determination after a hearing on the merits of a factual      issue, made by a State court of competent jurisdiction . . .      evidenced by a written finding, written opinion, or other      reliable and adequate written indicia, shall be presumed to      be correct, unless the applicant shall establish or it shall      otherwise appear, . . .\u2014\n\n\n8\n'(1) that the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved      in the State court hearing . . ..'\n\n\n9\nAlthough it is true that the state trial court did not specifically articulate its credibility findings, it can scarcely be doubted from its written opinion that respondent's factual contentions were resolved against him.\n\n\n10\nRespondent's wife was killed by a blast from a sawed-off shotgun device which had been set to shoot through the back of their front car seat. His confessions indicated that because of extreme jealousy, he rigged the device to go off when his wife pulled the car seat forward. For some reason it failed initially; so when he was seated with her in the car, he operated it by hand. At trial, he claimed his confessions were false and testified that he was seated in the car with his wife and he noticed a lump on the floor behind the front seat.\n\n\n11\nWhen he reached down to investigate, it shot her.\n\n\n12\nAt trial, in support of his theory of relentless questioning and police coercion, respondent presented evidence to the effect that, at the time of his confessions,\n\n\n13\n'he had had a back injury, and therefore was in pain; that he      was taken to the garage and asked to put his hand in the back      seat where the blood of his wife was; that the police      threatened to beat him up if he did not admit he killed her;      that he was compelled to say by the police that he had killed      his wife but that what he meant was that he had done so      inadvertently, by placing his hand over the lump; and that,      after telling the officer he wanted to see his wife, he did      not remember what happened thereafter until 9:00 o'clock in      the morning.'\n\n\n14\nIn addition, as his 'Huntley' hearing, he testified that the officers told him they would beat him up if he did not talk to them; that one of the detectives told him to put his hands in the front seat hole where his wife's blood was and when he did not, the detective took his hands and put them there himself; and that he did not remember anything past the time when he asked to see his wife at the morgue, including the giving of the second statement. He also attempted to explain the reasons for his giving such detailed and factually accurate confession statements.\n\n\n15\nThe trial court's summary of the State's evidence tended to show that although respondent had been taken to the station house about 5 p.m. on the day of the murder, he was not even a suspect as late as 9 p.m., and he was only giving information. He was taken to the morgue at his own request, a factor which triggered the first confession. Further, he had been allowed to sit with his family, was given coffee by his mother-in-law and police, and he admitted that his treatment by the police was good during the time of the questioning. There was also testimony that he had been offered food, but as he admitted, he was not hungry. Again at the 'Huntley' hearing, he acknowledged that the police had treated him 'nice.' It was 'on this evidence' that the state trial court made its finding and conclusion that the confessions were voluntary.\n\n\n16\nThe Court of Appeals stated that it could not tell whether the state courts 'credited Delle Rose's story of the circumstances surrounding his confessions but still held these to have been voluntary, a conclusion to which we could not agree or based their holding of voluntariness on a partial or complete rejection of his testimony, in which event the district judge would have been bound to deny the petition.' 468 F.2d 1288, 1290. In Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 314\u2014315, 315, 83 S.Ct. 745, 757\u2014758, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), the precursor of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), this Court set forth general standards governing the holding of hearings on federal habeas petitions, stating:\n\n\n17\n'(T)he possibility of legal error may be eliminated in many      situations if the fact finder has articulated the      constitutional standards which he has applied. Furthermore,      the coequal responsibilities of state and federal judges in      the administration of federal constitutional law are such      that he think the district judge may, in the ordinary case in      which there has been no articulation, properly assume that      the state trier of fact applied correct standards of federal      law to the facts, in the absence of evidence . . . that there      is reason to suspect that an incorrect standard was in fact      applied. Thus, if third-degree methods of obtaining a      confession are alleged and the state court refused to exclude      the confession from evidence, the district judge may assume      that the state trier found the facts against the petitioner,      the law being, of course, that theird-degree methods      necessarily produce a coerced confession.' Here, not only is there no evidence that the state trier utilized the wrong standard, but there is every indication he applied the correct standards. His determination was made on the 'totality of the circumstances' and, in this pre-Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964), pre-Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), situation, the court also considered the facts that respondent was not warned of his rights to the assistance of counsel and against self-incrimination before confessing. And we quite agree with the District Court's statement that it could not go along with the state trial court's conclusion of voluntariness if it 'were to find the facts to have been as petitioner's (Delle Rose's) testimony portrayed them.' See, e.g., Spano v. New York, 360 U.S. 315, 79 S.Ct. 1202, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265 (1959); Watts v. Indiana, 338 U.S. 49, 69 S.Ct. 1347, 93 L.Ed. 1801 (1949). Under these circumstances, we think the District Court could have been reasonably certain that the state court would have granted relief if it had believed respondent's allegations. See Townsend v. Sain, supara, 372 U.S., at 315, 83 S.Ct., at 758.\n\n\n18\nWe, therefore, hold that the opinion of the state trial court met the requirements of 28 U.S.C \u00a7 2254 (d)(1), and that the courts below incorrectly determined it did not. The burden was thus on respondent to establish in the District Court by convincing evidence that the state court's determination was erroneous. The motion of the respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for certiorari are granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n19\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n20\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, Mr. Justice BRENNAN, and Mr. Justice STEWART concur, dissenting.\n\n\n21\nAlthough I am in complete disagreement with this Court's per curiam decision herein, I see no reason to set this case for oral argument in light of the majority's firmly held views.\n\n\n22\nI cannot accept the Court's holding that both the District Court and the Court of Appeals improperly concluded that the voluntariness of respondent's confessions was not adequately resolved by the state trial court, thereby relieving respondent of the obligation to establish 'by convincing evidence that the factual determination by the State court was erroneous,' 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The Court does not deny that the state trial court judge, after summarizing the record evidence and respondent's testimony on the question of voluntariness, utterly failed to explain the basis for his conclusion that 'considering the totality of circumstances . . . the respective confessions to the police and district attorney were, in all respects, voluntary and legally admissible in evidence at the trial . . ..' Despite this absence of any reasoned explanation for the state court's action, the Court now assures us that 'it can scarcely be doubted from its written opinion that respondent's factual contentions were resolved against him.' Ante, at 692. I could not disagree more, and therefore I must respectfully dissent.\n\n\n23\nForemost, the Court's certainty as to the basis for the state court's action rests upon the fact that it is clear the state court 'applied' the correct legal standard in evaluating the voluntariness of respondent's confession. Without question, the state court in this case ritualistically recited the standard of 'totality of the circumstances' which governs the determination of voluntariness with respect to these 1963 confessions. See, e.g., Clewis v. Texas, 386 U.S. 707, 708, 87 S.Ct. 1338, 1339, 18 L.Ed.2d 423 (1967). But this recitation in itself provided the courts below with no guarantee that the state court had not erroneously applied this standard to the facts of this case, perhaps accepting respondent's version of the circumstances surrounding the confession, rather than rejecting respondent's version as incredible. Thus, the able District Judge noted that '(t)his court cannot be 'reasonably certain' what facts of possibly coercive or stressful impact the trial judge found from the disputed testimony' introduced before him. 342 F.Supp. 567, 570.\n\n\n24\nThe Court, however, places heavy reliance upon our prior statement in Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 314\u2014315, 83 S.Ct. 745, 758, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), the source of the test set forth in \u00a7 2254(d)(1), that 'the district judge may, in the ordinary case in which there has been no articulation, properly assume that the state trier of fact applied correct standards of federal law to the facts, in the absence of evidence . . . that there is reason to suspect that an incorrect standard was in fact applied. Thus, if third-degree methods of obtaining a confession are alleged and the state court refused to exclude the confession from evidence, the district judge may assume that the state trier found the facts against the petitioner, the law being, of course, that third-degree methods necessarily produce a coerced confession.'1 But this is hardly the limit of the inquiry\u2014contemplated by Townsend and \u00a7 2254(d)\u2014 into whether a state court has adequately resolved the factual issues presented by the constitutional claim.\n\n\n25\n'(E)ven if it is clear that the state trier of fact utilized      the proper standard, a hearing is sometimes required if his      decision presents a situation in which the 'so-called facts      and their constitutional significance (are) . . . so blended      that they cannot be severed in consideration.' . . . Unless      the district judge can be reasonably certain that the state      trier would have granted relief if he had believed      petitioner's allegations, he cannot be sure that the state      trier in denying relief disbelieved these allegations. If any      combination of the facts alleged would prove a violation of      constitutional rights and the issue of law on those facts      presents a difficult or novel problem for decision, any      hypothesis as to the relevant factual determinations of the      state trier involves the purest speculation. The federal      court cannot exclude the possibility that the trial judge      believed facts which showed a deprivation of constitutional      rights and yet (erroneously) concluded that relief should be      denied. Under these circumstances it is impossible for the      federal court to reconstruct the facts, and a hearing must be      held.' Townsend v. Sain, supra, at 315\u2014316, 83 S.Ct., at 758      (emphasis added).\n\n\n26\nThe precise problem encountered by the courts below in evaluating the state court's conclusion\u2014a problem which the Court now effectively ignores\u2014is that the issue of voluntariness in this case presents just the sort of 'difficult' mixed question of law and fact which Townsend recognized would make federal court speculation concerning the basis for unreasoned state court action wholly inappropriate. To be sure, where, for instance, a defendant alleges simply that a confession was extracted from him by means of a physical beating administered by the police, it is obvious that if the defendant's story is believed, the confession would be involuntary. Thus, even if a state court holds the defendant's confession to be voluntary without articulating any reasons, a federal district court may safely assume that in such an uncomplicated situation the state court's determination resulted from a rejection of the defendant's factual allegations. But it can hardly be argued that this case involves allegations of the type of straightforward police 'third-degree methods of obtaining a confession' which the Townsend Court suggested would entail little possibility of misapplication of the relevant legal standard so that a district court might, with reasonable confidence, assume that an unexplained state court finding of voluntariness rests upon a rejection of the defendant's version of the interrogation, not upon constitutional error. For a review of the state court's opinion following the 'Huntley' hearing reveals that here the state court was confronted, not with an allegation of a single coercive incident which, if believed, would clearly have resulted in a finding of involuntariness, but rather with allegations of a series of coercive police actions applied to a particularly susceptible suspect.\n\n\n27\nRespondent claimed that he was held and interrogated, apparently without rest, from 5 p.m. on the day of the murder until sometime early the next morning. Throughout this time, respondent purportedly was suffering pain due to a serious back ailment and was undoubtedly handicapped by his lack of facility with the English language. Meanwhile, without any warnings as to his constitutional rights, he was questioned repeatedly by police officers, questioning which allegedly included physical threats if he refused to confess. During this process, respondent was compelled by the police to reenact the alleged murder of his wife complete with his hand being forced by a police officer into the torn seat back which was wet with his wife's blood. Then the police offered to take respondent on what the District Court properly described as a 'macabre' visit to the morgue to see his dead wife's body. There the police obtained the first confession. Subsequently, further questioning by an assistant district attorney produced a second confession at about 6 a.m. A defense psychiatrist testified at trial that respondent was, in his opinion, so exhausted from his long ordeal at the hands of the police that 'he would say yes if you asked him if the moon were made of green cheese.'\n\n\n28\nIt is possible, of course, that the state court rejected all of respondent's testimony as incredible and therefore properly held the confessions voluntary. On the other hand, if the state court had believed all of respondent's contentions, it would undoubtedly have found the confessions involuntary. There remains, however, the third possibility that the state court believed some of respondent's contentions and rejected others. It is this last possibility that makes for substantial uncertainty in a factually complex case such as this as to whether the the state court correctly applied the abstract legal standard and did not, instead, commit constitutional error. Due to the unrevealing nature of the state court's decision, it is impossible to say that that court may not have credited a sufficient portion of respondent's story to establish, under the controlling standard, the involuntariness of his confessions and nevertheless have reached an erroneous conclusion of voluntariness because the question may have been a close one on the facts that it accepted. It is this inherent uncertainty as to what the state court may have believed or disbelieved that justified the action of the District Court and the Court of Appeals in this case. To conclude otherwise, I believe, ignores the full import of this Court's reasoning in Townsend v. Sain, supra, concerning those limited situations in which a federal district court on habeas corpus may reasonably assume that an unexplained state court determination rests merely upon a rejection of testimony rather than upon constitutional error.\n\n\n29\nConsequently, in my view, the courts below properly held the State not entitled in this case to the presumption of correctness and the special burden of proof set forth in \u00a7 2254(d).2 As for the merits, I see no basis for this Court to set aside the District Court's finding of involuntariness, a finding sustained by the Court of Appeals as not 'clearly erroneous' under Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 52(a). Cf. Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 201, 93 S.Ct. 375, 383, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972) (opinion of Brennan, J.).\n\n\n\n*\n Respondent was ordered released unless retried within 60 days without the use of his confessions.\n\n\n1\n Insofar as the Court relies upon this language fromTownsend in interpreting \u00a7 2254(d)(1), the Court effectively ignores the discretionary character of the decision lodged with the district judge who is faced with a question as to the adequacy of unexplained state court findings. Townsend indicates that 'the district judge may, in the ordinary case in which there has been no articulation, properly assume' that the state court reached a constitutionally permissible conclusion. (Emphasis added.) Today, however, the Court effectively indicates that the district court often must assume in such cases that the proper standard was applied. Such a rigid standard seems to me wholly improper and unworkable where the question whether the defendant's testimony was simply rejected and the proper standard applied is essentially one of judgment dependent upon the facts of each particular case. These matters are properly left largely to the discretion of the district judge. And here, certainly, it cannot be said such discretion was abused.\n\n\n2\n The Court, of course, does not hold that the District Court erred in holding a de novo evidentiary hearing on the voluntariness of respondent's confession. That is a question distinct from the presumption of validity and the special burden of proof established by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Section 2254(d) says nothing concerning when a district judge may hold an evidentiary hearing\u2014as opposed to acting simply on the state court record\u2014in considering a state prisoner's petition for federal habeas corpus. So far as I understand, the question whether such a hearing is appropriate on federal habeas corpus continues to be controlled exclusively by our decision in Townsend v. Sain even after the enactment of \u00a7 2254(d). See Developments in the Law\u2014Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1141 (1970). And, Townsend explicitly recognizes that, apart from the six specific instances described in that opinion as mandating an evidentiary hearing '(i)n all other cases where the material facts are in dispute, the holding of . . . a hearing is in the discretion of the district judge. . . . In every case he has the power, constrained only by his sound discretion, to receive evidence bearing upon the applicant's constitutional claim.' 372 U.S., at 318, 83 S.Ct., at 760.\n\n\n","label":0}

Barry, Oklahoma City, Okl., for petitioners.\nMr. Rexord Bond, Chickasha, Okl., for respondent.\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nIn 1901 an Apache Indian, Paukune, was issued a trust patent to land in Caddo County, Oklahoma. This allotment was made under the General Allotment Act of February 8, 1887, 24 Stat. 388, 389.1 Paukune died testate in 1919, leaving a wife Juana and a son Jose. By his will he devised an undivided one-third interest in the allotment to his widow and an undivided two-thirds interest to his son. No fee patent to the land has issued to Paukune, to his widow, or to the son. The trust period of twenty-five years has from time to time been extended. In other words, the United States still holds the land in trust for Paukune and his heirs.\n\n\n2\nIn 1947 Juana's undivided one-third interest was assessed for ad valorem taxes in the amount of $21.33 and was advertised for sale for failure to pay. She thereupon instituted this suit in the Oklahoma courts to enjoin the sale and any further levy of ad valorem taxes on the theory that the land was exempt from state taxation. The petitioners answered, alleging that Juana was a non-Indian and therefore not exempt from the taxes. The trial court, without determining whether the widow was an Indian, held her interest nontaxable by the state; and the Supreme Court of Oklahoma affirmed, Okl., 244 P.2d 1137, saying it mattered not under federal law whether the widow was Indian or non-Indian. The case is here on certiorari.\n\n\n3\nLevindale Lead & Zinc Mining Co. v. Coleman, 241 U.S. 432, 36 S.Ct. 644, 60 L.Ed. 1080, dealt with restrictions on alienation attached to land under the Osage Indian Allotment Act of June 28, 1906, 34 Stat. 539. The Court held that the policy of that Act did not embrace person who were not Indians, since the Congress sought to protect only those toward whom it owed the duties of a guardian. The same answer must be given here. If Juana is not an Indian, the United States has no interest of hers in the land to protect.2 True, the United States holds the legal title to the land. But nothing in the Act prevents the devolution of the quitable interest to the widow. If she is not within the class whom Congress sought to protect, the trust is a dry and passive one; there remains only a ministerial act for the trustee to perform, namely the issuance of a fee patent to the cestui.\n\n\n4\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma is reversed and the cause is remanded to that court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. So ordered.\n\n\n5\nJudgment reversed and cause remanded with directions.\n\n\n\n1\n Section 5 of the Act, 25 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 348, provides in part as follows: 'That upon the approval of the allotments provided for in this act by the Secretary of the Interior, he shall cause patents to issue therefor in the name of the allottees, which patents shall be of the legal effect, and declare that the United States does and will hold the land thus allotted, for the period of twenty-five years, in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian to whom such allotment shall have been made, or, in case of his decease, of his heirs according to the laws of the State or Territory where such land is located, and that at the expiration of said period the United States will convey the same by patent to said Indian, or his heirs as aforesaid, in fee, discharged of said trust and free of all charge or incumbrance whatsoever: Provided, That the President of the United States may in any case in his discretion extend the period. And if any conveyance shall be made of the lands set apart and allotted as herein provided, or any contract made touching the same, before the expiration of the time above mentioned, such conveyance or contract shall be absolutely null and void: Provided, That the law of descent and partition in force in the State or Territory where such lands are situate shall apply thereto after patents therefor have been executed and delivered, except as herein otherwise provided * * *.'\n\n\n2\n And see Mixon v.

{"text":"454 U.S. 393\n102 S.Ct. 715\n70 L.Ed.2d 576\nLarry BLANDING, et al., Appellants,v.E. M. DuBOSE, et al.\nNo. 81-325.\nJan. 11, 1982.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nAppellants, citizens of Sumter County, S.C., have taken an appeal from a summary judgment entered against them on February 17, 1981, by the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina.  The three-judge District Court concluded that Sumter County in June 1979 had made a preclearance submission under \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 439, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973c, when it wrote the United States Attorney General informing him that a referendum had approved at-large County Council elections.  Because the Attorney General failed to object within 60 days to the claimed preclearance submission, the District Court permitted Sumter County to proceed with at-large elections for its County Council.  We hold that the county's June 1979 letter was a reconsideration request, not a preclearance submission, and reverse.\n\n\n2\n* Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act1 provides that when a covered political subdivision enacts a voting procedure different from that in effect on November 1, 1964, the political subdivision must either seek a declaratory judgment in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia approving the procedure or submit it to the United States Attorney General for preclearance.  If the procedure is submitted to the Attorney General and he does not interpose an objection to the preclearance submission within 60 days, the procedure may be enforced.\n\n\n3\nOn November 1, 1964, Sumter County was governed by its South Carolina General Assembly delegation acting through a County Board of Supervisors.  In 1967, the General Assembly enacted a local bill that established a new form of government for Sumter County, namely, a seven-member County Commission elected at large.  See 1967 S.C.Acts, No. 371.  Although this change required preclearance under \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act, no steps were taken to obtain preclearance and at-large elections were held in 1968, 1970, 1972, and 1974.\n\n\n4\nIn 1975, the General Assembly passed, and the Governor approved, the State's Home Rule Act, 1975 S.C.Acts, No. 283, codified as S.C.Code \u00a7 4-9-10 et seq. (1976 and Supp.1980).  The Act permitted a South Carolina county to hold a referendum to select a form of local government and to choose between at-large and single-member district elections.  \u00a7 4-9-10.  The Act specifically provided that if Sumter County did not hold a referendum, it would be assigned, effective July 1, 1976, the council-administrator form of government with council members elected at-large.  \u00a7 4-9-10(b).\n\n\n5\nThe Home Rule Act was submitted to the Attorney General of the United States for preclearance.  The Attorney General2 did not interpose an objection to the Act, as such, but he indicated that the outcomes of Home Rule Act referenda or assignments of forms of government under the Act would be subject to preclearance.\n\n\n6\nSumter County chose not to hold a referendum.  Accordingly, it was assigned the council-administrator form of government with at-large elections.  The County Council passed a resolution and ordinance adopting that form of government and method of election.\n\n\n7\nOn August 13, 1976, the County Administrator submitted the Sumter County Home Rule Ordinance and the 1967 Act to the Attorney General for preclearance.  On December 3, after having obtained necessary additional information, see 28 CFR \u00a7 51.18 (1980), the Attorney General made a timely objection to the at-large method of election of the Council.  He interposed no objection to the council-administrator form of government.\n\n\n8\nThe county requested the Attorney General to reconsider his objection to at-large elections, see \u00a7 51.21(b), and the county and the Attorney General continued to correspond during 1977 and 1978.  In early 1978, the county asked whether the Attorney General would withdraw his objection if a county referendum endorsed the at-large method of election.  On April 28 of that year, the Attorney General declined to withdraw the objection and advised the county that a favorable referendum result, by itself, would not cause him to change his mind.\n\n\n9\nA Council election was scheduled for June 13, 1978.  After the Attorney General refused to withdraw his objection, private parties and the United States brought separate federal suits to prevent elections under the at-large system.  The two suits were consolidated.  A single judge issued a temporary restraining order, and on June 21, 1978, a three-judge District Court permanently enjoined County Council elections until the requirements of the Voting Rights Act were fulfilled.\n\n\n10\nIn November 1978, Sumter County went ahead with its referendum in which voters were asked whether they preferred that Council members be elected at-large or from single-member districts.  The majority endorsed the at-large method.  Because Council members already were being elected under the at-large system, the county did not enact any resolution or ordinance to adopt the results of the referendum.\n\n\n11\nThen came the critical exchange of correspondence.  On June 4, 1979, the Attorney General received a letter, dated June 1, from the county advising him of the referendum results.  The letter expressed doubt as to whether it was a new preclearance submission of the at-large method, see 28 CFR \u00a7 51.2(c) (1980), or a request that the Attorney General reconsider his earlier objection to at-large elections, see \u00a7 51.21.3  Subsequently, on July 23, a conference was held in Washington, D. C., between county officials and representatives of the Department of Justice. See \u00a7 51.23.  Fifteen days later, see \u00a7 51.24,4 on August 7, the Attorney General, referring to the county's letter as a \"request for reconsideration,\" refused to withdraw the objection to at-large elections, but advised the county that the Department of Justice had not yet completed its review.  On September 27, the Attorney General for a second time refused to withdraw his objection.  See \u00a7 51.25.5\n\n\n12\nThereafter, the defendant-appellees moved the District Court for summary judgment.  They contended that the June letter was a preclearance submission, not a request for reconsideration. Section 5, the appellees noted, requires the Attorney General to object within 60 days of a preclearance submission.  They asserted that, since the Attorney General did not interpose an objection by August 3, the county was free under \u00a7 5 to proceed with at-large elections.\n\n\n13\nA three-judge District Court was again convened.  It agreed with appellees.  509 F.Supp. 1334 (1981).  Referring to \u00a7 5 of the Voting Rights Act, the court observed that the 1978 referendum approved a method of electing county officials different from that in effect on November 1, 1964.  The letter received June 4, 1979, according to the District Court, was the required preclearance submission.  Rejecting the Attorney General's argument that the letter was a request for reconsideration of his timely 1976 objection to at-large elections, the District Court declared: \"This Court will not be a party to the [Attorney General's] effort to excuse his failure to act by mislabeling a submission for preclearance as a 'request for reconsideration.' \"6  509 F.Supp., at 1336.\n\nII\n\n14\nWe conclude that the District Court, not the Attorney General, mislabeled the June 1979 letter.  The court ruled that that letter was a preclearance submission because the referendum approved a method of selecting officials different from that in effect on November 1, 1964.  But the change to at-large County Council elections already had been submitted to the Attorney General for preclearance.  The 1978 referendum merely approved the pre-existing at-large method\u2014the very method to which the Attorney General earlier had made a timely objection.  Because the referendum did no more than endorse a method of election that previously had been submitted to the Attorney General and that was the subject of an outstanding objection, the June letter did not amount to a new preclearance submission.\n\n\n15\nIndeed, the June letter fell squarely within the definition of a reconsideration request.  The applicable regulation provides that the Attorney General will reconsider his objection upon a request by a submitting authority \"to present further substantiating or explanatory information which was not previously available to the submitting authority.\"  28 CFR \u00a7 51.21(b) (1980). The results of the referendum constituted further explanatory information concerning at-large elections which the county asked the Attorney General to consider. The June letter thus was nothing more than a request that the Attorney General reconsider his earlier objection to at-large County Council elections in light of the referendum results.\n\n\n16\nThe District Court put forward several reasons why, in its view, the June letter was not a reconsideration request.  None of them persuades us.  First, the District Court pointed out that the county already had made one reconsideration request.  But the regulations do not limit a political subdivision to a single request for reconsideration.  Second, the court relied upon 28 CFR \u00a7 51.21(b) (1980), which requires that a reconsideration request be made within 10 days of the Attorney General's objection.  The Attorney General, however, follows the laudable practice of accepting reconsideration requests even though they are untimely, thus considering possibly important information that was not available within 10 days of the original objection.  See also \u00a7 51.25 (permitting the Attorney General to reconsider his objection on his own motion).  In any event, the mere fact that a reconsideration request is untimely does not convert it into a preclearance submission.  Third, the court also cited \u00a7 51.21(b) for the proposition that a reconsideration request must be based on information not previously available.  That requirement poses no obstacle to considering the June letter a reconsideration request, because the outcome of the referendum constituted information not previously available to Sumter County authorities. And, just as a reconsideration request does not become a preclearance submission merely by being untimely, so a reconsideration request does not become a preclearance submission simply by being repetitive.\n\n\n17\nNot only does the District Court decision mischaracterize the June letter, but its decision also has undesirable results.  Under that court's ruling, a political subdivision could recommence the 60-day period at will by readopting the contested voting procedure.  In addition, the Attorney General would be forced to interpose redundant objections to the same change in voting laws.  For these reasons also, we refuse to accept the District Court's interpretation of \u00a7 5.\n\n\n18\nFinally, we have frequently stated that courts should grant deference to the interpretation given statutes and regulations by the officials charged with their administration.  See, e.g., Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 444 U.S. 555, 100 S.Ct. 790, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980);  United States v. Sheffield Board of Comm'rs, 435 U.S. 110, 131, 98 S.Ct. 965, 979, 55 L.Ed.2d 148 (1978); Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965).  In this case, the Attorney General employed reasonable definitions of a preclearance submission and of a reconsideration request when he treated the June letter as in the latter category.  Indeed, the Attorney General followed the more sensible course.7\n\nThe judgment of the District Court is\n\n19\n\nReversed.\n\n\n\n20\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE concurs in the judgment.\n\n\n21\nJustice REHNQUIST, with whom Justice POWELL joins, concurring.\n\n\n22\nThe per curiam correctly concludes that the June 1, 1979, letter from Sumter County was a request for reconsideration, not a preclearance submission.  Therefore, I concur in the per curiam's reasoning and conclusion.  I concur reluctantly, however, for the record in this case illustrates what I view as the unreasonably burdensome and unrealistic control which the Federal Government routinely exercises over state and local governments under the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\n23\nThe record recounts a 5-year effort by Sumter County to obtain the approval of several United States Assistant Attorneys General for an election method adopted by the South Carolina General Assembly.  This effort included occasional correspondence with high-level attorneys in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, and, apparently, more frequent contact with low-level attorneys who requested information about plans, statistics, histories, names, places, and related facts.  Although such communications are not unusual in dealings with today's federal bureaucracy, the record portrays a particularly frustrating effort to please a distant authority with veto power over the decisions of local officials.  For example, an October 31, 1977, letter from appellees to an Assistant Attorney General explains the county's legal inability under state law to comply with various \"suggestions\" from the Department of Justice.  The letter concludes:\n\n\n24\n\"This leaves us in a dilemma.  The [County] Council doesn't      wish to be in the position of seeming to pay no attention to      your suggestion that the form of election should properly be      changed;  or to seem to be disregarding your suggestions.  On      the other hand, the County's Council is advised that it has      inadequate legal power to act under South Carolina law in the      manner you seem to be suggesting. . . .  Perhaps you can      suggest something to us which would help us to resolve our      difficulties which have us disturbed, perplexed, and      confounded.\"  1 Record, Defendants' Exhibit 20, pp. 2-3,      attached to County Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment,      filed Jan. 25, 1980.\n\n\n25\nToday's decision, of course, will only reopen the dispute and again place the county at the mercy of attorneys in the Justice Department.  There seems to be something inherently unsatisfactory about a system which places such discretionary authority in the hands of a few unelected federal officials who are wholly detached from the realities of the locality and the preferences of the local electorate.  Nonetheless, it is the system which Congress has established, and I therefore concur in the judgment.\n\n\n\n1\n Section 5, as amended, reads in pertinent part as follows:\n\"Whenever a State or political subdivision with respect to which the prohibitions set forth in section 1973b(a) of this title based upon determinations made under the first sentence of section 1973b(b) of this title are in effect shall enact or seek to administer any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting different from that in force or effect on November 1, 1964, . . . such State or subdivision may institute an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for a declaratory judgment that such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color, . . . and unless and until the court enters such judgment no person shall be denied the right to vote for failure to comply with such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure:  Provided, That such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure may be enforced without such proceeding if the qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure has been submitted by the chief legal officer or other appropriate official of such State or subdivision to the Attorney General and the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within sixty days after such submission. . . .  Any action under this section shall be heard and determined by a court of three judges in accordance with the provisions of section 2284 of title 28 and any appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court.\"\n\n\n2\n The Attorney General acted through the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division.\n\n\n3\n The letter states:  \"We are uncertain as to whether this submission should be termed a 'new submission,' or a 'request' for reconsideration of the Attorney General's objection to the County's original submission.\"  1 Record, Defendants' Exhibit 7, p. 3, attached to County Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment filed with the District Court on Jan. 25, 1980.\n\n\n4\n Section 51.24 reads:\n\"An objection shall be withdrawn if the submitting authority can produce information not previously available to it which satisfies the Attorney General that the change does not have a racially discriminatory purpose or effect.  The Attorney General shall notify the submitting authority within 60 days of the request for reconsideration (provided that the Attorney General shall have at least 15 days following any conference that is held in which to decide) of his decision to continue or withdraw an objection, giving the reasons for his decision.  A copy of the notification shall be sent to any party that has commented on the submission or has requested notice of the Attorney General's action thereon.\"\n\n\n5\n The District Court in its opinion, 509 F.Supp. 1334 (1981), omitted mention of the August 7 letter, which is Defendants' Exhibit 8 attached to the motion for summary judgment. The court stated that the Attorney General did not take action following the July 23 conference until he refused to withdraw his objection on September 27.  509 F.Supp., at 1336.  In this respect, the decision of the District Court was clearly erroneous.\n\n\n6\n Once it concluded that the June letter was a preclearance submission, the District Court found that the Attorney General's actions were untimely.  But it can hardly be said that the Attorney General failed to act in response to the June letter.  We note again that Department of Justice officials held a conference with Sumter County officials on July 23, that the Attorney General refused to withdraw his objection on August 7, within 15 days of that conference, and that the Attorney General once more, on September 27, refused to withdraw his objection.\n\n\n7\n Before the District Court, there was a dispute whether the June letter was accompanied by a multipage document supplying, inter alia, the information required by 28 CFR \u00a7 51.10 (1980), or whether that document was first presented to the Department of Justice at the July 23 conference.  If the document was not presented until July 23, the Attorney General's August 7 letter might not have been untimely even if the June letter were a preclearance submission.  See \u00a7\u00a7 51.3(b) and 51.18(a).  See also City of Rome v. United States, 446 U.S. 156, 171, 100 S.Ct. 1548, 1559, 64 L.Ed.2d 119 (1980).  Because we hold that the June letter was not a preclearance submission, we need not address this issue.\n\n\n","label":1}

William LA GAY, Superintendent of New Jersey  State Prison Farm at Rahway,New Jersey.\nNo. 177.\nArgued April 2, 1958.\nDecided June 30, 1958.\n\nMr. Dickinson R. Debevoise, Newark, N.J., for petitioner.\nMr. C. William Caruso, Newark, N.J., for respondent.\nMr. Justice HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nWe are asked to reverse under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States a state conviction which was entered upon a plea of non vult to an indictment for first degree murder.\n\n\n2\nIn the evening of March 17, 1947, Charles Kittuah, the owner of a small dry goods store in Newark, New Jersey, was shot and killed during the course of a robbery. The crime remained unsolved until December 17, 1949, when the Newark police obtained information implicating the petitioner and two others, Armando Corvino and John DeMasi. Petitioner lived with his parents at Orange, New Jersey. Apparently acting at the request of the Newark police, the Orange police sought to locate petitioner at his home. When told that her was out, the police left word that he was to report at the Orange police headquarters the following day. Petitioner sought the advice of Frank A. Palmieri, a lawyer, who advised him to report as requested. Petitioner did so, accompanied by his father and brother. Upon arrival at the Orange police station at 9 a.m. on December 18, petitioner was separated from the others and taken by detectives to the Newark police headquarters. At approximately 2 p.m. the same day petitioner's father, brother and Mr. Palmieri, the lawyer, arrived at the Newark station. Mr. Palmieri immediately asked to see petitioner, but this request was refused by the police. He repeated this request at intervals throughout the afternoon and well into the evening, but without success. During this period petitioner, who was being questioned intermittently by the police, asked to see his lawyer. These requests were also denied. Lawyer and client were not permitted to confer until 9:30 p.m., by which time petitioner had made and signed a written confession to the murder of Kittuah. The confession is not in the record.\n\n\n3\nPetitioner was arraigned the next day, December 19, and subsequently indicted, along with Corvino and DeMasi, both of whom had also confessed to the murder. Thereafter, petitioner moved in the Essex County Court for an order requiring the State to produce for inspection before trial his confession and the confessions of his co-defendants and, alternatively, for an order suppressing his confession on the ground that it had been illegally obtained. The County Court denied the motion. The Superior Court of New Jersey dismissed the appeal, State v. Cicenia, 9 N.J.Super. 135, 75 A.2d 476, and the Supreme Court of New Jersey affirmed the dismissal, with modifications. 6 N.J. 296, 78 A.2d 568. The State Supreme Court held that New Jersey had no procedure like that under Rule 41(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A., by which inadmissible evidence could be suppressed before trial; that under New Jersey law criminal defendants did not have an absolute right to inspect their confessions in advance of trial; and that the trial judge in this instance did not abuse his discretion in disallowing such an inspection.\n\n\n4\nFollowing his failure to suppress or obtain inspection of his confession petitioner, on the advice of his attorney, offered to plead non vult to the indictment. In New Jersey such a plea is subject to discretionary acceptance by the trial court, State v. Martin, 92 N.J.L. 436, 106 A. 385, 17 A.L.R. 1090, and carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Petitioner's plea was accepted by the trial court, as were the similar pleas of Corvino and DeMasi, whose cases are not before us. Petitioner and his two co-defendants were thereupon sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor.\n\n\n5\nThereafter petitioner commenced habeas corpus proceedings in the New Jersey courts, alleging that his plea of non vult was actuated by the existence of the confession, and that the conviction entered upon such plea was vitiated under both the State and Federal Constitutions because the confession was coerced and because it had been taken in derogation of his right to the assistance of counsel. The County Court, the Superior Court, and the Supreme Court of New Jersey in turn denied relief,1 and this Court denied certiorari. Cicenia v. State of New Jersey, 350 U.S. 925, 76 S.Ct. 215, 100 L.Ed. 809. Petitioner then commenced in the District Court for New Jersey the federal habeas corpus proceeding before us, attacking his conviction on the grounds stated above. The District Court discharged the writ, holding that petitioner had failed to establish the involuntariness of the confession and that the State's refusal to permit petitioner to communicate with counsel during the police inquiry did not deprive him of due process. Application of Cicenia, D.C., 148 F.Supp. 98. The Court of Appeals affirmed, 3 Cir., 240 F.2d 844, and we granted certiorari to consider the constitutional questions presented. Cicenia v. Lagay, 354 U.S. 908, 77 S.Ct. 1297, 1 L.Ed.2d 1426.2\n\n\n6\nAn independent examination of the record satisfies us that the District Court was justified in concluding that petitioner failed to substantiate the charge that his confession was coerced. Petitioner does not now contend to the contrary. He continues to contend, however, that under the Fourteenth Amendment his confession, even though voluntary, was nevertheless vitiated by police refusal to permit him to confer with counsel during his detention at Newark police headquarters, and that because his plea of non vult was based on the confession, the conviction must fall as well.3\n\n\n7\nThe contention that petitioner had a constitutional right to confer with counsel is disposed of by Crooker v. California, 357 U.S. 433, 78 S.Ct. 1287, decided today. There we held that California's failure to honor Crooker's request during a period of police interrogation to consult with a lawyer, as yet unretained, did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the present case, in which petitioner was denied an opportunity to confer with the lawyer whom he had already retained, sharply points up the constitutional issue involved, some additional observations are in order.\n\n\n8\nWe share the strong distaste expressed by the two lower courts over the episode disclosed by this record. Cf. Stroble v. California, 343 U.S. 181, 197\u2014198, 72 S.Ct. 599, 607, 96 L.Ed. 872. Were this a federal prosecution we would have little difficulty in dealing with what occurred under our general supervisory power over the administration of justice in the federal courts. See McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819. But to hold that what happened here violated the Constitution of the United States is quite another matter.\n\n\n9\nThe difficulties inherent in the problem require no extensive elaboration. Cf. Watts v. Indiana, 338 U.S. 49, 57\u201462, 69 S.Ct. 1347, 1351, 1359, 93 L.Ed. 1801 (opinion of Jackson, J.). On the one hand, it is indisputable that the right to counsel in criminal cases has a high place in our scheme of procedural safeguards. On the other hand, it can hardly be denied that adoption of petitioner's position would constrict state police activities in a manner that in many instances might impair their ability to solve difficult cases. A satisfactory formula for reconciling these competing concerns is not to be found in any broad pronouncement that one must yield to the other in all instances. Instead, as we point out in Crooker v. California, supra, this Court, in judging whether state prosecutions meet the requirements of due process, has sought to achieve a proper accommodation by considering a defendant's lack of counsel one pertinent element in determining from all the circumstances whether a conviction was attended by fundamental unfairness. See House v. Mayo, 324 U.S. 42, 45\u201446, 65 S.Ct. 517, 519\u2014520, 89 L.Ed. 739; Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U.S. 560, 567, 78 S.Ct. 844, 849, 2 L.Ed.2d 975.\n\n\n10\nIn contrast, petitioner would have us hold that any state denial of a defendant's request to confer with counsel during police questioning violates due process, irrespective of the particular circumstances involved. Such a holding, in its ultimate reach, would mean that state police could not interrogate a suspect before giving him an opportunity to secure counsel. Even in federal prosecutions this Court has refrained from laying down any such inflexible rule. See McNabb v. United States, supra; Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, 77 S.Ct. 1256, 1 L.Ed.2d 1479. Still less should we impose this standard on each of the 48 States as a matter of constitutional compulsion.4 It is well known that law-enforcement problems vary widely from State to State, as well as among different communities within the same State. This Court has often recognized that it is of the 'very essence of our federalism that the States should have the widest latitude in the administration of their own systems of criminal justice.' Hoag v. New Jersey, 356 U.S. 464, 468, 78 S.Ct. 829, 833, 2 L.Ed.2d 913. See Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U.S. 581, 20 S.Ct. 448, 44 L.Ed. 597; Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78, 29 S.Ct. 14, 53 L.Ed. 97. The broad rule sought here and in Crooker would require us to apply the Fourteenth Amendment in a manner which would be foreign both to the spirit in which it was conceived and the way in which it has been implemented by this Court.\n\n\n11\nPetitioner's remaining constitutional contention can be disposed of briefly. He argues that he was deprived of due process because New Jersey required him to plead to the indictment for murder without the opportunity to inspect his confession.\n\n\n12\nThe Fourteenth Amendment does not reach so far. As stated by the Supreme Court of New Jersey in the earlier proceedings in this case, State v. Cicenia, 6 N.J. 296, at pages 299\u2014301, 78 A.2d 568, at pages 570\u2014571, the rule in that State is that the trial judge has discretion whether or not to allow inspection before trial. This is consistent with the practice in many other jurisdictions. See, e.g., State v. Haas, 188 Md. 63, 51 A.2d 647; People v. Skoyec, 183 Misc. 764, 50 N.Y.S.2d 438; State v. Clark, 21 Wash.2d 774, 153 P.2d 297. In Leland v. Oregon, 343 U.S. 790, 801\u2014802, 72 S.Ct. 1002, 1008\u20141009, 96 L.Ed. 1302, this Court held that in the absence of a showing of prejudice to the defendant it was not a violation of due process for a State to deny counsel an opportunity before trial to inspect his client's confession. It is true that in Leland the confession was made available to the defense at the trial several days before its case was rested, whereas here petitioner pleaded non vult without an opportunity to see the confession. We think that the principle of that case is nonetheless applicable. As was said in Leland (343 U.S. at page 801, 72 S.Ct. at page 1008), although it may be the 'better practice' for the prosecution to comply with a request for inspection, we cannot say that the discretionary refusal of the trial judge to permit inspection in this case offended the Fourteenth Amendment. Cf. Application of Tune, 3 Cir., 230 F.2d 883, 890\u2014892.\n\n\n13\nAffirmed.\n\n\n14\nMr. Justice BRENNAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n15\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice BLACK concur, dissenting.\n\n\n16\nPetitioner, pursuant to a request left by the police at his home on Saturday, December 17, appeared at headquarters in Orange, New Jersey, at 9 a.m. on the 18th. He did so on the advice of his lawyer, Frank A. Palmieri. Petitioner's brother and father accompanied him on this visit but were separated from him on arrival at the headquarters. Shortly thereafter petitioner was taken to Newark where he was interrogated by the police until 9:30 p.m. when he confessed. Between 2 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. Mr. Palmieri asked over and again to see his client; but his requests were not granted. On this phase of the case the District Court said:\n\n\n17\n'Mr. Palmieri was not produced as a witness on the trial of      this case, but his affidavit was admitted by stipulation. The contents of his affidavit and the testimony      of petitioner's father and brother are at variance with the      testimony of the Newark police as to the manner in which      petitioner and his counsel were restrained from communicating      with each other. According to petitioner's witnesses      Palmieri's pleas were met with blunt refusals and remarks      such as 'We're working on him.' The police claim to have been      much more decorous. But whether it was done flippantly or      courteously, the fact remains that for over seven hours the      Newark police formed an insuperable barrier between an      accused who wanted to see his counsel, and counsel who wanted      to see his client. And it was during these seven hours that      the police and an assistant prosecutor were able to obtain a      detailed confession from petitioner.' 148 F.Supp. 98, 99\u2014100.\n\n\n18\nThe District Court reached 'without enthusiasm' the conclusion that petitioner's constitutional rights had not been impaired. Id., at page 104. The Court of Appeals evinced the same lack of enthusiasm for the result. 3 Cir., 240 F.2d 844. Both lower courts felt that any correction of this unjust result should come from us. I regret that we have not taken this case, and the companion cases, as the occasion to bring our decisions into tune with the constitutional requirement for fair criminal proceedings against the citizen. I would reverse the judgment for the reasons stated in my dissent in Crooker v. California, 357 U.S. 441, 78 S.Ct. 1293.\n\n\n\n1\n The opinions of the County Court and Superior Court are not reported. The State Supreme Court wrote no opinion.\n\n\n2\n Although the State does not contend that the case is not properly here, we have nevertheless felt obliged to consider our jurisdiction in view of the following circumstances: New Jersey has a rule that a defendant who pleads guilty waives the right to attack a confession on which such plea is based. See In re Domako, 20 N.J.Super. 314, 90 A.2d 30, affirmed 11 N.J. 591, 95 A.2d 505. Following that rule, the Essex County Court held that petitioner could not attack his conviction on habeas corpus. On appeal the Superior Court did not advert to that question, but affirmed the County Court on the ground that under New Jersey law petitioner had no constitutional right to counsel prior to arraignment. See State v. Grillo, 11 N.J. 173, 93 A.2d 328. The State Supreme Court gave no reasons for denying leave to appeal. Since the Superior Court had dealt with petitioner's constitutional claims on the merits, the two lower federal courts decided that they had the power to consider them. Cf. Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 486, 73 S.Ct. 397, 422, 97 L.Ed. 469; Hawk v. Olson, 326 U.S. 271, 278, 66 S.Ct. 116, 120, 90 L.Ed. 61. We agree that jurisdiction exists. In the absence of a definitive New Jersey ruling that the Domako waiver principle applies to a plea of non vult, we shall not assume that the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision denying leave to appeal was based on that nonfederal ground. Cf. Stembridge v. Georgia, 343 U.S. 541, 72 S.Ct. 834, 96 L.Ed. 1130. Our conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the Superior Court did not rely on the Domako rule, and by the absence of any challenge to our jurisdiction by the State.\n\n\n3\n Since we conclude that the police refusal to allow petitioner to consult with his lawyer did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment, we need not consider the State's further contention that petitioner was not denied due process because the confession was never 'used' against him, he having pleaded non vult to the indictment. But cf. Com. of Pa. ex rel. Herman v. Claudy, 350 U.S. 116, 76 S.Ct. 223, 100 L.Ed. 126.\n\n\n4\n New Jersey is not alone in its rule that an accused has no right to consult with counsel during the period between arrest and arraignment. See State v. Rogers, 143 Conn. 167, 120 A.2d 409; State of Utah v. Sullivan, 10 Cir., 227 F.2d 511; People v. Kelly, 404 Ill. 281, 89 N.E.2d 27. Most States have not had occasion to rule on the issue before us, and it is generally quite unclear in state law when the right to have counsel begins. See Beaney, The Right to Counsel in American Courts, 127\u2014128; 3 A.L.R.2d 1003, 1032 et seq.\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"377 U.S. 201\n84 S.Ct. 1199\n12 L.Ed.2d 246\nWinston MASSIAH, Petitioner,v.UNITED STATES.\nNo. 199.\nArgued March 3, 1964.\nDecided May 18, 1964.\n\nRobert J. Carluccio, New York City, Edmund A. Rosner, New York City, of counsel, for petitioner.\nArchibald Cox, Sol. Gen., for respondent.\nMr. Justice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe petitioner was indicted for violating the federal narcotics laws. He retained a lawyer, pleaded not guilty, and was released on bail. While he was free on bail a federal agent succeeded by surreptitious means in listening to incriminating statements made by him. Evidence of these statements was introduced against the petitioner at his trial over his objection. He was convicted, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.1 We granted certiorari to consider whether, under the circumstances here presented, the prosecution's use at the trial of evidence of the petitioner's own incriminating statements deprived him of any right secured to him under the Federal Constitution. 374 U.S. 805, 83 S.Ct. 1698, 10 L.Ed.2d 1030.\n\n\n2\nThe petitioner, a merchant seaman, was in 1958 a member of the crew of the S. S. Santa Maria. In April of that year federal customs officials in New York received information that he was going to transport a quantity of narcotics aboard that ship from South America to the United States. As a result of this and other information, the agents searched the Santa Maria upon its arrival in New York and found in the afterpeak of the vessel five packages containing about three and a half pounds of cocaine. They also learned of circumstances, not here relevant, tending to connect the petitioner with the cocaine. He was arrested, promptly arraigned, and subsequently indicted for possession of narcotics aboard a United States vessel.2 In July a superseding indictment was returned, charging the petitioner and a man named Colson with the same substantive offense, and in separate counts charging the petitioner, Colson, and others with having conspired to possess narcotics aboard a United States vessel, and to import, conceal, and facilitate the sale of narcotics.3 The petitioner, who had retained a lawyer, pleaded not guilty and was released on bail, along with Colson.\n\n\n3\nA few days later, and quite without the petitioner's knowledge, Colson decided to cooperate with the government agents in their continuing investigation of the nacotics activities in which the petitioner, Colson, and others had allegedly been engaged. Colson permitted an agent named Murphy to install a Schmidt radio transmitter under the front seat of Colson's automobile, by means of which Murphy, equipped with an appropriate receiving device, could overhear from some distance away conversations carried on in Colson's car.\n\n\n4\nOn the evening of November 19, 1959, Colson and the petitioner held a lengthy conversation while sitting in Colson's automobile, parked on a New York street. By prearrangement with Colson, and totally unbeknown to the petitioner, the agent Murphy sat in a car parked out of sight down the street and listened over the radio to the entire conversation. The petitioner made several incriminating statements during the course of this conversation. At the petitioner's trial these incriminating statements were brought before the jury through Murphy's testimony, despite the insistent objection of defense counsel. The jury convicted the petitioner of several related narcotics offenses, and the convictions were affirmed by the Court of Appeals.4\n\n\n5\nThe petitioner argues that it was an error of constitutional dimensions to permit the agent Murphy at the trial to testify to the petitioner's incriminating statements which Murphy had overheard under the circumstances disclosed by this record. This argument is based upon two distinct and independent grounds. First, we are told that Murphy's use of the radio equipment violated the petitioner's rights under the Fourth Amendment, and, consequently, that all evidence which Murphy thereby obtained was, under the rule of Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652, inadmissible against the petitioner at the trial. Secondly, it is said that the petitioner's Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated by the use in evidence against him of incriminating statements which government agents had deliberately elicited from him after he had been indicted and in the absence of his retained counsel. Because of the way we dispose of the case, we do not reach the Fourth Amendment issue.\n\n\n6\nIn Spano v. New York, 360 U.S. 315, 79 S.Ct. 1202, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265, this Court reversed a state criminal conviction because a confession had been wrongly admitted into evidence against the defendant at his trial. In that case the defendant had already been indicted for first-degree murder at the time he confessed. The Court held that the defendant's conviction could not stand under the Fourteenth Amendment. While the Court's opinion relied upon the totality of the circumstances under which the confession had been obtained, four concurring Justices pointed out that the Constitution required reversal of the conviction upon the sole and specific ground that the confession had been deliberately elicited by the police after the defendant had been indicted, and therefore at a time when he was clearly entitled to a lawyer's help. It was pointed out that under our system of justice the most elemental concepts of due process of law contemplate that an indictment be followed by a trial, 'in an orderly courtroom, presided over by a judge, open to the public, and protected by all the procedural safeguards of the law.' 360 U.S., at 327, 79 S.Ct. at 1209, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265 (STEWART, J., concurring). It was said that a Constitution which guarantees a defendant the aid of counsel at such a trial could surely vouchsafe no less to an indicted defendant under interrogation by the police in a completely extrajudicial proceeding. Anything less, it was said, might deny a defendant 'effective representation by counsel at the only stage when legal aid and advice would help him.' 360 U.S., at 326, 79 S.Ct., at 1209, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265 (DOUGLAS, J., concurring).\n\n\n7\nEver since this Court's decision in the Spano case, the New York courts have unequivocally followed this constitutional rule. 'Any secret interrogation of the defendant, from and after the finding of the indictment, without the protection afforded by the presence of counsel, contravenes the basic dictates of fairness in the conduct of criminal causes and the fundamental rights of persons charged with crime.' People v. Waterman, 9 N.Y.2d 561, 565, 216 N.Y.S.2d 70, 75, 175 N.E.2d 445, 448.5\n\n\n8\nThis view no more than reflects a constitutional principle established as long ago as Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158, where the Court noted that '* * * during perhaps the most critical period of the proceedings * * * that is to say, from the time of their arraignment until the beginning of their trial, when consultation, thorough-going investigation and preparation (are) vitally important, the defendants * * * (are) as much entitled to such aid (of counsel) during that period as at the trial itself.' Id., 287 U.S., at 57, 53 S.Ct., at 59, 77 L.Ed. 158. And since the Spano decision the same basic constitutional principle has been broadly reaffirmed by this Court. Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114; White v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed.2d 193. See Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799.\n\n\n9\nHere we deal not with a state court conviction, but with a federal case, where the specific guarantee of the Sixth Amendment directly applies.6 Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461. We hold that the petitioner was denied the basic protections of that guarantee when there was used against him at his trial evidence of his own incriminating words, which federal agents had deliberately elicited from him after he had been indicted and in the absence of his counsel. It is true that in the Spano case the defendant was interrogated in a police station, while here the damaging testimony was elicited from the defendant without his knowledge while he was free on bail. But, as Judge Hays pointed out in his dissent in the Court of Appeals, 'if such a rule is to have an efficacy it must apply to indirect and surreptitious interrogations as well as those conducted in the jailhouse. In this case, Massiah was more seriously imposed upon * * * because he did not even know that he was under interrogation by a government agent.' 307 F.2d at 72\u201473.\n\n\n10\nthe Solicitor General, in his brief and oral argument, has strenuously contended that the federal law enforcement agents had the right, if not indeed the duty, to continue their investigation of the petitioner and his alleged criminal assocites even though the petitioner had been indicted. He points out that the Government was continuing its investigation in order to uncover not only the source of narcotics found on the S. S. Santa Maria, but also their intended buyer. He says that the quantity of narcotics involved was such as to suggest that the petitioner was part of a large and well-organized ring, and indeed that the continuing investigation confirmed this suspicion, since it resulted in criminal charges against many defendants. Under these circumstances the Solicitor General concludes that the Government agents were completely 'justified in making use of Colson's cooperation by having Colson continue his normal associations and by surveilling them.'\n\n\n11\nWe may accept and, at least for present purposes, completely approve all that this argument implies, Fourth Amendment problems to one side. We do not question that in this case, as in many cases, it was entirely proper to continue an investigation of the suspected criminal activities of the defendant and his alleged confederates, even though the defendant had already been indicted. All that we hold is that the defendant's own incriminating statements, obtained by federal agents under the circumstances here disclosed, could not constitutionally be used by the prosecution as evidence against him at his trial.\n\n\n12\nReversed.\n\n\n13\nMr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice CLARK and Mr. Justice HARLAN join, dissenting.\n\n\n14\nThe current incidence of serious violations of the law represents not only an appalling waste of the potentially happy and useful lives of those who engage in such conduct but also an overhanging, dangerous threat to those unidentified and innocent people who will be the victims of crime today and tomorrow. This is a festering problem for which no adequate cures have yet been devised. At the very least there is much room for discontent with remedial measures so far undertaken. And admittedly there remains much to be settled concerning the disposition to be made of those who violate the law.\n\n\n15\nBut dissatisfaction with preventive programs aimed at eliminating crime and profound dispute about whether we should punish, deter, rehabilitate or cure cannot excuse concealing one of our most manacing problems until the millennium has arrived. In my view, a civilized society must maintain its capacity to discover transgressions of the law and to identify those who flout it. This much is necessary even to know the scope of the problem, much less to formulate intelligent counter-measures. It will just not do to sweep these disagreeable matters under the rug or to pretend they are not there at all.\n\n\n16\nIt is therefore a rather portentous occasion when a constitutional rule is established barring the use of evidence which is relevant, reliable and highly probative of the issue which the trial court has before it\u2014whether the accused committed the act with which he is charged. Without the evidence, the quest for truth may be seriously impeded and in many cases the trial court, although aware of proof showing defendant's guilt, must nevertheless release him because the crucial evidence is deemed inadmissible. This result is entirely justified in some circumstances because exclusion serves other policies of overriding importance, as where evidence seized in an illegal search is excluded, not because of the quality of the proof, but to secure meaningful enforcement of the Fourth Amendment. Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652; Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081. But this only emphasizes that the soundest of reasons is necessary to warrant the exclusion of evidence otherwise admissible and the creation of another area of privileged testimony. With all due deference, I am not at all convinced that the additional barriers to the pursuit of truth which the Court today erects rest on anything like the solid foundations which decisions of this gravity should require.\n\n\n17\nThe importance of the matter should not be underestimated, for today's rule promises to have wide application well beyond the facts of this case. The reason given for the result here\u2014the admissions were obtained in the absence of counsel\u2014would seem equally pertinent to statements obtained at any time after the right to counsel attaches, whether there has been an indictment or not; to admissions made prior to arraignment, at least where the defendant has counsel or asks for it; to the fruits of admissions improperly obtained under the new rule; to criminal proceedings in state courts; and to defendants long since convicted upon evidence including such admissions. The new rule will immediately do service in a great many cases.\n\n\n18\nWhatever the content or scope of the rule may prove to be, I am unable to see how this case presents an unconstitutional interference with Massiah's right to counsel. Massiah was not prevented from consulting with counsel as often as he wished. No meetings with counsel were disturbed or spied upon. Preparation for trial was in no way obstructed. It is only a sterile syllogism an unsound one, besides\u2014to say that because Massiah had a right to counsel's aid before and during the trial, his out-of-court conversations and admissions must be excluded if obtained without counsel's consent or presence. The right to counsel has never meant as much before, Cicenia v. LaGay, 357 U.S. 504, 78 S.Ct. 1297, 2 L.Ed.2d 1523; Crooker v. California, 357 U.S. 433, 78 S.Ct. 1287, 2 L.Ed.2d 1448, and its extension in this case requires some further explanation, so far unarticulated by the Court.\n\n\n19\nSince the new rule would exclude all admissions made to the police, no matter how voluntary and reliable, the requirement of counsel's presence or approval would seem to rest upon the probability that counsel would foreclose any admissions at all. This is nothing more than a thinly disguised constitutional policy of minimizing or entirely prohibiting the use in evidence of voluntary out-of-court admissions and confessions made by the accused. Carried as far as blind logic may compel some to go, the notion that statements from the mouth of the defendant should not be used in evidence would have a severe and unfortunate impact upon the great bulk of criminal cases.\n\n\n20\nViewed in this light, the Court's newly fashioned exclusionary principle goes far beyond the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, which neither requires nor suggests the barring of voluntary pretrial admissions. The Fifth Amendment states that no person 'shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself * * *.' The defendant may thus not be compelled to testify at his trial, but he may if he wishes. Likewise he may not be compelled or coerced into saying anything before trial; but until today he could if he wished to, and if he did, it could be used against him. Whether as a matter of self-incrimination or of due process, the proscription is against compulsion\u2014coerced incrimination. Under the prior law, announced in countless cases in this Court, the defendant's pretrial statements were admissible evidence if voluntarily made; inadmissible if not the product of his free will. Hardly any constitutional area has been more carefully patrolled by this Court, and until now the Court has expressly rejected the argument that admissions are to be deem d involuntary if made outside the presence of counsel. Cicenia v. LaGay, supra; Crooker v. California, supra.*\n\n\n21\nThe Court presents no facts, no objective evidence, no reasons to warrant scrapping the voluntary-involuntary test for admissibility in this area. Without such evidence I would retain it in its present form.\n\n\n22\nThis case cannot be analogized to the American Bar Association's rule forbidding an attorney to talk to the opposing party litigant outside the presence of his counsel. Aside from the fact that the Association's canons are not of constitutional dimensions, the specific canon argued is inapposite because it deals with the conduct of lawyers and not with the conduct of investigators. Lawyers are forbidden to interview the opposing party because of the supposed imbalance of legal skill and acumen between the lawyer and the party litigant; the reason for the rule does not apply to non-lawyers and certainly not to Colson, Massiah's codefendant.\n\n\n23\nApplying the new exclusionary rule is peculiarly inappropriate in this case. At the time of the conversation in question, petitioner was not in custody but free on bail. He was not questioned in what anyone could call an atmosphere of official coercion. What he said was said to his partner in crime who had also been indicted. There was no suggestion or any possibility of coercion. What petitioner did not know was that Colson had decided to report the conversation to the police. Had there been no prior arrangements between Colson and the police, had Colson simply gone to the police after the conversation had occurred, his testimony relating Massiah's statements would be readily admissible at the trial, as would a recording which he might have made of the conversation. In such event, it would simply be said that Massiah risked talking to a friend who decided to disclose what he knew of Massiah's criminal activities. But, if, as occurred here, Colson had been cooperating with the police prior to his meeting with Massiah, both his evidence and the recorded conversation are somehow transformed into inadmissible evidence despite the fact that the hazard to Massiah remains precisely the same\u2014the defection of a confederate in crime.\n\n\n24\nReporting criminal behavior is expected or even demanded of the ordinary citizen. Friends may be subpoenaed to testify about friends, relatives about relatives and partners about partners. I therefore question the soundness of insulating Massiah from the apostasy of his partner in crime and of furnishing constiutional sanction for the strict secrecy and discipline of criminal organizations. Neither the ordinary citizen nor the confessed criminal should be discouraged from reporting what he knows to the authorities and from lending his aid to secure evidence of crime. Certainly after this case the Colsons will be few and far between; and the Massiahs can breathe much more easily, secure in the knowledge that the Constitution furnishes an important measure of protection against faithless compatriots and guarantees sporting treatment for sporting peddlers of narcotics.\n\n\n25\nMeanwhile, of course, the public will again be the loser and law enforcement will be presented with another serious dilemma. The general issue lurking in the background of the Court's opinion is the legitima y of penetrating or obtaining confederates in criminal organizations. For the law enforcement agency, the answer for the time being can only be in the form of a prediction about the future application of today's new constitutional doctrine. More narrowly, and posed by the precise situation involved here, the question is this: when the police have arrested and released on bail one member of a criminal ring and another member, a confederate, is cooperating with the police, can the confederate be allowed to continue his association with the ring or must he somehow be withdrawn to avoid challenge to trial evidence on the ground that it was acquired after rather than before the arrest, after rather than before the indictment?\n\n\n26\nDefendants who are out on bail have been known to continue their illicit operations. See Rogers v. United States, 325 F.2d 485 (C.A.10th Cir.). That an attorney is advising them should not constitutionally immunize their statements made in furtherance of these operations and relevant to the question of their guilt at the pending prosecution. In this very case there is evidence that after indictment defendant Aiken tried to persuade Agent Murphy to go into the narcotics business with him. Under today's decision, Murphy may neither testify as to the content of this conversation nor seize for introduction in evidence any narcotics whose location Aiken may have made known.\n\n\n27\nUndoubtedly, the evidence excluded in this case would not have been available but for the conduct of Colson in cooperation with Agent Murphy, but is it this kind of conduct which should be forbidden to those charged with law enforcement? It is one thing to establish safeguards against procedures fraught with the potentiality of coercion and to outlaw 'easy but self-defeating ways in which brutality is substituted for brains as an instrument of crime detection.' McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 344, 63 S.Ct. 608, 615, 87 L.Ed. 819. But here there was no substitution of brutality for brains, no inherent danger of police coercion justifying the prophylatic effect of another exclusionary rule. Massiah was not being interrogated in a police station, was not surrounded by numerous officers or questioned in relays, and was not forbidden access to others. Law enforcement may have the elements of a contest about it, but it is not a game. McGuire v. United States, 273 U.S. 95, 99, 47 S.Ct. 259, 260, 71 L.Ed. 556. Massiah and those like him receive ample protection from the long line of precedents in this Court holding that confessions may not be introduced unless they are voluntary. In making these determinations the courts must consider the absence of counsel as one of several factors by which voluntariness is to be judged. See House v. Mayo, 324 U.S. 42, 45\u201446, 65 S.Ct. 517, 519\u2014520, 89 L.Ed. 739; Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U.S. 560, 567, 78 S.Ct. 844, 849\u2014850, 2 L.Ed.2d 975; Cicenia v. LaGay, supra, 357 U.S., at 509, 78 S.Ct., at 1300. This is a wiser rule than the automatic rule announced by the Court, which requires courts and juries to disregard voluntary admissions which they might well find to be the best possible evidence in discharging their responsibility for ascertaining truth.\n\n\n\n1\n 307 F.2d 62.\n\n\n2\n 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 184a.\n\n\n3\n 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 173, 174.\n\n\n4\n The petitioner's trial was upon a second superseding indictment which had been returned on March 3, 1961, and which included additional counts against him and other defendants. The Court of Appeals reversed his conviction upon a conspiracy count, one judge dissenting, but affirmed his convictions upon three substantive counts, one judge dissenting. 307 F.2d 62.\n\n\n5\n See also People v. Davis, 13 N.Y.2d 690, 241 N.Y.S.2d 172, 191 N.E.2d 674 (1963); People v. Rodriguez, 11 N.Y.2d 279, 229 N.Y.S.2d 353, 183 N.E.2d 651 (1962); People v.

Robinson, 16 A.D.2d 184, 224 N.Y.S.2d 705 (4th Dept. 1962).\n\n\n6\n 'In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.'\n\n\n*\n Today's rule picks up where the Fifth Amendment ends and bars wholly voluntary admissions. I would assume, although one cannot be sure, that the new rule would not have a similar supplemental role in connection with the Fourth Amendment. While the Fifth Amendment bars only compelled incrimination, the Fourth Amendment bars only unreasonable searches. It could be argued, fruitlessly I would hope, that if the police must stay away from the defendant they must also stay away from his house once the right to counsel has attached and that a court must exclude the products of a reasonable search made pursuant to a properly issued warrant but without the consent or presence of the accused's counsel.\n\n\n","label":0}

DOTHARD et al., Appellantsv.Dianne RAWLINSON et al.\nNo. 76-422.\nArgued April 19, 1977.\nDecided June 27, 1977.\n\nSyllabus\nAfter her application for employment as a 'correctional counselor' (prison guard) in Alabama was rejected because she failed to meet the minimum 120-pound weight requirement of an Alabama statute, which also establishes a height minimum of 5 feet 2 inches, appellee Rawlinson (hereafter appellee) filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and ultimately brought a class action against appellant corrections officials challenging the statutory height and weight requirements and a regulation establishing gender criteria for assigning correctional counselors to 'contact' positions (positions requiring close physical proximity to inmates) as violative of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, inter alia. A three-judge District Court decided in appellee's favor. On the basis of national statistics as to the comparative height and weight of men and women indicating that Alabama's statutory standards would exclude over 40% of the female population but less than 1% of the male population, the court found that with respect to such standards appellee had made out a prima facie case of unlawful sex discrimination, which appellants had failed to rebut. The court also found the challenged regulation impermissible under Title VII as being based on stereotyped characterizations of the sexes, and, rejecting appellants' bona-fide-occupational-qualification defense under \u00a7 703(e) of Title VII, ruled that being male was not such a qualification for the job of correctional counselor in a 'contact' position in an Alabama male maximum-security penitentiary. Held:\n1. The District Court did not err in holding that Title VII prohibited application of the statutory height and weight requirements to appellee and the class she represents. Pp. 328-332.\n(a) To establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination, a plaintiff need only show that the facially neutral standards in question, such as Alabama's height and weight standards, select applicants for hire in a significantly discriminatory pattern, and here the showing of the disproportionate impact of the height and weight standards on women based on national statistics, rather than on comparative statistics of actual applicants, sufficed to make out a prima facie case. Pp. 328-331.\n(b) Appellants failed to rebut the prima facie case of discrimination on the basis that the height and weight requirements are job related in that they have a relationship to the strength essential to efficient job performance as a correctional counselor, where appellants produced no evidence correlating such requirements with the requisite amount of strength thought essential to good job performance, and in fact failed to offer evidence of any kind in specific justification of the statutory standards. P. 331.\n2. In the particular circumstances of this case, the District Court erred in rejecting appellants' contention that the regulation in question falls within the narrow ambit of the bona-fide-occupational-qualification exception of \u00a7 703(e), it appearing from the evidence that Alabama maintains a prison system where violence is the order of the day, inmate access to guards is facilitated by dormitory living arrangements, every correctional institution is understaffed, and a substantial portion of the inmate population is composed of sex offenders mixed at random with other prisoners, and that therefore the use of women guards in 'contact' positions in the maximum-security male penitentiaries would pose a substantial security problem, directly linked to the sex of the prison guard.

Horowitz, Montgomery, Ala., for the appellees, pro hac vice, by special leave of Court.\nMr. Justice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nAppellee Dianne Rawlinson sought employment with the Alabama Board of Corrections as a prison guardCalled in Alabama a 'correctional counselor.' After her application was rejected, she brought this class suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq. (1970 ed. and Supp. V), and under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that she had been denied employment because of her sex in violation of federal law. A three-judge Federal District Court for the Middle District of Alabama decided in her favor. Mieth v. Dothard, 418 F.Supp. 1169. We noted probable jurisdiction of this appeal from the District Court's judgment. 429 U.S. 976, 97 S.Ct. 483, 50 L.Ed.2d 583.1\n\n\n2\n* At the time she applied for a position as correctional counselor trainee, Rawlinson was a 22-year-old college graduate whose major course of study had been correctional psychology. She was refused employment because she failed to meet the minimum 120-pound weight requirement established by an Alabama statute. The statute also establishes a height minimum of 5 feet 2 inches.2\n\n\n3\nAfter her application was rejected because of her weight, Rawlinson filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and ultimately received a right-to-sue letter.3 She then filed a complaint in the District Court on behalf of herself and other similarly situated women, challenging the statutory height and weight minima as violative of Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.4 A three-judge court was convened.5 While the suit was pending, the Alabama Board of Corrections adopted Administrative Regulation 204, establishing gender criteria for assigning correctional counselors to maximum-security institutions for 'contact positions,' that is, positions requiring continual close physical proximity to inmates of the institution.6 Rawlinson amended her class-action complaint by adding a challenge to regulation 204 as also violative of Title VII and the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n4\nLike most correctional facilities in the United States,7 Alabama's prisons are segregated on the basis of sex. Currently the Alabama Board of Corrections operates four major all-male penitentiaries Holman Prison, Kilby Corrections Facility, G. K. Fountain Correction Center, and Draper Correctional Center. The Board also operates the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women, the Frank Lee Youth Center, the Number Four Honor Camp, the State Cattle Ranch, and nine Work Release Centers, one of which is for women. The Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women and the four male penitentiaries are maximum-security institutions. Their inmate living quarters are for the most part large dormitories, with communal showers and toilets that are open to the dormitories and hallways. The Draper and Fountain penitentiaries carry on extensive farming operations, making necessary a large number of strip searches for contraband when prisoners re-enter the prison buildings.\n\n\n5\nA correctional counselor's primary duty within these institutions is to maintain security and control of the inmates by continually supervising and observing their activities.8 To be eligible for consideration as a correctional counselor, an applicant must possess a valid Alabama driver's license, have a high school education or its equivalent, be free from physical defects, be between the ages of 20 1\/2 years and 45 years at the time of appointment, and fall between the minimum height and weight requirements of 5 feet 2 inches, and 120 pounds, and the maximum of 6 feet 10 inches, and 300 pounds. Appointment is by merit, with a grade assigned each applicant based on experience and education. No written examination is given.\n\n\n6\nAt the time this litigation was in the District Court, the Board of Corrections employed a total of 435 people in various correctional counselor positions, 56 of whom were women. Of those 56 women, 21 were employed at the Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women, 13 were employed in noncontact positions at the four male maximum-security institutions, and the remaining 22 were employed at the other institutions operated by the Alabama Board of Corrections. Because most of Alabama's prisoners are held at the four maximum-security male penitentiaries, 336 of the 435 correctional counselor jobs were in those institutions, a majority of them concededly in the 'contact' classification.9 Thus, even though meeting the statutory height and weight requirements, women applicants could under Regulation 204 compete equally with men for only about 25% of the correctional counselor jobs available in the Alabama prison system.\n\nII\n\n7\nIn enacting Title VII, Congress required 'the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classification.' Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431, 91 S.Ct. 849, 853, 28 L.Ed.2d 158. The District Court found that the minimum statutory height and weight requirements that applicants for employment as correctional counselors must meet constitute the sort of arbitrary barrier to equal employment opportunity that Title VII forbids.10 The appellants assert that the District Court erred both in finding that the height and weight standards discriminate against women, and in its refusal to find that, even if they do, these standards are justified as 'job related.'\n\n\n8\nThe gist of the claim that the statutory height and weight requirements discriminate against women does not involve an assertion of purposeful discriminatory motive.11 It is asserted, rather, that these facially neutral qualification standards work in fact disproportionately to exclude women from eligibility for employment by the Alabama Board of Corrections. We dealt in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., supra and Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280, with similar allegations that facially neutral employment standards disproportionately excluded Negroes from employment, and those cases guide our approach here.\n\n\n9\nThose cases make clear that to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, a plaintiff need only show that the facially neutral standards in question select applicants for hire in a significantly discriminatory pattern. Once it is thus shown that the employment standards are discriminatory in effect, the employer must meet 'the burden of showing that any given requirement (has) . . . a manifest relationship to the employment in question.' Griggs v. Duke Power Co., supra, at 432, 91 S.Ct., at 854. If the employer proves that the challenged requirements are job related, the plaintiff may then show that other selection devices without a similar discriminatory effect would also 'serve the employer's legitimate interest in 'efficient and trustworthy workmanship.\" Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, supra, at 425, 95 S.Ct., at 2375, quoting McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 801, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1823, 36 L.Ed.2d 668.\n\n\n10\nAlthough women 14 years of age or older compose 52.75% of the Alabama population and 36.89% of its total labor force, they hold only 12.9% of its correctional counselor positions. In considering the effect of the minimum height and weight standards on this disparity in rate of hiring between the sexes, the District Court found that the 5$2$-requirement would operate to exclude 33.29% of the women in the United States between the ages of 18-79, while excluding only 1.28% of men between the same ages. The 120-pound weight restriction would exclude 22.29% of the women and 2.35% of the men in this age group. When the height and weight restrictions are combined, Alabama's statutory standards would exclude 41.13% of the female population while excluding less than 1% of the male population.12 Accordingly, the District Court found that Rawlinson had made out a prima facie case of unlawful sex discrimination.\n\n\n11\nThe appellants argue that a showing of disproportionate impact on women based on generalized national statistics should not suffice to establish a prima facie case. They point in particular to Rawlinson's failure to adduce comparative statistics concerning actual applicants for correctional counselor positions in Alabama. There is no requirement, however, that a statistical showing of disproportionate impact must always be based on analysis of the characteristics of actual applicants. See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., supra, 401 U.S., at 430, 91 S.Ct., at 853. The application process might itself not adequately reflect the actual potential applicant pool, since otherwise qualified people might be discouraged from applying because of a self-recognized inability to meet the very standards challenged as being discriminatory. See International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 365-367, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1869-1871, 52 L.Ed.2d 396. A potential applicant could easily determine her height and weight and conclude that to make an application would be futile. Moreover, reliance on general population demographic data was not misplaced where there was no reason to suppose that physical height and weight characteristics of Alabama men and women differ markedly from those of the national population.\n\n\n12\nFor these reasons, we cannot say that the District Court was wrong in holding that the statutory height and weight standards had a discriminatory impact on women applicants. The plaintiffs in a case such as this are not required to exhaust every possible source of evidence, if the evidence actually presented on its face conspicuously demonstrates a job requirement's grossly discriminatory impact. If the employer discerns fallacies or deficiencies in the data offered by the plaintiff, he is free to adduce countervailing evidence of his own. In this case no such effort was made.13\n\nB\n\n13\nWe turn, therefore, to the appellants' argument that they have rebutted the prima facie case of discrimination by showing that the height and weight requirements are job related. These requirements, they say, have a relationship to strength, a sufficient but unspecified amount of which is essential to effective job performance as a correctional counselor. In the District Court, however, the appellants produced no evidence correlating the height and weight requirements with the requisite amount of strength thought essential to good job performance. Indeed, they failed to offer evidence of any kind in specific justification of the statutory standards.14\n\n\n14\nIf the job-related quality that the appellants identify is bona fide, their purpose could be achieved by adopting and validating a test for applicants that measures strength directly.15 Such a test, fairly administered, would fully satisfy the standards of Title VII because it would be one that 'measure(s) the person for the job and not the person in the abstract.' Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S., at 436, 91 S.Ct., at 856. But nothing in the present record even approaches such a measurement.\n\n\n15\nFor the reasons we have discussed, the District Court was not in error in holding that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, prohibits application of the statutory height and weight requirements to Rawlinson and the class she represents.\n\nIII\n\n16\nUnlike the statutory height and weight requirements, Regulation 204 explicitly discriminates against women on the basis of their sex.16 In defense of this overt discrimination, the appellants rely on \u00a7 703(e) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(e), which permits sex-based discrimination 'in those certain instances where . . . sex . . . is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise.'\n\n\n17\nThe District Court rejected the bona-fideoccupational-qualification (bfoq) defense, relying on the virtually uniform view of the federal courts that \u00a7 703(e) provides only the narrowest of exceptions to the general rule requiring equality of employment opportunities. This view has been variously formulated. In Diaz v. Pan American World Airways, 442 F.2d 385, 388, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that 'discrimination based on sex is valid only when the essence of the business operation would be undermined by not hiring members of one sex exclusively.' (Emphasis in original.) In an earlier case, Weeks v. Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Co., 5 Cir., 408 F.2d 228, 235, the same court said that an employer could rely on the bfoq exception only by proving 'that he had reasonable cause to believe, that is, a factual basis for believing, that all or substantially all women would be unable to perform safely and efficiently the duties of the job involved.' See also Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U.S. 542, 91 S.Ct. 496, 27 L.Ed.2d 613. But whatever the verbal formulation, the federal courts have agreed that it is impermissible under Title VII to refuse to hire an individual woman or man on the basis of stereotyped characterizations of the sexes,17 and the District Court in the present case held in effect that Regulation 204 is based on just such stereotypical assumptions.\n\n\n18\nWe are persuaded by the restrictive language of \u00a7 703(e), the relevant legislative history,18 and the consistent interpretation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission19 that the bfoq exception was in fact meant to be an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex.20 In the particular factual circumstances of this case, however, we conclude that the District Court erred in rejecting the State's contention that Regulation 204 falls within the narrow ambit of the bfoq exception.\n\n\n19\nThe environment in Alabama's penitentiaries is a peculiarly inhospitable one for human beings of whatever sex. Indeed, a Federal District Court has held that the conditions of confinement in the prisons of the State, characterized by 'rampant violence' and a 'jungle atmosphere,' are constitutionally intolerable. Pugh v. Locke, 406 F.Supp. 318, 325 (MD Ala.). The record in the present case shows that because of inadequate staff and facilities, no attempt is made in the four maximum-security male penitentiaries to classify or segregate inmates according to their offense or level of dangerousness a procedure that, according to expert testimony, is essential to effective penological administration. Consequently, the estimated 20% of the male prisoners who are sex offenders are scattered throughout the penitentiaries' dormitory facilities.\n\n\n20\nIn this environment of violence and disorganization, it would be an oversimplification to characterize Regulation 204 as an exercise in 'romantic paternalism.' Cf. Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 684, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 1769, 36 L.Ed.2d 583. In the usual case, the argument that a particular job is too dangerous for women may appropriately be met by the rejoinder that it is the purpose of Title VII to allow the individual woman to make that choice for herself.21 More is at stake in this case, however, than an individual woman's decision to weigh and accept the risks of employment in a 'contact' position in a maximum-security male prison.\n\n\n21\nThe essence of a correctional counselor's job is to maintain prison security. A woman's relative ability to maintain order in a male, maximum-security, unclassified penitentiary of the type Alabama now runs could be directly reduced by her womanhood. There is a basis in fact for expecting that sex offenders who have criminally assaulted women in the past would be moved to do so again if access to women were established within the prison. There would also be a real risk that other inmates, deprived of a normal heterosexual environment, would assault women guards because they were women.22 In a prison system where violence is the order of the day, where inmate access to guards is facilitated by dormitory living arrangements, where every institution is understaffed, and where a substantial portion of the inmate population is composed of sex offenders mixed at random with other prisoners, there are few visible deterrents to inmate assaults on women custodians.\n\n\n22\nAppellee Rauwlinson's own expert testified that dormitory housing for aggressive inmates poses a greater security problem than single-cell lockups, and further testified that it would be unwise to use women as guards in a prison where even 10% of the inmates had been convicted of sex crimes and were not segregated from the other prisoners.23 The likelihood that inmates would assault a woman because she was a woman would pose a real threat not only to the victim of the assault but also to the basic control of the penitentiary and protection of its inmates and the other security personnel. The employee's very womanhood would thus directly undermine her capacity to provide the security that is the essence of a correctional counselor's responsibility.\n\n\n23\nThere was substantial testimony from experts on both sides of this litigation that the use of women as guards in 'contact' positions under the existing conditions in Alabama maximum-security male penitentiaries would pose a substantial security problem, directly linked to the sex of the prison guard. On the basis of that evidence, we conclude that the District Court was in error in ruling that being male is not a bona fide occupational qualification for the job of correctional counselor in a 'contact' position in an Alabama male maximum-security penitentiary.24\n\n\n24\nThe judgment is accordingly affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n25\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n26\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice BLACKMUN join, concurring in the result and concurring in part.\n\n\n27\nI agree with, and join, Parts I and III of the Court's opinion in this case and with its judgment. While I also agree with the Court's conclusion in Part II of its opinion, holding that the District Court was 'not in error' in holding the statutory height and weight requirements in this case to be invalidated by Title VII, ante, at 332, the issues with which that Part deals are bound to arise so frequently that I feel obliged to separately state the reasons for my agreement with its result. I view affirmance of the District Court in this respect as essentially dictated by the peculiarly limited factual and legal justifications offered below by appellants on behalf of the statutory requirements. For that reason, I do not believe and do not read the Court's opinion as holding that all or even many of the height and weight requirements imposed by States on applicants for a multitude of law enforcement agency jobs are pretermitted by today's decision.\n\n\n28\nI agree that the statistics relied upon in this case are sufficient, absent rebuttal, to sustain a finding of a prima facie violation of \u00a7 703(a)(2), in that they reveal a significant discrepancy between the numbers of men, as opposed to women, who are automatically disqualified by reason of the height and weight requirements. The fact that these statistics are national figures of height and weight, as opposed to statewide or pool-of-labor-force statistics, does not seem to me to require us to hold that the District Court erred as a matter of law in admitting them into evidence. See Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 108, 124-125, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2902, 2911-2912, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974); cf. Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine, 395 U.S. 100, 123-125, 89 S.Ct. 1562, 1576-1578, 23 L.Ed.2d 129 (1969). It is for the District Court, in the first instance, to determine whether these statistics appear sufficiently probative of the ultimate fact in issue whether a given job qualification requirement has a disparate impact on some group protected by Title VII. Hazelwood School District v. United States, 433 U.S., 299, at 312-313, 97 S.Ct. 2736, at 2744, 53 L.Ed.2d 768; see Hamling v. United States, supra, 418 U.S., at 108, 124-125, 94 S.Ct., at 2902, 2911-2912; Mayor v. Educational Equality League, 415 U.S. 605, 621 n. 20, 94 S.Ct. 1323, 1333, 39 L.Ed.2d 630 (1974); see also McAllister v. United States, 348 U.S. 19, 75 S.Ct. 6, 99 L.Ed. 20 (1954); United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 338 U.S. 338, 340-342, 70 S.Ct. 177, 178-179, 94 L.Ed. 150 (1949). In making this determination, such statistics are to be considered in light of all other relevant facts and circumstances. Cf. Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 340, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1857, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977). The statistics relied on here do not suffer from the obvious lack of relevancy of the statistics relied on by the District Court in Hazelwood School District v. United States, 433 U.S., at 308, 97 S.Ct., at 2742. A reviewing court cannot say as a matter of law that they are irrelevant to the contested issue or so lacking in reliability as to be inadmissible.\n\n\n29\nIf the defendants in a Title VII suit believe there to be reason to discredit plaintiffs' statistics that does not appear on their face, the opportunity to challenge them is available to the defendants just as in any other lawsuit. They may endeavor to impeach the reliability of the statistical evidence, they may offer rebutting evidence, or they may disparage in arguments or in briefs the probative weight which the plaintiffs' evidence should be accorded. Since I agree with the Court that appellants made virtually no such effort, ante, at 331, I also agree with it that the District Court cannot be said to have erred as a matter of law in finding that a prima facie case had been made out in the instant case.\n\n\n30\nWhile the District Court's conclusion is by no means required by the proffered evidence, I am unable to conclude that the District Court's finding in that respect was clearly erroneous. In other cases there could be different evidence which could lead a district court to conclude that height and weight are in fact an accurate enough predictor of strength to justify, under all the circumstances, such minima. Should the height and weight requirements be found to advance the job-related qualification of strength sufficiently to rebut the prima facie case, then, under our cases, the burden would shift back to appellee Rawlinson to demonstrate that other tests, without such disparate effect, would also meet that concern. Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 425, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 2375, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975). But, here, the District Court permissible concluded that appellants had not shown enough of a nexus even to rebut the inference.\n\n\n31\nAppellants, in order to rebut the prima facie case under the statute, had the burden placed on them to advance job-related reasons for the qualification. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). This burden could be shouldered by offering evidence or by making legal arguments not dependent on any new evidence. The District Court was confronted, however, with only one suggested job-related reason for the qualification that of strength. Appellants argued only the job-relatedness of actual physical strength; they did not urge that an equally job-related qualification for prison guards is the appearance of strength. As the Court notes, the primary job of correctional counselor in Alabama prisons 'is to maintain security and control of the inmates . . .,' ante, at 326, a function that I at least would imagine is aided by the psychological impact on prisoners of the presence of tall and heavy guards. If the appearance of strength had been urged upon the District Court here as a reason for the height and weight minima, I think that the District Court would surely have been entitled to reach a different result than it did. For, even if not perfectly correlated, I would think that Title VII would not preclude a State from saying that anyone under 5$2$ or 120 pounds, no matter how strong in fact, does not have a sufficient appearance of strength to be a prison guard.\n\n\n32\nBut once the burden has been placed on the defendant, it is then up to the defendant to articulate the asserted job-related reasons underlying the use of the minima. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, supra, at 802, 93 S.Ct., at 1824; Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431, 91 S.Ct. 849, 853, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971); Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, supra, 422 U.S., at 425, 95 S.Ct., at 2375. Because of this burden, a reviewing court is not ordinarily justified in relying on arguments in favor of a job qualification that were not first presented to the trial court. Cf. United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365, 374 n. 5, 87 S.Ct. 1856, 1863, 18 L.Ed.2d 1249 (1967); Thomas v. Taylor, 224 U.S. 73, 84, 32 S.Ct. 403, 406, 56 L.Ed. 673 (1912); Bell v. Bruen, 1 How. 169, 187, 11 L.Ed. 89 (1843). As appellants did not even present the 'appearance of strength' contention to the District Court as an asserted job-related reason for the qualification requirements, I agree that their burden was not met. The District Court's holding thus did not deal with the question of whether such an assertion could or did rebut appellee Rawlinson's prima facie case.\n\n\n33\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\n34\nI agree entirely with the Court's analysis of Alabama's height and weight requirements for prison guards, and with its finding that these restrictions discriminate on the basis of sex in violation of Title VII. Accordingly, I join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion. I also agree with much of the Court's general discussion in Part III of the bona-fide-occupationalqualification exception contained in \u00a7 703(e) of Title VII.1 The Court is unquestionably correct when it holds 'that the bfoq exception was in fact meant to be an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex.' Ante, at 334. See Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U.S. 542, 544, 91 S.Ct. 496, 497, 27 L.Ed.2d 613 (1971) (Marshall, J., concurring). I must, however, respectfully disagree with the Court's application of the bfoq exception in this case.\n\n\n35\nThe Court properly rejects two proffered justifications for denying women jobs as prison guards. It is simply irrelevant here that a guard's occupation is dangerous and that some women might be unable to protect themselves adequately. Those themes permeate the testimony of the state officials below, but as the Court holds, 'the argument that a particular job is too dangerous for women' is refuted by the 'purpose of Title VII to allow the individual woman to make that choice for herself.' Ante, at 335. Some women, like some men, undoubtedly are not qualified and do not wish to serve as prison guards, but that does not justify the exclusion of all women from this employment opportunity. Thus, '(i)n the usual case,' ibid., the Court's interpretation of the bfoq exception would mandate hiring qualified women for guard jobs in maximum-security institutions. The highly successful experiences of other States allowing such job opportunities, see briefs for the States of California and Washington, as amici curiae, confirm that absolute disqualification of women is not, in the words of Title VII, 'reasonably necessary to the normal operation' of a maximum security prison.\n\n\n36\nWhat would otherwise be considered unlawful discrimination against women is justified by the Court, however, on the basis of the 'barbaric and inhumane' conditions in Alabama prisons, conditions so bad that state officials have conceded that they violate the Constitution. See Pugh v. Locke, 406 F.Supp. 318, 329, 331 (MD Ala.1976). To me, this analysis sounds distressingly like saying two wrongs make a right. It is refuted by the plain words of \u00a7 703(e). The statute requires that a bfoq be 'reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise.' But no governmental 'business' may operate 'normally' in violation of the Constitution. Every action of government is constrained by constitutional limitations. While those limits may be violated more frequently than we would wish, no one disputes that the 'normal operation' of all government functions takes place within them. A prison system operating in blatant violation of the Eighth Amendment is an exception that should be remedied with all possible speed, as Judge Johnson's comprehensive order in Puch v. Locke, supra, is designed to do. In the meantime, the existence of such violations should not be legitimatized by calling them 'normal.' Nor should the Court accept them as justifying conduct that would otherwise violate a statute intended to remedy age-old discrimination.\n\n\n37\nThe Court's error in statutory construction is less objectionable, however, than the attitude it displays toward women. Though the Court recognizes that possible harm to women guards is an unacceptable reason for disqualifying women, it relies instead on an equally speculative threat to prison discipline supposedly generated by the sexuality of female guards. There is simply no evidence in the record to show that women guards would create any danger to security in Alabama prisons significantly greater than that which already exists. All of the dangers with one exception discussed below are inherent in a prison setting, whatever the gender of the guards.\n\n\n38\nThe Court first sees women guards as a threat to security because 'there are few visible deterrents to inmate assaults on women custodians.' Ante, at 336. In fact, any prison guard is constantly subject to the threat of attack by inmates, and 'invisible' deterrents are the guard's only real protection. No prison guard relies primarily on his or her ability to ward off an inmate attack to maintain order. Guards are typically unarmed and sheer numbers of inmates could overcome the normal complement. Rather, like all other law enforcement officers, prison guards must rely primarily on the moral authority of their office and the threat of future punishment for miscreants. As one expert testified below, common sense, fairness, and mental and emotional stability are the qualities a guard needs to cope with the dangers of the job. App. 81. Well qualified and properly trained women, no less than men, have these psychological weapons at their disposal.\n\n\n39\nThe particular severity of discipline problems in the Alabama maximum-security prisons is also no justification for the discrimination sanctioned by the Court. The District Court found in Pugh v. Locke, supra, that guards 'must spend all their time attempting to maintain control or to protect themselves.' 406 F.Supp., at 325. If male guards face an impossible situation, it is difficult to see how women could make the problem worse, unless one relies on precisely the type of generalized bias against women that the Court agrees Title VII was intended to outlaw. For example, much of the testimony of appellants' witnesses ignores individual differences among members of each sex and reads like 'ancient canards about the proper role of women.' Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U.S., at 545, 91 S.Ct., at 498. The witnesses claimed that women guards are not strict disciplinarians; that they are physically less capable of protecting themselves and subduing unruly inmates; that inmates take advantage of them as they did their monthers, while male guards are strong father figures who easily maintain discipline, and so on.2 Yet the record shows that the presence of women guards has not led to a single incident amounting to a serious breach of security in any Alabama institution.3 And, in any event, '(g)uards rarely enter the cell blocks and dormitories,' Pugh v. Locke, 406 F.Supp., at 325, where the danger of inmate attacks is the greatest.\n\n\n40\nIt appears that the real disqualifying factor in the Court's view is '(t)he employee's very womanhood.' Ante, at 336. The Court refers to the large number of sex offenders in Alabama prisons, and to '(t)he likelihood that inmates would assault a woman because she was a woman.' Ibid. In short, the fundamental justification for the decision is that women as guards will generate sexual assaults. With all respect, this rationale regrettably perpetuates one of the most insidious of the old myths about women that women, wittingly or not, are seductive sexual objects. The effect of the decision, made I am sure with the best of intentions, is to punish women because their very presence might provoke sexual assaults. It is women who are made to pay the price in lost job opportunities for the threat of depraved conduct by prison inmates. Once again, '(t)he pedestal upon which women have been placed has . . ., upon closer inspection, been revealed as a cage.' Sail'er Inn, Inc. v. Kirby, 5 Cal.3d 1, 20, 95 Cal.Rptr. 329, 341, 485 P.2d 529, 541 (1971). It is particularly ironic that the cage is erected here in response to feared misbehavior by imprisoned criminals.4\n\n\n41\nThe Court points to no evidence in the record to support the asserted 'likelihood that inmates would assault a woman because she was a woman.' Ante, at 336. Perhaps the Court relies upon common sense, or 'innate recognition.' Brief for Appellants 51. But the danger in this emotionally laden context is that common sense will be used to mask the \"romantic paternalism\" and persisting discriminatory attitudes that the Court properly eschews. Ante, at 335. To me, the only matter of innate recognition is that the incidence of sexually motivated attacks on guards will be minute compared to the 'likelihood that inmates will assault' a guard because he or she is a guard.\n\n\n42\nThe proper response to inevitable attacks on both female and male guards is not to limit the employment opportunities of lawabiding women who wish to contribute to their community, but to take swift and sure punitive action against the inmate offenders. Presumably, one of the goals of the Alabama prison system is the eradication of inmates' antisocial behavior patterns so that prisoners will be able to live one day in free society. Sex offenders can begin this process by learning to relate to women guards in a socially acceptable manner. To deprive women of job opportunities because of the threatened behavior of convicted criminals is to turn our social priorities upside down.5\n\n\n43\nAlthough I do not countenance the sex discrimination condoned by the majority, it is fortunate that the Court's decision is carefully limited to the facts before it. I trust the lower courts will recognize that the decision was impelled by the shockingly inhuman conditions in Alabama prisons, and thus that the 'extremely narrow (bfoq) exception' recognized here, ante, at 334, will not be allowed 'to swallow the rule' against sex discrimination. See Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp., 400 U.S., at 545, 91 S.Ct., at 498. Expansion of today's decision beyond its narrow factual basis would erect a serious roadblock to economic equality for women.\n\n\n\n1\n The appellants sought to raise for the first time in their brief on the merits the claim that Congress acted unconstitutionally in extending Title VII's coverage to state governments. See the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 103, effective date, Mar. 24, 1972, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e(a), (b), (f), (h) (1970 ed., Supp. V). Not having been raised in the District Court, that issue is not before us. See Adickes v. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 147 n. 2, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1602, 26 L.Ed.2d 142; Irvine v. California, 347 U.S. 128, 129, 74 S.Ct. 381, 98 L.Ed. 561.\n\n\n2\n The statute establishes minimum physical standards for all law enforcement officers. In pertinent part, it provides:\n'(d) Physical qualifications. The applicant shall be not less than five feet two inches nor more than six feet ten inches in height, shall weigh not less than 120 pounds nor more than 300 pounds and shall be certified by a licensed physician designated as satisfactory by the appointing authority as in good health and physically fit for the performance of his duties as a law-enforcement officer. The commission may for good cause shown permit variances from the physical qualifications prescribed in this subdivision.' Ala.Code, Tit. 55, \u00a7 373(109) (Supp. 1973).\n\n\n3\n See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f) (1970 ed., Supp. V).\n\n\n4\n A second plaintiff named in the complaint was Brenda Mieth, who, on behalf of herself and others similarly situated, challenged the 5$9$ height and 160-pound weight requirements for the position of Alabama state trooper as violative of the Equal Protection Clause. The District Court upheld her challenge, and the defendants did not appeal from that aspect of the District Court's judgment.\n\n\n5\n Although a single-judge District Court could have considered Rawlinson's Title VII claims, her coplaintiff's suit rested entirely on the Constitution. See n. 4, supra. Given the similarity of the underlying issues in the two cases, it was not inappropriate to convene a three-judge court to deal with the constitutional and statutory issues presented in the complaint. When a properly convened three-judge court enjoins the operation of a state law on federal statutory grounds, an appeal to this Court from that judgment lies under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253. See Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., 382 U.S. 423, 86 S.Ct. 594, 15 L.Ed.2d 501; Philbrook v. Glodgett, 421 U.S. 707, 95 S.Ct. 1893, 44 L.Ed.2d 525.\n\n\n6\n Administrative Regulation 204 provides in pertinent part as follows:\n'I. GENERAL\n'1. The purpose of this regulation is to establish policy and procedure for identifying and designating institutional Correctional Counselor I positions which require selective certification for appointment of either male or female employees from State Personnel Department registers.\n'II. POLICY\n'4. All Correctional Counselor I positions will be evaluated to identify and designate those which require selective certification for appointment of either a male or female employee. Such positions must fall within a bona fide occupational qualification stated in Title 4(2)-2000c of the United States Code . . ..\n'5. Selective certification from the Correctional Counselor Trainee register will be requested of the State Personnel Department whenever a position is being filled which has been designated for either a male or female employee only.\n'III. PROCEDURE\n'8. Institutional Wardens and Directors will identify each institutional Correctional Counselor I position which they feel requires selective certification and will request that it be so designated in writing to the Associate Commissioner for Administration for his review, evaluation, and submission to the Commissioner for final decision.\n'9. The request will contain the exact duties and responsibilities of the position and will utilize and identify the following criteria to establish that selective certification is necessary;\n'A. That the presence of the opposite sex would cause disruption of the orderly running and security of the institution.\n'B. That the position would require contact with the inmates of the opposite sex without the presence of others.\n'C. That the position would require patroling dormitories, restrooms, or showers while in use, frequently, during the day or night.\n'D. That the position would require search of inmates of the opposite sex on a regular basis.\n'E. That the position would require that the Correctional Counselor Trainee not be armed with a firearm.\n'10. All institutional Correctional Counselor I positions which are not approved for selective certification will be filled from Correctional Counselor Trainee registers without regard to sex.'\nAlthough Regulation 204 is not limited on its face to contact positions in maximum-security institutions, the District Court found that it did not 'preclude . . . (women) from serving in contact positions in the all-male institutions other than the penitentiaries.' 418 F.Supp., at 1176. Appellants similarly defended the regulation as applying only to maximum-security facilities.\n\n\n7\n Note, The Sexual Segregation of American Prisons, 82 Yale L.J. 1229 (1973).\n\n\n8\n The official job description for a correctional counselor position emphasizes counseling as well as security duties; the District Court found: '(C)orrectional counselors are persons who are commonly referred to as prison guards. Their duties primarily involve security rather than counseling.' 418 F.Supp. 1169, 1175.\n\n\n9\n At the time of the trial the Board of Corrections had not yet classified all of its correctional counselor positions in the maximum-security institutions according to the criteria established in Regulation 204; consequently evidence of the exact number of 'male only' jobs within the prison system was not available.\n\n\n10\n Section 703(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a) (1970 ed. and Supp. V), provides:\n'(a) Employer practices. It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\n'(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or\n'(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any was which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.'\n\n\n11\n See International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States 431 U.S. 324, 335-336 n. 15, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1854, 52 L.Ed.2d 396.\n\n\n12\n Affirmatively stated, approximately 99.76% of the men and 58.87% of the women meet both these physical qualifications. From the separate statistics on height and weight of males it would appear that after adding the two together and allowing for some overlap the result would be to exclude between 2.35% and 3.63% of males from meeting Alabama's statutory height and weight minima. None of the parties has challenged the accuracy of the District Court's computations on this score, however, and the discrepancy is in any event insignificant in light of the gross disparity between the female and male exclusions. Even under revised computations the disparity would greatly exceed the 34% to 12% disparity that served to invalidate the high school diploma requirement in the Griggs case. 401 U.S., at 430, 91 S.Ct., at 853.\n\n\n13\n The height and weight statute contains a waiver provision that the appellants urge saves it from attack under Title VII. See n. 2, supra. The District Court noted that a valid waiver provision might indeed have that effect, but found that applicants were not informed of the waiver provision, and that the Board of Corrections had never requested a waiver from the Alabama Peace Officers' Standards and Training Commission. The court therefore correctly concluded that the waiver provision as administered failed to overcome the discriminatory effect of the statute's basic provisions.\n\n\n14\n In what is perhaps a variation on their constitutional challenge to the validity of Title VII itself, see n. 1, supra, the appellants contend that the establishment of the minimum height and weight standards by statute requires that they be given greater deference than is typically given private employer-established job qualifications. The relevant legislative history of the 1972 amendments extending Title VII to the States as employers does not, however, support such a result. Instead, Congress expressly indicated the intent that the same Title VII principles be applied to governmental and private employers alike. See H.R.Rep.No.92-238, p. 17 (1971); S.Rep.No.92-415, p. 10 (1971); U.S. Code Cong. & Admin.News 1972, p. 2137. See also Schaeffer v. San Diego Yellow Cabs, 462 F.2d 1002 (CA9). Thus for both private and public employers, '(t)he touchstone is business necessity,' Griggs, 401 U.S., at 431, 91 S.Ct., at 853; a discriminatory employment practice must be shown to be necessary to safe and efficient job performance to survive a Title VII challenge.\n\n\n15\n Cf. EEOC Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, 29 CFR \u00a7 1607 (1976). See also Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 246-247, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2050-2051, 48 L.Ed.2d 597; Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280; Officers for Justice v. civil Service Commission, 395 F.Supp. 378 (ND Cal.).\n\n\n16\n By its terms Regulation 204 applies to contact positions in both male and female institutions. See n. 6, supra. The District Court found, however, that 'Regulation 204 is the administrative means by which the (Board of Corrections') policy of not hiring women as correctional counselors in contact positions in all-male penitentiaries has been implemented.' 418 F.Supp., at 1176. The Regulation excludes women from consideration for approximately 75% of the available correctional counselor jobs in the Alabama prison system.\n\n\n17\n See, e. g., Gillin v. Federal Paper Board Co., 479 F.2d 97 (CA2); Jurinko v. Edwin L. Wiegand Co., 477 F.2d 1038 (CA3); Rosenfeld v. Southern Pacific Co., 444 F.2d 1219 (CA9); Bowe v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 416 F.2d 711 (CA7); Meadows v. Ford Motor Co., 62 F.R.D. 98 (WD Ky.), modified on other grounds, 510 F.2d 939 (CA6). See also Jones Metal Products Co. v. Walker, 29 Ohio St.2d 173, 281 N.E.2d 1; EEOC Guidelines on Discrimination Because of Sex, 29 CFR \u00a7 1604 (1976).\n\n\n18\n See Interpretative Memorandum of Senators Clark and Case, 110 Cong.Rec. 7213 (1964).\n\n\n19\n The EEOC issued guidelines on sex discrimination in 1965 reflecting its position that 'the bona fide occupational qualification as to sex should be interpreted narrowly.' 29 CFR \u00a7 1604.2(a). It has adhered to that principle consistently, and its construction of the statute can accordingly be given weight. See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S., at 434, 91 S.Ct., at 855; McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Co., 427 U.S. 273, 279-280, 96 S.Ct. 2574, 2577-2578, 49 L.Ed.2d 493.\n\n\n20\n In the case of a state employer, the bfoq exception would have to be interpreted at the very least so as to conform to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The parties do not suggest, however, that the Equal Protection Clause requires more rigorous scrutiny of a State's sexually discriminatory employment policy than does Title VII. There is thus no occasion to give independent consideration to the District Court's ruling that Regulation 204 violates the Fourteenth Amendment as well as Title VII.\n\n\n21\n See, e. g., Weeks v. Southern Bell Telephone & Telegraph Co., 408 F.2d 228, 232-236 (CA5); Bowe v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., supra, 416 F.2d, at 717-718, Rosenfeld v. Southern Pacific Co., supra.\n\n\n22\n The record contains evidence of an attack on a female clerical worker in an Alabama prison, and of an incident involving a woman student who was taken hostage during a visit to one of the maximum-security institutions.\n\n\n23\n Alabama's penitentiaries are evidently not typical. Appellee Rawlinson's two experts testified that in a normal, relatively stable maximum-security prison characterized by control over the inmates, reasonable living conditions, and segregation of dangerous offenders women guards could be used effectively and beneficially. Similarly, an amicus brief filed by the State of California attests to that State's success in using women guards in all-male penitentiaries.\n\n\n24\n The record shows, by contrast, that Alabama's minimum-security facilities, such as work-release centers, are recognized by their inmates as privileged confinement situations not to be lightly jeopardized by disobeying applicable rules of conduct. Inmates assigned to these institutions are thought to be the 'cream of the crop' of the Alabama prison population.\n\n\n1\n Section 703(e), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(e), provides in pertinent part:\n'(1) it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to hire and employ employees . . . on the basis of . . . sex . . . in those certain instain instances where . . . sex . . . is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise . . ..'\n\n\n2\n See, e. g., App. 111-112, 117-118, 144, 147, 151-153, 263-264, 290-292, 301-302. The State Commissioner of Corrections summed up these prejudices in his testimony:\n'Q Would a male that is 5$6$, 140 lbs., be able to perform the job of Correctional Counselor in an all male institution?\n'A Well, if he qualifies otherwise, yes.\n'Q But a female 5$6$, 140 lbs., would not be able to perform all the duties?\n'A No.\n'Q What do you use as a basis for that opinion?\n'A The innate intention between a male and a female. The physical capabilities, the emotions that go into the psychic make-up of a female vs. the psychic make-up of a male. The attitude of the rural type inmate we have vs. that of a woman. The superior feeling that a man has, historically, over that of a female.' Id., at 153.\nStrikingly similar sentiments were expressed a century ago by a Justice of this Court in a case long since discredited:\n'I am not prepared to say that it is one of (women's) fundamental rights and privileges to be admitted into every office and position, including those which require highly special qualifications and demanding special responsibilities. . . . (I)n my opinion, in view of the particular characteristics, destiny, and mission of woman, it is within the province of the legislature to ordain what offices, positions, and callings shall be filled and discharged by men, and shall receive the benefit of those energies and responsibilities, and that decision and firmness which are presumed to predominate in the sterner sex.' Bradwell v. Illinois, 16 Wall. 130, 139, 142, 21 L.Ed. 442 (1873) (Bradley, J., concurring).\n\n\n3\n The Court refers to two incidents involving potentially dangerous attacks on women in prisons. Ante, at 335-336, n. 22. But these did not involve trained corrections officers; one victim was a clerical worker and the other a student visiting on a tour.\n\n\n4\n The irony is multiplied by the fact that enormous staff increases are required by the District Court's order in Pugh v. Locke, 406 F.Supp. 318 (M.D.Ala.1976). This necessary hiring would be a perfect opportunity for appellants to remedy their past discrimination against women, but instead the Court's decision permits that policy to continue. Moreover, once conditions are improved in accordance with the Pugh order, the problems that the Court perceives with women guards will be substantially alleviated.\n\n\n5\n The appellants argue that restrictions on employment of women are also justified by consideration of inmates' privacy. It is strange indeed to hear state officials who have for years been violating the most basic principles of human decency in the operation of their prisons suddenly become concerned about inmate privacy. It is stranger still that these same officials allow women guards in contact positions in a number of nonmaximum-security institutions, but strive to protect inmates' privacy in the prisons where personal freedom is most severely restricted. I have no doubt on this record that appellants' professed concern is nothing but a feeble excuse for discrimination.\nAs the District Court suggested, it may well be possible, once a constitutionally adequate staff is available, to rearrange work assignments so that legitimate inmate privacy concerns are respected without denying jobs to women. Finally, if women guards behave in a professional manner at all times, they will engender reciprocal respect from inmates, who will recognize that their privacy is being invaded no more than if a woman doctor examines them. The suggestion implicit in the privacy argument that such behavior is unlikely on either side is an insult to the professionalism of guards and the dignity of inmates.\n\n\n","label":1}

Appellee was neither involved in nor aware of a lessee's wrongful use of the yacht. Appellee then brought suit challenging the constitutionality of the statutory scheme. A three-judge District Court, relying principally on Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556, held that the statutes' failure to provide for preseizure notice and hearing rendered them unconstitutional and that, as applied to forfeit appellee's interest in the yacht, they unconstitutionally deprived an innocent party of property without just compensation. Held:\n1. The statutes of Puerto Rico are 'State statute(s)' for purposes of the Three-Judge Court Act, and hence a three-judge court was properly convened under that Act and direct appeal to this Court was proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253. Pp. 669\u2014676.\n2. This case presents and 'extraordinary' situation in which postponement of notice and hearing until after seizure did not deny due process, since (1) seizure under the statutes serves significant governmental purposes by permitting Puerto Rico to assert in rem jurisdiction over the property in forfeiture proceedings, thereby fostering the public interest in preventing continued illicit use of the property and in enforcing criminal sanctions; (2) preseizure notice and hearing might frustrate the interests served by the statutes, the property seized often being of the sort, as here, that could be removed from the jurisdiction, destroyed, or concealed, if advance notice were given; and (3), unlike the situation in Fuentes v. Shevin, supra, seizure is not initiated by self-interested private parties but by government officials. Pp. 676\u2014680.\n3. Statutory forfeiture schemes are not rendered unconstitutional because of their applicability to the property interests of innocents, and here the Puerto Rican statutes, which further punitive and deterrent purposes, were validly applied to appellee's yacht. Pp. 680\u2014690.\n363 F.Supp. 1337, reversed.\nLynn R. Coleman for appellants.\nGustavo A. Gelpi, San Juan, P.R., for appellee.\nMr. Justice BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe question presented is whether the Constitution is violated by application to appellee, the lessor of a yacht, of Puerto Rican statutes providing for seizure and forfeiture of vessels used for unlawful purposes when (1) the yacht was seized without prior notice or hearing after allegedly being used by a lessee for an unlawful purpose, and (2) the appellee was neither involved in nor aware of the act of the lessee which resulted in the forfeiture.\n\n\n2\nIn March 1971, appellee, Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., leased a pleasure yacht to two Puerto Rican residents. Puerto Rican authorities discovered marihuana on board the yacht in early May 1972, and charged one of the lessees with violation of the Controlled Substances Act of Puerto Rico, P.R.Laws Ann., Tit. 24, \u00a7 2101 et seq. (Supp.1973). On July 11, 1972, the Superintendent of Police seized the yacht pursuant to P.R.Laws Ann., Tit. 24, \u00a7\u00a7 2512(a)(4), (b) (Supp.1973),1 and Tit. 34, \u00a7 1722 (1971),2 which provide that vessels used to transport, or to facilitate the transportation of, controlled substances, including marihuana, are subject to seizure and forfeiture to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The vessel was seized without prior notice to appellee or either lessee and without a prior adversary hearing. The lessees, who had registered the yacht with the Ports Authority of the Commonwealth, were thereafter given notice within 10 days of the seizure, as required by \u00a7 1722(a).3 But when a challenge to the seizure was not made within 15 days after service of the notice, the yacht was forfeited for official use of the Government of Puerto Rico pursuant to \u00a7 1722(c).4 Appellee shortly thereafter first learned of the seizure and forfeiture when attempting to repossess the yacht from the lessees, because of their apparent failure to pay rent. It is conceded that appellee was 'in no way . . . involved in the criminal enterprise carried on by (the) lessee' and 'had no knowledge that its property was being used in connection with or in violation of (Puerto Rican Law).'\n\n\n3\nOn November 6, 1972, appellee filed this suit, seeking a declaration that application of P.R.Laws Ann., Tit. 24, \u00a7\u00a7 2512(a)(4), (b), and Tit. 34, \u00a7 1722, had (1) unconstitutionally denied it due process of law insofar as the statutes authorized appellants, the Superintendent of Police and the Chief of the Office of Transportation of the Commonwealth, to seize the yacht without notice or a prior adversary hearing, and (2) unconstitutionally deprived appellee of its property without just compensation.5 Injunctive relief was also sought.\n\n\n4\nA three-judge District Court,6 relying principally upon Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972), held that the failure of the statutes to provide for preseizure notice and hearing rendered them constitutionally defective. 363 F.Supp. 1337, 1342\u20141343 (PR 1973). Viewing United States v. United States Coin & Currency, 401 U.S. 715, 91 S.Ct. 1041, 28 L.Ed.2d 434 (1971), as having effectively overruled our prior decisions that the property owner's innocence has no constitutional significance for purposes of forfeiture, the District Court further declared that the Puerto Rican statutes, insofar as applied to forfeit appellee's interest in the yacht, unconstitutionally deprived it of property without just compensation. 363 F.Supp., at 1341\u20141342. Appellants were accordingly enjoined from enforcing the statutes 'insofar as they deny the owner or person in charge of property an opportunity for a hearing due to the lack of notice, before the seizure and forfeiture of its property and insofar as a penalty is imposed upon innocent parties.' Id., at 1343\u20141344. We noted probable jurisdiction. 414 U.S. 816, 94 S.Ct. 69, 38 L.Ed.2d 48 (1973). We reverse.\n\n\n5\n* Although the parties consented to the convening of the three-judge court and hence do not challenge our jurisdiction to decide this direct appeal, we nevertheless may not entertain the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 12537 unless statutes of Puerto Rico are 'State statute(s)' for purposes of the Three-Judge Court Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281.8 We therefore turn first to that question.\n\n\n6\nIn Stainback v. Mo Hock Ke Lok Po, 336 U.S. 368, 69 S.Ct. 606, 93 L.Ed. 741 (1949), this Court held that enactments of the Territory of Hawaii were not 'State statute(s)' for purposes of Judicial Code \u00a7 266, the predecessor to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281, reasoning:\n\n\n7\n'While, of course, great respect is to be paid to the      enactments of a territorial legislature by all courts as it      is to the adjudications of territorial courts, the      predominant reason for the enactment of Judicial Code \u00a7 266      does not exist ad respects territories. This reason was a      congressional purpose to avoid unnecessary interference with      the laws of a sovereign state. In our dual system of      government, the position of the state as sovereign over      matters not ruled by the Constitution requires a deference to      state legislative action beyond that required for the laws of a      territory. A territory is subject to congressional      regulation.' 336 U.S., at 377\u2014378, 69 S.Ct., at 611      (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).\n\n\n8\nSimilar reasoning\u2014that the purpose of insulating a sovereign State's laws from interference by a single judge would not be furthered by broadly interpreting the word 'State'\u2014led the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit some 55 years ago to hold \u00a7 266 inapplicable to the laws of the Territory of Puerto Rico. Benedicto v. West India & Panama Tel. Co., 256 F. 417 (1919).\n\n\n9\nCongress, however, created the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico after Benedicto was decided. Following the Spanish-American War, Puerto Rico was ceded to this country in the Treaty of Spain, 30 Stat. 1754 (1889). A brief interlude of military control was followed by congressional enactment of a series of Organic Acts for the government of the island. Initially these enactments established a local governmental structure with high officials appointed by the President. These Acts also retained veto power in the President and Congress over local legislation. By 1950, however, pressures for greater autonomy led to congressional enactment of Pub.L. 600, 64 Stat. 319, which offered the people of Puerto Rico a compact whereby they might establish a government under their own constitution. Puerto Rico accepted the compact, and on July 3, 1952, Congress approved, with minor amendments, a constitution adopted by the Puerto Rican populace, 66 Stat. 327; see note accompanying 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 731d. Pursuant to that constitution the Commonwealth now 'elects its Governor and legislature; appoints its judges, all cabinet officials, and lesser officials in the executive branch; sets its own educational policies; determines its own budget; and amends its own civil and criminal code.' Leibowitz, The applicability of Federal Law to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 56 Geo.L.J. 219, 221 (1967); see 28 Dept. of State Bull. 584\u2014589 (1953); Americana of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Kaplus, 368 F.2d 431 (CA3 1966); Magruder, The Commonwealth Status of Puerto Rico, 15 U.Pitt.L.Rev. 1 (1953).\n\n\n10\nThese significant changes in Puerto Rico's governmental structure formed the backdrop to Judge Magruder's observations in Mora v. Mejias, 206 F.2d 377 (CA1 1953):\n\n\n11\n'(I)t may be that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\u2014'El Estado      Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico' in the Spanish version      organized as a body politic by the people of Puerto Rico      under their own constitution, pursuant to the terms of the      compact offered to them in Pub.L. 600, and by them accepted,      is a State within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281. The      preamble to this constitution refers to the Commonwealth. . .      which 'in the exercise of our natural rights, we (the people      of Puerto Rico) now create within our union with the United      States of America.' Puerto Rico has thus not become a State      in the federal Union like the 48 States, but it would seem to      have become a State within a common and accepted meaning of      the word. Cf. State of Texas v. White, 1868, 7 Wall. 700,      721, 74 U.S. 700, 19 L.Ed. 227. . . . It is a political      entity created by the act and with the consent of the people      of Puerto Rico and joined in union with the United States of      America under the terms of the compact.\n\n\n12\n'A serious argument could therefore be made that the      Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is a State within the intendment      and policy of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281. . . . If the constitution of      the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is really a 'constitution'\u2014as      the Congress says it is, 66 Stat. 327,\u2014and not just another      Organic Act approved and enacted by the Congress, then the question      is whether the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is to be deemed      'sovereign over matters not ruled by the Constitution' of the      United States and thus a 'State' within the policy of 28      U.S.C. \u00a7 2281, which enactment, in prescribing a three-judge      federal district court, expresses 'a deference to state      legislative action beyond that required for the laws of a      territory' (Stainback v. Mo Hock Ke Lok Po, 336 U.S., at 378,      69 S.Ct., at 611\u2014612.) whose local affairs are subject to      congressional regulation.' 206 F.2d, at 387\u2014388 (footnote      omitted).\n\n\n13\nLower federal courts since 1953 have adopted this anaylsis and concluded that Puerto Rico is to be deemed 'sovereign over matters not ruled by the Constitution' and thus a State within the policy of the Three-Judge Court Act. See Mora v. Mejias, D.C., 115 F.Supp. 610 (PR 1953);9 Marin v. University of Puerto Rico, D.C., 346 F.Supp. 470, 481 (PR 1972); Suarez v. Administrator del Deporte Hipico de Puerto Rico, D.C., 354 F.Supp. 320 (PR 1972). And in Wackenhut Corp. v. Aponte, 386 U.S. 268, 87 S.Ct. 1017, 18 L.Ed.2d 37 (1967), we summarily affirmed the decision of a three-judge court for the District of Puerto Rico that had ordered abstention and said:\n\n\n14\n'(A)pplication of the doctrine of abstention is particularly      appropriate in a case . . . involv(ing) the construction and      validity of a statute of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. For      a due regard for the status of that Commonwealth under its      compact with the Congress of the United States dictates, we      believe, that it should have the primary opportunity through      its courts to determine the intended scope of its own      legislation and to pass upon the validity of that legislation      under its own constitution as well as under the Constitution      of the United States.' 266 F.Supp. 401, 405 (1966).\n\n\n15\nAlthough the question of Puerto Rico's status under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2881 was raised in neither the Jurisdictional Statement nor the Motion to Affirm in Wackenhut, and we do not normally feel ourselves bound by a sub silentio exercise of jurisdiction, see Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 535 n. 5, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 1377, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974); United States v. More, 3 Cranch 159, 172, 2 L.Ed. 397 (1805), this Court has noted that in three-judge court cases, 'where . . . the responsibility (is) on the courts to see that the three-judge rule (is) followed,' unexplained action may take on added significance. Stainback v. Mo Hock Ke Lok Po, 336 U.S., at 379\u2014380, 69 S.Ct., at 612\u2014613. This is particularly so, when as in Wackenhut, the opinion supporting the judgment over which we exercised appellate jurisdiction had expressed the view that abstention was appropriate for reasons of comity, an oft-repeated justification for the abstention doctrine, see, e.g., Railroad Comm'n of Texas v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 500, 61 S.Ct. 643, 645, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941),10 as well as the principal underpinning of the Three-Judge Court Act. See Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 465\u2014466, 94 S.Ct. 1209, 39 L.Ed.2d 505 (1974).\n\n\n16\nWhile still of the view that \u00a7 2281 is not 'a measure of broad social policy to be construed with great liberality,' Phillips v. United States, 312 U.S. 246, 251, 61 S.Ct. 480, 483, 85 L.Ed. 800 (1941), we believe that the established federal judicial practice of treating enactments of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as 'State statute(s)' for purposes of the Three-Judge Court Act, serves, and does not expand, the purposes of \u00a7 2281. We therefore hold that a three-judge court was properly convened under that statute,11 and that direct appeal to this Court was proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253. Accordingly, we now turn to the merits.\n\nII\n\n17\nAppellants challenge the District Court's holding that the appellee was denied due process of law by the omission from \u00a7 2512(b), as it incorporates \u00a7 1722, of provisions for preseizure notice and hearing. They argue that seizure for purposes of forfeiture is one of those \"extraordinary situations' that justify postponing notice and opportunity for a hearing.' Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S., at 90, 92 S.Ct., at 1999; see Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., 395 U.S. 337, 339, 89 S.Ct. 1820, 1821, 23 L.Ed.2d 349 (1969); Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 378\u2014379, 91 S.Ct. 780, 786\u2014787, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971). We agree.12\n\n\n18\nIn holding that lack of preseizure notice and hearing denied due process, the District Court relied primarily upon our decision in Fuentes v. Shevin, supra. Fuentes involved the validity of Florida and Pennsylvania replevin statutes permitting creditors to seize goods allegedly wrongfully detained. A writ of replevin could be obtained under the Florida statute upon the creditor's bare assertion to a court clerk that he was entitled to the property, and under the Pennsylvania statute, upon filing an affidavit fixing the value of the property, without alleging legal entitlement to the property. Fuentes held that the statutory procedures deprived debtors of their property without due process by failing to provide for hearings \"at a meaningful time.\" 407 U.S., at 80, 92 S.Ct., at 1994.\n\n\n19\nFuentes reaffirmed, however, that, in limited circumstances, immediate seizure of a property interest, without an opportunity for prior hearing, is constitutionally permissible. Such circumstances are those in which\n\n\n20\n'the seizure has been directly necessary to secure an      important governmental or general public interest. Second,      there has been a special need for very prompt action. Third,      the State has kept strict control over its monopoly of      legitimate force: the person initiating the seizure has been      a government official responsible for determining, under the      standards of a narrowly drawn statute, that it was necessary      and justified in the particular instance.' Id., at 91, 92      S.Ct., at 2000.\n\n\n21\nThus, for example, due process is not denied when postponement of notice and hearing is necessary to protect the public from contaminated food, North American cold Storage Co. v. Chicago, 211 U.S. 306, 29 S.Ct. 101, 53 L.Ed. 195 (1908); from a bank failure, Coffin Bros. & Co. v. Bennett, 277 U.S. 29, 48 S.Ct. 422, 72 L.Ed. 768 (1928); or from misbranded drugs, Ewing v. Mytinger & Casselberry, Inc., 339 U.S. 594, 70 S.Ct. 870, 94 L.Ed. 1088 (1950); or to aid the collection of taxes, Phillips v. Commissioner, 283 U.S. 589, 51 S.Ct. 608, 75 L.Ed. 1289 (1931); or the war effort, United States v. Pfitsch, 256 U.S. 547, 41 S.Ct. 569, 65 L.Ed. 1084 (1921).\n\n\n22\nThe considerations that justified postponement of notice and hearing in those cases are present here. First, seizure under the Puerto Rican statutes serves significant governmental purposes: Seizure permits Puerto Rico to assert in rem jurisdiction over the property in order to conduct forfeiture proceedings,13 thereby fostering the public interest in preventing continued illicit use of the property and in enforcing criminal sanctions. Second, preseizure notice and hearing might frustrate the interests served by the statutes, since the property seized\u2014as here, a yacht\u2014will often be of a sort that could be removed to another jurisdiction, destroyed, or concealed, if advance warning of confiscation were given. And finally, unlike the situation in Fuentes, seizure is not initiated by self-interested private parties; rather, Commonwealth officials determine whether seizure is appropriate under the provisions of the Puerto Rican statutes.14 In these circumstances, we hold that this case presents an 'extraordinary' situation in which postponement of notice and hearing until after seizure did not deny due process.15\n\nIII\n\n23\nAppellants next argue that the District Court erred in holding that the forfeiture statutes unconstitutionally authorized the taking for government use of innocent parties' property without just compensation. They urge that a long line of prior decisions of this Court establish the principle that statutory forfeiture schemes are not rendered unconstitutional because of their applicability to the property interests of innocents, and further that United States v. United States Coin & Currency, 401 U.S. 715, 91 S.Ct. 1041, 28 L.Ed.2d 434 (1971), did not\u2014contrary to the opinion of the District Court\u2014overrule those prior precedents sub silentio. We agree. The historical background of forfeiture statutes in this country and this Court's prior decisions sustaining their constitutionality lead to that conclusion.\n\n\n24\nAt common law the value of an inanimate object directly or indirectly causing the accidental death of a King's subject was forfeited to the Crown as a deodand.16 The origins of the deodand are traceable to Biblical17 and pre-Judeo-Christian practices, which reflected the view that the instrument of death was accused and that religious expiation was required. See O. Holmes, the Common Law, c. 1 (1881). The value of the instrument was forfeited to the King, in the belief that the King would provide the money for Masses to be said for the good of the dead man's soul, or insure that the deodand was put to charitable uses. 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *300.18 When application of the deodand to religious or eleemosynary purposes ceased, and the deodand became a source of Crown revenue, the institution was justified as a penalty for carelessness.19\n\n\n25\nForfeiture also resulted at common law from conviction for felonies and treason. The convicted felon forfeited his chattels to the Crown and his lands escheated to his lord; the convicted traitor forfeited all of his property, real and personal, to the Crown. See 3 W. Holdsworth, History of English Law 68\u201471 (3d ed. 1927); 1 F. Pollock & F. Maitland, History of English Law 351 (2d ed. 1909). The basis for these forfeitures was that a breach of the criminal law was an offense to the King's peace, which was felt to justify denial of the right to own property. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *299.20\n\n\n26\nIn addition, English Law provided for statutory forfeitures of offending objects used in violation of the customs and revenue laws\u2014likely a product of the confluence and merger of the deodand tradition and the belief that the right to own property could be denied the wrongdoer. Statutory forfeitures were most often enforced under the in rem procedure utilized in the Court of Exchequer to forfeit the property of felons. See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *261\u2014262; C. J. Hendry Co. v. Moore, 318 U.S. 133, 137\u2014138, 63 S.Ct. 499, 501\u2014502, 87 L.Ed. 663 (1943).\n\n\n27\nDeodands did not become part of the common-law tradition of this country. See Parker-Harris Co. v. Tate, 135 Tenn. 509, 188 S.W. 54 (1916). Nor has forfeiture of estates as a consequence of federal criminal conviction been permitted, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3563; Rev.Stat. \u00a7 5326 (1874); 1 Stat. 117 (1790). Forfeiture of estates resulting from a conviction for treason has been constitutionally proscribed by Art. III, \u00a7 3, though forfeitures of estates for the lifetime of a traitor have been sanctioned, see Wallach v. Van Riswick, 92 U.S. 202, 23 L.Ed. 473 (1876). But '(l)ong before the adoption of the Constitution the common law courts in the Colonies\u2014and later in the states during the period of Confederation\u2014were exercising jurisdiction in rem in the enforcement of (English and local) forfeiture statutes,' C. J. Hendry Co. v. Moore, supra, 318 U.S., at 139, 63 S.Ct., at 503, which provided for the forfeiture of commodities and vessels used in violations of customs and revenue laws. See id., at 145\u2014148, 63 S.Ct., at 505\u2014507; Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 623, 6 S.Ct. 524, 528, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886). And almost immediately after adoption of the Constitution, ships and cargoes involved in customs offenses were made subject to forfeiture under federal law,21 as were vessels used to deliver slaves to foreign countries,22 and somewhat later those used to deliver slaves to this country.23 The enactment of forfeiture statutes has not abated; contemporary federal and state forfeiture statutes reach virtually any type of property that might be used in the conduct of a criminal enterprise.\n\n\n28\nDespite this proliferation of forfeiture enactments, the innocence of the owner of property subject to forfeiture has almost uniformly been rejected as a defense. Thus, Mr. Justice Story observed in The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1, 6 L.Ed. 531 (1827), that a conviction for piracy was not a prerequisite to a proceeding to forfeit a ship allegedly engaged in piratical aggression in violation of a federal statute:\n\n\n29\n'It is well known, that at the common law, in many cases of      felonies, the party forfeited his goods and chattels to the      crown. The forfeiture did not, strictly speaking, attach in      rem; but it was a part, or at least a consequence, of the      judgment of conviction. .. . (T)he (Crown's right to the      goods and chattels) attached only by the conviction of the      offender. . . . But this doctrine never was applied to      seizures and forfeitures, created by statute, in rem,      cognizable on the revenue side of the Exchequer. The thing is      here primarily considered as the offender, or rather the      offence is attached primarily to the thing; and this, whether      the offence be malum prohibitum, or malum in se . . .. (T)he      practice has been, and so this Court understand the law to      be, that the proceeding in rem stands independent of, and      wholly unaffected by any criminal proceeding in personam.'      Id., at 14\u201415, 6 L.Ed. 531.\n\n\n30\nThis rationale was relied upon to sustain the statutory forfeiture of a vessel found to have been engaged in piratical conduct where the innocence of the owner was 'fully established.' United States v. Brig Malek Adhel, 2 How. 210, 238, 11 L.Ed. 239 (1844). The vessel was 'treated as the offender,' without regard to the owner's conduct, 'as the only adequate means of suppressing the offence or wrong, or insuring an indemnity to the injured party.' Id., at 233, 11 L.Ed. 239.24\n\n\n31\nDobbins's Distillery v. United States, 96 U.S. 395, 24 L.Ed. 637 (1878), is an illustration of how severely this principle has been applied. That case involved a lessee's violations of the revenue laws which led to the seizure of real and personal property used in connection with a distillery. The lessor's assertions of innocence were rejected as a defense to a federal statutory forfeiture of his entire property, for the offense 'attached primarily to the distillery, and the real and personal property used in connection with the same, without any regard whatsoever to the personal misconduct or responsibility of the owner, beyond what necessarily arises from the fact that he leased the property to the distiller, and suffered it to be occupied and used by the lessee as a distillery.' Id., at 401, 24 L.Ed. 637; see United States v. Stowell, 133 U.S. 1, 13\u201414, 10 S.Ct. 244, 246, 33 L.Ed. 555 (1890).\n\n\n32\nDecisions reaching the same conclusion have continued into this century. In Goldsmith-Grant Co. v. United States, 254 U.S. 505, 41 S.Ct. 189, 65 L.Ed. 376 (1921), it was held that the federal taxfraud forfeiture statute did not deprive an innocent owner of his property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. There, the claimant was a conditional vendor of a taxicab that had been used in the removal and concealment of distilled spirits upon which the federal tax was unpaid. Although recognizing that arguments against the application of the statute to cover an innocent owner were not without force, the Court rejected them, saying:\n\n\n33\n'In breaches of revenue provisions, some forms of property      are facilities, and therefore it may be said, that Congress      interposes the care and responsibility of their owners in aid of the prohibitions of the law and its      punitive provisions, by ascribing to the property a certain      personality, a power of complicity and guilt in the wrong. In      such case there is some analogy to the law of deodand by      which a personal chattel that was the immediate cause of the      death of any reasonable creature was forfeited. To the      superstitious reason to which the rule was ascribed,      Blackstone adds: 'That such misfortunes are in part owing to      the negligence of the owner, and therefore, he is properly      punishable by such forfeiture.' . . .\n\n\n34\n'But whether the reason for (the forfeiture) be artificial or      real, it is too firmly fixed in the punitive and remedial      jurisprudence of the country to be now displaced.' Id., at      510\u2014511, 41 S.Ct., at 191, 65 L.Ed. 376.\n\n\n35\nSee also United States v. One Ford Coupe Automobile, 272 U.S. 321, 47 S.Ct. 154, 71 L.Ed. 279 (1926) (Brandeis, J.); General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. United States, 286 U.S. 49, 52 S.Ct. 468, 76 L.Ed. 971 (1932) (Cardozo, J.). In Van Oster v. Kansas, 272 U.S. 465, 47 S.Ct. 133, 71 L.Ed. 354 (1926), the Court upheld , against a Fourteenth Amendment attack, a forfeiture under state law of an innocent owner's interest in an automobile that he had entrusted to an alleged wrongdoer. Judicial inquiry into the guilt or innocence of the owner could be dispensed with, the Court held, because state lawmakers, in the exercise of the police power, were free to determine that certain uses of property were undesirable and then establish 'a secondary defense against a forbidden use . . ..' Id., at 467, 47 S.Ct., at 134.\n\n\n36\nPlainly, the Puerto Rican forfeiture statutes further the punitive and deterrent purposes that have been found sufficient to uphold, against constitutional challenge, the application of other forfeiture statutes to the property of innocents.25 Forfeiture of conveyances that have been used\u2014and may be used again\u2014in violation of the narcotics laws fosters the purposes served by the underlying criminal statutes, both by preventing further illicit use of the conveyance and by imposing an economic penalty, thereby rendering illegal behavior unprofitable. See, e.g., H.R.Rep.No.1054, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. (1939); S.Rep.No.926, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. (1939); H.R.Rep.No.2751, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. (1950); S.Rep.No.1755, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. (1950).26 To the extent that such forfeiture provisions are applied to lessors, bailors, or secured creditors who are innocent of any wrongdoing, confiscation may have the desirable effect of inducing them to exercise greater care in transferring possession of their property. Cf. United States v. One 1936 Model Ford V\u20148 DeLuxe Coach, 307 U.S. 219, 238 241, 59 S.Ct. 861, 870\u2014871, 83 L.Ed. 1249 (1939) (Douglas, J., dissenting).\n\n\n37\nAgainst the legitimate governmental interests served by the Puerto Rican statute and the long line of this Court's decisions which squarely collide with appellee's assertion of a constitutional violation, the District Court opposed our decision in United States v. United States Coin & Currency, 401 U.S. 715, 91 S.Ct. 1041, 28 L.Ed.2d 434 (1971). This reliance was misplaced. In Coin & Currency, the Government claimed that the privilege against self-incrimination could not be asserted in a forfeiture proceeding under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7302 by one in possession of money seized from him when used in an illegal bookmaking operation. In the Government's view, the proceeding was not 'criminal' because the forfeiture was authorized without regard to the guilt or innocence of the owner of the money. The Court's answer was that \u00a7 7302, read in conjunction with 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1618, manifested a clear intention 'to impose a penalty only upon those who (were) significantly involved in a criminal enterprise,' 401 U.S., at 721 722, 91 S.Ct., at 1045, and in that circumstance the privilege could be asserted in the forfeiture proceeding by the person from whom the money was taken. Thus, Coin & Currency did not overrule prior decisions that sustained application to innocents of forfeiture statutes, like the Puerto Rican statutes, not limited in application to persons 'significantly involved in a criminal enterprise.'\n\n\n38\nThis is not to say, however, that the 'broad sweep' of forfeiture statutes remarked in Coin & Currency could not, in other circumstances, give rise to serious constitutional questions. Mr. Chief Justice Marshall intimated as much over a century and a half ago in observing that 'a forfeiture can only be applied to those cases in which the means that are prescribed for the prevention of a forfeiture may be employed.' Peisch v. Ware, 4 Cranch 347, 363, 2 L.Ed. 643 (1808). It therefore has been implied that it would be difficult to reject the constitutional claim of an owner whose property subjected to forfeiture had been taken from him without his privity or consent. See id., at 364, 2 L.Ed. 643; Goldsmith-Grant Co. v. United States, 254 U.S., at 512, 41 S.Ct., at 191; United States v. One Ford Coupe Automobile, 272 U.S., at 333, 47 S.Ct., at 158; van Oster v. Kansas, 272 U.S., at 467, 47 S.Ct., at 134. Similarly, the same might be said of an owner who proved not only that he was uninvolved in and unaware of the wrongful activity, but also that he had done all that reasonably could be expected to prevent the proscribed use of his property;27 for, in that circumstance, it would be difficult to conclude that forfeiture served legitimate purposes and was not unduly oppressive. Cf. Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49, 80 S.Ct. 1563, 1569, 4 L.Ed.2d 1554 (1960).\n\n\n39\nBut in this case appellee voluntarily entrusted the lesses with possession of the yacht, and no allegation has been made or proof offered that the company did all that it reasonably could to avoid having its property put to an unlawful use. Cf. Goldblatt v. Town of Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590, 596, 82 S.Ct. 987, 991, 8 L.Ed.2d 130 (1962). The judgment of the District Court is reversed.\n\n\n40\nReversed.\n\n\n41\nMr. Justice STEWART joins Parts I and II of the Court's opinion, but, for the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, he would hold that the forfeiture of property belonging to an innocent and nonnegligent owner violates the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n\n42\nMr. Justice WHITE, with whom Mr. Justice POWELL joins, concurring.\n\n\n43\nI join the Court's opinion, and agree that there was no constitutional necessity under Fuentas v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972), or any other case in this Court to accord the owner-lessor of the yacht a hearing in the circumstances of this case. I add, however, that the presence of important public interests which permits dispensing with a preseizure hearing in the instant case, is only one of the situations in which no prior hearing is required. See Mitchell v. Grant, 416 U.S. 600, 94 S.Ct. 1895, 40 L.Ed.2d 406; Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (White J., concurring).\n\n\n44\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting in part.\n\n\n45\nWhile I agree that Puerto Rico is a State for purposes of the three-judge court jurisdiction, I dissent on the merits.\n\n\n46\nThe discovery of marihuana on the yacht took place May 6, 1972. The seizure of the yacht took place on July 11, 1972\u2014over two months later. In view of the long delay in making the seizure where is that 'special need for very prompt action' which we emphasized in Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 91, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 2000, 32 L.Ed.2d 556? The Court cites instances of exigent circumstance\u2014seized poisoned food, dangerous drugs, failure of a bank, and the like. But they are inapt.\n\n\n47\nFuentes v. Shevin, involved a contest between debtor and creditor and a resolution of private property rights not implicated in an important governmental purpose. Here important governmental purposes are involved. As to that type of case we said in Fuentes: 'First, in each case, the seizure has been directly necessary to secure an important governmental or general public interest. Second, there has been a special need for very prompt action. Third, the State has kept strict control over its monopoly of legitimate force: the person initiating the seizure has been a government official responsible for determining, under the standards of a narrowly drawn statute, that it was necessary and justified in the particular instance. Thus, the Court has allowed summary seizure of property to collect the internal revenue of the United States, to meet the needs of a national war effort, to protect against the economic disaster of a bank failure, and to protect the public from misbranded drugs and contaminated food.' Id., at 91\u201492, 92 S.Ct., at 2000.\n\n\n48\nPostponement of notice and hearing until after seizure of the vessel apparently was not needed here, as the District Court held. Yet after that two-month delay, forfeiture of the vessel is ordered without notice to the owner and without just compensation for the taking. On those premises this is the classic case of lack of procedural due process.\n\n\n49\nThe owner on the record before us was wholly innocent of knowing that the lessee was using the vessel illegally. To analogize this case to the old cases of forfeiture of property of felons is peculiarly inappropriate. Nor is this a case where owner and lessee are 'in cahoots' in a smuggling venture or negligent in any way. The law does provide for forfeitures of property even of the innocent. But as Mr. Chief Justice Marshall said in Peisch v. Ware, 4 Cranch 347, 365, 2 L.Ed. 643: '(T)he law is not understood to forfeit the property of owners or consignees, on account of the misconduct of mere strangers, over whom such owners or consignees could have no control.'\n\n\n50\nThe lessee of the vessel was, of course, no stranger. Here unlike United States v. One 1936 Model Ford V\u20148 DeLuxe Coach, 307 U.S. 219, 238\u2014239, 59 S.Ct. 861, 870\u2014871, 83 L.Ed. 1249 (Douglas, J., dissenting), there is no suggestion that the lessee was a mere strawman for runners of drugs. Even where such ambiguous circumstances were present the Court refused to impose forfeiture of an auto running illegal whiskey and belonging to those who acted 'in good faith and without negligence.' Id., at 236, 59 S.Ct., at 870.\n\n\n51\nThe present case is one of extreme hardship. The District Court found that the owner 'did not know that its property was being used for an illegal purpose and was completely innocent of the lessee's criminal act. After the seizure and within the time allowed by law, the Superintendent (of the Police) notified lessee. Plaintiff was never notified and, since lessee did not post bond, the yacht was forfeited to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. It was not until plaintiff attempted to recover possession of the yacht after lessee had defaulted in the rental payments that plaintiff learned of its forfeiture.' 363 F.Supp. 1337, 1340. Moreover, the owner had included in the lease a prohibition against use of the yacht for an unlawful project.\n\n\n52\nIf the yacht had been notoriously used in smuggling drugs, those who claim forfeiture might have equity on their side. But no such showing was made; and so far as we know only one marihuana cigarette was found on the yacht. We deal here with trivia where harsh judge-made law should be tempered with justice. I realize that the ancient law is founded on the fiction that the inanimate object itself is guilty of wrongdoing. United States v. United States Coin & Currency, 401 U.S. 715, 719\u2014720, 91 S.Ct. 1041, 1043 1044, 28 L.Ed.2d 434. But that traditional forfeiture doctrine cannot at times be reconciled with the requirements of the Fifth Amendment. Id., at 721, 91 S.Ct., at 1044. Such a case is the present one.\n\n\n53\nSome forfeiture statutes are mandatory, title vesting in the State when the forfeiting act occurs. United States v. Stowell, 133 U.S. 1, 19, 10 S.Ct. 244, 248, 33 L.Ed. 555. Others are conditional, forfeiture occurring only if and when the State follows prescribed procedures. One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, 380 U.S. 693, 699, 85 S.Ct. 1246, 1250, 14 L.Ed.2d 170. Some forfeiture statutes exclude from their scope, property used in violation of the law as to which the owner is not 'a consenting party or privy.' See 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1594. Some provide for discretionary administrative or judicial relief from forfeiture if the forfeiture was incurred without willful negligence or without any intention on the part of the owner to violate the law, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1618, or if the owner had at no time any knowledge or reason to believe that the property was used in violation of specified laws, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3617(b); United States v. One 1936 Model Ford V\u20148 DeLuxe Coach, 307 U.S. 219, 59 S.Ct. 861, 83 L.Ed. 1249.\n\n\n54\nPuerto Rico, however, has no provision for mitigation in case the owner of the seized property is wholly innocent of any wrongdoing. And, as the Court says, these absolute, mandatory forfeiture procedures have been supported at least by much dicta in the cases.\n\n\n55\nBut in my view, there was a taking of private property 'for public use' under the Fifth Amendment, applied to the States by the Fourteenth, and compensation must be paid an innocent owner. Where the owner is in no way implicated in the illegal project, I see no way to avoid paying just compensation for property taken. I, therefore, would remand the case to the three-judge court for findings as to the innocence of the lessor of the yacht\u2014whether the illegal use was of such magnitude or notoriety that the owner cannot be found faultless in remaining ignorant of its occurrence.\n\n\n56\nThe law of deodands* was at one time as severe as the rule applied this day by the Court. See Law of Deodands, 34 Law Mag. 188\u2014191 (1845). Its severity was tempered by juries who were sustained by the King's Bench, id., at 191. The 'greater moderation' of the jurors in light of 'the moral innocence of the party incurring the penalty,' id., at 190, is an example we should follow here. While the law of deodands does not obtain here (cf. J. W. Goldsmith-Grant Co. v. United States, 254 U.S. 505, 510\u2014511, 41 S.Ct. 189, 190\u2014191, 65 L.Ed. 376; United States v. One Ford Coupe, 272 U.S. 321, 333, 47 S.Ct. 154, 158, 71 L.Ed. 279), the quality of mercy is no stranger to our equity jurisdiction, Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329\u2014330, 64 S.Ct. 587, 591\u2014592, 88 L.Ed. 754; United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95, 5 L.Ed. 37.\n\n\n\n1\n Title 24, \u00a7\u00a7 2512(a)(4) and (b) provide:\n'(a) The following shall be subject to forfeiture to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico:\n'(4) All conveyances, including aircraft, vehicles, mount or vessels, which are used, or are intended for use, to transport, or in any manner to facilitate the transportation, sale, receipt, possession, or concealment of property described in clauses (1) and (2) of this subsection;\n'(b) Any property subject to forfeiture under clause (4) of subsection (a) of this section shall be seized by process issued pursuant to Act No. 39, of June 4, 1960, as amended, known as the Uniform Vehicle, Mount, Vessel and Plane Seizure Act, sections 1721 and 1722 of Title 34.'\n\n\n2\n Title 34, \u00a7 1722, provides:\n'Whenever any vehicle, mount, or other vessel or plane is seized . . . such seizure shall be conducted as follows:\n'(a) The proceedings shall be begun by the seizure of the property by the Secretary of Justice, the Secretary of the Treasury or the Police Superintendent, through their delegates, policemen or other peace officers. The officer under whose authority the action is taken shall serve notice on the owner of the property seized or the person in charge thereof or any person having any known right or interest therein, of the seizure and of the appraisal of the properties so seized, said notice to be served in an authentic manner, within ten (10) days following such seizure and such notice shall be understood to have been served upon the mailing thereof with return receipt requested. The owners, persons in charge, and\nother persons having a known interest in the property so seized may challenge the confiscation within the fifteen (15) days following the service of the notice on them, through a complaint against the officer under whose authority the confiscation has been made, on whom notice shall be served, and which complaint shall be filed in the Part of the Superior Court corresponding to the place where the seizure was made and shall be heard without subjection to docket. All questions that may arise shall be decided and all other proceedings shall be conducted as in an ordinary civil action. Against the judgment entered no remedy shall lie other than a certiorari before the Supreme Court, limited to issues of law. The filing of such complaint within the period herein established shall be considered a jurisdictional prerequisite for the availing of the action herein authorized.\n'(b) Every vehicle, mount, or any vessel or plane so seized shall be appraised as soon as taken possession of by the officer under whose authority the seizure took place, or by his delegate, with the exception of motor vehicles, which shall be placed under the custody of the Office of Transportation of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which shall appraise same immediately upon receipt thereof.\n'In the event of a judicial challenge of the seizure, the court shall, upon request of the plaintiff and after hearing the parties, determine the reasonableness of the appraisal as an incident of the challenge.\n'Within ten (10) days after the filing of the challenge, the plaintiff shall have the right to give bond in favor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico before the pertinent court's clerk to the satisfaction of the court, for the amount of the assessed value of the seized property, which bond may be in legal tender, by certified check, hypothecary debentures, or by insurance companies. Upon the acceptance of the bond, the court shall direct that the property be returned to the owner thereof. In such case, the provisions of the following paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) shall not apply.\n'When bond is accepted the subsequent substitution of the seized property in lieu of the bond shall not be permitted, said bond to answer for the seizure if the lawfulness of the latter is upheld, and the court shall provide in the resolution issued to that effect, for\nthe summary forfeiture execution of said bond by the clerk of the court and for the covering of such bond into the general funds of the Government of Puerto Rico in case it may be in legal tender or by certified check; the hypothecary debentures or debentures of insurance companies shall be transmitted by the pertinent clerk of the court to the Secretary of Justice for execution.\n'(c) After fifteen (15) days have elapsed since service of notice of the seizure without the person or persons with interest in the property seized have (sic) filed the corresponding challenge, or after twenty-five (25) days have elapsed since service of notice of the seizure without the court's having directed that the seized property be returned on account of the bond to that effect having been given, the officer under whose authority the seizure took place, the delegate thereof, or the Office of Transportation, as the case may be, may provide for the sale at auction of the seized property, or may set the same aside for official use of the Government of Puerto Rico. In case the seized property cannot be sold at auction or set aside for official use of the Government, the property may be destroyed by the officer in charge, setting forth in a minute which he shall draw up for the purpose, the description of the property, the reasons for its destruction and the date and place where it is destroyed, and he shall serve notice with a copy thereof on the Secretary of Justice.\n'(d) In case the vehicle, mount, or vessel or plane is sold at auction, the proceeds from the sale shall be covered into the general fund of the Government of Puerto Rico, after deducting and reimbursing expenses incurred.\n'(e) If the seizure is judicially challenged and the court declares same illegal, the Secretary of the Treasury of Puerto Rico shall, upon presentation of a certified copy of the final decision or judgment of the court, pay to the challenger the amount of the appraisal or the proceeds from the public auction sale of such property, whichever sum is the highest, plus interest thereon at the rate of 6% per annum, counting from the date of the seizure.'\n\n\n3\n P.R.Laws Ann., Tit. 23, \u00a7\u00a7 451(e), 451b, and 451c, provide that no person shall 'operate or give permission for the operation of' a vessel in Commonwealth waters without registering his interest in the vessel. Only the lessees had registered the yacht, and this led the District Court to conclude that '(f)rom the record in this case, we are not disposed to rule that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico did not have reason to believe that (postseizure) notice to the owner was, in fact, given.' 363 F.Supp. 1337, 1342 (PR 1973). Appellee does not contest this ruling.\n\n\n4\n It is agreed that the yacht was appraised at a value of $19,800, and that the Chief of the Office of Transportation of the Commonwealth purports to maintain possession of the yacht as legal owner.\n\n\n5\n Unconstitutionality of the statutes was alleged under both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court deemed it unnecessary to determine which Amendment applied to Puerto Rico, see Fornaris v. Ridge Tool Co., 400 U.S. 41, 43\u201444, 91 S.Ct. 156, 157\u2014158, 27 L.Ed.2d 174 (1970), and we agree. The Joint Resolution of Congress approving the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, subjects its government to 'the applicable provisions of the Constitution of the United States,' 66 Stat. 327, and 'there cannot exist under the American flag any governmental authority untrammeled by the requirements of due process of law as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.' Mora v. Mejias, 206 F.2d 377, 382 (CA1 1953) (Magruder, C.J.). See 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 737.\n\n\n6\n Appellants initially opposed the convening of a three-judge court, arguing that the District Court should abstain. After a hearing, appellants withdrew their opposition and consented to the convening of a three-judge court.\n\n\n7\n That section provides:\n'Except as otherwise provided by law, any party may appeal to the Supreme Court from an order granting or denying, after notice and hearing, an interlocutory or permanent injunction in any cvil action, suit or proceeding required by any Act of Congress to be heard and determined by a district court of three judges.' (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n8\n That section provides:\n'An interlocutory or permanent injunction restraining the enforcement, operation or execution of any State statute by restraining the action of any officer of such State in the enforcement or execution of such statute or of an order made by an administrative board or commission acting under State statutes, shall not be granted by any district court or judge thereof upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute unless the application therefor is heard and determined by a district court of three judges under section 2284 of this tile.' (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n9\n The court in Mora quoted from the statement of the United States to the Secretary General of the United Nations explaining its decision to cease transmission of information concerning Puerto Rico under Art. 73(e) of the United Nations Charter, which requires the communication of certain technical information by countries responsible for administering territories whose people have not yet attained a full measure of self-government, 115 F.Supp., at 612: \"By the various actions taken by the Congress and the people of Puerto Rico, Congress has agreed that Puerto Rico shall have, under that Constitution, freedom from control or interference by the Congress in respect of internal government and administration, subject only to compliance with applicable provisions of the Federal Constitution, the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act and the acts of Congress authorizing and approving the Constitution, as may be interpreted by Judicial decision. Those laws which directed or authorized interference with matters of local government by the Federal Government have been repealed.\"\n28 Dept. of State Bull. 584, 587 (1953). But cf. Note, Puerto Rico; Colony or Commonwealth? 6 N.Y.U.J.Int'l L. & P. 115 (1973).\n\n\n10\n See also H. Friendly, Federal Jurisdiction: A General View 93 (1973).\n\n\n11\n Fornaris v. Ridge Tool Co., 400 U.S. 41, 91 S.Ct. 156, 27 L.Ed.2d 174 (1970), does not militate against this holding. There, we held that a Puerto Rican statute was not a 'State statute' within 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(2), which permits appeals from judgments of federal courts of appeals holding state statutes unconstitutional. We noted that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1258, requiring that we permit final judgments of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to be reviewed by appeal or by certiorari, directly corresponded to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257 providing for review of final judgments of 'state' courts. Since no parallel provision was added to \u00a7 1254(2) to permit appeals from the courts of appeals holding Puerto Rican statutes unconstitutional, we said:\n'Whether the omission was by accident or by design, our practice of strict construction of statutes authorizing appeals dictates that we not give an expansive interpretation to the word 'State.\" 400 U.S., at 42 n. 1, 91 S.Ct., at 157.\nThis conclusion seems compelled by the history of the close relationship between 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(2) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257. In the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 85\u201486, final decisions of state courts sustaining state statutes against challenges under the Federal Constitution were subjected to review by this Court on writ of error. See King Mfg. Co. v. City Council of Augusta, 277 U.S. 100, 48 S.Ct. 489, 72 L.Ed. 801 (1928). But prior to 1925, there was no appeal from 'final' judgments of the federal circuit courts. See 36 Stat. 1157 (1911). When\nconsideration was being given to amendment of the Judiciary Act in 1924 and 1925\n'(a)ttention was drawn to the disparity between the want of obligatory review over (decisions of the circuit courts involving the constitutionality of state statutes) and the existence of obligatory jurisdiction over a similar class of cases in the state courts. Senator Copeland rehearsed before the Senate correspondence he had had on this point with the Chief Justice, who had urged that if it was desirable to put the circuit courts of appeals on the same level with the state courts, it would be better to withdraw review as of right from the state courts and subject the decisions of both the state courts and the circuit courts solely to a discretionary review by the Supreme Court, rather than to allow obligatory review over all constitutional cases from both courts. The Chief Justice, however, justified the proposed discrimination on the ground that a circuit court appeals in deciding a federal constitutional question 'would be more likely to preserve the Federal view of the issue than the State court, at least to an extent to justify making a review of its decision by our court conditional upon our approval.' However, an amendment prevailed which met this discrimination by allowing writ of error to the circuit courts of appeals in cases sustaining a constitutional claim against a state statute. The argument advanced by the Chief Justice thus became the basis for a new development of the principle which since 1789 had been the basis of Supreme Court review of the highest courts of the states. Due to the belief that the state courts would be more jealous of local rights than of federal claims, review had lain as of right where the constitutional claim was advanced and denied. Now, due to the belief . . . that the federal court would sustain constitutional claims as opposed to the local right, review was provided from the circuit courts of appeals where the constitutional claim was advanced and allowed. Thereby, the Senate 'intended to put the two on a perfect parity, allowing a writ of error from the circuit court of appeals under\nconditions exactly the same, except reversed, and allowing a writ of certiorari in the one case as in the other case, so that the two would be entirely harmonious.\" F. Frankfurther & J. Landis, The Business of the Supreme Court 277\u2014278 (1928) (footnotes omitted).\nThus, against that background, when Congress made \u00a7 1258 only a counterpart of \u00a7 1257, there could be no basis for an expansive reading of the word 'State' in \u00a7 1254(2), in the absence of its congressional amendment.\nWe have no occasion to address the question whether Puerto Rico is a 'State' for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343, a jurisdictional basis of appellee's complaint. Since the complaint and lease agreement, as incorporated, fairly read, leave little doubt that the matter in controversy exceeds $10,000 and arises under the Constitution of the United States, there is jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.\n\n\n12\n Appellants also argue that the seizure did not result in any injury to appellee that constituted failure of preseizure notice and hearing a denial of due process. This is so, they contend, because the lease gave the lessees exclusive right to possession at the time of the seizure, and therefore appellee's nonpossessory interest was adequately protected by the statutory provisions for a postseizure hearing. But the lease provides that lessees' failure, inter alia, within 15 days after notice from appellee to pay arrears of rent or use the yacht solely for legal purposes would establish a default entitling appellee to possession. Whether a default had in fact occurred between May 6, 1972, when a lessee was first accused of a narcotics violation, and the date of seizure, July 11, 1972, is not clear from the record, although it is clear that appellee did not attempt to repossess the yacht until October 19, 1972.\nSince, however, our holding is that preseizure notice and hearing are not required by due process in the context of this forfeiture,\nwe have no occasion to remand for a determination (1) whether the company had an immediate, but as yet unexercised, right to possession on the date of seizure or merely a right to collect rents, together with a reversionary interest, and (2) whether either or both of these property interests would be of sufficient significance to require that the company be given an advance opportunity to contest the seizure. Cf. Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 86\u201487, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 1997\u20141998, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972).\n\n\n13\n Cf. Ownbey v. Morgan, 256 U.S. 94, 41 S.Ct. 433, 65 L.Ed. 837 (1921), cited with approval in Fuentes v. Shevin, supra, 407 U.S., at 91 n. 23, 92 S.Ct., at 1999.\n\n\n14\n Fuentes expressly distinguished seizure under a search warrant from seizure under a writ of replevin:\n'First, a search warrant is generally issued to serve a highly important governmental need\u2014e.g., the apprehension and conviction of criminals\u2014rather than the mere private advantage of a private party in an economic transaction. Second, a search warrant is\ngenerally issued in situations demanding prompt action. The danger is all too obvious that a criminal will destroy or hide evidence or fruits of his crime if given any prior notice. Third, the Fourth Amendment guarantees that the State will not issue search warrants merely upon the conclusory application of a private party. It guarantees that the State will not abdicate control over the issuance of warrants and that no warrant will be issued without a prior showing of probable cause.' 407 U.S., at 93\u201494, n. 30, 92 S.Ct., at 2001.\nWe have no occasion to address the question whether the Fourth Amendment warrant or probable-cause requirements are applicable to seizures under the Puerto Rican statutes.\n\n\n15\n No challenge is made to the District Court's determination that the form of postseizure notice satisfied due process requirements. See n. 3, supra. Notice, of course, was required to be \"reasonably calculated' to apprise (the company) of the pendency of the forfeiture proceedings.' Robinson v. Hanrahan, 409 U.S. 38, 40, 93 S.Ct. 30, 31, 34 L.Ed.2d 47 (1972).\n\n\n16\n Deodand derives from the Latin Deo dandum, to be 'given to God.'\n\n\n17\n See Exodus 21:28 ('(i)f an ox gore a man or a woman, and they die, he shall be stoned and his flesh shall not be eaten').\n\n\n18\n See 1 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 419, 423\u2014424 (1st Am. ed. 1847); 2 F. Pollock & F. Maitland, History of English Law 473 (2d ed. 1909); Law of Deodands, 34 Law Mag. 188, 189 (1845); Finkelstein, The Goring Ox: Some Historical Perspectives on Deodands, Forfeitures, Wrongful Death and the Western Notion of Sovereignty, 46 Temp.L.Q. 169, 182 (1973).\n\n\n19\n See Hale, n. 18, supra, at 424. Indeed, the abolition of the deodand institution in England in 1846, 9 & 10 Vict. c. 62, went hand in hand with the passage of Lord Campbell's Act creating a cause of action for wrongful death, 9 & 10 Vict. c. 93 (1846). Passage of the two bills was linked, because Lord Campbell was unwilling to eliminate the deodand institution, with its tendency to deter carelessness, particularly by railroads, unless a right of action was granted to the dead man's survivors. See 77 Hansard's Parliamentary Debates, Third Series 1031 (1845). See generally Finkelstein, n. 18, supra, at 170\u2014171.\nThe adaptation of the deodand institution to serve the more contemporary function of deterrence is an example of a phenomenon discussed by Mr. Justice Holmes:\n'The customs, beliefs, or needs of a primitive time establish a rule or a formula. In the course of centuries the custom, belief, or necessity disappears, but the rule remains. The reason which gave rise to the rule has been forgotten, and ingenious minds set themselves to inquire how it is to be accounted for. Some ground of policy is thought of, which seems to explain it and to reconcile it with the present state of things; and then the rule adapts itself to the new reasons which have been found for it, and enters on a new career. The old form receives a new content, and in time even the form modifies itself to fit the meaning which it has received.' The Common Law 5 (1881).\n\n\n20\n In 1870, England eliminated most forfeitures of those convicted of felonies or treason. 33 & 34 Vict. c. 23.\n\n\n21\n Act of July 31, 1789, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 36, 1 Stat. 39, 47; see also Act of Aug. 4, 1790, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 22, 27, 28, 67, 1 Stat. 157, 161, 163, 176.\n\n\n22\n Act of Mar. 22, 1794, 1 Stat. 347.\n\n\n23\n Act of Mar. 2, 1807, 2 Stat. 426.\n\n\n24\n Thirty years earlier, the Court upheld a forfeiture of a quantity of coffee which had been transferred to bona fide purchasers after violation of the Non-Intercourse Act of 1809, upon reasoning that '(i)n the eternal struggle that exists between the avarice, enterprize and combinations of individuals on the one hand, and the power charged with the administration of the laws on the other, severe laws are rendered necessary to enable the executive to carry into effect the measure of policy adopted by the legislature.' United States v. 1960 Bags of Coffee, 8 Cranch 398, 405, 3 L.Ed. 602 (1814).\n\n\n25\n But for unimportant differences, P.R.Laws Ann., Tit. 24,\n\u00a7 2512(a) (Supp.1973) is modeled after 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a). The latter section provides:\n'(a) The following shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States and no property right shall exist in them:\n'(4) All conveyances, including aircraft, vehicles, or vessels, which are used, or are intended for use, to transport, or in any manner to facilitate the transportation, sale, receipt, possession, or concealment of property described in paragraph (1) or (2), except that\u2014\n'(A) no conveyance used by any person as a common carrier in the transaction of business as a common carrier shall be forfeited under the provisions of this section unless it shall appear that the owner or other person in charge of such conveyance was a consenting party or privy to a violation of this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter; and\n'(B) no conveyance shall be forfeited under the provisions of this section by reason of any act or omission established by the owner thereof to have been committed or omitted by any person other than such owner while such conveyance was unlawfully in the possession of a person other than the owner in violation of the criminal laws of the United States, or of any State. . . .'\nSee n. 1, supra. The exceptions contained in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of the federal statute, although having no specific counterpart in \u00a7 2512(a)(4), have been judicially recognized by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. See General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Branela, 61 P.R.R. 701 (1943); Metro Taxicabs, Inc. v. Treasurer of Puerto Rico, 73 P.R.R. 164 (1952); Commonwealth v. Superior Court, 94 P.R.R. 687 (1967).\n\n\n26\n Seizure and forfeiture statutes also help compensate the Government for its enforcement efforts and provide methods for obtaining security for subsequently imposed penalties and fines. See, e.g., One Lot Emperald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U.S. 232, 237, 93 S.Ct. 489, 493, 34 L.Ed.2d 438 (1972).\n\n\n27\n The common law sought to mitigate the harshness of felony and deodand forfeitures. The writ of restitution was available to an individual whose goods were stolen by a thief and forfeited to the crown as a consequence of the thief's conviction. See 2 F. Pollock & F. Maitland, supra, n. 18, at 165\u2014166; 3 W. Holdsworth, History of English Law 280 and n. 3 (3d ed. 1927). Mitigation with respect to deodands was less formalized: 'It seems also clear from the ancient authorities, that jurors always determined the amount of deodand to be imposed with great moderation, and with a due regard to the rights of property and the moral innocence of the party incurring the penalty. Our ancestors seem fully to have perceived the hardship of inflicting such penalty on one who had been guilty of no moral or indeed legal offence; and in all cases, therefore, where death was purely the result of accident, and not of negligence or carelessness, imposed, a nominal fine, or found that only to be the deodand which by its immediate contact occasioned death.' Law of Deodands, supra, n. 18, at 190.\nSince 1970 the Federal Government has applied the ameliorative policy\u2014first adopted in England, see United States v. Morris, 10 Wheat, 246, 293\u2014295, 6 L.Ed. 314 (1825)\u2014of providing administrative remissions and mitigations of statutory forfeitures in most cases where the violations are incurred 'without willful negligence' or an intent to commit the offense. See 1 Stat. 122, c. 12 (1790); 1 Stat. 506 (1797); Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 5292\u20145293 (1874); 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1618; The Laura, 114 U.S. 411, 414\u2014415 (1885); United States v. United States Coin & Currency, 401 U.S. 715, 721, 91 S.Ct. 1041, 1044, 28 L.Ed.2d 434 (1971). Indeed, forfeitures incurred under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a), which served as the model for enactment of the disputed Puerto Rican statute, see n. 25, supra, are subject to the remission and mitigation procedures of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1618. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(d). Regulations implementing \u00a7 1618 provide that, if the seized property was in the possession of another who was responsible for the act which resulted in the seizure, the petitioner must produce evidence explaining the manner in which the other person acquired possession and showing that, prior to parting with the property, he did not know or have reasonable cause to believe that the property would be used in violation of the law or that the violator had a criminal record or a reputation for commercial crime. 19 CFR \u00a7 171.13(a). These provisions are also extended to those individuals holding chattel mortgages or conditional sales contracts. 19 CFR \u00a7 171.13(b). See also 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3617(b), establishing standards for judicial remission and mitigation of forfeitures resulting from violations of the internal revenue laws relating to liquor.\n\n\n*\n The law of deodands starting with Exodus 21:28 is related by O. Holmes, The Common Law 7 et seq. (1881). Deodand derives from Deo dandum (to be given to God) 'It was to given to God, that is to say to the Church, for the king, to be expended for the good of his soul.' Id., at 24.\n\n\n","label":1}

The order also decreed that the School Board prepare and submit on or before November 1, 1969, a comprehensive plan for the complete desegregation of the entire school system. Intervenors of the 'McWilliams Class' appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit from the provision of the order which approved implementation of the School Board's proposed boundary changes by September 2, 1969, and sought a stay of that provision pending decision of the appeal. The Court of Appeals, on August 27, 1969, instead of limiting relief to the requested stay, summarily vacated the District Court's approval of the School Board's proposal. The Court of Appeals held that consideration of the proposal was inappropriate 'at this stage of the proceedings' and should await the District Court's 'consideration and adoption of a full and comprehensive plan for the complete desegregation and integration of the Oklahoma City School system as contemplated in the court's order of August 13, 1969.'\n\n\n2\nThe petition for certiorari is granted.1 The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the District Court's approval of the School Board's plan must be vacated because consideration of the proposal was inappropriate except in the context of a comprehensive city-wide plan. The burden on a school board is to desegregate an unconstitutional dual system at once. Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 439, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 1694\u20141695, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968); Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, 396 U.S. 19, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 41 (1969). Since the District Court ordered the desegregation measures into effect, and since the petitioners did not object to their scope, the Court of Appeals should have permitted their implementation pending argument and decision of the appeal. Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, supra. The order of the Court of Appeals is therefore vacated and the case is remanded to that court promptly to hear and determine, consistently with Alexander, all pending appeals from the District Court order.2\n\n\n3\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n4\nOrder of Court of Appeals vacated and case remanded.\n\n\n\n1\n The petition was filed pursuant to an expedited schedule specified by Mr. Justice Brennan when on petitioners' application he, as Acting Circuit Justice, vacated the order of the Court of Appeals and reinstated that of the District Court, pending action by this Court on the petition.\n\n\n2\n We are informed by the parties that the School Board on September 12, 1969, also filed on appeal from the District Court's approval of the Board's proposal, and another appeal from the District Court's denial on September 11, 1969, of the Board's application for amendment of the August 13 order to extend from November 1, 1969, to March 31, 1970, the time for filing of a comprehensive desegregation plan for secondary schools. The District Court granted the Board's application as to a plan for desegregation of the elementary schools.\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"446 U.S. 608\n100 S.Ct. 1905\n64 L.Ed.2d 548\nCecil D. ANDRUS, Secretary of the Interior, et  al., Petitioners,v.GLOVER CONSTRUCTION COMPANY.\nNo. 79-48.\nArgued March 24, 1980.\nDecided May 27, 1980.\n\n\nSyllabus\n\nHeld :  The Buy Indian Act, which permits the Secretary of the Interior to purchase \"the products of Indian industry  . . . in open market,\" does not authorize the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to enter into road construction contracts with Indian-owned companies without first advertising for bids pursuant to Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (FPASA).  There is no such authority even if the Buy Indian Act's language \"the products of Indian industry\" could be construed to embrace road construction, since, while negotiated procurements \"otherwise authorized by law\" are one of the specified exceptions to Title III's broad directive in 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 252(c) that all procurement by the covered executive agencies (including the BIA) proceed through advertising, such exception is omitted from the list of the exceptions specified in \u00a7 252(e) to the requirement that \u00a7 252(c) not be construed to permit any road construction contract to be negotiated without advertising.  From this omission only one inference can be drawn:  Congress meant to bar the negotiation of road construction projects under the authority of laws like the Buy Indian Act.  Pp. 612-619.\n591 F.2d 554, affirmed.\nAndrew J. Levander, Washington, D. C., pro hac vice, by special leave of Court, for petitioners.\nD. D. Hayes, Muskogee, Okl., for respondent.\nMr. Justice STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe Buy Indian Act, 35 Stat. 71, as amended, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 47, directs the Secretary of the Interior to employ Indian labor \"[s]o far as may be practicable,\" and permits him to purchase \"the products of Indian industry  . . .  in open market.\"1  The question presented in this case is whether the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) of the Department of the Interior2 may, on the authority of this legislation, enter into road construction contracts with Indian-owned companies without first advertising for bids pursuant to Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (FPASA), 63 Stat. 393, as amended, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 251-260.\n\n\n2\n* In 1976, the BIA formally adopted the procurement policy that \"all [BIA] purchases or contracts be made or entered into with qualified Indian contractors to the maximum practicable extent.\"3 To effectuate this objective, the BIA announced that in every procurement situation it would consider dealing with non-Indian contractors only after it had determined that there were \"no qualified Indian contractors within the normal competitive area that can fill or are interested in filling the procurement requirement.\"4\n\n\n3\nIn early 1977, the BIA invited three Indian-owned construction companies to submit bids for the repair and improvement of a 5-mile segment of road in Pushmataha County, Okla.  The road, commonly called the Honobia Road, is located within an area subject to BIA jurisdiction.  The respondent, a non-Indian corporation engaged as a general contractor in roadbuilding and other forms of heavy construction, was not afforded an opportunity to bid.5  On May 25, 1977, BIA awarded the contract to Indian Nations Construction Co., a corporation owned and controlled exclusively by Indians and the only Indian-owned company to have bid on the project.  The final negotiated contract price amounted to approximately $1.2 million.6\n\n\n4\nThe respondent then filed the present suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, naming as defendants the Secretary of the Interior, the Department of the Interior, BIA, and the BIA contracting officer on the Honobia Road project (petitioners here).  The respondent alleged that the petitioners were required by \u00a7 3709 of the Revised Statutes, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 5, and Title III of the FPASA to advertise publicly for bids on the Honobia Road project.  The respondent further claimed that the actions of the petitioners had denied it due process and equal protection in contravention of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  As relief, the respondent requested the District Court to set aside the Honobia Road contract and to enjoin the petitioners from engaging in the unadvertised negotiation of contracts on the purported authority of the Buy Indian Act.\n\n\n5\nAfter the completion of discovery, the District Court granted summary judgment to the respondent.  451 F.Supp. 1102.  The court concluded that the procedure followed by the petitioners in awarding the Honobia Road project to the Indian Nations Construction Co. violated the advertising requirements of the FPASA, in particular 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 252(e) and 253.  451 F.Supp., at 1106.  The court rejected the Secretary's contrary administrative construction as inconsistent with the plain language of the FPASA. Id., at 1106-1108.  Deciding in favor of the respondent on these statutory grounds, the District Court found it unnecessary to reach the respondent's alternative arguments under the Constitution.  Id., at 1108.  The court thereupon declared the road construction contract that had been entered into between the petitioners and the Indian Nations Construction Co. to be null and void, and permanently enjoined the petitioners from circumventing the advertising requirements of 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 253 in connection with the remainder of the Honobia Road project and future road construction projects.  451 F.Supp., at 1112.7\n\n\n6\nA divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the judgment.  591 F.2d 554.  Relying in large part on the analysis of the District Court, the Court of Appeals held that, whatever might arguably be the breadth of the Buy Indian Act standing alone, it had been pre-empted by the advertising requirements of the FPASA with respect to the procurement of road construction projects.  Id., at 557-559.  Alternatively, the Court of Appeals observed that it would \"require a considerable 'stretch of the imagination' to conclude that the Congress intended the Buy-Indian Act to apply to road construction projects.\"  Id., at 560.  The appellate court believed, in short, that the Act's preference for Indian \"products\" could not easily be read to include the performance of a roadway construction contract by an Indian-owned firm.  Id., at 562.  In response to the petitioners' contention that the Buy Indian Act should be construed liberally to effectuate its remedial purpose, the court observed that \"a primary, significant remedial feature of the advertisement and competitive bidding requirements of the [FPASA] is to obtain the best and lowest bid for the benefit of the American taxpayers in 'high cost' construction categories.\"  Ibid. (emphasis deleted).  We granted certiorari, 444 U.S. 962, 100 S.Ct. 448, 62 L.Ed.2d 374 to decide a question of importance in the proper exercise by the BIA of its procurement responsibilities.\n\nII\n\n7\nThe Buy Indian Act was enacted in 1910 as part of legislation that subjected the purchase of Indian supplies by the Department of the Interior to the strictures of \u00a7 3709 of the Revised Statutes.8  Section 3709, which had been in existence since 1861,9 required agencies subject to its provisions to advertise for bids on all but a few Government procurements.10 The purpose of the Buy Indian Act was clear.  Purchases by the Department of the Interior of \"the products of Indian industry\" were to be exempt from any requirement of advertising for bids imposed by \u00a7 3709 of the Revised Statutes.11\n\n\n8\nThe legislation of which the Buy Indian Act was a part was amended from time to time between 1910 and 1965, but none of these changes affected the substance of what had been enacted in 1910. The BIA, as was true of most other departments of the Government, continued to operate under a general mandate that contracts for supplies and services be let in conformity with \u00a7 3709 of the Revised Statutes.12  Section 3709, in turn, was recodified (41 U.S.C. \u00a7 5) and amended, but its basic mandate remained the same.13  Government procurement was to proceed through advertising for bids unless excepted by \u00a7 3709 or \"otherwise provided\" by laws such as the Buy Indian Act.14\n\n\n9\nIn 1965, the law affecting BIA procurement was substantially modified.  The regime of detailed contracting requirements contained in Title III of the FPASA, theretofore applicable only to the General Services Administration and to certain special procurements,15 was extended to cover the purchasing procedures of the BIA and most other executive agencies.16  See 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 252(a);  40 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 472(a), 474. For covered agencies, one consequence of this legislation was to substitute the advertising requirements set out in Title III of the FPASA for those contained in \u00a7 3709 of the Revised Statutes. See 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 260;  S.Rep. No. 274, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 1, 5 (1965);  H.R.Rep. No. 1166, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 7, 9 (1965), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1965, p. 4217;  111 Cong.Rec. 27198 (1965) (Rep. Brooks).\n\n\n10\nUnder Title III of the FPASA, the BIA must now adhere to the broad statutory mandate that \"[a]ll purchases and contracts for property and services shall be made by advertising  . . . .\"  41 U.S.C. \u00a7 252(c).  From this directive, the statute specifically excepts only 15 types of procurements, the 15th covering situations where negotiated procurements are \"otherwise authorized by law.  . . .\" \u00a7 252(c)(15) (subsection (c)(15)).\n\n\n11\nThe Buy Indian Act is clearly a \"law\" within the contemplation of subsection (c)(15).  As 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 260 expressly states:  \"Any provision of law which authorizes an executive agency  . . .  to procure any property or services without advertising or without regard to [\u00a7 3709 of the Revised Statutes, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 5] shall be construed to authorize the procurement of such property or services pursuant to section 252(c)(15) of this title without regard to the advertising requirements of  . . . this title.\"  See also S.Rep. No. 274,supra, at 5;  H.R.Rep. No. 1166, supra, at 8;  U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1965, p. 4217.  As noted above, the Buy Indian Act has from its inception authorized the BIA to \"purchas[e] the products of Indian industry\" without regard to the advertising requirements of \u00a7 3709 of the Revised Statutes.\n\n\n12\nRelying on subsection (c)(15) and \u00a7 260, the petitioners argue that the BIA proceeded correctly in awarding the Honobia Road contract to the Indian Nations Construction Co. without prior public advertising for bids.  They assert that a road constructed or repaired by an Indian-owned corporation is a \"product of Indian industry\" within the meaning of the Buy Indian Act and, accordingly, that the Honobia Road project was exempt from the FPASA's advertising rules by operation of subsection (c)(15).\n\n\n13\nIt is fairly debatable, we think, simply as a matter of language, whether a road constructed or repaired by an Indian-owned enterprise is a \"product of Indian industry\" within the meaning of the Buy Indian Act.  But even if that Act could in isolation be construed to embrace road construction or repair, the petitioners' argument must still be rejected because of another provision of Title III of the FPASA expressly relating to contracts of the sort at issue here.  Title 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 252(e) (subsection (e)) states that \u00a7 252(c) \"shall not be construed to . . .  permit any contract for the construction or repair of  . . .  roads  . . .  to be negotiated without advertising  . . ., unless  . . .  negotiation of such contract is authorized by the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (10), (11), (12), or (14) of subsection (c) of this section.\"17 Not contained in this list of exceptions is subsection (c)(15).  From this omission only one inference can be drawn:  Congress meant to bar the negotiation of road construction and repair projects under the authority of laws like the Buy Indian Act.  Where Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.  See Continental Casualty Co. v. United States, 314 U.S. 527, 533.18\n\n\n14\nIn an attempt to avoid the obvious import of subsection (e), the petitioners argue that the subsection does not apply at all to cases in which the Buy Indian Act is involved.  The petitioners reason that subsection (e) is concerned solely with procurement contracts whose negotiation is \"permitted\" by \u00a7 252, and that the negotiation authority afforded by the Buy Indian Act does not fit this description because that Act is a statute which of its own force operates independently of the FPASA.\n\n\n15\nWe read the pertinent statutes differently.  In the absence of subsection (c)(15), the Buy Indian Act could independently confer no authority on the BIA to avoid public advertising for competitive bids.  Title 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 474 provides that \"[t]he authority conferred by [the FPASA] shall be in addition and paramount to any authority conferred by any other law and shall not be SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF ANY LAW INCONSISTENT HEREWITH . . . .\"  (emphasis supplied.)  In view of \u00a7 252's broad directive that all procurement proceed through advertising, the Buy Indian Act's contrary mandate would not have survived the 1965 amendments to the FPASA had Title III of the FPASA not contained subsection (c)(15).  In short, \u00a7 252(c) \"permits\" negotiation pursuant to the Buy Indian Act and, therefore, such negotiation is limited by the special rule applicable to road construction contained in subsection (e).19\n\n\n16\nWe are, nonetheless, urged to disregard the plain meaning of subsection (e) because of the axiom that repeals by implication of longstanding statutory provisions are not favored.  See Universal Interpretive Shuttle Corp. v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Comm'n, 393 U.S. 186, 193, 89 S.Ct. 354, 358, 21 L.Ed.2d 334.  The maxim is said to be particularly compelling here because the older statute is \"remedial\" legislation for the benefit of Indians.  See Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 549-551, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 2482-2483, 41 L.Ed.2d 290.  The 1965 amendments to the FPASA did not, however, \"repeal\" the Buy Indian Act.  With the exception of the limited class of contracts enumerated in subsection (e), the FPASA did not in any manner displace the provisions of the Buy Indian Act.  Moreover, \"[t]he courts are not at liberty to pick and choose among congressional enactments, and when two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective.\"  Morton v. Mancari, supra, at 551, 94 S.Ct., at 2483.  And, although the \"rule by which legal ambiguities are resolved to the benefit of the Indians\" is to be given \"the broadest possible scope,\" \"[a] canon of construction is not a license to disregard clear expressions of  . . . congressional intent.\"  DeCoteau v. District County Court, 420 U.S. 425, 447, 95 S.Ct. 1082, 1094, 43 L.Ed.2d 300.\n\n\n17\nFor the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.20\n\n\n18\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n1\n Title 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 47 provides in full:\n\"So far as may be practicable Indian labor shall be employed, and purchases of the products of Indian industry may be made in open market in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior.\"\n\n\n2\n The Secretary of the Interior has delegated his responsibilities and powers under the Act to the Commissioner of the BIA.\n\n\n3\n 20 BIAM Bull. 1 (Mar. 3, 1976).  See also 25 CFR \u00a7 162.5a (1978);  41 CFR \u00a7 14H-3.215-70 (1977).  The Bulletin defined \"Indian contractor\" as a legal entity that is 100% Indian owned and controlled.  An \"Indian\" was defined as a member of an Indian tribe or as a person otherwise considered to be an Indian by the tribe with which affiliation is claimed.\n\n\n4\n The Bulletin admonished that, in all events, the contract price must be \"fair and reasonable.\"\n\n\n5\n At the time, the respondent was on the list of available contractors maintained by the BIA.  Previously, the respondent had competitively bid on and been awarded the contract covering another five miles of the Honobia Road.\nIn procurement parlance, contracts for which bids are publicly invited in advance are said to be let pursuant to \"advertising.\"  See 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 253;  41 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 1-2.101, 1-2.203-1, 1-2.203-2 (1979).  All other contacts are \"negotiated.\" See 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 252(c), 254;  41 CFR \u00a7 1-1.301-3 (1979).\n\n\n6\n The BIA's area road engineer had earlier estimated that the job would cost $963,117.48.\n\n\n7\n The court denied the respondent's request that Indian Nations Construction Co. be made to refund the amounts it had been paid for work already performed on the Honobia Road project before the court's entry of judgment.  451 F.Supp., at 1109, 1112.  In this connection, the District Court noted that 9.7% of the construction contract had been completed and paid for at the time of its decision.  Id., at 1109.\n\n\n8\n The Act of June 25, 1910, ch. 431, \u00a7 23, 36 Stat. 861, provided:\n\"That hereafter the purchase of Indian supplies shall be made in conformity with the requirements of section thirty-seven hundred and nine of the Revised Statutes of the United States: Provided, That so far as may be practicable Indian labor shall be employed, and purchases of the products of Indian industry may be made in open market in the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior.  All Acts and parts of Acts in conflict with the provisions of this section are hereby repealed.\"\nThe origins of this legislation lay in a series of Appropriations Acts concerning the Indian Department of the Department of the Interior.  Each of these annual Acts contained a provision whose language was similar to that of the present Buy Indian Act.  See, e. g., Act of Apr. 30, 1908, ch. 153, 35 Stat. 70;  Act of Mar. 1, 1907, ch. 2285, 34 Stat. 1015.\n\n\n9\n See Act of Mar. 2, 1861, ch. 84, \u00a7 10, 12 Stat. 220.\n\n\n10\n In 1910, \u00a7 3709 of the Revised Statutes provided in pertinent part:\n\"All purchases and contracts for supplies or services, in any of the Departments of the Government, except for personal services, shall be made by advertising a sufficient time previously for proposals respecting the same, when the public exigencies do not require the immediate delivery of the articles, or performance of the service.  When immediate delivery or performance is required by the public exigency, the articles or service required may be procured by open purchase or contract, at the places and in the manner in which such articles are usually bought and sold, or such services engaged, between individuals.\"\n\n\n11\n The structure of \u00a7 23 of the Act of June 25, 1910, evidences this intent.  See n.8, supra.  So does the Act's legislative history.  The House Report explained that \"[w]ith the exceptions noted in the proviso,\" the Buy Indian Act, \u00a7 23 \"will bring the Indian Service, like all other branches of the public service, under the provisions of section 3709 of the Revised Statutes.  . . .\"  H.R. Rep. No. 1135, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., 12 (1910).  See also 45 Cong.Rec. 6097 (1910) (Rep. Burke).\n\n\n12\n In 1926, \u00a7 23 of the 1910 Act was split into two parts for codification purposes.  The language that required the BIA to adhere to the advertising rules contained in \u00a7 3709 of the Revised Statutes was placed in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 93.  The proviso respecting the purchase of Indian goods was located in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 47.  No contemporaneous suggestion was made that this separation was intended to affect the substance of either segment of the original Act.\nIn 1940, a further change occurred.  As part of an effort to eliminate redundant provisions respecting the operation of federal agencies, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 93 was repealed and 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 6a(g) enacted in its place.  See Act of Oct. 10, 1940, ch. 851, \u00a7\u00a7 2(g), 4(a), 54 Stat. 1110, 1111, 1112.  This rearrangement made \"no changes in existing law.\"  H.R.Rep. No. 2647, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 1 (1940).  See S.Rep. No. 2135, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 2 (1940).  Then, in 1951, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 6a(g) was repealed.  See Act of Oct. 31, 1951, ch. 654, \u00a7 1(107), 65 Stat. 705.  Obsolescence seems to have led to the demise of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 93 and 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 6a(g).  See H.R.Rep. No. 1105, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., 2-3 (1951). By 1951, \u00a7 3709 of the Revised Statutes had been amended to require advertising in all cases except where small purchases were involved, where a specific exemption in \u00a7 3709 applied, or where \"otherwise provided in  . . .  other law.\"  See 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 5 (1946 ed.).\n\n\n13\n In 1964, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 5 (1964 ed.) read in pertinent part:\n\"Unless otherwise provided in the appropriation concerned or other law, purchases and contracts for supplies or services for the Government may be made or entered into only after advertising a sufficient time previously for proposals, except (1) when the amount involved in any one case does not exceed $2,500, (2) when the public exigencies require the immediate delivery of the articles or performance of the service, (3) when only one source of supply is available and the Government purchasing or contracting officer shall so certify, or (4) when the services are required to be performed by the contractor in person and are (A) of a technical and professional nature or (B) under Government supervision and paid for on a time basis.\"\n\n\n14\n Since its codification in 1926 in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 47, the Buy Indian Act has undergone no change in phraseology.\n\n\n15\n See 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 252(a) (1964 ed.).\n\n\n16\n 79 Stat. 1303.\n\n\n17\n Title 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 252(e) provides in full:\n\"This section shall not be construed to (A) authorize the erection, repair, or furnishing of any public building or public improvement, but such authorization shall be required in the same manner as heretofore, or (B) permit any contract for the construction or repair of buildings, roads, sidewalks, sewers, mains, or similar items to be negotiated without advertising as required by section 253 of this title, unless such contract is to be performed outside the continental United States or unless negotiation of such contract is authorized by the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (10), (11), (12), or (14) of subsection (c) of this section.\"\nNo contention has been made that paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (11), (12), or (14) of subsection (c) authorized negotiation of the Honobia Road project.  As to paragraph (10), see n. 20, infra.\n\n\n18\n Nothing in the legislative history of the 1965 amendments to the FPASA points in a different direction than does the plain language of the statute.  The petitioners cite the following passage found in several of the congressional Committee Reports that accompanied the 1949 version of the FPASA:\n\"For clarity [subsection (e)] provides that [41 U.S.C. \u00a7 252] does not authorize or change the existing requirements for authorization for the erection or repair of buildings, roads, sidewalks, or similar items.\"  H.R.Rep. No. 670, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 23 (1949);  S.Rep. No. 338, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 20 (1949);  S.Rep. No. 475, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 25 (1949).\nThis statement, however sheds no light on the proper disposition of the instant case.  It referred to the provisions of the FPASA at a time when that legislation governed no more than the General Services Administration and a few special procurements.\n\n\n19\n Alternatively, the petitioners contend that subsection (e) does not govern here because of \u00a7 252(a)(2).  That provision states that \u00a7\u00a7 251 through 260 of Title 41 \"d[o] not apply  . . . when [those sections are] made inapplicable pursuant to section 474 of title 40 or any other law  . . . .\"  According to the petitioners, the Buy Indian Act is an \"other law\" within the intendment of \u00a7 252(a)(2).\nWe disagree, reading subsection (a)(2) to refer exclusively to statutory provisions that\u2014unlike the Buy Indian Act\u2014in express terms exempt procurements from \u00a7\u00a7 251 through 260 of Title 41 or from the FPASA in its entirety.  Any broader reading of subsection (a)(2) would render subsection (c)(15) superfluous and would also substantially undermine Congress' desire that the requirements of \u00a7 254 apply \"to contracts negotiated by executive agencies under any law, not only title III.\"  S.Rep. No. 274, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1965);  H.R.Rep. No. 1166, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1965), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1965, pp. 4217, 4218. (Emphasis added.)  See id., at 2-3, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, 1965, pp. 4217, 4218.\n\n\n20\n The petitioners have requested that, if their basic arguments are rejected, this case, nonetheless, be remanded to the Court of Appeals for further consideration in light of 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 252(c)(10), which authorizes the negotiation of Government contracts \"for property or services for which it is impracticable to secure competition.\"  The petitioners, however, did not rely on this statutory provision in defending this lawsuit in the District Court, and the Court of Appeals did not consider it.  Our affirmance of the judgment of the Court of Appeals does not preclude the petitioners from seeking relief from the outstanding injunction on this ground or any other.  See NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 165, n. 30, 95 S.Ct. 1504, 1523, 44 L.Ed.2d 29.  See also Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 60(b).\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"433 U.S. 165\n97 S.Ct. 2616\n53 L.Ed.2d 667\nPUYALLUP TRIBE, INC. and Ramona Bennett, Petitioners,v.DEPARTMENT OF GAME OF the STATE OF WASHINGTON et al.\nNo. 76-423.\nArgued April 18, 1977.\nDecided June 23, 1977.\n\nSyllabus\nAfter protracted litigation the Washington Superior Court entered a judgment against petitioner Puyallup Tribe reciting that the court possessed jurisdiction to regulate the Tribe's fishing activities both off and on its reservation, and limiting the number of steelhead trout that tribal members might net in the Puyallup River each year, and the Tribe was directed to file a list of members authorized to exercise treaty fishing rights, and to report to respondent Washington Department of Game and to the court the number of steelhead caught by the treaty fishermen each week. The Washington Supreme Court affirmed, with a slight modification. The Tribe contends that the doctrine of sovereign immunity requires that the judgment be vacated; that the state courts have no jurisdiction to regulate fishing activities on the reservation; and that, in any event, the limitation on the steelhead catch is not a necessary conservation measure. Held:\n1. Absent an effective waiver or consent, a state court may not exercise jurisdiction over a recognized Indian tribe, but tribal sovereign immunity here does not impair the Superior Court's authority to adjudicate the rights of individual tribal members over whom it properly obtained personal jurisdiction, Puyallup Tribe v. Washington Game Dept., 391 U.S. 392, 88 S.Ct. 1725, 20 L.Ed.2d 689 (Puyallup I ), and hence only those portions of the judgment that involve relief against the Tribe itself must be vacated in order to honor the Tribe's valid claim of immunity. Pp. 168-173.\n2. Neither the Tribe nor its members have an exclusive right, under the Treaty of Medicine Creek, to take steelhead passing through the reservation. It not only appears that the Tribe, pursuant to Acts of Congress passed after the treaty was entered into, alienated in fee simple absolute all areas of the reservation abutting on the Puyallup River, but, moreover, the Tribe's treaty right to fish \"at all usual and accustomed places\" is to be exercised \"in common with all citizens of the Territory,\" Puyallup I, supra, at 398, 88 S.Ct. at 1728, and is subject to reasonable regulation by the State pursuant to its power to conserve an important natural resource. The fair apportionment of the steelhead catch between Indian net fishing and non-Indian sport fishing directed by Washington Game Dept. v. Puyallup Tribe, 414 U.S. 44, 94 S.Ct. 330, 38 L.Ed.2d 254 (Puyallup II ), could not be effective if the Indians retained the power to take an unlimited number of steelhead within the reservation. Pp. 173-177.\n3. It appears that the state court complied with the mandate of Puyallup Tribe II, supra, at 48-49, 94 S.Ct. at 333, and used a proper standard of conservation necessity in limiting the steelhead catch, where such limitation was based primarily on expert testimony for both parties. P. 177.\n4. Although the Tribe properly resists the state courts' authority to order it to provide information with respect to the status of tribal members and the size of their catch, it may find that its members' interests are best served by voluntarily providing such information, but the state courts on remand must continue to respect the Tribe's right to participate in the proceedings without treating such participation as qualifying the Tribe's right to claim sovereign immunity. P. 178.\n86 Wash.2d 664, 548 P.2d 1058, vacated and remanded.\nWilliam H. Rodgers, Jr., Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\nH. Bartow Farr, Washington, D. C., for the United States, as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\nDon S. Willner, Portland, Or., for respondents, Northwest Steelheaders Council of Trout Unlimited and Gary Ellis.\nSlade Gorton, Olympia, Wash., for respondent Dept. of Game of State of Wash.\nMr. Justice STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nOn April 8, 1975, after more than 12 years of litigation, including two decisions by this Court,1 the Superior Court of the State of Washington for Pierce County entered a judgment against the Puyallup Tribe of Indians. That judgment recited that the court had jurisdiction to regulate the fishing activities of the Tribe both on and off its reservation, and limited the number of steelhead trout that members of the Tribe may catch with nets in the Puyallup River each year. The Tribe was directed to file a list of members authorized to exercise treaty fishing rights, and to report to the Washington State Department of Game, and to the court, the number of steelhead caught by its treaty fishermen each week. The judgment, with a slight modification, was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Washington, 86 Wash.2d 664, 548 P.2d 1058 (1976).\n\n\n2\nThe Tribe, supported by the United States as amicus curiae, contends in this Court that the doctrine of sovereign immunity requires that the judgment be vacated, and that the state courts of Washington are without jurisdiction to regulate fishing activities on its reservation. The Tribe also argues that the limitation of the steelhead catch imposed by those courts is not, in any event, a necessary conservation measure. We hold that insofar as the claim of sovereign immunity is advanced on behalf of the Tribe, rather than the individual defendants, it is well founded, but we reject petitioner Tribe's other contentions.\n\n\n3\n* The complaint as originally filed by respondent Department of Game of the State of Washington (hereafter respondent),2 named 41 individuals, including \"John Doe and Jane Doe, members (of the Tribe),\"3 as defendants. It alleged that the defendants, claiming to be immune from the State's conservation laws, were fishing extensively in the Puyallup River with set nets and drift nets in a manner which would virtually exterminate the anadromous fishery if not enjoined. Anadromous fish are those which spend most of their life in the open sea, but which return as adults to freshwater streams, such as the Puyallup River, to spawn. The steelhead is an anadromous fish. The prayer of the complaint sought a declaration that the defendants were bound to obey the State's conservation laws and an injunction against netting the runs of anadromous fish.\n\n\n4\nThe trial court entered a temporary restraining order enjoining each of the defendants from netting fish in the Puyallup River, and directing that service be made on each defendant.\n\n\n5\nIn response, a \"Return on Temporary Restraining Order and Answer to Complaint\" was filed by \"the PUYALLUP TRIBE of INDIANS, by and through the Chairman of the Tribal Council, MR. JEROME MATHESON.\" App. in Puyallup I, O.T. 1967, No. 247, 8 (hereafter App. in Puyallup I ). The return and answer used the term \"tribe\" in two senses, first as a collective synonym for the individual defendant-members,4 and also as referring to a sovereign Indian nation.5 It asserted an exclusive right to the fish in the Puyallup River, describing that right somewhat ambiguously as a \"property right which belongs to the Tribe and is exercised by the Tribe members under the Treaty of Medicine Creek.\" Ibid. Therefore, while filed in the name of the Tribe, the return and answer was also tendered on behalf of the individual defendants.6\n\n\n6\nThroughout this long litigation the Tribe has continued to participate in the dual capacity of a sovereign entity7 and as a representative of its members who were individual defendants.8 The Tribe has repeatedly asserted its sovereign immunity from suit, arguing that neither it nor Congress has waived that immunity.9\n\n\n7\nIn Puyallup I, we addressed the problems of tribal immunity and state-court jurisdiction in a footnote:\n\n\n8\n\"Petitioners in No. 247 argue that the Washington courts      lacked jurisdiction to entertain an action against the tribe without the consent of the tribe or the United      States Government (citing United States v. United States      Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 309 U.S. 506, 60 S.Ct. 653, 84 L.Ed.      894, and Turner v. United States, 248 U.S. 354, 39 S.Ct. 109,      63 L.Ed. 291), viewing the suit as one to 'extinguish a      Tribal communal fishing right guaranteed by federal Treaty.'      This case, however, is a suit to enjoin violations of state      law by individual tribal members fishing off the reservation.      As such, it is analogous to prosecution of individual Indians      for crimes committed off reservation lands, a matter for      which there has been no grant of exclusive jurisdiction to      federal courts.\" 391 U.S. 392, 396-397, n. 11, 88 S.Ct. 1725,      1727, 20 L.Ed.2d 689.\n\n\n9\nThus, Puyallup I settled an important threshold question in this case regardless of tribal sovereign immunity, individual defendant-members of the Puyallup Tribe remain amenable to the process of the Washington courts in connection with fishing activities occurring off their reservation. That conclusion was predicated on two separate propositions worthy of restatement here.\n\n\n10\nFirst, even though the individual defendants were members of the Tribe and therefore entitled to the benefits of the Treaty of Medicine Creek, that treaty as construed by this Court does not confer the complete individual immunity they claim. The State may qualify the Indians' right to fish \"at all usual and accustomed places.\" Specifically, we held that the \"manner of fishing, the size of the take, the restriction of commercial fishing, and the like may be regulated by the State in the interest of conservation, provided the regulation meets appropriate standards and does not discriminate against the Indians.\" Id., at 398, 88 S.Ct. at 1728.\n\n\n11\nSecond, whether or not the Tribe itself may be sued in a state court without its consent or that of Congress, a suit to enjoin violations of state law by individual tribal members is permissible. The doctrine of sovereign immunity which was applied in United States v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 309 U.S. 506, 60 S.Ct. 653, 84 L.Ed. 894, does not immunize the individual members of the Tribe.10\n\n\n12\nAlthough only the Tribe had entered an appearance in this Court in Puyallup I, because of its representation of its individual members, jurisdiction over the individuals existed. And since the state court's jurisdiction over the individual members was settled by Puyallup I, neither in that review nor in Puyallup II was any further consideration given to the status of the Tribe itself as a sovereign. It was after our decision in Puyallup II, when the trial court was required to determine the portion of the steelhead run that could be allocated to net fishing by the members of the Tribe, that the state court first entered an order which, in terms, is directed to the Tribe rather than to the individual defendants. That order places a limit on the number of steelhead which all members of the Tribe may catch with nets and also directs the Tribe to identify the members engaged in the steelhead fishery and to report the number of fish they catch each week. In the trial court, in the Supreme Court of Washington, and in this Court, the Tribe has attacked that order as an infringement on its sovereign immunity to which neither it nor Congress has consented.\n\n\n13\nThe attack is well founded. Absent an effective waiver or consent, it is settled that a state court may not exercise jurisdiction over a recognized Indian tribe. This Court, United States v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. supra; the Washington Supreme Court, see, e. g., State ex rel. Adams v. Superior Court, 57 Wash.2d 181, 182-185, 356 P.2d 985, 987-988 (1960); and the commentators, see, e. g., U.S. Dept of Interior, Federal Indian Law 491-494 (1958), all concur. Respondent does not argue that either the Tribe or Congress has waived its claim of immunity or consented to the entry of an order against it. And certainly, the mere fact that the Tribe has appeared on behalf of its individual members does not effect a waiver of sovereign immunity for the Tribe itself.\n\n\n14\nOn the other hand, the successful assertion of tribal sovereign immunity in this case does not impair the authority of the state court to adjudicate the rights of the individual defendants over whom it properly obtained personal jurisdiction. That court had jurisdiction to decide questions relating to the allocation between the hatchery fish and the natural run, the size of the catch the tribal members may take in their nets, their right to participate in hook-and-line fishing without paying state license fees and without having fish so caught diminish the size of their allowable net catch, and like questions. Only the portions of the state-court order that involve relief against the Tribe itself must be vacated in order to honor the Tribe's valid claim of immunity.\n\nII\n\n15\nThe Tribe vigorously argues that the majority of its members' netting of steelhead takes place inside its reservation,11 and that, while our prior adjudications settled respondent's right to regulate off-reservation fishing in the interest of conservation, neither respondent nor the state court has jurisdiction over on-reservation fishing. The Tribe relies on both the Treaty of Medicine Creek, 10 Stat. 1132, and federal pre-emption of on-reservation Indian affairs, see Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U.S. 145, 147-148, 93 S.Ct. 1267, 1269-1270, 36 L.Ed.2d 114.\n\n\n16\nArticle II of the Treaty of Medicine Creek provided that the Puyallup Reservation was to be \"set apart, and, so far as necessary, surveyed and marked out for their exclusive use\" and that no \"white man (was to) be permitted to reside upon the same without permission of the tribe and the superintendent or agent.\" It is argued that these words amount to a reservation of a right to fish free of state interference. Such an interpretation clashes with the subsequent history of the reservation and the facts of this case. Pursuant to two Acts of Congress, 27 Stat. 633, and c. 1816, 33 Stat. 565, the Puyallups alienated, in fee simple absolute, all but 22 acres of their 18,000-acre reservation. None of the 22 acres abuts on the Puyallup River.12 Neither the Tribe nor its members continue to hold Puyallup River fishing grounds for their \"exclusive use.\" On the contrary, it is undisputed that non-Indian licensees of respondent fish in great numbers within the reservation, and under the close supervision of respondent's wardens.13\n\n\n17\nAlthough it is conceded that the State of Washington exercises civil and criminal jurisdiction within the reservation for most purposes, petitioner contends that it may not do so with respect to fishing.14 Again with particular reference to the facts of this case, we also reject this contention.\n\n\n18\nOur construction of the Treaty of Medicine Creek in Puyallup I makes it perfectly clear that although the State may not deny the Indians their right to fish \"at all usual and accustomed\" places, the treaty right is to be exercised \"in common with all citizens of the Territory.\" We squarely held that \"the right to fish at those respective places is not an exclusive one.\" 391 U.S., at 398, 88 S.Ct., at 1728. Rather, the exercise of that right was subject to reasonable regulation by the State pursuant to its power to conserve an important natural resource.\n\n\n19\nIn Puyallup II we directed the Washington State courts to devise a formula pursuant to which the steelhead catch could be \"fairly apportioned\" between Indian net fishing and non-Indian sport fishing. No such fair apportionment could be effective if the Indians retained the power to take an unlimited number of anadromous fish within the reservation. Speaking for the Court, Mr. Justice Douglas plainly stated that the power of the State is adequate to assure the survival of the steelhead:\n\n\n20\n\"We do not imply that these fishing rights persist down to      the very last steelhead in the river. Rights can be      controlled by the need to conserve a species; and the time      may come when the life of a steelhead is so precarious in a      particular stream that all fishing should be banned until the species regains assurance of survival. The police power      of the State is adequate to prevent the steelhead from      following the fate of the passenger pigeon; and the Treaty      does not give the Indians a federal right to pursue the last      living steelhead until it enters their nets.\" 414 U.S., at      49, 94 S.Ct., at 333.\n\n\n21\nThe resource being regulated is indigenous to the Puyallup River. Virtually all adult steelhead in the river have returned after being spawned or planted by respondent upstream from the boundaries of the original Puyallup Reservation, which encompass the lowest seven miles of the river. Though it would be decidedly unwise, if Puyallup treaty fishermen were allowed untrammeled on-reservation fishing rights, they could interdict completely the migrating fish run and \"pursue the last living (Puyallup River) steelhead until it enters their nets.\" Ibid.15 In this manner the treaty fishermen could totally frustrate both the jurisdiction of the Washington courts and the rights of the non-Indian citizens of Washington recognized in the Treaty of Medicine Creek.16 In practical effect, therefore, the petitioner is reasserting the right to exclusive control of the steelhead run that was unequivocally rejected in both Puyallup I and Puyallup II. At this stage of this protracted litigation, we are unwilling to re-examine those unanimous decisions or to render their holdings virtually meaningless. We therefore reject petitioner's claim to an exclusive right to take steelhead while passing through its reservation.\n\nIII\n\n22\nFinally, petitioner states that the courts below have failed to apply a standard of conservation necessity in fashioning relief. We disagree. The trial court, on remand from our decision in Puyallup II, conducted a two-week trial which was dominated by expert testimony for both parties. From the testimony and accompanying exhibits the court determined the number of steelhead in the river and how many could be taken without diminishing the number in future years; the court then allocated 45% of the annual natural steelhead run available for taking to the treaty fishermen's net fishery.17 The Washington Supreme Court affirmed, 86 Wash.2d, at 684-687, 548 P.2d, at 1072-1073. This is precisely what we mandated in Puyallup II, 414 U.S., at 48-49, 94 S.Ct., at 333. In the absence of a focused attack on some portion of the Washington courts' factual determinations, we find no ground for disagreeing with them.18\n\n\n23\nA practical problem is presented by our disposition. The limitation on the size of the net catch applies to all members of the Tribe. The respondent has no interest in how the catch is allocated among the Indians; its concern is with the total number of steelhead netted during each season, with obtaining information to make it possible to recommend a proper allocation in succeeding years, and with enforcement against individuals who may net fish after the allowable limit has been reached. On the other hand, the Tribe has a separate interest in affording equitable treatment to its members and in protecting those members from any mistaken enforcement efforts. For that reason, although it properly resists the authority of the state court to order it to provide information with respect to the status of enrolled members of the Tribe and the size of their catch, it may find that its members' interests are best served by voluntarily providing such information to respondent and to the court in order to minimize the risk of an erroneous enforcement effort. The state courts must continue to accord full respect to the Tribe's right to participate in the proceedings on behalf of its members as it has in the past without treating such participation as qualifying its right to claim immunity as a sovereign.\n\n\n24\nThe judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Supreme Court of Washington for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion.\n\n\n25\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n26\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN, cuncurring.\n\n\n27\nI join the Court's opinion. I entertain doubts, however, about the continuing vitality in this day of the doctrine of tribal immunity as it was enunciated in United States v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 309 U.S. 506, 60 S.Ct. 653, 84 L.Ed. 894 (1940). I am of the view that that doctrine may well merit re-examination in an appropriate case.\n\n\n28\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting in part.\n\n\n29\nWhile I agree with the Court's resolution of the rather tangled sovereign immunity question in Part I of the opinion, I cannot agree with the Court's interpretation of the substantive rights of the Puyallup Indians under the Treaty of Medicine Creek.\n\n\n30\nWhen white settlers first began arriving in the western part of what is now Washington State, the Puyallup Indians, along with other tribes surrounding Puget Sound, were heavily dependent for their livelihoods on runs of salmon and steelhead that came up the rivers in great numbers to spawn. In the 1850's the first territorial Governor, Isaac I. Stevens, entered into a number of virtually identical treaties with representatives of these western Washington tribes to confine the Indians to reservation lands, and to open up the rest of the region to white settlers. One of these treaties was the Treaty of Medicine Creek, negotiated in 1854 by Governor Stevens with the Puyallups, the neighboring Nisqually Tribe, and other bands. That treaty gave the Puyallups a reservation at the southern end of Commencement Bay at the mouth of the Puyallup River.\n\n\n31\nThe provisions for the Indians' all-important fishing rights stated:\n\n\n32\n\"Article II. There is . . . reserved for the present use and      occupation of the said tribes and bands (reservation land      which) shall be set apart, and, so far as necessary, surveyed      and marked out for their exclusive use . . . .\n\n\n33\n\"Article III. The right of taking fish, at all usual and      accustomed grounds and stations, is further secured to said      Indians, in common with all citizens of the Territory . . .      .\" 10 Stat. 1132, 1333. (Emphasis supplied.) As I understand the Court's reading of these provisions, with which I agree, Art. II guarantees exclusive use of the reservation, including exclusive fishing rights, to the Puyallups. Article III concerns fishing rights off the reservation, guaranteeing such rights at all \"usual and accustomed grounds and stations,\" not, however, exclusively but \"in common with all the citizens of the Territory.\"\n\n\n34\nThe two questions presented are, first, what fishing rights do the Puyallup Indians have now, over 100 years after the signing of the treaty?; and, second, to what extent is the State of Washington empowered to limit those rights? We do not write on a clean slate as to either question in light of Puyallup I, 391 U.S. 392, 88 S.Ct. 1725, 20 L.Ed.2d 689, decided in 1968, and Puyallup II, 414 U.S. 44, 94 S.Ct. 330, 38 L.Ed.2d 254, decided in 1973.\n\n\n35\nPuyallup I, presented no question of the \"extent of . . . reservation rights,\" but only the question of the power of the State \"to enjoin violations of state (fishing regulations) by individual tribal members fishing off the reservation.\" 391 U.S., at 394, 397 n.11, 88 S.Ct., at 1727.1 Puyallup I held that Washington's power to regulate off-reservation fishing for salmon and steelhead by the Puyallups was limited to regulations necessary in the interest of conservation, id., at 398, 88 S.Ct., at 1728, and remanded for a determination by the Washington State courts of reasonable and necessary conservation measures, and for an interpretation of the phrase \"in common with all the citizens of the Territory\" contained in Art. III of the treaty. The Washington Supreme Court's response on remand was to sustain a total ban on all net fishing for steelhead. 80 Wash.2d 561, 497 P.2d 171 (1972).2 In consequence, the case returned here as Puyallup II, which held that the interpretation of Art. III as permitting the total ban was erroneous. The Court again remanded the case, this time for a determination of a means of \"fairly apportion(ing)\" the steelhead run between the hook-and-line sports fishery and the Puyallups' net fishery. 414 U.S., at 48, 94 S.Ct., at 333. It was again made explicit that only \"off-reservation fishing,\" governed by Art. III of the treaty, was involved. Id., at 45, 94 S.Ct., at 331.\n\n\n36\nBefore proceedings began on remand, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decided a separate case in which the State of Washington challenged \"the continued existence of the Puyallup Indian Reservation and as a consequence, the right of the Puyallup Tribe of Indians to fish, free from state interference, on that part of the Puyallup River lying within the Reservation.\" Relying on Mattz v. Arnett, 412 U.S. 481, 93 S.Ct. 2245, 37 L.Ed.2d 92 (1973), the Court of Appeals held \"that the Puyallup Indian reservation continues to exist.\" United States v. Washington, 496 F.2d 620, 621 (1974) (emphasis supplied). The Washington Supreme Court, referring to the \"recently established, continuing existence of the Puyallup Indian Reservation,\" accepted the holding of the Court of Appeals, but nevertheless concluded that the State was not foreclosed from exercising regulatory authority within the reservation. 86 Wash.2d 664, 668-669, 548 P.2d 1058, 1063-1064 (1976). The court construed Art. III of the treaty to require that the Puyallups be allocated 45% of the harvestable natural-run steelhead for their net fishery, and that the remaining 55% be allocated to the hook-and-line sports fishery. The court further held that none of the harvestable hatchery-bred steelhead should be allocated to the Puyallups' net fishery. Thus, despite its acceptance of the Court of Appeals' holding that the reservation still existed, the Washington Supreme Court applied Art. III of the treaty limited by its terms to off-reservation fishing to on-reservation fishing governed by Art. II.\n\n\n37\nUnlike either Puyallup I or Puyallup II, the case before us must be determined under Art. II, which in plainest English provides for \"exclusive\" fishing rights for the Puyallups. Article II cannot be read, in my view, to sanction the apportionment of harvestable fish between the Puyallups and other fishermen. Nor has this Court ever decided whether a State has the power to regulate on-reservation fishing in the interest of conservation. See Mattz v. Arnett, supra, 412 U.S. at 485, 93 S.Ct. at 22483. I would therefore reverse. I would remand, as we did in Mattz, for a determination by the state courts in the first instance of what measures, if any, are necessary to regulate the Puyallups' on-reservation fishery for conservation purposes.4\n\n\n38\nThe Court tries to avoid the force of this analysis by denigrating the holding of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Court states: \"The continued existence of the Puyallup Reservation has been a matter of dispute on which we express no opinion. . . . (The Ninth Circuit's) decision predates our consideration of DeCoteau v. District County Court, 420 U.S. 425, 95 S.Ct. 1082, 43 L.Ed.2d 300, and Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. Kneip, 430 U.S. 584, 97 S.Ct. 1361, 51 L.Ed.2d 660.\" Ante, at 173 n.11. This, to say the least, is a casual disregard of settled principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel. The United States and the State of Washington were parties to the action in the Court of Appeals, and surely we must assume, in the absence of any suggestion to the contrary, that the parties fully litigated their positions respecting reservation status. The Court of Appeals squarely held, contrary to the contention of the State of Washington, that the reservation continued to exist, and review here was denied. Washington v. United States, 419 U.S. 1032, 95 S.Ct. 513, 42 L.Ed.2d 307 (1974). The Supreme Court of Washington in the case now before us accepted the Ninth Circuit's holding as federal law binding on it. It is inappropriate now for the Court to denigrate the impact of that holding, particularly when the result is to vest authority in the State that lost on just that issue in the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n39\nThe Court also questions whether on-reservation fishing is at issue in this case, relying on the fact that the Puyallups have alienated almost all of their land, and that only 22 acres of the reservation now remain in trust status. Ante, at 174. The Court does not go so far as to deny the existence of the reservation, and, of course, selling reservation land to non-Indians can be \"completely consistent with continued reservation status.\" Mattz v. Arnett, supra, 412 U.S., at 497, 93 S.Ct., at 2254; Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. Kneip, 430 U.S. 584, 586-587, 97 S.Ct. 1361, 1362-1363, 51 L.Ed.2d 660 (1977); DeCoteau v. District County Court, 420 U.S. 425, 432, 444, 95 S.Ct. 1082, 1087, 1092, 43 L.Ed.2d 300 (1975). Nor does the Court, or indeed any party, contend that somehow the sale of most of the lands included the sale of the exclusive fishing rights the Puyallups were granted by Art. II. The Court's argument seems to be that since the Puyallups do not now \"hold Puyallup River fishing grounds for their 'exclusive use' \" they have forfeited any claim to enforce their exclusive fishing rights under Art. II. Ante, at 174. This analysis ignores the fact that the Puyallups do not now hold their fishing grounds for their exclusive use precisely because the State has relentlessly sought for many years to prevent their doing so. Indeed, this very suit was begun 14 years ago in an effort to prevent the Puyallups from exercising what they claimed to be their treaty rights on their old reservation.\n\n\n40\nToday's decision, ironically, is at odds with the position taken by the State in another case involving Indian fishing rights in Puget Sound. There the State agreed that on-reservation fishing is not subject to regulation by the State. In United States v. Washington, 384 F.Supp. 312, 332 (W.D.Wash.1974) aff'd 520 F.2d 676 (CA9 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1086, 96 S.Ct. 877, 47 L.Ed.2d 97 (1976), District Judge Boldt, construed the language of Art. II of the Treaty of Medicine Creek and that of virtually identical treaties entered into by Governor Stevens with other western Washington tribes to mean that \"(a)n exclusive right of fishing was reserved by the tribes within the area and boundary waters of their reservations, wherein tribal members might make their homes if they chose to do so.\" (Footnote omitted; emphasis in original.) This proposition was apparently so self-evident to the parties, including the State of Washington, that \"(a)ll parties in this case agree(d) that on reservation fishing is not subject to state regulation . . . .\" 384 F.Supp., at 341.5\n\n\n41\nDoubtless 14 years of litigation have made the Court anxious to bring this case to an end, and this explains today's holding just broad enough to dispose of the Puyallups' substantive claims but so narrowly fact-specific that it will probably have no significant impact on the Puget Sound Indian fishing rights case still pending in the District Court. This suggests that the result would not be the same were the case here for the first time instead of the third. For the language of the treaty is very clear: On-reservation fishing is governed by Art. II.\n\n\n42\nI respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n In Puyallup Tribe v. Dept. of Game of Washington, et al., 391 U.S. 392, 88 S.Ct. 1725, 20 L.Ed.2d 689 (Puyallup I ), the Court held that Art. III of the Treaty of Medicine Creek, 10 Stat. 1133, did not foreclose reasonable state regulation, in the interest of conservation, of fishing by the Indians \"in common with\" fishing by others; the Court remanded the case to the state court to determine whether a total ban on net fishing was justified by the interest in conservation.\nIn Washington Game Dept. v. Puyallup Tribe, 414 U.S. 44, 94 S.Ct. 330, 38 L.Ed.2d 254 (Puyallup II ), the Court held that a complete ban on net fishing for steelhead trout by the Indians was precluded by the treaty, and remanded for a determination of the number of catchable fish that should be apportioned to an Indian net fishery.\n\n\n2\n Respondent regulates steelhead fishing in the State of Washington. The Washington Department of Fisheries was a coplaintiff with respondent in the original complaint by virtue of its responsibility for salmon fishing. After this Court's decision in Puyallup I, the Department of Fisheries amended its regulation to allow members of the Tribe to use a net fishery for salmon. No issue relating to salmon fishing remains in the case.\n\n\n3\n Three of the named individuals were further identified as tribal officers.\n\n\n4\n I. e., \"Answering Paragraph No. 1 these defendants being a tribe of Indians . . . ,\" App in Puyallup I, p. 8; \"the defendants have suffered numerous arrests, jailing and other indignities at the hands of the plaintiffs who knowingly and wilfully badger, abuse and degrade the defendants . . . ,\" id., at 9; \"(t)hat the plaintiffs are recklessly using the power of the State of Washington to deprive the defendant (sic ) and each of them of their means of making a livelihood . . . ,\" id., at 10.\n\n\n5\n I. e., \"this Tribe of Indians signed a treaty with the United States of America as a sovereign nation of Indians . . .\"; \"the Puyallup Tribe of Indians own the fish in the river . . . .\" Ibid.\n\n\n6\n The trial court so found: \"Defendants answered and alleged that they were members of the Puyallup Tribe of Indians . . . .\" Id., at 31. Finding of Fact I.\n\n\n7\n The Tribe has been described several ways in the captions which have been filed over the years. In this Court this Term the Tribe has described itself as \"Puyallup Tribe, Inc.\" The Washington Supreme Court has thrice noted that there is no such entity, see 86 Wash.2d 664, 666 n. 1, 548 P.2d 1058, 1062 n. 1 (1975). In Puyallup I the trial court held that the Tribe had ceased to exist; this holding was reversed by the Washington Supreme Court, 70 Wash.2d 245, 252-253, 422 P.2d 754, 758-759 (1967). It has therefore been settled in this case that, whatever its correct name may be, the Tribe is still in existence and is clearly recognized as such by the United States.\nIn this Court Ramona Bennett is a copetitioner with the Tribe. She appears in her capacity as chairwoman of the Puyallup Tribal Council. Accordingly, we treat this case as though the Tribe itself is the only petitioner in this Court and hereafter use the term \"petitioner\" to refer to the Tribe.\n\n\n8\n On a few occasions individual tribal members have been represented by attorneys who filed appearances in the Superior Court for Pierce County. On at least two occasions attorneys have filed appearances in the Washington Supreme Court in this capacity. No such appearance has been filed since the decision in Puyallup II in 1973. No appearance on behalf of an individual defendant was ever filed in this Court. Nor does the record reveal any instance of an objection to the Tribe's representation of the individual defendants. It is clear from the record that the major responsibility for the defense of the litigation has been assumed by the Tribe.\n\n\n9\n It has relied on Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 8 L.Ed. 483, and United States v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 309 U.S. 506, 60 S.Ct. 653, 84 L.Ed. 894. Only twice in this litigation has petitioner failed to clearly raise the issue of its tribal sovereign immunity. The first time was in its first return and answer, supra, at 168-169. The immunity issue was later presented to the trial court, however, and the court in the course of concluding that the Puyallup Tribe had ceased to exist, held in its memorandum decision that \"this argument about the tribe being a sovereign nation is without merit.\" App. in Puyallup I, p. 18. As already noted, n. 7, supra, the trial court's holding that the Tribe had ceased to exist was reversed by the Washington Supreme Court. Second, during the representation of the Tribe by the Solicitor General before this Court in Puyallup II, no mention was made of tribal sovereign immunity. Congress has not given the Solicitor General authority to waive the immunity of an Indian tribe. United States v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. supra, at 513, 60 S.Ct., at 656-657; cf. Ford Motor Co. v. Dept. of Treasury of Indiana, 323 U.S. 459, 466-470, 65 S.Ct. 347, 351-353, 89 L.Ed. 389.\n\n\n10\n That case involved an action brought in a federal court by the United States on behalf of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations to recover royalties under a mineral lease; defendant was the lessee's surety. In an earlier bankruptcy proceeding, the lessee had obtained a judgment for $9,060.90 pursuant to a cross-claim against the same tribes. In the Fidelity case the lessee's surety pleaded the earlier judgment as a bar to recovery in the action for royalties. We held that the earlier judgment was void in the absence of congressional authorization for a suit, 309 U.S., at 512-513, 60 S.Ct., at 655-656. There were no individual parties to the proceeding.\n\n\n11\n The continued existence of the Puyallup Reservation has been a matter of dispute on which we express no opinion. The Ninth Circuit, relying on our decision in Mattz v. Arnett, 412 U.S. 481, 93 S.Ct. 2245, 37 L.Ed.2d 92 held that the reservation did still exist, United States v. Washington, 496 F.2d 620 (1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1032, 95 S.Ct. 513, 42 L.Ed.2d 307. That decision predates our consideration of DeCoteau v. District County Court, 420 U.S. 425, 95 S.Ct. 1082, 43 L.Ed.2d 300, and Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. Kneip, 430 U.S. 584, 97 S.Ct. 1361, 51 L.Ed.2d 660.\n\n\n12\n 70 Wash.2d, at 253, 422 P.2d, at 759 (Puyallup I ). Counsel for petitioner intimated at oral argument that petitioner might contend in the future that it retained trust status title to the bed of the Puyallup River, Tr. of Oral Arg. 10. This contention is at odds with the otherwise uncontradicted findings below.\n\n\n13\n The tribal members' right to fish \"at all usual and accustomed grounds and stations,\" secured by Art. III of the treaty, continues to protect their right to fish on ceded lands within the confines of the reservation.\n\n\n14\n Washington has acquired \"Pub.L. 280\" jurisdiction over the Puyallup Reservation, much of which coexists with the city of Tacoma. Pub.L. No. 280, \u00a7 7, 67 Stat. 590; Wash.Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 37.12.010.-37.12.070 (1974). A provision of Pub.L. 280 exempts treaty fishing rights from state jurisdiction, however, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1162(b).\n\n\n15\n The original complaint in this case alleged that, \"(a)s a result of the defendants' fishery, the anadromous fish runs of the Puyallup River will be virtually exterminated if said fishery is permitted to continue.\" App. in Puyallup I, p. 6.\nThe ability of the on-reservation activity to completely destroy the resource in question has not been a factor in other cases which have rejected regulation, Arnett v. Five Gill Nets, 48 Cal.App.3d 454, 463-464, 121 Cal.Rptr. 906, 912-913 (1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 907, 96 S.Ct. 1500, 47 L.Ed.2d 757 (on remand from this Court, Mattz v. Arnett, supra, where the on-reservation fishing regulation question was reserved, 412 U.S., at 485, 93 S.Ct., at 2248; People v. Jondreau, 384 Mich. 539, 185 N.W.2d 375 (1971); State v. Arthur, 74 Idaho 251, 261 P.2d 135 (1953), cert. denied, 347 U.S. 937, 74 S.Ct. 627, 98 L.Ed. 1087; State v. McConville, 65 Idaho 46, 139 P.2d 485 (1943).\n\n\n16\n \"Article III. The right of taking fish, at all usual and accustomed grounds and stations, is further secured to said Indians, in common with all citizens of the Territory.\" 10 Stat. 1133. As to the treaty fishermen, this sentence effects a reservation of a previously exclusive right. But that language also recognizes that the right is to be shared in common with the non-Indian \"citizens of the Territory.\"\n\n\n17\n The courts below also held that the run of hatchery fish introduced into the Puyallup by respondent was not available to the treaty fishermen. The issue was not presented in the petition for certiorari, nor was it argued in petitioner's brief. Respondent did attempt to raise the issue in its untimely cross-petition for certiorari, and by its brief arguing affirmance. Because the question has no bearing on our decision of the questions presented by petitioner, we decline to decide it.\n\n\n18\n But for the direction of relief against the Tribe, the order of the Superior Court is admirably narrow in scope and well suited to effect a minimum of intrusion upon the treaty fishermen's protected rights. The treaty fishermen are free to fish up to the limit imposed by the court without any restriction as to time, place, or method of fishing.\n\n\n1\n The question of whether the Puyallups' reservation continued to exist was not reached. 391 U.S., at 394 n. 1, 88 S.Ct., at 1726.\n\n\n2\n The state court also sustained a regulation permitting some net fishing by the Puyallups for salmon. Review of that holding was not sought here.\n\n\n3\n Mattz v. Arnett held that the Klamath River Reservation in California had not been extinguished, but intimated no view on the authority of California to regulate fishing on the reservation. 412 U.S., at 485, 93 S.Ct., at 2248. The Klamath River has an anadromous fishery comparable to that on the Puyallup River, in that fishermen allowed net fishing can prevent all fish in a given run from reaching their spawning grounds. On remand in Mattz, the California Court of Appeal expressed doubt that the State could regulate on-reservation fishing even in the interest of conservation, but did not decide the issue because the Indians' fishing activity was found not to be a sufficient threat to conservation to justify state regulation. Arnett v. Five Gill Nets, 48 Cal.App.3d 454, 463-464, 121 Cal.Rptr. 906, 912-913 (1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 907, 96 S.Ct. 1500, 47 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976).\n\n\n4\n The degree of danger to the survival of the anadromous fishery in the Puyallup River posed by the Puyallups' net fishing has been a matter of dispute in this case from the beginning. The parties, even now, disagree about the willingness of the Puyallups to observe sound conservation practices. Compare Brief for Respondent, 17-18 with Brief for Petitioners 11-12. The Puyallups apparently now carry on their off-reservation salmon net fishery under the supervision of the Federal District Court for the Western District of Washington. United States v. Washington, 384 F.Supp. 312, 420 (1974); Brief for Petitioners, 12. District Judge Boldt in that case found that none of the fishing tribes of western Washington, including the Puyallups, have conducted their off-reservation fisheries in such a way as to endanger any species:\n\"With a single possible exception testified to by a highly interested witness . . . and not otherwise substantiated, notwithstanding three years of exhaustive trial preparation, neither Game nor Fisheries has discovered and produced any credible evidence showing any instance, remote or recent, when a definitely identified member of any plaintiff tribe exercised his off reservation treaty rights by any conduct or means detrimental to the perpetuation of any species of anadromous fish.\" 384 F.Supp., at 338 n. 26.\n\n\n5\n This decision was handed down a month and a half before the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decided in United States v. State of Washington, 496 F.2d 620 (1974), that the Puyallups' reservation continued to exist. On appeal from Judge Boldt's decision, the State challenged certain aspects of the calculation of the allocation under Art. III related to on-reservation catches, but it appears never to have asserted that it had authority to regulate the on-reservation fishery. The Court of Appeals affirmed Judge Boldt's decision in all relevant respects, 520 F.2d 676, 690 (1975), and nowhere suggested that on-reservation fishing by the Puyallups was to be treated differently from that of any other tribe. The Court of Appeals affirmed Judge Boldt's decision over a year after it found that the Puyallups' reservation had never been extinguished.\n\n\n","label":1}

Respondent, who had been sentenced before May 1, 1971, and was ineligible for parole under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d), which was repealed by the 1970 Act, sought habeas corpus in the District Court, claiming parole eligibility when one-third of his sentence had been served.

Section 1103(a) of the 1970 statute bars the Board of Parole from considering respondent for parole under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202, since parole eligibility, as a practical matter, is determined at the time of sentencing, and sentencing is a part of the concept of 'prosecution,' saved by \u00a7 1103(a), Bradley v.

The Board of Parole is also barred by the general saving clause from considering respondent for parole, since it is clear that Congress intended ineligibility for parole in \u00a7 7237(d) to be treated as part of the offender's 'punishment,' and therefore the prohibition against the offender's eligibility for parole under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202 is a 'penalty, forfeiture, or liability' under the saving clause.

The question for decision in this case is whether the parole ineligibility provision of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d) survives the repealer, so that a narcotics offender who has served more than one-third of a sentence imposed before May 1, 1971, remains ineligible for parole consideration under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202.\n\n\n2\nRespondent was convicted of narcotics offenses and, as a second offender, was sentenced before May 1, 1971, to concurrent terms of 10 years' imprisonment on each of two counts. 450 F.2d 373, 374\u2014375 (CA2 1971).3 On February 24, 1972, respondent sought habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, claiming that, since 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d) had been repealed, he should be eligible for consideration for parole under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202 when one-third of his sentence had been served. The District Court denied relief on the ground that the prohibition on parole eligibility of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d) had been preserved by \u00a7 1103(a) of the 1970 statute4 and by 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109.5 347 F.Supp. 99. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that neither \u00a7 1103(a) of the 1970 statute nor 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 continued the prohibition on eligibility for parole consideration in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d). 483 F.2d 656 (1973).6 We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appeals.7 414 U.S. 1128, 94 S.Ct. 865, 38 L.Ed.2d 752 (1973). We agree with the District Court and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n3\nBradley v. United States, 410 U.S. 605, 611, 93 S.Ct. 1151, 1156, 35 L.Ed.2d 528 (1973), expressly reserved decision of the question now before us. Bradley involved the conviction and sentencing after May 1, 1971, of offenders who committed narcotics offenses before that date. We held that sentencing is a part of the concept of 'prosecution' and therefore that the provision of \u00a7 1103(a) of the 1970 Act that '(p)rosecutions for any violation of law occurring (before May 1, 1971) shall not be affected' by the repeal of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d), barred the sentencing judge from suspending the sentences of, or granting probation to, the Bradley petitioners and also barred him from making them eligible for early parole, before they had served one-third of their sentences, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a).8 Although stating in a footnote that '(t)he decision to grant parole under (18 U.S.C.) \u00a7 4202 lies with the Board of Parole, not with the District Judge, and must be made long after sentence has been entered and the prosecution terminated,' we concluded that '(w)hether \u00a7 1103(a) or the general saving statute, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, limits that decision is a question we cannot consider in this case.' 410 U.S., at 611 n. 6, 93 S.Ct., at 1156.\n\n\n4\n* We hold that \u00a7 1103(a) bars the Board of Parole from considering respondent for parole under 18 U.S.C. s 4202. In concluding in Bradley that ineligibility for early parole under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a) was part of the 'prosecution,' we reasoned that, since a District Judge's decision to make an offender eligible for early parole is made at the time of entering a judgment of conviction, the decision was part of the sentence and therefore also part of the 'prosecution.' 410 U.S., at 611, 93 S.Ct., at 1155.\n\n\n5\nSimilarly, a pragmatic view of sentencing requires the conclusion that parole eligibility under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202 is also determined at the time of sentence. Since, under \u00a7 4202, an offender becomes eligible for parole after serving one-third of his sentence, see n. 2, supra, parole eligibility is a function of the length of the sentence fixed by the district judge. Although, of course, the precise time at which the offender becomes eligible for parole is not part of the sentence, as it is in the case of \u00a7 4208(a), it is implicit in the terms of the sentence. And because it could not be seriously argued that sentencing decisions are made without regard to the period of time a defendant must spend in prison before becoming eligible for parole, or that such decisions would not be drastically affected by a substantial change in the proportion of the sentence required to be served before becoming eligible, parole eligibility can be properly viewed as being determined\u2014and deliberately so\u2014by the sentence of the district judge. Eligibility for parole under \u00a7 4202 is thus determined at the time of sentencing and, under the teaching of Bradley, is part of the 'prosecution' saved by \u00a7 1103(a).\n\n\n6\nWe therefore reject respondent's argument that our Bradley footnote should be read as holding that, because the decision to grant parole under \u00a7 4202 is for the Board of Parole, not the trial judge, and is arrived at after the sentence has been entered and the prosecution has come to an end, the parole eligibility decision is not part of the 'prosecution' for purposes of \u00a7 1103(a). Apart from the obvious answer that the Court could not reasonably be thought to have decided in a footnote a question 'on which' we said in the text, 'we express no opinion,' 410 U.S., at 611, 93 S.Ct., at 1156, respondent's reliance upon the footnote both proves too little and too much. It proves too little, because the fact that the Board of Parole, not the sentencing judge, finally determines whether and when an offender should be released on parole does not undercut our conclusion that the district judge, at the time of sentencing, determines when the offender will become eligible for consideration for parole and the Board's action simply implements that determination.9 It proves too much, because, if\u2014as the respondent would have it\u2014the proper focus is upon the time at which release on parole is actually granted or denied, the parole decision, whether made under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a) or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202, is made long after the 'prosecution' terminates; for under both provisions, the Board of Parole ultimately decides whether and when the offender is to be released. But, as previously mentioned, we held in Bradley that the district judge's decision to deny early parole under \u00a7 4208(a) was part of the sentence, and therefore part of the 'prosecution.'\n\nII\n\n7\nWe hold further that the general saving clause, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, also bars the Board of Parole from considering respondent for parole.10\n\n\n8\nCongress enacted its first general saving provision, c. 71, 16 Stat. 432 (1871), to abolish the common-law presumption that the repeal of a criminal statute resulted in the abatement of 'all prosecutions which had not reached final disposition in the highest court authorized to review them.' Bradley v. United States, 410 U.S., at 607, 93 S.Ct., at 1154; see Bell v. Maryland, 378 U.S. 226, 230, 84 S.Ct. 1814, 1817, 12 L.Ed.2d 822 (1964). Common-law abatements resulted not only from unequivocal statutory repeals, but also from repeals and re-enactments with different penalties, whether the re-enacted legislation increased or decreased the penalties. See Bradley v. United States, supra, 410 U.S., at 607\u2014608, 93 S.Ct., at 1153\u20141154; Lindzey v. State, 65 Miss. 542, 5 So. 99, (1888); Hartung v. People, 22 N.Y. 95 (1860); Comment, Today's Law and Yesterday's Crime: Retroactive Application of Ameliorative Criminal Legislation, 121 U.Pa.L.Rev. 120, 121\u2014126 (1972). To avoid such abatements\u2014often the product of legislative inadvertence\u2014Congress enacted 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, the general saving clause, which provides in pertinent part that '(t)he repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under such statute.' See n. 5, supra. The determinative question is thus whether the prohibition of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d) against the offender's eligibility for parole under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202 is a 'penalty, forfeiture, or liability' saved from release or extinguishment by 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109.11\n\n\n9\nUnited States v. Reisinger, 128 U.S. 398, 9 S.Ct. 99, 32 L.Ed. 480 (1888), held that the saving clause's use of the words 'penalty,' 'liability,' and 'forfeiture' required the conclusion that the clause covered criminal statutes. Those words, the Court found, were 'used by the great masters of crown law and the elementary writers as synonymous with the word 'punishment,' in connection with crimes of the highest grade.' Id., at 402, 9 S.Ct., at 101. Thus, the Court agreed with the construction of the clause by Mr. Justice Miller, as Circuit Justice, in United States v. Ulrici, 28 Fed.Cas. pp. 328, 329 (No. 16,594) (CCED Mo.1875), that those terms 'were used by Congress to include all forms of punishment for crime.' See 128 U.S., at 402\u2014403, 9 S.Ct., at 100 101. In consequence, the saving clause has been held to bar application of ameliorative criminal sentencing laws repealing harsher ones in force at the time of the commission of an offense. See, e.g., Jones v. United States, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 169, 327 F.2d 867 (1963); United States v. Kirby, 176 F.2d 101 (CA2 1949); Lovely v. United States, 175 F.2d 312 (CA4 1949).\n\n\n10\nAlthough the general saving clause does not ordinarily preserve discarded remedies or procedures, see Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U.S. 205, 218, 30 S.Ct. 621, 624, 54 L.Ed. 1001 (1910); United States v. Obermeier, 186 F.2d 243, 253 (CA2 1950), the legislative history of \u00a7 7237(d) reveals that Congress meant ineligibility for parole to be treated as part of the 'punishment' for the narcotics offenses for which respondent was convicted. Section 7237(d) was enacted as part of the Narcotic Control Act of 1956. The statute embodied congressional acceptance of the approach that effective combat against the contagion of drug addiction required the imposition of severe penalties for certain narcotics offenses. Congres therefore enacted lengthy mandatory minimum sentences as a means of decreasing both drug addiction and trafficking. See, e.g., S.Rep.No.1997, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., 5 (1956); H.R.Rep.No.2388, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., 10 (1956). But Congress believed that longer sentences would not achieve the desired results unless the offender remained imprisoned for his full term.\n\n\n11\n'In evaluating the effectiveness of the presently prescribed      penalties, it must be recognized that special incentives in      our penal system serve to decrease the actual time spent in a      penal institution under a sentence imposed by a court. The      violator is eligible for parole after serving one-third of      his sentence. . . . Available data from the Bureau of      Prisons, indicates that a narcotics violator actually serves      an average of less than two-thirds of the sentence imposed by      the court. This mitigation of sentence tends to defeat the      purposes of (existing legislation) . ...' Id., at 10\u201411, 1956      U.S.Code Cong. & Admin. News, p. 3284.\n\n\n12\nAccordingly, Congress expressly provided in \u00a7 7237(d) that parole under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202 would be unavailable for narcotics offenders.\n\n\n13\nThere are additional reasons for believing that the no-parole provision is an element of respondent's 'punishment.' First, only an unusual prisoner could be expected to think that he was not suffering a penalty when he was denied eligibility for parole. See United States v. Ross, 464 F.2d 376, 379 (CA2 1972); United States v. De Simone, 468 F.2d 1196, 1199 (CA2 1972). For the confined prisoner, parole\u2014even with its legal constraints\u2014is a long step toward regaining lost freedom.12 An observation made in somewhat different context is apt:\n\n\n14\n'It may be 'legislative grace' for Congress to provide for      parole but when it expressly removes all hope of parole upon      conviction and sentence for certain offences, . . . this is      in the nature of an additional penalty.' Durant v. United      States, 410 F.2d 689, 691 (CA5 1969).\n\n\n15\nSecond, a repealer of parole eligibility previously available to imprisoned offenders would clearly present the serious question under the ex post facto clause of Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 3, of the Constitution, of whether it imposed a 'greater or more severe punishment than was prescribed by law at the time of the . . . offense,' Rooney v. North Dakota, 196 U.S. 319, 325, 25 S.Ct. 264, 265, 49 L.Ed. 494 (1905) (emphasis added). See Love v. Fitzharris, 460 F.2d 382 (CA9 1972); cf. Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U.S. 397, 57 S.Ct. 797, 81 L.Ed. 1182 (1937); Holden v. Minnesota, 137 U.S. 483, 491\u2014492, 11 S.Ct. 143, 146, 34 L.Ed. 734 (1890); Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798); United States ex rel. Umbenhowar v. McDonnell, 11 F.Supp. 1014 (ND Ill.1934).\n\n\n16\nThus, at least where, as in the case of respondent's narcotics offenses, Congress has barred parole eligibility as a punitive measure, we hold that the noparole provision of \u00a7 7237(d) is a 'penalty, forfeiture, or liability' saved by \u00a7 109.\n\nIII\n\n17\nRespondent emphasizes that Congress completely changed its approach to regulation of narcotics offenses in the 1970 Act, jettisoning the retributive approach of the 1956 law in favor of emphasis in the 1970 Act upon rehabilitation of the narcotics offender. He argues that, in light of this basic change, little purpose is served by denying respondent eligibility for parole, indeed that such denial frustrates the current congressional goal of rehabilitating narcotics offenders.\n\n\n18\nUndeniably this argument has force, but it is addressed to the wrong governmental branch. Punishment for federal crimes is a matter for Congress, subject to judicial veto only when the legislative judgment oversteps constitutional bounds. See Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386, 393, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 1284, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958); Bell v. United States, 349 U.S. 81, 82, 75 S.Ct. 620, 621, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955). Section 1103(a) of the 1970 Act and 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 saved from repeal the bar of parole eligibility under \u00a7 7237(d), and, however severe the consequences for respondent, Congress trespassed no constitutional limits.\n\n\n19\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\n\n\n20\nReversed.\n\n\n21\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting.\n\n\n22\nThe Court holds that the no-parole provision of the repealed statute, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d) (1964 ed., and Supp. V), is saved by both the general saving clause, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109, and the specific saving clause, \u00a7 1103(a), of the 1970 Act. I believe that neither provision can be read to cover postsentencing parole eligibility and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n\n23\n* Section 109. Parole eligibility, in my view, is not a 'penalty' envisioned by, and within the meaning of, the general saving statute, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109. The purpose and thrust of \u00a7 109, the pertinent portion of which was enacted originally in 1871, c. 71, 16 Stat. 432, is to preclude the technical abatement of a prosecution for an offense that was committed before the criminal statute was repealed. Hamm v. Rock Hill, 379 U.S. 306, 314, 85 S.Ct. 384, 390, 13 L.Ed.2d 300 (1964). Quite appropriately, this recognizes that, apart from exceptional circumstances,1 one who violates the criminal law should not escape sanction if, subsequent to the commission of his criminal act, the law happens to be repealed.\n\n\n24\nThis saving statute, however, is not in line with the traditional common-law rule favoring application of existing law. United States v. Chambers, 291 U.S. 217, 54 S.Ct. 434, 78 L.Ed. 763 (1934); United States v. Tynen, 11 Wall. 88, 20 L.Ed. 153 (1871). See United States v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103, 2 L.Ed. 49 (1801); Bradley v. School Board of City of Richmond, 416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974). The statute has never been applied by this Court other than to prevent technical abatement of a prosecution.2 Those federal courts that have interpreted the statute's reference to 'penalty' to include the terms of the sentence have dealt only with the length of the sentence actually imposed. United States v. Kirby, 176 F.2d 101 (CA2 1949); Lovely v. United States, 175 F.2d 312 (CA4), cert. denied, 338 U.S. 834, 70 S.Ct. 38, 94 L.Ed. 508 (1949); Duffel v. United States, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 242, 221 F.2d 523 (1954); Maceo v. United States, 46 F.2d 788 (CA5 1931).3\n\n\n25\nIn this case, however, we are faced with a decidedly different situation. Respondent Marrero in no way is seeking to avoid punishment for his criminal act, and he is still fully subject to the service of his sentence. What Marrero seeks is merely the opportunity to be considered for parole. Eligibility for parole will not free him from his imposed sentence. The decision whether he should be accorded parole lies within the discretion of the Board of Parole. If for any reason the Board feels that parole would not be appropriate for the respondent, it can be denied, and Marrero will remain incarcerated for the term to which he is subject. Moreover, even if parole is deemed appropriate and is granted, respondent still would be subject to the conditions the parole authorities choose to place on his conditional freedom.\n\n\n26\nAs the Fourth Circuit aptly has observed, parole 'is not a release of the prisoner from all disciplinary restraint, but is rather merely 'an extension of the prison walls'; and the prisoner while on parole remains 'in the legal custody and under the control of' the Parole Board,' United States ex rel. Rowe v. Nicholson, 4 Cir., 78 F.2d 468, 469\u2014470, cert. denied, 296 U.S. 573, 56 S.Ct. 118, 80 L.Ed. 405 (1935); Alvarado v. McLaughlin, 486 F.2d 541, 544 (4 Cir. 1973). See also United States v. Marshall, 158 U.S.App.D.C. 283, 286, 485 F.2d 1062, 1065 (1973). The 'sentence' to be served by respondent is still 10 years, whether or not he is granted parole. Cf. Anderson v. Corall, 263 U.S. 193, 44 S.Ct. 43, 68 L.Ed. 247 (1923). In short, it is by no means clear to me that respondent Marrero is seeking to be relieved of the obligations of the 'sentence' imposed upon him.\n\n\n27\nBy expanding the term 'penalty' to include parole ineligibility, rather than restricting it to the sentence imposed, the Court, in my view, misconceives the nature of parole ineligibility and extends \u00a7 109 well beyond its prior limits. To say that Congress intended parole ineligibility to be a 'penalty' under the repealed statute is merely to state the conclusion. The appropriate question is whether Congress intended parole ineligibility to be the type of 'penalty' preserved by the general saving statute. Until today, \u00a7 109 has not been read so broadly, and I believe this extension goes beyond the intended narrow anti-abatement reach of \u00a7 109. To repeat: \u00a7 109 'was meant to obviate mere technical abatement.' Hamm v. Rock Hill, 379 U.S., at 314, 85 S.Ct., at 390.\n\n\n28\nThis unprecedented extension of \u00a7 109 might be justified, and perhaps made acceptable, if it were possible in any way to conclude that the Court's reading serves to effectuate congressional intent or to promote some valid policy. But the result reached clearly does a disservice in both respects.\n\n\n29\nAs is demonstrated in Part II, infra, Congress did not affirmatively intend to save the no-parole provision. And on pure policy grounds, the result reached by the Court is wholly illogical. Presumably, the purposes behind parole ineligibility are to effect a deterrence to the commission of narcotics offenses, and to keep serious drug offenders behind bars for longer periods. By repealing the parole ineligibility provision, Congress rejected any deterrence rationale that had existed. A person who, on or subsequent to May 1, 1971, might anticipate the commission of a drug offense and who is cognizant of the law, knows that he is eligible for parole under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202 after service of one-third of his more-than-180-day sentence. The anomalous effect of the Court's action is that it keeps an inmate who is convicted of an offense committed on April 30, 1971, incarcerated for the full length of his term, while his fellow inmate who committed the identical crime on May 2 and who behaved identically in prison, is eligible for release after one-third the time. Surely, disparate treatment of this kind serves only to frustrate the inmate's sense of justice and to undermine whatever rehabilitative attempts currently are being made.4\n\nII\n\n30\nSection 1103(a). In passing the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1236, with its specific repealer provisions in \u00a7\u00a7 1101(b)(3)(A) and (b)(4)(A), Congress unequivocally withdrew and rejected the concept of parole ineligibility. It concluded that the criminal process is ill served by a law that removes the incentives and the rehabilitative potential of a parole system. The only reference in the 1970 Act to pre-Act offenders is in the saving provision of \u00a7 1103(a), 84 Stat. 1294, and it precludes abatement only of 'prosecutions.' Although we pretermitted this precise question in Bradley v. United States, 410 U.S. 605, 611 n. 6, 93 S.Ct. 1151, 1156, 35 L.Ed.2d 528 (1973), the Court clearly distinguished postsentence parole eligibility from the specific terms of the sentence already handed down. I believe this distinction is crucial and that it requires a different result in the instant situation.\n\n\n31\nIn determining whether \u00a7 1103(a) bars parole eligibility for pre-Act offenders, the Court should ascertain what Congress intended. While there is no precise legislative history on this question, I think the wording of \u00a7 1103(a) and the overall purposes of the 1970 Act preclude the result reached by the Court. Section 1103(a) applies only to 'prosecutions.' We reached the outer limit of this term in Bradley. Certainly the legislative and judicial history of the even broader language of the general saving provision, \u00a7 109, hardly supports the extravagant interpretation of \u00a7 1103(a) reached today. In light of the clear history and law under \u00a7 109, had Congress wanted to save more than the prosecution itself, it could well have done so in specific terms. Instead, it chose the narrowest possible saving clause. Particularly in light of the fact that the text of the 1970 Act specifically rejects the concept of paroleless sentencing, it is illogical and unwarranted to assume that Congress intended the term 'prosecutions' to be read so broadly.\n\n\n32\nFor me there is no ambiguity in \u00a7 1103(a). I would take the limited saving clause at its word. Assuming, arguendo, that there is some doubt as to the congressional intent, it is harsh, to say the least, to resolve the doubt in the manner chosen by the Court. In light of the general rule favoring application of existing law, United States v. Chambers, 291 U.S. 217, 54 S.Ct. 434, 78 L.Ed. 763 (1934), and the general rule favoring construction of ambiguous statutes in favor of criminal defendants, United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 92 S.Ct. 515, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971), I see no other choice than to resolve any doubts in favor of eligibility.\n\n\n33\nThe Court would justify its broad reading of the word 'prosecution' by stating that 'a pragmatic view of sentencing requires (this) conclusion.' Ante, at 658. Needless to say, no authority, legal or otherwise, is cited for this proposition other than the majority's own intuition, and I venture to say that none could be cited. Parole eligibility is determined by a parole board at its discretion, and the existence of parole eligibility is either guaranteed by statute or, as in the case of the repealed Act, is denied by statute. One thing is clear: the sentencing judge has no explicit control over the determination. Congress has never instructed district courts to assess sentences according to parole eligibility dates and if in fact some judges do this, it hardly justifies this Court's flat conclusion that parole eligibility is 'implicit in the terms of the sentence' and is 'thus determined at the time of sentencing.' Ibid.\n\n\n34\nWhatever else Bradley held, it clearly stated that the parole eligibility determination under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202 (as opposed to preclusion of early parole in the terms of the sentence, as in Bradley) does not lie with the district judge, and the determination is 'made long after sentence has been entered and the prosecution terminated.' 410 U.S., at 611 n. 6, 93 S.Ct., at 1156 (emphasis added).5 Even assuming footnote 6 in Bradley did not conclusively decide the instant issue, the Court's opinion renders the words of the footnote a nullity. The majority states that we 'could not reasonably be thought to have decided in a footnote a question 'on which' we said in the text, 'we express no opinion,\" ante, at 659. It then goes on to decide that very issue, relying almost entirely on Bradley and concluding that 'under the teaching of Bradley' ineligibility for parole 'is part of the 'prosecution.\" Ante, at 658. At the least, Bradley precludes the approach taken by the majority. To my mind, it precludes the result reached.\n\nIII\n\n35\nRespondent Marrero does not seek release. He seeks only to be treated in the manner Congress now has recognized as appropriate for all criminal offenders, including those convicted of narcotics violations. If a professional Board of Parole determines that parole is in the best interests of an inmate and of society, Congress has determined that the inmate should be paroled. The Court, in my view, makes a serious mistake in expanding \u00a7 109 so drastically, and in interpreting \u00a7 1103(a) contrary to its intent and language, in order to preclude this result. With only one exception,6 the federal courts of appeals that have considered this issue currently reject the Government's argument.7 Inasmuch as I believe the Government's position here is incorrect, in terms both of the laws and of policy, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n\n1\n Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d) (1964 ed. and Supp. V) provided:\n'Upon conviction\u2014\n'(1) of any offense the penalty for which is provided in subsection (b) of this section, subsection (c), (h), or (i) of section 2 of the Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act, as amended, or such Act of July 11, 1941, as amended, or\n'(2) of any offense the penalty for which is provided in subsection (a) of this section, if it is the offender's second or subsequent offense,\n'the imposition or execution of sentence shall not be suspended, probation shall not be granted, section 4202 of title 18 of the United States Code shall not apply, and the Act of July 15, 1932 (47 Stat. 696; D.C.Code 24\u2014201 and following), as amended, shall not apply.'\n\n\n2\n Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202 provides:\n'A Federal prisoner, other than a juvenile delinquent or a committed youth offender, wherever confined and serving a definite term or terms of over one hundred and eighty days, whose record shows that he has observed the rules of the institution in which he is confined, may be released on parole after serving one-third of such term or terms or after serving fifteen years of a life sentence or of a sentence of over forty-five years.'\n\n\n3\n Respondent was convicted of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 173 (1964 ed.) and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4701, 4703, 4704(a), and 4771(a) (1964 ed.). His sentences were imposed under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(a). Section 174 explicitly incorporated the provisions of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d), which was directly applicable to the sentence imposed under \u00a7 7237(a).\n\n\n4\n Section 1103(a) provides:\n'Prosecutions for any violation of law occurring prior to the effective date of (the Act) shall not be affected by the repeals or amendments made by (it) . . . or abated by reason thereof.'\n\n\n5\n Title 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 provides in relevant part:\n'The repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under such statute, unless the repealing Act shall so expressly provide, and such statute shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture, or liability.'\n\n\n6\n The mandate was issued before the Circuit Justice signed a stay. The stay was treated, however, as staying all proceedings under the mandate. Respondent's motion to dismiss the writ of certiorari as moot is therefore denied.\n\n\n7\n The Courts of Appeals for the Second and Tenth Circuits have held that narcotics offenders are ineligible for parole. United States v. De Simone, 468 F.2d 1196 (CA2 1972) (but see United States v. Huguet, 481 F.2d 888 (CA2 1973)); Perea v. United States Board of Parole, 480 F.2d 608 (CA10 1973). In addition to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in this case, the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, and District of Columbia Circuits have held that narcotics offenders are eligible for parole. See Alvarado v. McLaughlin, 486 F.2d 541 (CA4 1973); Amaya v. United States Board of Parole, 486 F.2d 940 (CA5 1973); United States v. McGarr, 461 F.2d 1 (CA7 1972); United States v. Marshall, 158 U.S.App.D.C. 283, 485 F.2d 1062 (1973).\n\n\n8\n Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a) provides:\n'(a) Upon entering a judgment of conviction, the court having jurisdiction to impose sentence, when in its opinion the ends of justice and best interests of the public require that the defendant be sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, may (1) designate in the sentence of imprisonment imposed a minimum term at the expiration of which the prisoner shall become eligible for parole, which term may be less than, but shall not be more than one-third of the maximum sentence imposed by the court, or (2) the court may fix the maximum sentence of imprisonment to be served in which event the court may specify that the prisoner may become eligible for parole at such time as the board of parole may determine.'\n\n\n9\n The statement in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 480, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972), that '(p)arole arises after the end of the criminal prosecution, including imposition of sentence' was addressed to the decision determining the time of release on parole as distinguished from the decision determining eligibility.\n\n\n10\n Respondent argues that, since the 1970 Act contains its own saving clause, \u00a7 1103(a), that specific directive should be read to supersede the general clause \u00a7 109. But only if \u00a7 1103(a) can be said by fair implication or expressly to conflict with \u00a7 109 would there be reason to hold that \u00a7 1103(a) superseded \u00a7 109. See Great Northern R. Co. v. United States, 208 U.S. 452, 465\u2014466, 28 S.Ct. 313, 316\u2014317, 52 L.Ed. 567 (1908). We find no conflict.\n\n\n11\n The Court of Appeals, relying on statements in opinions of this Court that \u00a7 109 is intended to obviate 'mere technical abatement(s),' see Hamm v. Rock Hill, 379 U.S. 306, 314, 85 S.Ct. 384, 390, 13 L.Ed.2d 300 (1964), held that, since respondent's conviction and sentence would remain intact even if he were released on parole, the purposes of 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 would not be served by applying it to save the no-parole provision of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d). 483 F.2d 656, 663; see United States v. Stephens, 449 F.2d 103, 105\u2014106 (CA9 1971). This analysis, it seems to us, begs the relevant question. The no-parole provision of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d) was directly incorporated into the sentencing provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(a), see n. 3, supra, and if the repeal of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d) can be viewed as mitigating respondent's punishment under those sections, his conviction and sentence would not be left intact by the repealer and his prosecution would 'technically' abate under the common-law rule. Thus, the appropriate inquiry is whether parole ineligibility is a 'penalty, forfeiture, or liability' for his offense that survives the repealer.\n\n\n12\n In Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S., at 482, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484, in determining that parole may not be revoked without affording the parolee procedural due process, we observed:\n'The liberty of a parole enables him to do a wide range of things open to persons who have never been convicted of any crime. . . . Subject to the conditions of his parole, he can be gainfully employed and is free to be with family and friends and to form the other enduring attachments of normal life. Though the State properly subjects him to many restrictions not applicable to other citizens, his condition is very different from that of confinement in a prison.' (Footnote omitted.)\n\n\n1\n See, e.g., Hamm v. Rock Hill, 379 U.S. 306, 85 S.Ct. 384, 13 L.Ed.2d 300 (1964).\n\n\n2\n The issue certified and decided in United States v. Reisinger, 128 U.S. 398, 9 S.Ct. 99, 32 L.Ed. 480 (1888), was only whether a prosecution under a repealed criminal statute survived the repeal. 'Penalty' appears to have been used there interchangeably with the concept of criminal liability. See also United States v. Smith, 433 F.2d 341 (CA4 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 942, 91 S.Ct. 949, 28 L.Ed.2d 223 (1971); United States v. Brown, 429 F.2d 566 (CA5 1970); Faubion v. United States, 424 F.2d 437 (CA10 1970).\n\n\n3\n In Kirby and Lovely the Courts of Appeals construed the general saving clause in connection with repealing statutes' saving clauses that provided for the nonabatement of any 'rights and liabilities' under the repealed acts. It is interesting to note that all the cases cited by the Court, ante, at 661, and petitioner, Brief for Petitioner 16\u201417, for the proposition that sentence as well as prosecution survives under the general saving clause, were decided in circuits that subsequently rejected the extension sought by petitioner in the present case.\n\n\n4\n Petitioner concedes that granting parole eligibility presents no institutional problems.\n'Neither the Bureau of Prisons nor the Board of Parole believes that it would impede the proper performance of their functions if they were required to consider narcotics offenders convicted under the prior statute eligible for parole under 18 U.S.C. 4202. Such a requirement would not demand the granting of parole to any individual prisoner unless the Board determines that his supervised release from confinement is in the interests of both the prisoner and society.' Brief for Petitioner 8.\n\n\n5\n As the Court notes, ante, at 659, n. 9, in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 480, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972), we stated that '(P)arole arises after the end of the criminal prosecution, including imposition of (the) sentence.' The fact that the decision might have dealt with release rather than the determination of eligibility does not eliminate the conceptual proposition that parole eligibility is an event separate from sentencing, and I feel that the majority's attempted distinction is not persuasive.\n\n\n6\n Perea v. United States Board of Parole, 480 F.2d 608 (CA10 1973).\n\n\n7\n United States ex rel. Marrero v. Warden, 483 F.2d 656 (CA3 1973) (the instant case); Alvarado v. McLaughlin, 486 F.2d 541 (CA4 1973), pet. for cert. pending sub nom. McLaughlin v. Prieto; Amaya v. United States Board of Parole, 486 F.2d 940 (CA5 1973), pet. for cert. pending; United States v.

Cummings, Jr., Solicitor General of the United States, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nMr. Paul Harkey, Idabel, Okl., for respondent.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nIn this proceeding, the Government sought the forfeiture of an automobile and of a truck under the provisions of \u00a7 3116 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3116, in the District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma. That Section allows the seizure and forfeiture of property 'intended for use in violating' the alcohol tax laws, as well as property 'which has been so used'. The respondent, alleging an interest in the two vehicles, contested the forfeitures.\n\n\n2\nThe district judge found the facts to be that the truck and automobile had each been used by the operator of an illegal distillery to drive a number of miles from his home and then parked at a point one-half mile or more from the distillery, the operator walking the rest of the way. The district judge found that the Government had not shown, as it had been alleged, that the vehicles had been used for transporting materials or utensils for use at the distillery, and ruled that the facts shown did not justify a forfeiture. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed, 199 F.2d 495.\n\n\n3\nThe Government has petitioned for a writ of certiorari showing that, while the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in United States v. One 1948 Plymouth Sedan, 1952, 198 F.2d 399, held in accord with the Tenth Circuit, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has taken a contrary view, United States v.

Porter, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nMr. Robert S. Erdahl, for respondent.\nMr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nIn May 1950, petitioner was indicted in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri for purchasing and possessing one grain of heroin. Claiming that the heroin capsule had been obtained through an unlawful search and seizure, petitioner moved to suppress it. The motion was granted, and shortly thereafter, on the Government's motion, the case against petitioner was dismissed.\n\n\n2\nIn January of 1952, petitioner was again indicted, this time for four other illicit transactions in narcotics. The Government's case consisted principally of the testimony of two drug addicts who claimed to have procured the illicit stuff from petitioner under the direction of federal agents. The only witness for the defense was the defendant himself, petitioner here. He denied any narcotics dealings with the two Government informers and attributed the testimony against him to personal hostility.\n\n\n3\nEarly on his direct examination petitioner testified as follows:\n\n\n4\n'Q. Now, first, Mr. Walder, before we go further in your      testimony, I want to you (sic) tell the Court and jury      whether, not referring to these informers in this case, but      whether you have ever sold any narcotics to anyone. A. I have      never sold any narcotics to anyone in my life.\n\n\n5\n'Q. Have you ever had any narcotics in your possession, other      than what may have been given to you by a physician for an      ailment? A. No.\n\n\n6\n'Q. Now, I will ask you one more thing. Have you ever handed      or given any narcotics to anyone as a gift or in any other      manner without the receipt of any money or any other      compensation? A. I have not.\n\n\n7\n'Q. Have you ever even acted as, say, have you acted as a      conduit for the purpose of handling what you knew to be a      narcotic from one person to another? A. No, Sir.' On cross-examination, in response to a question by Government counsel making reference to this direct testimony, petitioner reiterated his assertion that he had never purchased, sold or possessed any narcotics. Over the defendant's objection, the Government then questioned him about the heroin capsule unlawfully seized from his home in his presence back in February 1950. The defendant stoutly denied that any narcotics were taken from him at that time.1 The Government then put on the stand one of the officers who had participated in the unlawful search and seizure and also the chemist who had analyzed the heroin capsule there seized. The trial judge admitted this evidence, but carefully charged the jury that it was not to be used to determine whether the defendant had committed the crimes here charged, but solely for the purpose of impeaching the defendant's credibility. The defendant was convicted and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, one judge dissenting. 201 F.2d 715. The question which divided that court, and the sole issue here, is whether the defendant's assertion on direct examination that he had never possessed any narcotics opened the door, solely for the purpose of attacking the defendant's credibility, to evidence of the heroin unlawfully seized in connection with the earlier proceeding. Because this question presents a novel aspect of the scope of the doctrine of Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652, we granted certiorari. 345 U.S. 992, 73 S.Ct. 1144.\n\n\n8\nThe Government cannot violate the Fourth Amendment2\u2014in the only way in which the Government can do anything, namely through its agents\u2014and use the fruits of such unlawful conduct to secure a conviction. Weeks v. United States, supra. Nor can the Government make indirect use of such evidence for its case, Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U.S. 385, 40 S.Ct. 182, 64 L.Ed. 319, or support a conviction on evidence obtained through leads from the unlawfully obtained evidence, cf. Nardone v. United States, 308 U.S. 338, 60 S.Ct. 266, 84 L.Ed. 307. All these methods are outlawed, and convictions obtained by means of them are invalidated, because they encourage the kind of society that is obnoxious to free men.\n\n\n9\nIt is one thing to say that the Government cannot make an affirmative use of evidence unlawfully obtained. It is quite another to say that the defendant can turn the illegal method by which evidence in the Government's possession was obtained to his own advantage, and provide himself with a shield against contradiction of his untruths. Such an extension of the Weeks doctrine would be a perversion of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n\n10\nTake the present situation. Of his own accord, the defendant went beyond a mere denial of complicity in the crimes of which he was charged and made the sweeping claim that he had never dealt in or possessed any narcotics. Of course, the Constitution guarantees a defendant the fullest opportunity to meet the accusation against him. He must be free to deny all the elements of the case against him without thereby giving leave to the Government to introduce by way of rebuttal evidence illegally secured by it, and therefore not available for its case in chief. Beyond that, however, there is hardly justification for letting the defendant affirmatively resort to perjurious testimony in reliance on the Government's disability to challenge his credibility.3\n\n\n11\nThe situation here involved is to be sharply contrasted with that presented by Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20, 46 S.Ct. 4, 70 L.Ed. 145. There the Government, after having failed in its efforts to introduce the tainted evidence in its case in chief, tried to smuggle it in on cross-examinaton by asking the accused the broad question 'Did you ever see narcotics before?'4 After eliciting the expected denial, it sought to introduce evidence of narcotics located in the defendant's home by means of an unlawful search and seizure, in order to discredit the defendant. In holding that the Government could no more work in this evidence on cross-examination than it could in its case in chief, the Court foreshadowed, perhaps unwittingly, the result we reach today:\n\n\n12\n'And the contention that the evidence of the search and      seizure was admissible in rebuttal is without merit. In his      direct examination, Agnello was not asked and did not testify      concerning the can of cocaine. In cross-examination, in      answer to a question permitted over his objection, he said he      had never seen it. He did nothing to waive his constitutional      protection or to justify cross-examination in respect of the      evidence claimed to have been obtained by the search. * * *'      269 U.S. at page 35, 46 S.Ct. at page 7.\n\n\n13\nThe judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n14\nAffirmed.\n\n\n15\nMr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n This denial squarely contradicted the affidavit filed by the defendant in the earlier proceeding, in connection with his motion under Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. rule 41(e), 18 U.S.C.A. to suppress the evidence unlawfully seized.\n\n\n2\n 'The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated * * *.'\n\n\n3\n Cf. Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 479, 69 S.Ct. 213, 220, 93 L.Ed. 168: 'The price a defendant must pay for attempting to prove his good name is to throw open the entire subject which the law has kept closed for his benefit and to make himself vulnerable where the law otherwise shields him.'\nThe underlying rationale of the Michelson case also disposes of the evidentiary question raised by petitioner, to wit, 'whether defendant's actual guilt under a former indictment which was dismissed may be proved by extrinsic evidence introduced to impeach him in a prosecution for a subsequent offense.'\n\n\n4\n Transcript of Record, p. 476, Agnello v.

{"text":"396 U.S. 41\n90 S.Ct. 206\n24 L.Ed.2d 209\nPaul M. BROCKINGTON, Appellant,v.James A. RHODES, Governor of Ohio, et al.\nNo. 31.\nArgued Oct. 22, 1969.\n\nMandamus proceeding to compel Governor of Ohio and others to place plaintiff's name on ballot for November, 1968 election as an independent candidate for United States House of Representatives from a particular district. The Court of Common Pleas denied writ of mandamus, and appeal was taken. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Judicial District affirmed the judgment, and appeal was taken. The Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed the appeal for want of a substantial constitutional question, and plaintiff appealed. The Supreme Court held that case was moot because congressional election was over.\nJudgment of Supreme Court of Ohio vacated and cause remanded for such proceedings as that court might deem appropriate.\nBenjamin Sheerer, Cleveland, Ohio, for appellant.\nRobert D. Macklin, Columbus, Ohio, for appellees.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nThe appellant sought to run in the November 1968 election as an independent candidate for the United States House of Representatives from the Twenty-first Congressional District of Ohio. His nominating petition bore the signatures of 899 voters in the congressional district, a little over 1% of those in the district who had voted in the gubernatorial contest at the last election. The Board of Elections ruled that the appellant's petition was insufficient to put his name on the November ballot, because it did not contain the signatures of 7% of the qualified voters, as Ohio law then required.1 The appellant petitioned the Court of Common Pleas for a writ of mandamus, challenging the 7% requirement as 'unreasonably high and excessive, * * * disproportionate when compared to the 100 signatures required for party candidates,2 * * * arbitrary and capricious, * * * [and] an invidious discrimination without any relationship to constitutionally justified ends * * *.' He urged as the proper standard for determining the sufficiency of his nominating petition the 1% requirement that had prevailed for over 60 years until the enactment of the 7% rule in 1952. He prayed for an immediate order restraining the Board of Elections from printing the election ballots; also for a writ of mandamus commanding the Board 'to certify the sufficiency of relator's nominating petition' and directing the appellees 'to do all things necessary to place relator's name upon the ballot as an independent candidate for United States House of Representatives from the Ohio Twenty-First Congressional District in the November 5, 1968, general election * * *.' His suit did not purport to be a class action, and he sought no declaratory relief.\n\n\n2\nOn August 22, 1968, the Court of Common Pleas denied the writ of mandamus. On October 1 the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Judicial District affirmed that judgment, and on October 23 the Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed the appeal for want of a substantial constitutional question. The appellant then appealed to this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257, and we noted probable jurisdiction, 393 U.S. 1078, 89 S.Ct. 877, 21 L.Ed.2d 771. While the appeal was pending here, Ohio amended the controlling statute, effective October 30, 1969, reducing the signature requirement from 7% to 4%.\n\n\n3\nWe do not think the recent statutory amendment has rendered this case moot. For the appellant has consistently urged the unconstitutionality of any percentage requirement in excess of the 1% that Ohio imposed prior to 1952, and he obtained the signatures of only about 1% of the voters in his district. He thus could not have won a place on the ballot even under the statute as currently written. Cf. Hall v. Beals, 396 U.S. 45, 90 S.Ct. 200, 24 L.Ed.2d 214.\n\n\n4\nRather, in view of the limited nature of the relief sought, we think the case is moot because the congressional election is over. The appellant did not allege that he intended to run for office in any future elections. He did not attempt to maintain a class action on behalf of himself and other putative independent candidates, present or future. He did not sue for himself and others similarly situated as independent voters, as he might have under Ohio law. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 2307.21 (1953). He did not seek a declaratory judgment, although that avenue too was open to him. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2721.01-2721.15 (1953).\n\n\n5\nInstead, he sought only a writ of mandamus to compel the appellees to place his name on the ballot as a candidate for a particular office in a particular election on November 5, 1968. In Ohio mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, available to a petitioner only on a showing of clear legal right. State ex rel. Gerspacher v. Coffinberry, 157 Ohio St. 32, 104 N.E.2d 1; State ex rel. Stanley v. Cook, 146 Ohio St. 348, 66 N.E.2d 207. The writ does not lie to review the determination by a Board of Elections that a candidate is ineligible to assume the office he seeks or that his petition is invalid, in the absence of allegations of fraud, corruption, abuse of discretion, or a clear disregard of statutes or applicable legal principles. State ex rel. Flynn v. Board of Elections, 164 Ohio St. 193, 129 N.E.2d 623; cf. State ex rel. Hanna v. Milburn, 170 Ohio St. 9, 11, 161 N.E.2d 891, 893. In the instant suit the Court of Common Pleas ruled that the appellant 'must not only establish that the act which he seeks to compel respondents to perform is one that they are constitutionally bound to perform by virtue of their offices, but also that he, the relator, has a clear right to have the duty enforced.' The court, without passing on the merits of the legal issues raised by the parties, found that the appellant had not established a clear legal right to the writ on the basis of all the evidence.\n\n\n6\nIt is now impossible to grant the appellant the limited, extraordinary relief he sought in the Ohio courts. Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio must be vacated, without costs in this Court, and the cause remanded for such proceedings as that court may deem appropriate.\n\n\n7\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n8\nJudgment vacated and cause remanded.\n\n\n\n1\n Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 3513.257 (Supp.1968) provided in pertinent part:\n'The nominating petition of an independent candidate for the office of * * * district representative to congress, shall be signed by not less than seven per cent of the number of electors who voted for governor at the next preceding regular state election for the office of governor in the district.'\n\n\n2\n Under Ohio law a candidate for the nomination of a political party to the office of United States Representative must, in order to enter the party primary, obtain from the party membership within the congressional district the signatures of either 100 voters or 5% of those who voted in the last gubernatorial election, whichever is less.

EUGE.\nNo. 78-1453.\nArgued Nov. 26, 1979.\nDecided Feb. 20, 1980.\nRehearing Denied April 21, 1980.\n\nSee 446 U.S. 913, 100 S.Ct. 1845.\n\nSyllabus\n\nSection 7602 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 authorizes the Internal Revenue Service to summon individuals to \"appear,\" and \"to produce such books, papers, records, or other data, and to give such testimony,\" as may be relevant to a tax investigation. During an investigation of respondent's income tax liability, in an effort to determine whether deposits in certain bank accounts not registered in respondent's name represented income attributable to him, an IRS agent issued a summons requiring respondent to appear and execute handwriting exemplars of the various signatures appearing on the bank signature cards.  When respondent refused to comply with the summons, the United States brought suit to enforce it.  The District Court held that the summons should be enforced, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the summons authority under \u00a7 7602 does not authorize the IRS to compel the execution of handwriting exemplars.\nHeld :  The IRS is empowered to compel handwriting exemplars under its summons authority conferred by \u00a7 7602.  Pp. 710-719.\n(a) While \u00a7 7602's language may not be explicit in authorizing handwriting exemplars, the duty to appear and give testimony has traditionally encompassed a duty to provide some forms of nontestimonial, physical evidence, including handwriting exemplars.  By imposing an obligation to produce documents as well as to appear and give testimony, \u00a7 7602's language suggests an intention to codify a broad testimonial obligation, including an obligation to provide some physical evidence relevant and material to a tax investigation.  From this authority to compel the production of some physical evidence, it can properly be concluded that the authority extends to the execution of handwriting exemplars, one variety of physical evidence.  Pp. 712-714.\n(b) This Court has consistently construed congressional intent to require that if the claimed summons authority is necessary for the effective performance of congressionally imposed responsibilities to enforce the Internal Revenue Code, that authority should be upheld absent express statutory prohibition or substantial countervailing congressional policies.  Pp. 714-716. (c) The authority claimed here is necessary for the effective exercise of the IRS's enforcement responsibilities.  Handwriting exemplars are often an important evidentiary component in establishing tax liability, the use of such exemplars being an effective method for determining whether a particular name is an alias of a taxpayer.  Pp. 716-717.\n(d) Moreover, the authority claimed here is entirely consistent with the statutory language and is not in derogation of any countervailing policies or any constitutional rights, compulsion of handwriting exemplars being neither a search or seizure subject to Fourth Amendment protections nor testimonial evidence protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  Pp. 717-718.\n8 Cir., 587 F.2d 25, reversed.\nStuart A. Smith, Washington, D. C., for petitioners.\nJames W. Erwin, St. Louis, Mo., for respondent.\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe United States sued in the District Court seeking enforcement of an Internal Revenue Service summons requiring respondent to appear and provide handwriting exemplars. Enforcement was denied by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, 587 F.2d 25 (1978) (en banc), and we granted certiorari.1 441 U.S. 942, 99 S.Ct. 2159, 60 L.Ed.2d 1044.  We now hold that Congress has empowered the IRS to compel handwriting exemplars under its summons authority conferred by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602.\n\n\n2\n* The facts are not in dispute.  In October 1977, an agent in the Intelligence Division of the Internal Revenue Service was assigned to investigate respondent's income tax liability for the years 1973 through 1976.  Respondent had not filed any tax returns for those years.  The Service sought to employ the \"bank deposits method\" of reconstructing respondent's income for those years, as a means of calculating his tax liability.  Under this method of proof, the sums deposited in the taxpayer's bank accounts are scrutinized to determine whether they represent taxable income.\n\n\n3\nDuring the course of the investigation, the agent found only two bank accounts registered in respondent's name.  Twenty other bank accounts were discovered, however, which the agent had reason to believe were being maintained by respondent under aliases to conceal taxable income.  The statements for these accounts were sent to post office boxes held in respondent's name;  the signature cards for the accounts listed addresses of properties owned by respondent;  and the agent had documented frequent transfers of funds between the accounts.\n\n\n4\nIn an effort to determine whether the sums deposited in these accounts represented income attributable to respondent, the agent issued a summons on October 7, 1977, requiring respondent to appear and execute handwriting exemplars of the various signatures appearing on the bank signature cards.  Respondent declined to comply with the summons.\n\n\n5\nThe United States commenced this action under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(a).  The District Court held that the summons should be enforced, ordering respondent to provide 10 handwriting exemplars of 8 different signatures.  The Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that the summons authority vested in the Internal Revenue Service under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602 does not authorize the IRS to compel the execution of handwriting exemplars.2\n\nII\n\n6\nThe structure and history of the statutory authority of the Internal Revenue Service to summon witnesses to produce evidence necessary for tax investigations has been repeatedly reviewed by this Court in recent years.  See Reisman v. Caplin, 375 U.S. 440, 84 S.Ct. 508, 11 L.Ed.2d 459 (1964);  United States v. Powell, 379 U.S. 48, 85 S.Ct. 248, 13 L.Ed.2d 112 (1964);  Donaldson v. United States, 400 U.S. 517, 91 S.Ct. 534, 27 L.Ed.2d 580 (1971);  United States v. Bisceglia, 420 U.S. 141, 95 S.Ct. 915, 43 L.Ed.2d 88 (1975);  Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 96 S.Ct. 1569, 48 L.Ed.2d 39 (1976);  United States v. LaSalle National Bank, 437 U.S. 298, 98 S.Ct. 2357, 57 L.Ed.2d 221 (1978).  Under \u00a7 7602, the Secretary of the Treasury, and therefore the IRS as his designate,3 is authorized to summon individuals to \"appear before the Secretary  . . .  and to produce such books, papers, records, or other data, and to give testimony, under oath, as may be relevant or material to such inquiry   . . . .\"4  The question presented here is whether this power to compel a witness to \"appear,\" to produce \"other data,\" and to \"give such testimony,\" includes the power to compel the execution of handwriting exemplars.  We conclude that it does, for several reasons.  While the language may not be explicit in its authorization of handwriting exemplars, the duty to appear and give testimony, a duty imposed by \u00a7 7602, has traditionally encompassed a duty to provide some forms of nontestimonial, physical evidence, including handwriting exemplars.  Further this Court has consistently construed congressional intent to require that if the summons authority claimed is necessary for the effective performance of congressionally imposed responsibilities to enforce the tax Code, that authority should be upheld absent express statutory prohibition or substantial countervailing policies.  The authority claimed here is necessary for the effective exercise of the Service's enforcement responsibilities;  it is entirely consistent with the statutory language;  and it is not in derogation of any constitutional rights or countervailing policies enunciated by Congress.\n\n\n7\n* Through \u00a7 7602, Congress has imposed a duty on persons possessing information \"relevant or material\" to an investigation of federal tax liability to produce that information at the request of the Secretary or his delegate.  That duty to provide relevant information expressly obligates the person summoned to produce documentary evidence and to \"appear\" and \"give testimony.\" Imposition of such an evidentiary obligation is, of course, not a novel innovation attributable to \u00a7 7602.  The common law has been the source of a comparable evidentiary obligation for centuries. In determining the scope of the obligation Congress intended to impose by use of this language, we have previously analogized, as an interpretive guide, to the common-law duties attaching to the issuance of a testimonial summons.  See United States v. Bisceglia, supra, 420 U.S., at 147-148, 95 S.Ct., at 919;  United States v. Powell, supra, 379 U.S., at 57, 85 S.Ct., at 254. Congress, through legislation, may expand or contract the duty imposed,5 but absent some contrary expression, there is a wealth of history helpful in defining the duties imposed by the issuance of a summons.\n\n\n8\nThe scope of the \"testimonial\"6 or evidentiary duty imposed by common law or statute has traditionally been interpreted as an expansive duty limited principally by relevance and privilege.  As this Court described the contours of the duty in United States v. Bryan, 339 U.S. 323, 331, 70 S.Ct. 724, 730, 94 L.Ed. 884 (1950): \"[P]ersons summoned as witnesses by competent authority have certain minimum duties and obligations which are necessary concessions to the public interest in the orderly operation of legislative and judicial machinery.  . . .  We have often iterated the importance of this public duty, which every person within the jurisdiction of the Government is bound to perform when properly summoned.\"  While the Court recognized that certain exemptions would be upheld, the \"primary assumption\" was that a summoned party must \"give what testimony one is capable of giving\" absent an exemption \"grounded in a substantial individual interest which has been found, through centuries of experience, to outweigh the public interest in the search for truth.\"  Ibid.\n\n\n9\nOne application of this broad duty to provide relevant evidence has been the recognition, since early times, of an obligation to provide certain forms of nontestimonial physical evidence.7  In Holt v. United States, 218 U.S. 245, 252-253, 31 S.Ct. 2, 6, 54 L.Ed. 1021 (1910) (Holmes, J.), the Court found that the common-law evidentiary duty permitted the compulsion of various forms of physical evidence.  In Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 764, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 1832, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966), this Court observed that traditionally witnesses could be compelled, in both state and federal courts, to submit to \"fingerprinting, photographing, or measurements, to write or speak for identification, to appear in court, to stand, to assume a stance, to walk, or to make a particular gesture.\"  See also United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967).  In Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 266-267, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 1953, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967), handwriting was held, \"like the . . . body itself\" to be an \"identifying physical characteristic,\" subject to production.  In United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 764, 35 L.Ed.2d 67 (1973), and United States v. Mara, 410 U.S. 19, 93 S.Ct. 774, 35 L.Ed.2d 99 (1973), this Court again confirmed that handwriting is in the nature of physical evidence which can be compelled by a grand jury in the exercise of its subpoena power.  See also United States v. Mullaney, 32 F. 370 (CC Mo.1887).\n\n\n10\nThis broad duty to provide most relevant, nonprivileged evidence has not been considered to exist only in the common law. The Court has recognized that by statute \"Congress may provide for the performance of this duty.\"  Blackmer v. United States, 284 U.S. 421, 438, 52 S.Ct. 252, 255, 76 L.Ed. 375 (1932).  By imposing an obligation to produce documents as well as to appear and give testimony, we believe the language of \u00a7 7602 suggests an intention to codify a broad testimonial obligation, including an obligation to provide some physical evidence relevant and material to a tax investigation, subject to the traditional privileges and limitations.  This conclusion seems inherent in the imposition of an obligation to \"appear,\" since an obligation to appear necessarily entails an obligation to display physical features to the summoning authority.  Congress thereby authorized the Service to compel the production of some physical evidence, and it is certainly possible to conclude that this authorization extended to the execution of handwriting exemplars, one variety of relevant physical evidence.  This construction of the language conforms with the historical notions of the testimonial duty attaching to the issuance of a summons.8\n\nB\n\n11\nCongress certainly could have narrowed the common-law testimonial duty in enacting \u00a7 7602, and thus we do not rely solely on the common-law meaning of the statutory language. Section 7602 does not, by its terms, compel the production of handwriting exemplars, and therefore, a narrower interpretation of the duty imposed is not precluded by the actual language of the statute.  A narrower interpretation is precluded, however, by the precedents of this Court construing that statute.  As early as 1911, this Court established the benchmarks for interpreting the authority of the Internal Revenue Service to enforce tax obligations in holding that \"the administration of the statute may well be taken to embrace all appropriate measures for its enforcement, [unless] there is  . . .  substantial reason for assigning to the phrase[s]  . . .  a narrower interpretation.\" United States v. Chamberlin, 219 U.S. 250, 269, 31 S.Ct. 155, 162, 55 L.Ed. 204.  This precise mode of construction has consistently been applied by this Court in construing the breadth of the summons authority Congress intended to confer in \u00a7 7602.  InUnited States v. Powell, 379 U.S. 48, 85 S.Ct. 248, 13 L.Ed.2d 112 (1964), the Court declined to construe \u00a7 7605(b), prohibiting the Secretary from conducting \"unnecessary examination[s],\" to require probable cause for the issuance of a \u00a7 7602 summons.  The Court found that \"[a]lthough a more stringent interpretation is possible, one which would require some showing of cause for suspecting fraud, we reject such an interpretation because it might seriously hamper the Commissioner in carrying out investigations he thinks warranted  . . .\"  379 U.S., at 53-54, 85 S.Ct., at 253.  In Donaldson v. United States, 400 U.S. 517, 91 S.Ct. 534, 27 L.Ed.2d 580 (1971), the Court refused to hold that the summons authority could not be used whenever there was a potential that the civil investigation might later lead to criminal prosecution.  In construing the scope of the summons authority, the Court emphasized that it refused to draw the line in a manner that would \"stultify enforcement of federal law.\" Id., at 536, 91 S.Ct., at 545.  Finally, in United States v. Bisceglia, 420 U.S. 141, 95 S.Ct. 915, 43 L.Ed.2d 88 (1975), the Court upheld the Service's authority to issue a John Doe summons to a bank in order to discover the identity of an individual unknown to the Service.  The Court reasoned that absent that construction, \"no meaningful investigation of such events could be conducted\" and thus \"[s]ettled principles of statutory interpretation require that we avoid such a result absent unambiguous directions from Congress.\"  Id., at 150, 95 S.Ct., at 921.  There is thus a formidable line of precedent construing congressional intent to uphold the claimed enforcement authority of the Service if such authority is necessary for the effective enforcement of the revenue laws and is not undercut by contrary legislative purposes.9\n\n\n12\nApplying these principles, we conclude that Congress empowered the Service to seek, and obliged the witness to provide, handwriting exemplars relevant to the investigation.  First, there is no question that handwriting exemplars will often be an important evidentiary component in establishing tax liability. The statutory framework, as reviewed in the numerous precedents recited supra, imposes on the Secretary of the Treasury, and the IRS as his designate, a broad duty to enforce the tax laws.  26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7601(a).  Congress has legislated that the Secretary is \"required to make the inquiries, determinations, and ASSESSMENTS OF ALL TAXES  . . .  IMPOSED BY THIS TITLE  . . . .\"  26 u.s.c. \u00a7 6201(a).  Under \u00a7 6301 the Secretary \"shall collect the taxes imposed by the internal revenue laws.\"  In order to fulfill these duties, the Service will often need to determine whether a particular name is an alias of a taxpayer.  One effective method for resolving that issue is through the use of handwriting exemplars.10  As we recognized in Bisceglia, the IRS does have a need for investigative devices which assist them in ascertaining the identity of tax evaders.  In Bisceglia, we held, in language relevant to this case:\n\n\n13\n\"[I]f criminal activity is afoot the persons involved may      well have used aliases or taken other measures to cover their      tracks.  Thus, if the Internal Revenue Service is unable to      issue a summons to determine the identity of such persons,      the broad inquiry authorized by \u00a7 7601 will be frustrated in      this class of cases.  Settled principles of statutory      interpretation require that we avoid such a result absent      unambiguous directions from Congress.\"  420 U.S., at 150, 95      S.Ct., at 921.\n\n\n14\nThere is certainly nothing in the statutory language,11 or in the legislative history,12 precluding the interpretation asserted by the Service.  Nor is there any constitutional privilege of the taxpayer or other parties that is violated by this construction.  Compulsion of handwriting exemplars is neither a search or seizure subject to Fourth Amendment protections, United States v. Mara, 410 U.S. 19, 93 S.Ct. 774, 35 L.Ed.2d 99 (1973), nor testimonial evidence protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967).  The compulsion of handwriting exemplars has been the subject of far less protection than the compulsion of testimony and documents.13 Since Congress has explicitly established an obligation to provide the more protected forms of evidence, it would seem curious had it chosen not to impose an obligation to produce a form of evidence tradition has found it less important to protect.14\n\n\n15\nAs we have emphasized in other cases dealing with \u00a7 7602 proceedings, the summoned party is entitled to challenge the issuance of the summons in an adversary proceeding in federal court prior to enforcement, and may assert appropriate defenses. See Bisceglia, 420 U.S., at 151, 95 S.Ct., at 921.  The Service must also establish compliance with the good-faith requirements recognized by this Court, United States v. LaSalle National Bank, 437 U.S., at 318, 98 S.Ct., at 2368, and with the requirement of \u00a7 7605(b) that \"[n]o taxpayer shall be subjected to unnecessary examination or investigations  . . . .\"  These protections are quite sufficient to lead us to refuse to strain to imply additional ones from the neutral language Congress has used in \u00a7 7602.\n\n\n16\nWe accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals refusing enforcement of the summons.\n\n\n17\nReversed.\n\n\n18\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL and Mr. Justice STEVENS join, dissenting.\n\n\n19\nThe Internal Revenue Service, unlike common-law courts, has only such authority as Congress gives it.  Cf. United States v. LaSalle National Bank, 437 U.S. 298, 307, 98 S.Ct. 2357, 2362, 57 L.Ed.2d 221 (1978) (validity of Service summonses depends on \"whether they were among those authorized by Congress\").  Congress has granted the Service authority to summon individuals \"to appear before the Secretary  . . .  at a time and place named in the summons and to produce such books, papers, records, or other data, and to give such testimony, under oath, as may be relevant or material to such inquiry  . . . .\"  26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602.  The Court holds today that this authority to compel \"testimony\" includes authority to compel the creation of handwriting exemplars.1 The Court, however, is unable to point to anything in the statutory language or legislative history that even suggests that the obligation to \"give testimony\" includes an obligation to create a handwriting exemplar.  Indeed, the Court concedes, as it must, that a handwriting exemplar is a kind of nontestimonial physical evidence.2  Certainly, Congress has the power to authorize the Service to compel the creation of exemplars, but it has not chosen to do so in \u00a7 7602.3  Accordingly, I dissent.\n\n\n20\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, dissenting.\n\n\n21\nIn my view, the Fifth Amendment's privilege against compulsory self-incrimination prohibits the Government from requiring a person to provide handwriting exemplars.  As I stated in my dissenting opinion in United States v. Mara, 410 U.S. 19, 33, 93 S.Ct. 774, 782, 35 L.Ed.2d 99 (1973), \"I cannot accept the notion that the Government can compel a man to cooperate affirmatively in securing incriminating evidence when that evidence could not be obtained without the cooperation of the suspect.\"  The Fifth Amendment privilege is rooted in \"the basic stream of religious and political principle[,]  . . .  reflects the limits of the individual's attornment to the state,\" In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 47, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1454, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967), and embodies the \"respect a government\u2014state or federal\u2014must accord to the dignity and integrity of its citizens,\" Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 460, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1620, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).  I continue to believe, then, that \"[i]t is only by prohibiting the Government from compelling an individual to cooperate affirmatively in securing incriminating evidence which could not be obtained without his active assistance, that 'the inviolability of the human personality' is assured.\"  United States v. Mara, supra, 410 U.S., at 34-35, 93 S.Ct., at 782-83 (dissenting opinion) (quoting Miranda v. Arizona, supra, 384 U.S., at 460, 86 S.Ct., at 1620).\n\n\n22\nIn order to avoid this constitutional problem, I agree with my Brother BRENNAN, see ante, p. 719, that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602 should be construed not to permit Internal Revenue Service personnel to compel the production of handwriting exemplars.  Accordingly, I dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n The Fourth Circuit reached a contrary result in United States v. Rosinsky, 547 F.2d 249 (1977).  The Sixth Circuit decided this issue in accord with the Eighth Circuit.  United States v. Brown, 536 F.2d 117 (1976).\n\n\n2\n The precise reasons for the court's holding are not clear. In the opinion, the court suggests that the statute does not authorize the IRS to compel a taxpayer to create evidence \"out of thin air.\"  587 F.2d 25, 27, n. 3 (1978).  The opinion also states, however, that it adopts the views expressed in the dissenting opinion in United States v. Campbell, 524 F.2d 604, 608 (CA8 1975).  The principal reason forwarded in that decision for declining to construe \u00a7 7602 to authorize production of handwriting exemplars was the conclusion that such an order would constitute a seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  As discussed infra, neither rationale supports the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n3\n Responsibility for administration and enforcement of the revenue laws is vested in the Secretary of the Treasury.  26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7801(a).  The Internal Revenue Service, however, is organized to carry out those responsibilities for the Secretary. See Donaldson v. United States, 400 U.S., at 534, 91 S.Ct., at 544;  35 Fed.Reg. 2417 et seq. (1970).  For the purposes of this opinion, we refer to the authority and responsibilities of the Secretary and the Service interchangeably.\n\n\n4\n \"Sec. 7602. Examination of Books and Witnesses.\n\"For the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return, making a return where none has been made, determining the liability of any person for any internal revenue tax or the liability at law or in equity of any transferee or fiduciary of any person in respect of any internal revenue tax, or collecting any such liability, the Secretary or his delegate is authorized\u2014\n\"(1) To examine any books, papers, records, or other data which may be relevant or material to such inquiry;\n\"(2) To summon the person liable for tax or required to perform the act, or any officer or employee of such person, or any person having possession, custody, or care of books of account containing entries relating to the business of the person liable for tax or required to perform the act, or any other person the Secretary or his delegate may deem proper, to appear before the Secretary or his delegate at a time and place named in the summons and to produce such books, papers, records, or other data, and to give such testimony, under oath, as may be relevant or material to such inquiry;  and\n\"(3) To take such testimony of the person concerned, under oath, as may be relevant or material to such inquiry.\"\n\n\n5\n Legislative efforts to expand the scope of the testimonial obligation would, of course, be limited by the applicable constitutional guarantees.\n\n\n6\n The word \"testimony\" has been used loosely in this context to refer to physical and documentary, as well as oral, evidence. See 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2194, p. 76 (McNaughton Rev. 1961).\n\n\n7\n Wigmore has identified the testimonial duty as including an obligation \"to disclose for the purpose of justice all that is in his control which can serve the ascertainment of the truth, [and] this duty includes not only mental impressions preserved in his brain and the documents preserved in his hands, but also the corporal facts existing on his body.\"  Ibid.\n\n\n8\n As indicated elsewhere, we do not suggest that the evidentiary obligation codified in \u00a7 7602 in all respects conforms to the common law.  We rely on the analogy only as one interpretive guide.  Supra, at 712.\n\n\n9\n Congressional intent to provide the Secretary with broad latitude to adopt enforcement techniques helpful in the performance of his tax collection and assessment responsibilities is expressed throughout the Code.  In \u00a7 6302, for example, Congress has conferred the Secretary with discretion to devise methods of tax collection not specifically provided by statute:\n\"Whether or not the method of collecting any tax imposed  . . .  is specifically provided for by this title, any such tax may . . .  be collected by  . . .  other reasonable devices or methods as may be necessary or helpful in securing a complete and proper collection of the tax.\"\n\n\n10\n The United States suggests there are numerous uses of handwriting exemplars helpful to the Service.  Not only are they useful in identifying the holder of a bank account, but they are also said to be useful for identifying persons who file multiple tax returns under false names claiming income tax refunds, purchase of money orders under false names, and forgery of joint returns to take advantage of lower joint rates.\n\n\n11\n Respondent argues that the language of \u00a7 7602 suggests that it only requires the production of documents already in existence.  Since handwriting exemplars must be created by the witness, it is argued that the statute is inapplicable.  First, we do not view the exhibition of physical characteristics to be equivalent to the creation of documentary evidence.  See United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1, 6, 93 S.Ct. 764, 767, 35 L.Ed.2d 67 (1973).  Further, the statute obviously contemplates the transformation of some evidence not formerly tangible, since it obligates the summoned individual to provide testimony.  The testimony, of course, creates evidence not previously in existence.  We see no difference between the nature of the evidence created when the witness is ordered to talk and that created when he is ordered to write.\nWe express no opinion on the scope of the Service's authority to otherwise order the witness to generate previously nonexistent documentation under \u00a7 7602.  The Service in fact has expressly disclaimed any intention to order the creation of documents.  The Internal Revenue Manual \u00a7 4022.64(4) (CCH 1977) provides that an administrative summons\n\"should not require the witness to do anything other than to appear on a given date to give testimony and to bring with him\/her existing books, papers and records.  A witness cannot be required to prepare or create documents.\"\nThe section states, however, that \"[t]he giving of exemplars, for example, handwriting exemplars, at an appearance pursuant to a summons is not 'creating a document.' \"\n\n\n12\n The legislative history is simply unilluminating.  The only conclusion which that history supports is that Congress did not intend to change the expanse of the \u00a7 7602 summons authority by its amendments in 1954.  H.R.Rep.No.1337, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. (1954);  S.Rep.No.1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. (1954), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1954, p. 4025.  Since there are no pre-1954 interpretations of the statute precluding the issuance of handwriting exemplars, the legislative history sheds no light on the construction intended by Congress.\n\n\n13\n Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967), demonstrates the minimal level of protection afforded handwriting exemplars, and the reasons why such protection is unnecessary.  The Court found that production of the exemplars was not subject to the Fifth Amendment privilege, and that their creation did not represent a critical stage requiring counsel.  The Court found only a \"minimal risk that the absence of counsel might derogate from [a] right to a fair trial.\"  Id., at 267, 87 S.Ct., at 1953.  The Court concluded that \"[i]f, for some reason, an unrepresentative exemplar is taken, this can be brought out and corrected through the adversary process at trial since the accused can make an unlimited number of additional exemplars for analysis and comparison by government and defense handwriting experts.\"  Ibid.\n\n\n14\n Palmer v. United States, 530 F.2d 787 (CA8 1976), similarly construed 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826(a).  That statute authorizes the imposition of contempt on witnesses who refuse to \"testify or provide other information.\"  The statute does not explicitly authorize contempt sanctions for refusal to execute handwriting exemplars.  The court found that the legislative history indicated that Congress had intended, through the use of the language employed in the statute, to \"codify present civil contempt practice.\"  Since that practice had included the power to punish a witness for refusing to create a handwriting exemplar, the court reasoned that Congress must have thought this phrasing adequate to cover production of handwriting samples.\n\n\n1\n The Court also places some reliance on the word \"appear,\" which the Court suggests \"necessarily entails an obligation to display physical features to the summoning authority.\"  Ante, at 714.  Plainly \"appear\" adds nothing to the authority of the Service.  The word is used only to indicate that the person summoned must deliver the requested testimony or documents at the designated time and place.\n\n\n2\n The Court's use of the label \"nontestimonial\" is meaningful, for \"[t]estimony properly means only such evidence as is delivered by a witness  . . . , (either orally or in the form of affidavits or depositions.\"  Black's Law Dictionary 1324 (5th ed. 1979).  Testimony is a statement of knowledge or belief by a witness as opposed to the mere display of a physical characteristic.\n\n\n3\n Even if I thought the statute were ambiguous, I would reach the same result because I strongly believe that \"until Congress has stated otherwise, our duty to protect the rights of the individual should hold sway over the interest in more effective law enforcement.\"  Dalia v. United States, 441 U.S. 238, 263, 99 S.Ct. 1682, 1696, 60 L.Ed.2d 177 (1979) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\n\n\n","label":0}

On September 30, 1976, petitioner recanted his testimony in an oral statement made under oath in the office of Musgrave's attorney.  Musgrave then moved to dismiss his indictment, alleging that it was based on perjured testimony.  At an evidentiary hearing on this motion on October 21, 1976, petitioner adopted his September 30 statement and testified that only a small part of his grand jury testimony was true.  As a result, the charges against Musgrave were reduced.  Petitioner was subsequently indicted for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623 (1976 ed., Supp. I), which prohibits false declarations made under oath \"in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury.\"  The indictment charged that petitioner's grand jury testimony was inconsistent with statements made \"on September 30, 1976, while under oath as a witness in a proceeding ancillary to\" the Musgrave prosecution.  At trial, the Government introduced, over petitioner's objection, pertinent parts of his grand jury testimony, his testimony at the evidentiary hearing, and his sworn statement to Musgrave's attorney.  Petitioner was convicted, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Although it agreed with petitioner that the September interview in the attorney's office was not an ancillary proceeding under \u00a7 1623, the court concluded that the October 21 hearing was such a proceeding.  While acknowledging that the indictment specified the September 30 interview rather than the October 21 hearing as the ancillary proceeding, the court construed this discrepancy as a nonprejudicial variance between the indictment and the proof at trial.\n\nHeld:\n\n1. Since the indictment and jury instructions specified the September 30 interview as the ancillary proceeding, the Court of Appeals erred in predicating its affirmance on petitioner's October 21 testimony.  To uphold a conviction on a charge that was neither alleged in an indictment nor presented to a jury offends the most basic notions of due process.  Although the jury might well have reached the same verdict had the prosecution built its case on petitioner's October 21 testimony adopting his September 30 statement rather than on the latter statement itself, the offense was not so defined, and appellate courts are not free to revise the basis on which a defendant is convicted simply because the same result would likely obtain on retrial. Pp. 105-107.\n2. As both the language and legislative history of Title IV of the 1970 Organized Crime Control Act make clear, an interview in a private attorney's office at which a sworn statement is given does not constitute a \"proceeding ancillary to a court or grand jury\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1623.  Moreover, to characterize such an interview as an ancillary proceeding would contravene the long-established practice of resolving doubt concerning the ambit of criminal statutes in favor of lenity.  Pp. 107-113.\n10th Cir., 577 F.2d 119, reversed.\nDaniel J. Sears, Denver, Colo., for petitioner.\nAndrew L. Frey, Washington, D. C., for respondent.\nMr. Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nTitle IV of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623 (1976 ed., Supp. I), prohibits false declarations made under oath \"in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United States.\"1  This case turns on the scope of the term ancillary proceeding in \u00a7 1623, a phrase not defined in that provision or elsewhere in the Criminal Code. More specifically, we must determine whether an interview in a private attorney's office at which a sworn statement is given constitutes a proceeding ancillary to a court or grand jury within the meaning of the statute.\n\n\n2\n* On June 16, 1976, petitioner Robert Dunn testified before a federal grand jury under a grant of immunity pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6002.2  The grand jury was investigating illicit drug activity at the Colorado State Penitentiary where petitioner had been incarcerated.  Dunn's testimony implicated a fellow inmate, Phillip Musgrave, in various drug-related offenses. Following petitioner's appearance, the grand jury indicted Musgrave for conspiracy to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine.\n\n\n3\nSeveral months later, on September 30, 1976, Dunn arrived without counsel in the office of Musgrave's attorney, Michael Canges.  In the presence of Canges and a notary public, petitioner made an oral statement under oath in which he recanted his grand jury testimony implicating Musgrave.  Canges subsequently moved to dismiss the indictment against Musgrave, alleging that it was based on perjured testimony.  In support of this motion, the attorney submitted a transcript of Dunn's September 30 statement.\n\n\n4\nThe District Court held an evidentiary hearing on Musgrave's motion to dismiss on October 21, 1976.  At that hearing, petitioner, who was then represented by counsel, adopted the statement he had given in Canges' office and testified that only a small part of what he had told the grand jury was in fact true. App. 46.  As a result of petitioner's testimony, the Government reduced the charges against Musgrave to misdemeanor possession of methamphetamine.  See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844.\n\n\n5\nPetitioner was subsequently indicted on five counts of making false declarations in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623 (1976 ed., Supp. I).  The indictment charged that Dunn's testimony before the grand jury was inconsistent with statements made \"on September 30, 1976, while under oath as a witness in a proceeding ancillary to United States v. Musgrave,  . . .  to the degree that one of said declarations was false  . . . .\"  App. 5-6.3  In response to petitioner's motion for a bill of particulars, the Government indicated that it would rely on the \"inconsistent declarations\" method of proof authorized by \u00a7 1623(c).  Under that subsection, the Government must establish the materiality and inconsistency of declarations made in proceedings before or ancillary to a court or grand jury, but need not prove which of the declarations is false.  See n. 1, supra.\n\n\n6\nAt trial, the Government introduced over objection pertinent parts of Dunn's grand jury testimony, his testimony at the October 21 evidentiary hearing, and his sworn statement to Musgrave's attorney.  After the Government rested its case, petitioner renewed his objections in a motion for acquittal.  He contended that the September 30 statement was not made in a proceeding ancillary to a federal court or grand jury as required by \u00a7 1623(c).  In addition, Dunn argued that use of his grand jury testimony to prove an inconsistent declaration would contravene the Government's promise of immunity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6002 and the Fifth Amendment.  The court denied the motion and submitted the case to the jury.  Petitioner was convicted on three of the five counts of the indictment and sentenced to concurrent 5-year terms on each count.\n\n\n7\nThe Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.  577 F.2d 119 (1978).  Although it agreed with petitioner that the interview in Canges' office was not an ancillary proceeding under \u00a7 1623, the court determined that the October 21 hearing at which petitioner adopted his September statement was a proceeding ancillary to a grand jury investigation.  577 F.2d, at 123. Acknowledging that the indictment specified the September 30 interview rather than the October 21 hearing as the ancillary proceeding, the Court of Appeals construed this discrepancy as a nonprejudicial variance between the indictment and proof at trial.  Id., at 123-124.  The court also upheld the use of petitioner's immunized grand jury testimony to prove a \u00a7 1623 violation.  In so ruling, the court stated that immunized testimony generally may not be used to establish an inconsistent declaration without a prior independent showing that the testimony is false.  But, in the court's view, petitioner's unequivocal concession at the October hearing that he had testified falsely before the grand jury justified the Government's reliance on that testimony.  577 F.2d, at 125-126.\n\n\n8\nWe granted certiorari, 439 U.S. 1045, 99 S.Ct. 719, 58 L.Ed.2d 703 (1978).  Because we disagree with the Court of Appeals' ultimate disposition of the ancillary-proceeding issue, we reverse without reaching the question whether petitioner's immunized testimony was admissible to prove a violation of \u00a7 1623.\n\nII\n\n9\nA variance arises when the evidence adduced at trial establishes facts different from those alleged in an indictment. Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935).  In the instant case, since the indictment specified the September 30 interview rather than the October 21 hearing as the ancillary proceeding, the Court of Appeals identified a variance between the pleadings and the Government's proof at trial. However, reasoning that petitioner's October 21 testimony was \"inextricably related\" to his September 30 declaration, the court concluded that petitioner could have anticipated that the prosecution would introduce the October testimony.  577 F.2d, at 123.  The court therefore determined that the variance was not fatal to the Government's case.  See Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 757, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1243, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946).\n\n\n10\nIn our view, it is unnecessary to inquire, as did the Court of Appeals, whether petitioner was prejudiced by a variance between what was alleged in the indictment and what was proved at trial.  For we discern no such variance.  The indictment charged inconsistency between petitioner's statements in the September 30 interview and his grand jury testimony.  That was also the theory on which the case was tried and submitted to the jury.4  Indeed, the October 21 testimony was introduced by the Government only in rebuttal to dispel any inference that petitioner's grand jury testimony was true.  See Tr. 82-83.  But while there was no variance between the indictment and proof at trial, there was a discrepancy between the basis on which the jury rendered its verdict and that on which the Court of Appeals sustained petitioner's conviction.  Whereas the jury was instructed to rest its decision on Dunn's September statement, the Tenth Circuit predicated its affirmance on petitioner's October testimony.  The Government concedes that this ruling was erroneous.  Brief for United States 15, 35;  Tr. of Oral Arg. 25.  We agree.\n\n\n11\nTo uphold a conviction on a charge that was neither alleged in an indictment nor presented to a jury at trial offends the most basic notions of due process.  Few constitutional principles are more firmly established than a defendant's right to be heard on the specific charges of which he is accused.  See Eaton v. Tulsa, 415 U.S. 697, 698-699, 94 S.Ct. 1228, 1229-1230, 39 L.Ed.2d 693 (1974) (per curiam );  Garner v. Louisiana, 368 U.S. 157, 163-164, 82 S.Ct. 248, 251-252, 7 L.Ed.2d 207 (1961);  Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U.S. 196, 201, 68 S.Ct. 514, 517, 92 L.Ed. 644 (1948);  De Jonge v. iOregon, 299 U.S. 353, 362, 57 S.Ct. 255, 259, 81 L.Ed. 278 (1937).  There is, to be sure, no glaring distinction between the Government's theory at trial and the Tenth Circuit's analysis on appeal.  The jury might well have reached the same verdict had the prosecution built its case on petitioner's October 21 testimony adopting his September 30 statement rather than on the September statement itself.  But the offense was not so defined, and appellate courts are not free to revise the basis on which a defendant is convicted simply because the same result would likely obtain on retrial.  As we recognized in Cole v. Arkansas, supra, 333 U.S., at 201, 68 S.Ct., at 517, \"[i]t is as much a violation of due process to send an accused to prison following conviction of a charge on which he was never tried as it would be to convict him upon a charge that was never made.\"  Thus, unless the September 30 interview constituted an ancillary proceeding, petitioner's conviction cannot stand.\n\nIII\n\n12\nCongress enacted \u00a7 1623 as part of the 1970 Organized Crime Control Act, Pub.L. 91-452, 84 Stat. 922, to facilitate perjury prosecutions and thereby enhance the reliability of testimony before federal courts and grand juries.  S.Rep.No. 91-617, pp. 58-59 (1969).  Invoking this broad congressional purpose, the Government argues for an expansive construction of the term ancillary proceeding.  Under the Government's analysis, false swearing in an affidavit poses the same threat to the fact-finding process as false testimony in open court.  Brief for United States 21.  Thus, the Government contends that any statements made under oath for submission to a court, whether given in an attorney's office or in a local bar and grill, fall within the ambit of \u00a7 1623.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 31.  In our judgment, the term \"proceeding,\" which carries a somewhat more formal connotation, suggests that Congress had a narrower end in view when enacting \u00a7 1623.  And the legislative history of the Organized Crime Control Act confirms that conclusion.\n\n\n13\nSection 1623 was a response to perceived evidentiary problems in demonstrating perjury under the existing federal statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621.5  As Congress noted, the strict common-law requirements for establishing falsity which had been engrafted onto the federal perjury statute often made prosecution for false statements exceptionally difficult.6  By relieving the Government of the burden of proving which of two or more inconsistent declarations was false, see \u00a7 1623(c), Congress sought to afford \"greater assurance that testimony obtained in grand jury and court proceedings will aid the cause of truth.\" S.Rep.No. 91-617, p. 59 (1969).  But nothing in the language or legislative history of the statute suggests that Congress contemplated a relaxation of the Government's burden of proof with respect to all inconsistent statements given under oath.  Had Congress intended such a result, it presumably would have drafted \u00a7 1623 to encompass all sworn declarations irrespective of whether they were made in proceedings before or ancillary to a court or grand jury. Particularly since Congress was aware that statements under oath were embraced by the federal perjury statute without regard to where they were given,7 the choice of less comprehensive language in \u00a7 1623 does not appear inadvertent.\n\n\n14\nThat Congress intended \u00a7 1623 to sweep less broadly than the perjury statute is also apparent from the origin of the term ancillary proceeding.  As initially introduced in Congress, the Organized Crime Control Act contained a version of \u00a7 1623 which encompassed only inconsistent statements made in any \"trial, hearing, or proceeding before any court or grand jury.\"8  When asked to comment on the proposed statute, the Department of Justice noted that the scope of the inconsistent declarations provision was \"not as inclusive\" as the perjury statute.  See Hearings on S. 30 et al. before the Subcommittee on Criminal Laws and Procedures of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 372 (1969) (hereinafter S. 30 Hearings). Significantly, the Justice Department did not suggest that the provision be made coextensive with the perjury statute.  However, in subsequent Senate Subcommittee hearings, Assistant Attorney General Wilson indicated, without elaboration, that the Department advocated \"including [under \u00a7 1623] other testimony, preliminary testimony and other statements, in the perjury field.\"  Id., at 389.\n\n\n15\nIn response to that general suggestion, Senator McClellan, on behalf of the Subcommittee, sent a letter to the Assistant Attorney General clarifying its purpose:\n\n\n16\n\"You also read Title IV not to cover 'pre-trial      depositions, affidavits and certifications.'  This was not      our intent in drafting the bill.  We had hoped that it would      be applicable, for example, to situations such as [the] kind      of pre-trial depositions that the enforcement of S. 1861      would present.  If we included in the statute the phrase      'proceedings before or ancillary to any court or grand jury,'      do you feel that this intent would be adequately expressed?\"      Id., at 409.9\n\n\n17\nThe Government attaches great significance to the qualification, \"for example,\" in Senator McClellan's letter. Because pretrial depositions were mentioned as illustrative, the Government interprets the term ancillary proceeding to subsume affidavits and certifications as well.  But that is not the inference the Department of Justice originally drew from the Senator's letter.  Responding to the proposed modification of \u00a7 1623, Assistant Attorney General Wilson did not advert to affidavits or certifications but stated only that\n\n\n18\n\"[i]nclusion of the phrase 'proceedings before or      ancillary to any court or grand jury' in the false statement      provision would in our opinion adequately bring within the      coverage of the provision pre-trial depositions such as that      contained in S. 1861.\"  S. 30 Hearings 411.\n\n\n19\nIn our view, the Justice Department's contemporaneous rather than its current interpretation offers the more plausible reading of the Subcommittee's intent.  Its attention having been drawn to the issue, had the Subcommittee wished to bring all affidavits and certifications within the statutory prohibition, Senator McClellan presumably would have so stated.\n\n\n20\nFinally, to construe the term ancillary proceeding in \u00a7 1623 as excluding statements given in less formal contexts than depositions would comport with Congress' use of the phrase in a related provision of the Organized Crime Control Act.  Title II of the Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6002, authorizes extension of immunity to any witness who claims his privilege against self-incrimination \"in a proceeding  . . .  ancillary to\" a court, grand jury, or agency of the United States, or before Congress or one of its committees. See n. 2, supra.  Although neither the House nor Senate Report defines the precise scope of \u00a7 6002, they both specify pretrial depositions as the sole example of what would constitute an ancillary proceeding under that provision.  H.R.Rep.No. 91-1549, p. 42 (1970);  S.Rep.No. 91-617, p. 145 (1969);  U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1970, p. 4007.\n\n\n21\nThus, both the language and history of the Act support the Court of Appeals' conclusion that petitioner's September 30 interview \"lack[ed] the degree of formality\" required by \u00a7 1623. 577 F.2d, at 123.10  For the Government does not and could not seriously maintain that the interview in Canges' office constituted a deposition.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 25.  Musgrave's counsel made no attempt to comply with the procedural safeguards for depositions set forth in Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 15 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503.  A court order authorizing the deposition was never obtained.11  Nor did petitioner receive formal notice of the proceeding or of his right to have counsel present.12  Indeed, petitioner did not even certify the transcript of the interview as accurate.13\n\n\n22\nTo characterize such an interview as an ancillary proceeding would not only take liberties with the language and legislative history of \u00a7 1623, it would also contravene this Court's long-established practice of resolving questions concerning the ambit of a criminal statute in favor of lenity.   Huddleston v. United States, 415 U.S. 814, 831, 94 S.Ct. 1262, 1271, 39 L.Ed.2d 782 (1974);  Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 812, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 1059, 28 L.Ed.2d 493 (1971);  Bell v. United States, 349 U.S. 81, 83, 75 S.Ct. 620, 622, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955).  This practice reflects not merely a convenient maxim of statutory construction.  Rather, it is rooted in fundamental principles of due process which mandate that no individual be forced to speculate, at peril of indictment, whether his conduct is prohibited.  Grayned v.

Accordingly, we hold that petitioner's September 30 declarations were not given in a proceeding ancillary to a court or grand jury within the meaning of the statute.14\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n24\n\nReversed.\n\n\n\n25\nMr. Justice POWELL took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n\n1\n In pertinent part, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623 (1976 ed., Supp. I) provides:\n\"(a) Whoever under oath (or in any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28, United States Code) in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United States knowingly makes any false material declaration or makes or uses any other information, including any book, paper, document, record, recording, or other material, knowing the same to contain any false material declaration, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\n*          *          *          *          *\n\"(c) An indictment or information for violation of this section alleging that, in any proceedings before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United States, the defendant under oath has knowingly made two or more declarations, which are inconsistent to the degree that one of them is necessarily false, need not specify which declaration is false if\u2014\n\"(1) each declaration was material to the point in question, and\n\"(2) each declaration was made within the period of the statute of limitations for the offense charged under this section.\n\"In any prosecution under this section, the falsity of a declaration set forth in the indictment or information shall be established sufficient for conviction by proof that the defendant while under oath made irreconcilably contradictory declarations material to the point in question in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury.

See App. 3-11.\n\n\n4\n The District Court instructed the jury that in order to convict petitioner, it had to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner \"while under oath, made irreconcilably contradictory declarations  . . .  in any proceeding before or ancillary to a court or grand jury.\"  Tr. 179.  The court did not define the term ancillary proceeding, but admonished the jury to render its verdict on the charges alleged in the indictment, which specified June 16, 1976, and September 30, 1976, as the proceedings at which inconsistent statements were given.  Id., at 175-176;  App. 3-11.  Moreover, both the Assistant United States Attorney and defense counsel focused their summations on the September 30 statement.  See Tr. 151, 167.\n\n\n5\n Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 provides:\n\"Whoever\u2014\n\"(1) having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true;  or\n\"(2) in any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28, United States Code, willfully subscribes as true any material matter which he does not believe to be true;\n\"is guilty of perjury and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, be fined not more than $2,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.  This section is applicable whether the statement or subscription is made within or without the United States.\"\n\n\n6\n In particular, Congress focused on the two-witness rule, under which \"the uncorroborated oath of one witness is not enough to establish the falsity of the testimony of the accused.\"  Hammer v. United States, 271 U.S. 620, 626, 46 S.Ct. 603, 604, 70 L.Ed. 1118 (1926);  accord, Weiler v. United States, 323 U.S. 606, 608-610, 65 S.Ct. 548, 549-550, 89 L.Ed. 495 (1945).

It is currently codified as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1968.\n\n\n10\n In arguing that petitioner's September 30 interview was an ancillary proceeding, the Government relies on United States v. Stassi, 583 F.2d 122 (CA3 1978), and United States v. Krogh, 366 F.Supp. 1255, 1256 (DC 1973).  The defendant in Stassi was convicted under \u00a7 1623 of making statements in a Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 11 guilty plea hearing that were irreconcilable with his declarations in an affidavit supporting a motion to vacate sentence.  Without adverting to any legislative history, the Court of Appeals affirmed on the theory that a false affidavit \"offends the administration of criminal justice as much as [other] false material declaration[s].\"  583 F.2d, at 127.  Insofar as Stassi's analysis is inconsistent with our decision here, we decline to follow it.  And Krogh affords no support for the Government's position in this case since the court there held only that a sworn deposition taken in the office of an Assistant United States Attorney General was a proceeding ancillary to a grand jury investigation.\n\n\n11\n Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503(a) provides:\n\"whenever due to exceptional circumstances it is in the interest of justice that the testimony of a prospective witness of a party be taken and preserved, the court at any time after the filing of an indictment or information may upon motion of such party and notice to the parties order that the testimony of such witness be taken by deposition  . . . .\"\nThe language of Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 15(a) is substantially the same.\n\n\n12\n See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3503(b), (c);  Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 15(b).\n\n\n13\n See App. 46;  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3503(d);  Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 15(d).\n\n\n14\n The Government points out that if this Court reverses petitioner's conviction on the ground that the September 30 statement was not given in an ancillary proceeding, petitioner will be subject to reindictment for making declarations in the October 21 hearing inconsistent with his testimony in the June 16 grand jury proceeding.  Thus, the Government urges us to reach the second question decided by the Court of Appeals concerning the use of petitioner's immunized testimony to prove a violation of \u00a7 1623.  Brief for United States 36-37.  We decline to render an advisory opinion based on the Government's suppositions not only that petitioner will be reindicted but also that he will be convicted after a trial at which the immunized testimony is introduced.\n\n\n","label":0}

EGAN, Governor of the State of Alaska, and  the State of Alaska.\nNo. 2.\nArgued Dec. 13 and 14, 1961.\nDecided March 5, 1962.\n\nRichard Schifter, Washington, D.C., for appellant.\nOscar H. Davis, Washington, D.C., for the United States, as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\nAvrum M. Gross, for appellee pro hac vice, by special leave of Court.\nRalph E. Moody, Anchorage, Alaska, for appellee.\nMr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis is an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, 362 P.2d 901, affirming the denial of an injunction against interference by the State with appellant's use of fish traps in the Annette Islands of southeastern Alaska. Appellant rests its claim in part on regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior whereby the Metlakatla Indian Community was accorded the right to erect and to operate salmon traps at four locations in waters surrounding the Annette Islands, which Congress set aside for its use in 1891. Alaska challenged this authorization by a state conservation law forbidding the use of salmon traps.\n\n\n2\nLong before the white man came to Alaska, the annual migrations of salmon from the sea into Alaska's rivers to spawn served as a food supply for the natives. Commercial salmon fishing has become vital for Alaska's economy, but its exploitation seriously threatened the resource even before the turn of the century. See Gruening, The State of Alaska (1954), pp. 75, 97. Congress in 1889, in 1896, in 1906, and again in 1924 enacted conservation measures, prohibiting any obstruction of waters to impede salmon migration, limiting the times and means of taking salmon and authorizing the appropriate department to impose further restrictions.1 When Alaska was established as a State, Congress withheld jurisdiction over her fisheries until she had made adequate provision for their administration.2\n\n\n3\nEqually with Congress, Alaska has been concerned with the evils of overexploitation. In particular she saw a menace in the fish trap, a labor-saving but costly device, which became in her eyes the symbol of exploitation of her resources by 'Stateside' colonialism. See Rogers, Alaska in Transition (1960), pp. 4\u201415; Gruening, supra, at pp. 392\u2014407; Gruening, Let Us End American Colonialism (1955), reprinted at 103 Cong.Rec. 470\u2014474. The fish trap, 'a formidable structure,' Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. United States, 248 U.S. 78, 87, 39 S.Ct. 40, 63 L.Ed. 138, consists principally of a fence or netting stretched across or partly across a stream to obstruct the upstream progress of the salmon and turn the fish into the 'heart' or 'pot' of the trap, where they are imprisoned until removed. See Rogers, supra, at p. 7; Gruening, The State of Alaska, supra, at pp. 169\u2014170. At one time there were about 700 salmon traps in operation in Alaska. The Secretary of the Interior felt that the fish trap's threat to conservation could be adequately dealt with by regulating the number of fish permitted to escape.3 Alaska vigorously opposed this. The Territorial Legislature several times sent memorials to Congress urging abolition of trap fishing.4 An ordinance to abolish all commercial traps was approved by Alaska voters along with the proposed State Constitution in 1956, and in early 1959 the first State Legislature turned this ordinance into the statute here under review.5\n\n\n4\nThe Metlakatla Indians, some 800, led by a British missionary, moved from British Columbia to Alaska in 1887. In 1891 the Annette Islands, south of Ketchikan at the extreme lower end of the Alaskan archipelago, were 'set apart as a reservation' by Congress for the Metlakatlans and other Indians, 'to be held and used by them in common, under such rules and regulations, and subject to such restrictions, as may be prescribed from time to time by the Secretary of the Interior.' 26 Stat. 1095, 1101, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 358, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 358. In 1915 the Secretary issued regulations, 25 CFR (1939 ed.), pt. 1, establishing an elective council to make local ordinances for Metlakatla, and also permitting members of the Community to obtain permits for the use of salmon traps in waters adjacent to the Annette Islands. The next year, in furtherance of the Secretary's plan to establish a salmon cannery at Metlakatla, President Wilson by proclamation declared the waters within 3,000 feet of certain of these islands to be a part of the Metlakatla Reserve, to be used by the Indians as a source of supply for the intended cannery, 'under the general fisheries laws and regulations of the United States as administered by the Secretary of Commerce.' 39 Stat. 1777.6 In 1918, without reference to the proclamation, this Court upheld the right of the Metlakatlans to exclude others from the waters surrounding their islands on the ground that these waters were included within the original reservation by Congress. Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. United States, 248 U.S. 78, 39 S.Ct. 40, 63 L.Ed. 138.\n\n\n5\nEver since 1915, Metlakatla has operated fish traps with the consent of the Secretary of the Interior. Following the enactment of the State's fish-trap law in 1959, the Secretary in the exercise of his transitional power over Alaska fisheries banned all fish traps except those operated by Metlakatla and by other Indians involved in the companion case, Organized Village of Kake v. Egan, 369 U.S. 60, 82 S.Ct. 562, 7 L.Ed.2d 573, 24 Fed.Reg. 2053, 2056, 2069 (1959). The following year, having relinquished general control of the fisheries, the Secretary again authorized Metlakatla to operate fish traps at four of eight specified locations, citing as authority the White Act, 43 Stat. 464, as amended, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 221\u2014228, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 221\u2014228, and \u00a7 4 of the Alaska Statehood Act, 72 Stat. 339, as amended by 73 Stat. 141, 48 U.S.C.A. preceding \u00a7 21. 25 CFR (1961 Supp.), pt. 88.7\n\n\n6\nWith this background we reach the present controversy. In May, 1959, just before the salmon season began, the State warned Metlakatla and other Indians that she would enforce the fishtrap law against them. The threat was intensified when the State arrested members of other Indian communities and seized one fish trap. Suits were thereupon filed by Metlakatla and by the appellants in the companion case in the interim United States District Court for the District of Alaska, seeking an injunction against interference with their asserted federal rights to fish with traps. All complaints were dismissed, 174 F.Supp. 500. Appeal was brought to this Court, as the Supreme Court of Alaska had not yet been fully organized. Pending decision, Mr. Justice BRENNAN granted a stay of enforcement by the State, 80 S.Ct. 33, 4 L.Ed.2d 34. The Court assumed jurisdiction and continued the stay but remanded the case to the newly constituted State Supreme Court primarily for its disposition of matters of local law, 363 U.S. 555, 80 S.Ct. 1321, 4 L.Ed.2d 1397. That Court affirmed the District Court's dismissal, holding the fish-trap law applicable to Metlakatla and to the other appellants, and upholding its validity as so applied, 362 P.2d 901. From its judgment, the appeal is properly here under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1257. We noted probable jurisdiction, 368 U.S. 886, 82 S.Ct. 137, 7 L.Ed.2d 86.\n\n\n7\nSeveral grounds of the decision below are now out of the case on concession of error by Alaska, but she firmly stands on the judgment in her favor. Metlakatla argues that it is immune from the fish-trap law because (1) state law cannot regulate Indian activities on Indian reservations; (2) the State cannot regulate a federal instrumentality; and (3) appellant has been authorized to operate traps by the Secretary of the Interior. The United States has supported Metlakatla as amicus curiae, see 362 U.S. 967, 80 S.Ct. 953.\n\n\n8\nThe Indians of southeastern Alaska, who have very substantially adopted and been adopted by the white man's civilization, were never in the hostile and isolated position of many tribes in other States. As early as 1886 a federal judge, holding Alaskan Indians subject to the Thirteenth Amendment, denied that the principle of Indian national sovereignty enunciated in Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 8 L.Ed. 483, applied to them. In re Sah Quah, 31 F. 327 (D.Alaska). There were no Indian wars in Alaska, although on at least one occasion, see Gruening, The State of Alaska (1954), pp. 36\u201437, there were fears of an uprising. There was never an attempt in Alaska to isolate Indians on reservations. Very few were ever created, and the purpose of these, in contrast to many in other States, was not to confine the Indians for the protection of the white settlers but to safeguard the Indians against exploitation. Alaskan Indians are now voting citizens, some of whom occupy prominent public office in the state government. See United States v. Booth, 161 F.Supp. 269, 17 Alaska 561 (D.Alaska 1958); United States v. Libby, McNeil & Libby, 107 F.Supp. 697, 699, 14 Alaska 37, 41\u201442 (D.Alaska 1952). Metlakatlans, the State tells us, have always paid state taxes, in contrast to the practice described and prescribed for other reservations in The Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737, 18 L.Ed. 667, and it has always been assumed that the reservation is subject to state laws. United States v. Booth, supra, 161 F.Supp., at 270, 17 Alaska, at 563. Congress in 1936, 49 Stat. 1250, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 358a, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 358a, by authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to create Indian reservations of land reserved for Indian uses under 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 358, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 358, seems to have believed that Metlakatla was no ordinary reservation, since Metlakatla alone is covered in \u00a7 358. Finally, in United States v. Booth, supra, the District Court for Alaska held that a crime comitted on the Metlakatla Reserve, before the extension of jurisdiction over Indian country to Alaska, see 369 U.S., p. 56, 82 S.Ct. p. 560, infra, was punishable under territorial laws, since for the reasons here outlined the Reserve was not 'Indian country' within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1151\u20141153, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1151\u20141153.\n\n\n9\nThe words 'set apart as a reservation,' appearing in the statute creating the Annette Islands Reserve, are substantially the same as used in numerous other statutory reservations. E.g., 13 Stat. 63 (Unita Valley, Utah); 13 Stat. 541, 559 (Colorado River); 18 Stat. 28 (Gros Ventre and others); 19 Stat. 28, 29 (Pawnee). None of these statutes made express provision for self-government or for state government. Some treaties, such as that with the Cherokees in 1828, 7 Stat. 311, expressly excluded state laws. Other treaties, however, while sometimes phrased in terms of a gift or assignment rather than a reservation of land, made no mention of state power. E.g., Treaty with the Shawnee Tribe, 1825, 7 Stat. 284; Treaty with the Potawatomies, 1837, 7 Stat. 532; Treaty with the New York Indians, 1838, 7 Stat. 550, 551; Treaty with the Sacs and Foxes, 1842, 7 Stat. 596. Later treaties 'set apart for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation' of the Indians certain lands. E.g., Treaty with the Arapahoes and Cheyennes, 1867, 15 Stat. 593, 594; Treaty with the Crow Indians, 1868, 15 Stat. 649. 650. The 1868 Treaty with the Navajos was similar. 15 Stat. 667, 668. And the 1855 treaty with the Quiault Indian Tribe, 12 Stat. 971, which the Supreme Court of Washington held barred state regulation of reservation fishing, promised only that lands would be 'reserved, for the use and occupation of the tribes.' It was implemented by an executive order of November 7, 1873, by which certain lands were 'withdrawn from sale and set apart for the use' of the tribe. See Pioneer Packing Co. v. Winslow, 159 Wash. 655, 657\u2014658, 294 P. 557, 558.\n\n\n10\nThe provision creating the Metlakatla Reserve in 1891 was added to a House bill dealing with timber lands on the floor of the Senate by Nebraska's Senator Manderson. Reciting the unfortunate experience of the Metlakatlans in British Columbia and their emigration to Alaska, Senator Manderson explained that his amendment was designed to dispel fears of expulsion from their new lands as from their old, or of intrusion by outsiders seeking to exploit the resources of the islands. The purpose, he stated, was 'simply to allow this band of Indians to remain there under such rules and regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may impose, and give them some recognized footing at that place.' Remarks by Senators Dawes and Dolph were to the same effect. 21 Cong.Rec. 10092\u201410093(1890). The amendment was agreed to and adopted by both Houses after a conference, with no further discussion.\n\n\n11\nThis provision subjecting Metlakatla to rules and regulations of the Secretary of the Interior is unusual. Since 1849 the Secretary had been the officer of the United States charged with administration of the Indian laws, but none of the treaties or statutes which have come to our attention contained such a provision. The Cheyenne and Crow treaties, supra, provided that Congress might regulate matters on the reservations, but this was no delegation of Congress' powers to the Secretary. It was but a recognition by the Indians of powers the Constitution gave to the national legislature.\n\n\n12\nThe regulations issued by the Secretary for the government of the Annette Islands January 28, 1915, appear to be without parallel. No such rules applying to other reservations are to be found in the Code of Federal Regulations. The Secretary vested powers of local government in an elective council, 25 CFR (1939 ed.), \u00a7 1.2, which was given authority to pass ordinances required not to conflict with 'the laws of the United States, the laws of the Territory of Alaska, or the rules and regulations in this part,' \u00a7 1.10, and subject to review by the Secretary, \u00a7 1.62. As a condition to the right to vote in local elections, members of the Reserve\u2014limited to Metlakatlans and other natives, \u00a7 1.51\u2014were required to swear obedience to local laws, laws of the United States, and laws of the Territory of Alaska, \u00a7 1.52. Thus the Secretary, in the exercise of the authority delegated him by Congress, subjected self-government of Metlakatla not only to federal oversight but to territorial laws as well. However, as discussed above, an additional regulation issued by the Secretary in 1915 authorized the use of fish traps at Metlakatla, and this permission has been continued in regulations issued since statehood.\n\n\n13\nAlaska urges that the regulations are invalid because neither the White Act nor the Statehood Act conferred authority on the Secretary to permit Metlakatlans to use fish traps. The State's premise is correct, Organized Village of Kake v. Egan, 369 U.S. 60, 82 S.Ct. 562, 7 L.Ed.2d 573. However, Congress in 1891 gave the Secretary authority to make rules governing the Metlakatla Reservation, and his authority, like the reservation itself, Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. United States, 248 U.S. 78, 39 S.Ct. 40, 63 L.Ed. 138, extended to the waters surrounding the islands. Does this Act validate the regulations in light of subsequent legislative and executive actions?\n\n\n14\nThe Presidential Proclamation of 1916, 39 Stat. 1777, declared waters within 3,000 feet of Annette and adjacent islands to be a part of the Metlakatla Reservation and provided that the Indians should have the use of these waters 'under the general fisheries laws and regulations of the United States as administered by the Secretary of Commerce.' Alaska argues that the purpose of this provision was to place Metlakatla fishermen in the same position as all others in Alaska by subjecting them to the same laws. In 1916 the general laws were federal; now they are those of the State. Therefore, the State contends, the policy of the Proclamation requires that the provision be construed as subjecting the Metlakatlans to the laws governing all other fishermen, which now include the state fish-trap law. The Metlakatlans have the right to exclude others from their waters, Alaska agrees, but not the right to be free from regulation.\n\n\n15\nAlaska does not argue that the Proclamation deprived the Secretary of the Interior of the authority Congress gave him to prescribe rules governing fishing and other activities on the Annette Islands. Assuming the President had power to do so, he did not purport to exercise it. Quite the contrary. The Proclamation recites that the Secretary has determined to establish a cannery for the Metlakatlans, that the Secretary has been given authority to make regulations for Metlakatla by the statute of 1891, and that protection of the Indians' fishing rights is required to assure a supply of fish for the cannery. Apparently the Proclamation was prompted by the threatened encroachment of non-Indian fishermen into Metlakatla waters and the fear that the reservation of the islands might not protect the Indians against such intrusions. No statutory authority for the Proclamation was cited. It was declared to be issued under authority of 'the laws of the United States.' It is clear that President Wilson was attempting to assist and promote the plans of the Secretary of the Interior to develop the reserve under his statutory authority, not to limit or destroy that authority. The subjection of Metlakatla to general fisheries laws and to regulations of the Secretary of Commerce thus did not make those laws and regulations superior to regulations of the Secretary of the Interior. Rather the general laws and Commerce regulations were adopted as a part of the Interior regulations, so far as not in conflict with other rules adopted by the Secretary of the Interior and subject to his further modification under the power given him in 1891.\n\n\n16\nNor did the White Act impair the Secretary's power. That statute permitted the Secretary for conservation purposes to limit the taking of salmon in areas of his designation, but prohibited his granting exclusive rights in so doing. This Court in Hynes v. Grimes Packing Co., 337 U.S. 86, 69 S.Ct. 968, 93 L.Ed. 1231, held that the prohibition bars the Secretary from creating exclusive White Act rights in Indians as well as in non-Indians, but it expressly disclaimed holding that no exclusive Indian rights may exist. 337 U.S., at 118\u2014119, 122 123, 69 S.Ct. 968. The Secretary's regulations did not create exclusivity; that was a part of the reservation as created in 1891 and clarified by the proclamation of 1916, which excluded others from fishing in Metlakatla waters.\n\n\n17\nIn 1958, 72 Stat. 545, Alaska was added to the list of States and Territories permitted to exercise civil and criminal jurisdiction over Indian reservations. The State has not argued that this took away the power of the Secretary of the Interior to make regulations contrary to state law. Appellant has argued, to the contrary, that the statute expressly preserved Indian fishing rights from state laws. The statute granting States civil and criminal jurisdiction was passed in 1953, 67 Stat. 588, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1162, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1162, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1360, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1360. Subsection (b) of that statute 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1162, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1162 provides that nothing therein shall authorize alienation encumbrance, or taxation of Indian property, 'or shall authorize regulation of the use of such property in a manner inconsistent with any Federal treaty, agreement, or statute or with any regulation made pursuant thereto; or shall deprive any Indian or any Indian tribe, band, or community of any right, privilege, or immunity afforded under Federal treaty, agreement, or statute with respect to hunting, trapping, or fishing or the control, licensing, or regulation thereof.'\n\n\n18\nThis statute expressly protects against state invasion all uses of Indian property authorized by federal treaty, agreement, statute, or regulation, but only those fishing rights and privileges given by federal treaty, agreement, or statute. It might plausibly be argued, therefore, that fishing rights given by regulation are not protected and state jurisdiction is established. Legislative history is silent as to the interpretation of the provision. See H. R. Rep. No. 848, 83d Cong., 1st Sess.; S.Rep. No. 699, 83d Cong., 1st Sess.; 99 Cong.Rec. 9962, 10782, 10928 (1953). The apparent purpose of the proviso was to preserve federally granted fishing rights. It would be sheer speculation to attribute significance to the imperfect parallelism of the provisions protecting property and fishing rights in the absence of any suggested reason for excluding fishing rights based on regulations. The process of statutory drafting and evolution, here veiled from scrutiny, is too imprecise to permit such an inference. Cf. United States v. Mersky, 361 U.S. 431, 437, 80 S.Ct. 459, 4 L.Ed.2d 423. In any event, the proviso also protects rights given the Indians by statute respecting the control and regulation of fishing, and the 1891 statute gave the Metlakatlans the right to fish under regulations of the Secretary of the Interior.\n\n\n19\nSection 6(e) of the Alaska Statehood Act, 72 Stat. 339, 340 341, 48 U.S.C.A. preceding \u00a7 21, providing for the conveyance of United States properties 'used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of the fisheries and wildlife of Alaska,' contemplated transfer to the State of the same measure of administration and jurisdiction over fisheries and wildlife as possessed by other States, S.Rep. No. 1929, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 13\u201414 (1950); H.R. Rep. No. 1731, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1948); S. Rep. No. 1028, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 31 (1954); S. Rep. No. 1163, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1957), see Geer v. State of Connecticut, 161 U.S. 519, 16 S.Ct. 600, 40 L.Ed. 793, after the transition period during which the State was to establish machinery for this purpose. Section 4, however, as amended by 73 Stat. 141, required Alaska to disclaim all right and title to any United States property not granted her by the statute, and also 'to any lands or other property (including fishing rights), the right or title to which may be held by any Indians, Eskimos, or Aleuts (hereinafter called natives) or is held by the United States in trust for said natives.' Such property was to 'be and remain under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the United States until disposed of under its authority, except to such extent as the Congress has prescribed or may hereafter prescribe,' with immaterial exceptions, and provided that claims against the United States are neither enlarged, diminished, nor recognized by these provisions. This disclaimer is substantially the same as found in the Acts admitting 13 other States. See S. Rep. No. 315, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. 15 (1951).\n\n\n20\nAlaska does not expressly argue that the Secretary's power was destroyed by the Statehood Act. She does, however, contend that control of all fishing was transferred to the State with no exception for Indian fishing, and that only the exclusiveness of Metlakatla's fishing rights was preserved. But legislative history makes clear that the transfer of jurisdiction over fishing was subject to rights reserved in \u00a7 4. S.Rep.No.1929, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1950).\n\n\n21\nClearly this section does not protect only 'recognized' Indian rights\u2014those the taking of which would be compensable by the United States. Committee reports demonstrate the aim of Congress to preserve the status quo as to a broader class of 'right,' including, in the case of land, mere possession or occupancy. Compensation was an issue Congress took pains to avoid. See H.R. Rep.No. 1731, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. 15 (1948); H.R. Rep. No. 255, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 13 (1949); S. Rep. No. 1028, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 4, 29\u201430 (1954); S. Rep. No. 1163, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 15 (1957). We need not here explore the remoter reaches of this protection. The Metlakatla Reservation was Indian property within \u00a7 4. Whether or not the 'absolute jurisdiction' retained by the United States in \u00a7 4 is exclusive of state authority, see Organized Village of Kake v. Egan, 369 U.S. 60, 82 S.Ct. 562, 7 L.Ed.2d 573, the statute clearly preserves federal authority over the reservation. Federal authority was lodged in the Secretary in 1891, and it was not dislodged by the Statehood Act.\n\n\n22\nHowever, in issuing the present regulations the Secretary relied not on the 1891 statute but on the White Act and the Statehood Act, neither of which authorized his action. In a letter to the Solicitor General, filed by the United States as an Appendix to its brief as amicus curiae, the Secretary left no doubt that in issuing the regulations he acted under compulsion of what he conceived to be his duty under the Statehood Act to preserve the status quo. He deemed himself, as it were, to be a mere automaton. The exercise of any authority that the Secretary has under the reservation statute to allow fish traps necessarily involves his judgment on a complex of facts, his evaluation of the relative weights of the Indians' need for traps and of the impact of traps at Metlakatla on the State's interest in conservation. We cannot make this determination for him.\n\n\n23\nThe appropriate course is to vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alaska and remand the case there to be held to give ample opportunity for the Secretary of the Interior with all reasonable expedition to determine prior to the 1963 salmon fishing season what, if any, authority he chooses to exercise in light of this opinion. Should the Secretary fail so to act, the parties may apply to the Alaska court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. See Addison v. Holly Hill Fruit Products, Inc., 322 U.S. 607, 618\u2014619, 64 S.Ct. 1215, 88 L.Ed. 1488. The stay granted by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN and continued by the Court will remain in force until the end of the 1962 salmon fishing season, as defined in the regulations issued by the Secretary of the Interior. It is so ordered.\n\n\n24\nJudgment vacated, and case remanded.\n\n\n\n1\n 25 Stat. 1009; 29 Stat. 316 (Treasury Department); 34 Stat. 478, now 48 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 230\u2014239, 241\u2014242 (Commerce Department), 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 230\u2014239, 241\u2014242; 43 Stat. 464, now 48 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 221\u2014228 (Commerce Department), 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 221\u2014228.

{"text":"411 U.S. 145\n93 S.Ct. 1267\n36 L.Ed.2d 114\nThe MESCALERO APACHE TRIBE, Petitioner,v.Franklin JONES, Commissioner of the Bureau of Revenue  of the State of New Mexico, et al.\nNo. 71\u2014738.\nArgued Dec. 12, 1972.\nDecided March 27, 1973.\n\nSyllabus\nThe State of New Mexico may impose a nondiscriminatory gross receipts tax on a ski resort operated by petitioner Tribe on off-reservation land that the Tribe leased from the Federal Government under \u00a7 5 of the Indian Reorganization Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 465. Though \u00a7 465 exempts the land acquired from state and local taxation, neither that provision nor the federal-instrumentality doctrine bars taxing income from the land. But \u00a7 465 bars a use tax that the State seeks to impose on personalty that the Tribe purchased out of State and which, having been installed as a permanent improvement at the resort, became so intimately connected with the land itself as to be encompassed by the statutory exemption. Pp. 147\u2014159.\n83 N.M. 158, 489 P.2d 666, affirmed in part and reversed in part.\nGeorge E. Fettinger, Alamogordo, N.M., for petitioner.\nJohn C. Cook, Santa Fe, N.M., for respondents.\nMr. Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe Mescalero Apache Tribe operates a ski resort in the State of New Mexico, on land located outside the boundaries of the Tribe's reservation. The State has asserted the right to impose a tax on the gross receipts of the ski resort and a use tax on certain personalty purchased out of State and used in connection with the resort. Whether paramount federal law permits these taxes to be levied is the issue presented by this case.\n\n\n2\nThe home of the Mescalero Apache Tribe is on reservation lands in Lincoln and Otero Counties in New Mexico. The Sierra Blanca Ski Enterprises, owned and operated by the Tribe, is adjacent to the reservation and was developed under the auspices of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 984, as amended, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 461 et seq.1 After a feasibility study by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, equipment and construction money was provided by a loan from the Federal Government under \u00a7 10 of the Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 470, and the necessary land was leased from the United States Forest Service for a term of 30 years. The ski area borders on the Tribe's reservation but, with the exception of some cross-country ski trails, no part of the enterprise, its buildings or equipment is located within the existing boundaries of the reservation.\n\n\n3\nThe Tribe has paid under protest $26,086.47 in taxes to the State, pursuant to the sales tax law, N.M.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 72\u201416\u20141 et seq. (1953), based on the gross receipts of the ski resort from the sale of services and tangible property.2 In addition, in 1968 the State assessed compensating use taxes against the Tribe in the amount of $5,887.19 (plus penalties and interest), based on the purchase price of materials used to construct two ski lifts at the resort. N.M.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 72\u201417\u20141 et seq. (1953). The Tribe duly protested the use tax assessment and sought a refund of the sales taxes paid. The State Commissioner of Revenue denied both the claim for refund and the protest of assessment and the Court of Appeals of the State affirmed. The court held, essentially, that the State had authority to apply its non-discriminatory taxes to the Tribe's enterprise and property involved in the dispute, and that the Indian Reorganization Act did not render the Tribe's enterprise a federal instrumentality, constitutionally immune from state taxation, nor did it, by its own terms, grant immunity from the taxes here involved. 83 N.M. 158, 489 P.2d 666 (1971). The Supreme Court of New Mexico denied certiorari. 83 N.M. 151, 489 P.2d 659 (1971). We granted the Tribe's petition for a writ of certiorari, 406 U.S. 905, 92 S.Ct. 1604, 31 L.Ed.2d 815, to consider its claim that the income and property of the ski resort are not properly subject to state taxation. We affirm in part and in part reverse.\n\n\n4\n* At the outset, we reject\u2014as did the state court\u2014the broad assertion that the Federal Government has exclusive jurisdiction over the Tribe for all purposes and that the State is therefore prohibited from enforcing its revenue laws against any tribal enterprise '(w)hether the enterprise is located on or off tribal land.'3 Generalizations on this subject have become particularly treacherous. The conceptual clarity of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall's view in Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 556\u2014561, 8 L.Ed. 483 (1832), has given way to more individualized treatment of particular treaties and specific federal statutes, including statehood enabling legislation, as they, taken together, affect the respective rights of States, Indians, and the Federal Government. See McClanahan v. State Tax Commission of Arizona, 411 U.S. 164, 93 S.Ct. 1257, 36 L.Ed.2d 129; Organized Village of Kake v. Egan, 369 U.S. 60, 71 73, 82 S.Ct. 562, 568\u2014569, 7 L.Ed.2d 573 (1962). The upshot has been the repeated statements of this Court to the effect that, even on reservations, state laws may be applied unless such application would interfere with reservation self-government or would impair a right granted or reserved by federal law. Organized Village of Kake, supra, at 75, 82 S.Ct. at 570; Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217, 79 S.Ct. 269, 3 L.Ed.2d 251 (1959); New York ex rel. Ray v. Martin, 326 U.S. 496, 499, 66 S.Ct. 307, 308, 90 L.Ed. 261 (1946); Draper v. United States, 164 U.S. 240, 17 S.Ct. 107, 41 L.Ed. 419 (1896). Even so, in the special area of state taxation, absent cession of jurisdiction or other federal statutes permitting it, there has been no satisfactory authority for taxing Indian reservation lands or Indian income from activities carried on within the boundaries of the reservation, and McClanahan v. State Tax Commission of Arizona, supra, lays to rest any doubt in this respect by holding that such taxation is not permissible absent congressional consent.\n\n\n5\nBut tribal activities conducted outside the reservation present different considerations. 'State authority over Indians is yet more extensive over activities . . . not on any reservation.' Organized Village of Kake, supra, 369 U.S., at 75, 82 S.Ct., at 571. Absent express federal law to the contrary, Indians going beyond reservation boundaries have generally been held subject to non-discriminatory state law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the State. See, e.g., Puyallup Tribe v. Department of Game, 391 U.S. 392, 398, 88 S.Ct. 1725, 1728, 20 L.Ed.2d 689 (1968); Organized Village of Kake, supra, 369 U.S., at 75\u201476, 82 S.Ct., at 570\u2014571; Tulee v. Washington, 315 U.S. 681, 683, 62 S.Ct. 862, 863, 86 L.Ed. 1115 (1942); Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., 276 U.S. 575, 48 S.Ct. 333, 72 L.Ed. 709 (1928); Ward v. Race Horse, 163 U.S. 504, 16 S.Ct. 1076, 41 L.Ed. 244 (1896). That principle is as relevant to a State's tax laws as it is to state criminal laws, see Ward v. Race Horse, supra, at 516, 16 S.Ct., at 1080, and applies as much to tribal ski resorts as it does to fishing enterprises. See Organized Village of Kake, supra.\n\n\n6\nThe Enabling Act for New Mexico, 36 Stat. 557,4 reflects the distinction between on- and off-reservation activities. Section 2 of the Act provides that the people of the State disclaim 'all right and title' to lands 'owned or held by any Indian or Indian tribes the right or title to which shall have been acquired through or from the United States . . . and that . . . the same shall be and remain subject to the disposition and under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the Congress of the United States.' But the Act expressly provides, with respect to taxation, that 'nothing herein . . . shall preclude the said State from taxing, as other lands and other property are taxed, any lands and other property outside of an Indian reservation owned or held by any Indian, save and except such lands as have been granted . . . or as may be granted or confirmed to any Indian or Indians under any Act of Congress, but . . . all such lands shall be exempt from taxation by said State (only) so long and to such extent as Congress has prescribed or may hereafter prescribe.' It is thus clear that in terms of general power New Mexico retained the right to tax, unless Congress forbade it, all Indian land and Indian activities located or occurring 'outside of an Indian reservation.'5\n\n\n7\nWe also reject the broad claim that the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 rendered the Tribe's off-reservation ski resort a federal instrumentality constitutionally immune from state taxes of all sorts. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 4 L.Ed. 579 (1819). The intergovernmental-immunity doctrine was once much in vogue in a variety of contexts, and with respect to Indian affairs, was consistently held to bar a state tax on the lessees of, or the product or income from, restricted lands of tribes or individual Indians. The theory was that a federal instrumentality was involved and that the tax would interfere with the Government's realizing the maximum return for its wards. This approach did not survive; its rise and decline in Indian affairs is described and reflected in Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U.S. 376, 58 S.Ct. 623, 82 L.Ed. 907 (1938); Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. United States, 319 U.S. 598, 63 S.Ct. 1284, 87 L.Ed. 1612 (1943); and Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Texas Co., 336 U.S. 342, 69 S.Ct. 561, 93 L.Ed. 721 (1949), where the Court cut to the bone the proposition that restricted Indian lands and the proceeds from them were\u2014as a matter of constitutional law\u2014automatically exempt from state taxation. Rather, the Court held that Congress has the power 'to immunize these lessees from the taxes we think the Constitution permits Oklahoma to impose in the absence of such action' and that '(t)he question whether immunity shall be extended in situations like these is essentially legislative in character.' Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Texas Co., supra, at 365\u2014366, 69 S.Ct., at 574.\n\n\n8\nThe Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 neither requires nor counsels us to recognize this tribal business venture as a federal instrumentality. Congress itself felt it necessary to address the immunity question and to provide tax immunity to the extent it deemed desirable. There is, therefore, no statutory invitation to consider projects undertaken pursuant to the Act as federal instrumentalities generally and automatically immune from state taxation. Unquestionably, the Act reflected a new policy of the Federal Government and aimed to put a halt to the loss of tribal lands through allotment. It gave the Secretary of the Interior power to create new reservations, and tribes were encouraged to revitalize their self-government through the adoption of constitutions and bylaws and through the creation of chartered corporations, with power to conduct the business and economic affairs of the tribe.6 As was true in the case before us, a tribe taking advantage of the Act might generate substantial revenues for the education and the social and economic welfare of its people.7 So viewed, an enterprise such as the ski resort in this case serves a federal function with respect to the Government's role in Indian affairs. But the 'mere fact that property is used, among others, by the United States as an instrument for effecting its purpose does not relieve it from state taxation.' Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf R. Co. v. Mackey, 256 U.S. 531, 536, 41 S.Ct. 582, 583, 65 L.Ed. 1076 (1921). See also Henderson Bridge Co. v. Kentucky, 166 U.S. 150, 154, 17 S.Ct. 532, 533, 41 L.Ed. 953 (1897).\n\n\n9\nThe intent and purpose of the Reorganization Act was 'to rehabilitate the Indian's economic life and to give him a chance to develop the initiative destroyed by a century of oppression and paternalism.' H.R.Rep.No.1804, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 6 (1934). See also S.Rep.No.1080, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1934). As Senator Wheeler, on the floor, put it:\n\n\n10\n'This bill . . . seeks to get away from the bureaucratic      control of the Indian Department, and it seeks further to      give the Indians the control of their own affairs and of      their own property; to put it in the hands either of an      Indian council or in the hands of a corporation to be      organized by the Indians.' 78 Cong.Rec. 11125.\n\nRepresentative Howard explained that:\n\n11\n'The program of self-support and of business and civic      experience in the management of their own affairs, combined      with the program of education, will permit increasing numbers      of Indians to enter the white world on a footing of equal      competition.' Id., at 11732.8\n\n\n12\nThe Reorganization Act did not strip Indian tribes and their reservation lands of their historic immunity from state and local control.9 But, in the context of the Reorganization Act, we think it unrealistic to conclude that Congress conceived of off-reservation tribal enterprises 'virtually as an arm of the Government.' Department of Employment v. United States, 385 U.S. 355, 359\u2014360, 87 S.Ct. 464, 467, 17 L.Ed.2d 414 (1966). Cf. Clallam County v. United States, 263 U.S. 341, 44 S.Ct. 121, 68 L.Ed. 328 (1923). On the contrary, the aim was to disentangle the tribes from the official bureaucracy. The Court's decision in Organized Village of Kake, supra, which involved tribes organized under the Reorganization Act, demonstrates that off-reservation activities are within the reach of state law. See also Puyallup Tribe, 391 U.S., at 398, 88 S.Ct., at 1728. What was said in Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., 276 U.S. 575, 48 S.Ct. 333, 72 L.Ed. 709 (1928), is relevant here. At issue there was the taxability of off-reservation Indian land purchased with consent of the Secretary of the Interior with the accumulated royalties from the individual Indian's restricted allotted lands. Alienation of the purchased land was federally restricted. In rejecting a claim that state taxation of the land was barred by the federal-instrumentality doctrine,10 the then Mr. Justice Stone wrote for a unanimous Court:\n\n\n13\n'What governmental instrumentalities will be held free from      state taxation, though Congress has not expressly so      provided, cannot be determined apart from the purpose and      character of the legislation creating them. . . .\n\n\n14\n* * * * * *\n\n\n15\n'The early legislation affecting the Indians had as its      immediate object the closest control by the government of      their lives and property. The first and principal need then      was that they should be shielded alike from their own      improvidence and the spoliation of others but the ultimate      purpose was to give them the more independent and responsible      status of citizens and property owners.. . .\n\n\n16\n* * * * * *\n\n\n17\n'In a broad sense all lands which the Indians are permitted      to purchase out of the taxable lands of the state in this      process of their emancipation and assumption of the      responsibility of citizenship, whether restricted or not, may      be said to be instrumentalities in that process. But . . .      (t)o hold them immune would be inconsistent with one of the very purposes of their creation, to educate the Indians in      responsibility . . ..' Id., at 578\u2014581, 48 S.Ct., at 335.\n\n\n18\nWe accordingly decline the invitation to resurrect the expansive version of the intergovernmental-immunity doctrine that has been so consistently rejected in modern times.\n\nII\n\n19\nThe Tribe's broad claims of tax immunity must therefore be rejected. But there remains to be considered the scope of the immunity specifically afforded by \u00a7 5 of the Indian Reorganization Act. 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 465.\n\nA.\n\n20\nSection 465 provides, in part, that 'any lands or rights acquired' pursuant to any provision of the Act 'shall be taken in the name of the United States in trust for the Indian tribe or individual Indian for which the land is acquired, and such lands or rights shall be exempt from State and local taxation.'11 On its face, the statute exempts land and rights in land, not income derived from its use. It is true that a statutory tax exemption for 'lands' may, in light of its context and purposes, be construed to support an exemption for taxation on income derived from the land. See Squire v. Capoeman, 351 U.S. 1, 76 S.Ct. 611, 100 L.Ed. 883 (1956); cf. Superior Bath House Co. v. McCarroll, 312 U.S. 176, 61 S.Ct. 503, 85 L.Ed. 721 (1941).12 But, absent clear statutory guidance, courts ordinarily will not imply tax exemptions and will not exempt off-reservation income from tax simply because the land from which it is derived, or its other source, is itself exempt from tax.\n\n\n21\n'This Court has repeatedly said that tax exemptions are not granted by implication. . . . It has applied that rule to taxing acts affecting Indians as to all others. . . . If Congress intends to prevent the State of Oklahoma from levying a general non-discriminatory estate tax applying alike to all its citizens, it should say so in plain words. Such a conclusion can not rest on dubious inferences.' Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. United States, 319 U.S., at 606\u2014607, 63 S.Ct., at 1288. See Squire v. Capoeman, supra, 351 U.S., at 6, 76 S.Ct., at 614. Absent a 'definitely expressed' exemption, an Indian's royalty income from Indian oil lands is subject to the federal income tax although the source of the income may be exempt from tax. Choteau v. Burnet, 283 U.S. 691, 696\u2014697, 51 S.Ct. 598, 600\u2014601, 75 L.Ed. 1353 (1931). The Court has also held that a State, as well as the Federal Government, may tax an Indian's pro rata share of income from a tribe's restricted mineral resources. Leahy v. State Treasurer, 297 U.S. 420, 56 S.Ct. 507, 80 L.Ed. 771 (1936). Lessees of otherwise exempt Indian lands are also subject to state taxation. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Texas Co., 336 U.S. 342, 69 S.Ct. 561, 93 L.Ed. 721 (1949).\n\n\n22\nOn the face of \u00a7 465, therefore, there is no reason to hold that it forbids income as well as property taxes. Nor does the legislative history support any other conclusion. As we have noted, several explicit provisions encompassing a broad tax immunity for chartered Indian communities were dropped from the bills that preceded the Wheeler-Howard bill. See n. 9, supra. Similarly, the predecessor to the exemption embodied in \u00a7 465 dealt only with lands acquired for new reservations or for additions to existing reservations. 1934 House Hearings 11. Here, the rights and land were acquired by the Tribe beyond its reservation borders for the purpose of carrying on a business enterprise as anticipated by \u00a7\u00a7 476 and 477 of the Act.13 These provisions were designed to encourage tribal enterprises 'to enter the white world on a footing of equal competition.' 78 Cong.Rec. 11732. In this context, we will not imply an expansive immunity from ordinary income taxes that businesses throughout the State are subject to. We therefore hold that the exemption in \u00a7 465 does not encompass or bar the collection of New Mexico's nondiscriminatory gross receipts tax and that the Tribe's ski resort is subject to that tax.\n\nB\n\n23\nWe reach a different condlusion with respect to the compensating use tax imposed on the personalty installed in the construction of the ski lifts. According to the Stipulation of Facts, that personal property has been 'permanently attached to the realty.' In view of \u00a7 465, these permanent improvements on the Tribe's tax-exempt land would certainly be immune from the State's ad valorem property tax. See United States v. Rickert, 188 U.S. 432, 441\u2014443, 23 S.Ct. 478, 481\u2014482, 47 L.Ed. 532 (1903). We think the same immunity extends to the compensating use tax on the property. The jurisdictional basis for use taxes is the use of the property in the State. See Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., 300 U.S. 577, 57 S.Ct. 524, 81 L.Ed. 814 (1937); McLeod v. J. E. Dilworth Co., 322 U.S. 327, 330, 64 S.Ct. 1023, 1025, 88 L.Ed. 1304 (1944). It has long been recognized that 'use' is among the 'bundle of privileges that make up property or ownership' of property and, in this sense, at least, a tax upon 'use' is a tax upon the property itself. Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., supra, 300 U.S., at 582, 57 S.Ct., at 527. This is not to say that use taxes are for all purposes to be deemed simple ad valorem property taxes. See, e.g., United States v. City of Detroit, 355 U.S. 466, 78 S.Ct. 474, 2 L.Ed.2d 424 (1958), and its companion cases; Sullivan v. United States, 395 U.S. 169, 89 S.Ct. 1648, 23 L.Ed.2d 182 (1969). But use of permanent improvements upon land is so intimately connected with use of the land itself that an explicit provision relieving the latter of state tax burdens must be construed to encompass an exemption for the former. 'Every reason that can be urged to show that the land was not subject to local taxation applies to the assessment and taxation of the permanent improvements.' United States v. Rickert, supra, 188 U.S., at 442, 23 S.Ct., at 482.\n\n\n24\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\n\n25\nAffirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\n\n26\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice STEWART concur, dissenting in part.\n\n\n27\nThe power of Congress granted by Art. I, \u00a7 8 '(t)o regulate Commerce . . . with the Indian Tribes' is an exceedingly broad one. In the liquor cases the Court held that it reached acts even off Indian reservations in areas normally subject to the police power of the States. Perrin v. United States, 232 U.S. 478, 34 S.Ct. 387, 58 L.Ed. 691. The power gained breadth by reason of historic experiences that induced Congress to treat Indians as wards of the Nation. See Gritts v. Fisher, 224 U.S. 640, 642\u2014643, 32 S.Ct. 580, 581, 56 L.Ed. 928; United States v. Thomas, 151 U.S. 577, 585, 14 S.Ct. 426, 429, 38 L.Ed. 276; United States v. McGowan, 302 U.S. 535, 538, 58 S.Ct. 286, 287, 82 L.Ed. 410. The laws enacted by Congress varied from decade to decade. See U.S.Dept. of the Interior, Federal Indian Law 94\u2014138 (1958), which is a revision of the monumental work, Handbook of Federal Indian Law prepared by Felix S. Cohen and published in 1940.\n\n\n28\nThe present Act, 48 Stat. 984, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 461 et seq., was enacted in 1934 with various purposes in mind, the ones most relevant being, first, '(t)o permit Indian tribes to equip themselves with the devices of modern business organization, through forming themselves into business corporations,' and second, '(t)o establish a system of financial credit for Indians.' S.Rep.No.1080, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 1.\n\n\n29\nLoans had been made by the federal agency to individual Indians, but the experience had not been satisfactory. Id., at 3 4. The 1934 Act precluded such loans and set up a $10 million revolving-credit fund for loans to incorporated tribes. The industry established pursuant to that Act and involved here is a ski enterprise, adjacent to the reservation and located on lands leased from the U.S. Forest Service.\n\n\n30\nThe Court makes much of the fact that the ski enterprise is not on the reservation. But that seems irrelevant to me by reason of \u00a7 5 of the Act, which provides in part that 'any lands or rights acquired' pursuant to the 1934 Act 'shall be taken in the name of the United States in trust for the Indian tribe . . . for which the land is acquired, and such lands or rights shall be exempt from State and local taxation.' 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 465. While the lease of Forest Service lands was not technically 'acquired . . . in trust for the Indian tribe,' the Court concedes that the lease arrangement was sufficient to bring the Tribe's interest in the land within the immunity afforded by \u00a7 465. And so the question respecting income taxes comes down to whether these taxes are within the scope of 'such lands or rights' as used in \u00a7 5.\n\n\n31\nI start from the premise made explicit in the Senate Report on the 1934 Act. It set forth the endorsement by President Roosevelt of 'a new standard of dealing between the Federal Government and its Indian wards.' S.Rep., supra, at 3. Article 10 of the 1852 Treaty with the Apaches described the role of the guardian as respects these wards: 'For and in consideration of the faithful performance of all the stipulations herein contained, by the said Apache's Indians, the government of the United States will grant to said Indians such donations, presents, and implements, and adopt such other liberal and humane measures as said government may deem meet and proper.' 10 Stat. 980.\n\n\n32\nThe 1934 Act obviously is an effort by Congress to extend its control to Indian economic activities outside the reservation for the benefit of its Indian wards. The philosophy permeating the present Act was articulated by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 556, 8 L.Ed. 483: 'From the commencement of our government, Congress has passed acts to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indians; which treat them as nations, respect their rights, and manifest a firm purpose to afford that protection which treaties stipulate.'\n\n\n33\nAs noted in Warren Trading Post v. Tax Comm'n, 380 U.S. 685, 85 S.Ct. 1242, 14 L.Ed.2d 165, most tax immunities of Indians have related to activities on reservations. But, as we stated in that case, the fact that the activities occurred on a reservation was not the controlling reason, 'but rather because Congress in the exercise of its power granted in Art. I, \u00a7 8, has undertaken to regulate reservation trading in such a comprehensive way that there is no room for the States to legislate on the subject.' Id., at 691 n. 18, 85 S.Ct., at 1246.\n\n\n34\nThe powers of Congress 'over Indian affairs are as wide as State powers over non-Indians,' subject, of course, to the limitations of the Bill of Rights. Federal Indian Law 24. One illustration of its extent is shown by the liquor cases already cited. We deal here, however, with 'tribal property'\u2014a leasehold interest in federal lands adjoining the reservation. 'The term tribal property . . . does not designate a single and definite legal institution, but rather a broad range within which important variations exist.' Federal Indian Law 590\u2014591. There is no magic in the word 'reservation.' United States v. McGowan, supra, held that land purchased by Congress for a tribe but outside a 'reservation' was nonetheless 'Indian country.' While that case involved application of liquor laws, the Court stated that 'Congress alone has the right to determine the manner in which this country's guardianship over the Indians shall be carried out,' id., at 538, 58 S.Ct., at 287, and that it was immaterial what the tract of land was called. Id., at 539, 58 S.Ct., at 288.\n\n\n35\nIn the present case, Congress has attempted to give this tribe an economic base which offers job opportunities, a higher standard of living, community stability, preservation of Indian culture, and the orientation of the tribe to commercial maturity. We deal only with a tribal-developed enterprise. State taxation of that enterprise interferes with the federal project. The ski resort, being a federal tool to aid the tribe, may not be taxed by the State without the consent of Congress. Congress by \u00a7 5 of the Act has made the 'lands or rights' acquired for the tribe exempt from state and local taxation. Section 5, indeed, states that 'lands or rights' acquired under the 1934 Act shall be held 'in trust for the Indian tribe or individual Indian for which the land is acquired.' There is no more convincing way to tax 'rights' in land than to impose an income tax on the gross or net income from those rights. If \u00a7 5 be thought to be ambiguous, we should resolve the ambiguity in favor of the tribe. As stated in Carpenter v. Shaw, 280 U.S. 363, 367, 50 S.Ct. 121, 122, 74 L.Ed. 478, 'Doubtful expressions are to be resolved in favor of the weak and defenseless people who are the wards of the nation, dependent upon its protection and good faith.' In Squire v. Capoeman, 351 U.S. 1, 76 S.Ct. 611, 100 L.Ed. 883, we resolved doubts respecting the federal income tax in favor of the Indian. There is the same reason for taking that course here.\n\n\n36\nThe tribal ski enterprise, unlike the private entrepreneur in Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U.S. 376, 58 S.Ct. 623, 82 L.Ed. 907, on which the Court relies, is plainly a federal instrumentality\u2014authorized and financed by Congress with the aim of starting the tribe on commercial ventures. This case has no relation to Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. United States, 319 U.S. 598, 63 S.Ct. 1284, 87 L.Ed. 1612, which raised the question whether state inheritance taxes could be levied on restricted property. The Court only held that restricted property, as created by Congress, carried no implication of estate tax exemption. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Texas Co., 336 U.S. 342, 69 S.Ct. 561, 93 L.Ed. 721, also relied on by the Court, merely held that a lessee of mineral rights in Indian lands was not immunized from paying state gross production taxes and state excise taxes on petroleum produced from the lands. Those cases would be relevant here if the tribe had leased the ski resort to an outsider who sought the tribal tax immunity. We deal only with an income tax levied on a tribal corporate enterprise conducted by the tribe with federal funds on federal lands leased to the tribe. Federal Indian Law distinguished the Helvering and like cases relied on by the Court from an enterprise 'organized solely to carry out governmental objectives, such as the tribal corporations organized' under the 1934 Act with which we now deal id., at 852 853.\n\n\n37\nIn my view, this state income tax is barred by \u00a7 5 through which Congress has given tax immunity to these new tribal enterprises.\n\n\n\n1\n In 1936, the Tribe adopted a constitution, pursuant to \u00a7 16 of the Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 476.\n\n\n2\n The Tribe asserts that 'no sales tax (gross receipts tax) is being . . . charged for any ski rentals, lift tickets, food or beverages.'\n\n\n3\n Brief for Petitioner 16.\n\n\n4\n A corresponding provision appears in the Constitution of the State of New Mexico, Art. XXI, \u00a7 2.\n\n\n5\n The Tribe's treaty with the United States, 10 Stat. 979, which acknowledges that the Tribe is 'exclusively under the laws, jurisdiction, and government of the United States . . .,' does not alter the obvious effect of the State's admission legislation. See, e.g., Organized Village of Kake v. Egan, 369 U.S. 60, 67\u201468, 82 S.Ct. 562, 566\u2014567, 7 L.Ed.2d 573 (1962), and cases cited therein.\n\n\n6\n See generally U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Federal Indian Law 129\u2014132 (1958), a revision of Handbook of Federal Indian Law, prepared under the editorial direction of Felix S. Cohen, first printed in 1940 (hereinafter Federal Indian Law); Comment, Tribal Self-Government and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 70 Mich.L.Rev. 955 (1972).\n\n\n7\n For other examples see Comment, n. 6 supra, at 983\u2014985. See also J. Collier, On the Gleaming Way 149, 129\u2014149 (1962).\n\n\n8\n See also id., at 11727, 11731\u201411732 (remarks of Rep. Howard); the statements of Mr. John Collier, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in Hearings on H.R. 7902, before the House Committee on Indian Affairs, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 37, 60, 65\u201467 (1934) (hereinafter 1934 House Hearings).\n\n\n9\n The predecessor bills to the Wheeler-Howard Act, H.R. 7902 and S. 2755 (respectively 78 Cong.Rec. 2437 and 2440), expressly provided that the chartered Indian communities may act 'as a Federal agency in the administration of Indian Affairs,' and, correspondingly, that the United States would not 'be liable for any act done . . . by a chartered Indian community.' Title I,\n\u00a7 4(i). 1934 House Hearings 3. The bills further provided that: 'Nothing in this Act shall be construed as rendering the property of any Indian community . . . subject to taxation by any State or subdivision thereof . . ..' Tit. I, \u00a7 11. Id., at 5. The memorandum of John Collier, which accompanied the bills, stated that '(a)s a Federal agency, the property of a chartered community is constitutionally exempt from State taxation . . ..' Id., at 25. These extensive provisions for tax immunity were discarded in the Wheeler-Howard Act, along with the accompanying provisions for more extensive governmental powers on the part of the chartered communities. See H.R.Rep. No. 1804, supra, at 6. We do not read this legislative history, however, as suggesting that Congress intended to remove the traditional tax immunity that Indian tribes enjoyed on their reservations. This reading finds support in Felix S. Cohen's treatise, see Federal Indian Law 852\u2014853, although we believe that the broader thrust of his statement\u2014that any 'attempt by a State to impose income or other types of taxes' upon 'tribal corporations organized under the Indian Reorganization Act . . . would still be held a direct burden on a Federal instrumentality' is not supported by the modern cases and should be read with and in the light of other discussions of the immunity doctrine in particularized contexts. See id., at 872\u2014873, 864\u2014873.\n\n\n10\n The claim of tax immunity was made by a non-Indian lessee, under the rule of Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U.S. 501, 42 S.Ct. 171, 66 L.Ed. 338 (1922), which was itself overruled in Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Texas Co., 336 U.S. 342, 69 S.Ct. 561, 93 L.Ed. 721 (1949), over two decades after Shaw. As a decision with respect to constitutionally mandated intergovernmental immunity, Shaw remains good law, although its result was altered by statute, as Congress was free to do. See generally Board of County Comm'rs v. Seber, 318 U.S. 705, 63 S.Ct. 920, 87 L.Ed. 1094 (1943).\n\n\n11\n The ski resort land was not technically 'acquired' 'in trust for the Indian tribe.' But, as the Solicitor General has pointed out, 'it would have been meaningless for the United States, which already had title to the forest, to convey title to itself for the use of the Tribe.' Brief for the United States as amicus curiae 13. We think the lease arrangement here in question was sufficient to bring the Tribe's interest in the land within the immunity afforded by \u00a7 465. It should perhaps be noted that the Tribe has not suggested that it is immune from taxation by virtue of its status as a lessee of land owned by the Federal Government. See, e.g., United States v. City of Detroit, 355 U.S. 466, 78 S.Ct. 474, 2 L.Ed.2d 424 (1958); James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U.S. 134, 58 S.Ct. 208, 82 L.Ed. 155 (1937); cf. Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U.S. 376, 58 S.Ct. 623, 82 L.Ed. 907 (1938); Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Texas Co., supra.\n\n\n12\n Squire v. Capoeman involved the attempted imposition of federal capital gains taxes on the sale price of timber logged off allotted Indian timberland (located within a reservation). The timber constituted 'the major value'\u2014if not the only practical value\u2014of the Indian's allotted land and it was clear that if the capital gains tax was to apply, the purposes and intent of the General Allotment Act of 1887 would in large measure have been frustrated. Id., 351 U.S., at 10, 76 S.Ct., at 617. The Court, relying in part on 'relatively contemporaneous official and unofficial writings' on the intended scope of the income tax laws, 351 U.S., at 9, 76 S.Ct., at 616, declined to so interpret those later enacted laws and to find that the Government intended to tax its own ward in this particular manner. In contrast to Squire, we find nothing fundamentally inconsistent with the intent of the Indian Reorganization Act in permitting the gross receipts of the Tribe's off-reservation enterprise to be subject to nondiscriminatory state taxes.\n\n\n13\n It is unclear from the record whether the Tribe has actually incorporated itself as an Indian chartered corporation pursuant to \u00a7 477. But see Charters, Constitutions and By-Laws of the Indian Tribes of North America, pt. III, pp. 13\u201415 (G. Fay ed. 1967). The Tribe's constitution, however, adopted under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 476, gives its Tribal Council the powers that would ordinarily be held by such a corporation, Art. XI, and by both practice and regulations, the two entities have apparently merged in important respects. See 25 CFR \u00a7 91.2; Comment, n. 6, supra, at 973. In any event, the question of tax immunity cannot be made to turn on the particular form in which the Tribe chooses to conduct its business.\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"448 U.S. 725\n100 S.Ct. 2905\n65 L.Ed.2d 1086\nWilliam Jack HAMMETTv.State of TEXAS.\nNo. 79-5050.\nJuly 2, 1980.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nWilliam Jack Hammett, the petitioner in this case, has been convicted of murder and sentenced to death.  The conviction and sentence were affirmed by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, 578 S.W.2d 699 (1979).  The petitioner states, and his attorney does not deny, that he informed his counsel that he did not wish to pursue any further appeals in his case.  Nevertheless, counsel filed a petition requesting review by this Court.\n\n\n2\nPetitioner now moves for dismissal of the petition, stating under oath that he \"made this decision voluntarily and with full knowledge of the consequences, only after due consideration of all facts and circumstances regarding the case.\"  Affidavit of June 3, 1980.  Under Rule 60 of the Rules of the Supreme Court (1970), a petitioner or appellant may withdraw a petition or appeal.  In response to this motion, petitioner's counsel does not question petitioner's competence.  The State of Texas does not oppose petitioner's motion.  In the absence of any issue as to petitioner's competence to withdraw the petition filed against his will, there is no basis under Rule 60 for denying this motion. See Gilmore v. Utah, 429 U.S. 1012, 1014, 97 S.Ct. 436, 437, 50 L.Ed.2d 632 (1976) (BURGER, C. J., concurring).  Moreover, withdrawal of the petition will not foreclose an appropriate application for collateral relief.  Accordingly, the motion to withdraw the petition is granted.\n\n\n3\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n4\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting.\n\n\n5\nThe Court today permits petitioner, a prisoner acting pro se, to take the first step towards enforcement of his death sentence by withdrawing the petition for writ of certiorari filed on his behalf by his appointed counsel.  I continue to adhere to my view that the death penalty is unconstitutional under all circumstances, and accordingly I dissent.  In addition, however, the present decision is indefensible even under the more restrictive view of the Eighth Amendment taken by a majority of my Brethren.\n\n\n6\nThe Court takes its action today despite the fact that we have already granted certiorari in a similar case to determine whether the Constitution is violated by the manner in which the State of Texas acquires psychiatric testimony introduced at the punishment phase of the trial to obtain a jury verdict setting the punishment at death.  Estelle v. Smith, 445 U.S. 926, 100 S.Ct. 1311, 63 L.Ed.2d 758 (1980).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has already held that the established pattern of conduct by which the State of Texas obtains the testimony necessary to send a defendant to his death violates the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments.  Smith v. Estelle, 602 F.2d 694 (1979).  Thus the Court today acquiesces in the petitioner's apparent decision to be executed despite the fact that we may hold next Term that the death penalty cannot be enforced in cases such as this one.  I do not believe that a defendant may by his consent permit a State to impose a punishment forbidden by the Constitution;  \"the procedure the Court approves today amounts to nothing less than state-administered suicide.\" Lenhard v. Wolff, 444 U.S. 807, 815, 100 S.Ct. 29, 62 L.Ed.2d 20 (1979) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).\n\n\n7\n* A few facts about this case must be briefly stated in order to place the present motion in its proper context.  Petitioner was originally tried for capital murder in the spring of 1977. Although the jury found the defendant guilty of capital murder, a mistrial was declared after the jury was unable to agree on the punishment during the sentencing phase of the trial.  See 578 S.W.2d 699, 706 (Tex.Cr.App.1979).  The second trial was held in the fall of 1977, and petitioner was again found guilty of capital murder.  The jury answered the requisite questions in the affirmative, and the punishment was therefore assessed at death.1\n\n\n8\nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals initially reversed the judgment of the trial court.  See App. to Pet. for Cert., Exhibit A.  The Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that it was error to deny petitioner's motion for appointment of a psychologist to examine petitioner for the purpose of testifying on his behalf concerning the probability that petitioner would commit future criminal acts of violence.2  On the State's motion for rehearing, however, that opinion was withdrawn and the court affirmed the conviction and sentence.  578 S.W.2d 699 (1979).  The court concluded that petitioner's motion for appointment of a defense psychologist had been made too late.\n\n\n9\nThe central issue raised by the petition for certiorari in this case concerns the use of psychiatric testimony during the punishment stage of a Texas capital case.3  Prior to the first trial, the court appointed Dr. Bill W. Henry, a psychiatrist, to examine petitioner to determine his mental competency to stand trial.  Dr. Henry filed two written reports with the court, based on two interviews with petitioner, concluding that the defendant was competent to stand trial.  Counsel apparently was not present at either interview.  Cf. id., at 705.  No issue of competency was raised during the guilt phase of either of petitioner's trials.\n\n\n10\nAt the punishment stage of each trial, however, the State was permitted to call Dr. Henry as an expert witness.  The State examined Dr. Henry on whether there was a probability that the petitioner would commit criminal acts of violence in the future that would constitute a continuing threat to society.  That issue is, of course, one of the statutorily required questions which must be presented to the jury in the sentencing phase of a Texas capital case;  if the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that such a probability of future violent crime exists, in addition to the other statutorily mandated findings, then the death penalty must be imposed.4  Based on the pretrial psychiatric examinations which were supposedly limited to the question whether the petitioner was legally competent to stand trial, Dr. Henry testified that the defendant was a \"person suffering of an antisocial personality,\" id., at 706, and that petitioner would probably commit criminal acts of violence in the future.\n\nII\n\n11\nIt has become clear that the scenario just described constitutes a customary pattern of conduct by the authorities in Texas capital cases.  This is by no means the first time that a pretrial examination allegedly sought only to ascertain the defendant's competence to stand trial has been used as the basis for punishment-stage testimony by the court-appointed psychiatrist that the defendant has an antisocial personality and is likely to commit future violent crimes.  The cases in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reflecting this pattern of official conduct are legion.  See, e. g., Wilder v. State, 583 S.W.2d 349 (1979), cert. pending, No. 79-5002;  Armour v. State, 583 S.W.2d 349 (1979), cert. pending, No. 79-5007;  Bell v. State, 582 S.W.2d 800 (1979), cert. pending No. 79-5199;  Garcia v. State, 581 S.W.2d 168 (1979), cert. pending, No. 79-5464;  Woods v. State, 569 S.W.2d 901 (1978), cert. pending, No. 79-721;  Livingston v. State, 542 S.W.2d 655 (1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 933, 97 S.Ct. 2642, 53 L.Ed.2d 250 (1979);  Gholson v. State, 542 S.W.2d 395 (1976), cert. denied, 432 U.S. 911, 97 S.Ct. 2960, 53 L.Ed.2d 1084 (1977);  Smith v. State, 540 S.W.2d 693 (1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 922, 97 S.Ct. 1341, 51 L.Ed.2d 601 (1977), death penalty vacated, Smith v. Estelle, 445 F.Supp. 647 (N.D.Tex.1977), aff'd, 602 F.2d 694 (CA5 1979), cert. granted, 445 U.S. 926, 100 S.Ct. 1311, 63 L.Ed.2d 758 (1980);  Hurd v. State, 513 S.W.2d 936 (1974);  Armstrong v. State, 502 S.W.2d 731 (1973).  The use at the punishment stage of testimony by the psychiatrist appointed by the court to establish the defendant's competency to stand trial has the official sanction of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.  See Armour v. State, supra;  Livingston v. State, supra;  Gholson v. State, supra.\n\n\n12\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has concluded that this practice violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendments as made applicable to the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Smith v. Estelle, 602 F.2d 694 (1979), aff'g 445 F.Supp. 647 (N.D.Tex.1977).  The Court of Appeals held that \"a defendant may not be compelled to speak to a psychiatrist who can use his statements against him at the sentencing phase of a capital trial,\" 602 F.2d, at 708, that the defendant must be warned that he has the right to remain silent, and that if a defendant indicates that he wishes to remain silent he may not be questioned by the psychiatrist to determine future dangerousness, ibid.5  That court also found that whether to submit to a pretrial psychiatric examination in a Texas capital case \"is a vitally important decision, literally a life or death matter,\" ibid.  The examination is therefore a critical stage in the prosecution, and the defendant is entitled to the assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment.  Id., at 708-709.\n\n\n13\nBecause of the seriousness of the issues raised and the conflict between the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, we have already granted certiorari in Estelle v. Smith, 445 U.S. 926, 100 S.Ct. 1311, 63 L.Ed.2d 758 (1980).  Should this Court agree with the federal court, the death penalty imposed on petitioner in the instant case would have to be reconsidered because of the manner in which the crucial psychiatric testimony against him was obtained.\n\n\n14\nNevertheless, the Court today permits petitioner, acting pro se, to withdraw his petition for certiorari, thereby setting in motion the steps by which the defendant may be put to death by the State of Texas.6  It appears that petitioner does not intend to prosecute any challenge to his conviction and sentence;7 petitioner asks this Court to permit him to withdraw his petition for certiorari \"so that the [death] sentence may be carried out.\"  Motion to Dismiss 2.  Petitioner in effect seeks to waive a challenge to his execution,8 despite the fact that the issue of the constitutionality of the practice by which he was sentenced to die is presently pending before this Court.  In my judgment, there can be no such waiver.  See Lenhard v. Wolff, 444 U.S., at 810, 100 S.Ct., at 30 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting);  Gilmore v. Utah, 429 U.S. 1012, 1019, 97 S.Ct. 436, 440, 50 L.Ed.2d 632 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).\n\n\n15\nIn Gilmore, Mr. Justice WHITE, joined by Mr. Justice BRENNAN and myself, asserted that \"the consent of a convicted defendant in a criminal case does not privilege a State to impose a punishment otherwise forbidden by the Eighth Amendment.\"  Id., at 1018, 97 S.Ct., at 439 (dissenting opinion).  In a separate dissenting opinion, I expressed the view that \"the Eighth Amendment not only protects the rights of individuals not to be victims of cruel and unusual punishment, but that it also expresses a fundamental interest of society in ensuring that state authority is not used to administer barbaric punishments.\"  Id., at 1019, 97 S.Ct., at 440 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  \"Society is not powerless  . . . to resist a defendant's effort to prompt the exercise of capital force,\" Lenhard v. Wolff, supra, 444 U.S., at 812, 100 S.Ct., at 31 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  The defendant has no right to \"state-administered suicide.\"  444 U.S., at 815, 100 S.Ct., at 33.\n\n\n16\nThese observations have no less force because here the imposition of the death penalty under these circumstances may be held by a majority of my Brethren to violate the Fifth and Sixth Amendments rather than the Eighth Amendment.  Indeed, these views have added force in this case because the procedure employed by the State has been successfully challenged on constitutional grounds in federal court, and the issue of the constitutionality of the manner in which the State obtains the psychiatric testimony necessary to convince the jury that the defendant will probably commit acts of criminal violence in the future is presently pending before this Court.  Cf. Gilmore v. Utah, 429 U.S., at 1018, 97 S.Ct., at 439 (WHITE, J., dissenting);  id., at 1019, 97 S.Ct., at 440 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting);  Lenhard v. Wolff, supra, 807 U.S., at 811-812, n.3, 100 S.Ct., at 31 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).\n\n\n17\nIf this Court agrees with the Court of Appeals in Estelle v. Smith, then the death penalty imposed on petitioner in the present case must be reconsidered.  Under these circumstances I cannot accept the Court's decision to permit the petitioner to withdraw his petition for certiorari and thereby run the risk that the State of Texas will take a life which it is constitutionally prohibited from taking.  I dissent.\n\n\n18\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN, dissenting.\n\n\n19\nI would not grant this pro se application summarily, but would set it for plenary consideration upon briefs and arguments submitted by petitioner's appointed counsel and the State.  See Gilmore v. Utah, 429 U.S. 1012, 1020, 97 S.Ct. 436, 440, 50 L.Ed.2d 632 (1976) (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n\n1\n By state statute the jury in a capital case in Texas must decide three questions:\n\"(1) whether the conduct of the defendant that caused the death of the deceased was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased or another would result;\n\"(2) whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society;  and\n\"(3) if raised by the evidence, whether the conduct of the defendant in killing the deceased was unreasonable in response to the provocation, if any, by the deceased.\"  Tex.Code Crim.Proc.Ann., Art. 37.071(b) (Vernon Supp. 1979).  An affirmative answer to each question must be unanimous, and if all three questions are answered affirmatively then the death penalty \"shall\" be imposed.  Tex.Code Crim.Proc.Ann., Arts. 37.071(d)(1) and (e) (Vernon Supp. 1979).\n\n\n2\n The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reasoned:\n\"Those who face an accusation of being likely to commit criminal acts of violence that will constitute a continuing threat to society face a peculiarly unique charge with ominous consequences.  In this jurisdiction the use of the expert opinion testimony of those in the behavioral sciences has frequently been resorted to by the prosecution, and this Court has consistently approved such use, often basing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a death-producing verdict on that evidence.  . . .  Given the role such evidence has come to play, the unique character of the issue, the extreme consequences that rest on resolution of the issue, and the tremendous diversity of opinions on such matters within the field of experts that may qualify to give such evidence on the issue, it cannot be denied that for accused persons facing the possibility of death, expert behavioral witnesses for the defense are necessities, not luxuries.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert., Exhibit A, pp. 3-4.\nSee also 578 S.W.2d 699, 720-721 (Tex.Cr.App.1979) (Odom, J., concurring).\n\n\n3\n In the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals petitioner argued, inter alia, that \"the trial court erred in allowing a psychiatrist who was appointed to examine the [defendant] with respect to his competency to stand trial to testify at the punishment phase of the trial.\"  Id., at 705.  A similar argument is made in the petition for certiorari.  See, e. g., Pet. for Cert. 6-7:  \"[T]he circumstances surrounding the State's presentation of Dr. Henry's testimony at the punishment stage of trial was grossly unfair and the defendant was thus denied due process of law,\" citing Smith v. Estelle, 445 F.Supp. 647 (N.D.Tex.1977).  See also Pet. for Cert. 14-16, 17-18.\n\n\n4\n See n. 1, supra.\n\n\n5\n In the instant case there is evidence that in fact petitioner did not want to cooperate with Dr. Henry during the interview.  See 578 S.W.2d, at 705;  Brief in Opposition 4.\nThe State's response to the petition for certiorari alleges that Dr. Henry informed petitioner of his right not to participate and that the psychiatrist terminated the first interview after petitioner chose not to continue.  Ibid.  Even if that was the case, it does not necessarily mean that the procedure used in this case complies with the constitutional requirements discussed by the Court of Appeals in Smith v. Estelle and, of course, when this Court reviews that decision we may conclude that the Court of Appeals took an overly narrow view of the constitutional requirements.  If this Court affirms the judgment of the Court of Appeals in Estelle v. Smith, cert. granted, 445 U.S. 926, 100 S.Ct. 1311, 63 L.Ed.2d 758 (1980), at the very least the procedure by which Dr. Henry obtained the information from petitioner from which the psychiatrist derived his testimony would have to be closely scrutinized to see if it satisfied constitutional demands.\n\n\n6\n According to the State of Texas, if the petition for writ of certiorari is dismissed by this Court, the mandate would then issue from the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to the trial court. Petitioner would then be formally sentenced to be executed on a date 30 days or more from the date of sentencing.  Response to Motion to Dismiss 3.  See also Tex.Code Crim.Proc.Ann., Art. 43.14 (Vernon 1979).\n\n\n7\n Petitioner states that \"I no longer wish to appeal (or challenge) my conviction in this case.\"  Motion to Dismiss 1.  He also asks this Court \"to set aside this writ and issue an order so stating to the state court so that the sentence may be carried out.\"  Id., at 2.\n\n\n8\n It is questionable whether petitioner fully understands what he is seeking to waive.  In his papers petitioner \"moves the Court to dismiss the Appal [sic] or Habeas Corpus Application,\" id., at 1.  He does not appear to know whether his appointed attorney filed a petition for certiorari, an appeal, or a habeas corpus application.  Ibid.  It is certainly possible that petitioner has reached his present decision without full knowledge or understanding of the Court of Appeals decision in Smith v. Estelle, our grant of certiorari to review that decision, or the effect that Estelle v. Smith may have on his sentence of death. Cf. Gilmore v. Utah, 429 U.S. 1012, 1019, 97 S.Ct. 436, 440, 50 L.Ed.2d 632 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).\n\n\n","label":0}

BRACKER et al.\nNo. 78-1177.\nArgued Jan. 14, 1980.\nDecided June 27, 1980.\n\n\nSyllabus\n\nPursuant to a contract with an organization of petitioner White Mountain Apache Tribe, petitioner Pinetop Logging Co. (Pinetop), a non-Indian enterprise authorized to do business in Arizona, felled tribal timber on the Fort Apache Reservation and transported it to the tribal organization's sawmill.  Pinetop's activities were performed solely on the reservation.  Respondents, state agencies and members thereof, sought to impose on Pinetop Arizona's motor carrier license tax, which is assessed on the basis of the carrier's gross receipts, and its use fuel tax, which is assessed on the basis of diesel fuel used to propel a motor vehicle on any highway within the State.  Pinetop paid the taxes under protest and then brought suit in state court, asserting that under federal law the taxes could not lawfully be imposed on logging activities conducted exclusively within the reservation or on hauling activities on Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and tribal roads.  The trial court awarded summary judgment to respondents, and the Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed in pertinent part, rejecting petitioners' pre-emption claim.\nHeld :  The Arizona taxes are pre-empted by federal law.  Cf. Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 380 U.S. 685, 85 S.Ct. 1242, 14 L.Ed.2d 165.  Pp. 141-153.\n(a) The tradition of Indian sovereignty over the reservation and tribal members must inform the determination whether the exercise of state authority has been pre-empted by operation of federal law.  Where, as here, a State asserts authority over the conduct of non-Indians engaging in activity on the reservation, a particularized inquiry must be made into the nature of the state, federal, and tribal interests at stake, an inquiry designed to determine whether, in the specific context, the exercise of state authority would violate federal law.  Pp. 141-145.\n(b) The Federal Government's regulation of the harvesting, sale, and management of tribal timber, and of the BIA and tribal roads, is so pervasive as to preclude the additional burdens sought to be imposed here by assessing the taxes in question against Pinetop for operations that are conducted solely on BIA and tribal roads within the reservation.  Pp. 145-149.\n(c) Imposition of the taxes in question would undermine the federal policy of assuring that the profits from timber sales would inure to the Tribe's benefit;  would also undermine the Secretary of the Interior's ability to make the wide range of determinations committed to his authority concerning the setting of fees and rates with respect to the harvesting and sale of tribal timber; and would adversely affect the Tribe's ability to comply with the sustained-yield management policies imposed by federal law.  Pp. 149-150.\n(d) Respondents' generalized interest in raising revenue is insufficient, in the context of this case, to permit its proposed intrusion into the federal regulatory scheme with respect to the harvesting and sale of tribal timber.  P. 150.\n120 Ariz. 282, 585 P.2d 891, reversed.\nNeil Vincent Wake, Phoenix, Ariz., and Michael J. Brown, Tucson, Ariz., for petitioners.\nElinor H. Stillman, Washington, D.C., for the U.S., as amicus curiae, by special leave of the Court.\nIan A. Macpherson, Asst. Atty. Gen., Phoenix, Ariz., for respondents.\nMr. Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nIn this case we are once again called upon to consider the extent of state authority over the activities of non-Indians engaged in commerce on an Indian reservation.  The State of Arizona seeks to apply its motor carrier license and use fuel taxes to petitioner Pinetop Logging Co. (Pinetop), an enterprise consisting of two non-Indian corporations authorized to do business in Arizona and operating solely on the Fort Apache Reservation.  Pinetop and petitioner White Mountain Apache Tribe contend that the taxes are pre-empted by federal law or alternatively, that they represent an unlawful infringement on tribal self-government.  The Arizona Court of appeals rejected petitioners' claims.  We hold that the taxes are pre-empted by federal law, and we therefore reverse.\n\n\n2\n* The 6,500 members of petitioner White Mountain Apache Tribe reside on the Fort Apache Reservation in a mountainous and forested region of northeastern Arizona.1  The Tribe is organized under a constitution approved by the Secretary of the Interior under the Indian Reorganization Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 476.  The revenue used to fund the Tribe's governmental programs is derived almost exclusively from tribal enterprises.  Of these enterprises, timber operations have proved by far the most important, accounting for over 90% of the Tribe's total annual profits.2\n\n\n3\nThe Fort Apache Reservation occupies over 1,650,000 acres, including 720,000 acres of commercial forest.  Approximately 300,000 acres are used for the harvesting of timber on a \"sustained yield\" basis, permitting each area to be cut every 20 years without endangering the forest's continuing productivity. Under federal law, timber on reservation land is owned by the United States for the benefit of the Tribe and cannot be harvested for sale without the consent of Congress. Acting under the authority of 25 CFR \u00a7 141.6 (1979) and the tribal constitution, and with the specific approval of the Secretary of the Interior, the Tribe in 1964 organized the Fort Apache Timber Co. (FATCO), a tribal enterprise that manages, harvests, processes, and sells timber.  FATCO, which conducts all of its activities on the reservation, was created with the aid of federal funds.  It employs about 300 tribal members.\n\n\n4\nThe United States has entered into contracts with FATCO, authorizing it to harvest timber pursuant to regulations of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  FATCO has itself contracted with six logging companies, including Pinetop, which perform certain operations that FATCO could not carry out as economically on its own.3  Since it first entered into agreements with FATCO in 1969, Pinetop has been required to fell trees, cut them to the correct size, and transport them to FATCO's sawmill in return for a contractually specified fee.  Pinetop employs approximately 50 tribal members.  Its activities, performed solely on the Fort Apache Reservation, are subject to extensive federal control.\n\n\n5\nIn 1971 respondents4 sought to impose on Pinetop the two state taxes at issue here.  The first, a motor carrier license tax, is assessed on \"[e]very common motor carrier of property and every contract motor carrier of property.\"  Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 40-641(A)(1) (Supp.1979).  Pinetop is a \"contract motor carrier of property\" since it is engaged in \"the transportation by motor vehicle of property, for compensation, on any public highway.\"  \u00a7 40-601(A)(7) (1974).  The motor carrier license tax amounts to 2.5% of the carrier's gross receipts.  \u00a7 40-641(A)(1) (Supp.1979). The second tax at issue is an excise or use fuel tax designed \"[f]or the purpose of partially compensating the state for the use of its highways.\"  Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 28-1552 (Supp.1979).  The tax amounts to eight cents per gallon of fuel used \"in the propulsion of a motor vehicle on any highway within this state.\"  Ibid.  The used fuel tax was assessed on Pinetop because it uses diesel fuel to propel its vehicles on the state highways within the Fort Apache Reservation.\n\n\n6\nPinetop paid the taxes under protest,5 and then brought suit in state court, asserting that under federal law the taxes could not lawfully be imposed on logging activities conducted exclusively within the reservation or on hauling activities on Bureau of Indian Affairs and tribal roads.6  The Tribe agreed to reimburse Pinetop for any tax liability incurred as a result of its on-reservation business activities, and the Tribe intervened in the action as a plaintiff.7\n\n\n7\nBoth petitioners and respondents moved for summary judgment on the issue of the applicability of the two taxes to Pinetop. Petitioners submitted supporting affidavits from the manager of FATCO, the head forester of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Chairman of the White Mountain Apache Tribal Council;  respondents offered no affidavits disputing the factual assertions by petitioners' affiants.  The trial court awarded summary judgment to respondents,8 and the petitioners appealed to the Arizona Court of Appeals.  The Court of Appeals rejected petitioners' pre-emption claim.  120 Ariz. 282, 585 P.2d 891 (1978).  Purporting to apply the test set for in Pennsylvania v. Nelson, 350 U.S. 497, 76 S.Ct. 477, 100 L.Ed. 640 (1956), the court held that the taxes did not conflict with federal regulation of tribal timber, that the federal interest was not so dominant as to preclude assessment of the challenged state taxes, and that the federal regulatory scheme did not \"occupy the field.\"  The court also concluded that the state taxes would not unlawfully infringe on tribal self-government.  The Arizona Supreme Court declined to review the decision of the Court of Appeals.  We granted certiorari.  444 U.S. 823, 100 S.Ct. 43, 62 L.Ed.2d 30 (1980).\n\nII\n\n8\nAlthough \"[g]eneralizations on this subject have become  . . .  treacherous,\" Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U.S. 145, 148, 93 S.Ct. 1267, 1270, 36 L.Ed.2d 114 (1973), our decisions establish several basic principles with respect to the boundaries between state regulatory authority and tribal self-government. Long ago the Court departed from Mr. Chief Justice Marshall's view that \"the laws of [a State] can have no force\" within reservation boundaries, Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 561, 8 L.Ed. 483 (1832).9  See Moe v. Salish & Kootenai Tribes, 425 U.S. 463, 481-483, 96 S.Ct. 1634, 1645-1646, 48 L.Ed.2d 96 (1976);  New York ex rel. Ray v. Martin, 326 U.S. 496, 66 S.Ct. 307, 90 L.Ed. 261 (1946);  Utah & Northern R. Co. v. Fisher, 116 U.S. 28, 6 S.Ct. 246, 29 L.Ed. 542 (1885).  At the same time we have recognized that the Indian tribes retain \"attributes of sovereignty over both their members and their territory.\"   United States v. Mazurie, 419 U.S. 544, 557, 95 S.Ct. 710, 717, 42 L.Ed.2d 706 (1975).  See also United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313, 323, 98 S.Ct. 1079, 1086, 55 L.Ed.2d 303 (1978);  Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 55-56, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 1675-1676, 56 L.Ed.2d 106 (1978).  As a result, there is no rigid rule by which to resolve the question whether a particular state law may be applied to an Indian reservation or to tribal members.  The status of the tribes has been described as \" 'an anomalous one and of complex character,' \" for despite their partial assimilation into American culture, the tribes have retained \" 'a semi-independent position  . . .  not as States, not as nations, not as possessed of the full attributes of sovereignty, but as a separate people, with the power of regulating their internal and social relations, and thus far not brought under the laws of the Union or of the State within whose limits they resided.' \" McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n, 411 U.S. 164, 173, 93 S.Ct. 1257, 1263, 36 L.Ed.2d 129 (1973), quoting United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375, 381-382, 6 S.Ct. 1109, 1112-1113, 30 L.Ed. 228 (1886).\n\n\n9\nCongress has broad power to regulate tribal affairs under the Indian Commerce Clause, Art. 1, \u00a7 8, cl. 3.  See United States v. Wheeler, supra, at 322-323, 98 S.Ct., at 1085-1086.  This congressional authority and the \"semi-independent position\" of Indian tribes have given rise to two independent but related barriers to the assertion of state regulatory authority over tribal reservations and members.  First, the exercise of such authority may be pre-empted by federal law.  See, e. g., Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 380 U.S. 685, 85 S.Ct. 1242, 14 L.Ed.2d 165 (1965);  McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n, supra.  Second, it may unlawfully infringe \"on the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.\"  Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217, 220, 79 S.Ct. 269, 271, 3 L.Ed.2d 251 (1959).  See also Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation, 439 U.S. 463, 502, 99 S.Ct. 740, 762, 58 L.Ed.2d 740 (1979); Fisher v. District Court, 424 U.S. 382, 96 S.Ct. 943, 47 L.Ed.2d 106 (1976) (per curiam );  Kennerly v. District Court of Montana, 400 U.S. 423, 91 S.Ct. 480, 27 L.Ed.2d 507 (1971).  The two barriers are independent because either, standing alone, can be a sufficient basis for holding state law inapplicable to activity undertaken on the reservation or by tribal members.  They are related, however, in two important ways.  The right of tribal self-government is ultimately dependent on and subject to the broad power of Congress.  Even so, traditional notions of Indian self-government are so deeply engrained in our jurisprudence that they have provided an important \"backdrop,\" McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n, supra, at 172, 93 S.Ct., at 1262, against which vague or ambiguous federal enactments must always be measured.\n\n\n10\nThe unique historical origins of tribal sovereignty make it generally unhelpful to apply to federal enactments regulating Indian tribes those standards of pre-emption that have emerged in other areas of the law.  Tribal reservations are not States, and the differences in the form and nature of their sovereignty make it treacherous to import to one notions of pre-emption that are properly applied to the other.  The tradition of Indian sovereignty over the reservation and tribal members must inform the determination whether the exercise of state authority has been pre-empted by operation of federal law.  Moe v. Salish & Kootenai Tribes, supra, at 475, 96 S.Ct., at 1642.  As we have repeatedly recognized, this tradition is reflected and encouraged in a number of congressional enactments demonstrating a firm federal policy of promoting tribal self-sufficiency and economic development.10 Ambiguities in federal law have been construed generously in order to comport with these traditional notions of sovereignty and with the federal policy of encouraging tribal independence.  See McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n, supra, at 174-175, and n. 13, 93 S.Ct. 1263-1264, and n. 13.  We have thus rejected the proposition that in order to find a particular state law to have been preempted by operation of federal law, an express congressional statement to that effect is required.11 Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, supra. At the same time any applicable regulatory interest of the State must be given weight, McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n, supra, at 171, 93 S.Ct., at 1261, and \"automatic exemptions 'as a matter of constitutional law' \" are unusual.   Moe v. Salish & Kootenai Tribes, 425 U.S., at 481, n. 17, 96 S.Ct., at 1645, n. 17.\n\n\n11\nWhen on-reservation conduct involving only Indians is at issue, state law is generally inapplicable, for the State's regulatory interest is likely to be minimal and the federal interest in encouraging tribal self-government is at its strongest.  See Moe v. Salish & Kootenai Tribes, supra, at 480-481, 96 S.Ct., at 1644-1645;  McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n.  More difficult questions arise where, as here, a State asserts authority over the conduct of non-Indians engaging in activity on the reservation.  In such cases we have examined the language of the relevant federal treaties and statutes in terms of both the broad policies that underlie them and the notions of sovereignty that have developed from historical traditions of tribal independence. This inquiry is not dependent on mechanical or absolute conceptions of state or tribal sovereignty, but has called for a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state, federal, and tribal interests at stake, an inquiry designed to determine whether, in the specific context, the exercise of state authority would violate federal law.  Compare Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, supra, and Williams v. Lee, supra, with Moe v. Salish & Kootenai Tribes, supra, and Thomas v. Gay, 169 U.S. 264 (1898).  Cf. McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n, 411 U.S., at 171, 93 S.Ct., at 1261;  Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U.S., at 148, 93 S.Ct., at 1270.\n\nIII\n\n12\nWith these principles in mind, we turn to the respondents' claim that they may, consistent with federal law, impose the contested motor vehicle license and use fuel taxes on the logging and hauling operations of petitioner Pinetop.  At the outset we observe that the Federal Government's regulation of the harvesting of Indian timber is comprehensive.  That regulation takes the form of Acts of Congress, detailed regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior, and day-to-day supervision by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  Under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405-407, the Secretary of the Interior is granted broad authority over the sale of timber on the reservation.12 Timber on Indian land may be sold only with the consent of the Secretary, and the proceeds from any such sales, less administrative expenses incurred by the Federal Government, are to be used for the benefit of the Indians or transferred to the Indian owner.  Sales of timber must \"be based upon a consideration of the needs and best interests of the Indian owner and his heirs.\"  25 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(a).  The statute specifies the factors which the Secretary must consider in making that determination.13 In order to assure the continued productivity of timber-producing land on tribal reservations, timber on unallotted lands \"may be sold in accordance with the principles of sustained yield.\"  25 U.S.C. \u00a7 407.  The Secretary is granted power to determine the disposition of the proceeds from timber sales.  He is authorized to promulgate regulations for the operation and management of Indian forestry units.  25 U.S.C. \u00a7 466.\n\n\n13\nActing pursuant to this authority, the Secretary has promulgated a detailed set of regulations to govern the harvesting and sale of tribal timber.  Among the stated objectives of the regulations is the \"development of Indian forests by the Indian people for the purpose of promoting self-sustaining communities, to the end that the Indians may receive from their own property not only the stumpage value, but also the benefit of whatever profit it is capable of yielding and whatever labor the Indians are qualified to perform.\"  25 CFR \u00a7 141.3(a)(3) (1979).  The regulations cover a wide variety of matters:  for example, they restrict clear-cutting, \u00a7 141.5;  establish comprehensive guidelines for the sale of timber, \u00a7 141.7;  regulate the advertising of timber sales, \u00a7\u00a7 141.8, 141.9;  specify the manner in which bids may be accepted and rejected, \u00a7 141.11;  describe the circumstances in which contracts may be entered into, \u00a7\u00a7 141.12, 141.13;  require the approval of all contracts by the Secretary, \u00a7 141.13;  call for timber-cutting permits to be approved by the Secretary, \u00a7 141.19;  specify fire protective measures, \u00a7 141.21;  and provide a board of administrative appeals, \u00a7 141.23.  Tribes are expressly authorized to establish commercial enterprises for the harvesting and logging of tribal timber.  \u00a7 141.6.\n\n\n14\nUnder these regulations, the Bureau of Indian Affairs exercises literally daily supervision over the harvesting and management of tribal timber.  In the present case, contracts between FATCO and Pinetop must be approved by the Bureau;  indeed, the record shows that some of those contracts were drafted by employees of the Federal Government.  Bureau employees regulate the cutting, hauling, and marking of timber by FATCO and Pinetop. The Bureau decides such matters as how much timber will be cut, which trees will be felled, which roads are to be used, which hauling equipment Pinetop should employ, the speeds at which logging equipment may travel, and the width, length, height, and weight of loads.\n\n\n15\nThe Secretary has also promulgated detailed regulations governing the roads developed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 25 CFR Part 162 (1979).  Bureau roads are open to \"[f]ree public use.\"  \u00a7 162.8.  Their administration and maintenance are funded by the Federal Government, with contributions from the Indian tribes.  \u00a7\u00a7 162.6-162.6a.  On the Fort Apache Reservation the Forestry Department of the Bureau has required FATCO and its contractors, including Pinetop, to repair and maintain existing Bureau and tribal roads and in some cases to construct new logging roads.  Substantial sums have been spent for these purposes.  In its federally approved contract with FATCO, Pinetop has agreed to construct new roads and to repair existing ones.  A high percentage of Pinetop's receipts are expended for those purposes, and it has maintained separate personnel and equipment to carry out a variety of tasks relating to road maintenance.\n\n\n16\nIn these circumstances we agree with petitioners that the federal regulatory scheme is so pervasive as to preclude the additional burdens sought to be imposed in this case.  Respondents seek to apply their motor vehicle license and use fuel taxes on Pinetop for operations that are conducted solely on Bureau and tribal roads within the reservation.14  There is no room for these taxes in the comprehensive federal regulatory scheme.  In a variety of ways, the assessment of state taxes would obstruct federal policies.  And equally important, respondents have been unable to identify any regulatory function or service performed by the State that would justify the assessment of taxes for activities on Bureau and tribal roads within the reservation.\n\n\n17\nAt the most general level, the taxes would threaten the overriding federal objective of guaranteeing Indians that they will \"receive  . . .  the benefit of whatever profit [the forest] is capable of yielding.  . . . \"  25 CFR \u00a7 141.3(a)(3) (1979). Underlying the federal regulatory program rests a policy of assuring that the profits derived from timber sales will inure to the benefit of the Tribe, subject only to administrative expenses incurred by the Federal Government.  That objective is part of the general federal policy of encouraging tribes \"to revitalize their self-government\" and to assume control over their \"business and economic affairs.\"  Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U.S., at 151, 93 S.Ct., at 1272.  The imposition of the taxes at issue would undermine that policy in a context in which the Federal Government has undertaken to regulate the most minute details of timber production and expressed a firm desire that the Tribe should retain the benefits derived from the harvesting and sale of reservation timber.\n\n\n18\nIn addition, the taxes would undermine the Secretary's ability to make the wide range of determinations committed to his authority concerning the setting of fees and rates with respect to the harvesting and sale of tribal timber.  The Secretary reviews and approves the terms of the Tribe's agreements with its contractors, sets fees for services rendered to the Tribe by the Federal Government, and determines stumpage rates for timber to be paid to the Tribe.  Most notably in reviewing or writing the terms of the contracts between FATCO and its contractors, federal agents must predict the amount and determine the proper allocation of all business expenses, including fuel costs.  The assessment of state taxes would throw additional factors into the federal calculus, reducing tribal revenues and diminishing the profitability of the enterprise for potential contractors.\n\n\n19\nFinally, the imposition of state taxes would adversely affect the Tribe's ability to comply with the sustainedyield management policies imposed by federal law.  Substantial expenditures are paid out by the Federal Government, the Tribe, and its contractors in order to undertake a wide variety of measures to ensure the continued productivity of the forest. These measures include reforestation, fire control, wildlife promotion, road improvement, safety inspections, and general policing of the forest.  The expenditures are largely paid for out of tribal revenues, which are in turn derived almost exclusively from the sale of timber.  The imposition of state taxes on FATCO's contractors would effectively diminish the amount of those revenues and thus leave the Tribe and its contractors with reduced sums with which to pay out federally required expenses.\n\n\n20\nAs noted above, this is not a case in which the State seeks to assess taxes in return for governmental functions it performs for those on whom the taxes fall.  Nor have respondents been able to identify a legitimate regulatory interest served by the taxes they seek to impose.  They refer to a general desire to raise revenue, but we are unable to discern a responsibility or service that justifies the assertion of taxes imposed for on-reservation operations conducted solely on tribal and Bureau of Indian Affairs roads.  Pinetop's business in Arizona is conducted solely on the Fort Apache Reservation.  Though at least the use fuel tax purports to \"compensat[e] the state for the use of its highways,\" Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 28-1552 (Supp.1979), no such compensatory purpose is present here.  The roads at issue have been built, maintained, and policed exclusively by the Federal Government, the Tribe, and its contractors.  We do not believe that respondents' generalized interest in raising revenue is in this context sufficient to permit its proposed intrusion into the federal regulatory scheme with respect to the harvesting and sale of tribal timber.\n\n\n21\nRespondents' argument is reduced to a claim that they may assess taxes on non-Indians engaged in commerce on the reservation whenever there is no express congressional statement to the contrary.  That is simply not the law.  In a number of cases we have held that state authority over non-Indians acting on tribal reservations is pre-empted even though Congress has offered no explicit statement on the subject.  See Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 380 U.S. 685, 85 S.Ct. 1242, 14 L.Ed.2d 165 (1965);  Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217, 79 S.Ct. 269, 3 L.Ed.2d 251 (1959);  Kennerly v. District Court of Montana, 400 U.S. 423, 91 S.Ct. 480, 27 L.Ed.2d 507 (1971).  The Court has repeatedly emphasized that there is a significant geographical component to tribal sovereignty, a component which remains highly relevant to the pre-emption inquiry;  though the reservation boundary is not absolute, it remains an important factor to weigh in determining whether state authority has exceeded the permissible limits.  \" 'The cases in this Court have consistently guarded the authority of Indian governments over their reservations.' \"  United States v. Mazurie, supra, 419 U.S., at 558, 95 S.Ct., at 718, quoting Williams v. Lee, supra, at 223, 79 S.Ct., at 272.  Moreover, it is undisputed that the economic burden of the asserted taxes will ultimately fall on the Tribe.15  Where, as here, the Federal Government has undertaken comprehensive regulation of the harvesting and sale of tribal timber, where a number of the policies underlying the federal regulatory scheme are threatened by the taxes respondents seek to impose, and where respondents are unable to justify the taxes except in terms of a generalized interest in raising revenue, we believe that the proposed exercise of state authority is impermissible.16\n\n\n22\nBoth the reasoning and result in this case follow naturally from our unanimous decision in Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, supra.  There the State of Arizona sought to impose a \"gross proceeds\" tax on a non-Indian company which conducted a retail trading business on the Navajo Indian Reservation. Referring to the tradition of sovereign power over the reservation, the Court held that the \"comprehensive federal regulation of Indian traders\" prohibited the assessment of the attempted taxes.  Id., 380 U.S., at 688, 85 S.Ct., at 1244.  No federal statute by its terms precluded the assessment of state tax.  Nonetheless, the \"detailed regulations,\" specifying \"in the most minute fashion,\" id., at 689, 85 S.Ct., at 1244, the licensing and regulation of Indian traders, were held \"to show that Congress has taken the business of Indian trading on reservations so fully in hand that no room remains for state laws imposing additional burdens upon traders.\"  Id., at 690, 85 S.Ct., at 1245.  The imposition of those burdens, we held, \"could . . . disturb and disarrange the statutory plan\" because the economic burden of the state taxes would eventually be passed on to the Indians themselves.  Id., at 691, 85 S.Ct., at 1246.  We referred to the fact that the Tribe had been \"largely free to run the reservation and its affairs without state control, a policy which has automatically relieved Arizona of all burdens for carrying on those same responsibilities.\"  Id., at 690, 85 S.Ct., at 1245. And we emphasized that \"since federal legislation has left the State with no duties or responsibilities respecting the reservation Indians, we cannot believe that Congress intended to leave to the State the privilege of levying this tax.\"  Id., at 691, 85 S.Ct., at 1246.  The present case, we conclude, is in all relevant respects indistinguishable from Warren Trading Post.\n\n\n23\nThe decision of the Arizona Court of Appeals is\n\n\n24\nReversed.\n\n\n25\nMr. Justice STEVENS, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting.\n\n\n26\nThe State of Arizona imposes use fuel and motor carrier license taxes on certain businesses in order to compensate it for their greater than normal use of public roads.  See 448 U.S. 160, 170, n. 3, 100 S.Ct. 2599, at 2601, n. 3, 65 L.Ed.2d 684 (POWELL, J., concurring).  The issue originally presented to this Court was whether the State was prohibited from imposing such taxes on a non-Indian joint venture (Pinetop Logging Co.) hired by the petitioner Tribe to perform logging operations on the Fort Apache Reservation, when the taxes were based on Pinetop's use of roads located solely within the reservation.  In light of the concessions made by both sides at various stages of the litigation, however, I doubt that we should reach that issue in this case.  Moreover, even if the merits were properly before us, I could not agree with the Court's determination that the state taxes are pre-empted by federal law.\n\n\n27\nBetween November 1971 and May 1976, Pinetop paid under protest use fuel taxes of $19,114.59 and motor carrier license taxes of $14,701.42.  The Arizona Court of Appeals determined that the latter assessment improperly denied Pinetop a 60% credit to which it was entitled under state law.1  After allowance for that credit, the total amount of the disputed taxes for the 41\/2-year period is reduced to about $25,000 or $5,000-$6,000 per year.\n\n\n28\nThe taxes actually in dispute, however, are considerably less.  Pinetop concedes that some of its operations are subject to tax and the State concedes that Pinetop is entitled to additional credits.  To understand these concessions it is necessary to note that Pinetop's vehicles operate on four different kinds of roads within the Fort Apache Reservation:  (1) state highways;  (2) federally funded (Bureau of Indian Affairs) roads serving recreational public needs;  (3) tribal roads exclusively financed and maintained by the Indians;  and (4) private logging roads built and maintained by loggers such as Pinetop.2\n\n\n29\nAlthough Pinetop represents that its use of the Arizona state highways within the reservation is extremely limited, it does not dispute its tax liability for such use.  On the other hand, in this Court the State expressly conceded that its assessments were improper under state law to the extent that they applied to operations on either private logging roads3 or tribal roads.4  If it is conceded that the State may tax Pinetop's use of public roads maintained by the State and may not tax the use of tribal or private roads, the question that arises is whether the public roads maintained by the Bureau of Indian Affairs are more akin to the former or to the latter.  It appears that the BIA roads are like the state highways insofar as they are open to use by the general public.5  On the other hand, it also appears that they were constructed and maintained by the Federal Government and are policed by federal and tribal officers.6\n\n\n30\nUnder these circumstances I think the most appropriate disposition would be to vacate the judgment of the Arizona Court of Appeals and remand for further consideration in light of the concessions made on behalf of the State in this Court.  As the Court and Mr. Justice POWELL point out, it is difficult to see why those concessions are not an acknowledgement that the State has no authority to tax the use of roads in which it has no interest. See ante, at 148, n. 14 (opinion of the Court);  448 U.S., at 174, 100 S.Ct., at 2601 (POWELL, J., concurring).  If the state court were given an opportunity to focus on this point, we might well find that there is no remaining federal issue to be decided.\n\n\n31\nEven assuming, however, that the state courts would uphold the imposition of taxes based on the use of BIA roads, despite their similarities to private and tribal roads, I would not find those taxes to be pre-empted by federal law.  InWarren Trading Post v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 380 U.S. 685, 85 S.Ct. 1242, 14 L.Ed.2d 165, the Court held that state taxation of a non-Indian doing business with a tribe on the reservation was pre-empted because the taxes threatened to \"disturb and disarrange\" a pervasive scheme of federal regulation and because there was no governmental interest on the State's part in imposing such a burden.  See Central Machinery Co. v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n, 448 U.S. 160, 168, 100 S.Ct. 2592, 2596, 65 L.Ed.2d 684 (STEWART, J., dissenting).  In this case we may assume, arguendo, that the second factor relied upon inWarren Trading Post is present.  As a result, Pinetop may well have a right to be free from taxation as a matter of due process or equal protection.7  But I cannot agree that it has a right to be free from taxation because of its business relationship with the petitioner Tribe.\n\n\n32\nAs the Court points out, the Federal Government has imposed a detailed scheme of regulation on the tribal logging business. Thus, among other things, the BIA approves and sometimes drafts contracts between the Tribe and non-Indian logging companies such as Pinetop and requires the Tribe and its contractors to follow BIA's dictates as to where to cut, haul and mark timber, and as to which roads to construct and repair.  Ante, at 148, n. 14.  The Court reasons that, because the imposition of state taxes on non-Indian contractors is likely to increase the price of their services to the tribe and thus decrease the profitability of the tribal enterprise, the taxes would substantially interfere with this scheme.  Thus, the Court states that the taxes threaten the \"overriding federal objective\" of guaranteeing Indians all the profits the forest is capable of yielding, \"undermine\" the Federal Government's ability to set fees and rates with respect to non-Indian contractors, and \"adversely affect the Tribe's ability to comply with the sustained-yield management policies imposed by federal law.\"  Ante, at 149-150.\n\n\n33\nFrom a practical standpoint, the Court's prediction of massive interference with federal forest-management programs seems overdrawn, to say the least.  The logging operations involved in this case produced a profit of $1,508,713 for the Indian tribal enterprise in 1973.  As noted above, the maximum annual taxes Pinetop would be required to pay would be $5,000-$6,000 or less than 1% of the total annual profits. Given the State's concession in this Court that the use of certain roads should not have been taxed as a matter of state law, the actual taxes Pinetop would be required to pay would probably be considerably less.8  It is difficult to believe that these relatively trivial taxes could impose an economic burden that would threaten to \"obstruct federal policies.\"\n\n\n34\nUnder these circumstances I find the Court's reliance on the indirect financial burden imposed on the Indian Tribe by state taxation of its contractors disturbing.  As a general rule, a tax is not invalid simply because a nonexempt taxpayer may be expected to pass all or part of the cost of the tax through to a person who is exempt from tax.  See United States v. Detroit, 355 U.S. 466, 469, 78 S.Ct. 474, 476, 2 L.Ed.2d 424, cf. Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation, 447 U.S. 134, 100 S.Ct. 2069, 65 L.Ed.2d 10.  In Warren Trading Post the Court found an exception to this rule where Congress had chosen to regulate the relationship between an Indian tribe and a non-Indian trader to such an extent that there was no room for the additional burden of state taxation.  In this case, since the state tax is unlikely to have a serious adverse impact on the tribal business, I would not infer the same congressional intent to confer a tax immunity.  Although this may be an appropriate way in which to subsidize Indian industry and encourage Indian self-government, I would require more explicit evidence of congressional intent than that relied on by the Court today.\n\n\n35\nI respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n The Fort Apache Reservation was originally established as the White Mountain Reservation by an Executive Order signed by President Grant on November 9, 1871.  By the Act of Congress of June 7, 1897, 30 Stat. 64, the White Mountain Reservation was divided into the Fort Apache and San Carlos Reservations.\n\n\n2\n In 1973, for example, tribal enterprises showed a net profit of $1,667,091, $1,508,713 of which was attributable to timber operations.\n\n\n3\n FATCO initially attempted to perform some of its own logging and hauling operations but found itself unable to do these tasks economically.\n\n\n4\n Respondents are the Arizona Highway Department, the Arizona Highway Commission, and individual members of each entity.\n\n\n5\n Between November 1971 and May 1976 Pinetop paid under protest $19,114.59 in use fuel taxes and $14,701.42 in motor carrier license taxes.  Since that time it has continued to pay taxes pending the outcome of this case.  Refund litigation is pending in state court with respect to the five other non-Indian contractors employed by the Tribe, and that litigation has been stayed pending the outcome of this suit.\n\n\n6\n For purposes of this action petitioners have conceded Pinetop's liability for both motor carrier license and use fuel taxes attributable to travel on state highways within the reservation.  Pinetop has maintained records of fuel attributable to travel on those highways, and computations would evidently be made in order to allocate a portion of the gross receipts taxable under the motor carrier license tax to state highways.\n\n\n7\n When Pinetop contracted to undertake timber operations for FATCO in 1969, both Pinetop and FATCO believed that it would not be required to pay state taxes.  After respondents assessed the taxes at issue, FATCO agreed to pay them to avoid the loss of Pinetop's services.\n\n\n8\n After the trial court entered summary judgment on the issue of the applicability of the state taxes, the case proceeded to trial on the state-law issue of the manner of calculating the motor vehicle license tax.  Final judgment was entered for respondents on all issues after trial.  The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the Superior Court on the calculation of the motor vehicle license tax.  120 Ariz. 282, 291, 585 P.2d 819, 900 (1978).\n\n\n9\n The shift in approach is discussed in Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217, 219, 79 S.Ct. 269, 270, 3 L.Ed.2d 251 (1959);  Organized Village of Kake v. Egan, 369 U.S. 60, 71-75, 82 S.Ct. 562, 568-570, 7 L.Ed.2d 573 (1962);  and McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n, 411 U.S. 164, 172, 93 S.Ct. 1257, 1262, 36 L.Ed.2d 129 (1973).\n\n\n10\n For example, the Indian Financing Act of 1974, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1451 et seq., states:  \"It is hereby declared to be the policy of Congress  . . .  to help develop and utilize Indian resources, both physical and human, to a point where the Indians will fully exercise responsibility for the utilization and management of their own resources and where they will enjoy a standard of living from their own productive efforts comparable to that enjoyed by non-Indians in neighboring communities.\"  Similar policies underlie the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 450 et seq., as well as the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 461 et seq., whose \"intent and purpose  . . .  was 'to rehabilitate the Indian's economic life and to give him a chance to develop the initiative destroyed by a century of oppression and paternalism.' \"  Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U.S. 145, 152, 93 S.Ct. 1267, 1272, 36 L.Ed.2d 114 (1973), quoting H.R.Rep. No. 1804, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 6 (1934).  See also Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 56 L.Ed.2d 106 (1978).  Cf. Gross, Indian Self-Determination and Tribal Sovereignty:  An Analysis of Recent Federal Policy, 56 Texas L.Rev. 1195 (1978).\n\n\n11\n In the case of \"Indians going beyond reservation boundaries,\" however, \"a nondiscriminatory state law\" is generally applicable in the absence of \"express federal law to the contrary.\"  Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, supra, at 148-149, 93 S.Ct., at 1270.\n\n\n12\n Federal policies with respect to tribal timber have a long history.  In United States v. Cook, 19 Wall. 591, 22 L.Ed. 210 (1874), and Pine River Logging Co. v. United States, 186 U.S. 279, 22 S.Ct. 920, 46 L.Ed. 1164 (1902), the Court held that tribal members had no right to sell timber on reservation land unless the sale was related to the improvement of the land.  At the same time the Court interpreted the governing statute as designed \"to permit deserving Indians, who had no other sufficient means of support, to cut  . . .  a limited quantity of  . . . timber  . . .  and to use the proceeds for their support  . . . , provided that 10 percent of the gross proceeds should go to the stumpage or poor fund of the tribe, from which the old, sick and otherwise helpless might be supported.\"  Id., at 285-286, 22 S.Ct., at 922.\nThe Attorney General interpreted the holding in Cook to mean that Indians had no right to reservation timber.  See 19 Op.Atty.Gen. 194 (1888).  This interpretation was overturned by Congress by Act of June 25, 1910, ch. 431, 36 Stat. 855, as amended, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 407, and also repudiated in United States v. Shoshone Tribe, 304 U.S. 111, 58 S.Ct. 794, 82 L.Ed. 1213 (1938). Thus, as the Court summarized in United States v. Algoma Lumber Co., 305 U.S. 415, 420, 59 S.Ct. 267, 270, 83 L.Ed. 260 (1939), \"[u]nder  . . .  established principles applicable to land reservations created for the benefit of the Indian tribes, the Indians are beneficial owners of the land and the timber standing upon it and of the proceeds of their sale, subject to the plenary power of control by the United States, to be exercised for the benefit and protection of the Indians.\"  See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 196; United States v. Mitchell, 445 U.S. 535, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980).\n\n\n13\n Those factors include \"(1) the state of growth of the timber and the need for maintaining the productive capacity of the land for the benefit of the owner and his heirs, (2) the highest and the best use of the land, including the advisability and practicality of devoting it to other uses for the benefit of the owner and his heirs, and (3) the present and future financial needs of the owner and his heirs.\"  25 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(a).\n\n\n14\n In oral argument counsel for respondents appeared to concede that the asserted state taxes could not lawfully be applied to tribal roads and was unwilling to defend the contrary conclusion of the court below, which made no distinction between Bureau and tribal roads under state and federal law.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 34-37.  Contrary to respondents' position throughout the litigation and in their brief in this Court, counsel limited his argument to a contention that the taxes could be asserted on the roads of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  Ibid.  For purposes of federal pre-emption, however, we see no basis, and respondents point to none, for distinguishing between roads maintained by the Tribe and roads maintained by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\n\n15\n Of course, the fact that the economic burden of the tax falls on the Tribe does not by itself mean that the tax is pre-empted, as Moe v. Salish & Kootenai Tribes, 425 U.S. 463, 96 S.Ct. 1634, 48 L.Ed.2d 96 (1976), makes clear.  Our decision today is based on the pre-emptive effect of the comprehensive federal regulatory scheme, which, like that in Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 380 U.S. 685, 85 S.Ct. 1242, 14 L.Ed.2d 165 (1965), leaves no room for the additional burdens sought to be imposed by state law.\n\n\n16\n Respondents also contend that the taxes are authorized by the Buck Act, 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 105 et seq., and the Hayden-Cartwright Act, 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 104.  In Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, supra, 380 U.S., at 691, n. 18, 85 S.Ct., at 1246, n. 18, we squarely held that the Buck Act did not apply to Indian reservations, and respondents present no sufficient reason for us to depart from that holding.  We agree with petitioners that the Hayden-Cartwright Act, which authorizes state taxes \"on United States military or other reservations,\" was not designed to overcome the otherwise pre-emptive effect of federal regulation of tribal timber.  We need not reach the more general question whether the Hayden-Cartwright Act applies to Indian reservations at all.\n\n\n1\n Under Arizona law, logging operations are exempt from the motor carrier license tax if the wood they haul is used for pulpwood.  In this case 60% of the logs hauled by Pinetop were to be used for pulpwood.\n\n\n2\n In paragraph XIII of their complaint, petitioners alleged:\n\"There are four categories of roads in the Ft. Apache Indian Reservation which are used by the Plaintiffs in their logging operations:  (1) tribal roads financed and maintained by the Indians exclusively;  (2) federally funded (Bureau of Indian Affairs) roads serving recreational public needs;  (3) state highways;  and (4) logging roads built and maintained by loggers. In transporting timber from the woods to the sawmill, plaintiffs' vehicles travel substantially over tribal and BIA roads, although short portions of many of the trips are on state highways.\n\"The only category of roads on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation which are built or maintained by the State of Arizona, is category (3), state highways.  Categories (1), (2), and (4) are financed and maintained by sources other than monies from the State of Arizona.  Tribal, BIA and logging roads are not public highways within the meaning of Arizona Revised Statutes Sec. 40-601.9, and thus any use fuel and license motor carrier taxes on these roads are inappropriate.\"\n\n\n3\n At oral argument, the Assistant Attorney General of the State of Arizona stated:\n\"But so long as the road remained a private thoroughfare they would not be so traveled and use of those road [sic ] would not be subject to the State tax.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 32.\nLater in the argument he was asked the following question and gave the following answer:\n\"Mr. Macpherson, quite apart from the question in this case which involves Indian tribes, what about a private owner of land whether it is the Weyerhauseur Company or a rancher who owns many square miles of ranch land, does Arizona impose a tax upon his fuel if the vehicle that he owns is used exclusively on his own private property 365 days a year, or this year 366, and never on the public roads of Arizona?\n\"MR. MACPHERSON:  It does not, Your Honor.\"  Id., at 39.\n\n\n4\n With respect to tribal roads, the Assistant Attorney General advised the Court at oral argument:\n\"However, the fact of the matter is that under current State law, under the legislative scheme that exists in Arizona right now, Arizona has no intention of going forward on some purported theory that because the Court of Appeals decision says we can, that we can go ahead and tax use on these tribal roads.  I have been assured of that by my client by telephone last night.  And other than that we would put that before the Court to apprise the court of what the true facts are.\"  Id., at 35. In rebuttal, counsel for petitioners expressed surprise at, but nevertheless accepted, the concession made by the State.  Counsel stated:\n\"My good friend, Mr. Macpherson, has just said some remarkable things.\n\"I think I hear him saying that the State is no longer interested in collecting taxes from tribal roads on the reservation which are not Bureau of Indian Affairs roads.  If that is what he said, then I am delighted to accept him accept his concession.  But I must also correct some of the suggestions he has made.\n\"His predecessor, the Attorney for the State of Arizona, argued in the State appellate courts that the State was claiming the right to tax tribal roads.  The judgment of the lower court gives the State the right to tax tribal roads.  And that is the judgment we are burdened with and that is the judgment which we bring to this Court.\n\"Our opening briefs state that is the issue.  Their briefs acknowledge that is the issue . . . and that was the issue before the Court.\n*          *          *          *          *\n\"Trial counsel, Mr. Beus who is here, informs me over the lunch period that his understanding was that administrative agreement included the payment of certain taxes allocable to tribal roads.\n\"QUESTION:  Well, as I say, that is of some importance, at least to me, whether there is an issue to taxes, either fuel or gross receipts taxes imposed on vehicles insofar as their use was confined to tribal roads.\n\"Is there, or is there not a dispute?\n\"MR. WAKE:  I submit there was until Mr. Macpherson spoke.\n\"QUESTION:  Well, now you submit there isn't.  And I\u2014\n\"MR. WAKE:  I submit there isn't because [counsel] has conceded the issue or [is] withdrawing the issue.  And perhaps he can clarify his remarks.\n\"QUESTION:  You say you accept it gladly.\n\"MR. WAKE:  I accept it gladly but\u2014\n\"QUESTION:  You have won your case on the\u2014\n\"MR. WAKE:  Your Honor, I would point out that that being the concession as I understand it, it would be appropriate in any event the judgment of the lower court to be correct in that regard since\u2014\"  Id., at 54-56.\n\n\n5\n The following colloquy occurred at oral argument:\n\"QUESTION:  What I meant to say is your real fight is over the right to tax on BIA roads.\n\"Does the record tell us much about those roads, for example does it tell us whether the State police are on those roads or whether they have speed limits or things like that?\n\"MR. MACPHERSON:  Your Honor, the record does not specifically go into that much detail.\n\"QUESTION:  However, it presents us with a hypothetical case quite different from the one you asked us to decide.\n\"MR. MACPHERSON:  Well, Mr. Justice Stevens, the case is\u2014we felt it necessary as an ethical consideration to apprise the Court of what the actual situation is.\n\"But, having said that, the issue, the legal issue, if it please the Court, may still be decided with respect to the BIA road use.  The fact of the matter is that BIA roads pursuant to Federal\u2014the Code of Federal Regulations are required to be open to free public use, as a matter of Federal law.\"  Id., at 36-37.\n\n\n6\n \"QUESTION:  Did I understand you to say that Arizona has no responsibility for maintaining the BIA roads?\n\"MR. MACPHERSON:  This is correct, Your Honor.\n\"QUESTION:  And did it contribute to the construction of those roads?\n\"MR. MACPHERSON:  So far as the record shows, it did not, Your Honor.\n\"QUESTION:  And no police responsibility, either?\n\"MR. MACPHERSON:  That is correct, Your Honor.  . . . \"  Id., at 41-42.\n\n\n7\n The Due Process Clause may prohibit a State from imposing a tax on the use of completely private roads if the tax is designed to reimburse it for use of state-owned roads.  Or it may be that once the State has decided to exempt private roads from its taxing system, it is also required, as a matter of equal protection, to exempt other types of roads that are identical to private roads in all relevant respects.\n\n\n8\n The parties have not told us what portion of the taxes is attributable to the use of each of the various types of roads. Thus, we cannot determine how much tax Pinetop would be required to pay for its use of BIA roads.\n\n\n","label":1}

CUNNINGHAM, Jr., Superintendent of Virginia  State Penitentiary.\nNo. 77.\nArgued Dec. 3, 1962.\nDecided Jan. 14, 1963.\n\nDaniel J. Meador, Charlottesville, Va., for petitioner.\nReno S. Harp, III, Richmond, Va., for respondent.\nMr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nA United States District Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241 to grant a writ of habeas corpus 'to a prisoner * * * in custody in violation of the Constitution * * * of the United States.' The question in this case is whether a state prisoner who has been placed on parole is 'in custody' within the meaning of this section so that a Federal District Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine his charge that his state sentence was imposed in violation of the United States Constitution.1\n\n\n2\nIn 1953 petitioner was convicted in a Virginia state court of an offense requiring confinement in the state penitentiary, and as this was his third such offense he was sentenced to serve 10 years in the state penitentiary. In 1961 he filed this petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging that his third-offender sentence was based in part upon a 1946 larceny conviction which was invalid because his federal constitutional right to counsel had been denied at the 1946 trial. The District Court dismissed the petition but the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted a certificate of probable cause and leave to appeal in forma pauperis. Shortly before the case came on for oral argument before the Court of Appeals petitioner was paroled by the Virginia Parole Board. The parole order placed petitioner in the 'custody and control' of the Parole Board and directed him to live with his aunt and uncle in LaFayette, Georgia. It provided that his parole was subject to revocation or modification at any time by the Parole Board and that petitioner could be arrested and returned to prison for cause. Among other restrictions and conditions, petitioner was required to obtain the permission of his parole officer to leave the community, to change residence, or to own or operate a motor vehicle. He was further required to make monthly reports to his parole officer, to permit the officer to visit his home or place of employment at any time, and to follow the officer's instructions and advice. When petitioner was placed on parole, the Superintendent of the Virginia State Penitentiary, who was the only respondent in the case, asked the Court of Appeals to dismiss the case as moot since petitioner was no longer in his custody. Petitioner opposed the motion to dismiss but, in view of his parole to the custody of the Virginia Parole Board, moved to add its members as respondents. The Court of Appeals dismissed, holding that the case was moot as to the superintendent because he no longer had custody or control over petitioner 'at large on parole.' It refused to permit the petitioner to add the Parole Board members as respondents because they did not have 'physical custody' of the person of petitioner and were therefore not proper parties. 4 Cir., 294 F.2d 608. We granted certiorari to decide whether a parolee is 'in custody' within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241 and is therefore entitled to invoke the habeas corpus jurisdiction of the United States District Court. 369 U.S. 809, 82 S.Ct. 687, 7 L.Ed.2d 611.\n\n\n3\nThe habeas corpus jurisdictional statute implements the constitutional command that the writ of habeas corpus be made available.2 While limiting its availability to those 'in custody,' the statute does not attempt to mark the boundaries of 'custody' nor in any way other than by use of that word attempt to limit the situations in which the writ can be used. To determine whether habeas corpus could be used to test the legality of a given restraint on liberty, this Court has generally looked to common-law usages and the history of habeas corpus both in England and in this country.3\n\n\n4\nIn England, as in the United States, the chief use of habeas corpus has been to seek the release of persons held in actual, physical custody in prison or jail. Yet English courts have long recognized the writ as a proper remedy even though the restraint is something less than close physical confinement. For example, the King's Bench as early as 1722 held that habeas corpus was appropriate to question whether a woman alleged to be the applicant's wife was being constrained by her guardians to stay away from her husband against her will.4 The test used was simply whether she was 'at her liberty to go where she please(d).'5 So also, habeas corpus was used in 1763 to require the production in court of an indentured 18-year-old girl who had been assigned by her master to another man 'for bad purposes.'6 Although the report indicates no restraint on the girl other than the covenants of the indenture, the King's Bench ordered that she 'be discharged from all restraint, and be at liberty to go where she will.'7 And more than a century ago an English court permitted a parent to use habeas corpus to obtain his children from the other parent, even though the children were 'not under imprisonment, restraint, or duress of any kind.'8 These examples show clearly that English courts have not treated the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, 31 Car. II, c. 2\u2014the forerunner of all habeas corpus acts\u2014as permitting relief only to those in jail or like physical confinement.\n\n\n5\nSimilarly, in the United States the use of habeas corpus has not been restricted to situations in which the applicant is in actual, physical custody. This Court itself has repeatedly held that habeas corpus is available to an alien seeking entry into the United States,9 although in those cases each alien was free to go anywhere else in the world. '(H)is movements,' this Court said, 'are restrained by authority of the United States, and he may by habeas corpus test the validity of his exclusion.'10 Habeas corpus has also been consistently regarded by lower federal courts as the appropriate procedural vehicle for questioning the legality of an induction or enlistment into the military service.11 The restraint, of course, is clear in such cases, but it is far indeed from the kind of 'present physical custody' thought by the Court of Appeals to be required. Again, in the state courts, as in England, habeas corpus has been widely used by parents disputing over which is the fit and proper person to have custody of their child,12 one of which we had before us only a few weeks ago.13 History, usage, and precedent can leave no doubt that, besides physical imprisonment, there are other restraints on a man's liberty, restraints not shared by the public generally, which have been thought sufficient in the English-speaking world to support the issuance of habeas corpus.\n\n\n6\nRespondent strongly urges upon us that however numerous the situations in which habeas corpus will lie prior decisions of this Court conclusively determine that the liberty of a person released on parole is not so restrained as to permit the parolee to attack his conviction in habeas corpus proceedings. In some of those cases, upon which the Court of Appeals in this case also relied, the petitioner had been completely and unconditionally released from custody;14 such cases are obviously not controlling here where petitioner has not been unconditionally released. Other cases relied upon by respondent held merely that the dispute between the petitioner and the named respondent in each case had become moot because that particular respondent no longer held the petitioner in his custody.15 So here, as in the cases last mentioned, when the petitioner was placed on parole, his cause against the Superintendent of the Virginia State Penitentiary became moot because the superintendent's custody had come to an end, as much as if he had resigned his position with the State. But it does not follow that this petitioner is wholly without remedy. His motion to add the members of the Virginia Parole Board as parties respondent squarely raises the question, not presented in our earlier cases, of whether the Parole Board now holds the petitioner in its 'custody' within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241 so that he can by habeas corpus require the Parole Board to point to and defend the law by which it justifies any restraint on his liberty.\n\n\n7\nThe Virginia statute provides that a paroled prisoner shall be released 'into the custody of the Parole Board,'16 and the parole order itself places petitioner 'under the custody and control of the Virginia Parole Board.' And in fact, as well as in theory,17 the custody and control of the Parole Board involves significant restraints on petitioner's liberty because of his conviction and sentence, which are in addition to those imposed by the State upon the public generally. Petitioner is confined by the parole order to a particular community, house, and job at the sufferance of his parole officer. He cannot drive a car without permission. He must periodically report to his parole officer, permit the officer to visit his home and job at any time, and follow the officer's advice. He is admonished to keep good company and good hours, work regularly, keep away from undesirable places, and live a clean, honest, and temperate life. Petitioner must not only faithfully obey these restrictions and conditions but he must live in constant fear that a single deviation, however slight, might be enough to result in his being returned to prison to serve out the very sentence he claims was imposed upon him in violation of the United States Constitution. He can be rearrested at any time the Board or parole officer believes he has violated a term or condition of his parole,18 and he might be thrown back in jail to finish serving the allegedly invalid sentence with few, if any, of the procedural safeguards that normally must be and are provided to those charged with crime.19 It is not relevant that conditions and restrictions such as these20 may be desirable and important parts of the rehabilitative process; what matters is that they significantly restrain petitioner's liberty to do those things which in this country free men are entitled to do. Such restraints are enough to invoke the help of the Great Writ. Of course, that writ always could and still can reach behind prison walls and iron bars. But it can do more. It is not now and never has been a static, narrow, formalistic remedy; its scope has grown to achieve its grand purpose\u2014the protection of individuals against erosion of their right to be free from wrongful restraints upon their liaberty. While petitioner's parole releases him from immediate physical imprisonment, it imposes conditions which significantly confine and restrain his freedom; this is enough to keep him in the 'custody' of the members of the Virginia Parole Board within the meaning of the habeas corpus statute; if he can prove his allegations this custody is in violation of the Constitution, and it was therefore error for the Court of Appeals to dismiss his case as moot instead of permitting him to add the Parole Board members as respondents.\n\n\n8\nRespondent also argues that the District Court had no jurisdiction because the petitioner had left the territorial confines of the district. But this case is not like Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U.S. 188, 68 S.Ct. 1443, 92 L.Ed. 1898 (1948), upon which respondent relies, because in that case petitioners were not even detained in the district when they originally filed their petition. Rather, this case is controlled by our decision in Ex parte Endo, 323 U.S. 283, 304\u2014307, 65 S.Ct. 208, 219\u2014220, 89 L.Ed. 243 (1944), which held that a District Court did not lose its jurisdiction when a habeas corpus petitioner was removed from the district so long as an appropriate respondent with custody remained. Here the members of the Parole Board are still within the jurisdiction of the District Court, and they can be required to do all things necessary to bring the case to a final adjudication.\n\n\n9\nThe case is reversed and remanded to the Court of Appeals with directions to grant petitioner's motion to add the members of the Parole Board as respondents and proceed to a decision on the merits of petitioner's case.\n\n\n10\nReversed.\n\n\n\n1\n Parole in this case was granted while petitioner's appeal was pending in the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n2\n 'The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.'

{"text":"350 U.S. 148\n76 S.Ct. 219\n100 L.Ed. 149\nREX TRAILER COMPANY, Inc., Petitioner,v.UNITED STATES of America.\nNo. 46.\nArgued Dec. 5, 1955.\nDecided Jan. 9, 1956.\n\nMr. Gustav H. Dongus, Indianapolis, Ind., for petitioner.\nMr. Melvin Richter, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nMr. Justice CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner contends that this action brought by the Government to recover $2,000 on each of five counts of a complaint based on \u00a7 26(b)(1) of the Surplus Property Act of 19441 places it twice in jeopardy in violation of the Fifth Amendment. In an earlier proceeding it had pleaded nolo contendere to a five-count indictment bottomed on the same five transactions and paid fines in the aggregate amount of $25,000. In the present case the District Court granted the Government's motion for summary judgment, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, 218 F.2d 880. We granted certiorari, 349 U.S. 937, 75 S.Ct. 784, to resolve an asserted conflict between the decisions of the Courts of Appeals.2\n\n\n2\nAt the close of World War II the Government was faced with the problem of disposing of vast quantities of surplus war materials. A large part of this property, valued at many billions of dollars, was needed to satisfy the civilian demand caused by wartime shortages in consumer goods. To facilitate and regulate the orderly disposal of this property, Congress passed the Surplus Property Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 765. The stated purposes of this statute included the reestablishment of returning veterans in business, agricultural, or professional life, the discouragement of speculation in surplus property, and the elimination of unusual and excessive profits to speculators. The concern of Congress for returning veterans is emphasized by its 1946 Amendment to the Act, 60 Stat. 168, which gave veterans a priority for the purchase of surplus property, second only to that of the Federal Government, and authorized the Administrator to assign the highest priority to veterans for the purchase of certain items. This legislation thus afforded veterans an opportunity to purchase goods not available elsewhere at a fair price and on good credit terms. The benefits were of great value to the millions of men and women returning to civilian life just after the war.\n\n\n3\nWith this background in mind we may turn to the facts of the present case. In June 1947 the Rex Trailer Company purchased five motor vehicles from the War Assets Administration at Tinker Field, Oklahoma. Rex had only a nonpriority right of purchase under the Surplus Property Act; but, by the fraudulent use of the names of five persons possessing veteran priority rights, it was able to purchase the vehicles. Admittedly, the terms of the statute were violated, but the record does not show petitioner's gain from the fraud. The United States limited itself to the recovery of the sum of $2,000 for each of the five overt acts alleged in its complaint.\n\n\n4\nPetitioner's sole contention is that \u00a7 26(b)(1) provides a criminal penalty and, having once been convicted and fined for the transactions in question, it cannot again be subjected to punishment. The only question for our decision, then, is whether \u00a7 26(b)(1) is civil or penal, for 'Congress may impose both a criminal and a civil sanction in respect to the same act or omission; for the double jeopardy clause prohibits merely punishing twice, or attempting a second time to punish criminally, for the same offense.' Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U.S. 391, 399, 58 S.Ct. 630, 633, 82 L.Ed. 917.\n\n\n5\nWe conclude that the recovery here is civil in nature. The Government has the right to make contracts and hold and dispose of property, and, for the protection of its property rights, it may resort to the same remedies as a private person. Cotton v. United States, 11 How. 229, 13 L.Ed. 675. Liquidated damages are a well-known remedy, and in fact Congress has utilized this form of recovery in numerous situations. In all building contracts, for example, Congress has required the insertion of a liquidated-damage clause which 'shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties' without proof of 'actual or specific damages sustained * * *.' 32 Stat. 326, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 269*. Liquidated-damage provisions, when reasonable, are not to be regarded as penalties, United States v. United Engineering & Contracting Co., 234 U.S. 236, 241, 34 S.Ct. 843, 845, 58 L.Ed. 1294, and are therefore civil in nature.\n\n\n6\nIn \u00a7 26 of the Surplus Property Act, Congress has provided three alternative remedies. The first provides a recovery of $2,000 plus double the amount of the damage sustained; the second permits a recovery 'as liquidated damages' of twice the consideration agreed upon; the third permits the Government to recover the property and retain 'as liquidated damages' the consideration it received. These alternative remedies are set out in three consecutively numbered subsections of \u00a7 26(b). All three were recognized as civil remedies by Congress before the bill was passed,3 and the conclusion is inescapable that each was of the same nature and designed to serve the same purpose. Further, Congress provided in \u00a7 26(d) that: '(t)he civil remedies provided in this section shall be in addition to all other criminal penalties and civil remedies provided by law.'\n\n\n7\nThe case of United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U.S. 537, 63 S.Ct. 379, 87 L.Ed. 443, involved a provision of the False Claims Act, R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5438, 3490, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 231, 31 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 231, essentially the equivalent of \u00a7 26(b)(1).4 In Marcus, as here, the defendant had pleaded nolo contendere in an earlier criminal prosecution based on the same transaction. This Court rejected the petitioner's contention of double jeopardy and held that the statute involved was remedial and not penal, since it was unable to say that the provision for $2,000 plus double damages would 'do more than afford the government complete indemnity for the injuries done it.' 317 U.S. at page 549, 63 S.Ct. at page 387. In concluding, it recognized that '(t)he inherent difficulty of choosing a proper specific sum which would give full restitution was a problem for Congress.' 317 U.S. at page 552, 63 S.Ct. at page 388.\n\n\n8\nIt is insisted, however, that the failure of the Government to allege specific damages precludes recovery here. But there is no requirement, statutory or judicial, that specific damages be shown, and this was recognized by the Court in Marcus.5 The Government's recovery here is comparable to the recovery under liquidated-damage provisions which fix compensation for anticipated loss. As this Court recognized in Priebe & Sons v. United States, 332 U.S. 407, 411\u2014412, 68 S.Ct. 123, 126, 92 L.Ed. 32, liquidated damages 'serve a particularly useful function when damages are uncertain in nature or amount or are unmeasurable, as is the case in many government contracts. * * *' And the fact that no damages are shown is not fatal. Section 26(b)(1) merely accomplishes the intended result of Congress by authorizing a separate proceeding for the recovery of a lump sum in damages.\n\n\n9\nIt is obvious that injury to the Government resulted from the Rex Trailer Company's fraudulent purchase of trucks. It precluded bona fide sales to veterans, decreased the number of motor vehicles available to Government agencies, and tended to promote undesirable speculation.6 The damages resulting from this injury may be difficult or impossible to ascertain, but it is the function of liquidated damages to provide a measure of recovery in such circumstances. On this record it cannot be said that the measure of recovery fixed by Congress in the Act is so unreasonable or excessive that it transformed what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\n\n\n10\nAffirmed.\n\n\n11\nMr. Justice FRANKFURTER concurs in the judgment substantially for the reasons given by him in his opinion in support of the Marcus decision. 317 U.S. at page 553, 63 S.Ct. at page 388.\n\n\n\n1\n Section 26 of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 765, 780, 50 U.S.C.Appendix (1946 ed.) \u00a7 1635, now 40 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 489, provided in pertinent part:\n'(b) Every person who shall use or engage in or cause to be used or engaged in any fraudulent trick, scheme, or device, for the purpose of securing or obtaining, or aiding to secure or obtain, for any person any payment, property, or other benefits from the United States or any Government agency in connection with the disposition of property under this Act; or who enters into an agreement, combination, or conspiracy to do any of the foregoing\u2014\n'(1) shall pay to the United States the sum of $2,000 for each such act, and double the amount of any damage which the United States may have sustained by reason thereof, together with the costs of suit; or\n'(2) shall, if the United States shall so elect, pay to the United States, as liquidated damages, a sum equal to twice the consideration agreed to be given by such person to the United States or any Government agency; or\n'(3) shall, if the Unied States shall so elect, restore to the United States the property thus secured and obtained and the United States shall retain as liquidated damages any consideration given to the United States or any Government agency for such property.\n'(d) The civil remedies provided in this section shall be in addition to all other criminal penalties and civil remedies provided by law.'\n\n\n2\n In considering whether the statute of limitations contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2462, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2462, applied to \u00a7 26(b)(1) of the Surplus Property Act, the Fifth Circuit held \u00a7 26(b)(1) to be a civil remedy in United States v. Weaver, 207 F.2d 796, 797, and the Sixth Circuit held it to be penal in United States v. Witherspoon, 211 F.2d 858.\n\n\n3\n In referring to these provisions, the Senate Committee on Military Affairs described them as providing for 'the civil liability of persons who engaged in false, fraudulent, or fictitious activities, or conceal or misrepresent material facts, or act with intent to defraud the United States * * *. The United States is given the option of electing among three different measures of damages.' S.Rep. No. 1057, 78th Cong., 2d Sess. 13\u201414.\n\n\n*\n Now 41 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 256a.\n\n\n4\n The False Claims Act provides that the defrauder 'shall forfeit and pay to the United States the sum of 2,000, and, in addition, double the amount of damages which the United States may have sustained by reason of the doing or committing such act, together with the costs of suit; and such forfeiture and damages shall be sued for in the same suit.' United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, holding this provision to provide a compensatory civil remedy, was decided on January 18, 1943. The Surplus Property Act, which employed virtually identical language in \u00a7 26(b)(1), was enacted on October 3, 1944. Under these circumstances it would be very difficult to say that these words which provided a civil remedy in the False Claims Act were not intended to provide the same kind of remedy in the Surplus Property Act.\n\n\n5\n On several of the projects involved in the Marcus case, fraud was discovered by the Government in time for payments to be withheld. At trial in the District Court defendants urged that there could be no recovery of a penalty or forfeiture in these instances where no actual damage could be shown. The District Court held that failure to show actual damage in these instances would not preclude recovery under the statute. United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 41 F.Supp. 197, 218. The judgment of the District Court was affirmed here. See United States v. Rohleder, 3 Cir., 157 F.2d 126, 129.\n\n\n6\n It seems quite probable that there is also an element of unjust enrichment to the Rex Trailer Company from its fraudulent purchases. The record is silent on this point and we have not considered it in arriving at our decision, but the fact that Rex was willing to resort to fraud to purchase the vehicles at the veteran's price strongly suggests at the fair gain from the purchases. The price for sales to priority purchasers was fixed by regulations published in 32 CFR (1946 Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 8302.8(d), 8302.11, which provided: 'Disposal agencies shall fix the fair value at which property shall be acquired by priority claimants. Such a fair value shall not be greater than the lowest price which is offered to any trade level at the time of acquisition by the priority claimant, or where the fair value is fixed after examining competitive bids, it shall not be greater than the lowest acceptable bid.'\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"392 U.S. 286\n88 S.Ct. 1978.\n20 L.Ed.2d 1094\nGEORGE CAMPBELL PAINTING CORP., Appellant,v.William REID et al.\nNo. 673.\nArgued April 30, 1968.\nDecided June 10, 1968.\n\nAlbert A. Blinder, New York City, for appellant.\nPaul W. Hessel and Samuel A. Hirshowitz, New York City, for appellees.\nMr. Justice FORTAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe Public Authorities Law of New York, McKinney's Consol.Laws, c. 43\u2014A, \u00a7 2601, provides that a clause must be inserted in all contracts awarded by a public authority of the State for work or services to provide that upon refusal of 'a person' to testify before a grand jury, to answer any relevant question, or to waive immunity against subsequent criminal prosecution, such person and any firm or corporation of which he is a member, officer, or director shall be disqualified for five years from contracting with any public authority, and any existing contracts may be canceled by the public authority without incurring any penalty or damages.1\n\n\n2\nDuring 1964, appellant, a closely held family corporation, entered into three painting contracts with appellee New York City Housing Authority. Each of these contained the standard disqualification clause. The contracts were executed by appellant's president, George Campbell, Jr., who was also a director and stockholder of the corporation.\n\n\n3\nEarly in 1965, appellant became aware that the District Attorney of New York County was conducting an investigation before a grand jury of alleged bid rigging on public contracts, including those of appellant. Thereafter, George Campbell, Jr., resigned as appellant's president and director and divested himself of his stock. He remained in appellant's employ as an 'estimator.'\n\n\n4\nA few weeks thereafter, Campbell was subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. He refused to sign the waiver of immunity. In due course, the Public Housing Authority notified appellant that, pursuant to the provision in its contracts, the contracts were terminated and Campbell and the corporation were disqualified from doing business with the Authority for five years.\n\n\n5\nAfter proceedings in the lower courts of New York, the New York Court of Appeals denied relief to appellant. It held that the disqualification was valid and that \u00a7 2601 of the Public Authorities Law is constitutional, citing Gardner v. Broderick, 20 N.Y.2d 227, 282 N.Y.S.2d 487, 229 N.E.2d 184 (1967) (reversed this day, 392 U.S. 273, 88 S.Ct. 1913, 20 L.Ed.2d 1082). The Court of Appeals also rejected appellant's claim that it should not have been disqualified because Campbell resigned as president and director before he was called to testify.2 We noted probable jurisdiction. 390 U.S. 918, 88 S.Ct. 848, 19 L.Ed.2d 978 (1968).\n\n\n6\nWe do not consider the constitutionality of \u00a7 2601 of New York's Public Authorities Law or the validity or effect of the contract provisions incorporating that section. Appellant's claim is that these provisions operated unconstitutionally to require its president, Mr. Campbell, to waive the benefits of his privilege against self-incrimination. But appellant cannot avail itself of this point, assuming its validity. It has long been settled in federal jurisprudence that the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is 'essentially a personal one, applying only to natural individuals.' It 'cannot be utilized by or on behalf of any organization, such as a corporation.' United States v. White, 322 U.S. 694, 698, 699, 64 S.Ct. 1248, 1251, 83 L.Ed. 1542 (1944); see also Essgee Co. v. United States, 262 U.S. 151, 43 S.Ct. 514, 67 L.Ed. 917 (1923); Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. ICC, 221 U.S. 612, 622, 31 S.Ct. 621, 626, 55 L.Ed. 878 (1911); Wilson v. United States, 221 U.S. 361, 382\u2014385, 31 S.Ct. 538, 945 946, 55 L.Ed. 771 (1911); Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 74\u201475, 26 S.Ct. 370, 378\u2014379, 50 L.Ed. 652 (1906). If a corporation cannot avail itself of the privilege against self- incrimination, it cannot take advantage of the claimed invalidity of a penalty imposed for refusal of an individual, its president, to waive the privilege. Since the privilege is not available to it, appellant, a corporation, cannot invoke the privilege to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 2601 of the Public Authorities Law. A fortiori, it cannot assail the validity of the provision in the contracts into which it entered, incorporating the substance of that section.\n\n\n7\nAs to appellant's claim that its due process rights were denied by the imposition of the penalty despite Mr. Campbell's purported resignation from managerial positions, we do not reach the abstract legal question that is urged upon us. We see no reason to disturb the finding of the New York Court of Appeals that 'the resignation was tendered and accepted solely for the purpose of avoiding the statutory disqualification,' and the conclusion of that court that the purported resignation should be disregarded for purposes of this case.\n\n\n8\nAffirmed.\n\n\n9\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK concurs, dissenting.\n\n\n10\nAppellant corporation has been disqualified as a contractor with the State of New York because its president, George Campbell, Jr., who was also a director and an owner of 10% of its stock, invoked the protection of the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment when summond before the grand jury. All other officers, directors, and the controlling stockholders of this closely held corporation appeared and indicated a willingness to sign waivers of immunity and to testify. The president, who invoked the Self-Incrimination Clause, resigned as officer and director and agreed to sell his 10% stock interest, though so far as appears the contract of sale has not been consummated.1\n\n\n11\nIn the old days when a culprit, unpopular person, or suspect was punished by a bill of attainder, the penalty imposed often reached not only his own property, but also interests of his family.2 When the present law blacklists this family corporation, it has a like impact.\n\n\n12\nI fail to see how any penalty\u2014direct or collateral\u2014can be imposed on anyone for invoking a constitutional guarantee. A corporation, to be sure, is not a beneficiary of the Self-Incrimination Clause, in the sense that it may invoke it. United States v. White, 322 U.S. 694, 64 S.Ct. 1248, 88 L.Ed. 1542. Yet placing this family corporation on the blacklist and disqualifying it from doing business with the State of New York is one way of reaching the economic interest of the recalcitrant president.3 If, as I felt in Spevack v. Klein, 385 U.S. 511, 87 S.Ct. 625, 17 L.Ed.2d 574, placing the penalty of disbarment on a lawyer for invoking the Self-Incrimination Clause is unconstitutional, so is placing a monetary penalty on a businessman for doing the same.4 Reducing the value of appellant corporation by putting it on the State's blacklist is a penalty which every stockholder suffers. If New York provided that where a businessman invokes the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment he shall forfeit, say, $10,000, the law would plainly be unconstitutional as exacting a penalty for asserting a constitutional privilege. What New York could not do directly, it may not do indirectly. Yet penalizing this man's family corporation for his assertion of immunity has precisely that effect.\n\n\n13\nThe Supremacy Clause of the Constitution (Art. VI, cl. 2) gives the Fifth Amendment, now applicable to the States by reason of the Fourteenth, controlling authority over New York's law.\n\n\n\n1\n Section 2602 provides for disqualification on the same basis without reference to any contractual clause.\n\n\n2\n The Court of Appeals noted that \u00a7 2603 of the Public Authorities Act vests the State Supreme Court with jurisdiction, for stated reasons, to remove the disqualification.\n\n\n1\n One of the directors of the corporation testified before appellee New York City Housing Authority that no consideration was paid for the stock at the time of transfer, and that there was as yet no formal or informal agreement as to payment for the stock.\nMoreover, the pleadings reveal that George Campbell, Jr., was at all times relevant here a 10% residuary legatee under the estate of his late father. That estate contained 50% of the stock of appellant corporation. Thus, George Campbell, Jr., possessed a substantial additional interest in the corporation which would likely be affected by any increase or decrease in the value of the stock.\n\n\n2\n E.g., Delaware Laws 1778, c. 29b; New Jersey, Act of Dec. 11, 1778, N.J.Rev.Laws 40 (Paterson ed. 1800). Compare North Carolina Laws, Session of April 14, 1778, c. 5, calling for confiscation of the estates of certain persons 'inimical to the United States,' but specifically providing that members of their families should be allowed that portion of the estate forfeited which they might have enjoyed had the owner died intestate. See also Bayard v. Singleton, 1 Martin's N.C.Rep. 42 (1878). And see Comment, The Supreme Court's Bill of Attainder Doctrine: A Need for Clarification, 54 Calif.L.Rev. 212, 214, 216 (1966).\n\n\n3\n Damage to shareholders which results indirectly from damage done to the corporation can, of course, be rectified through suit by the corporation itself or by a stockholder's derivative action. E.g., Paulson v. Margolis, 234 App.Div. 496, 255 N.Y.S. 568 (Sup.Ct. 1932). See generally Ballantine, Corporations 333\u2014339 (1946); 13 Flectcher Cyclopedia, Corporations \u00a7\u00a7 5908\u20145911 (1961). There is no indication in the opinion of the New York Court of Appeals that that remedy is inappropriate on the facts of this case.\n\n\n4\n The fact that appellant may petition the New York courts for discretionary relief under \u00a7 2603 of the New York Public Authorities Law does not cure the defect. For appellant's claim is that its disqualification was improper, and that it was penalized pursuant to an unconstitutional statute. Its remedy cannot be limited by \u00a7 2603, which was construed by the New York Court of Appeals below to grant the state courts discretion to afford relief from a proper disaqualification when the application of the statute would cause an unnecessary hardship. Indeed, \u00a7 2603 by its terms does not even involve a review of the basis for the disqualification, but provides that any disqualified corporation may apply to the New York Supreme Court to discontinue the disqualification:\n'Such application shall be in the form of a petition setting forth grounds, including that the cooperation by petitioner with the grand jury at the time of the refusal was such, and the amount and degree of control and financial interest, if any, in the petitioning firm, partnership or corporation by the member, partner, officer or director who refused to waive immunity is such that it will not be in the public interest to cancel or terminate petitioner's contracts or to continue the disqualification * * *.'\n\n\n","label":0}

MacCOLLOM.\nNo. 74-1487.\nArgued March 29, 1976.\nDecided June 10, 1976.\n\nSyllabus\nNearly two years after his conviction of a federal crime, from which he took no appeal, respondent, Pro se, filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, in which he asserted that he intended to seek vacation of his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; that he was unable to afford a transcript; that without one he could not frame his arguments for effective review; that a transcript would show that he had not been afforded effective assistance of counsel; and that there was insufficient evidence to support the guilty verdict. The District Court, after granting respondent leave to proceed In forma pauperis, appointing counsel, and holding a hearing, denied relief. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent was entitled to a transcript in order to assist him in preparing a motion under \u00a7 2255. The court concluded that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f), which provides for a free transcript for indigent prisoners asserting a claim under \u00a7 2255 if the trial judge certifies that the asserted claim is \"not frivolous\" and that the transcript is \"needed to decide the issue,\" does not prohibit courts from requiring the Government to supply an indigent prisoner with a free transcript Before he files a \u00a7 2255 motion. By so ruling the court felt that it was unnecessary to hold \u00a7 753(f) unconstitutional. Held : The judgment is reversed. Pp. 320-329; (Rehnquist, J., opinion); pp. 329-330 (Blackmun, J., opinion).\n511 F.2d 1116, reversed.\nMr. Justice Rehnquist, joined by Mr. Chief Justice Burger, Mr. Justice Stewart, and Mr. Justice Powell, concluded:\n1. Section 753(f) does not violate Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2, by constituting a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. The right to a free transcript is not a necessary concomitant of the writ, which operated until 1944 with no provision at all for free transcripts for indigents. If Congress thus could have limited the writ directly without \"suspending\" it, Congress may do so indirectly. Pp. 322-323.\n2. Nor does \u00a7 753(f) violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and respondent's right to \"equal protection,\" since respondent, to whom the transcript was available had he chosen to appeal his conviction, and remained available on the conditions set forth in \u00a7 753, had an adequate opportunity to attack his conviction. Pp. 323-328.\n(a) The Due Process Clause does not establish a right of appeal, and \u00a7 753(f)' \u00a7 conditions are not \"so arbitrary and unreasonable . . . as to require their invalidation,\" Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 365, 83 S.Ct. 814, 820, 9 L.Ed.2d 811, 819 (Harlan, J., dissenting). Pp. 323-324.\n(b) Though those statutory conditions place an indigent in a position somewhat less advantageous than that of a person of means, the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause does not guarantee absolute equality, the conditions of \u00a7 753(f) providing an adequate access to procedures for review of the conviction of an indigent, who, like respondent, chose to forgo his opportunity for a direct appeal with its attendant free transcript. Pp. 324-328.\nMr. Justice Blackmun concluded that \u00a7 753(f) afforded respondent a fair and adequate opportunity to present his claims effectively in this collateral proceeding, and that it is not necessary to consider the constitutional significance of what respondent might have done at the time he could have directly appealed his conviction. Pp. 329-330.\nFrank H. Easterbrook, Washington, D. C., pro hac vice, by special leave of Court for petitioner.\nJohn A. Strait, Tacoma, Wash., for respondent.\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST announced the judgment of the Court in an opinion in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice STEWART, and Mr. Justice POWELL join.\n\n\n1\nThis case presents the question of whether the restrictions imposed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753 on the availability to an indigent prisoner of a free trial transcript to aid him in preparing a petition for collateral relief are consistent with the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in contrast to every other Court of Appeals which has ruled on the issue, held that such prisoners have an absolute right to a transcript. We reverse.\n\n\n2\n* Respondent was convicted of uttering forged currency in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 472 after a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. On June 3, 1970, he was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment. He did not appeal. Nearly two years later respondent, acting Pro se, filed in the District Court a paper designated \"Motion for Transcript in Forma Pauperis.\" This was returned to respondent with the advice that he first had to file a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 before the court could act on his request for a transcript.\n\n\n3\nRespondent then filed a \"complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Injunctive Relief\" in which he alleged that he \"intends to move this Court for vacation of his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\" He asserted that he was unable to afford a transcript, that a transcript would show that he had not been afforded effective assistance of counsel, and that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict of guilty. The complaint further alleged that without a transcript respondent would be \"unable to frame his arguments for fair and effective review.\" The complaint did not elaborate upon respondent's two asserted grounds for relief.\n\n\n4\nThe District Court treated this pleading as a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, granted respondent leave to proceed In forma pauperis, appointed counsel, and held a hearing. After the hearing the court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Respondent appealed, and a divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed, 511 F.2d 1116 (1974), holding that respondent was entitled to a transcript \"in order to assist him in the preparation of a postconviction motion under 28 U.S.C. (s) 2255.\" Id., at 1124.\n\nII\n\n5\nCongress has expressly addressed the question of furnishing transcripts at public expense in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f), which provides in pertinent part:\n\n\n6\n\"Fees for transcripts furnished in criminal proceedings to      persons proceeding under the Criminal Justice Act (18 U.S.C.      (s) 3006A), or in habeas corpus proceedings to persons      allowed to sue, defend, or appeal in forma pauperis, shall be      paid by the United States out of moneys appropriated for      those purposes. Fees for transcripts furnished in proceedings      brought under section 2255 of this title to persons permitted      to sue or appeal in forma pauperis shall be paid by the      United States out of money appropriated for that purpose if      the trial judge or a circuit judge certifies that the suit or      appeal is not frivolous and that the transcript is needed to      decide the issue presented by the suit or appeal. . . . \"\n\n\n7\nThe statute thus provides for a free transcript for indigent prisoners asserting a claim under \u00a7 2255 if a judge certifies that the asserted claim is \"not frivolous\" and that the transcript is \"needed to decide the issue.\" The District Court, by its conclusion that respondent failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, implicitly decided one of these two issues against respondent.\n\n\n8\nThe Court of Appeals held that it was not necessary to declare \u00a7 753(f) unconstitutional in order to grant respondent relief. Rather, the court held that the section \"does not prohibit courts from . . . requiring the government to supply an imprisoned indigent with a free transcript Before he files a 2255 motion. Such a court order would simply fill a constitutional deficit not addressed by the statute.\" (Emphasis added.) 511 F.2d, at 1119-1120.\n\n\n9\nThis is a novel approach to statutory construction. The established rule is that the expenditure of public funds is proper only when authorized by Congress, not that public funds may be expended unless prohibited by Congress. Reeside v. Walker, 11 How. 272, 291, 13 L.Ed. 693 (1851). This particular statute contains a limited grant of authority to the courts to authorize the expenditure of public funds for furnishing transcripts to plaintiffs in \u00a7 2255 actions. The fact that the statute does not \"prohibit\" the furnishing of free transcripts in other circumstances is of little significance, since most such statutes speak only in terms of granting authority for the expenditure of federal funds. Where Congress has addressed the subject as it has here, and authorized expenditures where a condition is met, the clear implication is that where the condition is not met, the expenditure is not authorized. Botany Worsted Mills v. United States, 278 U.S. 282, 289, 49 S.Ct. 129, 131, 73 L.Ed. 379 (1929); Passenger Corp. v. Passengers Assn., 414 U.S. 453, 458, 94 S.Ct. 690, 693, 38 L.Ed.2d 646 (1974).1\n\n\n10\nIt is true, as respondent observes, that the statute, as currently written, distinguishes between habeas corpus petitioners and parties proceeding under \u00a7 2255 in that only the latter must make a showing of need and nonfrivolousness in order to obtain a free transcript. Thus while it is still true that the \"remedy\" afforded by \u00a7 2255 is \"exactly commensurate with that which had previously been available by habeas corpus . . . ,\" Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. 424, 427, 82 S.Ct. 468, 471, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962), the right to pursue that remedy with a free transcript has now been somewhat limited by Congress.2 Respondent argues that this constitutes a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in violation of Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2, of the Constitution.\n\n\n11\nThis argument presupposes, Inter alia, that a right to a free transcript is a necessary concomitant of the writ which the Founders declared could not be suspended. This is obviously not the case. The writ of habeas corpus operated until 1944 with no provision for free transcripts for indigents. See 58 Stat. 6, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 9a (1940 ed., Supp. IV). Congress, when in that year it authorized free transcripts for the first time, could certainly have limited the authorization to nonfrivolous cases where a need had been shown. IfCongress could have thus limited the writ directly without \"suspending\" it, it follows that it may do so indirectly. The only possible objection is a Fifth Amendment due process-equal protection claim, to which we now turn.\n\nIII\n\n12\nThe Court of Appeals did not technically decide this constitutional issue, since it thought it had discovered a lacuna in the statute, but its reference to a \"constitutional deficit\" suggests its view on this question. Respondent urges that if the statute is read as we now read it, it violates both the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and his right to \"equal protection.\"\n\n\n13\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not establish any right to an appeal, see Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 18, 76 S.Ct. 585, 590, 100 L.Ed. 891 (1956) (plurality opinion), and certainly does not establish any right to collaterally attack a final judgment of conviction.3 In this case respondent was granted a statutory right of appeal without payment of costs if he were an indigent, and had he pursued that right \u00a7 753(f) would have authorized the use of public funds to furnish him a transcript of the trial proceedings without any further showing on his part. Having forgone this right, which existed by force of statute only, he may not several years later successfully assert a due process right to review of his conviction and thereby obtain a free transcript on his own terms as an ancillary constitutional benefit. The conditions which Congress had imposed on obtaining such a transcript in \u00a7 753(f) are not \"so arbitrary and unreasonable . . . as to require their invalidation,\" Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 365, 83 S.Ct. 814, 820, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963) (Harlan, J., dissenting); rather they \"comport with fair procedure,\" id., at 357, 83 S.Ct., at 816 (Court's opinion).\n\n\n14\nAlthough the statutory conditions established in \u00a7 753(f) with respect to furnishing a free transcript to movants in \u00a7 2255 proceedings are therefore consistent with the due process requirements of the Fifth Amendment, it is undoubtedly true that they place an indigent in a somewhat less advantageous position than a person of means. But neither the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, nor the counterpart equal protection requirement embodied in the Fifth Amendment, guarantees \"absolute equality or precisely equal advantages,\" San Antonio School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 24, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 1291, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973). In the context of a criminal proceeding they require only \"an adequate opportunity to present (one's) claims fairly . . . .\" Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600, 616, 94 S.Ct. 2437, 2447, 41 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974).\n\n\n15\nIn Douglas v. California, supra, the Court held that the State must provide counsel for an indigent on his first appeal as of right. But in Ross v. Moffitt, supra, we declined to extend that holding to a discretionary second appeal from an intermediate appellate court to the Supreme Court of North Carolina. We think the distinction between these two holdings of the Court is of considerable assistance in resolving respondent's equal protection claim. Respondent in this case had an opportunity for direct appeal, and had he chosen to pursue it he would have been furnished a free transcript of the trial proceedings. But having forgone that right, and instead some years later having sought to obtain a free transcript in order to make the best case he could in a proceeding under \u00a7 2255, respondent stands in a different position.\n\n\n16\nThe Court has held that when a State grants a right to collateral review, it may not deny the right to an indigent simply because of inability to pay the required filing fee, Smith v. Bennett, 365 U.S. 708, 81 S.Ct. 895, 6 L.Ed.2d 39 (1961). There is no such impediment here; respondent was permitted to proceed In forma pauperis in his \u00a7 2255 action. The Court has also held that a State may not confide to the public defender the final decision as to whether a transcript shall be available to the criminal defendant who collaterally attacks his conviction, Lane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477, 83 S.Ct. 768, 9 L.Ed.2d 892 (1963). There the Court observed that the state provision \"confers upon a state officer outside the judicial system power to take from an indigent all hope of any appeal at all.\" Id., at 485, 83 S.Ct., at 773.\n\n\n17\nThe congressional statute governing the furnishing of free transcripts to plaintiffs in \u00a7 2255 actions has no such infirmity. The decision as to the provisions of the transcript at public expense is made initially by an official at the very heart of the judicial system a district judge in the judicial district in which the \u00a7 2255 plaintiff was tried. The district court has the power to order a free transcript furnished if it finds that the \"suit . . . is not frivolous and that the transcript is needed to decide the issue presented . . . .\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f).\n\n\n18\nWe think that the formula devised by Congress satisfies the equal protection components of the Fifth Amendment. Respondent chose to forgo his opportunity for direct appeal with its attendant unconditional free transcript. This choice affects his later equal protection claim as well as his due process claim. Equal protection does not require the Government to furnish to the indigent a delayed duplicate of a right of appeal with attendant free transcript which it offered in the first instance, even though a criminal defendant of means might well decide to purchase such a transcript in pursuit of relief under \u00a7 2255. The basic question is one of adequacy of respondent's access to procedures for review of his conviction, Ross v. Moffitt, supra, and it must be decided in the light of avenues which respondent chose not to follow as well as those he now seeks to widen. We think it enough at the collateral-relief stage that Congress has provided that the transcript be pd for by public funds if one demonstrates to a district judge that his \u00a7 2255 claim is not frivolous, and that the transcript is needed to decide the issue presented.\n\n\n19\nRespondent urged in oral argument that if trial counsel had done a poor job of representing a criminal defendant, such counsel might well urge the defendant to forgo his right of appeal in order to prevent a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel from being raised on the appeal. It is certainly conceivable that such a state of facts might exist, notwithstanding the fidelity to the interest of their clients demonstrated repeatedly by the overwhelming majority of the members of the legal profession. But \u00a7 753(f) does not require that a \u00a7 2255 plaintiff must Prove his claim in order to obtain a transcript, but only that he convince the district court that such claim is not frivolous. Had the District Court here been confronted not with merely a conclusory allegation, but with some factual allegations indicating a denial of respondent's Sixth Amendment right to counsel, together with an additional explicit assertion that trial counsel had urged respondent to forgo his appeal, that court might have concluded that such a claim was not frivolous, and further decided that a free transcript should be furnished pursuant to \u00a7 753(f).4\n\n\n20\nBut at is not our case. Respondent made only a naked allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. Since any discussion he may have had with his trial counsel as to the desirability of appeal would not normally appear in the transcript of proceedings at trial, the furnishing of such transcript would not have aided him in refreshing his recollection of such discussions. The failure to flesh out this aspect of respondent's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, then, is not likely to have been cured by a transcript.\n\n\n21\nWe think this is an area of the law where the opinions of the courts of appeals are entitled to particular weight, since they represent not only expositions of federal and constitutional law, but also expressions of essentially practical judgment on questions which those courts must confront far more than we do. The fact that with the exception of the decision presently under review they have unanimously concluded that the conditions established by \u00a7 753(f) for the furnishing of a free transcript do not violate the Fifth Amendment is significant.5 A practical reason for their conclusion is well expressed by Judge Haynsworth in United States v. Shoaf, 341 F.2d 832 (CA4 1964), in which he said for that court:\n\n\n22\n\"The usual grounds for successful collateral attacks upon      convictions arise out of occurrences outside of the courtroom or of events in the courtroom of which      the defendant was aware and can recall without the need of      having his memory refreshed by reading a transcript. He may      well have a need of a transcript (to support his claim) but      rarely, if ever, . . . to become aware of the events or      occurrences which constitute a ground for collateral attack.\"      Id., at 835.6\n\n\n23\nWe conclude that the fact that a transcript was available had respondent chosen to appeal from his conviction, and remained available on the conditions set forth in \u00a7 753 to an indigent proceeding under \u00a7 2255, afforded respondent an adequate opportunity to attack his conviction. To hold otherwise would be to place the indigent defendant in a more favorable position than a similarly situated prisoner of some, but not unlimited, means, who presumably would make an evaluation much like that prescribed in \u00a7 753(f) before he spent his own funds for a transcript.\n\n\n24\n\"(T)he fact that a particular service might be of benefit to      an indigent defendant does not mean that the service is      constitutionally required. The duty of the State under our      cases is not to duplicate the legal arsenal that may be      privately retained by a criminal defendant in a continuing      effort to reverse his conviction, but only to assure the      indigent defendant an adequate opportunity to present his      claims fairly in the context of the State's appellate      process.\" Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S., at 616, 94 S.Ct., at      2447.\n\n\n25\nThe dgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is Reversed.\n\n\n26\nReversed.\n\n\n27\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN, concurring in the judgment.\n\n\n28\nI am in complete accord with what is said in n. 1 of the plurality opinion, Ante, at 321-322, regarding Mr. Justice STEVENS' dissent. It is not this Court's function to rewrite 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f) in order to reflect as that dissent appears to me to urge what may be regarded as sound policy for the administration of our criminal justice system.\n\n\n29\nI write separately, however, to emphasize the narrowness of the constitutional issue that is before us and the ease of its resolution. The answer to this case lies, I think, in the fact that respondent MacCollom has a Current opportunity to present his claims fairly, and we need not consider the constitutional significance of what he might have done at the time a direct appeal from his conviction could have been taken.\n\n\n30\nFor me, the issue in this case is whether the Constitution requires that a transcript be provided when an indigent makes no showing, with any degree of particularity, that he requires the transcript in order to make an effective collateral attack on his conviction. The crucial inquiry, as the Court said in the analogous Fourteenth Amendment context, is whether \u00a7 753(f) affords indigents \"an adequate opportunity to present their claims fairly within the adversary system.\" Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600, 612, 94 S.Ct. 2437, 2447, 41 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974).\n\n\n31\nHere, respondent was permitted to proceed In forma pauperis, and counsel was appointed for him. In order for him to obtain a transcript of his trial, he was required to show only that his claim was not frivolous and that there was a basis, grounded on Some articulable facts, for believing that transcript would assist him in his \u00a7 2255 proceeding. Clearly, there is no constitutional requirement that the United States provide an indigent with a transcript when that transcript is not necessary in order for him to prove his claim, or when his claim is frivolous on its face. Nor does the Constitution require that an indigent be furnished every possible legal tool, no matter how speculative its value, and no matter how devoid of assistance it may be, merely because a person of unlimited means might choose to waste his resources in a quest of that kind.\n\n\n32\nThe way was thus open for respondent to present his claim fairly within the very bounds of \u00a7 753(f). One need go no further. I therefore join the judgment reversing the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n33\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting.\n\n\n34\nI join my Brother STEVENS' dissent but add this separate dissent to record my disagreement with the plurality's view that the Government's refusal to furnish an indigent defendant a free trial transcript in a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, upon merely a showing of indigency, does not deny respondent equal protection of the laws secured against the Federal Government, as the plurality concedes, through the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 87, 96 S.Ct. 612, 670, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 638, 95 S.Ct. 1225, 1228, 43 L.Ed.2d 514 n. 2 (1975).\n\n\n35\n\"(T)he central aim of our entire judicial system (is that) all people charged with crime must, so far as the law is concerned, 'stand on an equality before the bar of justice in every American court,' \" Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 17, 76 S.Ct. 585, 590, 100 L.Ed. 891 (1956), (plurality opinion), for this is a \"country dedicated to affording equal justice to all and special privileges to none in the administration of its criminal law.\" Id., at 19, 76 S.Ct., at 591. \"Our decisions for more than a decade now he made clear that differences in access to the instruments needed to vindicate legal rights, when based upon the financial situation of the defendant, are repugnant to the Constitution.\" Roberts v. LaVallee, 389 U.S. 40, 42, 88 S.Ct. 194, 196, 19 L.Ed.2d 41 (1967). Thus, in Griffin, the Court held that \"(d)estitute defendants must be afforded as adequate appellate review as defendants who have money enough to buy transcripts,\" 351 U.S., at 19, 76 S.Ct., at 591, and that therefore the State must furnish the indigent defendant with a free trial transcript for purposes of direct appeal.\n\n\n36\nThe Griffin principle of equality was not limited to transcripts for purposes of direct appellate review. In Smith v. Bennett, 365 U.S. 708, 81 S.Ct. 895, 6 L.Ed.2d 39 (1961), the Court invalidated a filing fee for state habeas corpus as applied to indigents. The invalidation was held to be required by an earlier decision holding that a State could not require an indigent to pay a filing fee before being allowed to appeal in one of its courts. Burns v. Ohio, 360 U.S. 252, 79 S.Ct. 1164, 3 L.Ed.2d 1209 (1959). Later, Lane v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477, 484, 83 S.Ct. 768, 773, 9 L.Ed.2d 892 (1963), held that \"Smith makes clear that the Griffin principle also applies to state collateral proceedings . . . .\"\n\n\n37\nThe Griffin equality principle was next applied to appeals from state habeas proceedings. In Long v. District Court of Iowa, 385 U.S. 192, 87 S.Ct. 362, 17 L.Ed.2d 290 (1966), the Court, stating that \"having established a post-conviction procedure, a State cannot condition its availability to an indigent upon any financial consideration,\" held that an indigent defendant must be furnished a free transcript of his state habeas proceedings for purposes of appeal from a denial of that relief. Id., at 194, 87 S.Ct., at 364. And in Gardner v. California, 393 U.S. 367, 89 S.Ct. 580, 21 L.Ed.2d 601 (1969), the Court went still further and required the furnishing of a transcript of a habeas proceeding for the purposes of a second such proceeding. Thus, the plurality's opinion today that respondent may be required to show more than indigency before being entitled to his trial transcript for purposes of collateral view is a plain departure from Griffin and its progeny.\n\n\n38\nThe denial in this case is particularly egregious, for one of respondent's claims on the merits is that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Substantiation of such a claim is virtually impossible without the aid of a trial transcript. Yet the plurality denigrates respondent's claim as a \"naked allegation.\" Ante, at 327. Essentially, therefore, he is denied a transcript for making an unsubstantiated allegation, an allegation that obviously he cannot establish without a transcript.1\n\n\n39\nIt bears emphasis that where, as here, denial of equal protection is the issue, it matters not, under our cases, that the indigent had a fair opportunity to present a defense and have his conviction reviewed on direct appeal. The unfairness born of discrimination denying equal protection is as offensive to the Constitution as any unfairness resulting from procedural deficiencies in the criminal system. Thus, I cannot accept the plurality's argument that respondent could constitutionally be denied a free transcript because \"(r)espondent in this case had an opportunity for direct appeal, and had he chosen to pursue it he would have been furnished a free transcript of the trial proceedings.\" Ante, at 324. The Constitution demands that respondent, despite his indigency, be afforded the same opportunity for collateral review of his conviction as the nonindigent.2 \"If (the Government) has a general policy of allowing (collateral relief), it cannot make lack of means an effective bar to the exercise of this opportunity. The (Government) cannot keep the word of promise to the ear of those illegally convicted and break it to their hope.\" Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S., at 24, 76 S.Ct., at 593 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment).\n\n\n40\nThe plurality's reliance, Ante, at 324, upon Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600, 616, 94 S.Ct. 2437, 2447, 41 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974), for the proposition that \"(i) n the context of a criminal proceeding (equal protection) require(s) only 'an adequate opportunity to present (one's) claim(s) fairly' \" is patently misplaced. This quotation from Ross, read in context, speaks not merely to equality of opportunity in the overall criminal process, but also to equality of opportunity at any stage of the process where the validity of the defendant's restraint or conviction is the primary consideration.\n\n\n41\nI reject as wholly fallacious the argument that adequacy of opportunity to present claims at trial and on direct appeal so far diminishes the importance of collateral review, that discrimination between indigent and nonindigent in post-conviction proceedings is constitutionally tolerable. That argument is implicitly if not explicitly rejected in the unbroken line of our decisions that make no distinction, for purposes of equal protection analysis, between collateral proceedings and trials and direct appeals. Any distinction must necessarily be constitutionally intolerable where the stakes are no less than the constitutionality of a criminal conviction. Any distinction would also be plainly inconsistent with the explicit recognition given habeas corpus in Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2, of the Constitution. See Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 399-403, 83 S.Ct. 822, 827, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963). And for federal prisoners, \"history makes clear that \u00a7 2255 was intended to afford federal prisoners aremedy identical in scope to federal habeas corpus.\" Davis v. United States, 417 U.S. 333, 343, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 2304, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974).\n\n\n42\nToday's decision empties of all promise the Court's assurance only six years ago that decisions applying Griffin \"have pointedly demonstrated that the passage of time has heightened rather than weakened the attempts (by this Court) to mitigate the disparate treatment of indigents in the criminal process.\" Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 241, 90 S.Ct. 2018, 2022, 26 L.Ed.2d 586 (1970). I dissent.\n\n\n43\nMr. Justice STEVENS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN, Mr. Justice WHITE, and Mr. Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting.\n\n\n44\nThe decisive question in this case is whether, in judging the sufficiency of respondent's motion, we should assume that his allegations are true.\n\n\n45\nHe has alleged that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction, but that he did not appeal. If he had appealed, respondent would have obtained the transcript of the trial at Government expense.1 He has also alleged that his lawyer did not provide him with the effective representation at trial that the Sixth Amendment requires, and that this conclusion would be supported by an examination of the trial transcript. Respondent has neither the training nor the memory to allege the factual basis for that conclusion. If, however, that conclusion is accurate, he is entitled not only to a transcript but to a new trial.\n\n\n46\nAs the plurality points out, there are legitimate reasons for holding that respondent's allegations are not specific enough. In most cases the pleader should be able to set forth more factual details to support his ultimate conclusion. If respondent's pleading is adequate, almost any general statement claiming ineffective assistance of counsel would entitle a prisoner to a transcript in a proceeding under \u00a7 2255. In short, the right to a transcript at that stage would be almost as automatic as when a direct appeal is taken. Thus, in a sense, this case presents the question whether the defendant's right to a transcript at Government expense should survive if he fails to take a direct appeal.\n\n\n47\nThere are two reasons why I would answer that question in the affirmative and accept respondent's allegations at face value for purposes of determining whether his motion is frivolous and whether a transcript is necessary to decide the claims he asserts.\n\n\n48\nFirst, \u00a7 753(f) should be interpreted to establish a standard of nonfrivolousness and need that may be fairly administered. The statute itself does not address the standard that judges are to use in determining \"that the suit or appeal is not frivolous and that the transcript is needed to decide the issue presented by the suit or appeal,\" and the legislative history is also silent on the question.2 The plurality reads the statute to impose upon the \u00a7 2255 movant the burden of putting forward \"some factual allegations\" indicating a denial of constitutional rights, Ante, at 326, but this reading creates the risk that district judges will exercise the discretion conferred by the statute on a haphazard rather than a principled basis. In many cases, the judge can have no rational basis for determining whether or not the movant could ultimately succeed on the merits without first [ ordering a transcript.3 Unquestionably some judges routinely order a transcript in a case like this while others do not. Given the uncertainty of the standard adopted by the plurality,4 the indigent's right to protection against the risk that his appointed counsel was in fact ineffective depends on the] happenstance of what district judge has been assigned to his case. Such an important protection should not depend on such a fortuitous circumstance. In short, the administration of justice in the federal courts would be more evenhanded if the indigent's right to a transcript were not dependent either upon the advice he receives from counsel at the time when he may still file a direct appeal,5 or upon his later ability to persuade a trial that counsel's advice was actually unsound. The indigent is at least entitled to a transcript of sufficient completeness to permit a determination of frivolousness. Cf. Coppedge v. United States, 369 U.S. 438, 445-446, 82 S.Ct. 917, 920, 8 L.Ed.2d 21.6\n\n\n49\nSecond, in my judgment a ruling in respondent's favor would tend to improve the administration of justice in the federal system. If, as seems probable, such a ruling would make transcripts available almost automatically in \u00a7 2255 proceedings, it would make good sense for federal prosecutors to adopt the practice of routinely ordering the transcript at the conclusion of every criminal trial resulting in conviction. Such a practice would eliminate a serious cause of delay in the processing of criminal appeals.7 Even assuming an increase in monetary costs,8 we should take into account the costs associated with unnecessary delay in the appellate process and the saving in judges' time that would result from the elimination of the need to decide questions such as this. One of our Nation's scarcest resources is the time of our judges; if spending a few dollars9 for automatic disposition of preliminary issues will enable them to devote extra time to adjudicating disputes on the merits, the money will be well spent. See Coppedge, supra, 369 U.S., at 450-452, Id., at 458, 82 S.Ct., at 923, id., at 928 (STEWART, J., concurring); J. Frank, American Law: The Case for Radical Reform 85-110 (1969). More importantly, routine availability of transcripts would minimize the danger which is not so insignificant that it can be safely ignored that the rights of an indigent defendant may be lost because of the ineptitude of his appointed counsel.\n\n\n50\nI recognize that my view does not reflect a necessary reading of the statute as applied to respondent's \u00a7 2255 motion, but it certainly is permissible to rule as a matter of law that his allegations are sufficient to plead a nonfrivolous claim that cannot be resolved without a transcript.10 Such a ruling would have the added virtue of avoiding the constitutional issue discussed in Part III of the plurality's opinion. Cf. United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U.S. 394, 401, 36 S.Ct. 658, 659, 60 L.Ed. 1061. On balance, I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\n\n\n1\n Our Brother STEVENS would construe the pertinent part of \u00a7 753(f) to \"make transcripts available almost automatically in \u00a7 2255 proceedings . . .,\" Post, at 338. We think such a construction would do violence to the intent of Congress which clearly appears from the language of that section, Supra, at 320. Congress Did in that section make transcripts available automatically on Direct appeal, but in the same section limited their availability in \u00a7 2255 motions to cases where the trial judge certifies that the \u00a7 2255 suit is not frivolous and that the transcript is needed to decide the issue presented by the suit. Our Brother STEVENS advances what may well be very sound policy reasons for furnishing free transcripts as a matter of course to \u00a7 2255 plaintiffs, as well as to convicted defendants pursuing direct appeals. But it is plain from a reading of \u00a7 753(f) that these considerations have not yet commended themselves to Congress.\n\n\n2\n The difference is not as great as it might appear to be, however, because habeas corpus petitioners who wish to proceed In forma pauperis must still overcome a \"nonfrivolous\" barrier under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. E. g., Kitchens v. Alderman, 376 F.2d 262 (CA5 1967); Blair v. California, 340 F.2d 741 (CA9 1965).\n\n\n3\n The constitutional treatment of habeas corpus, of course, is not contained in the Due Process Clause, but in Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2, of the Constitution.\n\n\n4\n Since a \u00a7 2255 claim is usually presented to the trial judge he will likely have an independent recollection of counsel's performance which may well lead him to conclude that a movant's claim is nonfrivolous.\n\n\n5\n E. g., Ellis v.

Baker, 422 F.2d 1002 (CA10 1970).\n\n\n6\n This opinion and other aspects of this question were thoroughly discussed shortly after the 1965 amendment to \u00a7 753(f) in Blackmun, Allowance of In Forma Pauperis Appeals in \u00a7 2255 and Habeas Corpus Cases, 43 F.R.D. 343 (1967).\n\n\n1\n Respondent's other allegation is insufficiency of the evidence. Two of our decisions plainly indicate that this allegation suffices to require provision of a verbatim transcript. See Mayer v. City of Chicago, 404 U.S. 189, 92 S.Ct. 410, 30 L.Ed.2d 372 (1971); Draper v. Washington, 372 U.S. 487, 83 S.Ct. 774, 9 L.Ed.2d 899 (1963). Mayer also indicated that an allegation of prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct, 404 U.S., at 198, 92 S.Ct., at 416, also requires provision of a transcript. That claim, for purposes of substantiation on appeal or collateral review, is like respondent's first claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Mayer, 404 U.S., at 195, 92 S.Ct., at 415, held that where the grounds of appeal are insufficiency of the evidence and prosecutorial misconduct, the defendant need only \"make out a colorable need for a complete transcript\" in order to be entitled to it.\n\n\n2\n Indeed, in Burns v. Ohio, 360 U.S. 252, 79 S.Ct. 1164, 3 L.Ed.2d 1209 (1959), a filing fee for direct appeals was held invalid as applied to indigents, even though the indigent petitioner there had already received one appellate review of his conviction. As the Court stated:\n\"(T)he State argues that petitioner received one appellate review of his conviction in Ohio, while in Griffin, Illinois had left the defendant without any judicial review of his conviction. This is a distinction without a difference for, as Griffin holds, once the State chooses to establish appellate review in criminal cases, it may not foreclose indigents from access to any phase of that procedure because of their poverty.\" Id., at 257, 79 S.Ct., at 1168.\n\n\n1\n 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3006A(a), (c), (d)(6).\n\n\n2\n The provision for free transcripts in \u00a7 2255 cases was added in 1965 by Pub.L. 89-167, 79 Stat. 647, which followed verbatim a proposal of the Judicial Conference in 1961. Report of the Judicial Conference of the United States, Proceedings 100-101 (1961). The primary purpose of the amendment was to make transcripts as available to indigent federal prisoners on \u00a7 2255 motions as on habeas corpus. See H.R.Rep.No.133, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965); S.Rep.No.617, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1965, p. 2916; 111 Cong.Rec. 5000 (1905) (remarks of Rep. Celler); Id., at 20828-20829. The legislative sources do not discuss what standards should be applied in determining nonfrivolousness and need.\nSpecifically, the legislative history does not address the question whether federal prisoners are required to make a stronger showing of nonfrivolousness and need on \u00a7 2255 motions than on habeas corpus. Although \u00a7 753(f) expressly requires certification of nonfrivolousness and need only in \u00a7 2255 cases, it requires prior leave to proceed In forma pauperis in both habeas corpus and \u00a7 2255 proceedings. This requirement, in turn, imports the requirement of nonfrivolousness contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d). The legislative history contains no indication that the standard of nonfrivolousness for \u00a7 2255 cases was to be any stronger than that imposed by \u00a7 1915(d). See Blackmun, Allowance of In Forma Pauperis Appeals in \u00a7 2255 and Habeas Corpus Cases, 43 F.R.D. 343, 356-357 (1967). Indeed, \u00a7 1915 is nowhere mentioned. Nor does the requirement of need impose any additional burden upon \u00a7 2255 movants, since \u00a7\u00a7 753(f) and 1915(d) could not reasonably be interpreted to grant a right to a transcript to habeas corpus petitioners who assert nonfrivolous claims that can be resolved without a transcript.\n\n\n3\n Since our most gifted trial lawyers usually need daily copy to be sure of exactly what happened in the courtroom the preceding day, and since the passage of time is bound to cause any trial to be blended with many others in the judge's memory, it is almost inconceivable that the judge can determine whether a motion has arguable merit without the benefit of a transcript.\n\n\n4\n Would the plurality regard respondent's pleadings as sufficient if he had alleged that his lawyer failed to object to inadmissible evidence, failed to argue effectively to the jury, failed to advise him properly about his appeal rights, or failed to conduct an adequate cross-examination of key prosecution witnesses? Such allegations are just as easily made as the general claim of ineffectiveness of counsel and just as difficult to support by factual details without the assistance of a transcript. Rather than requiring the district judge to take the time to evaluate all the permutations of such allegations as these, is it not more sensible to make the record available promptly and automatically?\n\n\n5\n Indeed, the failure of respondent's attorney to file a notice of appeal itself supports his claim of denial of effective assistance of counsel. Because notice of appeal from a criminal conviction must be filed within the 10-day period specified in Fed.Rule App.Proc. 4(b), most defense counsel routinely file such notice in order to protect their clients' right to appeal and to obtain a transcript. Furthermore, in the present case, respondent represented in this Court, although not in the District Court, that he did not appeal from his conviction because he was advised by his lawyer that \" 'it would interfere with a motion to modify sentence.' \" Brief for Respondent 3.\n\n\n6\n Although I have described that right as \"almost\" the equivalent of the absolute right to a full transcript on direct appeal, the difference between the two is significant. Before Congress amended \u00a7 753(f) to provide for automatic availability of transcripts, Pub.L. 91-545, 84 Stat. 1412, the statute already authorized transcripts for appellants proceeding In forma pauperis, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f) (1964 ed., Supp. V), but, under Coppedge, 369 U.S., at 446, 82 S.Ct., at 921, it only entitled the appellant to a transcript sufficient to determine nonfrivolousness. The fact that Congress amended the statute to give the appellant the right to a complete transcript demonstrates (a) that Congress was aware of this difference, and (b) that recognition of a right in a \u00a7 2255 context which is only \"almost\" as valuable as the right on direct appeal is consistent with the intent of Congress.\n\n\n7\n As Judge Craven noted in Jones v. Superintendent, Virginia State Farm, 460 F.2d 150, 153 n. 4 (CA4 1972), rehearing denied, 465 F.2d 1091, cert. denied, 410 U.S. 944, 93 S.Ct. 1380, 35 L.Ed.2d 611 (1973): \"It has been noted time and again that the delay in deciding appeals is often attributable to delay in getting a transcript.\" Since the allowance of bail pending appeal is almost routine in the federal system (a routine, incidentally, which might well be restudied), defendants may postpone their incarceration by delaying their appeals as long as possible, and, thus, they have a practical motivation for not ordering transcripts any sooner than necessary.\n\n\n8\n Appeals are now filed in approximately 75% Of criminal cases in which a defendant is convicted after trial. The rate has increased steadily from approximately 46% In Fiscal Year 1966 to approximately 75% In Fiscal Year 1973, where it has remained. See Annual Reports of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Tables B1, D4 (1966-1969, 1971-1975) (compare total criminal appeals commenced with total convictions after trial). Since appeals are taken from such a high percentage of convictions after trial, since experience teaches us that the appeal rate is more apt to increase than decrease, and since an appreciable number of transcripts are no doubt prepared in \u00a7 2255 proceedings already, a rule requiring the automatic preparation of a transcript would have a minimal impact on the budget. Even if the total number of transcripts would increase significantly, it is doubtful that there would be a parallel increase in cost because there would surely be a substantial saving in substituting a routine practice for the present practice of ordering transcripts individually, often at a time when the court reporter is faced with an appellate deadline.\n\n\n9\n I use the words \"few dollars\" advisedly because the entire cost of subsidizing the defense of indigents, including the fees and expenses of appointed counsel, has amounted to between 5% And 9% Of the expenditures for the lower federal courts in recent years, which in turn have been less than 1\/10 of 1% Of the national budget.

DIGMON, Warden, et al.\nNo. 76-6799.\nJan. 16, 1978.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner sought habeas corpus relief in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama from his sentence following a judgment of conviction for rape in the Circuit Court of Calhoun County, Ala.  Among the allegations of constitutional error in his trial\u2014presented to the District Court in petitioner's traverse to the State's response to his petition petitioner claimed that the in-court identification of him by the prosecuting witness was the product of an out-of-court identification at an impermissibly suggestive photographic array and a later uncounseled lineup.  The District Court refused to entertain this claim on the ground, recited in its opinion, that \"this issue has never been presented to any state court.\"  No. 77-A-0029-E (mem. filed Feb. 11, 1977).  This conclusion was premised upon the absence of any reference to the contention in the reported opinion of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirming the conviction.  Smith v. State, 57 Ala.App. 164, 326 So.2d 692 (1975).  The District Court stated:  \"It is inconceivable to this Court that had Smith raised that issue [in the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals] that [that court] would not have written to it.\"  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied petitioner's pro se application for a certificate of probable cause and for leave to appeal in forma pauperis.  No. 77-8141 (Apr. 20, 1977).\n\n\n2\nIn his pro se petition for certiorari, petitioner asserted that \"[i]t is beyond doubt that State remedies have been exhausted.\"  Pet. for Cert. 3.  This Court direc ed the filing here of the briefs submitted to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals.  Petitioner's brief to that court reveals that petitioner, citing decisions of this Court,1 did indeed submit the constitutional contention that the prosecuting witness' in-court identification should have been excluded from evidence because that identification derived from an impermissibly suggestive pretrial photographic array and a later uncounseled lineup; moreover, the State Attorney General's brief devoted two of its seven pages to argument answering the contention.2\n\n\n3\nIt is too obvious to merit extended discussion that whether the exhaustion requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) has been satisfied cannot turn upon whether a state appellate court chooses to ignore in its opinion a federal constitutional claim squarely raised in petitioner's brief in the state court, and, indeed, in this case, vigorously opposed in the State's brief.  It is equally obvious that a district court commits plain error in assuming that a habeas petitioner must have failed to raise in the state courts a meritorious claim that he is incarcerated in violation of the Constitution if the state appellate court's opinion contains no reference to the claim.\n\n\n4\nThe motion to proceed in forma pauperis, and the petition for certiorari are granted.  The order of the Court of Appeals and the judgment of the District Court are reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n5\nSo ordered.\n\n\n6\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice BLACKMUN join, concurring in the result.\n\n\n7\nI am not at all certain that the petitioner properly raised before the Court of Appeals the error upon which we today reverse and remand.  While petitioner filed a pro se application for probable cause and for leave to appeal in forma pauperis with the Court of Appeals, as far as the record shows, he did not allege any particular error on the part of the District Court.  Again as far as the record shows, petitioner failed to bring the District Court's error to anyone's attention until his petition for certiorari in this Court.  The lower courts are better equipped and suited to resolve factual errors of the nature raised here and such errors should therefore be raised before them in the first instance.  Indeed, we would seem limited to only those questions explicitly presented to the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n8\nHowever, because it is now clear that the District Court erred in concluding that the petitioner had not raised the in-court identification issue before the state courts, I defer to the Court's necessarily implied conclusion that the question was presented to the Court of Appeals and concur in the result.\n\n\n\n1\n Simmons v.

State of WASHINGTON et al., Petitioners,  v.  UNITED STATES et al.  PUGET SOUND GILLNETTERS ASSOCIATION et al., Petitioners,  v.  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR the WESTERN DISTRICT  OF WASHINGTON (United States et al., Real Parties  in Interest).\nNos. 77-983, 78-119 and 78-139.\nArgued Feb. 28, 1979.\nDecided July 2, 1979.\n\n\nSyllabus\n\nIn 1854 and 1855, the United States entered into a series of treaties with certain Indian tribes whereby the Indians relinquished their interest in certain lands in what is now the State of Washington in exchange for monetary payments, certain relatively small parcels of land reserved for their exclusive use, and other guarantees, including protection of their \"right of taking fish at usual and accustomed grounds and stations  . . . in common with all citizens of the Territory.\"  The principal question in this extensive litigation concerns the character of the treaty right to take fish.  In 1970, the United States, on its own behalf and as trustee for seven Indian tribes, brought suit against the State of Washington in Federal District Court, seeking an interpretation of the treaties and an injunction requiring the State to protect the Indians' share of runs of anadromous fish. At various stages of the proceedings, additional tribes, the State Departments of Fisheries and Game, and a commercial fishing group were joined as parties.  The District Court held that under the treaties, the Indians are currently entitled to a 45% to 50% share of the harvestable fish passing through their recognized tribal fishing grounds in the case area, to be calculated on a river-by-river, run-by-run basis, subject to certain adjustments. With a slight modification of one of the adjustments, the Court of Appeals affirmed, and this Court denied certiorari.  Pursuant to the District Court's injunction, the Department of Fisheries promulgated regulations protecting the Indians' treaty rights, but the State Supreme Court, in two cases (consolidated here in No. 77-983), ruled that the Fisheries Department could not comply with the federal injunction, holding, inter alia, that, as a matter of federal law, the treaties did not give the Indians a right to a share of the fish runs. The District Court then entered a series of orders enabling it directly to supervise those aspects of the State's fisheries necessary to the preservation of treaty fishing rights.  The District Court's power to take such direct action and, in doing so, to enjoin persons who were not parties to the proceedings was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.  That court, in a separate opinion, also held that regulations of the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission (IPSFC) posed no impediment to the District Court's interpretation of the treaty language and to its enforcement of that interpretation.\nHeld :\n1. The language of the treaties securing a \"right of taking fish  . . .  in common with all citizens of the Territory\" was not intended merely to guarantee the Indians access to usual and accustomed fishing sites and an \"equal opportunity\" for individual Indians, along with non-Indians, to try to catch fish, but instead secures to the Indian tribes a right to harvest a share of each run of anadromous fish that passes through tribal fishing areas. This conclusion is mandated by a fair appraisal of the purpose of the treaty negotiations, the language of the treaties, and, particularly, this Court's prior decisions construing the treaties.  United States v. Winans, 198 U.S. 371, 25 S.Ct. 662, 49 L.Ed. 1089;  Puyallup Tribe v. Washington Game Dept., 391 U.S. 392, 88 S.Ct. 1725, 20 L.Ed.2d 689 (Puyallup I );  Washington Game Dept. v. Puyallup Tribe, 414 U.S. 44, 94 S.Ct. 330, 38 L.Ed.2d 254 (Puyallup II );  Puyallup Tribe v. Washington Game Dept., 433 U.S. 165, 97 S.Ct. 2616, 53 L.Ed.2d 667 (Puyallup III ).  Pp. 674-685.\n2. An equitable measure of the common right to take fish should initially divide the harvestable portion of each run that passes through a \"usual and accustomed\" place into approximately equal treaty and nontreaty shares, and should then reduce the treaty share if tribal needs may be satisfied by a lesser amount. Cf. Puyallup III, supra.  Although the District Court's exercise of its discretion, as slightly modified by the Court of Appeals, is in most respects unobjectionable, the District Court erred in excluding fish taken by the Indians on their reservations from their share of the runs, and in excluding fish caught for the Indians' ceremonial and subsistence needs.  Pp. 685-689.\n3. The Convention of May 26, 1930, whereby Canada and the United States agreed that the catch of Fraser River salmon should be equally divided between Canadian and American fishermen, subject to regulations proposed by the IPSFC for approval by both countries, does not pre-empt the Indians' fishing rights under the treaties with respect to Fraser River salmon runs passing through certain \"usual and accustomed\" places of treaty tribes.  Pp. 689-692.\n4. Any state-law prohibition against compliance with the District Court's decree cannot survive the command of the Supremacy Clause, and the State Game and Fisheries Departments, as parties to this litigation, may be ordered to prepare a set of rules that will implement the court's interpretation of the parties' rights even if state law withholds from them the power to do so.  Cf. Puyallup III, supra.  Whether or not the Game and Fisheries Departments may be ordered actually to promulgate regulations having effect as a matter of state law, the District Court may assume direct supervision of the fisheries if state recalcitrance or state-law barriers should be continued.  If the spirit of cooperation motivating the State Attorney General's representation to this Court that definitive resolution of the basic federal question of construction of the treaties will allow state compliance with federal-court orders is not confirmed by the conduct of state officials, the District Court has the power to undertake the necessary remedial steps and to enlist the aid of appropriate federal law enforcement agents in carrying out those steps.

In addition, certain relatively small parcels of land were reserved for their exclusive use, and they were afforded other guarantees, including protection of their \"right of taking fish, at all usual and accustomed grounds and stations  . . .  in common with all citizens of the Territory.\"  10 Stat. 1133.\n\n\n7\nThe principal question presented by this litigation concerns the character of that treaty right to take fish.  Various other issues are presented, but their disposition depends on the answer to the principal question.  Before answering any of these questions, or even stating the issues with more precision, we shall briefly describe the anadromous fisheries of the Pacific Northwest, the treaty negotiations, and the principal components of the litigation complex that led us to grant these three related petitions for certiorari.\n\n\n8\n* Anadromous fish hatch in fresh water, migrate to the ocean where they are reared and reach mature size, and eventually complete their life cycle by returning to the fresh-water place of their origin to spawn.  Different species have different life cycles, some spending several years and traveling great distances in the ocean before returning to spawn and some even returning to spawn on more than one occasion before dying. 384 F.Supp. 312, 384, 405.  See Comment, State Power and the Indian Treaty Right to Fish, 59 Calif.L.Rev. 485, 501, and n. 99 (1971).  The regular habits of these fish make their \"runs\" predictable;  this predictability in turn makes it possible for both fishermen and regulators to forecast and to control the number of fish that will be caught or \"harvested.\"  Indeed, as the terminology associated with it suggests, the management of anadromous fisheries is in many ways more akin to the cultivation of \"crops\"\u2014with its relatively high degree of predictability and productive stability, subject mainly to sudden changes in climatic patterns\u2014than is the management of most other commercial and sport fisheries.  384 F.Supp., at 351, 384.\n\n\n9\nRegulation of the anadromous fisheries of the Northwest is nonetheless complicated by the different habits of the various species of salmon and trout involved, by the variety of methods of taking the fish, and by the fact that a run of fish may pass through a series of different jurisdictions.3  Another complexity arises from the fact that the State of Washington has attempted to reserve one species, steelhead trout, for sport fishing and therefore conferred regulatory jurisdiction over that species upon its Department of Game, whereas the various species of salmon are primarily harvested by commercial fishermen and are managed by the State's Department of Fisheries.  Id., at 383-385, 389-399. Moreover, adequate regulation not only must take into account the potentially conflicting interests of sport and commercial fishermen, as well as those of Indian and nontreaty fishermen, but also must recognize that the fish runs may be harmed by harvesting either too many or too few of the fish returning to spawn.  Id., at 384, 390.\n\n\n10\nThe anadromous fish constitute a natural resource of great economic value to the State of Washington.  Millions of salmon, with an average weight of from 4 or 5 to about 20 pounds, depending on the species, are harvested each year.  Over 6,600 nontreaty fishermen and about 800 Indians make their livelihood by commercial fishing;  moreover, some 280,000 individuals are licensed to engage in sport fishing in the State.4 Id., at 387. See id., at 399.\n\nII\n\n11\nOne hundred and twenty-five years ago when the relevant treaties were signed, anadromous fish were even more important to most of the population of western Washington than they are today. At that time, about three-fourths of the approximately 10,000 inhabitants of the area were Indians.  Although in some respects the cultures of the different tribes varied\u2014some bands of Indians, for example, had little or no tribal organization5 while others, such as the Makah and the Yakima, were highly organized\u2014all of them shared a vital and unifying dependence on anadromous fish. Id., at 350.  See Puyallup Tribe v. Washington Game Dept., 433 U.S. 165, 179, 97 S.Ct. 2616, 2624, 53 L.Ed.2d 667 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting in part).\n\n\n12\nReligious rites were intended to insure the continual return of the salmon and the trout;  the seasonal and geographic variations in the runs of the different species determined the movements of the largely nomadic tribes.  384 F.Supp., at 343, 351, 382;  459 F.Supp. 1020, 1079;  520 F.2d 676, 682.  Fish constituted a major part of the Indian diet, was used for commercial purposes,6 and indeed was traded in substantial volume.7  The Indians developed food-preservation techniques that enabled them to store fish throughout the year and to transport it over great distances.  384 F.Supp., at 351.8  They used a wide variety of methods to catch fish, including the precursors of all modern netting techniques.  Id., at 351, 352, 362, 368, 380.  Their usual and accustomed fishing places were numerous and were scattered throughout the area, and included marine as well as fresh-water areas.  Id., at 353, 360, 368-369.\n\n\n13\nAll of the treaties were negotiated by Isaac Stevens, the first Governor and first Superintendent of Indian Affairs of the Washington Territory, and a small group of advisers. Contemporaneous documents make it clear that these people recognized the vital importance of the fisheries to the Indians and wanted to protect them from the risk that non-Indian settlers might seek to monopolize their fisheries.  Id., at 355, 363.9 There is no evidence of the precise understanding the Indians had of any of the specific English terms and phrases in the treaty.10 Id., at 356.  It is perfectly clear, however, that the Indians were vitally interested in protecting their right to take fish at usual and accustomed places, whether on or off the reservations, id., at 355, and that they were invited by the white negotiators to rely and in fact did rely heavily on the good faith of the United States to protect that right.11\n\n\n14\nReferring to the negotiations with the Yakima Nation, by far the largest of the Indian tribes, the District Court found:\n\n\n15\n\"At the treaty council the United States negotiators      promised, and the Indians understood, that the Yakimas would      forever be able to continue the same off-reservation food      gathering and fishing practices as to time, place, method,      species and extent as they had or were exercising.  The      Yakimas relied on these promises and they formed a material      and basic part of the treaty and of the Indians' understanding of the meaning of the treaty.\"  Id., at 381      (record citations omitted).\n\n\n16\nSee also id., at 363 (similar finding regarding negotiations with the Makah Tribe).\n\n\n17\nThe Indians understood that non-Indians would also have the right to fish at their off-reservation fishing sites.  But this was not understood as a significant limitation on their right to take fish.12  Because of the great abundance of fish and the limited population of the area, it simply was not contemplated that either party would interfere with the other's fishing rights. The parties accordingly did not see the need and did not intend to regulate the taking of fish by either Indians or non-Indians, nor was future regulation foreseen.  Id., at 334, 355, 357.\n\n\n18\nIndeed, for several decades after the treaties were signed, Indians continued to harvest most of the fish taken from the waters of Washington, and they moved freely about the Territory and later the State in search of that resource.   Id., at 334. The size of the fishery resource continued to obviate the need during the period to regulate the taking of fish by either Indians or non-Indians.  Id., at 352.  Not until major economic developments in canning and processing occurred in the last few years of the 19th century did a significant non-Indian fishery develop.13  It was as a consequence of these developments, rather than of the treaty, that non-Indians began to dominate the fisheries and eventually to exclude most Indians from participating in it\u2014a trend that was encouraged by the onset of often discriminatory state regulation in the early decades of the 20th century.   Id., at 358, 394, 404, 407;  459 F.Supp., at 1032.14\n\n\n19\nIn sum, it is fair to conclude that when the treaties were negotiated, neither party realized or intended that their agreement would determine whether, and if so how, a resource that had always been thought inexhaustible would be allocated between the native Indians and the incoming settlers when it later became scarce.\n\nIII\n\n20\nUnfortunately, that resource has now become scarce, and the meaning of the Indians' treaty right to take fish has accordingly become critical.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court of the State of Washington have issued conflicting decisions on its meaning.  In addition, their holdings raise important ancillary questions that will appear from a brief review of this extensive litigation.\n\n\n21\nThe federal litigation was commenced in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington in 1970. The United States, on its own behalf and as trustee for seven Indian tribes, brought suit against the State of Washington seeking an interpretation of the treaties and an injunction requiring the State to protect the Indians' share of the anadromous fish runs.  Additional Indian tribes, the State's Fisheries and Game Departments, and one commercial fishing group, were joined as parties at various stages of the proceedings, while various other agencies and groups, including all of the commercial fishing associations that are parties here, participated as amici curiae.  384 F.Supp., at 327, 328, and n. 4;  459 F.Supp., at 1028.\n\n\n22\nDuring the extensive pretrial proceedings, four different interpretations of the critical treaty language were advanced.  Of those, three proceeded from the assumption that the language required some allocation to the Indians of a share of the runs of fish passing through their traditional fishing areas each year. The tribes themselves contended that the treaties had reserved a pre-existing right to as many fish as their commercial and subsistence needs dictated.  The United States argued that the Indians were entitled either to a 50% share of the \"harvestable\" fish that originated in and returned to the \"case area\" and passed through their fishing places,15 or to their needs, whichever was less.  The Department of Fisheries agreed that the Indians were entitled to \"a fair and equitable share\" stated in terms of a percentage of the harvestable salmon in the area;  ultimately it proposed a share of \"one-third.\"\n\n\n23\nOnly the Game Department thought the treaties provided no assurance to the Indians that they could take some portion of each run of fish.  That agency instead argued that the treaties gave the Indians no fishing rights not enjoyed by non-treaty fishermen except the two rights previously recognized by decisions of this Court\u2014the right of access over private lands to their usual and accustomed fishing grounds, see Seufert Bros. Co. v. United States, 249 U.S. 194, 39 S.Ct. 203, 63 L.Ed. 555;  United States v. Winans, 198 U.S. 371, 25 S.Ct. 662, 49 L.Ed. 1089, and an exemption from the payment of license fees.  See Tulee v. Washington, 315 U.S. 681, 62 S.Ct. 862, 86 L.Ed. 1115.\n\n\n24\nThe District Court agreed with the parties who advocated an allocation to the Indians, and it essentially agreed with the United States as to what that allocation should be.  It held that the Indians were then entitled to a 45% to 50% share of the harvestable fish that will at some point pass through recognized tribal fishing grounds in the case area.16  The share was to be calculated on a river-by-river, run-by-run basis, subject to certain adjustments.  Fish caught by Indians for ceremonial and subsistence purposes as well as fish caught within a reservation were excluded from the calculation of the tribes' share.17  In addition, in order to compensate for fish caught outside of the case area, i. e., beyond the State's jurisdiction, the court made an \"equitable adjustment\" to increase the allocation to the Indians.  The court left it to the individual tribes involved to agree among themselves on how best to divide the Indian share of runs that pass through the usual and accustomed grounds of more than one tribe, and it postponed until a later date the proper accounting for hatchery-bred fish.  384 F.Supp., at 416-417;  459 F.Supp., at 1129.  With a slight modification,18 the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, 520 F.2d 676, and we denied certiorari, 423 U.S. 1086, 96 S.Ct. 877, 47 L.Ed.2d 97.19\n\n\n25\nThe injunction entered by the District Court required the Department of Fisheries (Fisheries) to adopt regulations protecting the Indians' treaty rights.  384 F.Supp., at 416-417. After the new regulations were promulgated, however, they were immediately challenged by private citizens in suits commenced in the Washington state courts.  The State Supreme Court, in two cases that are here in consolidated form in No. 77-983, ultimately held that Fisheries could not comply with the federal injunction. Puget Sound Gillnetters Assn. v. Moos, 88 Wash.2d 677, 565 P. 1151 (1977);  Fishing Vessel Assn. v. Tollefson, 89 Wash.2d 276, 571 P.2d 1373 (1977).\n\n\n26\nAs a matter of federal law, the state court first accepted the Game Department's and rejected the District Court's interpretation of the treaties and held that it did not give the Indians a right to a share of the fish runs, and second concluded that recognizing special rights for the Indians would violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The opinions might also be read to hold, as a matter of state law, that Fisheries had no authority to issue the regulations because they had a purpose other than conservation of the resource.  In this Court, however, the Attorney General of the State disclaims the adequacy and independence of the state-law ground and argues that the state-law authority of Fisheries is dependent on the answers to the two federal-law questions discussed above.  Brief for State of Washington 99.  See n. 34, infra.  We defer to that interpretation, subject, of course, to later clarification by the State Supreme Court.  Because we are also satisfied that the constitutional holding is without merit,20 our review of the state court's judgment will be limited to the treaty issue.\n\n\n27\nWhen Fisheries was ordered by the state courts to abandon its attempt to promulgate and enforce regulations in compliance with the federal court's decree\u2014and when the Game Department simply refused to comply\u2014the District Court entered a series of orders enabling it, with the aid of the United States Attorney for the Western District of Washington and various federal law enforcement agencies, directly to supervise those aspects of the State's fisheries necessary to the preservation of treaty fishing rights. 459 F.Supp. 1020.  The District Court's power to take such direct action and, in doing so, to enjoin persons who were not parties to the proceeding was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  573 F.2d 1123.  That court, in a separate opinion, 573 F.2d 1118, also held that regulations of the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission posed no impediment to the District Court's interpretation of the treaty language and to its enforcement of that interpretation. Subsequently, the District Court entered an enforcement order regarding the salmon fisheries for the 1978 and subsequent seasons, which, prior to our issuance of a writ of certiorari to review the case, was pending on appeal in the Court of Appeals. App. 486-490.\n\n\n28\nBecause of the widespread defiance of the District Court's orders, this litigation has assumed unusual significance.  We granted certiorari in the state and federal cases to interpret this important treaty provision and thereby to resolve the conflict between the state and federal courts regarding what, if any, right the Indians have to a share of the fish, to address the implications of international regulation of the fisheries in the area, and to remove any doubts about the federal court's power to enforce its orders.  439 U.S. 909, 99 S.Ct. 277, 58 L.Ed.2d 255.\n\nIV\n\n29\nThe treaties secure a \"right of taking fish.\"  The pertinent articles provide:\n\n\n30\n\"The right of taking fish, at all usual and accustomed      grounds and stations, is further secured to said Indians, in      common with all citizens of the Territory, and of erecting      temporary houses for the purpose of curing, together with the      privilege of hunting, gathering roots and berries, and      pasturing their horses on open and unclaimed lands:      Provided, however, That they shall not take shell fish from      any beds staked or cultivated by citizens.\"21\n\n\n31\nAt the time the treaties were executed there was a great abundance of fish and a relative scarcity of people.  No one had any doubt about the Indians' capacity to take as many fish as they might need.  Their right to take fish could therefore be adequately protected by guaranteeing them access to usual and accustomed fishing sites which could be\u2014and which for decades after the treaties were signed were\u2014comfortably shared with the incoming settlers.\n\n\n32\nBecause the sparse contemporaneous written materials refer primarily to assuring access to fishing sites \"in common with all citizens of the Territory,\" the State of Washington and the commercial fishing associations, having all adopted the Game Department's original position, argue that it was merely access that the negotiators guaranteed.  It is equally plausible to conclude, however, that the specific provision for access was intended to secure a greater right\u2014a right to harvest a share of the runs of anadromous fish that at the time the treaties were signed were so plentiful that no one could question the Indians' capacity to take whatever quantity they needed.  Indeed, a fair appraisal of the purpose of the treaty negotiations, the language of the treaties, and this Court's prior construction of the treaties, mandates that conclusion.\n\n\n33\nA treaty, including one between the United States and an Indian tribe, is essentially a contract between two sovereign nations.  E. g., Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U.S. 553, 23 S.Ct. 216, 47 L.Ed. 299.  When the signatory nations have not been at war and neither is the vanquished, it is reasonable to assume that they negotiated as equals at arm's length.  There is no reason to doubt that this assumption applies to the treaties at issue here. See 520 F.2d, at 684.\n\n\n34\nAccordingly, it is the intention of the parties, and not solely that of the superior side, that must control any attempt to interpret the treaties.  When Indians are involved, this Court has long given special meaning to this rule.  It has held that the United States, as the party with the presumptively su perior negotiating skills and superior knowledge of the language in which the treaty is recorded, has a responsibility to avoid taking advantage of the other side.  \"[T]he treaty must therefore be construed, not according to the technical meaning of its words to learned lawyers, but in the sense in which they would naturally be understood by the Indians.\"  Jones v. Meehan, 175 U.S. 1, 11, 20 S.Ct. 1, 5, 44 L.Ed. 49.  This rule, in fact, has thrice been explicitly relied on by the Court in broadly interpreting these very treaties in the Indians' favor.  Tulee v. Washington, 315 U.S. 681, 62 S.Ct. 862, 86 L.Ed. 1115;  Seufert Bros. Co. v. United States, 249 U.S. 194, 39 S.Ct. 203, 63 L.Ed. 555;  United States v. Winans, 198 U.S. 371, 25 S.Ct. 662, 49 L.Ed. 1089.  See also Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation, 439 U.S. 463, 484, 99 S.Ct. 740, 753, 58 L.Ed.2d 740.\n\n\n35\nGovernor Stevens and his associates were well aware of the \"sense\" in which the Indians were likely to view assurances regarding their fishing rights.  During the negotiations, the vital importance of the fish to the Indians was repeatedly emphasized by both sides, and the Governor's promises that the treaties would protect that source of food and commerce were crucial in obtaining the Indians' assent.  See supra, at 666-668. It is absolutely clear, as Governor Stevens himself said, that neither he nor the Indians intended that the latter \"should be excluded from their ancient fisheries,\" see n. 9, supra, and it is accordingly inconceivable that either party deliberately agreed to authorize future settlers to crowd the Indians out of any meaningful use of their accustomed places to fish.  That each individual Indian would share an \"equal opportunity\" with thousands of newly arrived individual settlers is totally foreign to the spirit of the negotiations.22  Such a \"right,\" along with the $207,500 paid the Indians, would hardly have been sufficient to compensate them for the millions of acres they ceded to the Territory.\n\n\n36\nIt is true that the words \"in common with\" may be read either as nothing more than a guarantee that individual Indians would have the same right as individual non-Indians or as securing an interest in the fish runs themselves.  If we were to construe these words by reference to 19th-century property concepts, we might accept the former interpretation, although even \"learned lawyers\" of the day would probably have offered differing interpretations of the three words.23 But we think greater importance should be given to the Indians' likely understanding of the other words in the treaties and especially the reference to the \"right of taking fish\"\u2014a right that had no special meaning at common law but that must have had obvious significance to the tribes relinquishing a portion of their pre-existing rights to the United States in return for this promise.  This language is particularly meaningful in the context of anadromous fisheries\u2014which were not the focus of the common law because of the relative predictability of the \"harvest.\"  In this context, it makes sense to say that a party has a right to \"take\" rather than merely the \"opportunity\" to try to catch\u2014some of the large quantities of fish that will almost certainly be available at a given place at a given time.\n\n\n37\nThis interpretation is confirmed by additional language in the treaties.  The fishing clause speaks of \"securing\" certain fishing rights, a term the Court has previously interpreted as synonymous with \"reserving\" rights previously exercised.  Winans, 198 U.S., at 381, 25 S.Ct., at 664.  See also New York ex rel. Kennedy v. Becker, 241 U.S. 556, 563-564, 36 S.Ct. 705, 707-708, 60 L.Ed. 1166.  Because the Indians had always exercised the right to meet their subsistence and commercial needs by taking fish from treaty area waters, they would be unlikely to perceive a \"reservation\" of that right as merely the chance, shared with millions of other citizens, occasionally to dip their nets into the territorial waters.  Moreover, the phrasing of the clause quite clearly avoids placing each individual Indian on an equal footing with each individual citizen of the State.  The referent of the \"said Indians\" who are to share the right of taking fish with \"all citizens of the Territory\" is not the individual Indians but the various signatory \"tribes and bands of Indians\" listed in the opening article of each treaty. Because it was the tribes that were given a right in common with non-Indian citizens, it is especially likely that a class right to a share of fish, rather than a personal right to attempt to land fish, was intended.\n\n\n38\nIn our view, the purpose and language of the treaties are unambiguous;  they secure the Indians' right to take a share of each run of fish that passes through tribal fishing areas.  But our prior decisions provide an even more persuasive reason why this interpretation is not open to question.  For notwithstanding the bitterness that this litigation has engendered, the principal issue involved is virtually a \"matter decided\" by our previous holdings.\n\n\n39\nThe Court has interpreted the fishing clause in these treaties on six prior occasions.  In all of these cases the Court placed a relatively broad gloss on the Indians' fishing rights and more or less explicitly\u2014rejected the State's \"equal opportunity\" approach;  in the earliest and the three most recent cases, moreover, we adopted essentially the interpretation that the United States is reiterating here.\n\n\n40\nIn United States v. Winans, supra, the respondent, having acquired title to property on the Columbia River and having obtained a license to use a \"fish wheel\"\u2014a device capable of catching salmon by the ton and totally destroying a run of fish asserted the right to exclude the Yakimas from one of their \"usual and accustomed\" places.  The Circuit Court for the District of Washington sustained respondent, but this Court reversed.  The Court initially rejected an argument that is analogous to the \"equal opportunity\" claim now made by the State:\n\n\n41\n\"[I]t was decided [below] that the Indians acquired no      rights but what any inhabitant of the Territory or State      would have.  Indeed, acquired no rights but such as they      would have without the treaty.  This is certainly an impotent      outcome to negotiations and a convention, which seemed to      promise more and give the word of the Nation for more.  . . .      How the treaty in question was understood may be gathered      from the circumstances.\n\n\n42\n\"The right to resort to the fishing places in      controversy was a part of larger rights possessed by the      Indians, upon the exercise of which there was not a shadow of      impediment, and which were not much less necessary to the      existence of the Indians than the atmosphere they breathed.      New conditions came into existence, to which those rights had      to be accommodated.  Only a limitation of them, however, was      necessary and intended, not a taking away.  In other words,      the treaty was not a grant of rights to the Indians, but a      grant of rights from them\u2014a reservation of those not granted.      And the form of the instrument and its language was adapted      to that purpose.  . . .  There was an exclusive right to      fishing reserved within certain boundaries.  There was a      right outside of those boundaries reserved 'in common with      citizens of the Territory.'  As a mere right, it was not      exclusive in the Indians.  Citizens might share it, but the      Indians were secured in its enjoyment by a special provision      of means for its exercise.  They were given 'the right of      taking fish at all usual and accustomed places,' and the      right 'of erecting temporary buildings for curing them.'  The      contingency of the future ownership of the lands, therefore,      was foreseen and provided for;  in other words, the Indians were given a right in the land\u2014the right      of crossing it to the river\u2014the right to occupy it to the      extent and for the purpose mentioned.  No other conclusion      would give effect to the treaty.\"  198 U.S., at 380-381, 25      S.Ct., at 664.\n\n\n43\nSee also Seufert Bros., 249 U.S., at 198, 39 S.Ct., at 205, and Tulee, 315 U.S., at 684, 62 S.Ct., at 864, both of which repeated this analysis, in holding that treaty Indians had rights, \"beyond those which other citizens may enjoy,\" to fish without paying license fees in ceded areas and even in accustomed fishing places lying outside of the lands ceded by the Indians.  See n. 22, supra.\n\n\n44\nBut even more significant than the language in Winans is its actual disposition.  The Court not only upheld the Indians' right of access to respondent's private property but also ordered the Circuit Court on remand to devise some \"adjustment and accommodation\" that would protect them from total exclusion from the fishery.  198 U.S., at 384, 25 S.Ct., at 665.  Although the accommodation it suggested by reference to the Solicitor General's brief in the case is subject to interpretation, it clearly included removal of enough of the fishing wheels to enable some fish to escape and be available to Indian fishermen upstream. Brief for United States, O.T. 1904, No. 180, pp. 54-56.  In short, it assured the Indians a share of the fish.\n\n\n45\nIn the more recent litigation over this treaty language between the Puyallup Tribe and the Washington Department of Game,24 the Court in the context of a dispute over rights to the run of steelhead trout on the Puyallup River reaffirmed both of the holdings that may be drawn from Winans \u2014the treaty guarantees the Indians more than simply the \"equal opportunity\" along with all of the citizens of the State to catch fish, and it in fact assures them some portion of each relevant run.  But the three Puyallup cases are even more explicit;  they clearly establish the principle that neither party to the treaties may rely on the State's regulatory powers or on property law concepts to defeat the other's right to a \"fairly apportioned\" share of each covered run of harvestable anadromous fish.\n\n\n46\nIn Puyallup I, the Court sustained the State's power to impose nondiscriminatory regulations on treaty fishermen so long as they were \"necessary\" for the conservation of the various species.  In so holding, the Court again explicitly rejected the equal-opportunity theory.  Although nontreaty fishermen might be subjected to any reasonable state fishing regulation serving any legitimate purpose, treaty fishermen are immune from all regulation save that required for conservation.25\n\n\n47\nWhen the Department of Game sought to impose a total ban on commercial net fishing for steelhead, the Court held in Puyallup II that such regulation was not a \"reasonable and necessary conservation measure\" and would deny the Indians their \"fairly apportioned\" share of the Puyallup River run.  414 U.S., 44-45, 48, 94 S.Ct., 330, 332, 333, 38 L.Ed.2d 254. Although under the challenged regulation every individual fisherman would have had an equal opportunity to use a hook and line to land the steelhead, most of the fish would obviously have been caught by the 145,000 nontreaty licensees rather than by the handful of treaty fishermen.  This Court vindicated the Indians' treaty right to \"take fish\" by invalidating the ban on Indian net fishing and remanding the case with instructions to the state courts to determine the portion of harvestable steelhead that should be allocated to net fishing by members of the tribe.  Id., at 48-49, 94 S.Ct., at 333.  Even if Winans had not already done so, this unanimous holding foreclosed the basic argument that the State is now advancing.\n\n\n48\nOn remand, the Washington state courts held that 45% of the steelhead run was allocable to commercial net fishing by the Indians.  We shall later discuss how that specific percentage was determined;  what is material for present purposes is the recognition, upheld by this Court in Puyallup III, that the treaty secured the Tribe's right to a substantial portion of the run, and not merely a right to compete with nontreaty fishermen on an individual basis.26\n\n\n49\nPuyallup III also made it clear that the Indians could not rely on their treaty right to exclude others from access to certain fishing sites to deprive other citizens of the State of a \"fair apportionment\" of the runs.  For although it is clear that the Tribe may exclude non-Indians from access to fishing within the reservation, we unequivocally rejected the Tribe's claim to an untrammeled right to take as many of the steelhead running through its reservation as it chose.  In support of our holding that the State has regulatory jurisdiction over on-reservation fishing, we reiterated Mr. Justice Douglas' statement for the Court in Puyallup II that the \"Treaty does not give the Indians a federal right to pursue the last living steelhead until it enters their nets.\"  414 U.S., at 49, 94 S.Ct., at 334.  It is in this sense that treaty and nontreaty fishermen hold \"equal\" rights.  For neither party may deprive the other of a \"fair share\" of the runs.\n\n\n50\nNot only all six of our cases interpreting the relevant treaty language but all federal courts that have interpreted the treaties in recent times have reached the foregoing conclusions, see Sohappy v. Smith, 302 F.Supp. 899, 908, 911 (Ore.1969) (citing cases), as did the Washington Supreme Court itself prior to the present litigation.  State v. Satiacum, 50 Wash.2d 513, 523-524, 314 P.2d 400, 406 (1957).  A like interpretation, moreover, has been followed by the Court with respect to hunting rights explicitly secured by treaty to Indians \" 'in common with all other persons,' \" Antoine v. Washington, 420 U.S. 194, 205-206, 95 S.Ct. 944, 951, 43 L.Ed.2d 129, and to water rights that were merely implicitly secured to the Indians by treaties reserving land\u2014treaties that the Court enforced by ordering an apportionment to the Indians of enough water to meet their subsistence and cultivation needs.  Arizona v. California, 373 U.S. 546, 598-601, 83 S.Ct. 1468, 1496-1498, 10 L.Ed.2d 542, followingUnited States v. Powers, 305 U.S. 527, 528-533, 59 S.Ct. 344, 345-346, 83 L.Ed. 330;  Winters v. United States, 207 U.S. 564, 576, 28 S.Ct. 207, 211, 52 L.Ed. 340.\n\n\n51\nThe purport of our cases is clear.  Nontreaty fishermen may not rely on property law concepts, devices such as the fish wheel, license fees, or general regulations to deprive the Indians of a fair share of the relevant runs of anadromous fish in the case area.  Nor may treaty fishermen rely on their exclusive right of access to the reservations to destroy the rights of other \"citizens of the Territory.\"  Both sides have a right, secured by treaty, to take a fair share of the available fish.  That, we think, is what the parties to the treaty intended when they secured to the Indians the right of taking fish in common with other citizens.\n\nV\n\n52\nWe also agree with the Government that an equitable measure of the common right should initially divide the harvestable portion of each run that passes through a \"usual and accustomed\" place into approximately equal treaty and nontreaty shares, and should then reduce the treaty share if tribal needs may be satisfied by a lesser amount.  Although this method of dividing the resource, unlike the right to some division, is not mandated by our prior cases, it is consistent with the 45%-55% division arrived at by the Washington state courts, and affirmed by this Court, in Puyallup III with respect to the steelhead run on the Puyallup River.  The trial court in the Puyallup litigation reached those figures essentially by starting with a 50% allocation based on the Indians' reliance on the fish for their livelihoods and then adjusting slightly downward due to other relevant factors.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in Puyallup III, O.T. 1976, No. 76-423, pp. C-56 to C-57.  The District Court took a similar tack in this case, i. e., by starting with a 50-50 division and adjusting slightly downward on the Indians' side when it became clear that they did not need a full 50%.  384 F.Supp., at 402, 416-417;  459 F.Supp., at 1101;  573 F.2d, at 1129.\n\n\n53\nThe division arrived at by the District Court is also consistent with our earlier decisions concerning Indian treaty rights to scarce natural resources.  In those cases, after determining that at the time of the treaties the resource involved was necessary to the Indians' welfare, the Court typically ordered a trial judge or special master, in his discretion, to devise some apportionment that assured that the Indians' reasonable livelihood needs would be met.   Arizona v. California, supra, 373 U.S., at 600, 83 S.Ct., at 1497; Winters, supra.  See Winans, 198 U.S., at 384, 25 S.Ct., at 665. This is precisely what the District Court did here, except that it realized that some ceiling should be placed on the Indians' apportionment to prevent their needs from exhausting the entire resource and thereby frustrating the treaty right of \"all [other] citizens of the Territory.\"\n\n\n54\nThus, it first concluded that at the time the treaties were signed, the Indians, who comprised three-fourths of the territorial population, depended heavily on anadromous fish as a source of food, commerce, and cultural cohesion.  Indeed, it found that the non-Indian population depended on Indians to catch the fish that the former consumed.  See supra, at 664-669, and n. 7. Only then did it determine that the Indians' present-day subsistence and commercial needs should be met, subject, of course, to the 50% ceiling.  384 F.Supp., at 342-343.\n\n\n55\nIt bears repeating, however, that the 50% figure imposes a maximum but not a minimum allocation.  As in Arizona v. California and its predecessor cases, the central principle here must be that Indian treaty rights to a natural resource that once was thoroughly and exclusively exploited by the Indians secures so much as, but no more than, is necessary to provide the Indians with a livelihood\u2014that is to say, a moderate living.  Accordingly, while the maximum possible allocation to the Indians is fixed at 50%,27 the minimum is not;  the latter will, upon proper submissions to the District Court, be modified in response to changing circumstances.  If, for example, a tribe should dwindle to just a few members, or if it should find other sources of support that lead it to abandon its fisheries, a 45% or 50% allocation of an entire run that passes through its customary fishing grounds would be manifestly inappropriate because the livelihood of the tribe under those circumstances could not reasonably require an allotment of a large number of fish.\n\n\n56\nAlthough the District Court's exercise of its discretion, as slightly modified by the Court of Appeals, see n. 18, supra, is in most respects unobjectionable, we are not satisfied that all of the adjustments it made to its division are consistent with the preceding analysis.\n\n\n57\nThe District Court determined that the fish taken by the Indians on their reservations should not be counted against their share.  It based this determination on the fact that Indians have the exclusive right under the treaties to fish on their reservations.  But this fact seems to us to have no greater significance than the fact that some nontreaty fishermen may have exclusive access to fishing sites that are not \"usual and accustomed\" places.  Shares in the fish runs should not be affected by the place where the fish are taken.  Cf. Puyallup III, 433 U.S., at 173-177, 97 S.Ct., at 2621-2623.28  We therefore disagree with the District Court's exclusion of the Indians' on-reservation catch from their portion of the runs.29\n\n\n58\nThis same rationale, however, validates the Court-of-Appeals-modified equitable adjustment for fish caught outside the jurisdiction of the State by nontreaty fishermen from the State of Washington.  See n. 18, supra, and accompanying text. So long as they take fish from identifiable runs that are destined for traditional tribal fishing grounds, such persons may not rely on the location of their take to justify excluding it from their share.  Although it is true that the fish involved are caught in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, rather than of the State, see 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1811, 1812, the persons catching them are nonetheless \"citizens of the Territory\" and as such the beneficiaries of the Indians' reciprocal grant of land in the treaties as well as the persons expressly named in the treaties as sharing fishing rights with the Indians.  Accordingly, they may justifiably be treated differently from nontreaty fishermen who are not citizens of Washington.  The statutory provisions just cited are therefore important in this context only because they clearly place a responsibility on the United States, rather than the State, to police the take of fish in the relevant waters by Washington citizens insofar as is necessary to assure compliance with the treaties.\n\n\n59\nOn the other hand, as long as there are enough fish to satisfy the Indians' ceremonial and subsistence needs, we see no justification for the District Court's exclusion from the treaty share of fish caught for these purposes.  We need not now decide whether priority for such uses would be required in a period of short supply in order to carry out the purposes of the treaty. See 384 F.Supp., at 343.  For present purposes, we merely hold that the total catch\u2014rather than the commercial catch\u2014is the measure of each party's right.30\n\n\n60\nAccordingly, any fish (1) taken in Washington waters or in United States waters off the coast of Washington, (2) taken from runs of fish that pass through the Indians' usual and accustomed fishing grounds, and (3) taken by either members of the Indian tribes that are parties to this litigation, on the one hand, or by non-Indian citizens of Washington, on the other hand, shall count against that party's respective share of the fish.\n\nVI\n\n61\nRegardless of the Indians' other fishing rights under the treaties, the State argues that an agreement between Canada and the United States pre-empts their rights with respect to the sockeye and pink salmon runs on the Fraser River.\n\n\n62\nIn 1930, the United States and Canada agreed that the catch of Fraser River salmon should be equally divided between Canadian and American fishermen.  Convention of May 26, 1930, 50 Stat. 1355, as amended by [1957] 8 U.S.T. 1058.  To implement this agreement, the two Governments established the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission (IPSFC).  Each year that Commission proposes regulations to govern the time, manner, and number of the catch by the fishermen of the two countries;  those regulations become effective upon approval of both countries.\n\n\n63\nIn the United States, pursuant to statute and Presidential designation, enforcement of those regulations is vested in the National Marine Fisheries Service, which, in turn, may authorize the State of Washington to act as the enforcing agent.  Sockeye Salmon or Pink Salmon Fishing Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 511, as amended, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 776 et seq. (hereinafter Sockeye Act).  For many years Washington has accepted this responsibility and enacted IPSFC regulations into state statutory law.\n\n\n64\nThe Fraser River salmon run passes through certain \"usual and accustomed\" places of treaty tribes.  The Indians have therefore claimed a share of these runs.  Consistently with its basic interpretation of the Indian treaties, the District Court in its original decision held that the tribes are entitled to up to one-half of the American share of any run that passes through their \"usual and accustomed\" places.  To implement that holding, the District Court also entered an order authorizing the use by Indians of certain gear prohibited by IPSFC regulations then in force.  384 F.Supp., at 392-393, 411.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, 520 F.2d at 689-690, and we denied certiorari.  423 U.S. 1086.\n\n\n65\nIn later proceedings commenced in 1975, the State of Washington contended in the District Court that any Indian rights to Fraser River salmon were extinguished either implicitly by the later agreement with Canada or more directly by the IPSFC regulations promulgated pursuant to those agreements insofar as they are inconsistent with the District Court's order.  The State's claim was rejected by the District Court and the Court of Appeals.  459 F.Supp., at 1050-1056;  573 F.2d, at 1120-1121.\n\n\n66\nFirst, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the Convention itself does not implicitly extinguish the Indians' treaty rights. Absent explicit statutory language, we have been extremely reluctant to find congressional abrogation of treaty rights, e. g., Menominee Tribe v. United States, 391 U.S. 404, 88 S.Ct. 1705, 20 L.Ed.2d 697, and there is no reason to do so here.  Indeed, the Canadian Government has long exempted Canadian Indians from regulations promulgated under the Convention and afforded them special fishing rights.\n\n\n67\nWe also agree with the United States that the conflict between the District Court's order and IPSFC does not present us with a justiciable issue.  The initial conflict occasioned by the regulations for the 1975 season has been mooted by the passage of time, and there is little prospect that a similar conflict will revive and yet evade review.  See DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312, 316, 94 S.Ct. 1704, 1705, 40 L.Ed.2d 164.  Since 1975, the United States, in order to protect the Indian rights, has exercised its power under Art. VI of the Convention and refused to give the necessary approval to those portions of the IPSFC regulations that affected Indian fishing rights.  Those regulations have accordingly not gone into effect in the United States.  The Indians' fishing rights and responsibilities have instead been the subject of separate regulations promulgated by the Interior Department, under its general Indian powers, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 9;  see 25 CFR \u00a7 256.11 et seq. (1978);  50 CFR \u00a7 371.1 et seq. (1978);  25 CFR \u00a7 256.11 et seq. (1979), and enforced by the National Marine Fisheries Service directly, rather than by delegation to the State.  The District Court's order is fully consistent with those regulations.31  To the extent that any Washington State statute imposes any conflicting obligations, the statute is without effect under the Sockeye Act and must give way to the federal treaties, regulations, and decrees. E. g., Missouri v. Holland, 252 U.S. 416, 432, 40 S.Ct. 382, 383, 64 L.Ed. 641.\n\nVII\n\n68\nIn addition to their challenges to the District Court's basic construction of the treaties, and to the scope of its allocation of fish to treaty fishermen, the State and the commercial fishing associations have advanced two objections to various remedial orders entered by the District Court.32  It is claimed that the District Court has ordered a state agency to take action that it has no authority to take as a matter of state law and that its own assumption of the authority to manage the fisheries in the State after the state agencies refused or were unable to do so was unlawful.33\n\n\n69\nThese objections are difficult to evaluate in view of the representations to this Court by the Attorney General of the State that definitive resolution of the basic federal question of construction of the treaties will both remove any state-law impediment to enforcement of the State's obligations under the treaties,34 and enable the State and Fisheries to carry out those obligations.35  Once the state agencies comply, of course, there would be no issue relating to federal authority to order them to do so or any need for the District Court to continue its own direct supervision of enforcement efforts.\n\n\n70\nThe representations of the Attorney General are not binding on the courts and legislature of the State, although we assume they are authoritative within its executive branch.  Moreover, the State continues to argue that the District Court exceeded its authority when it assumed control of the fisheries in the State, and the commercial fishing groups continue to argue that the District Court may not order the state agencies to comply with its orders when they have no state-law authority to do so.  Accordingly, although adherence to the Attorney General's representations by the executive, legislative, and judicial officials in the State would moot these two issues, a brief discussion should foreclose the possibility that they will not be respected.  State-law prohibition against compliance with the District Court's decree cannot survive the command of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.   Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 3 L.Ed.2d 5;  Ableman v. Booth, 21 How. 506, 16 L.Ed. 169.  It is also clear that Game and Fisheries, as parties to this litigation, may be ordered to prepare a set of rules that will implement the Court's interpretation of the rights of the parties even if state law withholds from them the power to do so.  E. g., North Carolina Board of Education v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43, 91 S.Ct. 1284, 28 L.Ed.2d 586;  Griffin v. County School Board, 377 U.S. 218, 84 S.Ct. 1226, 12 L.Ed.2d 496;  Tacoma v. Taxpayers, 357 U.S. 320, 78 S.Ct. 1209, 2 L.Ed.2d 1345.  Once again the answer to a question raised by this litigation is largely dictated by our Puyallup trilogy.  There, this Court mandated that state officers make precisely the same type of allocation of fish as the District Court ordered in this case.  See Puyallup III, 433 U.S., at 177, 97 S.Ct., at 2623.\n\n\n71\nWhether Game and Fisheries may be ordered actually to promulgate regulations having effect as a matter of state law may well be doubtful.  But the District Court may prescind that problem by assuming direct supervision of the fisheries if state recalcitrance or state-law barriers should be continued.  It is therefore absurd to argue, as do the fishing associations, both that the state agencies may not be ordered to implement the decree and also that the District Court may not itself issue detailed remedial orders as a substitute for state supervision.  The federal court unquestionably has the power to enter the various orders that state official and private parties have chosen to ignore, and even to displace local enforcement of those orders if necessary to remedy the violations of federal law found by the court.  E. g., Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 57 L.Ed.2d 522;  Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 280-281, 290, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 53 L.Ed.2d 745;  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 15, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1275, 28 L.Ed.2d 554.  Even if those orders may have been erroneous in some respects, all parties have an unequivocal obligation to obey them while they remain in effect.\n\n\n72\nIn short, we trust that the spirit of cooperation motivating the Attorney General's representation will be confirmed by the conduct of state officials.  But if it is not, the District Court has the power to undertake the necessary remedial steps and to enlist the aid of the appropriate federal law enforcement agents in carrying out those steps.  Moreover, the comments by the Court of Appeals strongly imply that it is prepared to uphold the use of stern measures to require respect for federal-court orders.36\n\n\n73\nThe judgments of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and the Supreme Court of the State of Washington are vacated and the respective causes are remanded to those courts for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, except that the judgment in United States v. Washington, 573 F.2d 1118 (the International Fisheries case) is affirmed.\n\n\n74\nSo ordered.\n\n\n75\nMr. Justice POWELL, with whom Mr. Justice STEWART and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting in part.\n\n\n76\nI join Parts I-III of the Court's opinion.  I am not in agreement, however, with the Court's interpretation of the treaties negotiated in 1854 and 1855 with the Indians of the Washington Territory.  The Court's opinion, as I read it, construes the treaties' provision \"of taking fish  . . .  in common\" as guaranteeing the Indians a specified percentage of the runs of the anadromous fish passing land upon which the Indians traditionally have fished.  Indeed, it takes as a starting point for determining fishing rights an equal division of these fish between Indians and non-Indians.  Ante, at 685 et seq.  As I do not believe that the language and history of the treaties can be construed to support the Court's interpretation, I dissent.\n\n\n77\n* At issue in these cases is the meaning of language found in six similar Indian treaties negotiated and signed in 1854 and 1855.1  Each of the treaties provides substantially that \"[t]he right of taking fish, at all usual and accustomed grounds and stations, is further secured to said Indians, in common with all citizens of the Territory, and of erecting temporary houses for the purpose of curing.\"2  The question before us is whether this \"common\" fishing right is a right only of access to usual and accustomed fishing sites for the purpose of fishing there, or includes the greater right to exclude others from taking a particular portion of the fish that pass through the sites.  As the Court observes, at the time the treaties were signed there was no need to address this question, for the surfeit of fish made lack of access to fishing areas the only constraint upon supply. Nonetheless, I believe that the compelling inference to be drawn from the language and history of the treaties is that the Indians sought and retained only the right to go to their accustomed fishing places and there to fish along with non-Indians.  In addition, the Indians retained the exclusive right to take fish on their reservations, a right not involved in this litigation.  In short, they have a right of access to fish.\n\n\n78\nNothing in the language of the treaties indicates that any party understood that constraints would be placed on the amount of fish that anyone could take, or that the Indians would be guaranteed a percentage of the catch.  Quite to the contrary, the language confers upon non-Indians precisely the same right to fish that it confers upon Indians, even in those areas where the Indians traditionally had fished.  United States v. Winans, 198 U.S. 371, 25 S.Ct. 662, 49 L.Ed. 1089 (1905).  As it cannot be argued that Congress intended to guarantee non-Indians any specified percentage of the available fish, there is neither force nor logic to the argument that the same language\u2014the \"right of taking fish\"\u2014does guarantee such a percentage to Indians.\n\n\n79\nThis conclusion is confirmed by the language used in the treaty negotiated with the Yakima Tribe, which explicitly includes what apparently is implicit in each of the treaties:  the Indians' right to take fish on their reservations is exclusive.  Thus, the Yakima Treaty provides that \"[t]he exclusive right of taking fish in all the streams, where running through or bordering said reservation, is further secured to said confederated tribes and bands of Indians, as also the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places in common with citizens of the Territory  . . . .\"  12 Stat. 953.  There is no reason apparent from the language used in the treaties why the \"right of taking fish\" should mean one thing for purposes of the exclusive right of reservation fishing and quite another for purposes of the \"common\" right of fishing at usual and accustomed places.  Since the Court interprets the right of taking fish in common to be an entitlement to half of the entire catch taken from fisheries passing the Indians' traditional fishing grounds, it therefore should follow that the Court would interpret the exclusive right of taking fish to be an entitlement to all of the fish taken from fisheries passing the Indians' reservations.  But the Court apparently concedes that this exclusive right is not of such Draconian proportions. Indeed, the Court would reduce the Indians' 50% portion by those fish caught on the reservation.  The more reasonable conclusion, therefore, is that when the Indians and Governor Stevens agreed upon a \"right of taking fish,\" they understood this right to be one of access to fish\u2014exclusive access with respect to fishing places on the reservation, and common access with respect to fishing places off the reservation.3\n\n\n80\nIn addition to the language of the treaties, the historical setting in which they were negotiated supports the inference that the fishing rights secured for the Indians were rights of access alone.  The primary purpose of the six treaties negotiated by Governor Stevens was to resolve growing disputes between the settlers claiming title to land in the Washington Territory under the Land Donation Act of 1850, 9 Stat. 437, and the Indians who had occupied the land for generations.  Under the bargain struck in the treaties, the Indians ceded their claims to vast tracts of land, retaining only certain specified areas as reservations, where they would have exclusive rights of possession and use.  In exchange, the Indian tribes were given substantial sums of money and were promised various forms of aid.  See, e. g., Treaty of Medicine Creek, 10 Stat. 1132.  By thus separating the Indians from the settlers it was hoped that friction could be minimized.\n\n\n81\nThe negotiators apparently realized, however, that restricting the Indians to relatively small tracts of land might interfere with their securing food.  See letter of George Gibbs to Captain McClellan, App. 326 (\"[The Indians] require the liberty of motion for the purpose of seeking, in their proper season, roots, berries, and fish\" ).  This necessary \"liberty of motion\" was jeopardized by the title claims of the settlers whose land abutted or would abut\u2014the waterways from which fish traditionally had been caught.  Thus, in Governor Stevens' report to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, he noted the tension between the land rights afforded settlers under the 1850 Land Donation Act and the Indians' need to have some access to the fisheries.  Although he expressed the view that \"[i]t never could have been the intention of Congress that Indians should be excluded from their ancient fisheries,\" he noted that \"no condition to this effect was inserted in the donation act,\" and therefore recommended the question \"should be set at rest by law.\"  Report of Governor Stevens to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, App. 327.  Viewed within this historical context, the common fishing right reserved to the Indians by the treaties of 1854 and 1855 could only have been the right, over and above their exclusive fishing right on their reservations, to roam off the reservations in order to reach fish at the locations traditionally used by the Indians for this purpose.  On the other hand, there is no historical indication that any of the parties to the treaties understood that the Indians would be specifically guaranteed some set portion of the fisheries to which they traditionally had had access.\n\nII\n\n82\nPrior decisions of this Court have prevented the dilution of these treaty rights, but none has addressed the issue now before us.  I read these decisions as supporting the interpretation set forth above.  This is particularly true of United States v. Winans, supra, the case most directly relevant.  In that case a settler had constructed several fish wheels in the Columbia River.  These fish wheels were built at locations where the Indians traditionally had fished, and \" 'necessitate[d] the exclusive possession of the space occupied by the wheels,' \" 198 U.S., at 380, 25 S.Ct., at 664, thereby interfering with the Indians' treaty right of access to fish.  This Court reviewed in some detail the precise nature of the Indians' fishing rights under the Yakima Treaty, and concluded:\n\n\n83\n\"[The treaties] reserved rights  . . .  to every      individual Indian, as though named therein.  They imposed a      servitude upon every piece of land as though described      therein.  There was an exclusive right of fishing reserved      within certain boundaries.  There was a right outside of      those boundaries reserved 'in common with citizens of the      Territory.'  As a mere right, it was not exclusive in the      Indians.  Citizens might share it, but the Indians were      secured in its enjoyment by a special provision of means for      its exercise.  They were given 'the right of taking fish at      all usual and accustomed places,' and the right 'of erecting      temporary buildings for curing them.'  The contingency of the      future ownership of the lands, therefore, was foreseen and      provided for;  in other words, the Indians were given a right      in the land,\u2014the right of crossing it to the river,\u2014the right      to occupy it to the extent and for the purpose mentioned.  No      other conclusion would give effect to the treaty.\"  Id., at      381, 25 S.Ct., at 664 (emphasis added).\n\n\n84\nThe Court thus viewed these treaties as intended to \"giv[e] a right in the land\"\u2014a \"servitude\" upon all non-Indian land\u2014to enable Indians to fish \"in common with citizens of the Territory.\" The focus was on access to the traditional fishing areas for the purpose of enjoying the \"right of fishing.\"   Ibid.  The Winans Court concluded, on the facts before it, that the right of access to fish in these areas had been abridged.  It stated that \"[i]n the actual taking of fish white men may not be confined to a spear or crude net, but it does not follow that they may construct and use a device which gives them exclusive possession of the fishing places, as it is admitted a fish wheel does.\"  Id., at 382, 25 S.Ct., at 664 (emphasis added).  Thus, Winans was decided solely upon the basis of a treaty-secured right of access to fish.  Moreover, the Court's analysis of the treaty right at issue in Winans strongly indicates that nothing more than a right of access fairly could be inferred from the treaty.4\n\n\n85\nNor do the Puyallup cases interpret the treaties to require that any specified proportion of the catch be reserved for Indians.  Indeed, Puyallup Tribe v. Washington Game Dept., 391 U.S. 392, 88 S.Ct. 1725, 20 L.Ed.2d 689 (1968) (Puyallup I ), consistently with Winans, described the right of Indians under the treaties as \"the right to fish 'at all usual and accustomed places.' \"  391 U.S., at 398, 88 S.Ct., at 1728.5  The issue before the Court in Puyallup I was the extent to which the State could regulate fishing.  It held:\n\n\n86\n\"[T]he 'right' to fish outside the reservation was a      treaty 'right' that could not be qualified or conditioned by the      State.  But 'the time and manner of fishing  . . .  necessary      for the conservation of fish,' not being defined or      established by the treaty, were within the reach of state      power.\"   Id., at 399, 88 S.Ct., at ---.\n\n\n87\nThe Court today finds support for its views in Puyallup I because the Court there recognized that, apart from conservation measures, the State could not impose restrictive regulations on the treaty rights of Indians.  But it does not follow from this that an affirmative right to a specified percentage of the catch is guaranteed by the treaties to Indians or to non-Indians, for the Court misapprehends the nature of the basic right sought to be preserved by Congress.  This, as noted above, was a right of the Indians to reach their usual and accustomed fishing areas.  Put differently, this right, described in Winans as a servitude or right over land not owned by the Indians, entitled the Indians to trespass on any land when necessary to reach their traditional fishing areas, and is a right not enjoyed by non-Indian residents of the area.\n\n\n88\nIn permitting the State to place limitations on the Indians' access rights when conservation so requires, the Court went further in Puyallup I and suggested that even regulations thus justified would have to satisfy the requirements of \"equal protection implicit in the phrase 'in common with.' \"  391 U.S., at 403, 88 S.Ct., at 1731.  Accordingly, in Washington Game Dept. v. Puyallup Tribe, 414 U.S. 44, 94 S.Ct. 330, 38 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973) (Puyallup II ), we considered whether the conservation measures taken by the State had been evenhanded in the treatment of the Indians.  At issue was a Washington State ban on all net fishing\u2014by both Indians and non-Indians\u2014for steelhead trout in the Puyallup River.  According to testimony before the trial court, the annual run of steelhead trout in the Puyallup River was between 16,000 and 18,000, while unlimited sport fishing would result in the taking of between 12,000 and 14,000 steelhead annually.  Because the escape of at least 25% of the entire run was required for hatcheries and spawning, the sport fishing totally pre-empted all commercial fishing by Indians.  The State therefore imposed a ban on all net fishing.  The Indians claimed that this ban amounted to an improper subordination of their treaty rights to the privilege of recreational fishing enjoyed by non-Indians.\n\n\n89\nWe held in Puyallup II that the ban on net fishing, as it applied to Indians covered by treaty, was an infringement of their rights.  The State in the name of conservation was discriminating against the Indians \"because all Indian net fishing is barred and only hook-and-line fishing, entirely preempted by non-Indians, is allowed.\"  Id., at 48, 94 S.Ct., at 333.  Because \"[o]nly an expert could fairly estimate what degree of net fishing plus fishing by hook and line would allow the escapement of fish necessary for perpetuation of the species,\"  ibid., we remanded to the Washington courts for a fair apportionment of the steelhead run between Indian net fishing and non-Indian sport fishing.\n\n\n90\nRelying upon the reference in Puyallup II to \"apportionment,\" the Court expansively reads the decision in that case as strongly implying, if not holding, that the catch at Indians' \"accustomed\" fishing sites must be apportioned between Indian and non-Indian fishermen.  This view certainly is not a necessary reading of Puyallup II.  Indeed, I view it as a quite unjustified extension of that case.  Puyallup II addressed an extremely narrow situation:  where there had been \"discrimination\" by state regulations under which \"all Indian net fishing [was] barred and only hook-and-line fishing, entirely pre-empted by non-Indians, [was] allowed.\"  Ibid.  In any event, to the extent language in Puyallup II may be read as supporting some general apportionment of the catch, it is dictum that is plainly incompatible with the language and historical understanding of these treaties.6\n\n\n91\nEmerging from our decisions in Winans, Puyallup I, and Puyallup II, therefore, is the proper approach to interpretation of the Indians' common fishing rights at the present time, when demand outstrips supply.  The Indians have the right to go to their traditional fishing grounds to fish.  Once there, they cannot be restricted in their methods or in the size of their take, save insofar as restrictions are required for conserving the fisheries from which they draw.  Even in situations where such regulations are required, however, the State must be evenhanded in limiting Indian and non-Indian fishing activity.  It is not free to make the determination\u2014apparently made by Washington with respect to the ban on net fishing in the Puyallup River\u2014that Indian fishing rights will be totally subordinated to the interests of non-Indians.7\n\nIII\n\n92\nIn my view, the District Court below\u2014and now this Court\u2014has formulated an apportionment doctrine that cannot be squared with the language or history of the treaties, or indeed with the prior decisions of this Court.  The application of this doctrine, and particularly the construction of the term \"in common\" as requiring a basic 50-50 apportionment, is likely to result in an extraordinary economic windfall to Indian fishermen in the commercial fish market by giving them a substantial position in the market wholly protected from competition from non-Indian fishermen.8  Indeed, non-Indian fishermen apparently will be required from time to time to stay out of fishing areas completely while Indians catch their court-decreed allotment.  In sum, the District Court's decision will discriminate quite unfairly against non-Indians.9\n\n\n93\nTo be sure, if it were necessary to construe the treaties to produce these results, it would be our duty so to construe them. But for the reasons stated above, I think the Court's construction virtually ignores the historical setting and purposes of the treaties, considerations that bear compellingly upon a proper reading of their language.  Nor do the prior decisions of this Court support or justify what seems to me to be a substantial reformation of the bargain struck with the Indians in 1854-1855.\n\n\n94\nI would hold that the treaties give to the Indians several significant rights that should be respected.  As made clear in Winans, the purpose of the treaties was to assure to Indians the right of access over private lands so that they could continue to fish at their usual and accustomed fishing grounds.  Indians also have the exclusive right to fish on their reservations, and are guaranteed enough fish to satisfy their ceremonial and subsistence needs.  Moreover, as subsequently construed, the treaties exempt Indians from state regulation (including the payment of license fees) except as necessary for conservation in the interest of all fishermen.  Finally, under Puyallup II, it is settled that even a facially neutral conservation regulation is invalid if its effect is to discriminate against Indian fishermen.  These rights, privileges, and exemptions\u2014possessed only by Indians\u2014are quite substantial.  I find no basis for according them additional advantages.\n\n\n\n1\n By three earlier treaties the United States had extinguished the conflicting claims of Spain in 1820 and Russia in 1824, 8 Stat. 252, 302, and Great Britain in 1846, 9 Stat. 869. In 1848, Congress established the Oregon Territory, 9 Stat. 323; that statute provided that nothing contained therein \"shall be construed to impair the rights of person or property now pertaining to the Indians in said Territory, so long as such rights shall remain unextinguished by treaty between the United States and such Indians.\"  In 1850, Congress authorized the negotiation of treaties to extinguish the Indian claims to land lying west of the Cascade Mountains, 9 Stat. 437.  In 1853, the Washington Territory, which includes the present State of Washington, was organized out of the Oregon Territory.  Ch. 90, 10 Stat. 172.\n\n\n2\n Treaty of Medicine Creek (10 Stat. 1132);  Treaty of Point Elliott (12 Stat. 927);  Treaty of Point No Point (12 Stat. 933); Treaty of Neah Bay (12 Stat. 939);  Treaty with the Yakamas (12 Stat. 951);  and Treaty of Olympia (12 Stat. 971).  The parties to the treaties and to this litigation include these Indian tribes: Hoh;  Lower Elwha Band of Clallam Indians;  Lummi;  Makah; Muckleshoot;  Nisqually;  Nooksack;  Port Gamble Band of Clallam Indians;  Puyallup;  Quileute;  Quinault;  Sauk-Suiattle; Skokomish;  Squaxin Island;  Stillaguamish;  Suquamish; Swinomish;  Tulalip;  Upper Skagit;  and Yakima Nation.  D.C., 384 F.Supp. 312, 349;  D.C., 459 F.Supp. 1020, 1028.\n\n\n3\n For example, pink and sockeye salmon hatched in Canada's Fraser River pass through the Strait of Juan de Fuca in the State of Washington, swim out into international waters on the open sea, and return through the strait to the river, passing on the way the usual and accustomed fishing grounds of the Makah Indian Tribe once again in Washington.  384 F.Supp., at 392.  During much of the return run during which they pass through international, state, and Canadian waters, the fish are in optimum harvestable condition.  See also id., at 386-387, regarding the Puget Sound and Olympic Peninsula origin chinook salmon that pass through international waters, as well as those of Washington, Canada, and Alaska.\n\n\n4\n Although in terms of the number and weight of the fish involved, the commercial salmon catch is far more substantial than the recreational steelhead catch, the latter apparently provides the State with more revenue than the former, involves more people, and has accordingly been a more controversial political issue within the State.  See id., at 399.\n\n\n5\n Indeed, the record shows that the territorial officials who negotiated the treaties on behalf of the United States took the initiative in aggregating certain loose bands into designated tribes and even appointed many of the chiefs who signed the treaties.  Id., at 354-355, 366.\n\n\n6\n \"From the earliest known times, up to and beyond the time of the  . . .  treaties, the Indians comprising each of the treating tribes and bands were primarily a fishing, hunting and gathering people dependent almost entirely upon the natural animal and vegetative resources of the region for their subsistence and culture.  They were heavily dependent upon anadromous fish for their subsistence and for trade with other tribes and later with the settlers.  Anadromous fish was the great staple of their diet and livelihood.  They cured and dried large quantities for year around use, both for themselves and for others through sale, trade, barter and employment.\"  Id., at 406.  See also 520 F.2d 676, 682 (\"The Indians west of the Cascade Mountains were known as 'fish-eaters';  their diets, social customs, and religious practices centered on the capture of fish\").\n\n\n7\n \"At the time of the treaties, trade was carried on among the Indian groups throughout a wide geographic area.  Fish was a basic element of the trade.  There is some evidence that the volume of this intra-tribal trade was substantial, but it is not possible to compare it with the volume of present day commercial trading in salmon.  Such trading was, however, important to the Indians at the time of the treaties.  In addition to potlatching, which is a system of exchange between communities in a social context often typified by competitive gifting, there was a considerable amount of outright sale and trade beyond the local community and sometimes over great distances.  In the decade immediately preceding the treaties, Indian fishing increased in order to accommodate increased demand for local non-Indian consumption and for export, as well as to provide money for purchase of introduced commodities and to obtain substitute non-Indian goods for native products which were no longer available because of the non-Indian movement into the area.  Those involved in negotiating the treaties recognized the contribution that Indian fishermen made to the territorial economy because Indians caught most of the non-Indians' fish for them, plus clams and oysters.\"  384 F.Supp., at 351-352 (citations to record omitted).  See also id., at 364 (Makah Tribe \"maintained from time immemorial a thriving economy based on commerce\" in \"marine resources\").\n\n\n8\n In late December 1854, one territorial official wrote the Commissioner of Indian Affairs that \"[t]he Indians on Puget Sound . . .  form a very considerable portion of the trade of the Sound. . . .  They catch most of our fish, supplying not only our people with clams and oysters, but salmon to those who cure and export it.\"  App. 329.\n\n\n9\n Governor Stevens in discussing the policy that he intended to pursue during negotiations with the tribes, in a letter dated September 16, 1854, to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, said:\n\"The subject of the right of fisheries is one upon which legislation is demanded.  It never could have been the intention of Congress that Indians should be excluded from their ancient fisheries;  but, as no condition to this effect was inserted in the donation act, the question has been raised whether persons taking claims, including such fisheries, do not possess the right of monopolizing.  It is therefore desirable that this question should be set at rest by law.\"  Id., at 327.  See also id., at 332.\nThe Governor's concern with protecting the Indians' continued exploitation of their accustomed fisheries was reflected in his assurances to the Indians during the treaty negotiations that under the treaties they would be able to go outside of reservation areas for the purpose of harvesting fish.  His statement at the signing of the Treaty of Point Elliott on Monday, January 22, 1855, was characteristic:\n\"We want to place you in homes where you can cultivate the soil, using potatoes and other articles of food, and where you will be able to pass in canoes over the waters of the Sound and catch fish and back to the mountains to get roots and berries.\" Id., at 329-330.\n\n\n10\n Indeed, the translation of the English words was difficult because the interpreter used a \"Chinook jargon\" to explain treaty terms, and that jargon not only was imperfectly (and often not) understood by many of the Indians but also was composed of a simple 300-word commercial vocabulary that did not include words corresponding to many of the treaty terms.  384 F.Supp., at 330, 355-356, 364, 381;  520 F.2d, at 683.\n\n\n11\n For example, Governor Stevens made the following statement to the Indians gathered at Point-No-Point to negotiate the treaty bearing that name:\n\"Are you not my children and also children of the Great Father?  What will I not do for my children, and what will you not for yours?  Would you not die for them?  This paper is such as a man would give to his children and I will tell you why.  This paper gives you a home.  Does not a father give his children a home?  . . .  This paper secures your fish.  Does not a father give food to his children?\"  App. 330-331.\n\n\n12\n \"There is nothing in the written records of the treaty councils or other accounts of discussions with the Indians to indicate that the Indians were told that their existing fishing activities or tribal control over them would in any way be restricted or impaired by the treaty.  The most that could be implied from the treaty context is that the Indians may have been told or understood that non-Indians would be allowed to take fish at the Indian fishing locations along with the Indians.\"  384 F.Supp., at 357.\n\n\n13\n \"The non-Indian commercial fishing industry did not fully develop in the case area until after the invention and perfection of the canning process.  The first salmon cannery in Puget Sound began in 1877 with a small operation at Mukilteo.  Large-scale development of the commercial fisheries did not commence in Puget Sound until the mid-1890's.  The large-scale development of the commercial fishing industry in the last decades of the Nineteenth Century brought about the need for regulation of fish harvests.\" Id., at 352 (record citations omitted).  See also id., at 406.\n\n\n14\n The impact of illegal regulation, see Tulee v. Washington, 315 U.S. 681, 62 S.Ct. 862, 86 L.Ed. 1115, and of illegal exclusionary tactics by non-Indians, see United States v. Winans, 198 U.S. 371, 25 S.Ct. 662, 49 L.Ed. 1089, in large measure accounts for the decline of the Indian fisheries during this century and renders that decline irrelevant to a determination of the fishing rights the Indians assumed they were securing by initialing the treaties in the middle of the last century.\n\n\n15\n The \"harvestable\" amount of fish is determined by subtracting from the total number of fish in each run the number that must be allowed to escape for conservation purposes.\nThe \"case area\" was defined by the District Court as\n\"that portion of the State of Washington west of the Cascade Mountains and north of the Columbia River drainage area, and includes the American portion of the Puget Sound watershed, the watersheds of the Olympic Peninsula north of the Grays Harbor watershed, and the offshore waters adjacent to those areas.\"  384 F.Supp., at 328.\n\n\n16\n A factual dispute exists on the question of what percentage of the fish in the case area actually passes through Indian fishing areas and is therefore subject to the District Court's allocations.  In the absence of any relevant findings by the courts below, we are unable to express any view on the matter.\n\n\n17\n Moreover, fish caught by individual Indians at off-reservation locations that are not \"usual and accustomed\" sites, were treated as if they had been caught by nontreaty fishermen.  384 F.Supp., at 410.\n\n\n18\n The Court of Appeals held that fish caught by nonresidents of Washington should be eliminated from the equitable adjustment for fish caught beyond the State's jurisdiction.  520 F.2d, at 689.\n\n\n19\n Despite our earlier denial of certiorari on the treaty interpretation issue, we decline the Government's invitation to treat the matter as having been finally adjudicated.  Our earlier denial came at an interlocutory stage in the proceedings\u2014the District Court has retained continuing enforcement jurisdiction over the case\u2014so that we certainly are not required to treat the earlier disposition as final for our purposes.   Reece v. Georgia, 350 U.S. 85, 87, 76 S.Ct. 167, 169, 100 L.Ed. 77.  Moreover, the reason for our recent grant of certiorari on the question remains because the state courts are\u2014and, at least since the State Supreme Court's decision in Department of Game v. Puyallup Tribe, 86 Wash.2d 664, 548 P.2d 1058 (1976), have been\u2014on record as interpreting the treaties involved differently from the federal courts.  Accordingly, there is strong reason not to treat it as final as a discretionary matter.\n\n\n20\n The Washington Supreme Court held that the treaties would violate equal protection principles if they provided fishing rights to Indians that were not also available to non-Indians. The simplest answer to this argument is that this Court has already held that these treaties confer enforceable special benefits on signatory Indian tribes, e. g., Tulee v. Washington, 315 U.S. 681, 62 S.Ct. 862, 86 L.Ed. 1115;  United States v. Winans, 198 U.S. 371, 25 S.Ct. 662, 49 L.Ed. 1089, and has repeatedly held that the peculiar semisovereign and constitutionally recognized status of Indians justifies special treatment on their behalf when rationally related to the Government's \"unique obligation toward the Indians.\"  Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 555, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 2485, 41 L.Ed.2d 290. See United States v. Antelope, 430 U.S. 641, 97 S.Ct. 1395, 51 L.Ed.2d 701;  Antoine v. Washington, 420 U.S. 194, 95 S.Ct. 944, 43 L.Ed.2d 129.  See also Fishing Vessel Assn. v. Tollefson, 89 Wash.2d 276, 287-288, 571 P.2d 1373, 1379-1380 (1977) (Utter, J. dissenting).\n\n\n21\n The language is quoted from Art. III of the Treaty of Medicine Creek, 10 Stat. 1133.  Identical, or almost identical, language is included in each of the other treaties.\n\n\n22\n The State characterizes its interpretation of the treaty language as assuring Indians and non-Indians an \"equal opportunity\" to take fish from the State's waters.  This appellation is misleading.  In the first place, even the State recognizes that the treaties provide Indians with certain rights i. e., the right to fish without a license and to cross private lands\u2014that non-Indians do not have.  See Tulee v. Washington, 315 U.S. 681, 62 S.Ct. 862, 86 L.Ed. 1115;  Seufert Bros. Co. v. United States, 249 U.S. 194, 39 S.Ct. 203, 63 L.Ed. 555;  United States v. Winans, 198 U.S. 371, 25 S.Ct. 662, 49 L.Ed. 1089.  See also Puyallup Tribe v. Washington Dept. of Game, 433 U.S. 165, 97 S.Ct. 2616, 53 L.Ed. 667.  Whatever opportunities the treaties assure Indians with respect to fish are admittedly not \"equal\" to, but are to some extent greater than, those afforded other citizens.  It is therefore simply erroneous to suggest that the treaty language \"confers upon non-Indians precisely the same right to fish that it confers upon Indians.\"  Powell, J., dissenting, post, at 698.\nMoreover, in light of the far superior numbers, capital resources, and technology of the non-Indians, the concept of the Indians' \"equal opportunity \" to take advantage of a scarce resource is likely in practice to mean that the Indians' \"right of taking fish\" will net them virtually no catch at all.  For the \"opportunity\" is at best theoretical.  Indeed, in 1974, before the\nDistrict Court's injunction took effect, and while the Indians were still operating under the \"equal opportunity\" doctrine, their take amounted to approximately 2% of the total harvest of salmon and trout in the treaty area.  459 F.Supp., at 1032.\n\n\n23\n The State argues that at common law a \"common fishery\" was merely a nonexclusive right of access, see 3 J. Kent, Commentaries 412 (5th ed. 1844), and that the right of a fishery was appurtenant to specific parcels of real property.  The State does not suggest, however, that these concepts were understood by, or explained to, the Indians.  Indeed, there is no evidence that Governor Stevens understood them, although one of his advisers, George Gibbs, was a lawyer.\nBut even if we indulge in the highly dubious assumption that Gibbs was learned in the intricacies of water law, that he incorporated them in the treaties, and that he explained them fully to the Indians, the treaty language would still be subject to the different interpretations presented by the parties to this litigation.  For in addition to \"common fisheries,\" the \"in common with\" language was used in two other relevant senses during the period.  First, a \"common of fishery\" meant a limited right, acquired from the previously exclusive owner of certain fishing rights (in this case the Indians), \"of taking fish in common with certain others in waters flowing through [the grantor's] land.\" J. Gould, Laws of Waters \u00a7 183 (3d ed. 1900) (emphasis added); see 3 Kent, supra, at 410.  Under that understanding of the language, it would hardly make sense that the Indians effectively relinquished all of their fishing rights by granting a merely nonexclusive right.\nEven more to the point, the United States had previously used the \"in common with\" language in two treaties with Britain, including one signed in 1854, that dealt with fishing rights in certain waters adjoining the United States and Canada.  Treaty of Oct. 20, 1818, 8 Stat. 248;  Treaty of June 5, 1854, 10 Stat. 1089.  As interpreted by the Department of State during the 19th century, these treaties gave each signatory country an \"equal\" and apportionable \"share\" of the take of fish in the treaty areas. See H.R.Ex.Doc. No. 84, 46th Cong., 2d Sess., 7 (1880);  5 American State Papers (For.Rel.) 528-529 (1823);  J. Q. Adams, The Duplicate Letters, The Fisheries and the Mississippi, 184-185 (1822).\n\n\n24\n Puyallup Tribe v. Washington Game Dept., 391 U.S. 392, 88 S.Ct. 1725, 20 L.Ed.2d 689 (Puyallup I );  Washington Game Dept. v. Puyallup Tribe, 414 U.S. 44, 94 S.Ct. 330, 38 L.Ed.2d 254 (Puyallup II );  and Puyallup Tribe v. Washington Game Dept., 433 U.S. 165, 97 S.Ct. 2616, 53 L.Ed.2d 667 (Puyallup III ).\n\n\n25\n Mr. Justice Douglas wrote for the Court:\n\"The right to fish 'at all usual and accustomed' places may, of course, not be qualified by the State  . . . .  But the manner of fishing, the size of the take, the restriction of commercial fishing, and the like may be regulated by the State in the interest of conservation, provided the regulation meets appropriate standards and does not discriminate against the Indians.\"  391 U.S., at 398, 88 S.Ct., at 1728.\nIn describing the \"appropriate standards\" referred to, Mr. Justice Douglas continued:\n\"As to a 'regulation' concerning the time and manner of fishing  . . .,  the power of the State [is] measured by whether [the regulation is] 'necessary for the conservation of fish.' [Tulee,] 315 U.S., at 684, 62 S.Ct., at 864.\n\"The measure of the legal propriety of those kinds of conservation measures is therefore distinct from the federal constitutional standard concerning the scope of the police power of a State.  See Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726, 83 S.Ct. 1028, 10 L.Ed.2d 93  . . . .\"  Id., at 402 n. 14, 88 S.Ct., at 1730 n. 14.\nSee also Antoine v. Washington, 420 U.S., at 207-208, 95 S.Ct., at 951-952;  Tulee, 315 U.S., at 684, 62 S.Ct., at 864; Winans, 198 U.S., at 384, 25 S.Ct., at 665;  Ward v. Race Horse, 163 U.S. 504, 16 S.Ct. 1076, 41 L.Ed. 244.\n\n\n26\n Although some members of the Washington Supreme Court in their opinions in Puyallup III expressed the view that the treaties could not be interpreted as affording treaty fishermen an allocable share of the fish, Department of Game v. Puyallup Tribe, 86 Wash.2d, at 674-681, 548 P.2d, at 1066-1070;  see id., at 690-698, 548 P.2d, at 1075-1080 (Rosellini, J., concurring);  but see id., at 688-690, 548 P.2d, at 1074-1075 (Stafford, C. J., concurring in result), they recognized that any other interpretation would be inconsistent with \"the express language on the face of [this Court's decision in] Puyallup II  . . . .\"\n\n\n27\n Because the 50% figure is only a ceiling, it is not correct to characterize our holding \"as guaranteeing the Indians a specified percentage\" of the fish.  See POWELL, J., dissenting, post, at 697.\nThe logic of the 50% ceiling is manifest.  For an equal division\u2014especially between parties who presumptively treated with each other as equals\u2014is suggested, if not necessarily dictated, by the word \"common\" as it appears in the treaties.  Since the days of Solomon, such a division has been accepted as a fair apportionment of a common asset, and Anglo-American common law has presumed that division when, as here, no other percentage is suggested by the language of the agreement or the surrounding circumstances.  E. g., 2 American Law of Property \u00a7 6.5, p. 19 (A. Casner ed. 1952);  E. Hopkins, Handbook on the Law of Real Property \u00a7 209, p. 336 (1896).\n\n\n28\n This Court's decision in Puyallup III, which approved state regulation of on-reservation fishing in the interest of conservation, was issued after the District Court excluded the Indians' on-reservation take and the Court of Appeals affirmed. See 520 F.2d, at 690.\n\n\n29\n A like reasoning requires the fish taken by treaty fishermen off the reservations and at locations other than \"usual and accustomed\" sites, see n. 17, supra, to be counted as part of the Indians' share.  Of course, the District Court, in its discretion, may determine that so few fish fit into this, or any other, category (e. g., \"take-home\" fish caught by nontreaty commercial fishermen for personal use) that accounting for them individually is unnecessary, and that an estimated figure may be relied on in making the annual computation.  Indeed, if the amount is truly de minimis, no accounting at all may be required.\n\n\n30\n The Government suggests that the District Court's exclusion of the \"take-home\" catch of nontreaty fishermen from the nontreaty share makes up for any losses to those fishermen occasioned by the exclusion of the Indians' ceremonial and subsistence take.  We see nothing in the District Court's findings to verify this allegation, see 384 F.Supp., at 343, although the District Court may wish to address the issue in this light on remand.\nAlthough there is some discussion in the briefs concerning whether the treaties give Indians the same right to take hatchery-bred fish as they do to take native fish, the District Court has not yet reached a final decision on this issue, see 459 F.Supp., at 1072-1085, and it is not therefore fairly subsumed within our grant of certiorari.  See Puyallup III, 433 U.S., at 177 n. 17, 97 S.Ct., at 2623 n. 17.\n\n\n31\n Although the IPSFC has refused to accede to the suggestions of the United States that special regulations be promulgated to cover the Indian fisheries, we are informed by the Solicitor General that the Canadian Government has no objection to those suggestions, has unilaterally implemented similar rules on behalf of its own Indians, and has expressed no dissatisfaction with the unilateral actions taken by the United States in this regard.  Brief for United States 40 n. 26.\nBecause the Department of the Interior regulations assure that no disproportion will occur, the equitable adjustment ordered by the District Court to cover the possibility that IPSFC regulations would result in a disproportionate nontreaty take will not be effectuated.  We accordingly have no issue before us concerning the validity of that adjustment.\n\n\n32\n The associations advance a third objection as well\u2014that the District Court had no power to enjoin individual nontreaty fishermen, who were not parties to its decisions, from violating the allocations that it has ordered.  The reason this issue has arisen is that state officials were either unwilling or unable to enforce the District Court's orders against nontreaty fishermen by way of state regulations and state law enforcement efforts. Accordingly, nontreaty fishermen were openly violating Indian fishing rights, and, in order to give federal law enforcement officials the power via contempt to end those violations, the District Court was forced to enjoin them.  459 F.Supp., at 1043, 1098-1099, 1113-1117.  The commercial fishing organizations, on behalf of their individual members, argue that they should not be bound by these orders because they were not parties to (although the associations all did participate as amici curiae in) the proceedings that led to their issuance.\nIf all state officials stand by the Attorney General's representations that the State will implement the decision of this Court, see nn. 34 and 35, infra, this issue will be rendered moot because the District Court no longer will be forced to enforce its own decisions.  Nonetheless, the issue is still live since state implementation efforts are now at a standstill and the orders are still in effect.  Accordingly, we must decide it.\nIn our view, the commercial fishing associations and their members are probably subject to injunction under either the rule that nonparties who interfere with the implementation of court orders establishing public rights may be enjoined, e. g., United States v. Hall, 472 F.2d 261 (CA5 1972), cited approvingly in Golden State Bottling Co. v. NLRB, 414 U.S. 168, 180, 94 S.Ct. 414, 423, 38 L.Ed.2d 388, or the rule that a court possessed of the res in a proceeding in rem, such as one to apportion a fishery, may enjoin those who would interfere with that custody. See Vendo Co. v. Lektro-Vend Corp., 433 U.S. 623, 641, 97 S.Ct. 2881, 2892, 53 L.Ed.2d 1009.  But in any case, these individuals and groups are citizens of the State of Washington, which was a party to the relevant proceedings, and \"they, in their common public rights as citizens of the State, were represented by the State in those proceedings, and, like it, were bound by the judgment.\"  Tacoma v. Taxpayers, 357 U.S. 320, 340-341, 78 S.Ct. 1209, 1221, 2 L.Ed.2d 1345.  Moreover, a court clearly may order them to obey that judgment.  See Golden State Bottling, supra, 414 U.S., at 179-180, 94 S.Ct., at 422-423.\n\n\n33\n The State has also argued that absent congressional legislation the treaties involved here are not enforceable.  This argument flies directly in the face of Art. XIII of the treaties which states that they \"shall be obligatory on the contracting parties as soon as [they are] ratified by the President and Senate of the United States.\"  Moreover, the argument was implicitly rejected in Winans and our ensuing decisions regarding these treaties, all of which assumed that the treaties are self-enforcing.  E. g., Puyallup I, 391 U.S., at 397-398, 88 S.Ct., at 1725, 1728.\nSignificantly, Congress thrice rejected efforts in the early 1960's to terminate the Indians' fishing rights under these treaties.  See S.J.Res. 170 and 171, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. (1964); H.J.Res. 48, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. (1963);  H.J.Res. 698, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. (1962).\n\n\n34\n In his brief, the Attorney General represented:\n\"If this Court now concludes that Indian treaty fishermen and all other fishermen are not members of the same class with respect to an allocation of fishery, it will thereby lay the foundation for the validity under state law of a separate classification of treaty Indian fishermen for the purpose of allocation.  We would respectfully submit that if the Court rejects our earlier argument and finds that treaty Indian fishermen are a special class for allocation purposes, such a conclusion would remove the impediment found by the Washington Supreme Court to the exercise of necessary regulatory power by the Department of Fisheries to allocate between Indian and non-Indian fishermen.\n*          *          *          *          *\n\"Fisheries will be able to comply with the Court's decision in this case even if it requires some type of allocation of the fishery.\"  Brief for the State of Washington 99.\nSee also Department of Game v. Puyallup Tribe, 86 Wash.2d 664, 681, 684-688, 548 P.2d 1058, 1070, 1072-1074 (1976), in which the Washington Supreme Court held that the Department of Game had authority to allocate a certain portion of the steelhead trout run on the Puyallup River to treaty fishermen.\n\n\n35\n According to the Attorney General:\n\"The State of Washington and its Department of Fisheries cannot emphasize too strongly that they do not propose to inhibit the enforcement of proper federal court orders.  . . .\n*          *          *          *          *\n\"Whatever the decision of this Court, the state will implement it.  The state believes that after a decision by this Court it will be in a position to comply with District Court orders, if the same are necessary to comply with this Court's decision.  We do not believe the state courts could or would take a different point of view:  We are confident that they will accede to this Court's interpretation of the treaties in the future just as they have in the past, as this Court expressly found in Puyallup III, [433 U.S.,] at 177 [97 S.Ct. 2616, 2623, 53 L.Ed.2d 667].\"  Brief for State of Washington, 95, 96.\nWe note the omission of the same firm representation on behalf of the Game Department.  Although the history of that agency is not nearly as favorable as that of Fisheries with respect to attempting to comply with the District Court's order, e. g., 384 F.Supp., at 395, 398;  459 F.Supp., at 1043, 1045, 1099, we assume that this omission stems from the fact that only Fisheries was named as a party in the litigation in the state courts regarding the state agencies' authority to comply with the District Court's order.  See 88 Wash.2d, at 679, 565 P.2d, at 1152.  See also Department of Game v. Puyallup Tribe, discussed in n. 34, supra.\n\n\n36\n \"The state's extraordinary machinations in resisting the [1974] decree have forced the district court to take over a large share of the management of the state's fishery in order to enforce its decrees.  Except for some desegregation cases  . . ., the district court has faced the most concerted official and private efforts to frustrate a decree of a federal court witnessed in this century.  The challenged orders in this appeal must be reviewed by this court in the context of events forced by litigants who offered the court no reasonable choice.\"  573 F.2d 1123, 1126 (CA9 1978).\n\n\n1\n Treaty of Medicine Creek, 10 Stat. 1132;  Treaty of Point Elliott, 12 Stat. 927;  Treaty of Point No Point, 12 Stat. 933; Treaty with the Makahs, 12 Stat. 939;  Treaty with the Yakamas, 12 Stat. 951;  Treaty of Olympia, 12 Stat. 971.\n\n\n2\n Treaty of Medicine Creek, 10 Stat. 1133 (emphasis supplied).  There were some slight, immaterial variations in the language used.  See, e. g., Treaty with the Yakamas, quoted infra, at 698.\n\n\n3\n Indeed, if the Court's interpretation of the treaties were correct, then the exclusive right with respect to reservation fishing would be largely superfluous.  If the Indians had the right to 50%, and no more, of the fish irrespective of where they are caught, then it hardly would be of any great value to them that they could keep others from taking fish from locations on the reservation.  The most reasonable way to interpret the exclusive right of reservation fishing so that it was of value, therefore, is as a special right of access.\n\n\n4\n The Government's brief in Winans, cited approvingly by the Court in that case, indicates that the Government also understood the treaty to guarantee nothing more than access rights to traditional fishing locations.  In that brief, the Government advocated only \"a way of easy access, free ingress and egress to and from the fishing grounds.\"  Brief for Appellants, O.T. 1904, No. 180, p. 56.\nThis interpretation of Winans was unequivocally affirmed by the Court a short time later in Seufert Bros. Co. v. United States, 249 U.S. 194, 39 S.Ct. 203, 63 L.Ed. 555 (1919).  At issue in that case was whether Indians from the Yakima Nation had the right under their treaty to cross the Columbia River and fish from the south bank, which admittedly had belonged to other tribes at the time of the treaty.  The Court viewed Seufert, a case unquestionably involving only the right of access, to be squarely controlled by its earlier decision in Winans.  249 U.S., at 198, 39 S.Ct., at 205.  Moreover, the Court reaffirmed its view that the effect of the reservation of common fishing rights to the Indians amounted to a servitude.  Id., at 199, 39 S.Ct., at 205.\n\n\n5\n The treaty right was repeatedly referred to in Puyallup I as a \"right to fish.\"  This phrase was used no less than seven times in the course of the opinion, with no distinction being made between the right \"to fish\" and the right \"of taking fish.\"  391 U.S., at 397-399, 88 S.Ct., at 1728-1729.\n\n\n6\n Having decided that some regulation was required, but that the treaty forbade the State to choose to regulate only Indian fishing for conservation purposes, we remanded for an apportionment between net fishing and sport fishing.  Puyallup Tribe v. Washington Game Dept., 433 U.S. 165, 97 S.Ct. 2616, 53 L.Ed.2d 667 (1977) (Puyallup III ), is of little assistance in deciding the issue in the present cases.  The Court in that case decided only that the regulations permitted in Puyallup I could be applied against Indian fishing on the reservations, as well as off them.\n\n\n7\n Because it is admitted that the Indians at all times have taken substantial numbers of fish at their traditional fishing places, I do not consider whether a monopolization of all of the fish by the non-Indians would violate the spirit of the Indians' treaty right of access.  Of course, if state conservation regulations were to operate discriminatorily to deny fish to Indians, the Court's decision in Puyallup II would apply.\n\n\n8\n The Court apparently sees this windfall as being necessary for the Indians, for it concludes that \"in light of the far superior numbers, capital resources, and technology of the non-Indians, the concept of the Indians' 'equal opportunity ' to take advantage of a scarce resource is likely in practice to mean that the Indians' 'right of taking fish' will net them virtually no catch at all.\"  Ante, at 677 n. 22.  But if the situation of the Indians in the Pacific Northwest requires that special provisions be made for their livelihood, this Court should not enact these provisions by reforming a bargain struck more than 100 years ago.  Nor should the cost of compensating for any disadvantage the Indians may suffer, or have suffered, be borne solely by the commercial fishermen of the State of Washington\u2014a fraction of the people who have benefited from the population imbalance.  This is a problem for resolution by Congress.  It has the basic responsibility for making sure that Indians are not discriminated against, and that their rights are fully protected. In the exercise of this responsibility, Congress could pursue various avenues for relief of any perceived discrimination or disadvantage.  It could, for example, provide for Indian fishermen the modern technology and capital resources that they lack, thereby enabling them to compete on an equal basis with non-Indian fishermen.  Moreover, a legislation of this problem can protect the interests of Indians without imposing substantially the entire cost upon non-Indian fishermen of the State of Washington.\n\n\n9\n In addition to the burdens placed upon non-Indian fishermen, the Court's decision is likely to prove difficult to enforce fairly and effectively.  To date, the District Court has had to resort to the outer limits of its equitable powers in order to enforce its decree.  This has included taking over supervision of all of the commercial fishing in the Puget Sound area, ordering the creation of a telephone \"hot line\" that fishermen can use to determine when and where they may legally fish, and ordering United States Marshals to board fishing craft and inspect for violations of the court's preliminary injunction.  Indeed, in his response to the petition for certiorari in the present case, the Solicitor General set forth in some detail the extraordinary difficulty the Government has had in enforcing the District Court's decrees, saying:\n\"[T]he default of the state government has required the United States to concentrate a disproportionate amount of its limited fisheries enforcement personnel on what is essentially a local enforcement problem.  Agents of the National Marine Fisheries Service, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the United States Marshals Service, and the Coast Guard have been diverted from their regular duties to assist the district court in implementing the Indians' treaty rights.  This has resulted in a reduction in the federal fisheries services available for the rest of the country and for the enforcement of the ocean fisheries programs governed by the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976.\"  Brief for United States on Petition for Certiorari in Nos. 78-119 and 78-139, p. 20.\nThese problems, it seems to me, will be exacerbated by a formula apportionment such as that ordered by the Court.\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"341 U.S. 651\n71 S.Ct. 937\n95 L.Ed. 1253\nCOLLINS et al.v.HARDYMAN et al.\nNo. 217.\nArgued Jan. 8, 9, 1951.\nDecided June 4, 1951.\n\nMr. Aubrey N. Irwin, Glendale, Cal., for petitioners.\nMessrs. A. L. Wirin, Loren Miller, Los Angeles, Cal., for respondents.\nMr. Justice JACKSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis controversy arises under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 47(3), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 47(3), which provides civil remedies for certain conspiracies.1 A motion to dismiss the amended complaint raises the issue of its sufficiency and, of course, requires us to accept its well-pleaded facts as the hypothesis for decision.\n\n\n2\nIts essential allegations are that plaintiffs are citizens of the United States, residents of California, and members or officers of a voluntary association or political club organized for the purpose of participating in the election of officers of the United States, petitioning the national government for redress of grievances, and engaging in public meetings for the discussion of national public issues. It planned a public meeting for November 14, 1947, on the subject, 'The Cominform and the Marshall Plan,' at which it was intended to adopt a resolution opposing said Marshall Plan, to be forwarded, by way of a petition for the redress of grievances, to appropriate federal officials.\n\n\n3\nThe conspiracy charged as being within the Act is that defendants, with knowledge of the meeting and its purposes, entered into an agreement to deprive the plaintiffs, 'as citizens of the United States, of privileges and immunities, as citizens of the United States, of the rights peaceably to assemble for the purpose of discussing and communicating upon national public issues * * *.' And further, 'to deprive the plaintiffs as well as the members of said club, as citizens of the United States, of equal privileges and immunities under the laws of the United States * * *.' This is amplified by allegations that defendants knew of many public meetings in the locality, at which resolutions were adopted by groups with whose opinions defendants agreed, and with which defendants did not interfere or conspire to interfere. 'With respect to the meeting aforesaid on November 14, 1947, however, the defendants conspired to interfere with said meeting for the reason that the defendants opposed the views of the plaintiff. * * *.'\n\n\n4\nIn the effort to bring the case within the statute, the pleader also alleged that defendants conspired 'to go in disguise upon the highways' and that they did in fact go in disguise 'consisting of the unlawful and unauthorized wearing of caps of the American Legion.' The District Court disposed of this part of the complaint by holding that wearing such headgear did not constitute the disguise or concealment of identity contemplated by the Act. Plaintiffs thereupon abandoned that part of the complaint and do not here rely upon it to support their claims.\n\n\n5\nThe complaint then separately sets out the overt acts of injury and damage relied upon to meet the requirements of the Act. To carry out the conspiracy, it is alleged, defendants proceeded to the meeting place and, by force and threats of force, did assault and intimidate plaintiffs and those present at the meeting and thereby broke up the meeting, thus interfering with the right of the plaintiffs to petition the Government for redress of grievances. Both compensatory and punitive damages are demanded.\n\n\n6\nIt is averred that the cause of action arises under the statute cited and under the Constitution of the United States. But apparently the draftsman was scrupulously cautious not to allege that it arose under the Fourteenth Amendment, or that defendants had conspired to deprive plaintiffs of rights secured by that Amendment, thus seeking to avoid the effect of earlier decisions of this Court in Fourteenth Amendment cases.\n\n\n7\nThe complaint makes no claim that the conspiracy or the overt acts involved any action by state officials, or that defendants even pretended to act under color of state law. It is not shown that defendants had or claimed any protection or immunity from the law of the State, or that they in fact enjoyed such because of any act or omission by state authorities. Indeed, the trial court found that the acts alleged are punishable under the laws of California relating to disturbance of the peace, assault, and trespass, and are also civilly actionable.2\n\n\n8\nThe District Judge held that the statute does not and cannot constitutionally afford redress for invasions of civil rights at the hands of individuals, but can only be applied to injuries to civil rights by persons acting pursuant to or under color of state law.3 In reversing the District Court's dismissal of the complaint, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held otherwise, one judge dissenting.4 The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in Love v. Chandler, 124 F.2d 785, has ruled in accord with the District Judge and the dissenting Court of Appeals Judge here.5 To resolve the conflict, we granted certiorari.6\n\n\n9\nThis statutory provision has long been dormant. It was introduced into the federal statutes by the Act of April 20, 1871, entitled, 'An Act to enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and for other Purposes.'7 The Act was among the last of the reconstruction legislation to be based on the 'conquered province' theory which prevailed in Congress for a period following the Civil War. This statute, without separability provisions, established the civil liability with which we are here concerned as well as other civil liabilities, together with parallel criminal liabilities. It also provided that unlawful combinations and conspiracies named in the Act might be deemed rebellions, and authorized the President to employ the militia to suppress them. The President was also authorized to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. It prohibited any person from being a federal grand or petit juror in any case arising under the Act unless he took and subscribed an oath in open court 'that he has never, directly or indirectly, counselled, advised, or voluntarily aided any such combination or conspiracy'. Heavy penalties and liabilities were laid upon any person who, with knowledge of such conspiracies, aided them or failed to do what he could to suppress them.\n\n\n10\nThe Act, popularly known as the Ku Klux Act, was passed by a partisan vote in a highly inflamed atmosphere. It was preceded by spirited debate which pointed out its grave character and susceptibility to abuse, and its defects were soon realized when its execution brought about a severe reaction.8\n\n\n11\nThe provision establishing criminal conspiracies in language indistinguishable from that used to describe civil conspiracies came to judgment in United States v. Harris, 106 U.S. 629, 1 S.Ct. 601, 27 L.Ed. 290.9 It was held unconstitutional. This decision was in harmony with that of other important decisions during that period10 by a Court, every member of which had been appointed by President Lincoln, Grant, Hayes, Garfield or Arthur\u2014all indoctrinated in the cause which produced the Fourteenth Amendment, but convinced that it was not to be used to centralize power so as to upset the federal system.\n\n\n12\nWhile we have not been in agreement as to the interpretation and application of some of the post-Civil War legislation,11 the Court recently unanimously declared, through the Chief Justice:\n\n\n13\n'Since the decision of this Court in the Civil Rights Cases, 1883, 109 U.S. 3, 3 S.Ct. 18, 27 L.Ed. 835, the principle has become firmly embedded in our constitutional law that the action inhibited by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States. That Amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful.'12\n\n\n14\nAnd Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting, has quoted with approval from the Cruikshank case, \"The fourteenth amendment prohibits a State from denying to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws; but this provision does not, any more than the one which precedes it * * * add anything to the rights which one citizen has under the Constitution against another.' 92 U.S. (at) p(ages) 554\u2014555, 23 L.Ed. 588.' And \"The only obligation resting upon the United States is to see that the States do not deny the right. This the amendment guarantees, but no more. The power of the national government is limited to the enforcement of this guaranty.\" He summed up: 'The Fourteenth Amendment protects the individual against state action, not against wrongs done by individuals. * * *'13\n\n\n15\nIt is apparent that, if this complaint meets the requirements of this Act, it raises constitutional problems of the first magnitude that, in the light of history, are not without difficulty. These would include issues as to congressional power under and apart from the Fourteenth Amendment, the reserved power of the States, the content of rights derived from national as distinguished from state citizenship, and the question of separability of the Act in its application to those two classes of rights. The latter question was long ago decided adversely to the plaintiffs. Baldwin v. Franks, 120 U.S. 678, 7 S.Ct. 763, 32 L.Ed. 766. Before we embark upon such a constitutional inquiry, it is necessary to satisfy ourselves that the attempt to allege a cause of action within the purview of the statute has been successful.\n\n\n16\nThe section under which this action is brought falls into two divisions. The forepart defines conspiracies that may become the basis of liability, and the latter portion defines overt acts necessary to consummate the conspiracy as an actionable wrong. While a mere unlawful agreement or conspiracy may be made a federal crime, as it was at common law,14 this statute does not make the mere agreement or understanding for concerted action which constitutes the forbidden conspiracy an actionable wrong unless it matures into some action that inflicts injury. That, we think, is the significance of the second division of the section.\n\n\n17\nThe provision with reference to the overt act will bear repeating, with emphasis supplied: '* * * (I)n any case of conspiracy set forth in this section, if one or more persons engaged therein do, or cause to be done, any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or property, or deprived of having and exercising any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States, the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages * * *.'\n\n\n18\nIn the light of the dictum in United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 552, 23 L.Ed. 588, we assume, without deciding, that the facts pleaded show that defendants did deprive plaintiffs 'of having and exercising' a federal right which, provided the defendants were engaged in a 'conspiracy set forth in this section,' would bring the case within the Act.\n\n\n19\nThe 'conspiracy' required is differently stated from the required overt act and we think the difference is not accidental but significant. Its essentials, with emphasis supplied, are that two or more persons must conspire (1) for the purpose of depriving any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the law; or (2) for the purpose of preventing or hindering the constituted authorities from giving or securing to all persons the equal protection of the laws; or (3) to prevent by force, intimidation, or threat, any citizen entitled to vote from giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner toward election of an elector for President or a member of Congress; or (4) to injure any citizen in person or property on account of such support or advocacy. There is no claim that any allegation brings this case within the provisions that we have numbered (2), (3), and (4), so we may eliminate any consideration of those categories. The complaint is within the statute only if it alleges a conspiracy of the first described class. It is apparent that this part of the Act defines conspiracies of a very limited character. They must, we repeat, be 'for the purpose of depriving * * * of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws'. (Italics supplied.) Passing the argument, fully developed in the Civil Rights Cases, that an individual or group of individuals not in office cannot deprive anybody of constitutional rights, though they may invade or violate those rights, it is clear that this statute does not attempt to reach a conspiracy to deprive one of rights, unless it is a deprivation of equality, of 'equal protection of the law,' or of 'equal privileges and immunities under the law'. That accords with the purpose of the Act to put the lately freed Negro on an equal footing before the law with his former master. The Act apparently deemed that adequate and went no further.\n\n\n20\nWhat we have here is not a conspiracy to affect in any way these plaintiffs' equality of protection by the law, or their equality of privileges and immunities under the law. There is not the slightest allegation that defendants were conscious of or trying to influence the law, or were endeavoring to obstruct or interfere with it. The only inequality suggested is that the defendants broke up plaintiffs' meeting and did not break up meetings of others with whose sentiments they agreed. To be sure, this is not equal injury, but it is no more a deprivation of 'equal protection' or of 'equal privileges and immunities' than it would be for one to assault one neighbor without assaulting them all, or to libel some persons without mention of others. Such private discrimination is not inequality before the law unless there is some manipulation of the law or its agencies to give sanction or sanctuary for doing so. Plaintiffs' rights were certainly invaded, disregarded and lawlessly violated, but neither their rights nor their equality of rights under the law have been, or were intended to be, denied or impaired. Their rights under the laws and to protection of the laws remain untouched and equal to the rights of every other Californian, and may be vindicated in the same way and with the same effect as those of any other citizen who suffers violence at the hands of a mob.\n\n\n21\nWe do not say that no conspiracy by private individuals could be of such magnitude and effect as to work a deprivation of equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under laws. Indeed, the post Civil War Ku Klux Klan, against which this Act was fashioned, may have, or may reasonably have been thought to have, done so. It is estimated to have had a membership of around 550,000, and thus to have included 'nearly the entire adult male white population of the South.'15 It may well be that a conspiracy, so farflung and embracing such numbers, with a purpose to dominate and set at naught the 'carpetbag' and 'scalawag' governments of the day, was able effectively to deprive Negroes of their legal rights and to close all avenues of redress or vindication, in view of the then disparity of position, education and opportunity between them and those who made up the Ku Klux Klan. We do not know. But here nothing of that sort appears. We have a case of a lawless political brawl, precipitated by a handful of while citizens against other white citizens. California courts are open to plaintiffs and its laws offer redress for their injury and vindication for their rights.\n\n\n22\nWe say nothing of the power of Congress to authorize such civil actions as respondents have commenced or otherwise to redress such grievances as they assert. We think that Congress has not, in the narrow class of conspiracies defined by this statute, included the conspiracy charged here. We therefore reach no constitutional questions. The facts alleged fall short of a conspiracy to alter, impair or deny equality of rights under the law, though they do show a lawless invasion of rights for which there are remedies in the law of California. It is not for this Court to compete with Congress or attempt to replace it as the Nation's law-making body.\n\n\n23\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\n\n\n24\nReversed.\n\n\n25\nMr. Justice BURTON, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS concur, dissenting.\n\n\n26\nI cannot agree that the respondents in their complaint have failed to state a cause of action under R.S. \u00a7 1980(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 47(3), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 47(3).\n\n\n27\nThe right alleged to have been violated is the right to petition the Federal Government for a redress of grievances. This right is expressly recognized by the First Amendment and this Court has said that 'The very idea of a government, republican in form, implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances.' United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 552, 23 L.Ed. 588, and see In re Quarles and Butler, 158 U.S. 532, 535, 15 S.Ct. 959, 960, 39 L.Ed. 1080. The source of the right in this case is not the Fourteenth Amendment. The complaint alleges that petitioners 'knowingly' did not interfere with the 'many public meetings' whose objectives they agreed with, but that they did conspire to break up respondents' meeting because petitioners were opposed to respondents' views, which were expected to be there expressed. Such conduct does not differ materially from the specific conspiracies which the Court recognizes that the statute was intended to reach.\n\n\n28\nThe language of the statute refutes the suggestion that action under color of state law is a necessary ingredient of the cause of action which it recognizes. R.S. \u00a7 1980(3) speaks of 'two or more persons in any State or Territory' conspiring. That clause is not limited to state officials. Still more obviously, where the section speaks of persons going 'in disguise on the highway * * * for the purpose of depriving * * * any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws,' it certainly does not limit its reference to actions of that kind by state officials. When Congress, at this period, did intend to limit comparable civil rights legislation to action under color of state law, it said so in unmistakable terms. In fact, R.S. \u00a7 1980(3) originally was \u00a7 2 of the Act of April 20, 1871, and \u00a7 1 of that same Act said 'That any person who, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State, shall subject * * * any person within the jurisdiction of the United States to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States, shall * * * be liable to the party injured * * *.' (Emphasis added.) 17 Stat. 13.\n\n\n29\nCongress certainly has the power to create a federal cause of action in favor of persons injured by private individuals through the abridgment of federally created constitutional rights. It seems to me that Congress has done just this in R.S. \u00a7 1980(3). This is not inconsistent with the principle underlying the Fourteenth Amendment. That amendment prohibits the respective states from making laws abridging the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States or denying to any person within the jurisdiction of a state the equal protection of the laws. Cases holding that those clauses are directed only at state action are not authority for the contention that Congress may not pass laws supporting rights which exist apart from the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n30\nAccordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n\n1\n 17 Stat. 13, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 47(3), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 47(3) reads:\n'If two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire or go in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another, for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws; or for the purpose of preventing or hindering the constituted authorities of any State or Territory from giving or securing to all persons within such State or Territory the equal protection of the laws; or if two or more persons conspire to prevent by force, intimidation, or threat, any\ncitizen who is lawfully entitled to vote, from giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner, toward or in favor of the election of any lawfully qualified person as an elector for President or Vice President, or as a Member of Congress of the United States; or to injure any citizen in person or property on account of such support or advocacy; in any case of conspiracy set forth in this section, if one or more persons engaged therein do, or cause to be done, any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or property, or deprived of having and exercising any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States, the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages, occasioned by such injury or deprivation, against any one or more of the conspirators.'\nThis paragraph should be read in the context of other paragraphs of the same section, and note should also be taken of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 43, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 43, which reads:\n'Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.'\n\n\n2\n The opinion of District Judge Yankwich for this cites in his notes, 80 F.Supp. 501, 510:\n'39. Cal.Penal Code, Section 415 (disturbance of the peace of neighborhood or person) Section 403 (disturbance of public meetings).\n'40.

{"text":"385 U.S. 214\n87 S.Ct. 473\n17 L.Ed.2d 318\nIMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE, Petitioner,v.Giuseppe ERRICO.  Muriel May SCOTT, nee Plummer, Petitioner,  v.  IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE.\nNos. 54 and 91.\nArgued Oct. 20, 1966.\nDecided Dec. 12, 1966.\n\nSol. Gen., Thurgood Marshall, for Immigration and Naturalization service.\nFrank M. Ierulli, Portland, Or., for Giuseppe Errico.\nJulius C. Biervliet, Mount Vernon, N.Y., for Muriel May Scott.\nMr. Cheif Justice WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nWe granted certiorari in these cases to resolve a conflict between the Second and Ninth Circuits on their interpretations of \u00a7 241(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.1 The issue is identical in both cases and, therefore, lends itself to a single opinion.\n\nSection 241(f) reads as follows:\n\n2\n'The provisions of this section relating to the deportation      of aliens within the United States on the ground that they      were excludable at the time of entry as aliens who have      sought to procure, or have procured visas or other      documentation, or entry into the United States by fraud or      misrepresentation shall not apply to an alien otherwise      admissible at the time of entry who is the spouse, parent, or      a child of a United States citizens or of an alien lawfully      admitted for permanent residence.'\n\n\n3\nThe issue is whether the statute saves from deportation an alien who misrepresents his status for the purpose of evading quota restrictions, if he has the necessary familial relationship to a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident.\n\n\n4\nRespondent Errico in No. 54, a native of Italy, falsely represented to the immigration authorities that he was a skilled mechanic with specialized experience in repairing foreign automobiles. On the basis of that misrepresentation he was granted first preference quota status under the statutory preference scheme then in effect, and entered the United States in 1959 with his wife. A child was born to the couple in 1960 and acquired United States citizenship at birth. In 1963 deportation proceedings were commenced against Errico on the ground that he was excludable at the time of entry as not 'of the proper status under the quota specified in the immigrant visa.'2 Throughout the proceedings Errico insisted that he was saved from deportation by \u00a7 241(f). The special inquiry officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled that relief under \u00a7 241(f) was not available because Errico had not complied with quota requirements and, hence, was not 'otherwise admissible at the time of entry.' The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the deportation order but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the construction of the statute adopted by the Board would strip it of practically all meaning, since a material misrepresentation would presumably be given to conceal some factor that would bear on admissibility. 349 F.2d 541. We granted certiorari. 383 U.S. 941, 86 S.Ct. 1196, 16 L.Ed.2d 205.\n\n\n5\nPetitioner Scott in No. 91, a native of Jamaica, contracted a marriage with a United States citizen by proxy solely for the purpose of obtaining nonquota status for entry into the country. She has never lived with her husband and never intended to do so. After entering the United States in 1958, she gave birth to an illegitimate child, who became an American citizen at birth. When the fraud was discovered, deportation proceedings were begun, and a special inquiry officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service found her deportable on the ground that she was not a nonquota immigrant as specified in her visa.3 The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the Board. 350 F.2d 279. The court agreed with the Board of Immigration Appeals that a sham marriage contracted solely to circumvent the immigration laws would not confer nonquota status on an alien as the spouse of an American citizen. It also affirmed the ruling that Mrs. Scott was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 241(f) because she was not otherwise admissible at the time of entry, since her country's quota was oversubscribed. We granted certiorari. 383 U.S. 941, 86 S.Ct. 1211, 16 L.Ed.2d 206.\n\n\n6\nAt the outset it should be noted that even the Government agrees that \u00a7 241(f) cannot be applied with strict literalness. Literally, \u00a7 241(f) applies only when the alien is charged with entering in violation of \u00a7 212(a)(19) of the statute, which excludes from entry '(a)ny alien who * * * has procured a visa or other documentation * * * by fraud, or by willfully misrepresenting a material fact.'4 Under this interpretation, an alien who entered by fraud could be deported for having entered with a defective visa or for other documentary irregularities even if he would have been admissible if he had not committed the fraud. The Government concedes that such an interpretation would be inconsistent with the manifest purpose of the section, and the administrative authorities have consistently held that \u00a7 241(f) waives any deportation charge that results directly from the misrepresentation regardless of the section of the statute under which the charge was brought, provided that the alien was 'otherwise admissible at the time of entry.'5 The Government's argument in both cases is that to be otherwise admissible at the time of entry the alien must show that he would have been admitted even if he had not lied, and that the aliens in these cases would not have been admitted because of the quota restrictions. It is the argument of the aliens that our adoption of the government thesis would negate the intention of Congress to apply fair humanitarian standards in granting relief from the consequences of their fraud to aliens who are close relatives of United States citizens, and that the statute would have practically no effect if construed as the Government argues, since it requires a considerable stretch of the imagination to conceive of an alien making a material misrepresentation that did not conceal some factor that would make him inadmissible.\n\n\n7\nThe sharp divergence of opinion among the circuit judges in these cases indicates that the meaning of the words 'otherwise admissible' is not obvious. An interpretation of these words requires close attention to the language of \u00a7 241(f), to the language of its predecessor, \u00a7 7 of the 1957 Act,6 and to the legislative history of these provisions.\n\n\n8\nThe legislative history begins with the enactment of the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, 62 Stat. 1009. This Act provided for the admission to the United States of thousands of war refugess, many from countries that had fallen behind the Iron Curtain. Some of these refugees misrepresented their nationality or homeland while in Europe to avoid being repatriated to a Communist country. In so doing, however, they fell afoul of \u00a7 10 of the Act, which provided that persons making willful misrepresentations for the purpose of gaining admission 'shall thereafter not be admissible into the United States.' The plight of these refugees, who were excluded from the United States for misrepresentations that were generally felt to be justifiable, inspired recurring proposals for statutory reform. When the Act was revised and codified in 1952, the House Committee recommended adding a provision to save such refugees from deportation when they had misrepresented their nationality or homeland only to avoid repatriation and persecution.7 The Conference Committee deleted the provision, but announced its sympathy with the refugees in the following terms:\n\n\n9\n'It is also the opinion of the conferees that the sections of      the bill which provide for the exclusion of aliens who obtained travel documents by fraud or by      willfully misrepresenting a material fact, should not serve      to exclude or to deport certain bona fide refugees who in      fear of being forcibly repatriated to their former homelands      misrepresented their place of birth when applying for a visa      and such misrepresentation did not have as its basis the      desire to evade the quota provisions of the law or an      investigation in the place of their former residence. The      conferees wish to emphasize that in applying fair      humanitarian standards in the administrative adjudication of      such cases, every effort is to be made to prevent the evasion      of law by fraud and to protect the interest of the United      States.' H.R.Rep.No.2096, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 128 (1952),      U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1952, p. 1754.\n\n\n10\nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Attorney General did not construe the statute as the Conference Committee had recommended, believing that the explicit statutory language did not allow for an exemption for justifiable misrepresentations. Refugees who misrepresented their place of origin were always found to have concealed a material fact, since the misrepresentation hindered an investigation of their background.8\n\n\n11\nThe misrepresentation section was not the only provision of the 1952 legislation that was widely thought to be unnecessarily harsh and restrictive, and in 1957 Congress passed legislation alleviating in many respects the stricter provisions of the earlier legislation. The purpose of the 1957 Act is perfectly clear from its terms, as well as from the relevant House and Senate Committee Reports.9 The most important provisions of the Act provide for special nonquota status for the adopted children or illegitimate children of immigrant parents, and for orphans who have been or are to be adopted by United States citizens. Other important provisions allow the Attorney General to waive certain grounds for exclusion or deportation, including affliction with tuberculosis or conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, on behalf of aliens who are near relatives of United States citizens or of aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The intent of the Act is plainly to grant exceptions to the rigorous provisions of the 1952 Act for the purpose of keeping family units together. Congress felt that, in many circumstances, it was more important to unite families and preserve family ties than it was to enforce strictly the quota limitations or even the many restrictive sections that are designed to keep undesirable or harmful aliens out of the country.10\n\n\n12\nIn this context it is not surprising that Congress also granted relief to aliens facing exclusion or deportation because they has gained entry through misrepresentation. Section 7 of the 1957 Act provided that:\n\n\n13\n'The provisions of section 241 of the Immigration and      Nationality Act relating to the deportation of aliens within      the United States on the ground that they were excludable at      the time of entry as (1) aliens who have sought to procure,      or have procured visas or other documentation, or entry into      the United States by fraud or misrepresentation, or (2)      aliens who were not of the nationality specified in their      visas, shall not apply to an alien otherwise admissible at      the time of entry who (A) is the spouse, parent, or a child      of a United States citizen or of an alien lawfully admitted      for permanent residence; or (B) was admitted to the United      States between December 22, 1945, and November 1, 1954, both      dates inclusive, and misrepresented his nationality, place of      birth, identity, or residence in applying for a visa:      Provided, That such alien described in clause (B) shall      establish to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that      the misrepresentation was predicated upon the alien's fear of      persecution because of race, religion, or political opinion      if repatriated to his former home or residence, and was not      committed for the purpose of evading the quota restrictions      of the immigration laws or an investigation of the alien at      the place of his former home, or residence, or elsewhere.      After the effective date of this Act, any alien who is the      spouse, parent, or a child of a United States citizen or of      an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence and who is      excludable because (1) he seeks, has sought to procure, or      has procured, a visa or other documentation, or entry into      the United States, by fraud or misrepresentation, or (2) he      admits the commission of perjury in connection therewith, shall hereafter be granted a      visa and admitted to the United States for permanent      residence, if otherwise admissible, if the Attorney General      in his discretion has consented to the alien's applying or      reapplying for a visa and for admission to the United      States.'\n\n\n14\nThis section waived deportation under certain circumstances for two classes of aliens who had entered by fraud or misrepresentation. First, an alien who was 'the spouse, parent, or a child of a United States citizen * * *' was saved from deportation for his fraud if he was 'otherwise admissible at the time of entry.' Second, an alien who entered during the postwar period and misrepresented his nationality, place of birth, identity, or residence was saved from deportation if he was 'otherwise admissible at the time of entry' and if he could\n\n\n15\n'establish to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that      the misrepresentation was predicated upon the alien's fear of      persecution because of race, religion, or political opinion      if repatriated to his former home or residence, and was not      committed for the purpose of evading the quota restrictions      of the immigration laws or an investigation of the alien at      the place of his former home, or residence, or elsewhere.'\n\n\n16\nThis language would be meaningless if an alien who committed fraud for the purpose of evading quota restrictions would be deportable as not 'otherwise admissible at the time of entry.' Congress must have felt that aliens who evaded quota restrictions by fraud would be 'otherwise admissible at the time of entry' or it would not have found it necessary to provide further that, in the case of an alien not possessing a close familial relationship to a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident, the fraud must not be for the purpose of evading quota restrictions.\n\n\n17\nThis conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Congress further specified that the aliens who were not close relatives of United States citizens must establish that their fraud was not committed for the purpose of evading an investigation. Fraud for the purpose of evading an investigation, if forgiven by the statute, would clearly leave the alien 'otherwise admissible' if there were no other disqualifying factor. Elementary principles of statutory construction lead to the conclusion that Congress meant to specify two specific types of fraud that would leave an alien 'otherwise admissible' but that would nonetheless bar relief to those aliens who could not claim close relationship with a United States citizen or alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\n\n\n18\nThe present \u00a7 241(f) is essentially a re-enactment of \u00a7 7 of the 1957 Act. The legislative history leaves no doubt that no substantive change in the section was intended.11 The provision dealing with aliens who had entered the United States between 1945 and 1954, and had misrepresented their nationality for fear of persecution or repatriation, was omitted because it had accomplished its purpose; the rest of the section was retained intact.12 It could hardly be argued that Congress intended to change the construction of the statute by this codification.\n\n\n19\nThe intent of \u00a7 7 of the 1957 Act not to require that aliens who are close relatives of United States citizens have complied with quota restrictions to escape deportation for their fraud is clear from its language, and there is nothing in the legislative history to suggest that Congress had in mind a contrary result. The only specific reference to the part of \u00a7 7 that deals with close relatives of United States citizens or residents is in the House Committee Report, and it says only that most of the persons eligible for relief would be\n\n\n20\n'Mexican nationals, who, during the time when border-control      operations suffered from regrettable laxity, were able to      enter the United States, establish a family in this country,      and were subsequently found to reside in the United States      illegally.' H.R.Rep.No.1199, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 11,      U.S.Code Cong., & Admin. News 1957, p. 2024.\n\n\n21\nWithout doubt most of the aliens who had obtained entry into the United States by illegal means were Mexicans, because it has always been far easier to avoid border restrictions when entering from Mexico than when entering from countries that do not have a common land border with the United States. There is nothing in the Committee Report to indicate that relief under the section was intended to be restricted to Mexicans, however. Neither does it follow that, because Mexicans are not subject to quota restrictions, therefore nationals of countries that do have a quota must be within the quota to obtain relief.\n\n\n22\nThe construction of the statute that we adopt in these cases is further reinforced when the section is regarded in the context of the 1957 Act. The fundamental purpose of this legislation was to unite families. Refugees from Communist lands were also benefited, but the Act principally granted relief to persons who would be temporarily or permanently separated from their nearest relatives if the strict requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act, including the national quotas, were not relaxed for them. It was wholly consistent with this purpose of this legislation was to unite immigrants who gained admission by misrepresentation, perhaps many years ago, should not be deported because their countries' quotas were oversubscribed when they entered if the effect of deportation would be to separate families composed in part of American citizens or lawful permanent residents.\n\n\n23\nEven if there were some doubt as to the correct construction of the statute, the doubt should be resolved in favor of the alien. As this Court has held, even where a punitive section is being construed:\n\n\n24\n'We resolve the doubts in favor of that construction because      deportation is a drastic measure and at times the equivalent      of banishment or exile, Delgadillo v. Carmishael, 332 U.S.      388, 68 S.Ct. 10, 92 L.Ed. 17. It is the forfeiture for      misconduct of a residence in this country. Such a forfeiture      is a penalty To construe this statutory provision less      generously to the alien might find support in logic. But      since the stakes are considerable for the individual, we will      not assume that Congress meant to trench on his freedome      beyond that which is required by the narrowest of several      possible meanings of the words used.' Fong Haw Tan v. Phelan,      333 U.S. 6, 10, 68 S.Ct. 374, 376, 92 L.Ed. 433.\n\n\n25\nSee also Barber v. Gonzales, 347 U.S. 637, 642\u2014643, 74 S.Ct. 822, 825\u2014826, 98 L.Ed. 1009. The 1957 Act was not a punitive statute, and \u00a7 7 of that Act, now codified as \u00a7 241(f), in particular was designed to accomplish a humanitarian result. We conclude that to give meaning to the statute in the light of its humanitarian purpose of preventing the breaking up of families composed in part at least of American citizens, the conflict between the circuits must be resolved in favor of the aliens, and that the Errico decision must be affirmed and the Scott decision reversed.\n\n\n26\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n27\nCase No. 54 affirmed.\n\n\n28\nCase No. 91 reversed.\n\n\n29\nMr. Justice STEWART, with whom Mr. Justice HARLAN and Mr. Justice WHITE join, dissenting.\n\n\n30\nThe facts in one of these cases (No. 91) vividly illustrate the effect of the Court's interpretation of \u00a7 241(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The petitioner, a resident of Jamaica, paid for a sham marriage with an American citizen. A ceremony was held, but the petitioner and her 'husband' parted immediately and have not seen each other since. However, the pretended marriage served its purpose; the petitioner was admitted into this country as a nonquota immigrant upon her false representation that she was the wife of a United States citizen. After this fraudulent entry she managed to become the actual parent of a United States citizen by conceiving and bearing an illegitimate child here.\n\n\n31\nThe Court holds that this unsavory series of events gives the petitioner an unqualified right under \u00a7 241(f) to remain in this country ahead of all the honest people waiting in Jamaica and elsewhere to gain lawful entry.1 I can find no support in the statute for such an odd and inequitable result.\n\nSection 241(f) provides as follows:\n\n32\n'The provisions of this section relating to the deportation      of aliens within the United States on the ground that they      were excludable at the time of entry as aliens who have      sought to procure, or have procured visas or other      documentation, or entry into the United States by fraud or      misrepresentation shall not apply to an alien otherwise      admissible at the time of entry who is the spouse, parent, or      a child of a United States citizen or of an alien lawfully      admitted for permanent residence.'\n\n\n33\nIt seems clear to me, for two separate and independently sufficient reasons, that this statute does not operate to bar the deportation of the aliens in the cases now before us. In the first place, \u00a7 241(f) has application only to the deportation provisions which are based upon fraudulent entry, and the aliens in these two cases were not ordered to be deported under those provisions. Secondly, even if it were generally applicable, \u00a7 241(f) does not cover the aliens involved in these two cases, because neither of them was 'otherwise admissible' at the time of entry.\n\nI.\n\n34\nSection 241(f) by its terms neutralizes only those 'provisions * * * relating to the deportation of aliens within the United States on the ground that they * * * sought to procure * * * entry into the United States by fraud or misrepresentation * * *.' Although the aliens in these two cases could have been deported under those 'provisions,' the deportation proceedings in both cases were in fact brought on grounds unrelated to their procurement of fraudulent visas. Both aliens were ordered to be deported, not because of their fraud, but because they were not properly within their countries' quotas.\n\n\n35\nThe plain terms of \u00a7 241(f), therefore, do not even potentially apply to these aliens.2 To hold that \u00a7 241(f) is relevant to these cases is tantamount to holding that it is applicable to bar deportation based on any ground at all so long as the alien lied about that ground at the time of his unlawful entry.3 I think nothing could be further from the statutory language or the congressional purpose.\n\nII.\n\n36\nBut even if \u00a7 241(f) were generally applicable, these aliens could not claim its benefits because they were not within their respective national immigration quotas and therefore were not 'otherwise admissible' at the time they entered the United States. That is the clear import of the statutory qualification, if its words are to be taken at their face value. That, too, has been the uniform and consistent administrative construction of the statute. See Matter of D'O\u2014, 8 I. & N. Dec. 215 (1958); Matter of Slade, 10 I. & N. Dec. 128 (1962).\n\n\n37\nTo except quota requirements of admissibility from the statutory qualification of 'otherwise admissible' would undercut the elaborate quota system which was for years at the heart of the immigration laws. Yet the legislative history of the predecessor of \u00a7 241(f), \u00a7 7 of the 1957 Act, makes clear that the limited relief given by the statute was to have no effect at all on the quota system.4\n\n\n38\nMoreover, the consistent use of the same qualifying phrase, 'otherwise admissible' in other sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act makes clear that, as a term of art, it includes quota admissibility. The term typically follows a definition of grounds for admissibility or for exceptions to deportation, to insure that all the other relevant requirements of the Act are imposed upon the alien.5\n\n\n39\nThus the plain meaning of the 'otherwise admissible' qualification, as well as legislative policy and legislative history, all indicate that the term serves the same basic function in \u00a7 241(f) as in other sections of the Act. Fraud is removed as a ground for deportation of those with the requisite family ties, and 'otherwise admissible' insures the integrity of the remainder of the statutory scheme.6\n\n\n40\nThe Court justifies its disregard of the plain meaning and consistent administrative construction of \u00a7 241(f) by resort to the spirit of humanitarianism which is said to have moved Congress to enact the statute. No doubt Congress in 1957 was concerned with giving relief to some aliens who had entered this country by illegal means and established families here. But the people who were to benefit from this genuine human concern were those from countries like Mexico, which had no quota restrictions, and those who had misrepresented their national origins in order to avoid repatriation to Iron Curtain countries. There is nothing to indicate that Congress enacted this legislation to allow wholesale evasion of the Immigration and Nationality Act or as a general reward for fraud.\n\n\n41\nI respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n 75 Stat. 655 (1961), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(f).\n\n\n2\n Section 211(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 181 (1952), later amended, 79 Stat. 917 (1965), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1181(a) (1964 ed., Supp. I).

(1957).\n\n\n10\n It is in this context that the legislative history cited in the dissent should be understood. The remarks of Senator Eastland and Congressman Celler quoted in footnote 4 of the dissent in context do not refer to \u00a7 7 of the Act but to the provisions of the bill providing for the adoption of alien orphans. Furthermore, Senator Eastland and Congressman Celler did not mean that no exceptions to the quota requirements were intended to be created, because the basic purpose of the bill was to relax the quota system for adopted children and for certain other classes of aliens deemed deserving of relief. They were reassuring their colleagues that no fundamental changes in the quota system were contemplated.\n\n\n11\n H.R.Rep. No. 1086, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 37 (1961), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1961, p. 2950. See also 107 Cong.Rec. 19653\u201419654 (1961) (remarks of Senator Eastland).\n\n\n12\n H.R.Rep. No. 1086, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 37 (1961).\n\n\n1\n When 'Mrs. Scott' made her fraudulent entry in 1958, Jamaica had an annual quota of 100 immigrants and a waiting list of 21,759 hopeful applicants. The corresponding figures for Italy in 1959, the year of Mr. Errico's entry, were 5,666 and 162,612.\n\n\n2\n The Court states that the Government 'concedes' and that 'administrative authorities have consistently held that \u00a7 241(f) waives any deportation charge that results directly from the misrepresentation.' Ante, at p. 217. But this concession and administrative practice fall far short of covering these cases. For here the grounds for deportation did not '(result) directly from the misrepresentation.' They antedated and were the reason for the misrepresentation. The 'administrative authorities' cited by the Court turned upon this distinction. In Matter of Y\u2014-, 8 I. & N.Dec. 143 (1959), for example, the Board of Immigration Appeals broadened \u00a7 241(f) enough to cover fraud-related administrative procedural defects in the alien's entry. It is this construction of \u00a7 241(f) which the Government concedes, not the Court's construction which broadens the statute to excuse all disqualifications for entry.\n\n\n3\n Thus, a Communist who had lied to the immigration authorities about his party membership at the time of entry could invoke \u00a7 241(f) and remain in this country, while one who had told the truth, but was admitted by virtue of an administrative error, could be deported. See \u00a7 212(a)(28), Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\n\n4\n Senator Eastland, Chairman of the Committee which sponsored the 1957 amendments to the Immigration Act, stated, 'the bill does not modify the national origins quota provisions.' 103 Cong.Rec. 15487 (Aug. 21, 1957). See also 103 Cong.Rec. 16300 (Aug. 28, 1957) (remarks of Congressman Celler), '(The bill) makes no changes\u2014no changes whatsoever, in the controversial issue of the national origins quota system.'\nPub.L. 89\u2014236, 79 Stat. 911, made substantial changes in the quota system. But that statute, passed in 1965, hardly indicates a congressional intent in 1957 or in 1961 (when the present statute was revised) to abandon quota requirements.\n\n\n5\n See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 211(a) and (b): The War Brides Act, 59 Stat. 659.\n\n\n6\n Under \u00a7 7 of the 1957 Act certain aliens had to establish both that they were 'otherwise admissible' and that they had not lied to evade quota restrictions. The Court reasons from this that quota restrictions are not embodied in the 'otherwise admissible' qualification. But this reasoning is inconsistent with the Court's conclusion concerning the general applicability of \u00a7 241(f), discussed in Part I of this dissent.\nSection 7 of the earlier Act provided as follows:\n'The provisions of section 241 of the Immigration and Nationality Act relating to the deportation of aliens within the United States on the ground that they were excludable at the time of entry as (1) aliens who have sought to procure, or have procured visas or other documentation, or entry into the United States by fraud or misrepresentation, or (2) aliens who were not of the nationality specified in their visas, shall not apply to an alien otherwise admissible at the time of entry who * * *.' (Emphasis supplied.)\nIf the present meaning of 'otherwise admissible' is to be determined by the 1957 Act, so then must other parts of the statute be similarly determined. Section 241(f) begins with words almost identical to those quoted above. But the second ground of applicability\u2014to 'aliens who were not of the nationality specified in ther visas'\u2014is omitted. Thus, lies about nationality were not forgiven by the first part of the 1957 Act and are not, by the Court's reasoning, excused by \u00a7 241(f), the successor statute. And since there is nothing to distinguish lies about nationality that avoid quota restrictions from other lies with the same effect, the reasoning that leads to the Court's conclusion that the aliens were 'otherwise admissible' leads also to the conclusion that \u00a7 241(f) is not applicable at all in these cases.\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"450 U.S. 221\n101 S.Ct. 1074\n67 L.Ed.2d 186\nRichard SCHWEIKER, Secretary of Health and Human  Services, Appellant,v.Charles Edward WILSON et al.\nNo. 79-1380.\nArgued Dec. 2, 1980.\nDecided March 4, 1981.\n\n\nSyllabus\n\nThe Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, which is part of the Social Security Act, provides a subsistence allowance to needy aged, blind, and disabled persons.  Inmates of public institutions are generally excluded from this program, except that under \u00a7 1611(e)(1)(B) of the Act a reduced amount of SSI benefits are provided to otherwise eligible persons in a hospital, extended care facility, nursing home, or intermediate care facility receiving Medicaid funds for their care.  Appellees, aged 21 through 64 and residing in public mental institutions that do not receive Medicaid funds for their care, brought a class action in Federal District Court challenging their exclusion from the reduced SSI benefits.  The District Court held such exclusion unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection guarantees of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment on the ground that the \"mental health\" classification could not withstand judicial scrutiny because it did not have a \"substantial relation\" to the object of the legislation in light of its \"primary purpose.\"\nHeld :  Appellees' rights to equal protection were not violated by denying them SSI benefits.  Pp. 230-239.\n(a) In \u00a7 1611(e)(1)(B), Congress made a distinction not between the mentally ill and a group composed of nonmentally ill, but between residents in public institutions receiving Medicaid funds for their care and residents in such institutions not receiving such funds.  To the extent that the statute has an indirect impact upon the mentally ill as a subset of publicly institutionalized persons, the record in this case presents no statistical support for a contention that the mentally ill as a class are burdened disproportionately to any other class affected by the classification.  The indirect deprivation worked by this legislation upon appellees' class, whether or not the class is considered \"suspect,\" does not, in the absence of any evidence that Congress deliberately intended to discriminate against the mentally ill, move this Court to regard it with a heightened scrutiny.  Pp. 230-234.\n(b) The classification employed in \u00a7 1611(e)(1)(B) is to be judged under the rational-basis standard, which does not allow this Court to substitute its personal notions of good public policy for those of Congress.  Under this standard, and based on the legislative history, it was not irrational for Congress to elect, in view of budgetary constraints, to shoulder only part of the burden of supplying a \"comfort money\" allowance, leaving the States with the primary responsibility for making such an allowance available to those residents in state-run institutions, and to decide that it is the Medicaid recipients in public institutions who are the most needy and deserving of the SSI benefits.  Pp. 234-239.\n478 F.Supp. 1046, reversed.\nElliott Schulder, Washington, D. C., for appellant.\nJames D. Weill, Chicago, Ill., for appellees.\nJustice BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe issue in this case is whether Congress constitutionally may decline to grant Supplemental Security Income benefits to a class of otherwise eligible individuals who are excluded because they are aged 21 through 64 and are institutionalized in public mental institutions that do not receive Medicaid funds for their care.  The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois held unconstitutional, under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, that portion of the Social Security Act, as amended, that excludes these otherwise eligible persons from the supplemental benefits.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services has taken a direct appeal to this Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.\n\n\n2\n* In October 1972, Congress amended the Social Security Act (Act) to create the federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, effective January 1, 1974.  86 Stat. 1465, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 et seq.  This program was intended \"[t]o assist those who cannot work because of age, blindness, or disability,\" S.Rep.No.92-1230, p. 4 (1972), by \"set[ting] a Federal guaranteed minimum income level for aged, blind, and disabled persons,\" id., at 12.1\n\n\n3\nThe SSI program provides a subsistence allowance, under federal standards, to the Nation's needy aged, blind, and disabled.2  Included within the category of \"disabled\" under the program are all those \"unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period if not less than twelve months.\"  \u00a7 1614(a)(3)(A) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(A).\n\n\n4\nAlthough the SSI program is broad in its reach, its coverage is not complete.  From its very inception, the program has excluded from eligibility anyone who is an \"inmate of a public institution.\"  \u00a7 1611(e)(1)(A) of the Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(e)(1)(A).3  Also from the program's inception, Congress has made a partial exception to this exclusion by providing a small amount of money (not exceeding $300 per year) to any otherwise eligible person in \"a hospital, extended care facility, nursing home, or intermediate care facility receiving payments (with respect to such individual or spouse) under a State plan approved under subchapter XIX [Medicaid] . . .\" \u00a7 1611(e)(1)(B), as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(e)(1)(B).4  Congress thus, while excluding generally any person residing in a public institution, explicitly has tied eligibility for a reduced amount of SSI benefits to residence in an institution receiving Medicaid benefits for the care of the eligible individual.\n\n\n5\nAppellees brought this suit to challenge this resulting detail of Congress' having conditioned the limited assistance grant on eligibility for Medicaid:  a person between the ages of 21 through 64 who resides in a public mental institution is not eligible to receive this small stipend, even though that person meets the other eligibility requirements for SSI benefits, because treatment in a public mental institution for a person in this age bracket is not funded under Medicaid.5\n\n\n6\nAppellees attack this statutory classification as violative of the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.6  Their challenge, successful in the District Court, is twofold.  First they argue that the exclusion of their class of mentally ill (and therefore disabled) persons bears no rational relationship to any legitimate objective of the SSI program.  They assert, in fact, that their class was excluded inadvertently because of its political powerlessness.  Brief for Appellees 6,32.  Second, they insist that because the statute classifies on the basis of mental illness, a factor that greatly resembles other characteristics that this Court has found inherently \"suspect\" as a means of legislative classification, special justification should be required for the congressional decision to exclude appellees.\n\nII\n\n7\nThis case has had a somewhat complex procedural history.  It initially was instituted in December 1973 as a class action for injunctive and declaratory relief to challenge the federal and Illinois assistance schemes that prevailed prior to the effective date of the SSI program.  See Wilson v. Edelman, 542 F.2d 1260, 1263-1266 (CA7 1976).  The then-existing state assistance program, for which federal funds were received, excluded from eligibility any person who was residing in a public mental or tuberculosis institution or who was confined in a penal institution.  Id., at 1263, n. 2.  The plaintiffs later amended their complaint to include a challenge to the SSI exclusion, which by then had come into effect.  Id., at 1266.  A three-judge court was convened under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2281 and 2282 (1970 ed.) (since repealed by Pub.L. 94-381, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, 90 Stat. 1119).  The case was consolidated with another that challenged the exclusion from SSI benefits of any pretrial detainee.  Relying on Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975), the court granted the Secretary's motion to dismiss both cases for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust the administrative remedies provided for by \u00a7 1631(c)(3) of the Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(c)(3).  See 542 F.2d, at 1267-1268.7\n\n\n8\nOn appeal, appellees abandoned their claims under the prior federal statutes.  Id., at 1271.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the dismissal, holding that the Secretary (then Patricia Harris) had waived any requirement of exhaustion by her submission of the case to the District Court for summary disposition.8 Id., at 1272.  Because the plaintiffs had dropped their request for injunctive relief, the case was remanded to the single-judge District Court.  Id., at 1269.  That court, on remand, certified the class9 and granted appellees' motion for summary judgment, holding that \u00a7 1382(e)'s exclusion of the class members violated the equal protection guarantee of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Sterling v. Harris, 478 F.Supp. 1046 (ND Ill.1979).10  The District Court reasoned that the statute \"creates three classifications:  (1) age, and (2) residence in a public, (3) mental health hospital.\"  Id., at 1050.  It ruled that Congress' use of the first two factors need be justified only by demonstration of their \"rational relationship\" to \"a legitimate state interest.\"  Ibid.  Under that standard, these classifications withstood scrutiny.  Congress' use, however, of a \"mental health\" classification was deemed to require a closer examination because \"mental health classifications possess the significant indicia of the suspect classifications recognized in other cases.\"  Id., at 1052.  Although recognizing that the mentally ill as a group do not demonstrate all the characteristics this Court has considered as denoting inherently suspicious classifications, such as race and national origin,11 the District Court believed that the mentally ill were \"a politically impotent, insular minority\" that \"have been subject to a 'history of unequal protection.' \"  Ibid.  The court therefore concluded that Congress could legislatively disfavor the mentally ill, as \u00a7 1611(e) did, only if the statutory classification passes an \"intermediate level of judicial scrutiny,\" id., at 1053, that is, only if the \"classification bears a substantial relation\" to the object of the legislation evaluated \"in light of the primary purpose\" of the scheme of which it is a part.  Ibid.  The court adjudged that the \"primary purpose\" of the small monthly stipend was to enable the needy to purchase comfort items not provided by the institution. Rejecting the Secretary's proposed justifications for the exclusion,12 the District Court held that the classification could not withstand scrutiny. The legislative history, it said, revealed no intent to exclude appellees' class;  the court could conceive of no \"possible unexpressed purpose for the exclusion\";  and the court reasoned that \"aged, blind and disabled inmates of all public institutions would have similar needs.\"  Ibid.  Upon the Secretary's direct appeal from this judgment, we noted probable jurisdiction.  Harris v. Wilson, 446 U.S. 964, 100 S.Ct. 2938, 64 L.Ed.2d 822 (1980).\n\nIII\nA.\n\n9\nThe equal protection obligation imposed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment is not an obligation to provide the best governance possible.  This is a necessary result of different institutional competences, and its reasons are obvious.  Unless a statute employs a classification that is inherently invidious or that impinges on fundamental rights, areas in which the judiciary then has a duty to intervene in the democratic process, this Court properly exercises only a limited review power over Congress, the appropriate representative body through which the public makes democratic choices among alternative solutions to social and economic problems.  See San Antonio School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973).  At the minimum level, this Court consistently has required that legislation classify the persons it affects in a manner rationally related to legitimate governmental objectives.  See, e. g., Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970); Mathews v. De Castro, 429 U.S. 181, 97 S.Ct. 431, 50 L.Ed.2d 389 (1976).  Appellees assert that the particular grant of federal benefits under review here, however, should \"be subjected to a heightened standard of review,\" Brief for Appellees 39, because the mentally ill \"historically have been subjected to purposeful unequal treatment;  they have been relegated to a position of political powerlessness;  and prejudice against them curtails their participation in the pluralist political system and strips them of political protection against discriminatory legislation.\" (Footnote omitted.)  Id., at 41, 93 S.Ct., at 1301.\n\n\n10\nWe have no occasion to reach this issue because we conclude that this statute does not classify directly on the basis of mental health.13  The SSI program distinguishes among three groups of persons, all of whom meet the basic eligibility requirements: persons not in a \"public institution\" may receive full benefits; persons in a \"public institution\" of a certain nature (\"hospital, extended care facility, nursing home, or intermediate care facility receiving payments (with respect to such individual or spouse ) . . . under [Medicaid] )\" (emphasis added), \u00a7 1611(e)(1)(B), may receive reduced benefits;  and persons in any other \"public institution\" may not receive any benefits.  The statute does not isolate the mentally ill or subject them, as a discrete group, to special or subordinate treatment.  At the most, this legislation incidentally denies a small monthly comfort benefit to a certain number of persons suffering from mental illness;  but in so doing it imposes equivalent deprivation on other groups who are not mentally ill, while at the same time benefiting substantial numbers of the mentally ill.\n\n\n11\nThe group thus singled out for special treatment by \u00a7 1611(e) does not entirely exclude the mentally ill.  In fact, it includes, in a sizable proportion to the total population receiving SSI benefits, large numbers of mentally ill people.14 Further, the group excluded is not congruent with appellees' class.  Among those excluded are the inmates of any other nonmedical \"public institution,\" such as a prison, other penal institution, and any other publicly funded residential program the State may operate;15  persons residing in a tuberculosis institution;  and residents of a medical institution not certified as a Medicaid provider.16  Although not by the same subsection, Congress also chose to exclude from SSI eligibility persons afflicted with alcoholism or drug addiction and not undergoing treatment, \u00a7 1611(e)(3)(A), and persons who spend more than a specified time outside the United States, \u00a7 1611(f).  See Califano v. Aznavorian, 439 U.S. 170, 99 S.Ct. 471, 58 L.Ed.2d 435 (1978) (upholding constitutionality of \u00a7 1611(f));  Califano v. Torres, 435 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 906, 55 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978) (upholding constitutionality of Congress' exclusion from SSI eligibility of residents of Puerto Rico).  Thus, in \u00a7 1611(e), Congress made a distinction not between the mentally ill and a group composed of nonmentally ill, but between residents in public institutions receiving Medicaid funds for their care and residents in such institutions not receiving Medicaid funds.\n\n\n12\nTo the extent that the statute has an indirect impact upon the mentally ill as a subset of publicly institutionalized persons, this record certainly presents no statistical support for a contention that the mentally ill as a class are burdened disproportionately to any other class affected by the classification.  The exclusion draws a line only between groups composed (in part) of mentally ill individuals:  those in public mental hospitals and those not in public mental hospitals.  These groups are shifting in population, and members of one group can, and often do, pass to the other group.17\n\n\n13\nWe also note that appellees have failed to produce any evidence that the intent of Congress was to classify on the basis of mental health.  Appellees admit that no such evidence exists;  indeed, they rely on the absence of explicit intent as proof of Congress' \"inattention\" to their needs and therefore, its prejudice against them.  Brief for Appellees 39.  As in Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U.S. 535, 92 S.Ct. 1724, 32 L.Ed.2d 285 (1972), the indirect deprivation worked by this legislation upon appellees' class, whether or not the class is considered \"suspect,\" does not without more move us to regard it with a heightened scrutiny.  Cf. Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 60 L.Ed.2d 870 (1979).\n\nB\n\n14\nThus, the pertinent inquiry is whether the classification employed in \u00a7 1611(e)(1)(B) advances legitimate legislative goals in a rational fashion.  The Court has said that, although this rational-basis standard is \"not a toothless one,\" Mathews v. Lucas, 427 U.S. 495, 510, 96 S.Ct. 2755, 2764, 49 L.Ed.2d 651 (1976), it does not allow us to substitute our personal notions of good public policy for those of Congress:\n\n\n15\n\"In the area of economics and social welfare, a State      does not violate the Equal Protection Clause [and      correspondingly the Federal Government does not violate the      equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment] merely      because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect.      If the classification has some 'reasonable basis,' it does      not offend the Constitution simply because the classification      'is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice      it results in some inequity.'  Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic      Gas Co., 220 U.S. 61, 78 [31 S.Ct. 337, 340, 55 L.Ed. 369].\"      Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S., at 485, 90 S.Ct., at 1161.\n\n\n16\nThe Court also has said:  \"This inquiry employs a relatively relaxed standard reflecting the Court's awareness that the drawing of lines that create distinctions is peculiarly a legislative task and an unavoidable one.  Perfection in making the necessary classifications is neither possible nor necessary.\"  Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 314, 96 S.Ct. 2562, 2567, 49 L.Ed.2d 520 (1976).  See also United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 101 S.Ct. 453, 66 L.Ed.2d 368 (1980).  As long as the classificatory scheme chosen by Congress rationally advances a reasonable and identifiable governmental objective, we must disregard the existence of other methods of allocation that we, as individuals, perhaps would have preferred.\n\n\n17\nWe believe that the decision to incorporate the Medicaid eligibility standards into the SSI scheme must be considered Congress' deliberate, considered choice.  The legislative record, although sparse, appears to be unequivocal.  Both House and Senate Reports on the initial SSI bill noted the exclusion in no uncertain terms.  The House Report stated:\n\n\n18\n\"People who are residents of certain public      institutions, or hospitals or nursing homes which are getting      Medicaid funds, would get benefits of up to $25 a month      (reduced by nonexcluded income).  For these people most      subsistence needs are met by the institution and full      benefits are not needed.  Some payment to these people,      though, would be needed to enable them to purchase small      comfort items not supplied by the institution.  No assistance      benefits will be paid to an individual in a penal      institution.\"  H.R.Rep. No. 92-231, p. 150 (1971), U.S.Code      Cong. & Admin.News 1972, p. 5136.\n\n\n19\nThe Senate Report followed the House's language almost identically.  See S.Rep. No. 92-1230, p. 386 (1972).  We find these passages, at the very least, to be a clear expression of Congress' understanding that the stipend grant was to be limited to a group smaller than the total population of otherwise eligible, institutionalized people.  That the bill's section-by-section analysis contained in the House Report laid out the terms of the exclusion precisely supports the conclusion that Congress was aware of who was included in that limited group.  See H.R.Rep. No. 92-231, at 334.\n\n\n20\nThe limited nature of Medicaid eligibility did not pass unnoticed by the enacting Congress.  In the same bill that established the SSI program, Congress considered, and passed, an amendment to Medicaid, providing coverage of inpatient services to a large number of the juvenile needy in public mental institutions.18  See \u00a7 1905(h) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(h); S.Rep. No. 92-1230, at 280-281;  H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 92-1605, p. 65 (1972).  Also, a Senate proposal for demonstration projects on the feasibility of extending Medicaid to cover all inpatient services provided in public mental institutions was simultaneously defeated.  See S.Rep. No. 92-1230, at 281;  H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 92-1605, at 65.  Congress was in the process of considering the wisdom of these limitations at the time it chose to incorporate them into the SSI provisions.  The decision to do so did not escape controversy.  The Committee hearings contained testimony advocating extension of both Medicaid and SSI benefits to all needy residents in public mental institutions.  See Social Security Amendments of 1971, Hearings on H.R. 1 before the Senate Committee on Finance, 92d Cong., 1st and 2d Sess., 2180, 2408-2410, 2479-2485, 3257, 3319 (1972).  This legislative history shows that Congress was aware, when it added \u00a7 1611(e) to the Act, of the limitations in the Medicaid program that would restrict eligibility for the reduced SSI benefits;  we decline to regard such deliberate action as the result of inadvertence or ignorance. See Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 8, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 2505, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980).\n\n\n21\nHaving found the adoption of the Medicaid standards intentional, we deem it logical to infer from Congress' deliberate action an intent to further the same subsidiary purpose that lies behind the Medicaid exclusion, which, as no party denies, was adopted because Congress believed the States to have a \"traditional\" responsibility to care for those institutionalized in public mental institutions.19  The Secretary, emphasizing the then-existing congressional desire to economize in the disbursement of federal funds, argues that the decision to limit distribution of the monthly stipend to inmates of public institutions who are receiving Medicaid funds \"is rationally related to the legitimate legislative desire to avoid spending federal resources on behalf of individuals whose care and treatment are being fully provided for by state and local government units\" and \"may be said to implement a congressional policy choice to provide supplemental financial assistance for only those residents of public institutions who already receive significant federal support in the form of Medicaid coverage.\" Brief for Appellant 27-28.  We cannot say that the belief that the States should continue to have the primary responsibility for making this small \"comfort money\" allowance available to those residing in state-run institutions is an irrational basis for withholding from them federal general welfare funds.20\n\n\n22\nAlthough we understand and are inclined to be sympathetic with appelle$s' and their supporting amici \u00a7 assertions as to the beneficial effects of a patient's receiving the reduced stipend, we find this a legislative, and not a legal, argument.  Congress rationally may elect to shoulder only part of the burden of supplying this allowance, and may rationally limit the grant to Medicaid recipients, for whose care the Federal Government already has assumed the major portion of the expense.21  The limited gratuity represents a partial solution to a far more general problem,22 and Congress legitimately may assume that the States would, or should, provide an equivalent, either in funds or in basic care.  See Baur v. Mathews, 578 F.2d 228, 233 (CA9 1978). This Court has granted a \"strong presumption of constitutionality\" to legislation conferring monetary benefits, Mathews v. De Castro, 429 U.S., at 185, 97 S.Ct., at 434, because it believes that Congress should have discretion in deciding how to expend necessarily limited resources.  Awarding this type of benefits inevitably involves the kind of line-drawing that will leave some comparably needy person outside the favored circle.23  We cannot say that it was irrational of Congress, in view of budgetary constraints,24 to decide that it is the Medicaid recipients in public institutions that are the most needy and the most deserving of the small monthly supplement.  See, e. g., Califano v. Boles, 443 U.S. 282, 296, 99 S.Ct. 2767, 2776, 61 L.Ed.2d 541 (1979); Califano v. Jobst, 434 U.S. 47, 53, 98 S.Ct. 95, 99, 54 L.Ed.2d 228 (1977);  Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 768-770, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2468-69, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975);  Richardson v. Belcher, 404 U.S. 78, 83-84, 92 S.Ct. 254, 258, 30 L.Ed.2d 231 (1971).\n\n\n23\nWe conclude that Congress did not violate appellees' rights to equal protection by denying them the supplementary benefit. The judgment of the District Court is reversed.\n\n\n24\n\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n25\nJustice POWELL, with whom Justice BRENNAN, Justice MARSHALL, and Justice STEVENS join, dissenting.\n\n\n26\nThe Court holds that Congress rationally has denied a small monthly \"comfort allowance\" to otherwise eligible people solely because previously it rationally denied them Medicaid benefits. In my view, Congress thoughtlessly has applied a statutory classification developed to further legitimate goals of one welfare program to another welfare program serving entirely different needs.  The result is an exclusion of wholly dependent people from minimal benefits, serving no Government interest. This irrational classification violates the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\n\n27\n* The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a comprehensive federal program of minimal cash welfare benefits for the indigent blind, aged, and disabled.  86 Stat. 1465, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 et seq.  See generally Califano v. Aznavorian, 439 U.S. 170, 171, 99 S.Ct. 471, 472, 58 L.Ed.2d 435 (1978).  Section 1611(e)(1)(A) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(e)(1)(A), operates to reduce substantially, to $25 per month, the SSI benefits available to otherwise eligible persons who reside in public institutions. The reason for this reduction of benefit is understandable:\n\n\n28\n\"For these people most subsistence needs are met by the      institution and full benefits are not needed.  Some payment      to these people, though, would be needed to enable them to      purchase small comfort items not supplied by the      institution.\"  H.R.Rep. No. 92-231, p. 150 (1971), U.S.Code      Cong. & Admin.News 1972, p. 5136.\n\n\n29\nSee also S.Rep. No. 92-1230, p. 386 (1972).  This comfort allowance is provided to institution residents only if the qualified person resides in a public hospital or institution that receives Medicaid funds on his behalf.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(e)(1)(B). Thus, no comfort allowance will be paid to an individual unless the form of institutionalized treatment he receives is compensable under the separate Medicaid program.\n\n\n30\nAppellees are indigent people disabled by mental illness, and thus otherwise are eligible for SSI payments under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(A), (C).  As residents of public mental institutions between the ages of 21 and 65, however, they are ineligible to receive Medicaid benefits for their treatment.  \u00a7 1396a(a)(17)(B).1  For this reason, and none other, appellees may not receive the reduced monthly SSI payments available to inmates of other medical institutions, including patients in public medical hospitals and private mental institutions.2\n\n\n31\nThe refusal to pay for treatment in public mental institutions has a lengthy history in the development of the federal medical assistance programs.  See Legion v. Richardson, 354 F.Supp. 456 (SDNY), summarily aff'd sub nom. Legion v. Weinberger, 414 U.S. 1058, 94 S.Ct. 564, 38 L.Ed.2d 465 (1973). Initially, Congress broadly refused federal aid to individuals diagnosed as mentally ill, ch. 809, \u00a7\u00a7 303(a), 343(a), 351, 64 Stat. 549, 554, 557-558.  Subsequent enactments, however, have extended Medicaid coverage to treatment of mental illness in public or private medical hospitals or nursing homes, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396d(a)(1), (4) (1976 ed. and Supp.III), to treatment of mental illness of those under 21 and 65 or over in public mental institutions, \u00a7\u00a7 1396d(a)(14), (16).  Moreover, Congress has defined \"public institution\" not to include a publicly operated community residence center serving no more than 16 residents.  \u00a7 1382(e)(1)(C).  Thus, federal medical benefits have been extended to the mentally ill for treatment in various contexts.  The residual exclusion of large state institutions for the mentally ill from federal financial assistance rests on two related principles:  States traditionally have assumed the burdens of administering this form of care, and the Federal Government has long distrusted the economic and therapeutic efficiency of large mental institutions.  See S.Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 20 (1965), reprinted in 1965 U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1943, p. 2084.  See also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(h)(1)(B) (persons under 21 receive Medicaid benefits for treatment in mental institutions only when standards of utility are met).\n\n\n32\nThe legislative history of \u00a7 1611(e) sheds no light on why Congress made the exclusion from reduced SSI benefits coextensive with the exclusion from Medicaid payments.3  The Secretary argues that Congress might rationally have concluded that the States have the primary responsibility for making payments of comfort allowances to appellees, because they already bear the responsibility for paying for their treatment.  Brief for Appellant 27.  In accepting this justification, the Court adds that whether the States do, ever have, or ever will provide this benefit to residents of large mental institutions is irrelevant to the rationality of Congress' supposed judgment.   Ante, at 237, n. 20.\n\nII\nA.\n\n33\nSocial and economic legislation that does not employ suspect classifications or impinge on fundamental rights must be upheld under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment when the legislative means are rationally related to a legitimate Government purpose.  U. S. Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 101 S.Ct. 453, 66 L.Ed.2d 368 (1980).  See San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 17, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 1288, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973);  Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970).  This simply stated test holds two firmly established principles in tension.  The Court must not substitute its view of wise or fair legislative policy for that of the duly elected representatives of the people, Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 109, 99 S.Ct. 939, 949, 59 L.Ed.2d 171 (1979);  Dandridge, supra, at 485-486, 90 S.Ct. 1161-62, but the equal protection requirement does place a substantive limit on legislative power.  At a minimum, the legislature cannot arbitrarily discriminate among citizens.  E. g., Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361, 374-375, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 1169, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974);  James v. Strange, 407 U.S. 128, 140, 92 S.Ct. 2027, 2034, 32 L.Ed.2d 600 (1972);  Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U.S. 164, 175, 92 S.Ct. 1400, 1406, 31 L.Ed.2d 768 (1972).  Enforcing this prohibition while avoiding unwarranted incursions on the legislative power presents a difficult task.  No bright line divides the merely foolish from the arbitrary law.4 Given this difficulty, legislation properly enjoys a presumption of rationality, which is particularly strong for welfare legislation where the apportionment of scarce benefits in accordance with complex criteria requires painful but unavoidable line-drawing.  Mathews v. DeCastro, 429 U.S. 181, 185, 97 S.Ct. 431, 434, 50 L.Ed.2d 389 (1976).\n\n\n34\nThe deference to which legislative accommodation of conflicting interests is entitled rests in part upon the principle that the political process of our majoritarian democracy responds to the wishes of the people.  Accordingly, an important touchstone for equal protection review of statutes is how readily a policy can be discerned which the legislature intended to serve.  See, e. g., U. S. Dept. of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 536-538, 93 S.Ct. 2821, 2826-27, 37 L.Ed.2d 782 (1973);  McGinnis v. Royster, 410 U.S. 263, 270, 93 S.Ct. 1055, 1059, 35 L.Ed.2d 282 (1973).  When a legitimate purpose for a statute appears in the legislative history or is implicit in the statutory scheme itself, a court has some assurance that the legislature has made a conscious policy choice.  Our democratic system requires that legislation intended to serve a discernible purpose receive the most respectful deference.  See Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 100 S.Ct. 2671, 65 L.Ed.2d 784 (1980);  Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 479, 97 S.Ct. 2376, 2385, 53 L.Ed.2d 484 (1977);  Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975).  Yet, the question of whether a statutory classification discriminates arbitrarily cannot be divorced from whether it was enacted to serve an identifiable purpose.  When a legislative purpose can be suggested only by the ingenuity of a government lawyer litigating the constitutionality of a statute, a reviewing court may be presented not so much with a legislative policy choice as its absence.5\n\n\n35\nIn my view, the Court should receive with some skepticism post hoc hypotheses about legislative purpose, unsupported by the legislative history.6  When no indication of legislative purpose appears other than the current position of the Secretary, the Court should require that the classification bear a \"fair and substantial relation\" to the asserted purpose.  See F.S. Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U.S. 412, 415, 40 S.Ct. 560, 561, 64 L.Ed. 989 (1920).  This marginally more demanding scrutiny indirectly would test the plausibility of the tendered purpose, and preserve equal protection review as something more than \"a mere tautological recognition of the fact that Congress did what it intended to do.\"  Fritz, supra, at 180, 101 S.Ct., at 462 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).\n\nB\n\n36\nNeither the structure of \u00a7 1611 nor its legislative history identifies or even suggests any policy plausibly intended to be served by denying appellees the small SSI allowance.  As noted above, the only purpose identified in the House and Senate Reports is the irrelevant goal of depriving inmates of penal institutions of all benefits.  See n. 3, supra.  The structure of the statute offers no guidance as to purpose because \u00a7 1611(e) is drawn in reference to the policies of Medicaid rather than to the policies of SSI.  By mechanically applying the criteria developed for Medicaid, Congress appears to have avoided considering what criteria would be appropriate for deciding in which public institutions a person can reside and still be eligible for some SSI payment.  The importation of eligibility criteria from one statute to another creates significant risks that irrational distinctions will be made between equally needy people.  See U. S. Dept. of Agriculture v. Murry, 413 U.S. 508, 514, 93 S.Ct. 2832, 2835, 37 L.Ed.2d 767 (1973);  Medora v. Colautti, 602 F.2d 1149 (CA3 1979).\n\n\n37\nThe Secretary argues, and the Court agrees, that the exclusion \"is rationally related to the legitimate legislative desire to avoid spending federal resources on behalf of individuals whose care and treatment are being fully provided for by state and local government units.\"  Brief for Appellant 27. The Secretary does not argue that appellees are not in present need of the comfort allowance;  indeed, he concedes that \"the statutory classification does not exclude [appellees] because they were thought to be less needy.\"  Id., at 32.7  Nor does the Secretary suggest that because a State provides health care and the necessities of life to inmates of mental hospitals, the State also will provide the inmate with a comfort allowance. Indeed, the probability that a State will pay a patient a comfort allowance does not increase when the Federal Government refuses to relieve it of part of the cost of the patient's medical care.  The Court apparently recognizes this, as it states that whether or not a State actually provides a comfort allowance is irrelevant. Ante, at 237, n. 20.  Appellees simply are denied a benefit provided to other institutionalized, disabled patients.\n\n\n38\nBut, it is argued, Congress rationally could make the judgment that the States should bear the responsibility for any comfort allowance, because they already have the responsibility for providing treatment and minimal care.  There is no logical link, however, between these two responsibilities.  See U. S. Dept. of Agriculture v. Murry, supra.  Residence in a public mental hospital is rationally related to whether the Congress should pay for the patient's treatment.  Legion v. Richardson, 354 F.Supp. 456 (SDNY), summarily aff'd sub nom. Legion v. Weinberger, 414 U.S. 1058, 94 S.Ct. 564, 38 L.Ed.2d 465 (1973).  The judgment whether the Federal Government should subsidize care for the mentally ill in large public institutions involves difficult questions of medical and economic policy.  Supra, at 241-242. But residence in a public mental institution, as opposed to residence in a state medical hospital or a private mental hospital, bears no relation to any policy of the SSI program.  The monthly $25 allowance pays for small personal expenses, beyond the minimal care and treatment provided by Medicaid or \"other programs.\"  H.R.Rep. No. 96-451, pt. 1, p. 153 (1979).  If SSI pays a cash benefit relating to personal needs other than maintenance and medical care, it is irrelevant whether the State or the Federal Government is paying for the maintenance and medical care;  the patients' need remains the same, the likelihood that the policies of SSI will be fulfilled remains the same.\n\n\n39\nI conclude that Congress had no rational reason for refusing to pay a comfort allowance to appellees, while paying it to numerous otherwise identically situated disabled indigents.  This unexplained difference in treatment must have been a legislative oversight.  I therefore dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n The SSI program, Title XVI of the Social Security Act, largely replaced the prior system of federal grants to state-run assistance programs for the aged, blind, and disabled contained in Titles I, X, XIV, and XVI of the Act, that is, Old Age Assistance, 49 Stat. 620, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq.;  Aid to the Blind, 49 Stat. 645, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202 et seq.;  Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled, 64 Stat. 555, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1351 et seq.;  and Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled, 76 Stat. 197, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 et seq. (1970 ed.).  See Califano v. Aznavorian, 439 U.S. 170, 171, 99 S.Ct. 471, 472, 58 L.Ed.2d 435 (1978);  Califano v. Torres, 435 U.S. 1, 2, 98 S.Ct. 906, 907, 55 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978).\n\n\n2\n To be eligible for SSI benefits, a person must be \"aged,\" that is 65 or older, or \"blind,\" or \"disabled,\" as those terms are defined in \u00a7 1614 of the Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c, and his income and resources must be below the levels specified in \u00a7 1611(a), as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(a).\n\n\n3\n Section 1611(e)(1)(A), as amended, provides:\n\"(e) Limitation on eligibility of certain individuals\n\"(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) and (C), no person shall be an eligible individual or eligible spouse for purposes of this subchapter with respect to any month if throughout such month he is an inmate of a public institution.\"\n\n\n4\n Section 1611(e)(1)(B), as amended, modifying \u00a7 1611(e)(1)(A), as amended, states:\n\"(B) In any case where an eligible individual or his eligible spouse (if any) is, throughout any month, in a hospital, extended care facility, nursing home, or intermediate care facility receiving payments (with respect to such individual or spouse) under a State plan approved under title XIX, the benefit under this title for such individual for such month shall be payable\u2014\n\"(i) at a rate not in excess of $300 per year (reduced by the amount of any income not excluded pursuant to section 1612(b)) in the case of an individual who does not have an eligible spouse;\n\"(ii) in the case of an individual who has an eligible spouse, if only one of them is in such a hospital, home or facility throughout such month, at a rate not in excess of the sum of\u2014\n\"(I) the rate of $300 per year (reduced by the amount of any income, not excluded pursuant to section 1612(b), of the one who is in such hospital, home, or facility), and\n\"(II) the applicable rate specified in subsection (b)(1) (reduced by the amount of any income, not excluded pursuant to section 1612(b), of the other);  and\n\"(iii) at a rate not in excess of $600 per year (reduced by the amount of any income not excluded pursuant to section 1612(b)) in the case of an individual who has an eligible spouse, if both of them are in such a hospital, home, or facility throughout such month.\"\nSubsection (C) of \u00a7 1611(e)(1), not implicated in this case, further modifies \u00a7 1611(e)(1)(A), as amended, by providing:\n\"(C) As used in subparagraph (A), the term 'public institution' does not include a publicly operated community residence which serves no more than 16 residents.\"\nAdded in 1976 by Pub.L. 94-566, \u00a7 505(a), 90 Stat. 2686, this subsection met objections that \u00a7 1611(e) impeded reform efforts to de-institutionalize certain groups of handicapped individuals, such as the mentally retarded.  Congress determined to encourage the establishment of state-run group homes for such people by making residents in these institutions eligible for SSI benefits. See S.Rep. No. 94-1265, p. 29 (1976);  H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 94-1745, pp. 27-28 (1976), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1976, pp. 5997, 6032.\n\n\n5\n Federal funds are available under the Medicaid program to pay for the following \"residential\" services:  \"inpatient hospital services (other than services in an institution for tuberculosis or mental diseases),\" \u00a7 1905(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(a)(1); \"skilled nursing facility services (other than services in an institution for tuberculosis or mental diseases) for individuals 21 years of age or older,\" \u00a7 1905(a)(4)(A);  \"inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, and intermediate care facility services for individuals 65 years of age or over in an institution for tuberculosis or mental diseases,\" \u00a7 1905(a)(14); \"intermediate care facility services (other than such services in an institution for tuberculosis or mental diseases) for individuals . . . in need of such care,\" \u00a7 1905(a)(15);  certain \"inpatient psychiatric hospital services for individuals under age 21,\" \u00a7\u00a7 1905(a)(16) and (h).  Subsection (17)(B) of \u00a7 1905(a), which provides for funding of any other medical or remedial care recognized under state law, specifically excludes \"payments with respect to care or services for any individual who has not attained 65 years of age and who is a patient in an institution for tuberculosis or mental diseases.\"\nIn 1950, when it first enacted federal grants for medical assistance, Congress excluded \"any individual . . . who is a patient in an institution for . . . mental diseases\" from eligibility.  64 Stat. 558.  This exclusion was incorporated into the Medicaid statute in 1965, 79 Stat. 352, but exceptions were made for the needy aged in mental institutions, and for the care of mentally ill persons in general medical facilities.  Ibid.  In 1972, in the bill enacting the SSI program, Congress further broadened Medicaid benefits for the mentally ill to include most children in mental institutions.  86 Stat. 1461.  A Senate proposal for demonstration projects to investigate the possibility of extending Medicaid benefits to the mentally ill between the ages of 21 through 64 in mental hospitals was defeated at the time.  See S.Rep. No. 92-1230, p. 281 (1972);  H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 92-1605, p. 65 (1972), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1972, pp. 4989, 5370.\n\n\n6\n This Court repeatedly has held that the Fifth Amendment imposes on the Federal Government the same standard required of state legislation by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See, e. g. Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U.S. 749, 768-770, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2468-69, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975);  Richardson v. Belcher, 404 U.S. 78, 81, 92 S.Ct. 254, 257, 30 L.Ed.2d 231 (1971).\n\n\n7\n The three-judge court also found that the state statute classified on the basis of age, not mental health, and that it was rational and constitutional.  The Court of Appeals declined to review that constitutional holding on the ground that review from the three-judge court could be had only in this Court.  Wilson v. Edelman, 542 F.2d, at 1276-1282.\n\n\n8\n The Court of Appeals also held that only two of the named plaintiffs, Maudie Simmons and John Kiernan Turney, had satisfied the minimum, nonwaivable requirement of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) that a party may seek review only of a \"final decision of the Secretary\" denying, terminating, or suspending benefits under the SSI program.  The other named plaintiffs, including Charles Wilson, were eligible for, or had sought and been denied, benefits only under the prior cooperative state-federal programs, and therefore they were dismissed as parties.  We have retained Wilson as a named party in the caption of this case, however, as did the District Court on remand, for the sake of uniformity.\n\n\n9\n The class was defined as \"all persons residing in HEW Region V who have been terminated from benefits under Title XVI, or who have applied for Supplemental Security Income benefits under Title XVI and have been denied such benefits, on or after January 1, 1974, solely because they are between the ages of 21 and 65 and hospitalized in a public mental institution.\"  App. to Juris. Statement 21a.\n\n\n10\n The District Court denied, however, the claim of the pretrial detainees to the monthly stipend, applying a \"rational relation\" standard and finding the exclusion rational because \"[t]he detainee status is necessarily temporary in nature, and the [Secretary] could legitimately wish to withhold these extra-subsistence payments while the detainee is housed in a public institution and until his future status is determined.\" 478 F.Supp., at 1055.\n\n\n11\n The District Court noted that a person's mental health problem, especially one that has led to institutionalization, is likely to \" 'bear [a] relation to ability to perform or contribute to society.' \"  Id., at 1051-1052, quoting Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 686, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 1770, 36 L.Ed.2d 583 (1973).  The court also acknowledged that \"[i]t is debatable whether and to what extent the mental illness is an 'immutable characteristic determined solely by the accident of birth.' \"  478 F.Supp., at 1052, again quoting Frontiero, 411 U.S., at 686, 93 S.Ct., at 1770.\n\n\n12\n The Secretary argued that the statutory exclusion has three purposes:  \"1) the conservation of federal resources;  2) the concern that federal funds be received on behalf of residents of qualified institutions;  and 3) the fact that plaintiffs are not 'similarly situated' with Medicaid patients in terms of federal interest and control.\"  478 F.Supp., at 1053.\n\n\n13\n We therefore intimate no view as to what standard of review applies to legislation expressly classifying the mentally ill as a discrete group.\n\n\n14\n Social Security Administration statistics show that 30.7% of all blind and disabled adult persons awarded SSI benefits in 1975 (109,509 persons) were deemed disabled by mental disorders, and the Administration has concluded that \"[m]ental illness was the most common cause of disability in 1975.\"  Kochhar, Blind and Disabled Persons Awarded Federally Administered SSI Payments, 1975, Social Security Bulletin 13, 15 (June 1979).  Half of this number suffered from mental illness rather than mental retardation, and these statistics did not include any persons with prior entitlement to benefits.  Ibid.\nFurther, as a recent study also indicates, a substantial number of mentally ill people in institutions actually receive SSI benefits.  Social Security Administration, Representative Payments under the SSI Program, August, 1977, Research and Statistics Note No. 9 (Sept. 16, 1980).  This study established that 15% of the total population receiving SSI benefits (for all reasons, including age, blindness, and disability) had \"representative payees\" (a person \"appointed to manage the benefits of an adult beneficiary\" because of \"the adult beneficiary's inability to manage his own funds\").  Id., at 1.  Out of a total of 184,133 institutionalized persons who were receiving SSI benefits in August 1977 through such \"representative payees,\" 76,494, or approximately 41%, were institutionalized because of mental disorders.  Id., at 7 (Table 6) and 2 (Table 1).  Thus, even on this incomplete data, a sizable number of SSI recipients were persons institutionalized for mental illness.\n\n\n15\n Appellees appear to concede the rationality of Congress' general exclusion of publicly institutionalized persons from full SSI benefits.\n\n\n16\n An otherwise eligible person does not receive SSI benefits if he is receiving long-term treatment in a medical facility that is not certified under Medicaid standards as a provider.  See \u00a7 1861 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x.  These strict standards exclude many facilities but work to the ultimate benefit of those receiving Medicaid.  Cf. O'Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center, 447 U.S. 773, 100 S.Ct. 2467, 65 L.Ed.2d 506 (1980).\n\n\n17\n The average inpatient stay in public mental hospitals is short.  Recently collected data for 1975 reveal a median stay in state and county mental hospitals of only 25.5 days.  Witkin, Characteristics of Admissions to Selected Mental Health Facilities, 1975:  An Annotated Book of Charts and Tables, National Institute of Mental Health 93, DHHS Publication No. (ADM) 80-1005 (1981).  This study also showed that young and elderly patients had longer periods of stay than patients in the middle-age group.  Id., at 95.  The rapidity with which inpatients are released from public institutions has increased since the 1950's.  In 1971 75% of all patients admitted to state mental hospitals were released within the first three months, while 87% were released within the first six months.  Ozarin, Redick & Taube, A Quarter Century of Psychiatric Care, 1950-1974:  A Statistical Review, 27 Hospital & Community Psychiatry 515, 516 (1976).  Data from the National Institute of Mental Health show that the proportion of \"patient care episodes\" (admissions during a year plus residents at the beginning of the year) attributable to inpatient treatment at state and county hospitals declined from 49% in 1955 to 9% in 1977.  This dramatic decrease in the percentage of persons admitted to these hospitals was paralleled by a growth in treatment through outpatient and community mental health facilities;  that percentage grew from 23% in 1955 to 76% in 1977.  Witkin, Trends in Patient Care Episodes in Mental Health Facilities, 1955-1977, National Institute of Mental Health, Mental Health Statistical Note No. 154, p. 3 (Sept. 1980).  At the same time, the total number of \"patient care episodes\" increased fourfold, from approximately 1.7 million in 1955 to 6.9 million in 1977.  Id., at 1.\n\n\n18\n To be eligible for Medicaid reimbursement for inpatient services, mentally ill persons under the age of 21 being treated in mental institutions must be receiving \"active treatment\" that meets standards prescribed by the Secretary and that \"can reasonably be expected to improve the condition, by reason of which such services are necessary, to the extent that eventually such services will no longer be necessary.\"  \u00a7 1905(h)(1)(B) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(h)(1)(B).\n\n\n19\n The Medicaid limitation was based on Congress' assumption that the care of persons in public mental institutions was properly a responsibility of the States.  See H.R.Rep. No. 1300, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 42 (1949) (enacting federal funding for services to the needy aged, blind, and disabled provided in public medical institutions, but excluding assistance to those in \"public or private institutions for mental illness and tuberculosis, since the States have generally provided for medical care of such cases\");  S.Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, pp. 144-147 (1965), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1965, p. 1943 (enactment of Medicaid providing coverage only to the aged needy in mental or tuberculosis institutions;  noting that \"[t]he reason for this exclusion was that long-term care in such hospitals had traditionally been accepted as a responsibility of the States,\" id., at 144, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1965, p. 2084.  This exclusion was upheld in Legion v. Richardson, 354 F.Supp. 456 (SDNY), summarily aff'd sub nom. Legion v. Weinberger, 414 U.S. 1058, 94 S.Ct. 564, 38 L.Ed.2d 465 (1973), and Kantrowitz v. Weinberger, 388 F.Supp. 1127 (DC 1974), aff'd, 174 U.S.App.D.C. 182, 530 F.2d 1034, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 819, 97 S.Ct. 64, 50 L.Ed.2d 79 (1976), and appellees disavow any intention to dispute that holding.  Brief for Appellees 26-27;  Tr. of Oral Arg. 19.\n\n\n20\n Whether a State chooses to elect or not to elect to provide an equivalent monthly stipend to institutionalized mental patients does not alter the rationality of Congress' decision.\n\n\n21\n The Secretary has interpreted \u00a7 1611(e)(1)(B) to require that at least 50% of the cost of services be reimbursed by Medicaid before the reduction of benefits becomes effective.  20 CFR \u00a7 416.231(b)(5) (1980).\n\n\n22\n Congress continues to investigate other more general solutions and to propose alterations in \u00a7 1611(e).  See H.R.Rep. No. 96-451, pt. 1, p. 153 (1979);  125 Cong.Rec. 31349-31350, 31354-31355, 31356 (1979) (remarks of Rep. Corman, Rep. Pepper, and Rep. Bingham) (proposing amendment to \u00a7 1611(e) to forestall reduction of benefits until after eligible individual has been institutionalized in a Medicaid institution for three months); Staff of the Senate Committee on Finance, The Supplemental Security Income Program, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., 109-115 (Comm. Print 1977) (advocating legislative amendments standardizing the monthly stipend to institutionalized persons).\n\n\n23\n \"When a legal distinction is determined, as no one doubts that it may be, between night and day, childhood and maturity, or any other extremes, a point has to be fixed or a line has to be drawn, or gradually picked out by successive decisions, to mark where the change takes place.  Looked at by itself without regard to the necessity behind it the line or point seems arbitrary.  It might as well or nearly as well be a little more to one side or the other.  But when it is seen that a line or point there must be, and that there is no mathematical or logical way of fixing it precisely, the decision of the legislature must be accepted unless we can say that it is very wide of any reasonable mark.\" Louisville Gas Co. v. Coleman, 277 U.S. 32, 41, 48 S.Ct. 423, 426, 72 L.Ed. 770 (1928) (Holmes, J., dissenting).\n\n\n24\n The amount of money, and the number of people potentially involved, are not inconsiderable.  Although the appellees do not agree, the Secretary estimates that the annual cost of implementing the District Court's order nationwide would approximate $30 million.  Reply Memorandum for Appellant 3.  In 1979, a total of almost 2.2 million people were receiving SSI benefits for disabilities, an increase of over 900,000 from January 1974.  See Social Security Bulletin 49 (Table M-24) (June 1979).  Further, of all the disabled adults who applied for benefits between January 1974 and July 1975, 1.1% were denied eligibility by reason of their residence in a public institution. See S.Rep. No. 95-1312, p. 7 (table) (1978).\n\n\n1\n Other classes of institutionalized people denied the reduced SSI allowance include patients in tubercular institutions and prison inmates.\n\n\n2\n The Court too quickly dispatches the argument that \u00a7 1611(e) classifies on the basis of mental illness.  While it is true that not all mentally ill people are denied the benefit, and that some people denied the benefit are not mentally ill, it is inescapable that appellees are denied the benefit because they are patients in mental institutions.  Only the mentally ill are treated in mental institutions.  While I would agree that there is no indication that Congress intended to punish or slight the mentally ill, the history of Medicaid demonstrates Congress' disinclination to involve the Federal Government in state treatment of mental illness in public institutions.  See, infra, this page and 242. Because I find the classification irrational, I do not reach the question whether classifications drawn in part on the basis of mental health require heightened scrutiny as appellees suggest.\n\n\n3\n The only indication of congressional intent states:  \"No assistance benefits will be paid to an individual in a penal institution.\"  H.R.Rep. No. 92-231, p. 150 (1971), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1972, p. 5136.  A mental hospital is not a penal institution.  Neither the Secretary nor the Court argues that the exclusion of appellees from the comfort allowance rationally furthers this purpose.\n\n\n4\n The Court has employed numerous formulations for the \"rational basis\" test.  U. S. Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 176-177, n. 10, 101 S.Ct. 453, 460, n. 10 (1980). Members of the Court continue to hold divergent views on the clarity with which a legislative purpose must appear, see id., at 180-181, 101 S.Ct., at 461-462 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment);  id., at 187-188, 101 S.Ct., at 465-466 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), and about the degree of deference afforded the legislature in suiting means to ends, compare Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U.S. 61, 78-79, 31 S.Ct. 337, 340, 55 L.Ed. 369 (1911), with F.S. Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U.S. 412, 415, 40 S.Ct. 560, 561, 64 L.Ed. 989 (1920).\n\n\n5\n Congress' failure to make policy judgments can distort our system of separation of powers by encouraging other branches to make essentially legislative decisions.  See Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 743, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 1981, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (POWELL, J., dissenting).\n\n\n6\n Some of our cases suggest that the actual purpose of a statute is irrelevant, Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 612, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 1373, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (1960), and that the statute must be upheld \"if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify\" its discrimination, McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 426, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 1105, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961).  Although these cases preserve an important caution, they do not describe the importance of actual legislative purpose in our analysis.  We recognize that a legislative body rarely acts with a single mind and that compromises blur purpose.  Therefore, it is appropriate to accord some deference to the executive's view of legislative intent, as similarly we accord deference to the consistent construction of a statute by the administrative agency charged with its enforcement.  E. g., Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965).  Ascertainment of actual purpose to the extent feasible, however, remains an essential step in equal protection.\n\n\n7\n This concession makes it difficult to accept the Court's conclusion that Congress rationally could have decided that \"Medicaid recipients in public institutions . . . are the most needy and the most deserving of the small monthly supplement.\" Ante, at 239.\n\n\n","label":1}

Dailey.\nNo appearance for Louise Virginia Smith.\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nAppellee Smith (No. 20) was indicted October 2, 1950, for having on or about July 1, 1947, forged the name of the payee on a check drawn on the Treasurer of the United States.\n\n\n2\nAppellee Dailey (No. 162) was indicted September 29, 1950, for having on or about March 14, 1947, knowingly made a false statement in connection with his application for Farmers Home Administration services.\n\n\n3\nIn each case the crime charged was committed more than three years before the indictment was returned and therefore would be barred by the three-year statute of limitations, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3282, unless that statute has been tolled. The prosecution argued that it was tolled by the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act of 1942, as amended, 18 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) \u00a7 590a. The District Court in each case disagreed with the prosecution and dismissed the indictment. The cases are here on appeal. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3731.\n\n\n4\nThe Act derives from the Act of August 24, 1942, which suspended the running of the statute of limitations applicable to offenses involving frauds against the United States until June 30, 1945, or until such earlier time as the Congress by concurrent resolution, or the President, may designate. 56 Stat. 747. That Act was amended by the Contract Settlement Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 649, 667, to provide among other things that the term of suspension of the statute of limitations was 'until three years after the termination of hostilities in the present war as proclaimed by the President or by a concurrent resolution of the two Houses of Congress.' Offenses in connection with the negotiation, award, termination, or settlement of contracts were included by that Act. And offenses in connection with the care, handling, and disposal of property were added by the Surplus Property Act of 1944. 58 Stat. 765, 781. At the time of the alleged offenses the Act read in relevant part:1 'The running of any existing statute of limitations applicable to any offense against the laws of the United States (1) involving defrauding or attempts to defraud the United States or any agency thereof whether by conspiracy or not, and in any manner, * * * shall be suspended until three years after the termination of hostilities in the present war as proclaimed by the President or by a concurrent resolution of the two Houses of Congress.'\n\n\n5\nThe hostilities of World War II were declared terminated December 31, 1946, by Presidential Proclamation No. 2714, 61 Stat. (Pt. 2) 1048\u20141049; 12 Fed.Reg. 1, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 601 note. It is therefore clear that if the designated offenses were committed within the three-year period prior to the date of the Act or between the date of the Act and December 31, 1946, the statute of limitations would be suspended. The question is whether the Act is likewise applicable to offenses committed after December 31, 1946, the date of the proclamation of termination of hostilities.\n\n\n6\nThe argument of the prosecution is that the language of the Act makes no distinction between offenses committed before and offenses committed after the termination of hostilities, the emphasis of the Act being on the suspension of the 'running' of the statutes of limitations. It is contended that the extension of the Act to offenses prescribed by the Contract Settlement Act and the Surplus Property Act\u2014offenses of the type likely to be committed during the post-hostilities period\u2014is persuasive indication that Congress made the Act operative after, as well as before, the termination of hostilities.\n\n\n7\nWe take the contrary view. We conclude that the Suspension Act is inapplicable to crimes committed after the date of termination of hostilities. The words of the Act are that the 'running' of the statute of limitations 'shall be suspended until three years after the termination of hostilities'. The connotation is that offenses occurring prior to the termination of hostilities shall not be allowed legally to be forgotten in the rush of the war activities. That is the gist of the Reports.2 The fear was that the law-enforcement officers would be so preoccupied with prosecution of the war effort that the crimes of fraud perpetrated against the United States would be forgotten until it was too late. The implicit premise of the legislation is that the frenzied activities, existing at the time the Act became law, would continue until hostilities terminated and that until then the public interest should not be disadvantaged. The prosecution would have us change the function of the date of termination of hostilities. If would be used to provide various periods of suspension for crimes committed within the three-year period commencing with the termination of hostilities. That seems to us to be an alteration in the statutory scheme, one that destroys its symmetry. Since under our construction the three-year period prescribed by the Suspension Act starts to run at the date of termination of hostilities, all crimes to which the Act is applicable are treated uniformity. The time when law-enforcement officers were busy with war activities is not counted; when the pressure was off, the time began to run again. No reasons of policy are suggested for straining the language of the Act to suspend the rumming of the statute beyond the emergency which made the suspension seem advisable.\n\n\n8\nAffirmed.\n\n\n9\nMr. Justice CLARK, concurring.\n\n\n10\nI join in the opinion and judgment of the Court. Soon after the beginning of World War II, Congress realized that it would be impossible for the Department of Justice currently to investigate and prosecute the large number of offenses arising out of the war effort. Therefore Congress suspended the running of the statute of limitations as to frauds against the Government, first until June 30, 1945, and subsequently until three years after the termination of hostilities. It is clear that Congress intended to give the Department more time to apprehend, investigate, and prosecute offenses occurring 'under the stress of present-day events' of the war 'even after the termination of the present conflict.' H.R.Rep.No. 2051, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 2; S.Rep.No. 1544, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 2; see United States v. Gottfried, 2 Cir., 1948, 165 F.2d 360. V-E Day was May 8, 1945, and V-J Day was September 2, 1945. Immediately after V-J Day all war procurement stopped, contracts were canceled, and renegotiation was speeded up. The President did not proclaim the cessation of hostilities until December 31, 1946, sixteen months after the fighting ceased. During this period, the pressing problems of demobilization and reconversion\u2014problems likely to cause the continued perpetration of frauds on the Government\u2014were for the most part brought to an end.\n\n\n11\nThe present cases had nothing to do with the war or the reconversion thereafter, Smith being charged with forgery of a Government check for $90 dated June 30, 1947, and Dailey being indicted for having made a false statement on March 14, 1947, to the Department of Agriculture as to value of his farm, cows, poultry, etc., in connection with an application for the services of the Farmers Home Administration. Both of the offenses occurred long after the fighting war was over and after 'the intensive preoccupation of both participants and witnesses with the war effort'* had ceased, if ever those persons were so employed.\n\n\n12\nThese cases clearly illustrate that the suspension statute was not intended to and should not embrace offenses committed subsequent to December 31, 1946. It applies only to offenses committed between August 25, 1939, and December 31, 1946. For those offenses which occurred between the date of the 1942 Act and the cessation of hostilities, Congress' intention was to give the Department of Justice six years from the latter date to investigate and prosecute. For those offenses which occurred before the date of the 1942 Act, Congress' intention was to give the Department three years after the cessation of hostilities plus whatever portion of the regular three-year limitations' period had not yet run when the 1942 Act was passed.\n\n\n13\nMr. Justice MINTON, with whom Mr. Justice REED, Mr. Justice JACKSON and Mr. Justice BURTON join, dissenting.\n\n\n14\nAs I read the statute, Congress intended the statute of limitations to be suspended until three years after the termination of hostilities, which would be December 31, 1949. Until that time, there was to be no statute of limitations. On that date the suspension was lifted, and the statute began to run again. The Court's construction that the suspension was lifted at the termination of hostilities gives no effect to the three-year period. I would reverse the judgments in these cases.\n\n\n\n1\n The Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 683, which revised the Criminal Code, repealed the Suspension Act (id., 862, 868) and, with a few changes in wording, re-enacted it. Id., 828, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3287, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3287. Section 21 of the 1948 Act, 18 U.S.C.A. following \u00a7 5037, preserved all 'rights or liabilities' under the repealed sections. We assume, without deciding, that this reservation has no effect on the running of a statute of limitations. See United States v. Obermeier, 2 Cir., 186 F.2d 243, 251. The Reviser added at the beginning of the section a new clause reading 'when the United States is at war' to make the section 'permanent instead of temporary legislation, and to obviate the necessity of reenacting such legislation in the future.' See Reviser's note following 18 U.S.C. (Supp. II) \u00a7 3287, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3287.\n\n\n2\n S.Rep.No.1544, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 1\u20142:\n'The purpose of the proposed legislation is to suspend any existing statutes of limitations applicable to offenses involving the defrauding or attempts to defraud the United States or any agency thereof, for the period of the present war. Contracting for the United States is done through its various agencies, including the departments and independent establishments and Government-owned and Government-controlled corporations, and frauds against all of these agencies are intended to be embraced by the bill.\n'During normal times the present 3-year statute of limitations may afford the Department of Justice sufficient time to investigate, discover, and gather evidence to prosecute frauds against the Government. The United States, however, is engaged in a gigantic war program. Huge sums of money are being expended for materials and equipment in order to carry on the war successfully. Although steps have been taken to prevent and to prosecute frauds against the Government, it is recognized that in the varied dealings opportunities will no doubt be presented for unscrupulous persons to defraud the Government or some agency. These frauds may be difficult to discover as is often true of this type of offense and many of them may not come to light for some time to come. The law-enforcement branch of the Government is also busily engaged in its many duties, including the enforcement of the espionage, sabotage, and other laws.\n'Your committee is of the opinion that action should be taken at this time to extend the limitations statute so that frauds may be discovered and punished even after the termination of the present conflict, and to insure that the limitations statute will not operate, under stress of the present-day events, for the protection of those who would defraud or attempt to defraud the United States.'\nThe history of the 1944 Amendment supports the same view. S.Rep.No.1057, 78th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 14, states: 'As was provided in the Contract Settlement Act of 1944, the statute of limitations with respect to offense against the laws of the United States arising in connection with activities under this act was suspended until 3 years after termination of hostilities in the present war. This provision has been necessitated by the magnitude of the operations involved under this act, and the intensive preoccupation of both participants and witnesses with the war effort. It is clear that the bulk of the offenses cognizable under this statute will not be apprehended or investigated until the end of the war and will then require considerable time before they advance to the stage of litigation.'\n\n\n*\n S.Rep.No.1057, 78th Cong., 2d Sess. 14.\n\n\n","label":0}

Nabrit III, for petitioners.\nJack Petree, for respondents.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nIn 1966 the District Court for the Western District of Tennessee approved a plan of respondent Board of Education for the desegregation of the Memphis school system. In July 1968 petitioners made a motion that the court order the Board to adopt a new plan prepared with the assistance of the Title IV Center of the University of Tennessee. The Center is funded by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The 1966 plan permitted unrestricted free transfers, and petitioners desired a plan without such a provision, and one that would also provide among other things for complete faculty desegregation. The District Court denied the motion as filed but on May 15, 1969, in an unreported opinion, directed respondent Board to file a revised plan which would incorporate the existing plan (as respondent proposed during the hearing to supplement it), and which also would contain a modified transfer provision, a provision for the appointment of a Director of Desegregation charged with responsibility to devise ways and means 'of assisting the Board in its affirmative duty to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination will be eliminated root and branch,' and provision for faculty desegregation. The court also directed that, prior to January 1, 1970, the Board file a map of proposed revised zone boundary lines and enrollment figures by race within the revised zones to enable the court then to 'reconsider the adequacy of the transfer plan.' The District Court expressly found that such further steps were necessary because, although the respondent Board 'has acted in good faith,' 'the existing and proposed (supplemental) plans do not have real prospects for dismantling the state-imposed dual system at the 'earliest practicable date.\" Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. In June 1969 they filed a Motion for Summary Reversal and on November 3, 1969, after this Court's decision in Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, 396 U.S. 19, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19 (1969), a motion to require adoption of a unitary system now. Both motions were denied on December 19, 1969, and the case was remanded to the District Court; the Court of Appeals stated that action on its part would be premature 'until the United States District Court has had submitted to it the ordered plan, and has had opportunity to consider and act upon it.'\n\n\n2\nPetitioners thereupon filed in the Court of Appeals a motion for injunction pending certiorari which, in reliance upon Alexander v. Holmes County Board, sought an injunction requiring respondent Board 'to prepare and file on or before January 5, 1970, in addition to the adjusted zone lines it is presently required to file, a plan for the operation of the City of Memphis public schools as a unitary system during the current 1969\u201470 school year.' The motion was denied on January 12, 1970, on the ground that Alexander v. Holmes County Board was inapplicable to the case because '(the Court of Appeals is) satisfied that the respondent Board of Education of Memphis is not now operating a 'dual school system' and has, subject to complying with the present commands of the District Judge, converted its pre-Brown dual system into a unitary system 'within which no person is to be effectively excluded because of race or color.\"\n\n\n3\nPetitioners, on January 30, 1970, filed in this Court a petition for certiorari and a motion for injunction pending certiorari 'requiring the preparation, with the assistance of H.E.W. or the H.E.W. funded University of Tennessee Title IV Center, of a plan of complete pupil and faculty integration affecting all phases of the operations of the Memphis public school system, for implementation during the 1969\u201470 school year in conformity with * * * Alexander v. Holmes County Bd. * * *.'\n\n\n4\nThe petition for certiorari is branted. We hold that the Court of Appeals erred in the following respects:\n\n\n5\n1. Since the findings of the District Court\u2014that the state-imposed dual system had not been dismantled under the 1966 plan and that that plan and the Board's proposed supplemental plan did 'not have real prospects for dismantling (it) * * * at the 'earliest practicable date\"\u2014are supported by substantial evidence, the Court of Appeals erred in substituting its own finding that respondent Board 'is not now operating a 'dual school system' * * *.'\n\n\n6\n2. Since it appears that neither the revised plan of desegregation filed on June 9, 1969, nor the revised school zones and updated enrollment figures which were ordered to be filed on or before January 1, 1970, were properly before the Court of Appeals for review, it was premature for the Court of Appeals to rule that the Board 'has, subject to complying with the present commands of the District Judge, converted its pre-Brown dual system into a unitary system 'within which no person is to be effectively excluded because of race or color.\"\n\n\n7\n3. In holding that Alexander v. Holmes County Board is inapplicable to this case.\n\n\n8\nThe Court of Appeals' order of remand of December 19, 1969, is affirmed, but with direction that the District Court proceed promptly to consider the issues before it and to decide the case consistently with Alexander v. Holmes County Board. The order of the Court of Appeals of January 12, 1970, denying injunctive relief is affirmed. The motion for injunction pending certiorari filed in this Court is denied.\n\n\n9\nThe judgment herein shall issue forthwith.\n\n\n10\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n11\nMr. Justice MARSHALL took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n12\nMr. Chief Justice BURGER, concurring in the result.\n\n\n13\nSave for one factor, I would grant the petition and set the case for expedited argument at a special sitting, if necessary. The factor which is a barrier to taking this step now in this particular case is that one Justice would not be able to participate, thus limiting the Court to seven justices. I would do this on the basis that the time has come to clear up what seems to be a confusion, genuine or simulated, concering this Court's prior mandates. By the time of No. 944, Carter v. West Feliciana Parish School Board, 396 U.S. 290, 90 S.Ct. 608, 24 L.Ed.2d 477 (1970), Mr. Justice Stewart and I indicated we preferred not to reach decision without first hearing oral argument.\n\n\n14\nThese school cases present widely varying factors: some records reveal plans for desegregating schools, others have no plans or only partial plans; some records reflect rezoning of school districts, others do not; some use traditional bus transportation such as began with consolidated schools where such transportation was imperative, others use school bus transportation for a different purpose and unrelated to the availability of a school as to which such transportation is not required.\n\n\n15\nThe suggestion that the Court has not defined a unitary school system is not supportable. In Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, 396 U.S. 19, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19 (1969), we stated, albeit perhaps too cryptically, that a unitary system was one 'within which no person is to be effectively excluded from any school because of race or color.' From what is now before us in this case it is not clear what issues might be raised or developed on argument. As soon as possible, however, we ought to resolve some of the basic practical problems when they are appropriately presented including whether, as a constitutional matter, any particular racial balance must be achieved in the schools; to what extent school districts and zones may or must be altered as a constitutional matter; and to what extent transportation may or must be provided to achieve the ends sought by prior holdings of the Court. Other related issues may emerge.\n\n\n16\nHowever, for the reasons stated, namely that the Court is already disabled by one vacancy of long standing and further disabled in the particular case, I join in the result reached by the Court.\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"424 U.S. 747\n96 S.Ct. 1251\n47 L.Ed.2d 444\nHarold FRANKS and Johnnie Lee, Petitioners,v.BOWMAN TRANSPORTATION COMPANY, INC., et al.\nNo. 74-728.\nArgued Nov. 3, 1975.\nDecided March 24, 1976.\n\nSyllabus\nIn a class action against respondent employer and certain labor unions (of which respondent union is the successor) petitioners alleged various racially discriminatory employment practices in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Act), especially with respect to employment of over-the-road (OTR) truck drivers. After certifying the action as a class action and, Inter alia, designating one of the classes represented by petitioner Lee as consisting of black nonemployee applicants who applied for and were denied OTR positions prior to January 1, 1972, the District Court permanently enjoined the respondents from perpetuating the discriminatory practices found to exist, and, in regard to the black applicants for OTR positions, ordered the employer to notify the members of the designated class of their right to priority consideration for such jobs. But the court declined to grant the unnamed members of the class any specific relief sought, which included an award of backpay and seniority status retroactive to the date of individual application for an OTR position. While vacating the District Court's judgment insofar as it failed to award backpay to unnamed members of the class and reversing on other grounds, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's denial of any form of seniority relief, holding that such relief was barred, as a matter of law, by \u00a7 703(h) of Title VII, which provides that it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer, Inter alia, to apply different conditions of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority system. Held:\n1. That petitioner Lee, the named plaintiff representing the class in question, no longer has a personal stake in the outcome of the action because he had been hired by respondent employer and later was properly discharged for cause, does not moot the case. An adverse relationship sufficient to meet the requirement that a \"live controversy\" remain before this Court not only obtained as to unnamed members of the class with respect to the underlying cause of action but also continues with respect to their assertion that the relief they have received in entitlement to consideration for hiring and backpay is inadequate without further award of entitlement to seniority benefits. Pp. 752-757.\n2. Section 703(h) does not bar seniority relief to unnamed members of the class in question, who are not seeking modification or elimination of the existing seniority system but only an award of the seniority status they would have individually enjoyed under the present system but for the illegal discriminatory refusal to hire. The thrust of \u00a7 703(h) is directed toward defining what is and what is not an illegal discriminatory employment practice in instances in which the post-Act operation of a seniority system is challenged as perpetuating the effects of discrimination occurring prior to the Act's effective date, and there is no indication in the legislative materials concerning it that \u00a7 703(h) was intended to modify or restrict relief otherwise appropriate under the Act once an illegal discriminatory practice occurring after the Act's effective date is proved, such as a discriminatory refusal to hire as in this case. Pp. 757-762.\n3. An award of seniority retroactive to the date of the individual job application is appropriate under \u00a7 706(g) of Title VII, which, to effectuate Title VII's objective of making persons whole for injuries suffered on account of unlawful employment discrimination, vests broad equitable discretion in the federal courts to \"order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without back pay . . . or any other relief as the court deems appropriate.\" Merely to require respondent employer to hire the class victim of discrimination falls far short of a \"make whole\" remedy, and a concomitant award of the seniority credit he presumptively would have earned but for the wrongful treatment would also seem necessary absent justification for denying that relief. Without a seniority award dating from the time when he was discriminatorily refused employment, an individual who applies for and obtains employment as an OTR driver pursuant to the District Court's order will never obtain his rightful place in the hierarchy of seniority according to which various employment benefits are distributed. Pp. 762-770.\n4. denial of seniority relief for the unnamed class members cannot be justified as within the District Court's discretion on the grounds given by that court that such individuals had not filed administrative charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under Title VII and that there was no evidence of a \"vacancy, qualification, and performance\" for every individual member of the class. Nor can the denial of such relief be justified as within the District Court's discretion on the ground that an award of retroactive seniority to the class of discriminatees will conflict with the economic interests of other employees of respondent employer. The District Court made no mention of such considerations in denying relief, and to deny relief on such a ground would, if applied generally, frustrate the \"make whole\" objective of Title VII. Pp. 770-779.\n495 F.2d 398, reversed and remanded.\nMorris J. Baller, New York City, for petitioners.\nMichael H. Gottesman, Washington, D. C., for respondent United Steelworkers of America.\nWilliam M. Pate, Atlanta, Ga., for respondent Bowman Transportation Co., Inc.\nMr. Justice BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis case presents the question whether identifiable applicants who were denied employment because of race after the effective date and in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e Et seq. (1970 ed. and Supp. IV), may be awarded seniority status retroactive to the dates of their employment applications.1\n\n\n2\nPetitioner Franks brought this class action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against his former employer, respondent Bowman Transportation Co., and his unions, the International Union of District 50, Allied and Technical Workers of the United States and Canada, and its local, No. 13600,2 alleging various racially discriminatory employment practices in violation of Title VII. Petitioner Lee intervened on behalf of himself and others similarly situated alleging racially discriminatory hiring and discharge policies limited to Bowman's employment of over-the-road (OTR) truck drivers. Following trial, the District Court found that Bowman had engaged in a pattern of racial discrimination in various company policies, including the hiring, transfer, and discharge of employees, and found further that the discriminatory practices were perpetrated in Bowman's collective-bargaining agreement with the unions. The District Court certified the action as a proper class action under Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23(b)(2), and of import to the issues before this Court, found that petitioner Lee represented all black applicants who sought to be hired or to transfer to OTR driving positions prior to January 1, 1972. In its final order and decree, the District Court subdivided the class represented by petitioner Lee into a class of black nonemployee applicants for OTR positions prior to January 1, 1972 (class 3), and a class of black employees who applied for transfer to OTR positions prior to the same date (class 4).\n\n\n3\nIn its final judgment entered July 14, 1972, the District Court permanently enjoined the respondents from perpetuating the discriminatory practices found to exist, and, in regard to the black applicants for OTR positions, ordered Bowman to notify the members of both subclasses within 30 days of their right to priority consideration for such jobs. The District Court declined, however, to grant to the unnamed members of classes 3 and 4 any other specific relief sought, which included an award of backpay and seniority status retroactive to the date of individual application for an OTR position.\n\n\n4\nOn petitioners' appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, raising for the most part claimed inadequacy of the relief ordered respecting unnamed members of the various subclasses involved, the Court of Appeals affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated in part. 495 F.2d 398 (1974). The Court of Appeals held that the District Court had exercised its discretion under an erroneous view of law insofar as it failed to award backpay to the unnamed class members of both classes 3 and 4, and vacated the judgment in that respect. The judgment was reversed insofar as it failed to award any seniority remedy to the members of class 4 who after the judgment of the District Court sought and obtained priority consideration for transfer to OTR positions.3 As respects unnamed members of class 3 nonemployee black applicants who applied for and were denied OTR positions prior to January 1, 1972 the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's denial of any form of seniority relief. Only this last aspect of the Court of Appeals' judgment is before us for review under our grant of the petition for certiorari. 420 U.S. 989, 95 S.Ct. 1421, 43 L.Ed.2d 669 (1975).\n\n\n5\n* Respondent Bowman raises a threshold issue of mootness. The District Court found that Bowman had hired petitioner Lee, the sole-named representative of class 3, and had subsequently properly discharged him for cause,4 and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Bowman argues that since Lee will not in any event be eligible for any hiring relief in favor of OTR nonemployee discriminatees, he has no personal stake in the outcome and therefore the question whether nonemployee discriminatees are entitled to an award of seniority when hired in compliance with the District Court order is moot. Bowman relies on Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975), and Board of School Comm'rs v. Jacobs, 420 U.S. 128, 95 S.Ct. 848, 43 L.Ed.2d 74 (1975). That reliance is misplaced.\n\n\n6\nSosna involved a challenge to a one-year residency requirement in a state divorce statute. The District Court properly certified the action as a class action. However, before the case reached this Court, the named representative satisfied the state residency requirement (and had in fact obtained a divorce in another State). 419 U.S., at 398, and n. 7, 95 S.Ct. at 557, 42 L.Ed.2d, at 540. Although the named representative no longer had a personal stake in the outcome, we held that \"(w)hen the District Court certified the propriety of the class action, the class of unnamed persons described in the certification acquired a legal status separate from the interest asserted by (the named representative),\" Id., at 399, 95 S.Ct., at 557, 42 L.Ed.2d, at 540, and, accordingly the \"cases or controversies\" requirement of Art. III of the Constitution was satisfied. Id., at 402, 95 S.Ct., at 559, 42 L.Ed.2d at 542.5\n\n\n7\nIt is true as Bowman emphasizes that Sosna was an instance of the \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\" aspect of the law of mootness. Id., at 399-401, 95 S.Ct., at 557, 42 L.Ed.2d., at 540. And that aspect of Sosna was remarked in Board of School Comm'rs v. Jacobs, supra, a case which was held to be moot.6 But nothing in our Sosna or Board of School Comm'rs opinions holds or even intimates that the fact that the named plaintiff no longer has a personal stake in the outcome of a certified class action renders the class action moot unless there remains an issue \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\"7 Insofar as the concept of mootness defines constitutionally minimal conditions for the invocation of federal judicial power, its meaning and scope, as with all concepts of justiciability, must be derived from the fundamental policies informing the \"cases or controversies\" limitation imposed by Art. III.\n\n\n8\n\"As is so often the situation in constitutional adjudication, those two words have an iceberg quality, containing beneath their surface simplicity submerged complexities which go to the very heart of our constitutional form of government. Embodied in the words 'cases' and 'controversies' are two complementary but somewhat different limitations. In part those words limit the business of federal courts to questions presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicial process. And in part those words define the role assigned to the judiciary in a tripartite allocation of power to assure that the federal courts will not intrude into areas committed to the other branches of government.\" Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 94-95, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1949-1950, 20 L.Ed.2d 947, 958-959 (1968).\n\n\n9\nThere can be no question that this certified class action \"clearly presented\" the District Court and the Court of Appeals \"with a case or controversy in every sense contemplated by Art. III of the Constitution.\" Sosna, supra, 419 U.S. at 398, 95 S.Ct., at 557, 42 L.Ed.2d, at 540. Those courts were presented with the seniority question \"in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicial process.\" Flast, supra, 392 U.S., at 95, 88 S.Ct., at 1950, 20 L.Ed.2d, at 958. The only constitutional mootness question is therefore whether, with regard to the seniority issues presented, \"a live controversy (remains) at the time this Court reviews the case.\" Sosna, supra, 419 U.S., at 402, 95 S.Ct., at 559, 42 L.Ed.2d, at 542.\n\n\n10\nThe unnamed members of the class are entitled to the relief already afforded Lee, hiring and backpay, and thus to that extent have \"such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy (whether they are also entitled to seniority relief) as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult . . . questions.\" Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 703, 7 L.Ed.2d 663, 678 (1962). Given a properly certified class action, Sosna contemplates that mootness turns on whether, in the specific circumstances of the given case at the time it is before this Court, an adversary relationship sufficient to fulfill this function exists.8 In this case, that adversary relationship obviously obtained as to unnamed class members with respect to the underlying cause of action and also continues to obtain as respects their assertion that the relief they have received in entitlement to consideration for hiring and backpay is inadequate without further award of entitlement to seniority benefits. This becomes crystal clear upon examination of the circumstances and the record of this case.\n\n\n11\nThe unnamed members of the class involved are identifiable individuals, individually named in the record. Some have already availed themselves of the hiring relief ordered by the District Court and are presently employed as OTR drivers by Bowman. Tr. of Oral Arg. 23. The conditions of that employment are now and so far as can be foreseen will continue to be partially a function of their status in the seniority system. The rights of other members of the class to employment under the District Court's orders are currently the subject of further litigation in that court. Id., at 15. No questions are raised concerning the continuing desire of any of these class members for the seniority relief presently in issue. No questions are raised concerning the tenacity and competence of their counsel in pursuing that mode of legal relief before this Court. It follows that there is no meaningful sense in which a \"live controversy\" reflecting the issues before the Court could be found to be absent.9 Accordingly, Bowman's mootness argument has no merit.\n\nII\n\n12\nIn affirming the District Court's denial of seniority relief to the class 3 group of discriminatees, the Court of Appeals held that the relief was barred by \u00a7 703(h) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(h). We disagree. Section 703(h) provides in pertinent part:\n\n\n13\n\"Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, it shall      not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to      apply different standards of compensation, or different      terms, conditions, or privileges of employment pursuant to a      bona fide seniority or merit system . . . provided that such      differences are not the result of an intention to      discriminate because of race, color, religion, sex, or      national origin . . . .\"\n\n\n14\nThe Court of Appeals reasoned that a discriminatory refusal to hire \"does not affect the bona fides of the seniority system. Thus, the differences in the benefits and conditions of employment which a seniority system accords to older and newer employees is protected (by \u00a7 703(h)) as 'not an unlawful employment practice'. 495 F.2d, at 417. Significantly, neither Bowman nor the unions undertake to defend the Court of Appeals' judgment on that ground. It is clearly erroneous.\n\n\n15\nThe black applicants for OTR positions composing class 3 are limited to those whose applications were put in evidence at the trial.10 The underlying legal wrong affecting them is not the alleged operation of a racially discriminatory seniority system but of a racially discriminatory hiring system. Petitioners do not ask for modification or elimination of the existing seniority system, but only an award of the seniority status they would have individually enjoyed under the present system but for the illegal discriminatory refusal to hire. It is this context that must shape our determination as to the meaning and effect of \u00a7 703(h).\n\n\n16\nOn its face, \u00a7 703(h) appears to be only a definitional provision; as with the other provisions of \u00a7 703, subsection (h) delineates which employment practices are illegal and thereby prohibited and which are not.11 Section 703(h) certainly does not expressly purport to qualify or proscribe relief otherwise appropriate under the remedial provisions of Title VII, \u00a7 706(g), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g), in circumstances where an illegal discriminatory act or practice is found. Further, the legislative history of \u00a7 703(h) plainly negates its reading as limiting or qualifying the relief authorized under \u00a7 706(g). The initial bill reported by the House Judiciary Committee as H.R. 715212 and passed by the full House on February 10, 1964,13 did not contain \u00a7 703(h). Neither the House bill nor the majority Judiciary Committee Report14 even mentioned the problem of seniority. That subject thereafter surfaced during the debate of the bill in the Senate. This debate prompted Senators Clark and Case to respond to criticism that Title VII would destroy existing seniority systems by placing an interpretive memorandum in the Congressional Record. The memorandum stated: \"Title VII would have no effect on established seniority rights. Its effect is prospective and not retrospective.\" 110 Cong.Rec. 7213 (1964).15 Senator Clark also placed in the Congressional Record a Justice Department statement concerning Title VII which stated: \"(I)t has been asserted that Title VII would undermine vested rights of seniority. This is not correct. Title VII would have no effect on seniority rights existing at the time it takes effect.\" Id., at 7207.16 Several weeks thereafter, following several informal conferences among the Senate leadership the House leadership, the Attorney General and others, see Vaas, Title VII: Legislative History, 7 B.C.Ind. & Com.L.Rev. 431, 445 (1966), a compromise substitute bill prepared by Senators Mansfield and Dirksen, Senate majority and minority leaders respectively, containing \u00a7 703(h) was introduced on the Senate floor.17 Although the Mansfield-Dirksen substitute bill, and hence \u00a7 703(h), was not the subject of a committee report, see generally Vaas, Supra, Senator Humphrey, one of the informal conferees, later stated during debate on the substitute that \u00a7 703(h) was not designed to alter the meaning of Title VII generally but rather \"merely clarifies its present intent and effect.\" 110 Cong.Rec. 12723 (1964). Accordingly, whatever the exact meaning and scope of \u00a7 703(h) in light of its unusual legislative history and the absence of the usual legislative materials, see Vaas, Supra, at 457-458, it is apparent that the thrust of the section is directed toward defining what is and what is not an illegal discriminatory practice in instances in which the post-Act operation of a seniority system is challenged as perpetuating the effects of discrimination occurring prior to the effective date of the Act. There is no indication in the legislative materials that \u00a7 703(h) was intended to modify or restrict relief otherwise appropriate once an illegal discriminatory practice occurring after the effective date of the Act is proved as in the instant case, a discriminatory refusal to hire. This accords with the apparently unanimous view of commentators, see Cooper & Sobol, Seniority and Testing Under Fair Employment Laws: A General Approach to Objective Criteria of Hiring and Promotion, 82 Harv.L.Rev. 1598, 1632 (1969); Stacy, Title VII Seniority Remedies in a Time of Economic Downturn, 28 Vand.L.Rev. 487, 506 (1975).18 We therefore hold that the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that, as a matter of law, \u00a7 703(h) barred the award of seniority relief to the unnamed class 3 members.\n\nIII\n\n17\nThere remains the question whether an award of seniority relief is appropriate under the remedial provisions of Title VII, specifically, \u00a7 706(g).19\n\n\n18\nWe begin by repeating the observation of earlier decisions that in enacting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress intended to prohibit all practices in whatever form which create inequality in employment opportunity due to discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin, Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 44, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 1017, 39 L.Ed.2d 147, 155 (1974); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 800, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1823, 36 L.Ed.2d 668, 676 (1973); Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 429-430, 91 S.Ct. 849, 852-853, 28 L.Ed.2d 158, 163-164 (1971), and ordained that its policy of outlawing such discrimination should have the \"highest priority,\" Alexander, supra, 415 U.S., at 47, 94 S.Ct. at 1019, 39 L.Ed.2d at 158; Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263, 1265 (1968). Last Term's Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975), consistently with the congressional plan, held that one of the central purposes of Title VII is \"to make persons whole for injuries suffered on account of unlawful employment discrimination.\" Id., at 418, 95 S.Ct., at 2372, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 297. To effectuate this \"make whole\" objective, Congress in \u00a7 706(g) vested broad equitable discretion in the federal courts to \"order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without back pay . . . , or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.\" The legislative history supporting the 1972 amendments of \u00a7 706(g) of Title VII20 affirms the breadth of this discretion. \"The provisions of (\u00a7 706(g)) are intended to give the courts wide discretion exercising their equitable powers to fashion the most complete relief possible. . . . (T)he Act is intended to make the victims of unlawful employment discrimination whole, and . . . the attainment of this objective . . .requires that persons aggrieved by the consequences and effects of the unlawful employment practice be, so far as possible, restored to a position where they would have been were it not for the unlawful discrimination.\" Section-by-Section Analysis of H.R. 1746, accompanying the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 Conference Report, 118 Cong.Rec. 7166, 7168 (1972). This is emphatic confirmation that federal courts are empowered to fashion such relief as the particular circumstances of a case may require to effect restitution, making whole insofar as possible the victims of racial discrimination in hiring.21 Adequate relief may be well be denied in the absence of a seniority remedy slotting the victim in that position in the seniority system that would have been his had he been hired at the time of his application. It can hardly be questioned that ordinarily such relief will be necessary to achieve the \"make-whole\" purposes of the Act.\n\n\n19\nSeniority systems and the entitlements conferred by credits earned thereunder are of vast and increasing importance in the economic employment system of this Nation. S. Slichter, J. Healy, & E. Livernash, The Impact of Collective Bargaining on Management 104-115 (1960). Seniority principles are increasingly used to allocate entitlements to scarce benefits among competing employees (\"competitive status\" seniority) and to compute noncompetitive benefits earned under the contract of employment (\"benefit\" seniority). Ibid. We have already said about \"competitive status\" seniority that it \"has become of overriding importance, and one of its major functions is to determine who gets or who keeps an available job.\" Humphrey v. Moore, 375 U.S. 335, 346-347, 84 S.Ct. 363, 370, 11 L.Ed.2d 370, 380 (1964). \"More than any other provision of the collective(-bargaining) agreement . . . seniority affects the economic security of the individual employee covered by its terms.\" Aaron, Reflections on the Legal Nature and Enforceability of Seniority Rights, 75 Harv.L.Rev. 1532, 1535 (1962). \"Competitive status\" seniority also often plays a broader role in modern employment systems, particularly systems operated under collective-bargaining agreements:\n\n\n20\n\"Included among the benefits, options, and safeguards      affected by competitive status seniority, are not only      promotion and layoff, but also transfer, demotion, rest days,      shift assignments, prerogative in scheduling vacation, order      of layoff, possibilities of lateral transfer to avoid layoff,      'bumping' possibilities in the face of layoff, order of      recall, training opportunities, working conditions, length of      layoff endured without reducing seniority, length of layoff recall rights will withstand, overtime opportunities, parking      privileges, and, in one plant, a preferred place in the      punch-out line.\" Stacy, 28 Vand.L.Rev., supra, at 490      (footnotes omitted).\n\n\n21\nSeniority standing in employment with respondent Bowman, computed from the departmental date of hire, determines the order of layoff and recall of employees.22 Further, job assignments for OTR drivers are posted for competitive bidding and seniority is used to determine the highest bidder.23 As OTR drivers are paid on a per-mile basis,24 earnings are therefore to some extent a function of seniority. Additionally, seniority computed from the company date of hire determines the length of an employee's vacation25 and pension benefits.26 Obviously merely to require Bowman to hire the class 3 victim of discrimination falls far short of a \"make whole\" remedy.27 A concomitant award of the seniority credit he presumptively would have earned but for the wrongful treatment would also seem necessary in the absence of justification for denying that relief. Without an award of seniority dating from the time when he was discriminatorily refused employment, an individual who applies for and obtains employment as an OTR driver pursuant to the District Court's order will never obtain his rightful place in the hierarchy of seniority according to which these various employment benefits are distributed. He will perpetually remain subordinate to persons who, but for the illegal discrimination, would have been in respect to entitlement to these benefits his inferiors.28\n\n\n22\nThe Court of Appeals apparently followed this reasoning in holding that the District Court erred in not granting seniority relief to class 4 Bowman employees who were discriminatorily refused transfer to OTR positions. Yet the class 3 discriminatees in the absence of a comparable seniority award would also remain subordinated in the seniority system to the class 4 discriminatees. The distinction plainly finds no support anywhere in Title VII or its legislative history. Settled law dealing with the related \"twin\" areas of discriminatory hiring and discharges violative of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 Et seq., provides a persuasive analogy. \"(I)t would indeed be surprising if Congress gave a remedy for the one which it denied for the other.\" Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 177, 187, 61 S.Ct. 845, 849, 85 L.Ed. 1271, 1279 (1941). For courts to differentiate without justification between the classes of discriminatees \"would be a differentiation not only without substance but in defiance of that against which the prohibition of discrimination is directed.\" Id., at 188, 61 S.Ct., at 850, 85 L.Ed., at 1280.\n\n\n23\nSimilarly, decisions construing the remedial section of the National Labor Relations Act, \u00a7 10(c), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c) the model for \u00a7 706(g), Albemarle Paper, 422 U.S., at 419, 95 S.Ct., at 2372, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 29729 make clear that remedies constituting authorized \"affirmative action\" include an award of seniority status, for the thrust of \"affirmative action\" redressing the wrong incurred by an unfair labor practice is to make \"the employees whole, and thus restor(e) the economic status quo that would have obtained but for the company's wrongful (act).\" NLRB v. Rutter-Rex Mfg. Co., 396 U.S. 258, 263, 90 S.Ct. 417, 420, 24 L.Ed.2d 405, 411 (1969). The task of the NLRB in applying \u00a7 10(c) is \"to take measures designed to recreate the conditions and relationships that would have been had there been no unfair labor practice.\" Carpenters v. NLRB, 365 U.S. 651, 657, 81 S.Ct. 875, 879, 6 L.Ed.2d 1, 5 (1961) (Harlan, J., concurring). And the NLRB has often required that the hiring of employees who have been discriminatorily refused employment be accompanied by an award of seniority equivalent to that which they would have enjoyed but for the illegal conduct. See, e. g., In re Phelps Dodge Corp., 19 N.L.R.B. 547, 600, and n. 39, 603-604 (1940), modified on other grounds, 313 U.S. 177, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271 (1941) (ordering persons discriminatorily refused employment hired \"without prejudice to their seniority or other rights and privileges\"); In re Nevada Consolidated Copper Corp., 26 N.L.R.B. 1182, 1235 (1940), enforced, 316 U.S. 105, 62 S.Ct. 960, 86 L.Ed. 1305 (1942) (ordering persons discriminatorily refused employment hired with \"any seniority or other rights and privileges they would have acquired, had the respondent not unlawfully discriminated against them\"). Plainly the \"affirmative action\" injunction of \u00a7 706(g) has no lesser reach in the district courts. \"Where racial discrimination is concerned, 'the (district) court has not merely the power but the duty to render a decree which will so far as possible eliminate the discriminatory effects of the past as well as bar like discrimination in the future.' \" Albemarle Paper, supra, 422 U.S., at 418, 95 S.Ct., at 2372, 45 L.Ed.2d at 297.\n\nIV\n\n24\nWe are not to be understood as holding that an award of seniority status is requisite in all circumstances. The fashioning of appropriate remedies invokes the sound equitable discretion of the district courts. Respondent Bowman attempts to justify the District Court's denial of seniority relief for petitioners as an exercise of equitable discretion, but the record is its own refutation of the argument.\n\n\n25\nAlbemarle Paper, supra, at 416, 95 S.Ct., at 2371, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 296, made clear that discretion imports not the court's \" 'inclination, but . . . its judgment; and its judgment is to be guided by sound legal principles.' \" Discretion is vested not for purposes of \"limit(ing) appellate review of trial courts, or . . . invit(ing) inconsistency and caprice,\" but rather to allow the most complete achievement of the objectives of Title VII that is attainable under the facts and circumstances of the specific case. 422 U.S., at 421, 95 Ct., at 2373, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 298. Accordingly, the District Court's denial of any form of seniority remedy must be reviewed in terms of its effect on the attainment of the Act's objectives under the circumstances presented by this record. No less than with the denial of the remedy of backpay, the denial of seniority relief to victims of illegal racial discrimination in hiring is permissible \"only for reasons which, if applied generally, would not frustrate the central statutory purposes of eradicating discrimination throughout the economy and making persons whole for injuries suffered through past discrimination.\" Ibid.\n\n\n26\nThe District Court stated two reasons for its denial of seniority relief for the unnamed class members.30 The first was that those individuals had not filed administrative charges under the provisions of Title VII with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and therefore class relief of this sort was not appropriate. We rejected this justification for denial of class-based relief in the context of backpay awards in Albemarle Paper, and for the same reasons reject it here. This justification for denying class-based relief in Title VII suits has been unanimously rejected by the courts of appeals, and Congress ratified that construction by the 1972 amendments. Albemarle Paper, supra, at 414 n. 8, 95 S.Ct., at 2370, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 294.\n\n\n27\nThe second reason stated by the District Court was that such claims \"presuppose a vacancy, qualification, and performance by every member. There is no evidence on which to base these multiple conclusions.\" Pet. forert. A54. The Court of Appeals rejected this reason insofar as it was the basis of the District Court's denial of backpay, and of its denial of retroactive seniority relief to the unnamed members of class 4. We hold that it is also an improper reason for denying seniority relief to the unnamed members of class 3.\n\n\n28\nWe read the District Court's reference to the lack of evidence regarding a \"vacancy, qualification, and performance\" for every individual member of the class as an expression of concern that some of the unnamed class members (unhired black applicants whose employment applications were summarized in the record) may not in fact have been actual victims of racial discrimination. That factor will become material however only when those persons reapply for OTR positions pursuant to the hiring relief ordered by the District Court. Generalizations concerning such individually applicable evidence cannot serve as a justification for the denial of relief to the entire class. Rather, at such time as individual class members seek positions as OTR drivers, positions for which they are presumptively entitled to priority hiring consideration under the District Court's order,31 evidence that particular individuals were not in fact victims of racial discrimination will be material. But petitioners here have carried their burden of demonstrating the existence of a discriminatory hiring pattern and practice by the respondents and, therefore, the burden will be upon respondents to prove that individuals who reapply were not in fact victims of previous hiring discrimination. Cf. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668, 677 (1973); Baxter v. Savannah Sugar Rfg. Corp., 495 F.2d 437, 443-444 (C.A. 5), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1033, 95 S.Ct. 515, 42 L.Ed.2d 308 (1974).32 Only if this burden is met may retroactive seniority if otherwise determined to be an appropriate form of relief under the circumstances of the particular case be denied individual class members.\n\n\n29\nRespondent Bowman raises an alternative theory of justification. Bowman argues that an award of retroactive seniority to the class of discriminatees will conflict with the economic interests of other Bowman employees. Accordingly, it is argued, the District Court acted within its discretion in denying this form of relief as an attempt to accommodate the competing interests of the various groups of employees.33\n\n\n30\nWe reject this argument for two reasons. First, the District Court made no mention of such considerations in its order denying the seniority relief. As we noted in Albemarle Paper, 422 U.S., at 421 n. 14, 95 S.Ct., at 2373, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 299, if the district court declines, due to the peculiar circumstances of the particular case, to award relief generally appropriate under Title VII, \"(i)t is necessary . . . that . . . it carefully articulate its reasons\" for so doing. Second, and more fundamentally, it is apparent that denial of seniority relief to identifiable victims of racial discrimination on the sole ground that such relief diminishes the expectations of other, arguably innocent, employees would if applied generally frustrate the central \"make whole\" objective of Title VII. These conflicting interests of other employees will, of course, always be present in instances where some scarce employment benefit is distributed among employees on the basis of their status in the seniority hierarchy. But, as we have said, there is nothing in the language of Title VII, or in its legislative history, to show that Congress intended generally to bar this form of relief to victims of illegal discrimination, and the experience under its remedial model in the National Labor Relations Act points to the contrary.34 Accordingly, we find untenable the conclusion that this form of relief may be denied merely because the interests of other employees may thereby be affected. \"If relief under Title VII can be denied merely because the majority group of employees, who have not suffered discrimination, will be unhappy about it, there will be little hope of correcting the wrongs to which the Act is directed.\" United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 446 F.2d 652, 663 (C.A. 2 1971).35 With reference to the problems of fairness or equity respecting the conflicting interests of the various groups of employees, the relief which petitioners seek is only seniority status retroactive to the date of individual application, rather than some form of arguably more complete relief.36 No claim is asserted that nondiscriminatee employees holding OTR positions they would not have obtained but for the illegal discrimination should be deprived of the seniority status they have earned. It is therefore clear that even if the seniority relief petitioners seek is awarded, most if not all discriminatees who actually obtain OTR jobs under the court order will not truly be restored to the actual seniority that would have existed in the absence of the illegal discrimination. Rather, most discriminatees even under an award of retroactive seniority status will still remain subordinated in the hierarchy to a position inferior to that of a greater total number of employees than would have been the case in the absence of discrimination. Therefore, the relief which petitioners seek, while a more complete form of relief than that which the District Court accorded, in no sense constitutes \"complete relief.\"37 Rather, the burden of the past discrimination in hiring is with respect to competitive status benefits divided among discriminatee and nondiscriminatee employees under the form of relief sought. The dissent criticizes the Court's result as not sufficiently cognizant that it will \"directly implicate the rights and expectations of perfectly innocent employees.\" Post, at 788. We are of the view, however, that the result which we reach today which, standing alone,38 establishes that a sharing of the burden of the past discrimination is presumptively necessary is entirely consistent with any fair characterization of equity jurisdiction,39 particularly when considered in light of our traditional view that \"(a)ttainment of a great national policy . . . must not be confined within narrow canons for equitable relief deemed suitable by chancellors in ordinary private controversies.\" Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U.S., at 188, 61 S.Ct., at 850, 85 L.Ed., at 1280.\n\n\n31\nCertainly there is no argument that the award of retroactive seniority to the victims of hiring discrimination in any way deprives other employees of indefeasibly vested rights conferred by the employment contract. This Court has long held that employee expectations arising from a seniority system agreement may be modified by statutes furthering a strong public policy interest.40 Tilton v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 376 U.S. 169, 84 S.Ct. 595, 11 L.Ed.2d 590 (1964) (construing \u00a7\u00a7 9(c)(1) and 9(c)(2) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, 1948, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7\u00a7 459(c)(1) and (2), which provided that a re-employed returning veteran should enjoy the seniority status he would have acquired but for his absence in military service); Fishgold v. Sullivan Drydock & Repair Corp., 328 U.S. 275, 66 S.Ct. 1105, 90 L.Ed. 1230 (1946) (construing the comparable provision of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940). The Court has also held that a collective-bargaining agreement may go further, enhancing the seniority status of certain employees for purposes of furthering public policy interests beyond what is required by statute, even though this will to some extent be detrimental to the expectations acquired by other employees under the previous seniority agreement. Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, 345 U.S. 330, 73 S.Ct. 681, 97 L.Ed. 1048 (1953). And the ability of the union and employer voluntarily to modify the seniority system to the end of ameliorating the effects of past racial discrimination, a national policy objective of the \"highest priority,\" is certainly no less than in other areas of public policy interests. Pellicer v. Brotherhood of Ry. & S.S. Clerks, 217 F.2d 205 (C.A.5 1954), cert. denied, 349 U.S. 912, 75 S.Ct. 601, 99 L.Ed. 1246 (1955). See also Cooper & Sobol, 82 Harv.L.Rev. at 1605.\n\nV\n\n32\nIn holding that class-based seniority relief for identifiable victims of illegal hiring discrimination is a form of relief generally appropriate under \u00a7 706(g), we do not in any way modify our previously expressed view that the statutory scheme of Title VII \"implicitly recognizes that there may be cases calling for one remedy but not another, and owing to the structure of the federal judiciary these choices are, of course, left in the first instance to the district courts.\" Albemarle Paper, 422 U.S., at 416, 95 S.Ct., at 2370, 45 L.Ed.2d at 295. Circumstances peculiar to the individual case may, of course, justify the modification or withholding of seniority relief for reasons that would not if applied generally undermine the purposes of Title VII.41 In the instant case it appears that all new hirees establish seniority only upon completion of a 45-day probationary period, although upon completion seniority is retroactive to the date of hire. Certainly any seniority relief ultimately awarded by the District Court could properly be cognizant of this fact. Amici and the respondent union point out that there may be circumstances where an award of full seniority should be deferred until completion of a training or apprenticeship program, or other preliminaries required of all new hirees.42 We do not undertake to delineate all such possible circumstances here. Any enumeration must await particular cases and be determined in light of the trial courts' \"keener appreciation\" of peculiar facts and circumstances. Albemarle Paper, supra, at 421-422, 95 S.Ct., at 2373, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 299.\n\n\n33\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the District Court's denial of seniority relief to class 3 is reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n34\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n35\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n36\nMr. Justice STEVENS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n37\nMr. Chief Justice BURGER, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\n38\nI agree generally with Mr. Justice POWELL, but I would stress that although retroactive benefit-type seniority relief may sometimes be appropriate and equitable, competitive-type seniority relief at the expense of wholly innocent employees can rarely, if ever, be equitable if that term retains traditional meaning. More equitable would be a monetary award to the person suffering the discrimination. An award such as \"front pay\" could replace the need for competitive-type seniority relief. See, Ante, at 777, n. 38. Such monetary relief would serve the dual purpose of deterring wrongdoing by the employer or union or both as well as protecting the rights of innocent employees. In every respect an innocent employee is comparable to a \"holder-in-due-course\" of negotiable paper or a bona fide purchaser of property without notice of any defect in the seller's title. In this setting I cannot join in judicial approval of \"robbing Peter to pay Paul.\"\n\n\n39\nI would stress that the Court today does not foreclose claims of employees who might be injured by this holding from securing equitable relief on their own behalf.\n\n\n40\nMr. Justice POWELL, with whom Mr. Justice REHNQUIST joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\n41\nI agree that this controversy is not moot, and that in the context of a duly certified class action the \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\" criterion discussed last Term in Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975), is only a factor in our discretionary decision whether to reach the merits of an issue, rather than an Art. III \"case or controversy\" requirement. I therefore concur in Part I of the Court's opinion.\n\n\n42\nI also agree with Part II of the opinion insofar as it determines the \"thrust\" of \u00a7 703(h) of Title VII to be the insulation of an otherwise bona fide seniority system from a challenge that it amounts to a discriminatory practice because it perpetuates the effects of pre-Act discrimination. Ante, at 761. Therefore, I concur in the precise holding of Part II, which is that the Court of Appeals erred in interpreting \u00a7 703(h) as a bar, in every instance, to the award of retroactive seniority relief to persons discriminatorily refused employment after the effective date of Title VII. Ante, at 762.\n\n\n43\nAlthough I am in accord with much of the Court's discussion in Parts III and IV, I cannot accept as correct its basic interpretation of \u00a7 706(g) as virtually requiring a district court, in determining appropriate equitable relief in a case of this kind, to ignore entirely the equities that may exist in favor of innocent employees. Its holding recognizes no meaningful distinction, in terms of the equitable relief to be granted, between \"benefit\"-type seniority and \"competitive\"-type seniority.1 The Court reaches this result by taking an absolutist view of the \"make whole\" objective of Title VII, while rendering largely meaningless the discretionary authority vested in district courts by \u00a7 706(g) to weigh the equities of the situation. Accordingly, I dissent from Parts III and IV.\n\n\n44\n* My starting point, as it is for the Court, is the decision last Term in Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975). One of the issues there was the standards a federal district court should follow in determining whether victims of a discriminatory employment practice should be awarded backpay. The Court began with an observation about the nature of backpay awards and other relief under \u00a7 706(g), the basic remedial section of Title VII:\n\n\n45\n\"It is true that backpay is not an automatic or mandatory      remedy; like all other remedies under the Act, it is one      which the courts 'may' invoke. The scheme implicitly      recognizes that there may be cases calling for one remedy but      not another, and owing to the structure of the federal      judiciary these choices are, of course, left in the first      instance to the district courts.\" 422 U.S., at 415-416, 95      S.Ct., at 2370-2371, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 295-296.\n\n\n46\nBackpay is the only remedy accompanying reinstatement that is mentioned specifically in Title VII. Moreover, as noted below, backpay is a remedy central to achieving the purposes of the Act. The Court in Albemarle, recognizing that equitable discretion under \u00a7 706(g) should not be left \"unfettered by meaningful standards or shielded from thorough appellate review,\" 422 U.S., at 416, 95 S.Ct. at 2371, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 296, required of district courts the \"principled application of standards (in determining backpay awards) consistent with (congressional) purposes,\" Id., at 417, 95 S.Ct., at 2371, 45 L.Ed.2d at 296. It identified two distinct congressional purposes implicit in Title VII. The \"primary objective\" was \"prophylactic\": \" 'to achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers that have operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of white employees over other employees.' \" Ibid., quoting Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 429-430, 91 S.Ct. 849, 852-853, 28 L.Ed.2d 158, 163-164 (1971). The second purpose was \"to make persons whole for injuries suffered on account of unlawful employment discrimination.\" 422 U.S., at 418, 95 S.Ct., at 2372, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 297. Because backpay served both objectives,2 The Court concluded that \"given a finding of unlawful discrimination, backpay should be denied only for reasons which, if applied generally, would not frustrate the central statutory purposes of eradicating discrimination throughout the economy and making persons whole for injuries suffered through past discrimination.\" Id., at 421, 95 S.Ct., at 2373, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 298-299.\n\n\n47\nThe Court today, relying upon Albemarle's holding as to the \"make whole\" purpose of Title VII, reasons that adequate relief for a victim of discrimination ordinarily will require \"slotting the victim in that position in the seniority system that would have been his had he been hired at the time of his application.\" Ante, at 765-766. Accordingly, the Court concludes that complete retroactive seniority should be treated like backpay and denied by a district court only for reasons which, applied generally, could not \"frustrate\" the congressional intent. Ante, at 771. Although the Court recognizes important differences between benefit-type seniority and competitive-type seniority, it expressly includes both in its conclusion that seniority relief presumptively should be available.3 For the reasons that follow, I think the Court's holding cannot be reconciled with 706(g) or with fundamental fairness.\n\nII\n\n48\nWhen a district court orders an award of backpay or retroactive seniority, it exercises equity powers expressly conferred upon it by Congress. The operative language of \u00a7 706(g) states that upon a finding of an unlawful employment practice the district court may enjoin the practice and, further, may\n\n\n49\n\"order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which      may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring      of employees, with or without back pay (payable by the      employer, employment agency, or labor organization, as the      case may be, responsible for the unlawful employment      practice), or any other equitable relief as the court deems      appropriate.\" 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(g) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).\n\n\n50\nThe last phrase speaking to \"other equitable relief\" was added by a 1972 amendment, Pub.L. No. 92-261, 86 Stat. 103. As noted in Albemarle, supra, at 420-421, 95 S.Ct., at 2372-2373, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 298-299, and again by the Court today, Ante, at 764, a Section-by-Section Analysis accompanying the Conference Report on that amendment stated that it was Congress' intention in \u00a7 706(g) \"to give the courts wide discretion exercising their equitable powers to fashion the most complete relief possible.\" 118 Cong.Rec. 7168 (1972).\n\n\n51\nThe expansive language of \u00a7 706(g) and the 1972 legislative history support a general directive to district courts to grant \"make whole\" relief liberally and not refuse it arbitrarily. There is nothing in either of those sources, however, to suggest that rectifying economic losses from past wrongs requires the district courts to disregard normal equitable considerations. Indeed, such a requirement is belied by the language of the statute itself, which speaks of \"such affirmative action as may be appropriate\" and such \"equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.\" The Section-by-Section Analysis similarly recognized that in fashioning \"the most complete relief possible\" the court still is to exercise \"equitable powers.\" But in holding that a district court in the usual case should order full retroactive seniority as a remedy for a discriminatory refusal to hire without regard to the effect upon innocent employees hired in the interim, the Court to a significant extent strips the district courts of the equity powers vested in them by Congress.\n\nIII\nA.\n\n52\nIn Albemarle Paper the Court read Title VII as creating a presumption in favor of backpay. Rather than limiting the power of district courts to do equity, the presumption insures that complete equity normally will be accomplished. Backpay forces the employer4 to account for economic benefits that he wrongfully has denied the victim of discrimination. The statutory purposes and equitable principles converge, for requiring payment of wrongfully withheld wages deters further wrongdoing at the same time that their restitution to the victim helps make him whole.\n\n\n53\nSimilarly, to the extent that the Court today finds a like presumption in favor of granting Benefit-type seniority, it is recognizing that normally this relief also will be equitable. As the Court notes, Ante, at 773 n. 33, this type of seniority, which determines pension rights, length of vacations, size of insurance coverage and unemployment benefits, and the like, is analogous to backpay in that its retroactive grant serves \"the mutually reinforcing effect of the dual purposes of Title VII,\" Ante, at 767 n. 27. Benefit-type seniority, like backpay, serves to work complete equity by penalizing the wrongdoer economically at the same time that it tends to make whole the one who was wronged.\n\n\n54\nBut the Court fails to recognize that a retroactive grant of Competitive-type seniority invokes wholly different considerations. This is the type of seniority that determines an employee's preferential rights to various economic advantages at the expense of other employees. These normally include the order of layoff and recall of employees, job and trip assignments, and consideration for promotion.\n\n\n55\nIt is true, of course, that the retroactive grant of competitive-type seniority does go a step further in \"making whole\" the discrimination victim, and therefore arguably furthers one of the objectives of Title VII. But apart from extending the make-whole concept to its outer limits, there is no similarity between this drastic relief and the granting of backpay and benefit-type seniority. First, a retroactive grant of competitive-type seniority usually does not directly affect the employer at all. It causes only a rearrangement of employees along the seniority ladder without any resulting increase in cost.5 Thus, Title VII's \"primary objective\" of eradicating discrimination is not served at all,6 for the employer is not deterred from the practice.\n\n\n56\nThe second, and in my view controlling, distinction between these types of relief is the impact on other workers. As noted above, the granting of backpay and of benefit-type seniority furthers the prophylactic and make-whole objectives of the statute without penalizing other workers. But competitive seniority benefits, as the term implies, directly implicate the rights and expectations of perfectly innocent employees.7 The economic benefits awarded discrimination victims would be derived not at the expense of the employer but at the expense of other workers. Putting it differently, those disadvantaged sometimes to the extent of losing their jobs entirely are not the wrongdoers who have no claim to the Chancellor's conscience, but rather are innocent third parties.\n\n\n57\nAs noted above in Part II, Congress in \u00a7 706(g) expressly referred to \"appropriate\" affirmative action and \"other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.\" And the 1972 Section-by-Section Analysis still recognized that the touchstone of any relief is equity. Congress could not have been more explicit in leaving the relief to the equitable discretion of the court, to be determined in light of all relevant facts and circumstances. Congress did underscore \"backpay\" by specific reference in \u00a7 706(g), but no mention is made of the granting of other benefits upon ordering reinstatement or hiring. The entire question of retroactive seniority was thus deliberately left to the discretion of the district court, a discretion to be exercised in accordance with equitable principles.\n\n\n58\n\"The essence of equity jurisdiction has been the power of the      Chancellor to do equity and to mould each decree to the      necessities of the particular case. Flexibility rather than      rigidity has distinguished it. The qualities of mercy and      practicality have made equity the instrument for nice      adjustment and reconciliation between the public interest and      private needs as well as between competing private claims.\"      Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329-330, 64 S.Ct. 587,      592, 88 L.Ed. 754 (1944).\n\n\n59\n\"Moreover, . . . equitable remedies are a special blend of      what is necessary, what is fair, and what is workable. . . .\"      Lemon v. Kurtzman, 411 U.S. 192, 200, 93 S.Ct. 1463, 1469, 36      L.Ed.2d 151, 161 (1973) (opinion of Burger, C. J.).\n\n\n60\n\"In equity, as nowhere else, courts eschew rigid absolutes      and look to the practical realities and necessities      inescapably involved in reconciling competing interests . . .      .\" Id., at 201, 93 S.Ct., at 1469, 36 L.Ed.2d 161.\n\n\n61\nThe decision whether to grant competitive-type seniority relief therefore requires a district court to consider and weigh competing equities. In any proper exercise of the balancing process, a court must consider both the claims of the discrimination victims and the claims of incumbent employees who, if competitive seniority rights are awarded retroactively to others, will lose economic advantages earned through satisfactory and often long service.8 If, as the Court today holds, the district court may not weigh these equities much of the language of \u00a7 706(g) is rendered meaningless. We cannot assume that Congress intended either that the statutory language be ignored or that the earned benefits of incumbent employees be wiped out by a presumption created by this Court.9\n\nB\n\n62\nThe Court's concern to effectuate an absolutist conception of \"make whole\" should be tempered by a recognition that a retroactive grant of competitive-type seniority touches upon other congressional concerns expressed in Title VII. Two sections of the Act, although not speaking directly to the issue, indicate that this remedy, unlike bankpay and benefit-type seniority, should not be granted automatically.\n\n\n63\nThe first section, \u00a7 703(h), has been discussed in the Court's opinion. As there noted, the \"thrust\" of that section is the validation of seniority plans in existence on the effective date of Title VII. The congressional debates leading to the introduction of \u00a7 703(h) indicate a concern that Title VII not be construed as requiring immediate and total restitution to the victims of discrimination regardless of cost in terms of other workers' legitimate expectations. Section 703(h) does not restrict the remedial powers of a district court once a discriminatory practice has been found, but neither are the concerns expressed therein irrelevant to a court's determination of \"appropriate\" equitable relief under \u00a7 706(g). Although the Court of Appeals read far too much into \u00a7 703(h), it properly recognized that the section does reflect congressional concern for existing rights under a \"bona fide seniority or merit system.\"\n\n\n64\nAlso relevant is \u00a7 703(j), which prohibits any interpretation of Title VII that would require an employer to grant \"preferential treatment\" to any individual because his race is underrepresented in the employer's work force in comparison with the community or the available work force.10 A grant of competitive seniority to an identifiable victim of discrimination is not the kind of preferential treatment forbidden by \u00a7 703(j) but, as counsel for the Steelworkers admitted at oral argument, it certainly would be \"preferential treatment.\"11 It constitutes a preference in the sense that the victim of discrimination henceforth will outrank, in the seniority system, the incumbents hired after the discrimination. Moreover, this is a preference based on a fiction, for the discrimination victim is placed ahead of others not because of time actually spent on the job but \"as if\" he had worked since he was denied employment. This also requires an assumption that nothing would have interrupted his employment, and that his performance would have justified a progression up the seniority ladder.12 The incumbents, who in fact were on the job during the interim and performing satisfactorily, would be seriously disadvantaged. The congressional bar to one type of preferential treatment in \u00a7 703(j) should at least give the Court pause before it imposes upon district courts a duty to grant relief that creates another type of preference.\n\nIV\n\n65\nIn expressing the foregoing views, I suggest neither that Congress intended to bar a retroactive grant of competitive-type seniority in all cases,13 nor that district courts should indulge a presumption against such relief.14 My point instead is that we are dealing with a congressional mandate to district courts to determine and apply equitable remedies. Traditionally this is a balancing process left, within appropriate constitutional or statutory limits, to the sound discretion of the trial court. At this time it is necessary only to avoid imposing, from the level of this Court, arbitrary limitations on the exercise of this traditional discretion specifically explicated in \u00a7 706(g). There will be cases where, under all of the circumstances, the economic penalties that would be imposed on innocent incumbent employees will outweigh the claims of discrimination victims to be made entirely whole even at the expense of others. Similarly, there will be cases where the balance properly is struck the other way.\n\n\n66\nThe Court virtually ignores the only previous judicial discussion directly in point. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, recently faced with the issue of retroactive seniority for victims of hiring discrimination, showed a fine appreciation of the distinction discussed above.  Meadows v. Ford Motor Co., 510 F.2d 939 (1975), cert. pending, No. 74-1349.15 That court began with the recognition that retroactive competitive-type seniority presents \"greater problems\" than a grant of backpay because the burden falls upon innocent incumbents rather than the wrongdoing employer. Id., at 949.16 The court further recognized that Title VII contains no prohibition against such relief. Then, noting that \"the remedy for the wrong of discriminatory refusal to hire lies in the first instance With the District Judge,\" Ibid. (emphasis added), the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stated:\n\n\n67\n\"For his guidance on this issue we observe . . . that a grant      of retroactive seniority would not depend solely upon the      existence of a record sufficient to justify back pay . . . .      The court would, in dealing with job (I. e.,      competitive-type) seniority, need also to consider the      interests of the workers who might be displaced . . . . We do      not assume . . . that such reconciliation is impossible, but      as is obvious, we certainly do foresee genuine difficulties.      . . .\" Ibid.\n\n\n68\nThe Sixth Circuit suggested that the District Court seek enlightenment on the questions involved in the particular fact situation, and that it should allow intervention by representatives of the incumbents who stood to be disadvantaged.17\n\n\n69\nIn attempted justification of its disregard of the explicit equitable mandate of \u00a7 706(g) the Court today relies almost exclusively on the practice of the National Labor Relations Board under \u00a7 10(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c).18 It is true that in the two instances cited by the Court, and in the few others cited in the briefs of the parties,19 the Board has ordered reinstatement of victims of discrimination \"without prejudice to their seniority or other rights and privileges.\" But the alleged precedents are doubly unconvincing. First, in none of the cases is there a discussion of equities either by the Board or the enforcing court. That the Board has granted seniority relief in several cases may indicate nothing more than the fact that in the usual case no one speaks for the individual incumbents. This is the point recognized by the court in Meadows, and the impetus for its suggestion that a representative of their interests be entertained by the district court before it determines \"appropriate\" \u00a7 706(g) relief.\n\n\n70\nI also suggest, with all respect, that the Court's appeal to Board practice wholly misconceives the lesson to be drawn from it. In the seminal case recognizing the Board's power to order reinstatement for discriminatory refusals hire, this Court in a reasoned opinion by Mr. Justice Frankfurter was careful to emphasize that the decision on the type and extent of relief rested in the Board's discretion, subject to limited review only by the courts.\n\n\n71\n\"But in the nature of things Congress could not catalogue all      the devices and stratagems for circumventing the policies of      the Act. Nor could it define the whole gamut of remedies to      effectuate these policies in an infinite variety of specific      situations. Congress met these difficulties by leaving the      adaptation of means to end to the empiric process of      administration. The exercise of the process was committed to      the Board, subject to limited judicial review. . . .\n\n\n72\n\". . . All these and other factors outside our domain of      experience may come into play. Their relevance is for the      Board, not for us. In the exercise of its informed discretion      the Board may find that effectuation of the Act's policies      may or may not require reinstatement. We have no warrant for      speculating on matters of fact the determination of which      Congress has entrusted to the Board. All we are entitled to      ask is that the statute speak through the Board where the      statute does not speak for itself.\" Phelps Dodge Corp. v.      NLRB, 313 U.S. 177, 194-196, 61 S.Ct. 845, 852-853, 85 L.Ed.      1271, 1283-1284 (1941) (emphasis added).\n\n\n73\nThe fallacy of the Court's reliance upon Board practice is apparent: the district courts under Title VII stand in the place of the Board under the NLRA. Congress entrusted to their discretion the appropriate remedies for violations of the Act, just as it previously had entrusted discretion to the Board. The Court today denies that discretion to the district courts, when 35 years ago it was quite careful to leave discretion where Congress had entrusted it. It may be that the district courts, after weighing the competing equities, would order full retroactive seniority in most cases. But they should do so only after determining in each instance that it is appropriate, and not because this Court has taken from them the power granted by Congress to weigh the equities.\n\n\n74\nIn summary, the decision today denying district courts the power to balance equities cannot be reconciled with the explicit mandate of \u00a7 706(g) to determine \"appropriate\" relief through the exercise of \"equitable powers.\" Accordingly, I would remand this case to the District Court with instructions to investigate and weigh competing equities before deciding upon the appropriateness of retroactive competitive-type seniority with respect to individual claimants.20\n\n\n\n1\n Petitioners also alleged an alternative claim for relief for violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. In view of our decision we have no occasion to address that claim.\n\n\n2\n In 1972, the International Union of District 50 merged with the United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO, and hence the latter as the successor bargaining representative is the union respondent before this Court. Brief for Respondent United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO, and for American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations as Amicus Curiae 5.\n\n\n3\n In conjunction with its directions to the District Court regarding seniority relief for the members of other subclasses not involved in the issues presently confronting this Court, the Court of Appeals directed that class 4 members who transferred to OTR positions under the District Court's decree should be allowed to carry over all accumulated company seniority for all purposes in the OTR department. 495 F.2d, at 417.\n\n\n4\n The District Court determined that Lee first filed his employment application with Bowman on January 13, 1970, and was discriminatorily refused employment at that time. Lee was later hired by Bowman on September 18, 1970, after he had filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The District Court awarded Lee $6,124.58 as backpay for the intervening period of discrimination.\n\n\n5\n \"There must not only be a named plaintiff who has such a case or controversy at the time the complaint is filed, and at the time the class action is certified by the District Court pursuant to Rule 23, but there must be a live controversy at the time this Court reviews the case. . . . The controversy may exist, however, between a named defendant and a member of the class represented by the named plaintiff, even though the claim of the named plaintiff has become moot.\" Sosna, 419 U.S., at 402, 95 S.Ct., at 559, 42 L.Ed.2d, at 542 (footnotes omitted).\n\n\n6\n In Board of School Comm'rs v. Jacobs, the named plaintiffs no longer possessed a personal stake in the outcome at the time the case reached this Court for review. As the action had not been properly certified as a class action by the District Court, we held it moot. 420 U.S., at 129, 95 S.Ct., at 850, 43 L.Ed.2d, at 78.\n\n\n7\n To the contrary, Sosna, 419 U.S., at 401 n. 10, 95 S.Ct., at 558, 42 L.Ed.2d, at 542, cited with approval two Courts of Appeals decisions not involving \"evading review\" issues which held, in circumstances less compelling than those presented by the instant case, that Title VII claims of unnamed class members are not automatically mooted merely because the named representative is determined to be ineligible for relief for reasons peculiar to his individual claim. Roberts v. Union Co., 487 F.2d 387 (C.A.6 1973); Moss v. Lane Co., 471 F.2d 853 (C.A.4 1973). In the Moss case, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit followed its prior decision in Brown v. Gaston County Dyeing Machine Co., 457 F.2d 1377, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 982, 93 S.Ct. 319, 34 L.Ed.2d 246 (1972). That case involved circumstances similar to those before us. There the named representative had proved his personal \u00a7 1981 claim against his former employer but was, for reasons special to himself, determined to be ineligible for the Title VII relief sought on behalf of himself and the class of discriminatees he represented.\n\n\n8\n Thus, the \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\" dimension of Sosna must be understood in the context of mootness as one of the policy rules often invoked by the Court \"to avoid passing prematurely on constitutional questions. Because (such) rules operate in 'cases confessedly within (the Court's) jurisdiction' . . . they find their source in policy, rather than purely constitutional, considerations.\" Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 97, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1951, 20 L.Ed.2d 947, 960 (1968). See also, Id., at 120 n. 8, 88 S.Ct. at 1963, 20 L.Ed.2d, at 973 (Harlan J., dissenting); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288, 345-348, 56 S.Ct. 466, 482-484, 80 L.Ed. 688, 709-712 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).\n\n\n9\n Nor are there present in the instant case nonconstitutional policy considerations, n. 8, Supra, mitigating against review by this Court at the present time. Indeed, to \"split up\" the underlying case and require that the individual class members begin anew litigation on the sole issue of seniority relief would be destructive of the ends of judicial economy and would postpone indefinitely relief which under the law may already be long overdue.\n\n\n10\n By its terms, the judgment of the District Court runs to all black applicants for OTR positions prior to January 1, 1972, and is not qualified by a limitation that the discriminatory refusal to hire must have taken place after the effective date of the Act. However, only post-Act victims of racial discrimination are members of class 3. Title VII's prohibition on racial discrimination in hiring became effective on July 2, 1965, one year after the date of its enactment. Pub.L. 88-352, \u00a7\u00a7 716(a)-(b), 78 Stat. 266. Petitioners sought relief in this case for identifiable applicants for OTR positions \"whose applications were put in evidence at the trial.\" App. 20a. There were 206 unhired black applicants prior to January 1, 1972, whose written applications are summarized in the record and none of the applications relates to years prior to 1970. Id., at 52a, Table VA.\n\n\n11\n See Last Hired, First Fired Seniority, Layoffs, and Title VII: Questions of Liability and Remedy, 11 Col.J.L. & Soc.Prob. 343, 376, 378 (1975).\n\n\n12\n See H.R.Rep.No.914, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1964, p. 2355 (1963).\n\n\n13\n 110 Cong.Rec. 2804 (1964).\n\n\n14\n H.R.Rep.No.914, Supra.\n\n\n15\n The full text of the memorandum pertaining to seniority states:\n\"Title VII would have no effect on established seniority rights. Its effect is prospective and not retrospective. Thus, for example, if a business has been discriminating in the past and as a result has an all-white working force, when the title comes into effect the employer's obligation would be simply to fill future vacancies on a nondiscriminatory basis. He would not be obliged or indeed, permitted to fire whites in order to hire Negroes, or to prefer Negroes for future vacancies, or, once Negroes are hired, to give them special seniority rights at the expense of the white workers hired earlier. (However, where waiting lists for employment or training are, prior to the effective date of the title, maintained on a discriminatory basis, the use of such lists after the title takes effect may be held an unlawful subterfuge to accomplish discrimination.)\"\n\n\n16\n The full text of the statement pertinent to seniority reads:\n\"First, it has been asserted that title VII would undermine vested rights of seniority. This is not correct. Title VII would have no effect on seniority rights existing at the time it takes effect. If, for example, a collective bargaining contract provides that in the event of layoffs, those who were hired last must be laid off first, such a provision would not be affected in the least by title VII. This would be true even in the case where owing to discrimination prior to the effective date of the title, white workers had more seniority than Negroes. Title VII is directed at discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. It is perfectly clear that when a worker is laid off or denied a chance for promotion because under established seniority rules he is 'low man on the totem pole' he is not being discriminated against because of his race. Of course, if the seniority rule itself is discriminatory, it would be unlawful under title VII. If a rule were to state that all Negroes must be laid off before any white man, such a rule could not serve as the basis for a discharge subsequent to the effective date of the title. I do not know how anyone could quarrel with such a result. But, in the ordinary case, assuming that seniority rights were built up over a period of time during which Negroes were not hired, these rights would not be set aside by the taking effect of title VII. Employers and labor organizations would simply be under a duty not to discriminate against Negroes because of their race. Any differences in treatment based on established seniority rights would not be based on race and would not be forbidden by the title.\" 110 Cong.Rec. 7207 (1964).\nSenator Clark also introduced into the Congressional Record a set of answers to a series of questions propounded by Senator Dirksen. Two of these questions and answers are pertinent to the issue of seniority:\n\"Question. Would the same situation prevail in respect to promotions, when that management function is governed by a labor contract calling for promotions on the basis of seniority? What of dismissals? Normally, labor contracts call for 'last hired, first fired.' If the last hired are Negroes, is the employer discriminating if his contract requires they be first fired and the remaining employees are white?\n\"Answer. Seniority rights are in no way affected by the bill. If under a 'last hired, first fired' agreement a Negro happens to be the 'last hired,' he can still be 'first fired' as long as it is done because of his status as 'last hired' and not because of his race.\n\"Question. If an employer is directed to abolish his employment list because of discrimination what happens to seniority?\n\"Answer. The bill is not retroactive, and it will not require an employer to change existing seniority lists.\" Id., at 7217.\n\n\n17\n Id., at 11926, 11931.\n\n\n18\n Cf. Gould, Employment Security, Seniority and Race: The Role of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 13 How.L.J. 1, 8-9, and n. 32 (1967); see also Jurinko v. Edwin L. Wiegand Co., 477 F.2d 1038 (C.A.3), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 414 U.S. 970, 94 S.Ct. 293, 38 L.Ed.2d 214 (1973), wherein the court awarded back seniority in a case of discriminatory hiring after the effective date of Title VII without any discussion of the impact of \u00a7 703(h) on the propriety of such a remedy.\n\n\n19\n Section 706(g) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g) (1970 ed., Supp. IV), provides:\n\"If the court finds that the respondent has intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in an unlawful employment practice charged in the complaint, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful employment practice, and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without back pay (payable by the employer, employment agency, or labor organization, as the case may be, responsible for the unlawful employment practice), or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate. Back pay liability shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to the filing of a charge with the Commission. Interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable. No order of the court shall require the admission or reinstatement of an individual as a member of a union, or the hiring, reinstatement, or promotion of an individual as an employee, or the payment to him of any back pay, if such individual was refused admission, suspended, or expelled, or was refused employment or advancement or was suspended or discharged for any reason other than discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin or in violation of section 2000e-3(a) of this title.\"\n\n\n20\n Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 103, amending 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e Et seq.\n\n\n21\n It is true that backpay is the only remedy specifically mentioned in \u00a7 706(g). But to draw from this fact and other sections of the statute, Post, at 789-793, any implicit statement by Congress that seniority relief is a prohibited, or at least less available, form of remedy is not warranted. Indeed, any such contention necessarily disregards the extensive legislative history underlying the 1972 amendments to Title VII. The 1972 amendments added the phrase speaking to \"other equitable relief\" in \u00a7 706(g). The Senate Report manifested an explicit concern with the \"earnings gap\" presently existing between black and white employees in American society. S.Rep.No. 92-415, p. 6 (1971). The Reports of both Houses of Congress indicated that \"rightful place\" was the intended objective of Title VII and the relief accorded thereunder. Ibid.; H.R.Rep.No. 92-238, p. 4 (1971), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1972, p. 2137. As indicated, Infra, at 767-768, and n. 28, rightful-place seniority, implicating an employee's\nFuture earnings, job security, and advancement prospects, is absolutely essential to obtaining this congressionally mandated goal.\nThe legislative history underlying the 1972 amendments completely answers the argument that Congress somehow intended seniority relief to be less available in pursuit of this goal. In explaining the need for the 1972 amendments, the Senate Report stated:\n\"Employment discrimination as viewed today is a . . . complex and pervasive phenomenon. Experts familiar with the subject now generally describe the problem in terms of 'systems' and 'effects' rather than simply intentional wrongs, and the literature on the subject is replete with discussions of, for example, the mechanics of seniority and lines of progression, perpetuation of the present effect of pre-act discriminatory practices through various institutional devices, and testing and validation requirements.\" S.Rep.No. 92-415, Supra, at 5.\nSee also H.R.Rep.No. 92-238, Supra, at 8. In the context of this express reference to seniority, the Reports of both Houses cite with approval decisions of the lower federal courts which granted forms of retroactive \"rightful place\" seniority relief. S.Rep.No. 92-415, Supra, at 5 n. 1; H.R.Rep.No. 92-238, Supra, at 8 n. 2. (The dissent, Post, at 796-797, n. 18, would distinguish these lower federal court decisions as not involving instances of discriminatory Hiring. Obviously, however, the concern of the entire thrust of the dissent the impact of rightful-place seniority upon the expectations of other employees is in no way a function of the specific type of illegal discriminatory practice upon which the judgment of liability is predicated.) Thereafter, in language that could hardly be more explicit, the analysis accompanying the Conference Report stated:\n\"In any area where the new law does not address itself, or in any areas where a specific contrary intention is not indicated, it was assumed That the present case law as developed by the courts would continue to govern the applicability and construction of Title VII.\" Section-By-Section Analysis of H.R.1746, accompanying The Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 Conference Report, 118 Cong.Rec. 7166 (1972) (emphasis added).\n\n\n22\n App. 46a-50a.\n\n\n23\n Ibid.\n\n\n24\n 2 Record 161.\n\n\n25\n App. 47a, 51a.\n\n\n26\n 2 Record 169.\n\n\n27\n Further, at least in regard to \"benefit\"-type seniority such as length of vacation leave and pension benefits in the instant case, any general bar to the award of retroactive seniority for victims of illegal hiring discrimination serves to undermine the mutually reinforcing effect of the dual purposes of Title VII; it reduces the restitution required of an employer at such time as he is called upon to account for his discriminatory actions perpetrated in violation of the law. See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 417-418, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 2371-2372, 45 L.Ed.2d 280, 296-297 (1975).\n\n\n28\n Accordingly, it is clear that the seniority remedy which petitioners seek does not concern only the \"make-whole\" purposes of Title VII. The dissent errs in treating the issue of seniority relief as implicating only the \"make whole\" objective of Title VII and in stating that \"Title VII's 'primary objective' of eradicating discrimination is not served at all . . . .\" Post, at 788. Nothing could be further from reality the issue of seniority relief cuts to the very heart of Title VII's primary objective of eradicating present and future discrimination in a way that backpay, for example, can never do. \"(S)eniority, after all, is a right which a worker exercises in each job movement in the future, rather than a simple one-time payment for the past.\" Poplin, Fair Employment in a Depressed Economy: The Layoff Problem, 23 U.C.L.A.L.Rev. 177, 225 (1975).\n\n\n29\n To the extent that there is a difference in the wording of the respective provisions, \u00a7 706(g) grants, if anything, broader discretionary powers than those granted the National Labor Relations Board. Section 10(c) of the NLRA authorizes \"such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this subchapter,\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c), whereas \u00a7 706(g) as amended in 1972 authorizes \"such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include, But is not limited to, reinstatement Or hiring of employees, with or without back pay . . . , Or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g) (1970 ed., Supp. IV) (emphasis added).\n\n\n30\n Since the Court of Appeals concluded that an award of retroactive seniority to the unnamed members of class 3 was barred by \u00a7 703(h), a conclusion which we today reject, the court did not address specifically the District Court's stated reasons for refusing the relief. The Court of Appeals also stated, however, that the District Court did not \"abuse its discretion\" in refusing such relief, 495 F.2d 398, 418 (1974), and we may therefore appropriately review the validity of the District Court's reasons.\n\n\n31\n The District Court order is silent as to whether applicants for OTR positions who were previously discriminatorily refused employment must be presently qualified for those positions in order to be eligible for priority hiring under that order. The Court of Appeals, however, made it plain that they must be. Id., at 417. We agree.\n\n\n32\n Thus Bowman may attempt to prove that a given individual member of class 3 was not in fact discriminatorily refused employment as an OTR driver in order to defeat the individual's claim to seniority relief as well as any other remedy ordered for the class generally. Evidence of a lack of vacancies in OTR positions at the time the individual application was filed, or evidence indicating the individual's lack of qualification for the OTR positions under nondiscriminatory standards Actually applied by Bowman to individuals who were in fact hired would of course be relevant. It is true, of course, that obtaining the third category of evidence with which the District Court was concerned what the individual discriminatee's job performance would have been but for the discrimination presents great difficulty. No reason appears, however, why the victim rather than the perpetrator of the illegal act should bear the burden of proof on this issue.\n\n\n33\n Even by its terms, this argument could apply only to the award of retroactive seniority for purposes of \"competitive status\" benefits. It has no application to a retroactive award for purposes of \"benefit\" seniority extent of vacation leave and pension benefits. Indeed, the decision concerning the propriety of this latter type of seniority relief is analogous, if not identical, to the decision concerning an award of backpay to an individual discriminatee hired pursuant to an order redressing previous employment discrimination.\n\n\n34\n With all respect, the dissent does not adequately treat with and fails to distinguish, Post, at 796-799, the standard practice of the National Labor Relations Board granting retroactive seniority relief under the National Labor Relations Act to persons discriminatorily discharged or refused employment in violation of the Act. The Court in Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 177, 196, 61 S.Ct. 845, 853, 85 L.Ed. 1271, 1284 (1941), of course, made reference to \"restricted judicial review\" as that case arose in the context of review of the policy determinations of an independent administrative agency, which are traditionally accorded a wide-ranging discretion under accepted principles of judicial review. \"Because the relation of remedy to policy is peculiarly a matter for administrative competence, courts must not enter the allowable area of the Board's discretion.\" Id., at 194, 61 S.Ct., at 852, 85 L.Ed., at 1283. As we made clear in Albemarle Paper, however, the pertinent point is that in utilizing the NLRA as the remedial model for Title VII, reference must be made to actual operation and experience as it has evolved in administrating the Act. E. g., \"We may assume that Congress was aware that the Board, since its inception, has awarded backpay as a matter of course.\" 422 U.S., at 419-420, 95 S.Ct., at 2372, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 298. \"(T)he Board has from its inception pursued 'a practically uniform policy with respect to these orders requiring affirmative action.' \" Id., at 2373 n. 12.\nThe dissent has cited no case, and our research discloses none, wherein the Board has ordered hiring relief and yet withheld the remedy of retroactive seniority status. Indeed, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has noted that a Board order requiring hiring relief \"without prejudice to . . . seniority and other rights and privileges\" is \"language . . . in the standard form which has long been in use by the Board.\" NLRB v. Draper Corp., 159 F.2d 294, 296-297, and n. 1 (1947). The Board \"routinely awards both back pay and retroactive seniority in hiring discrimination cases.\" Poplin, Supra, n. 28, at 223. See also Edwards & Zaretsky, Preferential Remedies for Employment Discrimination, 74 Mich.L.Rev. 1, 45 n. 224 (1975) (a \"common remedy\"); Last\nHired, First Fired Seniority, Layoffs and Title VII, Supra, n. 11, at 377 (\"traditionally and uniformly required\"). This also is a \"presumption\" in favor of this form of seniority relief. If victims of racial discrimination are under Title VII to be treated differently and awarded less protection than victims of unfair labor practice discrimination under the NLRA, some persuasive justification for such disparate treatment should appear. That no justification exists doubtless explains the position of every union participate in the proceedings before the Court in the instant case arguing for the conclusion we have reached.\n\n\n35\n See also Vogler v. McCarty, Inc., 451 F.2d 1236, 1238-1239 (C.A. 5 1971):\n\"Adequate protection of Negro rights under Title VII may necessitate, as in the instant case, some adjustment of the rights of white employees. The Court must be free to deal equitably with conflicting interests of white employees in order to shape remedies that will most effectively protect and redress the rights of the Negro victims of discrimination.\"\n\n\n36\n Another countervailing factor in assessing the expected impact on the interests of other employees actually occasioned by an award of the seniority relief sought is that it is not probable in instances of class-based relief that all of the victims of the past racial discrimination in hiring will actually apply for and obtain the prerequisite hiring relief. Indeed, in the instant case, there appear in the record the rejected applications of 166 black applicants who claimed at the time of application to have had the necessary job qualifications. However, the Court was informed at oral argument that only a small number of those individuals have to this date actually been hired pursuant to the District Court's order (\"five, six, seven, something in that order\"), Tr. of Oral Arg. 23, although ongoing litigation may ultimately determine more who desire the hiring relief and are eligible for it. Id., at 15.\n\n\n37\n In no way can the remedy established as presumptively necessary be characterized as \"total restitution,\" post, at 791, n. 9, or as deriving from an \"absolutist conception of 'make whole' \" relief. Post, at 791.\n\n\n38\n In arguing that an award of the seniority relief established as presumptively necessary does nothing to place the burden of the past discrimination on the wrongdoer in most cases the employer the dissent of necessity addresses issues not presently before the Court. Further remedial action by the district courts, having the effect of shifting to the employer the burden of the past discrimination in respect of competitive-status benefits, raises such issues as the possibility of an injunctive \"hold harmless\" remedy respecting all affected employees in a layoff situation, Brief for Local 862, United Automobile Workers, as Amicus Curiae; the possibility of an award of monetary damages (sometimes designated \"front pay\") in favor of each employee and discriminatee otherwise bearing some of the burden of the past discrimination, ibid.; and the propriety of such further remedial action in instances wherein the union has been adjudged a participant in the illegal conduct. Brief for United States et al. as Amici Curiae. Such issues are not presented by the record before us, and we intimate no view regarding them.\n\n\n39\n \" 'The qualities of mercy and practicality have made equity the instrument for nice adjustment and reconciliation between the public interest and private needs as well as between competing private claims.' \" \" 'Moreover, . . . equitable remedies are a special blend of what is necessary, what is fair, and what is workable . . . .\n\" 'In equity, as nowhere else, courts eschew rigid absolutes and look to the practical realities and necessities inescapably involved in reconciling competing interests. . . .' \" Post, at 789-790.\n\n\n40\n \"(C)laims under Title VII involve the vindication of a major public interest . . . .\" Section-By-Section Analysis of H.R. 1746, accompanying the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 Conference Report, 118 Cong.Rec. 7166, 7168 (1972).\n\n\n41\n Accordingly, to no \"significant extent\" do we \"(strip) the district courts of (their) equity powers.\" Post, at 786. Rather our holding is that in exercising their equitable powers, district courts should take as their starting point the presumption in favor of rightful-place seniority relief, and proceed with further legal analysis from that point; and that such relief may not be denied on the abstract basis of adverse impact upon interests of other employees but rather only on the basis of unusual adverse impact arising from facts and circumstances that would not be generally found in Title VII cases. To hold otherwise would be to shield \"inconsisten(t) and capri(cious)\" denial of such relief from \"thorough appellate review.\" Albemarle Paper, 422 U.S., at 421, 416, 95 S.Ct., at 2373, 2371, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 299, 296.\n\n\n42\n Brief for United States et al. as Amici Curiae 26; Brief for Respondent United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO, and for American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations as Amicus Curiae 28 n. 32.\n\n\n1\n My terminology conforms to that of the Court, Ante, at 766. \"Benefit\"-type seniority refers to the use of a worker's earned seniority credits in computing his level of economic \"fringe benefits.\" Examples of such benefits are pensions, paid vacation time, and unemployment insurance. \"Competitive\"-type seniority refers to the use of those same earned credits in determining his right, relative to other workers, to job-related \"rights\" that cannot be supplied equally to any two employees. Examples can range from the worker's right to keep his job while someone else is laid off, to his right to a place in the punch-out line ahead of another employee at the end of a workday.\n\n\n2\n As to the prophylactic purpose, the Court stated:\n\"It is the reasonably certain prospect of a backpay award that 'provide(s) the spur or catalyst which causes employers and unions to self-examine and to self-evaluate their employment practices and to endeavor to eliminate, so far as possible, the last vestiges of an unfortunate and ignominious page in this country's history.' \" 422 U.S., at 417-418, 95 S.Ct., at 2371-2372, 45 L.Ed.2d at 296-297 (citations omitted).\nBackpay furthers the \"make whole\" purpose of the statute by replacing some of the economic loss suffered as a result of the employer's wrongdoing. See Id., at 418-420, 95 S.Ct., at 2372-2373, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 297-298.\n\n\n3\n \"Discretion is vested . . . to allow the most complete achievement of the objectives of Title VII that is attainable under the facts and circumstances of the specific case. . . . Accordingly, the District Court's denial of Any form of seniority remedy must be reviewed in terms of its effect on the attainment of the Act's objectives under the circumstances presented by this record.\" Ante, at 770-771. (emphasis added).\n\n\n4\n In an appropriate case, of course, Title VII remedies may be ordered against a wrongdoing union as well as the employer.\n\n\n5\n This certainly would be true in this case, as conceded by counsel for Bowman at oral argument. There the following exchange took place:\n\"QUESTION: How is Bowman injured by this action?\n\"MR. PATE (Counsel for Bowman): By seniority? By the grant of this remedy?\n\"QUESTION: Either way.\n\"MR. PATE: It is not injured either way and the company, apart from the general interest of all of us in the importance of the question, has no specific tangible interest in it in this case as to whether seniority is granted to this group or not. That is correct.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 42.\nIn a supplemental memorandum filed after oral argument, petitioners referred to this statement by Bowman's counsel and suggested that he apparently was referring to the competitive aspects of seniority, such as which employees were to get the best job assignments, since Bowman certainly Would be economically disadvantaged by the benefit-type seniority, such as seniority-related increases in backpay. I agree that in the context Bowman's counsel spoke, he was referring to the company's lack of a tangible interest, in whether or not competitive-type seniority was granted.\n\n\n6\n The Court in Albemarle noted that this primary objective had been recognized in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971). See 422 U.S., at 417, 95 S.Ct., at 2371, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 296; see also Supra, at 783. In Griggs, the Court found this objective to be \"plain from the language of the statute.\" 401 U.S., at 429, 91 S.Ct., at 853, 28 L.Ed.2d, at 163. In creating a presumption in favor of a retroactive grant of competitive-type seniority the Court thus exalts the make-whole purpose, not only above fundamental principles of equity, but also above the primary objective of the statute recently found to be plain on its face.\n\n\n7\n Some commentators have suggested that the expectations of incumbents somehow may be illegitimate because they result from past discrimination against others. Cooper & Sobol, Seniority and Testing under Fair Employment Laws: A General Approach to Objective Criteria of Hiring and Promotion, 82 Harv.L.Rev. 1598, 1605-1606 (1969). Such reasoning is badly flawed. Absent some showing of collusion, the incumbent employee was not a party to the discrimination by the employer. Acceptance of the job when offered hardly makes one an accessory to a discriminatory failure to hire someone else. Moreover, the incumbent's expectancy does not result from discrimination against others, but is based on his own efforts and satisfactory performance.\n\n\n8\n The Court argues that a retroactive grant of competitive-type seniority always is equitable because it \"divides the burden\" of past discrimination between incumbents and victims. Ante, at 776-777. Aside from its opacity, this argument is flawed by what seems to be a misperception of the nature of Title VII relief. Specific relief necessarily focuses upon the individual victim, not upon some \"class\" of victims. A grant of full retroactive seniority to an individual victim of Bowman's discriminatory hiring practices will place that person exactly where he would have been had he been hired when he first applied. The question for a district court should be whether it is equitable to place that individual in that position despite the impact upon all incumbents hired after the date of his unsuccessful application. Any additional effect upon the entire work force incumbents and the newly enfranchised victims alike of similar relief to still Earlier victims of the discrimination, raises distinctly different issues from the equity, vis-a-vis incumbents, of granting retroactive seniority to each victim.\n\n\n9\n Indeed, the 1972 amendment process which produced the Section-by-Section Analysis containing the statement of the Act's \"make whole\" purpose, also resulted in an addition to \u00a7 706(g) itself clearly showing congressional recognition that total restitution to victims of discrimination is not a feasible goal. As originally enacted, \u00a7 706(g) contained simply an authorization to district courts to order reinstatement with or without backpay, with no limitation on how much backpay the courts could order. In 1972, however, the Congress added a limitation restricting the courts to an award to a date two years prior to the filing of a charge with EEOC. While it is true that Congress at the same time rejected an even more restrictive limitation, see Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, supra, 422 U.S., at 420 n. 13, 95 S.Ct., at 2373, 45 L.Ed.2d, at 298, its adoption of any limitation at all suggests an awareness that the desire to \"make whole\" must yield at some point to other considerations.\n\n\n10\n Section 703(j), 78 Stat. 257, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(j), reads in full as follows:\n\"(j) Nothing contained in this subchapter shall be interpreted to require any employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee subject to this subchapter to grant preferential treatment to any individual or to any group because of the race, color, religion, sex, or national origin of such individual or group on account of an imbalance which may exist with respect to the total number or percentage of persons of any race, color, religion, sex, or national origin employed by any employer, referred or classified for employment by any employment agency or labor organization, admitted to membership or classified by any labor organization, or admitted to, or employed in, any apprenticeship or other training program, in comparison with the total number or percentage of persons of such race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in any community, State, section, or other area, or in the available work force in any community, State, section, or other area.\"\n\n\n11\n Tr. of Oral Arg. 33.\n\n\n12\n It is true, of course, that backpay awards and retroactive grants of benefit-type seniority likewise are based on the same fiction and the same assumption. In the case of those remedies, however, no innocent persons are harmed by the use of the fiction, and any uncertainty about whether the victim of discrimination in fact would have retained the job and earned the benefits is properly borne by the wrongdoer.\n\n\n13\n Nor is it suggested that incumbents have \"indefeasibly vested rights\" to their seniority status that invariably would foreclose retroactive seniority. But the cases cited by the Court for that proposition do not hold, or by analogy imply, that district courts operating under \u00a7 706(g) lack equitable discretion to take into account the rights of incumbents. In Tilton v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 376 U.S. 169, 84 S.Ct. 595, 11 L.Ed.2d 590 (1964), and Fishgold v. Sullivan Corp., 328 U.S. 275, 66 S.Ct. 1105, 90 L.Ed. 1230 (1946), the Court only confirmed an express congressional determination, presumably made after weighing all relevant considerations, that for reasons of public policy veterans should receive seniority credit for their time in military service. See 376 U.S., at 174-175, 84 S.Ct., at 599-600, 11 L.Ed.2d, at 593-594. In Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman, 345 U.S. 330, 73 S.Ct. 681, 97 L.Ed. 1048 (1953), the Court affirmed the authority of a collective-bargaining agent, presumably after weighing the relative equities, see Id., at 337-339, 73 S.Ct., at 685-687, 97 L.Ed., at 1057-1058, to advantage certain employees more than others. All I contend is that under \u00a7 706(g) a district court, like Congress in Tilton and Fishgold, and the bargaining agent in Huffman, also must be free to weigh the equities.\n\n\n14\n The Court, Ante, at 764 n. 21, suggests I am arguing that retroactive competitive-type seniority should be \"less available\" as relief than backpay. This is not my position. All relief not specifically prohibited by the Act is equally \"available\" to the district courts. My point is that equitable considerations can make competitive-type seniority relief less \"appropriate\" in a particular situation than backpay or other relief. Again, the plain language of \u00a7 706(g) compels careful determination of the \"appropriateness\" of each \"available\" remedy in a specific case, and does not permit the inflexible approach taken by the Court.\n\n\n15\n From the briefs of the parties it appears that Meadows is one of only three reported appellate decisions dealing with the question of retroactive seniority relief to victims of discriminatory hiring practices. In the instant case, of course, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held such relief barred by \u00a7 703(h). In Jurinko v. Edwin L. Wiegand Co., 477 F.2d 1038, vacated and remanded on other grounds, 414 U.S. 970, 94 S.Ct. 293, 38 L.Ed.2d 214 (1973), the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ordered the relief without any discussion of equitable considerations.\n\n\n16\n The Sixth Circuit noted that no equitable considerations stand in the way of a district court's granting retroactive benefit-type seniority. 510 F.2d, at 949.\n\n\n17\n One of the commentators quoted by the Court today has endorsed the evenhanded approach adopted by the Sixth Circuit: \"In fashioning a remedy, . . . the courts should consciously assess the costs of relief to All the parties in the case, and then tailor the decree to minimize these costs while affording plaintiffs adequate relief. The best way to do this will no doubt vary from case to case depending on the facts: the number of plaintiffs, the number of (incumbents) affected and the alternatives available to them, the economic circumstances of the industry.\" Poplin, Fair Employment in a Depressed Economy: The Layoff Problem, 23 U.C.L.A.L.Rev. 177, 202 (1975) (emphasis in original); see Id., at 224.\nAnother commentator has said that judges who fail to take account of equitable claims of incumbents are engaging in an \"Alice in Wonderland\" approach to the problem of Title VII remedies. See Rains, Title VII v. Seniority Based Layoffs: A Question of Who Goes First, 4 Hofstra L.Rev. 49, 53 (1975).\n\n\n18\n By gathering bits and pieces of the legislative history of the 1972 amendments, the Court attempts to patch together an argument that full retroactive seniority is a remedy equally \"available\" as backpay. Ante, at 764-765, n. 21. There are two short responses. First, as emphasized elsewhere, Supra, at 794 n. 14, no one contends that such relief is less Available, but only that it may be less Equitable in some situations. Second, insofar as the Court intends the legislative history to suggest some presumption in favor of this relief, it is irrefutably blocked by the plain language of \u00a7 706(g) calling for the exercise of Equitable discretion in the fashioning of Appropriate relief. There are other responses. As to the committee citations of lower court decisions and the Conference Report Analysis reference to \"present case law,\" it need only be noted that as of the 1972 amendments no appellate court had considered a case involving retroactive seniority relief to victims of discriminatory hiring practices. Moreover, the cases were cited only in the context of a general discussion of the complexities of employment discrimination, never for their adoption of a \"rightful place\" theory of relief. And by the terms of the Conference Report Analysis itself, the existing case law could not take precedence over the explicit language of \u00a7 706(g), added by the amendments, that told courts to exercise Equitable discretion in granting Appropriate relief.\nMoreover, I find no basis for the Court's statement that the Committee Reports indicated \"rightful place\" to be the objective of Title VII relief. In fact, in both instances cited by the Court the term was used in the context of a general comment that minorities were still \"far from reaching their rightful place in society.\" S.Rep.No. 92-416, p. 6 (1971). There was no reference to the scope of relief under \u00a7 706(g), or indeed even to Title VII remedies at all.\n\n\n19\n The respondent Steelworkers cited seven Board decisions in addition to those mentioned in the Court's opinion. Brief for Respondent United Steelworkers of America AFL-CIO, and for American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations as Amicus Curiae, 27 n. 31.\n\n\n20\n This is not to suggest that district courts should be left to exercise a standardless, unreviewable discretion. But in the area of competitive-type seniority, unlike backpay and benefit-type seniority, the twin purposes of Title VII do not provide the standards. District courts must be guided in each instance by the mandate of \u00a7 706(g). They should, of course, record the considerations upon which they rely in granting or refusing relief, so that appellate review could be informed and precedents established in the area.\nIn this case, for example, factors that could be considered on remand and that could weigh in favor of full retroactive seniority, include Bowman's high employee turnover rate and the asserted fact that few victims of Bowman's discrimination have indicated a desire to be hired. Other factors, not fully developed in the record, also could require consideration in determining the balance of the equities. I would imply no opinion on the merits and would remand for full consideration in light of the views herein expressed.\n\n\n","label":1}

SEAMANS, Jr., Secretary of the Air  Force, et al.\nNo. 5481.\nArgued Feb. 22, 1971.\nDecided March 23, 1971.\nRehearing Denied May 17, 1971.\n\nSee 402 U.S. 990, 91 S.Ct. 1671.\nSyllabus\nThe District Court for the District of Arizona did not have jurisdiction to entertain a habeas corpus application by an Air Force enlisted man in Arizona on temporary duty orders, as no custodian, neither the commanding officer at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia nor anyone in the chain of command, was a resident of Arizona. Pp. 488-492.\nAffirmed.\nHerbert Phillip Schlanger, pro se.\nSol. Gen. Erwin N. Griswold, for respondents.\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe sole question in this case is whether the District Court for the District of Arizona had jurisdiction to entertain on the merits petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus. He is an enlisted man who was accepted in the Airman's Education and Commissioning Program, an officer training project, and was assigned to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB), Ohio, 'with duty at Arizona State University' for training. While studying in Arizona and before completion of the course, he was removed from the program, allegedly for engaging in civil rights activities on the campus.\n\n\n2\nWhile he was seeking administrative relief through command channels, he was reassigned to Moody AFB, Georgia, to complete the remainder of his six-year reenlistment in a noncommissioned status. After exhausting those remedies he was given permissive temporary duty to attend Arizona State for study, this time by his superiors at Moody AFB under a different program called Operation Bootstrap, and at his own expense.1\n\n\n3\nThereafter2 he filed his application for habeas corpus in Arizona alleging that his enlistment contract had been breached and that he was being detained unlawfully. The District Court denied the application. The Court of Appeals affirmed on the basis of Jarrett v. Resor, 9 Cir., 426 F.2d 213. The case is here on a petition for certiorari which we granted. 400 U.S. 865, 91 S.Ct. 110, 27 L.Ed.2d 103.\n\n\n4\nThe respondents to this suit are the Secretary of the Air Force, the Commander of Moody AFB, and the Commander of the AF ROTC program on the Arizona State campus. The last respondent was the only one of the three present in Arizona and he had no control over petitioner who concededly was not in his chain of command, since petitioner was not in the AF ROTC program, but in Operation Bootstrap. The commanding officer at Moody AFB in Georgia did have custody and control over petitioner; but he was neither a resident of the Arizona judicial district nor amenable to its process.\n\n\n5\nIt is true, of course, that the commanding officer at Moody AFB exerted control over petitioner in the sense that his arm was long and petitioner was effectively subject to his orders and directions. There are cases which suggest that such control to establish custody may be adequate for habeas corpus jurisdiction even though the control is exercised from a point located outside the State, as long as the petitioner is in the district or the State. Donigian v. Laird, D.C., 308 F.Supp. 449. For reasons to be stated, we do not reach that question.\n\n\n6\nThe procedure governing issuance of the writ is provided by statute. The federal courts may grant the writ 'within their respective jurisdictions.' 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(a). While the Act speaks of 'a prisoner' (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)), the term has been liberally construed to include members of the armed services who have been unlawfully detained, restrained, or confined. Eagles v. United States ex rel. Samuels, 329 U.S. 304, 312, 67 S.Ct. 313, 317, 318, 91 L.Ed. 308. The Act extends to those 'in custody under or by color of the authority of the United States.' 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(1). The question in the instant case is whether any custodian, or one in the chain of command, as well as the person detained, must be in the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court.\n\n\n7\nIn Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U.S. 188, 68 S.Ct. 1443, 92 L.Ed. 1898, we held that it was not sufficient if the custodian alone be found in the jurisdiction where the persons detained were outside the jurisdiction3 and that jurisdiction over the respondent was territorial.4 The dissent in that case thought that the critical element was not where the applicant was confined but where the custodian was located; that if the custodian were in the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court, then appropriate relief could be effected.\n\n\n8\nWhichever view is taken of the problem in Ahrens v. Clark, the case is of little help here. For while petitioner is within the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court, the custodian the Commander of Moody AFB\u2014is not. In other words, even under the minority view in Ahrens v. Clark, the District Court in Arizona has no custodian within its reach against whom its writ can run. Hence, even if we assume that petitioner is 'in custody'5 in Arizona in the sense that he is subject to military orders and control which act as a restraint on his freedom of movement (Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236, 240, 83 S.Ct. 373, 375, 376, 9 L.Ed.2d 285), the absence of his custodian is fatal to the jurisdiction of the Arizona District Court. Cf. United States ex rel. Rudick v. Laird, 2d Cir., 412 F.2d 16, 21.\n\n\n9\nHad petitioner, at the time of the filing of the petition, been under the command of the Air Force officer assigned as liaison officer at Arizona State to supervise the Education and Commissioning Program, we would have a different question. We do not reach it nor do we reach any aspects of the merits, viz., whether, if petitioner be right in contending that his contract of enlistment was breached, habeas corpus is the appropriate remedy.\n\n\n10\nAffirmed.\n\n\n11\nMr. Justice HARLAN concurs in the result.\n\n\n12\nMr. Justice STEWART dissents.\n\n\n\n1\n Headquarters at Moody AFB assigned petitioner to temporary duty at Arizona State University. By its terms, the order 'permitted (petitioner) to proceed from Moody AFB, GA. to Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, effective on or about 4 June 1969 for approximately 70 days for the purpose of attending the University under Operation Bootstrap and then return to Moody AFB, GA.' The travel authorized was to be 'at no expense to the Government.'\nPetitioner attended Arizona State in the summer of 1969 and obtained his degree.\n\n\n2\n This action was started shortly after petitioner had obtained his degree at Arizona State and while he was still in Arizona.\n\n\n3\n Shortly thereafter Congress provided that a prisoner, no matter where held, could by motion invoke the jurisdiction of the sentencing court and be released on a showing that the sentence was unlawful. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. See United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 220, 72 S.Ct. 263, 272, 96 L.Ed. 232; Kaufman v. United States, 394 U.S. 217, 89 S.Ct. 1068, 22 L.Ed.2d 227.\nLater Congress made an exception to the jurisdictional requirement noted in Ahrens by allowing a state prisoner to seek habeas corpus in the district where he was sentenced, as well as in the district where he is confined, provided both are within the same State. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d) (1964 ed., Supp. V). As respects that amendment the Court said in Nelson v. George, 399 U.S. 224, 228 n. 5, 90 S.Ct. 1963, 1966, 26 L.Ed.2d 578:\n'The legislative history of the 1966 amendments to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d) (1964 ed., Supp. V) suggests that Congress may have intended to endorse and preserve the territorial rule of Ahrens to the extent that it was not altered by those amendments. See H.R.Rep.No.1894, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 1-2 (1966). See also S.Rep.No.1502, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. (1966).'\n\n\n4\n Although by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(e) (1964 ed., Supp. V), Congress has provided for nationwide service of process in a 'civil action in which each defendant is an officer or employee of the United States' the legislative history of that section is barren of any indication that Congress extended habeas corpus jurisdiction. That section was enacted to broaden the venue of civil actions which could previously have been brought only in the District of Columbia. See H.R.Rep.No.536, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 1; S.Rep.No.1992, 87th Cong., 2d Sess., 2. Though habeas corpus is technically 'civil,' it is not automatically subject to all the rules governing ordinary civil actions. See Harris v. Nelson, 394 U.S. 286, 89 S.Ct. 1082, 22 L.Ed.2d 281.\n\n\n5\n The concept of 'custody' has been an evolving one as Judge Northrop shows in Donigian v. Laird, D.C., 308 F.Supp. 449, 451. And see Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 64-66, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 1554, 1555, 20 L.Ed.2d 426. In Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236, 238, 240, 243, 83 S.Ct. 373, 374-377, 9 L.Ed.2d 285, we said: 'While limiting its availability to those 'in custody,' the statute does not attempt to mark the boundaries of 'custody' nor in any way other than by use of that word attempt to limit the situations in which the writ can be used. * * *\n'History, usage, and precedent can leave no doubt that, besides physical imprisonment, there are other restraints on a man's liberty, restraints not shared by the public generally, which have been thought sufficient in the English-speaking world to support the issuance of habeas corpus.\n'It (the Great Writ) is not now and never has been a static, narrow, formalistic remedy; its scope has grown to achieve its grand purpose\u2014the protection of individuals against erosion of their right to be free from wrongful restraints upon their liberty. While petitioner's parole releases him from immediate physical imprisonment, it imposes conditions which significantly confine and restrain his freedom; this is enough to keep him in the 'custody' of the members of the Virginia Parole Board within the meaning of the habeas corpus statute; if he can prove his allegations this custody is in violation of the Constitution, and it was therefore error for the Court of Appeals to dismiss his case as moot instead of permitting him to add the Parole Board members as respondents.'\n\n\n","label":0}

McALEXANDER, etc.\nNo. 130.\nArgued March 21, 1960.\nDecided April 18, 1960.\nRehearing Denied June 6, 1960.\n\nSee 363 U.S. 817, 80 S.Ct. 1245.\nMr. Joseph Forer, Washington, D.C., and Nels Peterson, Portland, Or., for petitioner.\nMr. Oscar H. Davis, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nThe petitioner sought relief from an order directing his deportation on the ground that as an alien he had become, after entering the United States, a member of the Communist Party within the meaning of the Act of October 16, 1918, as amended by \u00a7 22 of the Internal Security Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 987, 1006.1 The District Court, after hering, denied the petition, Niukkanen v. Boyd, 148 F.Supp. 106, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 9 Cir., 241 F.2d 938. Invoking Rowoldt v. Perfetto, 355 U.S. 115, 78 S.Ct. 180, 2 L.Ed.2d 140, decided after the order for his deportation, petitioner sought an administrative reconsideration of his status. Upon its denial by the Board of Immigration Appeals he began the judicial proceeding immediately before us for review. After a hearing, the District Court again denied his petition for relief and the Court of Appeals affirmed the order of the District Court. 9 Cir., 265 F.2d 825. The ultimate question is whether petitioner is subject to deportation under Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 74 S.Ct. 737, 98 L.Ed. 911, or is saved from it under Rowoldt v. Perfetto, supra. The determination of this issue turns on evaluation of the testimony before the District Court, in light of Galvan v. Press, supra, and Rowoldt v. Perfetto, supra. Such assessment largely depends on the credibility of the testimony on which the district judge based his judgment, particularly that of the petitioner himself, whom the judge saw and heard. An able judge found that petitioner in denying membership in the Communist Party, unlike Rowoldt who admitted membership, see 355 U.S., at pages 116\u2014117, 78 S.Ct. at page 181, but accounted for its innocence, 'perjured himself before, and I believe that he perjured himself today.' We cannot say that his findings, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, were clearly erroneous and do not support the conclusion of both the lower courts.\n\n\n2\nJudgment affirmed.\n\n\n3\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice BLACK, and Mr. Justice BRENNAN concur, dissenting.\n\n\n4\nPetitioner was born in Finland in 1908, came here when he was less than a year old and has resided here ever since. He is married to a native-born citizen; he served honorably in our Army; and he has no criminal record of any kind except for a petty offense, back in 1930.\n\n\n5\nThe evidence against petitioner was given by two witnesses who had once been Communists, one of whom petitioner swore he never knew. They testified that petitioner was a member of the Communist Party from 1937 to 1939 in Portland, Oregon. One of them testified that petitioner had assisted in the circulation of a paper, Labor New Dealer, which apparently was an organ of the Party. There was evidence he paid dues to the Party of 25 cents a month and that he attended both open and closed meetings of the Party. But even these two ex-Communists who appeared against petitioner said that there was no discussion of ways and means to overthrow the Government at those meetings, that only problems such as labor conditions, relief, and the like were discussed. One also swore that petitioner never advocated the overthrow of the Government. Petitioner's interest in the Party, according to one of these hostile witnesses, was as a result of 'the sufferings of the people in the depression'; and he was 'very sympathetic toward their welfare.' This witness agreed that petitioner was not an intellectual interested in 'theory' or 'political discussion.' His interests were 'in bread and butter topics of the day, what to do for unemployment and relief.' Nor had petitioner ever taught the Communist doctrine nor distributed its literature, except for the Labor New Dealer.\n\n\n6\nThese two ex-Communists testified that petitioner attended dances that the Party arranged in Portland. But they said he never held an office in the Party; nor was ever employed by the Party; nor was ever a 'functionary' in the sense of representing the Party. He attended a regional meeting at Aberdeen, Washington, where various speakers, according to one ex-Communist, gave 'glowing accounts' of their work for the Party, 'more or less fabricating' their achievements.\n\n\n7\nWe know from petitioner's lips that he was not acquainted with the conventional Communist literature; and nothing came from the lips of his accusers that denied it. One who reads the whole of this record cannot put it down without feeling that here is a man neither conspiratorial, dangerous, cunning, nor knowledgeable. Petitioner\u2014a painter by trade represents a microscopic element in the ranks of our labor force who was caught up in a movement whose ideology he did not understand and whose leaders spoke in terms of bread for the hungry, and jobs for the unemployed. He has recently earned about $4,000 a year; he bought a home for $3,100 (which is now worth from $6,000 to $6,500 subject to a $2,500 mortgage); and he has personal property, including a car, worth $2,000.\n\n\n8\nThis is the background against which the following testimony can be best understood.\n\n\n9\n'Q. In the Finnish Hall or anywhere else did you attend      Communist Party meetings? A. Well, if I said yes and if I      said no maybe I wouldn't be telling the truth, because I      really couldn't tell one way or the other. I went to meetings      there. Sometimes maybe they were Communist, and maybe they      wasn't. It could have been and maybe they wasn't.\n\n\n10\n'Q. Have you been a member of the Communist Party of the      United States or any branch or affiliate or organization by      that name or any similar name? A. Knowingly, I haven't, no.\n\n\n11\n'Q. Do you believe that membership in the Communist Party now      is a lawful political purpose? A. No. I can't answer      questions about that because I don't know. If Congress says      it is unlawful, it is unlawful. If it isn't, it isn't. I      don't know. If I got the question right, I don't know.\n\n\n12\n'Q. I am not trying to confuse you, * * * I am trying to           find out your feelings toward Communism. A. Naturally I           don't\u2014Communism or socialism, I don't care what party it           is here or any place else, if it has anything to do with           overthrowing the government by force and violence I           don't agree with it, no.\n\n\n13\n'Q. What was your impression of what the Communist Party was      trying to do? A. Well, the only thing I heard in those days      was more relief and more work, and I never heard anything      else; no violent overthrow of the Government, or anything of      that sort, but anyplace I went to meetings was always more      work and more food.\n\n\n14\n'Q. As far as you know, that was what the Communist Party      stood for during that period? A. I don't know if they stood      for that, but I never heard anything against it.'\n\n\n15\nThe case is on all fours with Rowoldt v. Perfetto, 355 U.S. 115, 78 S.Ct. 180, 2 L.Ed.2d 140. The 'solidity of proof' (id., 355 U.S. at page 120, 78 S.Ct. at page 183) required for the severe consequences of the deportation of a man who came here when he was less than one year old, whose only memory of life is in this land, and who has lived here over 50 years has not been met. The 'meaningful association' with the Party which the Rowoldt case requires (355 U.S. at page 120, 78 S.Ct. at page 183) simply has not been established here. In this case, as in Rowoldt, petitioner's association with the Party was 'wholly devoid of any 'political' implications.' 355 U.S. at page 120, 78 S.Ct. at page 183.\n\n\n16\nThe testimony of the two ex-Communists upon which petitioner is being banished has never been heard by a court. The only testimony taken by the District Court was that of the petitioner and his character witnesses. The district judge believed the witnesses against Niukkanen, by virtue of having read the same record that is now before this Court. His impression of their credibility can be no more reliable than our own. Certainly then his conclusion that petitioner 'perjured himself before, and * * * perjured himself today' does not preclude this Court's review of the evidence against him. Apart from that, the evidence would be far too meagre to establish the 'meaningful association' which we required in the Rowoldt case.\n\n\n17\nThe unanimity of all the finders of fact in the Rowoldt case (355 U.S. at page 119, 78 S.Ct. at page 182) that Rowoldt was a 'member' of the Party and his refusal to answer when asked in the deportation proceedings whether he had ever been a member of the Communist Party, did not stop us from declaring that 'the record before us is all too insubstantial to support the order of deportation.' 355 U.S. at page 121, 78 S.Ct. at page 184. The unanimity of the finders of fact in the present case should likewise be no barrier to our entry of a just decree. A man who has lived here for every meaningful month of his entire life should not be sent into exile for acts which this record reveals were utterly devoid of any sinister implication.\n\n\n\n1\n Now 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1251(a)(6)(C).\n\n\n","label":1}

Appellant, a widower, was denied an exemption because the statute offers no analogous benefit for widowers. He then sought a declaratory judgment in county Circuit Court, which held the statute violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Florida Supreme Court reversed, finding the classification 'widow' valid because it has a 'fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation' of reducing 'the disparity between the economic capabilities of a man and a woman.' Held:\n1. The challenged tax law is reasonably designed to further the state policy of cushioning the financial impact of spousal loss upon the sex for whom that loss imposes a disproportionately heavy burden.

A state tax law is not arbitrary although it 'discriminate(s) in favor of a certain class . . . if the discrimination is founded upon a reasonable distinction, or difference in state policy,' and the statute here is well within those limits. Pp. 355\u2014356.\n273 So.2d 72, affirmed.\nRuth Bader Ginsburg, New York City, for appellant.\nSydney H. McKenzie, III, Tallahassee, Fla., for appellees.\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nSince at least 1885, Florida has provided for some form of property tax exemption for widows.1 The current law granting all widows an annual $500 exemption, Fla.Stat. \u00a7 196.202 (Supp.1974 1975), F.S.A., has been essentially unchanged since 1941.2 Appellant Kahn is a widower who lives in Florida and applied for the exemption to the Date County Tax Assessor's Office. It was denied because the statute offers no analogous benefit for widowers. Kahn then sought a declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court for Dade County, Florida, and that court held the statute violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the classification 'widow' was based upon gender. The Florida Supreme Court reversed, finding the classification valid because it has a \"fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation,\"3 that object being the reduction of 'the disparity between the economic capabilities of a man and a woman.' Kahn appealed here, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257(2), and we noted probable jurisdiction, 414 U.S. 973, 94 S.Ct. 283, 38 L.Ed.2d 216. We affirmed.\n\n\n2\nThere can be no dispute that the financial difficulties confronting the lone woman in Florida or in any other State exceed those facing the man. Whether from overt discrimination or from the socialization process of a male-dominated culture, the job market is inhospitable to the woman seeking any but the lowest paid jobs.4 There are, of course, efforts under way to remedy this situation. On the federal level, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits covered employers and labor unions from discrimination on the basis of sex, 78 Stat. 253, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\u20142(a), (c), as does the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 77 Stat. 56, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d). But firmly entrenched practices are resistant to such pressures, and, indeed, data compiled by the Women's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor show that in 1972 a woman working full time had a median income which was only 57.9% of the median for males\u2014a figure actually six points lower than had been achieved in 1955.5 Other date point in the same direction.6 The disparity is likely to be exacerbated for the widow. While the widower can usually continue in the occupation which preceded his spouse's death, in many cases the widow will find herself suddenly forced into a job market with which she is unfamiliar, and in which, because of her former economic dependency, she will have fewer skills to offer.7\n\n\n3\nThere can be no doubt, therefore, that Florida's differing treatment of widows and widowers \"rest(s) upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation.\" Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 76, 92 S.Ct. 251, 254, quoting Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U.S. 412, 415, 40 S.Ct. 560, 561, 64 L.Ed. 989.\n\n\n4\nThis is not a case like Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 36 L.Ed.2d 583, where the Government denied its female employees both substantive and procedural benefits granted males 'solely . . . for administrative convenience.' Id., at 690, 93 S.Ct. at 1772 (emphasis in original).8 We deal here with a state tax law reasonably designed to further the state policy of cushioning the financial impact of spousal loss upon the sex for which that loss imposes a disproportionately heavy burden. We have long held that '(w)here taxation is concerned and no specific federal right, apart from equal protection, is imperilled, the States have large leeway in making classifications and drawing lines which in their judgment produce reasonable systems of taxation.' Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U.S. 356, 359, 93 S.Ct. 1001, 1003, 35 L.Ed.2d 351. A state tax law is not arbitrary although it 'discriminate(s) in favor of a certain class . . . if the discrimination is founded upon a reasonable distinction, or difference in state policy,' not in conflict with the Federal Constitution. Allied Stores v. Bowers, 358 U.S. 522, 528, 79 S.Ct. 437, 441, 3 L.Ed.2d 480. This principle has weathered nearly a century of Supreme Court adjudication,9 and it applies here as well. The statute before us is well within those limits.10\n\n\n5\nAffirmed.\n\n\n6\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting.\n\n\n7\nThe Court rejects widower Kahn's claim of denial of equal protection on the ground that the limitation in Fla.Stat. \u00a7 196.191((7) (1971), F.S.A., which provides an annual $500 property tax exemption to widows, is a legislative classification that bears a fair and substantial relation to 'the state policy of cushioning the financial impact of spousal loss upon the sex for which that loss imposes a disproportionately heavy burden.' Ante, at 355. In my view, however, a legislative classification that distinguishes potential beneficiaries solely by reference to their gender-based status as widows or widowers, like classifications based upon race,1 alienage,2 and national origin,3 must be subjected to close judicial scrutiny, because it focuses upon generally immutable characteristics over which individuals have little or no control, and also because gender-based classifications too often have been inexcusably utilized to stereotype and stigmatize politically powerless segments of society. See Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 93 S.Ct. 1764 (1973). The Court is not, therefore, free to sustain the statute on the ground that it rationally promotes legitimate governmental interests; rather, such suspect classifications can be sustained only when the State bears the burden of demonstrating that the challenged legislation serves overriding or compelling interests that cannot be achieved either by a more carefully tailored legislative classification or by the use of feasible, less drastic means. While, in my view, the statute serves a compelling governmental interest by 'cushioning the financial impact of spousal loss upon the sex for which that loss imposes a disproportionately heavy burden,' I think that the statute is invalid because the State's interest can be served equally well by a more narrowly drafted statute.\n\n\n8\nGender-based classifications cannot be sustained merely because they promote legitimate governmental interests, such as efficacious administration of government. Frontiero v. Richardson, supra, Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 92 S.Ct. 251 (1971). For 'when we enter the realm of 'strict judicial scrutiny,' there can be no doubt that 'administrative convenience' is not a shibboleth, the mere recitation of which dictates constitutionality. See Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969); Carrington v. Rash, 380 U.S. 89, 85 S.Ct. 775, 13 L.Ed.2d 675 (1965). On the contrary, any statutory scheme which draws a sharp line between the sexes, solely for the purpose of achieving administrative convenience, necessarily commands 'dissimilar treatment for men and women who are . . . similarly situated,' and therefore involves the 'very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the (Constitution) . . ..' Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S., at 77, 76, 92 S.Ct., at 254.' Frontiero v. Richardson, supra, 411 U.S., at 690, 93 S.Ct. at 1772. But Florida's justification of \u00a7 196.191(7) is not that it serves administrative convenience or helps to preserve the public fisc. Rather, the asserted justification is that \u00a7 196.191(7) is an affirmative step toward alleviating the effects of past economic discrimination against women.4\n\n\n9\nI agree that, in providing special benefits for a needy segment of society long the victim of purposeful discrimination and neglect, the statute serves the compelling state interest of achieving equality for such groups.5 No one familiar with this country's history of pervasive sex discrimination against women6 can doubt the need for remedial measures to correct the resulting economic imbalances. Indeed, the extent of the economic disparity between men and women is dramatized by the date cited by the Court, ante, at 353\u2014354. By providing a property tax exemption for widows, \u00a7 196.01(7) assists in reducing that economic disparity for a class of women particularly disadvantaged by the legacy of economic discrimination.7 In that circumstance, the purpose and effect of the suspect classification are ameliorative; the statute neither stigmatizes nor denigrates widowers not also benefited by the legislation. Moreover, inclusion of needy widowers within the class of beneficiaries would not further the State's overriding interest in remedying the economic effects of past sex discrimination for needy victims of that discrimination. While doubtless some widowers are in financial need, no one suggests that such need results from sex discrimination as in the case of widows.\n\n\n10\nThe statute nevertheless fails to satisfy the requirements of equal protection, since the State has not borne its burden of proving that its compelling interest could not be achieved by a more precisely tailored statute or by use of feasible, less drastic means. Section 196.191(7) is plainly overinclusive, for the $500 property tax exemption may be obtained by a financially independent heiress as well as by an unemployed widow with dependent children. The State has offered nothing to explain why inclusion of widows of substantial economic means was necessary to advance the State's interest in ameliorating the effects of past economic discrimination against women.\n\n\n11\nMoreover, alternative means of classification, narrowing the class of widow beneficiaries, appear readily available. The exemption is granted only to widows who complete and file with the tax assessor a form application establishing their status as widows. By merely redrafting that form to exclude widows who earn annual incomes, or possess assets, in excess of specified amounts, the State could readily narrow the class of beneficiaries to those widows for whom the effects of past economic discrimination against women have been a practical reality.\n\n\n12\nMr. Justice WHITE, dissenting.\n\n\n13\nThe Florida tax exemption at issue here is available to all widows but not to widowers. The presumption is that all widows are financially more needy and less trained or less ready for the job market than men. It may be that most widows have been occupied as housewife, mother, and homemaker and are not immediately prepared for employment. But there are many rich widows who need no largess from the State; many others are highly trained and have held lucrative positions long before the death of their husbands. At the same time, there are many widowers who are needy and who are in more desperate financial straits and have less access to the job market than many widows. Yet none of them qualifies for the exemption.\n\n\n14\nI find the discrimination invidious and violative of the Equal Protection Clause. There is merit in giving poor widows a tax break, but gender-based classifications are suspect and require more justification than the State has offered.\n\n\n15\nI perceive no purpose served by the exemption other than to alleviate current economic necessity, but the State extends the exemption to widows who do not need the help and denies it to widowers who do. It may be administratively inconvenient to make individual determinations of entitlement and to extend the exemption to needy men as well as needy women, but administrative efficiency is not an adequate justification for discriminations based purely on sex. Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 93 S.Ct. 1764 (1973); Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 92 S.Ct. 251 (1971).\n\n\n16\nIt may be suggested that the State is entitled to prefer widows over widowers because their assumed need is rooted in past and present economic discrimination against women. But this is not a credible explanation of Florida's tax exemption; for if the State's purpose was to compensate for past discrimination against females, surely it would not have limited the exemption to women who are widows. Moreover, even if past discrimination is considered to be the criterion for current tax exemption, the State nevertheless ignores all those widowers who have felt the effects of economic discrimination, whether as a member of a racial group or as one of the many who cannot escape the cycle of poverty. It seems to me that the State in this case is merely conferring an economic benefit in the form of a tax exemption and has not adequately explained why women should be treated differently from men.\n\n\n17\nI dissent.\n\n\n\n1\n Article IX, \u00a7 9, of the 1885 Florida Constitution provided that: 'There shall be exempt from taxation property to the value of two hundred dollars to every widow that has a family dependent on her for support, and to every person that has lost a limb or been disabled in war or by misfortune.'\n\n\n2\n In 1941 Fla.Stat. \u00a7 192.06(7) exempted '(p)roperty to the value of five hundred dollars to every widow . . ..' That provision has survived a variety of minor changes and renumbering in substantially the same form, including Fla.Stat. \u00a7 196.191(7) (1971) under which appellant was denied the exemption. Currently Fla.Stat. \u00a7 196.202 provides: 'Property to the value of five hundred dollars ($500) of every widow, blind person, or totally and permanently disabled person who is a bona fide resident of this state shall be exempt from taxation.'\n\n\n3\n Quoting Reed v.

Of those employed as managers or administrators, the women's median income was only 53.2% of the men's, and in the professional and technical occupations the figure was 67.5%.

But the issue, of course, is not whether the statute could have been drafted more wisely, but whether the lines chosen by the Florida Legislature are within constitutional limitations. The dissents would use the Equal Protection Clause as a vehicle for reinstating notions of substantive due process that have been repudiated.

In levying such taxes, the State is not required to resort to close distinctions or to maintain a precise, scientific uniformity with reference to composition, use, or value. To hold otherwise would be to subject the essential taxing power of the State to an intolerable supervision, hostile to the basic principles of our government and wholly beyond the protection which the general clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to assure.'

The disparity is likely to be exacerbated for the widow. While the widower can usually continue in the occupation which preceded his spouse's death, in many cases the widow will find herself suddenly forced into a job market with which she is unfamiliar, and in which, because of her former economic dependency, she will have fewer skills to offer.'

Benjamin Margolis, A. L. Wirin, Los Angeles, Cal., for Stack et al.\nMr. Philip B. Perlman, Sol. Gen., Washington, D.C., for Boyle, Marshal.\nMr. Chief Justice VINSON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nIndictments have been returned in the Southern District of California charging the twelve petitioners with conspiring to violate the Smith Act, 18 U.S.C. (Supp. IV) \u00a7\u00a7 371, 2385, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 2385. Upon their arrest, bail was fixed for each petitioner in the widely varying amounts of $2,500, $7,500, $75,000 and $100,000. On motion of petitioner Schneiderman following arrest in the Southern District of New York, his bail was reduced to $50,000 before his removal to California. On motion of the Government to increase bail in the case of other petitioners, and after several intermediate procedural steps not material to the issues presented here, bail was fixed in the District Court for the Southern District of California in the uniform amount of $50,000 for each petitioner.\n\n\n2\nPetitioners moved to reduce bail on the ground that bail as fixed was excessive under the Eighth Amendment.1 In support of their motion, petitioners submitted statements as to their financial resources, family relationships, health, prior criminal records, and other information. The only evidence offered by the Government was a certified record showing that four persons previously convicted under the Smith Act in the Southern District of New York had forfeited bail. No evidence was produced relating those four persons to the petitioners in this case. At a hearing on the motion, petitioners were examined by the District Judge and cross-examined by an attorney for the Government. Petitioners' factual statements stand uncontroverted.\n\n\n3\nAfter their motion to reduce bail was denied, petitioners filed applications for habeas corpus in the same District Court. Upon consideration of the record on the motion to reduce bail, the writs were denied. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 192 F.2d 56. Prior to filing their petition for certiorari in this Court, petitioners filed with Mr. Justice DOUGLAS an application for bail and an alternative application for habeas corpus seeking interim relief. Both applications were referred to the Court and the matter was set down for argument on specific questions covering the issues raised by this case.\n\n\n4\nRelief in this type of case must be speedy if it is to be effective. The petition for certiorari and the full record are now before the Court and, since the questions presented by the petition have been fully briefed and argued, we consider it appropriate to dispose of the petition for certiorari at this time. Accordingly, the petition for certiorari is granted for review of questions important to the administration of criminal justice.2\n\n\n5\nFirst. From the passage of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 91, to the present Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 46(a)(1), 18 U.S.C.A., federal law has unequivocally provided that a person arrested for a non-capital offense shall be admitted to bail. This traditional right to freedom before conviction permits the unhampered preparation of a defense, and serves to prevent the infliction of punishment prior to conviction. See Hudson v. Parker, 1895, 156 U.S. 277, 285, 15 S.Ct. 450, 453, 39 L.Ed. 424. Unless this right to bail before trial is preserved, the presumption of innocence, secured only after centuries of struggle, would lose its meaning.\n\n\n6\nThe right to release before trial is conditioned upon the accused's giving adequate assurance that he will stand trial and submit to sentence if found guilty. Ex parte Milburn, 1835, 9 Pet. 704, 710, 9 L.Ed. 280. Like the ancient practice of securing the oaths of responsible persons to stand as sureties for the accused, the modern practice of requiring a bail bond or the deposit of a sum of money subject to forfeiture serves as additional assurance of the presence of an accused. Bail set at a figure higher than an amount reasonably calculated to fulfill this purpose is 'excessive' under the Eighth Amendment. See United States v. Motlow, 10 F.2d 657 (1926, opinion by Mr. Justice Butler as Circuit Justice of the Seventh circuit).\n\n\n7\nSince the function of bail is limited, the fixing of bail for any individual defendant must be based upon standards relevant to the purpose of assuring the presence of that defendant. The traditional standards as expressed in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure3 are to be applied in each case to each defendant. In this case petitioners are charged with offenses under the Smith Act and, if found guilty, their convictions are subject to review with the scrupulous care demanded by our Constitution. Dennis v. United States, 1951, 341 U.S. 494, 516, 71 S.Ct. 857, 870, 95 L.Ed. 1137. Upon final judgment of conviction, petitioners face imprisonment of not more than five years and a fine of not more than $10,000. It is not denied that bail for each petitioner has been fixed in a sum much higher than that usually imposed for offenses with like penalties and yet there has been no factual showing to justify such action in this case. The Government asks the courts to depart from the norm by assuming, without the introduction of evidence, that each petitioner is a pawn in a conspiracy and will, in obedience to a superior, flee the jurisdiction. To infer from the fact of indictment alone a need for bail in an unusually high amount is an arbitrary act. Such conduct would inject into our own system of government the very principles of totalitarianism which Congress was seeking to guard against in passing the statute under which petitioners have been indicted.\n\n\n8\nIf bail in an amount greater than that usually fixed for serious charges of crimes is required in the case of any of the petitioners, that is a matter to which evidence should be directed in a hearing so that the constitutional rights of each petitioner may be preserved. In the absence of such a showing, we are of the opinion that the fixing of bail before trial in these cases cannot be squared with the statutory and constitutional standards for admission to bail.\n\n\n9\nSecond. The proper procedure for challenging bail as unlawfully fixed is by motion for reduction of bail and appeal to the Court of Appeals from an order denying such motion. Petitioners' motion to reduce bail did not merely invoke the discretion of the District Court setting bail within a zone of reasonableness, but challenged the bail as violating statutory and constitutional standards. As there is no discretion to refuse to reduce excessive bail, the order denying the motion to reduce bail is appealable as a 'final decision' of the District Court under 28 U.S.C. (Supp. IV) \u00a7 1291, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291. Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 1949, 337 U.S. 541, 545\u2014547, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1225\u20141226, 93 L.Ed. 1528. In this case, however, petitioners did not take an appeal from the order of the District Court denying their motion for reduction of bail. Instead, they presented their claims under the Eighth Amendment in applications for writs of habeas corpus. While habeas corpus is an appropriate remedy for one held in custody in violation of the Constitution, 28 U.S.C. (Supp. IV) \u00a7 2241(c)(3), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241(c)(3), the District Court should withhold relief in this collateral habeas corpus action where an adequate remedy available in the criminal proceeding has not been exhausted. Ex parte Royall, 1886, 117 U.S. 241, 6 S.Ct. 734, 29 L.Ed. 868; Johnson v. Hoy, 1913, 227 U.S. 245, 33 S.Ct. 240, 57 L.Ed. 497.\n\n\n10\nThe Court concludes that bail has not been fixed by proper methods in this case and that petitioners' remedy is by motion to reduce bail, with right of appeal to the Court of Appeals. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the case is remanded to the District Court with directions to vacate its order denying petitioners' applications for writs of habeas corpus and to dismiss the applications without prejudice. Petitioners may move for reduction of bail in the criminal proceeding so that a hearing may be held for the purpose of fixing reasonable bail for each petitioner.\n\n\n11\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n12\nJudgment of Court of Appeals vacated and case remanded to District Court with directions.\n\n\n13\nMr. Justice MINTON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n14\nBy Mr. Justice JACKSON, whom Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER joins.\n\n\n15\nI think the principles governing allowance of bail have been misunderstood or too casually applied in these cases and that they should be returned to the Circuit Justice or the District Courts for reconsideration in the light of standards which it is our function to determine. We have heard the parties on only four specific questions relating to bail before conviction\u2014two involving considerations of law and of fact which should determine the amount of bail, and two relating to the procedure for correcting any departure therefrom. I consider first the principles which govern release of accused persons upon bail pending their trial.\n\n\n16\nThe practice of admission to bail, as it has evolved in Anglo-American law, is not a device for keeping persons in jail upon mere accusation until it is found convenient to give them a trial. On the contrary, the spirit of the procedure is to enable them to stay out of jail until a trial has found them guilty. Without this conditional privilege, even those wrongly accused are punished by a period of imprisonment while awaiting trial and are handicapped in consulting counsel, searching for evidence and witnesses, and preparing a defense. To open a way of escape from this handicap and possible injustice, Congress commands allowance of bail for one under charge of any offense not punishable by death, Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. 46(a)(1) providing: 'A person arrested for an offense not punishable by death shall be admitted to bail * * *' before conviction.\n\n\n17\nAdmission to bail always involves a risk that the accused will take flight. That is a calculated risk which the law takes as the price of our system of justice. We know that Congress anticipated that bail would enable some escapes, because it provided a procedure for dealing with them. Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. 46(f).\n\n\n18\nIn allowance of bail, the duty of the judge is to reduce the risk by fixing an amount reasonably calculated to hold the accused available for trial and its consequence. Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. 46(c). But the judge is not free to make the sky the limit, because the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution says: 'Excessive bail shall not be required * * *.'\n\n\n19\nCongress has reduced this generality in providing more precise standards, stating that '* * * the amount thereof shall be such as in the judgment of the commissioner or court or judge or justice will insure the presence of the defendant, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offense charged, the weight of the evidence against him, the financial ability of the defendant to give bail and the character of the defendant.' Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. 46(c).\n\n\n20\nThese statutory standards are not challenged as unconstitutional, rather the amounts of bail established for these petitioners are alleged to exceed these standards. We submitted no constitutional questions to argument by the parties, and it is our duty to avoid constitutional issues if possible. For me, the record is inadequate to say what amounts would be reasonable in any particular one of these cases and I regard it as not the function of this Court to do so. Furthermore, the whole Court agrees that the remedy pursued in the circumstances of this case is inappropriate to test the question and bring it here. But I do think there is a fair showing that these congressionally enacted standards have not been correctly applied.\n\n\n21\nIt is complained that the District Court fixed a uniform blanket bail chiefly by consideration of the nature of the accusation and did not take into account the difference in circumstances between different defendants. If this occurred, it is a clear violation of Rule 46(c). Each defendant stands before the bar of justice as an individual. Even on a conspiracy charge defendants do not lose their separateness or identity. While it might be possible that these defendants are identical in financial ability, character and relation to the charge\u2014elements Congress has directed to be regarded in fixing bail\u2014I think it violates the law of probabilities. Each accused is entitled to any benefits due to his good record, and misdeeds or a bad record should prejudice only those who are guilty of them. The question when application for bail is made relates to each one's trustworthiness to appear for trial and what security will supply reasonable assurance of his appearance.\n\n\n22\nComplaint further is made that the courts below have been unduly influenced by recommendations of very high bail made by the grand jury. It is not the function of the grand jury to fix bail, and its volunteered advice is not governing. Since the grand jury is a secret body, ordinarily hearing no evidence but the prosecution's, attended by no counsel except the prosecuting attorneys, it is obvious that it is not in a position to make an impartial recommendation. Its suggestion may indicate that those who have heard the evidence for the prosecution regard it as strongly indicative that the accused may be guilty of the crime charged. It could not mean more than that without hearing the defense, and it adds nothing to the inference from the fact of indictment. Such recommendations are better left unmade, and if made should be given no weight.\n\n\n23\nBut the protest charges, and the defect in the proceedings below appears to be, that, provoked by the flight of certain Communists after conviction, the Government demands and public opinion supports a use of the bail power to keep Communist defendants in jail before conviction. Thus, the amount is said to have been fixed not as a reasonable assurance of their presence at the trial, but also as an assurance they would remain in jail. There seems reason to believe that this may have been the spirit to which the courts below have yielded, and it is contrary to the whole policy and philosophy of bail. This is not to say that every defendant is entitled to such bail as he can provide, but he is entitled to an opportunity to make it in a reasonable amount. I think the whole matter should be reconsidered by the appropriate judges in the traditional spirit of bail procedure.\n\n\n24\nThe other questions we have heard argued relate to the remedy appropriate when the standards for amount of bail are misapplied. Of course, procedural rights so vital cannot be without means of vindication. In view of the nature of the writ of habeas corpus, we should be reluctant to say that under no circumstances would it be appropriate. But that writ will best serve its purpose and be best protected from discrediting abuse if it is reserved for cases in which no other procedure will present the issues to the courts. Its use as a substitute for appeals or as an optional alternative to other remedies is not to be encouraged. Habeas corpus is not, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the procedure to test reasonableness of bail.\n\n\n25\nWe think that, properly limited and administered, the motion to reduce bail will afford a practical, simple, adequate and expeditious procedure. In view of prevailing confusions and conflicts in practice, this Court should define and limit the procedure with considerable precision, in the absence of which we may flood the courts with motions and appeals in bail cases.\n\n\n26\nThe first fixing of bail, whether by a commissioner under Rule 5(b), or upon removal under Rule 40(a), Fed.Rules Crim.Proc., or by the court upon arraignment after indictment, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3141, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3141, is a serious exercise of judicial discretion. But often it must be done in haste\u2014the defendant may be taken by surprise, counsel has just been engaged, or for other reasons the bail is fixed without that full inquiry and consideration which the matter deserves. Some procedure for reconsideration is a practical necessity, and the court's power over revocation or reduction is a continuing power which either party may invoke as changing circumstances may require. It is highly important that such preliminary matters as bail be disposed of with as much finality as possible in the District Court where the case is to be tried. It is close to the scene of the offense, most accessible to defendant, has opportunity to see and hear the defendant and the witnesses personally, and is likely to be best informed for sound exercise of discretion. Rarely will the original determination be disturbed, if carefully made, but if the accused moves to reduce or the Government to revoke bail, a more careful deliberation may then be made on the relevant evidence presented by the parties, and if the defendant or the Government is aggrieved by a denial of the motion an appeal may be taken on the record as it then stands.\n\n\n27\nIt is my conclusion that an order denying reduction of bail is to be regarded as a final decision which may be appealed to the Court of Appeals. But this is not because every claim of excessive bail raises a constitutional question. It is because we may properly hold appeal to be a statutory right. While only a sentence constitutes a final judgment in a criminal case, Berman v. United States, 302 U.S. 211, 212, 58 S.Ct. 164, 165, 82 L.Ed. 204, it is a final decision that Congress has made reviewable. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291. While a final judgment always is a final decision, there are instances in which a final decision is not a final judgment. The purpose of the finality requirement is to avoid piecemeal disposition of the basic controversy in a single case 'where the result of review will be 'to halt in the orderly progress of a cause and consider incidentally a question which has happened to cross the path of such litigation * * *\" Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.S. 323, 326, 60 S.Ct. 540, 542, 84 L.Ed. 783. But an order fixing bail can be reviewed without halting the main trial\u2014its issues are entirely independent of the issues to be tried\u2014and unless it can be reviewed before sentence, it never can be reviewed at all. The relation of an order fixing bail to final judgment in a criminal case is analogous to an order determining the right to security in a civil proceeding, Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528, or other interlocutory orders reviewable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292. I would hold, therefore, that such orders are appealable.\n\n\n28\nI cannot agree, however, that an order determining what amount of bail is reasonable under the standards prescribed does not call for an exercise of discretion. The Court of Appeals is not required to reexamine every order complained of. They represent exercises of discretion, upon questions, usually, of fact. Trivial differences or frivolous objections should be dismissed. The Appellate Court should only reverse for clear abuse of discretion or other mistake of law. And it ought to be noted that this Court will not exercise its certiorari power in individual cases except where they are typical of a problem so important and general as to deserve the attention of the supervisory power.\n\n\n29\nIf we would follow this course of reasoning, I think in actual experience it would protect every right of the accused expeditiously and cheaply. At the same time, it would not open the floodgates to a multitude of trivial disputes abusive of the motion procedure.\n\n\n30\nHaving found that the habeas corpus proceeding was properly dismissed by the District Court, in which its judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, we should to that extent affirm. Having thus decided that the procedure taken in this case is not the proper one to bring the question of excessiveness of bail before the courts, there is a measure of inconsistency and departure from usual practice in our discussion of matters not before us. Certainly it would be inappropriate to say now that any particular amount as to any particular defendant is either reasonable or excessive. That concrete amount, in the light of each defendant's testimony and that of the Government, should be fixed by the appropriate judge or Justice upon evidence relevant to the standards prescribed. It is not appropriate for the Court as a whole to fix bail where the power has been given to individual judges and Justices to do so. But there is little in our books to help guide federal judges in bail practice, and the extraordinary and recurring nature of this particular problem seems to warrant a discussion of the merits in which we would not ordinarily engage.\n\n\n31\nIt remains to answer our own question as to whether the power to grant bail is in the Court or in the Circuit Justice. There is considerable confusion as to the source and extent of that power.\n\n\n32\nFed. Rules Crim. Proc. 46(a)(1), with respect to noncapital cases does not state who has power to grant bail before conviction it simply directs that in such case bail 'shall' be granted. For an answer to the 'who' question it is necessary to turn to the Criminal Code.\n\n\n33\n18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3141, entitled 'Power of courts and magistrates', provides: 'Bail may be taken by any court, judge or magistrate authorized to arrest and commit offenders, but in capital cases bail may be taken only by a court of the United States having original or appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases or by a justice or judge thereof.'\n\n\n34\nThe power to arrest and commit offenders is contained in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3041, which states that: 'For any offense against the United States, the offender may, by any justice or judge of the United States, * * * be arrested and imprisoned, or bailed, as the case may be, for trial before such court of the United States as by law has cognizance of the offense.' (Italics added.) The fact that this section specifically grants the power of arrest to 'any justice * * * of the United States' supports the conclusion that Justices of this Court have the power of arrest, and, having that power under this section, they therefore also have power to grant bail under \u00a7 3141.\n\n\n35\nThe Reviser's Notes to \u00a7 3141 disclose that it is the product of Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1015 and 1016, which were embodied verbatim in 18 U.S.C. (1940 ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 596 and 597. The Reviser also states that, 'Sections 596 and 597 of Title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., except as superseded by rule 46(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure are consolidated and rewritten in this section without change of meaning. 80th Congress House Report No. 304.' (Italics added.) Since no change of meaning was intended, the context of the old sections becomes pertinent.\n\n\n36\nRev.Stat. \u00a7 1015 reads: 'Bail shall be admitted upon all arrests in criminal cases where the offense is not punishable by death; and in such cases it may be taken by any of the persons authorized by the preceding section to arrest and imprison offenders.' 'The preceding section,' \u00a7 1014, is the predecessor of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3041, and reads the same as that section, namely: 'For any crime or offense against the United States, the offender may, by any justice or judge of the United States, * * * be arrested and imprisoned, or bailed, as the case may be, for trial before such court of the United States as by law has cognizance of the offense. * * *'. (Italicized words are those omitted in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3041.)\n\n\n37\nGoing on in the Revised Statutes, \u00a7 1016 states that: 'Bail may be admitted upon all arrests in criminal cases where the punishment may be death; but in such cases it shall be taken only by the Supreme Court or a circuit court, or by a justice of the Supreme Court, a circuit judge, or a judge of a district court, who shall exercise their discretion therein, having regard to the nature and circumstance of the offense, and of the evidence, and to the usages of law.'\n\n\n38\nThe evident tenor of \u00a7\u00a7 1015 and 1016, taken together with \u00a7 1014, is that a Justice of this Court is one of many who can grant bail in a noncapital case but is one of a restricted class who can grant bail in a capital case. Section 1016 appears to narrow the class included in \u00a7 1015.\n\n\n39\nTo correlate the Revised Statutes with the present statutory scheme:\n\n\n40\n1. Rule 46(a)(1), reading as follows, is taken from Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1015 and 1016 insofar as the latter govern who shall be admitted to bail and the considerations to be given the admission to bail of a capital case defendant.\n\nRule 46(a)(1), 'Bail before conviction':\n\n41\n'A person arrested for an offense not punishable by death shall be admitted to bail. A person arrested for an offense punishable by death may be admitted to bail by any court or judge authorized by law to do so in the exercise of discretion, giving due weight to the evidence and to the nature and circumstances of the offense.'\n\n\n42\n2. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3041, governing power of arrest, is taken directly from Rev.Stat. \u00a7 1014.\n\n\n43\n3. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3141, setting out who may grant bail, is taken from Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1015 and 1016 insofar as the latter are apropos of that subject.\n\n\n44\nIt thus appears that the scheme of the Revised Statutes has been taken over bodily into the present Code and Rules. The only change I perceive is that, under the Revised Statutes, there was no clear statutory authority for a court to grant bail in a noncapital case. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 1015 (and \u00a7 1014) applicable to such case speak only of individuals. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3141 confers the power on 'any court, judge or magistrate authorized to arrest and commit offenders.'  The only reasonable construction of the latter is the obvious literal one, that is, that courts as well as the individuals empowered to arrest and commit offenders by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3041, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3041 are authorized to grant bail. This is substantiated by the language of Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. 46(c), 'Amount (of bail)': 'If the defendant is admitted to bail, the amount thereof shall be such as in the judgment of the commissioner or court or judge or justice will insure the presence of the defendant * * *.' (Italics added.)\n\n\n45\nThat is the one difference between the Revised Statutes' scheme and the present\u2014the power to grant bail in noncapital cases now clearly is vested in the courts as well as in individual judges and justices.\n\n\n46\nWith the premise provided by the Revisor that the power to grant bail before conviction is the same now as under the Revised Statutes, the one exception being the extension to the courts just noted, the conclusion follows that bail can be granted by any court of the United States, including this Court, or by any judge of the United States, including the Justices of this Court.\n\n\n47\nThe next problem is how Rule 45 of the Rules of this Court, 28 U.S.C.A., is to be assimilated with the foregoing. Only the first and fourth subsections of the Rule have any present pertinence. They read as follows:\n\n\n48\n'1. Pending review of a decision refusing a writ of habeas corpus, the custody of the prisoner shall not be disturbed.\n\n\n49\n'4. The initial order respecting the custody or enlargement of the prisoner pending review, as also any recognizance taken, shall be deemed to cover not only the review in the intermediate appellate court but also the further possible review in this court; and only where special reasons therefor are shown to this court will it disturb that order, or make any independent order in that regard.' The apparent conflict between the two subsections disappears when subsection 4 is viewed as a reservation of power in this Court only, not in an individual Justice of this Court, to issue an order in exceptional cases disturbing the custody of the prisoner. No other court and no individual judge or justice can disturb the custody of the prisoner. See Carlson v. Landon, 341 U.S. 918, 71 S.Ct. 744, 95 L.Ed. 1353.\n\n\n50\nThe next problem is the bearing, if any, of Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. 46(a)(2), covering the right to bail 'Upon Review.' It reads: 'Bail may be allowed pending appeal or certiorari only if it appears that the case involves a stubstantial question which should be determined by the appellate court. Bail may be allowed by the trial judge or by the appellate court or by any judge thereof or by the circuit justice. * * *' Insofar as it might be applicable to petitioners' case, since they were seeking a review when they filed their petition for bail, it would not seem that it has any efficacy. They have not yet been tried for the offense for which they have been indicted, so that the much wider powers of bail conferred by the statutes governing bail before conviction are applicable. Rule 46(a)(2) is only intended to apply where a review of a conviction on the merits is sought.\n\n\n51\nTurning back to the case at hand, and treating the application to Mr. Justice DOUGLAS for bail as one for bail pending review of a denial of habeas corpus, I think it clear that he does not have power to grant bail, but the full Court does have that power. However, since the Court sustains the denial of habeas corpus, treating the application for bail strictly as one pending review of the denial of habeas corpus, the problems it raises are actually moot. If the application to Mr. Justice DOUGLAS be treated as one made for fixing bail in the original case, it is my opinion that he has power to entertain it.\n\n\n\n1\n 'Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.' U.S.Const. Amend. VIII.\n\n\n2\n In view of our action in granting and making final disposition of the petition for certiorari, we have no occasion to determine the power of a single Justice or Circuit Justice to fix bail pending disposition of a petition for certiorari in a case of this kind.\n\n\n3\n Rule 46(c). 'AMOUNT. If the defendant is admitted to bail, the amount thereof shall be such as in the judgment of the commissioner or court or judge or justice will insure the presence of the defendant, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offense charged, the weight of the evidence against him, the financial ability of the defendant to give bail and the character of the defendant.'\n\n\n","label":0}

Dineen, New Haven, Conn., for appellants.\nF. Michael Ahern, Hartford, Conn., for the State of Connecticut, as amicus curiae, in support of judgment.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nWe noted probable jurisdiction in this case to decide whether \u00a7 52\u2014542 of the Connecticut General Statutes1 requiring a bond for the protection of his landlord from a tenant who wished to appeal from a judgment in a summary eviction proceeding, offends either the Due Process or Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if applied to foreclose appellate review for those too poor to post the bond, 394 U.S. 957, 89 S.Ct. 1311, 22 L.Ed.2d 558 (1969).\n\n\n2\nBecause of an ambiguity in the record concerning the underlying reason these appellants were denied an opportunity to appeal the trial court's judgment ordering that they be evicted, we now conclude that this appeal should be dismissed, DeBacker v. Brainard, 396 U.S. 28, 90 S.Ct. 163, 24 L.Ed.2d 148 (1969); Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, 331 U.S. 549, 67 S.Ct. 1409, 91 L.Ed. 1666 (1947).\n\n\n3\nAfter unsuccessfully litigating in the trial court a summary eviction proceeding begun by their landlords, appellants moved in the trial court for a waiver of the bond requirement so that they might appeal. The trial court, apparently of the view that it had the power to waive the statutory bond requirement in an appropriate case, denied appellants' motion on a finding that 'this appeal is being taken for the purpose of delay.' App. 23. Appellants sought review of the trial court's denial of their motion in the Connecticut Circuit Court, and that court denied review and dismissed appellants' appeal. It is unclear from that court's opinion, however, whether it thought the bond requirement of \u00a7 52\u2014542 left no room for a waiver,2 or instead based its refusal to hear appellants' appeal in part on the trial court's finding\u2014cited in the Circuit Court's opinion3 that the appeal before it was taken only for purpose of delay. 5 Conn.Cir. 282, 250 A.2d 527 (1968). Appellants' petition to the Supreme Court of Connecticut to certify the case for review was declined.\n\n\n4\nIn these circumstances, we deem it inappropriate for this Court to decide the constitutional issue tendered by appellants.\n\n\n5\nDismissed.\n\n\n6\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n7\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\n\n8\nThis was a summary procedure brought by a landlord1 to obtain possession from his tenants for nonpayment of rent. The trial court found for the landlord and the tenants appealed.\n\n\n9\nConnecticut law requires one taking an appeal in such an action to post a bond with surety. The tenants showed they were financially unable to post the bond and claimed that to require a bond with surety to obtain an appeal would under those circumstances be a denial of equal protection. The trial court refused to waive the requirement for a bond with surety saying that 'the appeal is being taken for the purpose of delay.'\n\n\n10\nThe Circuit Court affirmed. The Appellate Division ordered the termination of a stay of execution. 5 Conn.Cir. 282, 250 A.2d 527. The Supreme Court denied certification.\n\n\n11\nI would reverse this judgment. A rich tenant, whatever his motives for appeal, would obtain appellate review. These tenants, because of their poverty, obtain none. I can imagine no clear violation of the requirement of equal protection unless it be Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891. Whether the case is criminal or civil, wealth, like race, is a suspect criterion for classification of those who have rights and those who do not. Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 86 S.Ct. 1079, 16 L.Ed.2d 169; Lee v. Habib, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 403, 424 F.2d 891.2\n\n\n12\nWhat the merits of the tenants' appeal may be is not for us to say. But the appeal raised questions not easily answered. The terms of the lease stated that it could be terminated by not less than 30 days' notice, while apparently no more than five days' notice was given. A housing authority that is federally assisted has the right by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404a (1964 ed., Supp. V), 'to maintain an action or proceeding to recover possession of any housing accommodations operated by it where such action is authorized by the statute or regulations under which such housing accommodations are administered.' There is not a word in appellee's argument that indicates that the federal regulations permit eviction on five days' notice where the lease requires 30 days' notice.\n\n\n13\nThe case has been argued as if appellants are 'cheap skates' seeking to get something for nothing. That simply is not true, for the record shows:\n\n\n14\n'Mrs. Faulkner: Your Honor, may I urge upon you that if you      grant our motion to have the defendants deposit the rent in      court the landlord will not be hurt any further by delay in      this proceedings. He will be protected because the monthly      rent will be deposited. If he is successful on appeal he will      be able to get the rent.\n\n\n15\n'The Court: Do you suggest, if that should be the conclusion,      that the clerk could issue an execution upon failure to pay?\n\n\n16\n'Mrs. Faulkner: Yes.\n\n\n17\n'The Court: In other words, you will be willing to stipulate      on behalf of your clients that if the rent were not paid that      the clerk would, may be empowered forthwith to issue an      execution?\n\n\n18\n'Mrs. Faulkner: Yes, Your Honor.\n\n\n19\n'The Court: That appeal to you all right?\n\n\n20\n'Mr. Philbin: Frankly it doesn't. During this period of time,      it could take a considerable period of time, even if the tenant pays the fund into the clerk's      office, they are not available to the plaintiff and we are      still as a practical matter losing the rents during that      period of time. Eventually if we prevail and get this money      this would be an extended period of time.' App. 19\u201420.\n\n\n21\nThe State of Connecticut represents that tis summary eviction statute is based on an English Act of 1737, 11 Geo. 2, c. 19; and with all respect, the decisions below reflect an 18th century lawyer's approach to the task of protecting a landed interest. Every appeal of course entails delay; and in a sense all appeals are antithetical to the spirit of summary eviction. But we live today under a different regime. Unlike 1737, appellate courts are no longer closed to the poor. Eviction laws emphasize speed for the benefit of landlords. Equal protection often necessitates an opportunity for the poor as well as the affluent to be heard. I disagree with the Court that the issue is not squarely presented in this case.3 I would reverse this judgment.\n\n\n\n1\n At the time of the decisions below in this case, \u00a7 52\u2014542 provided:\n'Bond on appeal; stay of execution. When any appeal is taken by the defendant in an action of summary process, he shall give a sufficient bond with surety to the adverse party, to answer for all rents that may accrue or, where no lease had existed, for the reasonable value for such use and occupancy, during the pendency of such appeal, or which may be due at the time of its final disposal; and execution shall be stayed for five days from the date judgment has been rendered, but any Sunday or legal holiday intervening shall be excluded in computing such five days. No appeal shall be taken except within said period, and if an appeal is taken within said period, execution shall be stayed until the final determination of the cause, unless it appears to the judge who tried the case that the appeal was taken for the purpose of delay; and if execution has not been stayed, as hereinbefore provided, execution may then issue, except as otherwise provided in sections 52\u2014543 to 52\u2014548, inclusive.'\nThis version of \u00a7 52\u2014542 has been repealed and a revision substituted effective as of October 1, 1969, see Conn.Pub.Acts No. 296 (1969).\n\n\n2\n The opinion states in one place that '(a) sufficient bond with surety is essential to a valid appeal.' 5 Conn.Cir. 282, 285, 250 A.2d 527, 529 (1968). The court also said that '(w)ant of bond with surety, where bond with surety is by statute a prerequisite of review, furnishes a sufficient ground of dismissal of the appeal.' Id., at 288, 250 A.2d, at 531. At oral argument here, however, the State of Connecticut, appearing as amicus curiae, contended that the statutory bond requirement could, in an appropriate case, be waived. The opinion of the Circuit Court did not expressly pass on this issue, which it appears was not settled under Connecticut law at the time of its decision. A subsequent decision of a Connecticut circuit court suggests that the bond requirement is an absolute and necessary condition for an appeal, but it too did not consider the waiver contention made by the State before this Court, see Housing Authority v. Jones, 5 Conn.Cir. 350, 252 A.2d 465 (1968). Moreover, this decision did not consider the effect of the 1969 amendment to \u00a7 52\u2014542, see n. 1, supra.\n\n\n3\n The opinion states in another place:\n'On January 19, 1968, the trial court held a special hearing on the defendants' application for waiver of security on appeal. The court found that no rent had been paid since May 1, 1967, nor had the defendants offered to pay any part of the rent due; that the record contained 'dilatory tactics, and (was) loaded with defenses interposed to delay and obstruct the summary process action'; and that the 'appeal is being taken for the purpose of delay.' Accordingly, the court denied the application for waiver of security on appeal.' 5 Conn.Cir., at 284, 250 A.2d, at 529.\nThe same Circuit Court, in later granting the landlord's motion for an order terminating a stay of execution of the eviction order, expressly affirmed the trial court's findings saying:\n'We have before us the entire file in the case. The record and briefs comprise some 140 typewritten pages. Upon a review of the whole matter, we are satisfied that (the trial judge) was justified in concluding, as he did when he denied the defendants' application for a waiver of security on appeal, 'that this appeal is being taken for the purpose of delay.\" 5 Conn.Cir., at 290, 250 A.2d, at 532.\n\n\n1\n Appellee operates a federally assisted low-rent housing project under the authority of Title V of the Housing Act of 1959, 73 Stat. 679, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401 et seq., (1964 ed. and Supp. V) and Conn.Gen.Stat.Rev. \u00a7 8\u201438 et seq.\n\n\n2\n In that case Judge J. Skelly Wright, speaking for the Court of Appeals said:\n'The limits of a state's duty affirmatively to equalize a defendant's ability to participate meaningfully in the judicial process are only now being sketched out in the cases. The picture is far from complete, but recent cases dealing with costs in divorce cases and transcripts on appeal from proceedings involving determination of parental rights, coupled with the expansive readings being given to in forma pauperis statutes, all suggest that the trend seems to be toward more, not less, affirmative action. Thus, while most of the cases extending equal protection to the judicial process have involved criminal proceedings, the constitutional mandate that there be no invidious discrimination between indigent and rich litigants is being recognized in civil cases as well.\n'The equal protection clause applies to both civil and criminal cases; the Constitution protects life, liberty and property. It is the importance of the right to the individual, not the technical distinction between civil and criminal, which should be of importance to a court in deciding what procedures are constitutionally required in each case. Often a poor litigant will have more at stake in a civil case than in a criminal case.' 137 U.S.App.D.C. at 412\u2014413, 424 F.2d, at 900.\n\n\n3\n On review, the Connecticut court stated that a 'sufficient bond with surety is essential to a valid appeal.' But in the setting of the opinion, as I read it, that meant no more than a description of the normal manner of effecting an appeal. And the Connecticut court's insistence that the tenants did not lack 'the economic power to make themselves heard in a court of law' refers to the fact that they were ably represented by attorneys for the New Haven Legal Assistance Association, Inc., a factor only emphasizing their indigency. Not a word in the opinions of the Connecticut courts suggests that the statutory bond requirement could not be waived.\n\n\n","label":1}

Frankel, Washington, D.C., for appellant.\nMr. Richard Maguire, Boston, Mass., for appellees.\nMr. Justice MINTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nOn March 16, 1951, a one-count indictment was returned in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the appellees, Beacon Brass Company, a corporation, and Maurice Feinberg, its president and treasurer. The indictment charged that in violation of \u00a7 145(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, 40 Stat. 1085, as amended, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 145(b), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 145(b), the appellees had willfully attempted to evade taxes by making false statements to Treasury representatives on October 24, 1945, 'for the purpose of supporting, ratifying, confirming and concealing the fraudulent and incorrect statements and representations made in the corporate tax return of said Beacon Brass Co., Inc., for the fiscal period ending October 31, 1944, filed on or about January 5, 1945 * * *.' Section 145(b) provides in pertinent part:\n\n\n2\n'(A)ny person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade      or defeat any tax imposed by this chapter or the payment      thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by      law, be guilty of a felony * * *.' (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n3\nThe six-year limitation period, 43 Stat. 341, 342, as amended, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3748(a)(2), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3748(a)(2), applicable to offenses under this statute, had expired on a charge for filing a false tax return in January 1945, but it had not expired on a charge of making false statements to Treasury employees in October 1945. The District Court viewed the indictment as charging the separate crimes of filing a false return and making subsequent false statements to Treasury representatives, and dismissed the indictment as duplicitous.\n\n\n4\nOn September 14, 1951, a second indictment was returned against the appellees which repeated the charge that in violation of \u00a7 145(b) they 'did wilfully and knowingly attempt to defeat and evade a large part of the taxes due and owing by the said corporation * * * by making certain false and fraudulent statements and representations, at a hearing and conference before representatives and employees of the United States Treasury Department, on or about October 24, 1945 * * *.' Reference to the allegedly false return filed in January 1945 was omitted, and instead it was charged that the false statements were made 'for the purpose of concealing additional unreported net income * * *.'\n\n\n5\nSection 35(A) of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 80 (1946 ed.) (now 18 U.S.C. (Supp. V) \u00a7 1001, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001) makes it unlawful to 'knowingly and willfully * * * make * * * any false or fraudulent statements or representations * * * in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States * * *.' Obviously, at the times of the indictments here, the three-year limitation period, 18 U.S.C. (Supp. V) \u00a7 3282, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3282, for violations of this statute had expired as to statements made in October 1945. The District Court concluded that since \u00a7 35(A) deals specifically with false statements, Congress must be presumed to have intended that the making of false statements should be punishable only under \u00a7 35(A). Therefore, the District Court dismissed the indictment on the ground that it failed to charge an offense under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 145(b), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 145(b). 106 F.Supp. 510. We noted probable jurisdiction of the United States' appeal taken under authority of 18 U.S.C. (Supp. V) \u00a7 3731, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3731.\n\n\n6\nWe have before us two statutes, each of which proscribes conduct not covered by the other, but which overlap in a narrow area illustrated by the instant case. At least where different proof is required for each offense, a single act or transaction may violate more than one criminal statute. United States v. Noveck, 273 U.S. 202, 206, 47 S.Ct. 341, 342, 71 L.Ed. 610; Gavieres v. United States, 220 U.S. 338, 31 S.Ct. 421, 55 L.Ed. 489. Unlike \u00a7 35(A), \u00a7 145(b) requires proof that the false statements were made in a willful effort to evade taxes. The purpose to evade taxes is crucial under this section. The language of \u00a7 145(b) which outlaws willful attempts to evade taxes 'in any manner' is clearly broad enough to include false statements made to Treasury representatives for the purpose of concealing unreported income. Cf. Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492, 499, 63 S.Ct. 364, 368, 87 L.Ed. 418. The question raised by the decision below is whether by enacting a statute specifically outlawing all false statements in matters under the jurisdiction of agencies of the United States, Congress intended thereby to exclude the making of false statements from the scope of \u00a7 145(b).\n\n\n7\nWe do not believe that Congress intended to require the tax-enforcement authorities to deal differently with false statements than with other methods of tax evasion. By providing that the sanctions of \u00a7 145(b) should be 'in addition to other penalties provided by law,' Congress recognized that some methods of attempting to evade taxes would violate other statutes as well. See Taylor v. United States, 9 Cir., 179 F.2d 640, 644. Moreover, since no distinction is made in \u00a7 35(A) between written and oral statements, the reasoning of the court below would be equally applicable to false tax returns which are, of course, false written statements. But the Courts of Appeals have uniformly applied \u00a7 145(b) to attempts to evade taxes by filing false returns. E.g., Gaunt v. United States, 1 Cir., 184 F.2d 284, 288; Taylor v. United States, supra, 179 F.2d at pages 643\u2014644. Further support for our conclusion can be found in United States v. Noveck, supra, where this Court rejected the contention that the enactment of \u00a7 145(b) impliedly repealed the general perjury statute insofar as that statute applied to false tax returns made under oath. Cf. United States v. Gilliland, 312 U.S. 86, 93, 95 96, 61 S.Ct. 518, 522, 523, 85 L.Ed. 598. Finally, the enactment of other statutes expressly outlawing false statements in particular contexts, e.g., 18 U.S.C.(Supp. V) \u00a7\u00a7 1010, 1014, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1010, 1014, negates the assumption\u2014which was the foundation of the decision of the court below\u2014that Congress intended the making of false statements to be punishable only under \u00a7 35(A).\n\n\n8\nThe appellees contend that the acts charged constitute only one crime of tax evasion which was complete when the allegedly false tax return was filed. On the basis of this contention, appellees seek to sustain the decision below on the grounds that the six-year statute of limitations had run, and that the dismissal of the first indictment is res judicata and a bar to the second indictment for the same offense. We do not consider these questions because our jurisdiction on this appeal is limited to review of the District Court's construction of the statute in the light of the facts alleged in the indictment. 18 U.S.C.(Supp. V) \u00a7 3731, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3731; United States v. Borden Co., 308 U.S. 188, 206\u2014207, 60 S.Ct. 182, 191\u2014192, 84 L.Ed. 181.\n\n\n9\nThe judgment of the District Court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n10\nReversed.\n\n\n11\nMr. Justice BLACK is of the opinion that the District Court reached the right result and would affirm its judgment.\n\n","label":0}

Puerto Rico receives less assistance than do the States, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1308(a)(1), 1396d(b) (1976 ed. and Supp. II).  Appellees, AFDC recipients residing in Puerto Rico, filed this class action against the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (now the Secretary of Health and Human Services) in March 1977 in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico;  they challenged the constitutionality of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1308 and 1396d(b), claiming successfully that the lower level of AFDC reimbursement provided to Puerto Rico violates the Fifth Amendment's equal protection guarantee.\n\n\n2\nWe disagree.  Congress, which is empowered under the Territory Clause of the Constitution, U.S.Const., Art. IV, \u00a7 3, cl. 2, to \"make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory  . . .  belonging to the United States,\" may treat Puerto Rico differently from States so long as there is a rational basis for its actions.  In Califano v. Torres, 435 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 906, 55 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978) (per curiam ), we concluded that a similar statutory classification was rationally grounded on three factors:  Puerto Rican residents do not contribute to the federal treasury;  the cost of treating Puerto Rico as a State under the statute would be high;  and greater benefits could disrupt the Puerto Rican economy.  These same considerations are forwarded here in support of \u00a7\u00a7 1308 and 1396d(b), Juris. Statement 12-14,* and we see no reason to depart from our conclusion in Torres that they suffice to form a rational basis for the challenged statutory classification.\n\n\n3\nWe reverse.\n\n\n4\nSo ordered.\n\n\n5\nMr. Justice BRENNAN and Mr. Justice BLACKMUN, not now being persuaded that the Court's summary disposition in Califano v. Torres, 435 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 906, 55 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978), so clearly controls this case, would note probable jurisdiction and set the case for oral argument.\n\n\n6\nMr. Justice MARSHALL, dissenting.\n\n\n7\nThe Court today rushes to resolve important legal issues without full briefing or oral argument.  The sole authority cited for the majority's result is another summary decision by this Court.  The need for such haste is unclear.  The dangers of such decisionmaking are clear, however, as the Court's analysis is, in my view, ill-conceived in at least two respects.\n\n\n8\nThe first question that merits plenary attention is whether Congress, acting pursuant to the Territory Clause of the Constitution, U.S.Const., Art. IV, \u00a7 3, cl. 2, \"may treat Puerto Rico differently from States so long as there is a rational basis for its actions.\"  Ante, at 651-652. No authority is cited for this proposition.  Our prior decisions do not support such a broad statement.\n\n\n9\nIt is important to remember at the outset that Puerto Ricans are United States citizens, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1402, and that different treatment to Puerto Rico under AFDC may well affect the benefits paid to these citizens.1  While some early opinions of this Court suggested that various protections of the Constitution do not apply to Puerto Rico, see, e. g. Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244, 21 S.Ct. 770, 45 L.Ed. 1088 (1901);  Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U.S. 298, 42 S.Ct. 343, 66 L.Ed. 627 (1922), the present validity of those decisions is questionable.  See Torres v. Puerto Rico, 442 U.S. 465, 475-476, 99 S.Ct. 2425, 2431-2432, 61 L.Ed.2d 1 (1979) (BRENNAN, J., concurring in judgment).  We have already held that Puerto Rico is subject to the Due Process Clause of either the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment, Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U.S. 663, 668-669, n. 5, 94 S.Ct. 2080, 2084, n. 5, 40 L.Ed.2d 452 (1974), and the equal protection guarantee of either the Fifth or the Fourteenth Amendment, Examining Board v. Flores de Otero, 426 U.S. 572, 599-601, 96 S.Ct. 2264, 2279-2280, 49 L.Ed.2d 65 (1976).  The Fourth Amendment is also fully applicable to Puerto Rico, either directly or by operation of the Fourteenth Amendment, Torres v. Puerto Rico, supra, at 471, 99 S.Ct. at 2429.  At least four Members of this Court are of the view that all provisions of the Bill of Rights apply to Puerto Rico.  442 U.S., at 475-476, 99 S.Ct., at 2431-2432 (BRENNAN, J., joined by STEWART, MARSHALL, and BLACKMUN, JJ., concurring in judgment).\n\n\n10\nDespite these precedents, the Court suggests today, without benefit of briefing or argument, that Congress needs only a rational basis to support less beneficial treatment for Puerto Rico, and the citizens residing there, than is provided to the States and citizens residing in the States.  Heightened scrutiny under the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment, the Court concludes, is simply unavailable to protect Puerto Rico or the citizens who reside there from discriminatory legislation, as long as Congress acts pursuant to the Territory Clause.  Such a proposition surely warrants the full attention of this Court before it is made part of our constitutional jurisprudence.\n\n\n11\nCalifano v. Torres, 435 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 906, 55 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978) (per curiam ), the only authority upon which the majority relies, does not stand for the proposition the Court espouses today.  In that decision, also reached through summary procedures and over the objections of two Members of the Court, see id., at 5, 98 S.Ct., at 908 (statement of BRENNAN, J.;  statement of MARSHALL, J.), the Court held that the right to travel was not violated by a provision of the Social Security Act pursuant to which persons residing in the United States lost their supplemental security income benefits upon moving to Puerto Rico. While the plaintiffs in that case had also challenged the provision on equal protection grounds, the District Court relied entirely on the right to travel,2 and therefore no equal protection question was before this Court.3  The Court merely referred to the equal protection claim briefly in a footnote, id., at 3, n. 4, 98 S.Ct., at 907, n. 4.  Observing that Puerto Rico's relationship with the United States was unique, the Court simply noted that the District Court had \"apparently acknowledged that Congress has the power to treat Puerto Rico differently, and that every federal program does not have to be extended to it.\"  Ibid.4  That Puerto Rico has an unparalleled relationship with the United States does not lead ineluctably to the legal principle asserted here.  At most, reading, more into that single footnote of dictum than it deserves, Califano v. Torres may suggest that under the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, Puerto Rico may be treated differently from the States if there is a rational basis for the discrimination when Congress enacts a law providing for governmental payments of monetary benefits.  See id., at 5, 98 S.Ct. at 908.  That is a more limited view than is asserted in this case, but even that position should be reached only after oral argument and full briefing.  Ibid. (statement of MARSHALL, J.).\n\n\n12\nI also object to the Court's reliance on the effect greater benefits could have on the Puerto Rican economy.  Ante, at 652. See also Califano v. Torres, supra, at 5, n. 7, 98 S.Ct. at 908, n. 7.  This rationale has troubling overtones.  It suggests that programs designed to help the poor should be less fully applied in those areas where the need may be the greatest, simply because otherwise the relative poverty of recipients compared to other persons in the same geographic area will somehow be upset. Similarly, reliance on the fear of disrupting the Puerto Rican economy implies that Congress intended to preserve or even strengthen the comparative economic position of the States vis-a-vis Puerto Rico.  Under this theory, those geographic units of the country which have the strongest economies presumably would get the most financial aid from the Federal Government since those units would be the least likely to be \"disrupted.\"  Such an approach to a financial assistance program is not so clearly rational as the Court suggests, and there is no citation by the Court to any suggestion in the legislative history that Congress had these economic concerns in mind when it passed the portion of the AFDC program presently being challenged.  Nor does appellant refer to any evidence in the record supporting the notion that such a speculative fear of economic disruption is warranted.5  In my view it is by no means clear that the discrimination at issue here could survive scrutiny under even a deferential equal protection standard.\n\n\n13\nUltimately this case raises the serious issue of the relationship of Puerto Rico, and the United States citizens who reside there, to the Constitution.  An issue of this magnitude deserves far more careful attention than it has received in Califano v. Torres and in the present case.  I would note probable jurisdiction and set the case for oral argument. Accordingly, I dissent from the Court's summary disposition.\n\n\n\n*\n For example, the Secretary estimates that the additional cost of treating Puerto Rico as a State for AFDC purposes alone would be approximately $30 million per year, and, if the decision below were to apply equally to various other reimbursement programs under the Social Security Act, the total annual cost could exceed $240 million.  Juris. Statement 12, n. 13.\n\n\n1\n The District Court certified the plaintiff class as \"all United States citizens residing in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which [sic ] are recipients of public assistance under the Aid to the Families with Dependent Children category and that have been, are and will be discriminated [against] solely on the basis of their residence.\"  App. to Juris. Statement 2a.\nIt is unclear whether the Court's Territory Clause analysis is intended to apply only where the discrimination is against the Government of Puerto Rico and not against persons residing there. Such a distinction would lack substance in any event.  The discrimination against Puerto Rico under the AFDC program must also operate as a discrimination against United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico who would benefit one way or another, from such increased federal aid to Puerto Rico.\n\n\n2\n The District Court concluded that \"[w]e are not here concerned with the alleged power of Congress to establish disparate treatment towards the United States citizens who reside in Puerto Rico.  Rather, the focus of our attention should be directed to determining whether a constitutional right of a citizen of the United States has been improperly penalized while he is within one of these States.  We see this as the more relevant framing of the issues because although Plaintiff lost his benefits while physically in Puerto Rico, the statutory prohibitions that permitted this result came into play from the very moment when they exerted their force upon Plaintiff.  From this standpoint, Plaintiff is in the same position now as if he would have remained in Connecticut and brought a declaratory judgment suit there.  . . .\"  Torres v. Mathews, 426 F.Supp. 1106, 1110 (1977) (emphasis deleted).\n\n\n3\n The question presented in Califano v. Torres was whether the sections of the Social Security Act excluding residents of Puerto Rico from the Supplemental Security Income program \"deny due process to individuals who upon moving to Puerto Rico lose the benefits to which they were entitled while residing in the United States.\"  Juris. Statement, O.T.1977, No. 77-88, p. 2.  See also id., at 9-11.\n\n\n4\n The accuracy of this assessment of the District Court's opinion is open to question.  See n. 2, supra.\n\n\n5\n Appellant's suggestion that increased federal reimbursements might not go to the class members at all but instead be used to provide other services or to lower taxes, see Juris. Statement 10, demonstrates the speculative nature of this fear of economic disruption.\n\n\n","label":1}

WATSON, Jr., et al., Petitioners,v.CITY OF MEMPHIS, TENN., et al.\nNo. 424.\nArgued April 17 and 18, 1963.\nDecided May 27, 1963.\n\n[Syllabus from pages 526-527 intentionally omitted]\nConstance B. Motley, New York City, for petitioners.\nThomas R. Prewitt, Memphis, Tenn., for respondents.\nMr. Justice GOLDBERG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe issue in this case, simply stated, is whether the City of Memphis may further delay in meeting fully its constitutional obligation under the Fourteenth Amendment to desegregate its public parks and other municipal recreational facilities.\n\n\n2\nThe petitioners, adult Negro residents of Memphis, commenced this action against the city in May 1960 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief directing immediate desegregation of municipal parks and other city owned or operated recreational facilities from which Negroes were then still excluded. The city denied neither the fact that the majority of the relevant facilities were operated on a segregated basis nor its duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to terminate its policy of conditioning use of such facilities on race. Instead, it pointed to the partial desegregation already effected and attempted to justify its further delay in conforming fully and at once to constitutional mandates by urging the need and wisdom of proceeding slowly and gradually in its desegregation efforts.\n\n\n3\nThe District Court denied the relief sought by the petitioners and ordered the city to submit, within six months, a plan providing additional time for desegregation of the relevant facilities.1 The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 303 F.2d 863. We granted certiorari, 371 U.S. 909, 83 S.Ct. 256, 9 L.Ed.2d 169, to consider the important question presented and the applicability here of the principles enunciated by this Court in the second Brown decision, Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083, upon which the courts below relied in further delaying complete vindication of the petitioners' constitutional rights.\n\n\n4\nWe find the second Brown decision to be inapplicable here and accordingly reverse the judgment below.\n\nI.\n\n5\nIt is important at the outset to note the chronological context in which the city makes its claim to entitlement to additional time within which to work out complete elimination of racial barriers to use of the public facilities here involved. It is now more than nine years since this Court held in the first Brown decision, Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873, that racial segregation in state public schools violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. And it was almost eight years ago\u2014in 1955, the year after the decision on the merits in Brown\u2014that the constitutional proscription of state enforced racial segregation was found to apply to public recreational facilities. See Dawson v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 4 Cir., 220 F.2d 386, aff'd, 350 U.S. 877, 76 S.Ct. 133, 100 L.Ed. 774; see also Muir v. Louisville Park Theatrical Assn., 347 U.S. 971, 74 S.Ct. 783, 98 L.Ed. 1112.\n\n\n6\nThus, the applicability here of the factors and reasoning relied on in framing the 1955 decree in the second Brown decision, supra, which contemplated the possible need of some limited delay in effecting total desegregation of public schools, must be considered not only in the context of factual similarities, if any, between that case and this one, but also in light of the significant fact that the governing constitutional principles no longer bear the imprint of newly enunciated doctrine. In considering the appropriateness of the equitable decree entered below inviting a plan calling for an even longer delay in effecting desegregation, we cannot ignore the passage of a substantial period of time since the original declaration of the manifest unconstitutionality of racial practices such as are here challenged, the repeated and numerous decisions giving notice of such illegality,2 and the many intervening opportunities heretofore available to attain the equality of treatment which the Fourteenth Amendment commands the States to achieve. These factors must inevitably and substantially temper the present import of such broad policy considerations as may have underlain, even in part, the form of decree ultimately framed in the Brown case. Given the extended time which has elapsed, it is far from clear that the mandate of the second Brown decision requiring that desegregation proceed with 'all deliberate speed' would today be fully satisfied by types of plans or programs for desegregation of public educational facilities which eight years ago might have been deemed sufficient. Brown never contemplated that the concept of 'deliberate speed' would countenance indefinite delay in elimination of racial barriers in schools, let alone other public facilities not involving the same physical problems or comparable conditions.\n\nII.\n\n7\nWhen, in 1954, in the first Brown decision, this Court declared the constitutional impermissibility of racial segregation in public schools, it did not immediately frame a decree, but instead invited and heard further argument on the question of relief. In its subsequent opinion, the Court noted that '(f)ull implementation of these (applicable) constitutional principles may require solution of varied local school problems' and indicated an appropriate scope for the application of equitable principles consistent with both public and private need and for 'exercise of (the) * * * traditional attributes of equity power.' 349 U.S., at 299\u2014300, 75 S.Ct., at 756, 99 L.Ed. 1083. The District Courts to which the cases there under consideration were remanded were invested with a discretion appropriate to ultimate fashioning of detailed relief consonant with properly cognizable local conditions. This did not mean, however, that the discretion was even then unfettered or exercisable without restraint. Basic to the remand was the concept that desegregation must proceed with 'all deliberate speed,' and the problems which might be considered and which might justify a decree requiring something less than immediate and total desegregation were severely delimited. Hostility to the constitutional precepts underlying the original decision was expressly and firmly pretermitted as such an operative factor. Id., 349 U.S., at 300, 75 S.Ct., at 756, 99 L.Ed. 1083.\n\n\n8\nThe nature of the ultimate resolution effected in the second Brown decision largely reflected no more than a recognition of the unusual and particular problems inhering in desegregating large numbers of schools throughout the country. The careful specification of factors relevant to a determination whether any delay in complying fully and completely with the constitutional mandate would be warranted demonstrated a concern that delay not be conditioned upon insufficient reasons or, in any event, tolerated unless it imperatively and compellingly appeared unavoidable.\n\n\n9\nThis case presents no obvious occasion for the application of Brown. We are not here confronted with attempted desegregation of a local school system with any or all of the perhaps uniquely attendant problems, administrative and other, specified in the second Brown decision as proper considerations in weighing the need for further delay in vindicating the Fourteenth Amendment rights of petitioners.3 Desegregation of parks and other recreational facilities does not present the same kinds of cognizable difficulties inhering in elimination of racial classification in schools, at which attendance is compulsory, the adequacy of teachers and facilities crucial, and questions of geographic assignment often of major significance.4\n\n\n10\nMost importantly, of course, it must be recognized that even the delay countenanced by Brown was a necessary, albeit significant, adaptation of the usual principle that any deprivation of constitutional rights calls for prompt rectification. The rights here asserted are, like all such rights, present rights; they are not merely hopes to some future enjoyment of some formalistic constitutional promise. The basic guarantees of our Constitution are warrants for the here and now and, unless there is an overwhelmingly compelling reason, they are to be promptly fulfilled.5 The second Brown decision is but a narrowly drawn, and carefully limited, qualification upon usual precepts of constitutional adjudication and is not to be unnecessarily expanded in application.\n\n\n11\nSolely because of their race, the petitioners here have been refused the use of city owned or operated parks and other recreational facilities which the Constitution mandates be open to their enjoyment on equal terms with white persons. The city has effected, continues to effect, and claims the right or need to prolong patently unconstitutional racial discriminations violative of now long-declared and well-established individual rights. The claims of the city to further delay in affording the petitioners that to which they are clearly and unquestionably entitled cannot be upheld except upon the most convincing and impressive demonstration by the city that such delay is manifestly compelled by constitutionally cognizable circumstances warranting the exercise of an appropriate equitable discretion by a court. In short, the city must sustain an extremely heavy burden of proof.\n\n\n12\nExamination of the facts of this case in light of the foregoing discussion discloses with singular clarity that this burden has not been sustained; indeed, it is patent from the record that the principles enunciated in the second Brown decision have absolutely no application here.\n\nIII.\n\n13\nThe findings of the District Court disclose an unmistakable and pervasive pattern of local segregation, which, in fact, the city makes no attempt to deny, but merely attempts to justify as necessary for the time being. Memphis owns 131 parks, all of which are operated by the Memphis Park Commisson. Of these, only 25 were at the time of trial open to use without regard to race;6 58 were restricted to use by whites and 25 to use by Negroes; the remaining 23 parks were undeveloped raw land. Subject to exceptions, neighborhood parks were generally segregated according to the racial character of the area in which located. The City Park Commission also operates a number of additional recreational facilities, by far the largest share of which were found to be racially segregated. Though a zoo, an art gallery and certain boating and other facilities are now desegregated, about two-thirds (40) of the 61 city-owned playgrounds were at the time of trial reserved for whites only, and the remainder were set aside for Negro use. Thirty of the 56 playgrounds and other facilities operated by the municipal Park Commission on property owned by churches, private groups, or the School Board were set aside for the exclusive use of whites, while 26 were reserved for Negroes. All 12 of the municipal community centers were segregated, eight being available only to whites and four to Negroes. Only two of the seven city golf courses were open to Negroes; play on the remaining five was limited to whites. While several of these properties have been desegregated since the filing of suit, the general pattern of racial segregation in such public recreational facilities persists.7\n\n\n14\nThe city asserted in the court below, and states here, that its good faith in attempting to comply with the requirements of the Constitution is not in issue, and contends that gradual desegregation on a facility-by-facility basis is necessary to prevent interracial disturbances, violence, riots, and community confusion and turmoil. The compelling answer to this contention is that constitutional rights may not be denied simply because of hostility to their assertion or exercise. See Wright v. Georgia, 373 U.S. 284, 83 S.Ct. 1240; Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 300, 75 S.Ct. 753, 756, 99 L.Ed. 1083. Cf. Taylor v. Louisiana, 370 U.S. 154, 82 S.Ct. 1188, 8 L.Ed.2d 395. As declared in Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 16, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 1409, 3 L.Ed.2d 5, 'law and order are not * * * to be preserved by depriving the Negro children of their constitutional rights.' This is really no more than an application of a principle enunciated much earlier in Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U.S. 60, 38 S.Ct. 16, 62 L.Ed. 149, a case dealing with a somewhat different form of state-ordained segregation\u2014enforced separation of Negroes and whites by neighborhood. A unanimous Court, in striking down the officially imposed pattern of racial segregation there in question, declared almost a half century ago:\n\n\n15\n'It is urged that this proposed segregation will promote the      public peace by preventing race conflicts. Desirable as this      is, and important as is the preservation of the public peace, this aim cannot be      accomplished by laws or ordinances which deny rights created      or protected by the federal Constitution.' 245 U.S., at 81,      38 S.Ct., at 20, 62 L.Ed. 149.\n\n\n16\nBeyond this, however, neither the asserted fears of violence and tumult nor the asserted inability to preserve the peace was demonstrated at trial to be anything more than personal speculations or vague disquietudes of city officials. There is no indication that there had been any violence or meaningful disturbances when other recreational facilities had been desegregated. In fact, the only evidence in the record was that such prior transitions had been peaceful.8 The Chairman of the Memphis Park Commission indicated that the city had 'been singularly blessed by the absence of turmoil up to this time on this race question'; notwithstanding the prior desegregation of numerous recreational facilities, the same witness could point as evidence of the unrest or turmoil which would assertedly occur upon complete desegregation of such facilities only to a number of anonymous letters and phone calls which he had received. The Memphis Chief of Police mentioned without further description some 'troubles' at the time bus service was desegregated and referred to threatened violence in connection with a 'sit-in' demonstration at a local store, but, beyond making general predictions, gave no concrete indication of any inability of authorities to maintain the peace. The only violence referred to at any park or recreational facility occurred in segregated parks and was not the product of attempts at desegregation. Moreover, there was no factual evidence to support the bare testimonial speculations that authorities would be unable to cope successfully with any problems which in fact might arise or to meet the need for additional protection should the occasion demand.\n\n\n17\nThe existing and commendable goodwill between the races in Memphis, to which both the District Court and some of the witnesses at trial made express and emphatic reference as in some inexplicable fashion supporting the need for further delay, can best be preserved and extended by the observance and protection, not the denial, of the basic constitutional rights here asserted. The best guarantee of civil peace is adherence to, and respect for, the law.\n\n\n18\nThe other justifications for delay urged by the city or relied upon by the courts below are no more substantial, either legally or practically. It was, for example, asserted that immediate desegregation of playgrounds and parks would deprive a number of children\u2014both Negro and white\u2014of recreational facilities; this contention was apparently based on the premise that a number of such facilities would have to be closed because of the inadequacy of the 'present' park budget to provide additional 'supervision' assumed to be necessary to operate unsegregated playgrounds. As already noted, however, there is no warrant in this record for assuming that such added supervision would, in fact, be required, much less that police and recreation personnel would be unavailable to meet such needs if they should arise.9 More significantly, however, it is obvious that vindication of conceded constitutional rights cannot be made dependent upon any theory that it is less expensive to deny than to afford them. We will not assume that the citizens of Memphis accept the questionable premise implicit in this argument or that either the resources of the city are inadequate, or its government unresponsive, to the needs of all of its citizens.\n\n\n19\nIn support of its judgment, the District Court also pointed out that the recreational facilities available for Negroes were roughly proportional to their number and therefore presumably adequate to meet their needs.10 While the record does not clearly support this, no more need be said than that, even if true, it reflects an impermissible obeisance to the now thoroughly discredited doctrine of 'separate but equal.' The sufficiency of Negro facilities is beside the point; it is the segregation by race that is unconstitutional.\n\n\n20\nFinally, the District Court deferred ruling as to the propriety of ordering elimination of racial barriers at one facility, an art museum, pending initiation of, and decision in, a state court action to construe a racially restrictive covenant contained in the deed of the property to the city. Of course, the outcome of the state suit is irrelevant to whether the city may constitutionally enforce the segregation, regardless of the effect which desegregation may have on its title. Cf. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Board of Trusts, 353 U.S. 230, 77 S.Ct. 806, 1 L.Ed.2d 792. In any event, there is no reason to believe that the restrictive provision will be invoked. The museum has already been opened to Negroes one day a week without complaint.11\n\n\n21\nSince the city has completely failed to demonstrate any compelling or convincing reason requiring further delay in implementing the constitutional proscription of segregation of publicly owned or operated recreational facilities there is no cause whatsoever to depart from the generally operative and here clearly controlling principle that constitutional rights are to be promptly vindicated. The continued denial to petitioners of the use of city facilities solely because of their race is without warrant. Under the facts in this case, the District Court's undoubted discretion in the fashioning and timing of equitable relief was not called into play; rather, affirmative judicial action was required to vindicate plain and present constitutional rights. Today, no less than 50 years ago, the solution to the problems growing out of race relations 'cannot be promoted by depriving citizens of their constitutional rights and privileges,' Buchanan v. Warley, supra, 245 U.S., at 80\u201481, 38 S.Ct., at 20, 62 L.Ed. 149.\n\n\n22\nThe judgment below must be and is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.\n\n\n23\nReversed.\n\n\n\n1\n The plan ultimately formulated, though not part of the record here, was described in oral argument before the Court of Appeals. It does not provide for complete desegregation of all facilities until 1971.\n\n\n2\n See, e.g., Dawson v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 4 Cir., 220 F.2d 386, aff'd, 350 U.S. 877, 76 S.Ct. 133, 100 L.Ed. 774 (beaches and bathhouses); New Orleans City Park Improvement Assn. v. Detiege, 5 Cir., 252 F.2d 122, aff'd, 358 U.S. 54, 79 S.Ct. 99, 3 L.Ed.2d 46 (golf courses and other facilities); City of St. Petersburg v. Alsup, 5 Cir., 238 F.2d 830 (beach and swimming pools); Tate v. Department of Conservation and Development, D.C., 133 F.Supp. 53, aff'd 4 Cir., 231 F.2d 615, cert. denied, 352 U.S. 838, 77 S.Ct. 58, 1 L.Ed.2d 56 (parks); Moorhead v. City of Fort Lauderdale, D.C., 152 F.Supp. 131, aff'd, 5 Cir., 248 F.2d 544 (golf course); Fayson v. Beard, D.C., 134 F.Supp. 379 (parks); Holley v. City of Portsmouth, D.C., 150 F.Supp. 6 (golf course); Ward v. City of Miami, D.C., 151 F.Supp. 593 (golf course); Willie v. Harris County, D.C., 202 F.Supp. 549 (park). It is noteworthy that in none of these cases was the possibility of delay in effecting desegregation even considered.\n\n\n3\n The factors set out by the Court in the second Brown decision were 'problems related to administration, arising from the physical condition of the school plant, the school transportation system, personnel, revision of school districts and attendance areas into compact units to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis, and revision of local laws and regulations which may be necessary in solving the foregoing problems.' 349 U.S., at 300\u2014301, 75 S.Ct., at 756, 99 L.Ed. 1083.\n\n\n4\n Recognition of the possible need for delay has not even been extended to desegregation of state colleges or universities in which like problems were not presented. See, e.g., Florida ex rel. Hawkins v. Board of Control, 350 U.S. 413, 76 S.Ct. 464, 100 L.Ed. 486, where, in remanding on the authority of Brown, this Court said that '(a)s this case involves the admission of a Negro to a graduate professional school, there is no reason for delay. He is entitled to prompt admission under the rules and regulations applicable to other qualified candidates.' 350 U.S., at 414, 76 S.Ct. 464, 100 L.Ed. 486. See also Lucy v. Adams, 350 U.S. 1, 76 S.Ct. 33, 100 L.Ed. 3. Similarly, both before and after Brown, delay has neither been suggested nor countenanced in eliminating operation of racial barriers with respect to transportation, e.g., Boynton v. Virginia, 364 U.S. 454, 81 S.Ct. 182, 5 L.Ed.2d 206; Henderson v. United States, 339 U.S. 816, 70 S.Ct. 843, 94 L.Ed. 1302; Morgan v. Virginia, 328 U.S. 373, 66 S.Ct. 1050, 90 L.Ed. 1317; Browder v. Gayle, D.C., 142 F.Supp. 707, aff'd, 352 U.S. 903, 77 S.Ct. 145, 1 L.Ed.2d 114; voting, e.g., Schnell v. Davis, 336 U.S. 933, 69 S.Ct. 749, 93 L.Ed. 1093; Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649, 64 S.Ct. 757, 88 L.Ed. 987; racial zoning of property, e.g., City of Richmond v. Deans, 281 U.S. 704, 50 S.Ct. 407, 74 L.Ed. 1128; Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U.S. 60, 38 S.Ct. 16, 62 L.Ed. 149; or employment rights and union representation, e.g., Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Howard, 343 U.S. 768, 72 S.Ct. 1022, 96 L.Ed. 1283.\n\n\n5\n This principle was well established even under the now discarded 'separate but equal' doctrine. See, e.g., McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, 339 U.S. 637, 642, 70 S.Ct. 851, 854, 94 L.Ed. 1149; Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629, 635, 70 S.Ct. 848, 850\u2014851, 94 L.Ed. 1114; Sipuel v. Board of Regents of University of Oklahoma, 332 U.S. 631, 632\u2014633, 68 S.Ct. 299, 300, 92 L.Ed. 247. See also Florida ex rel. Hawkins v. Board of Control, 350 U.S. 413, 414, 76 S.Ct. 464, 465, 100 L.Ed. 486, and notes 2 and 4, supra.\n\n\n6\n These figures, and others referred to in the text, apparently represent the total extent of progress, as of the time of trial, toward desegregation of recreational facilities since this Court's decision eight years ago outlawing the practices here in question. So far as appears, none of the relevant facilities were open for use without regard to race prior to 1955, and, in fact, several new parks have been opened on a segregated basis since that time.\n\n\n7\n It is not entirely clear precisely how many properties have since trial actually been desegregated and how many were merely changed from 'white-only' to 'Negro-only' use in line with changes in neighborhood racial composition.\n\n\n8\n Nor, contrary to predictions, does it appear that violence or disruption of any kind ensued upon elimination of racial barriers to use of certain additional facilities subsequent to trial.\n\n\n9\n Except for the mention of some extra policemen assigned to duty at the city zoo, no showing was made even that additional supervision was necessary or provided at facilities which had been desegregated previously.\n\n\n10\n Approximately 37% of Memphis' 500,000 residents are Negroes; contrary to the apparent assumption of the trial court, the recreational facilities available to Negroes were not at the time of trial all quantitatively proportional to their number and their complete or partial exclusion from certain other facilities evidenced a substantial qualitative difference. Moreover, there was testimony from Negro witnesses that they were excluded from golf courses and playgrounds more convenient to their places of residence than other like facilities open to them.\n\n\n11\n The city also asserted in the District Court that delay was supported by the fact that desegregation of the Fairgrounds would result in a substantial loss of revenues therefrom and would be unfair to contract concessionaires. This claim appears to have been mooted by the intervening elimination of racial restrictions at that facility, seemingly without difficulty.\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"425 U.S. 231\n96 S.Ct. 1399\n47 L.Ed.2d 701\nMarcel YOUAKIM et al., Appellants,v.Jerome MILLER, Individually and as Director of the  Department of Children and Family Services, et al.\nNo. 73-6935.\nMarch 31, 1976.\n\nPatrick A. Keenan, DePaul Law Clinic, Chicago, Ill., for plaintiffs-appellants.\nWilliam J. Scott, Atty. Gen., Chicago, Ill. (Paul J. Bargiel, Asst. Atty. Gen., Chicago, Ill., of counsel), for defendants-appellees.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nAs part of the federal Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 601 Et seq., the State of Illinois provides federally subsidized foster care (AFDC-FC) payments of $105 per month for a dependent child placed with unrelated foster parents. Under Illinois' administration of the program no foster care payments are made to foster parents who are related to the foster child. Related foster parents are eligible, however, to receive payments under the State's regular AFDC program for the support of dependent children in the amount of $63 per month. These payments are made without regard to the financial circumstances of the family caring for the child. In addition, as an exception to the State's regular policy, related foster parents, upon an adequate showing of financial need, may receive supplemental payments for child care which bring the payments in connection with the related foster child to approximately $105 per month.\n\n\n2\nAppellants are Linda Youakim and her husband, Marcel, and Linda's four minor brothers and sisters, Timothy, Mary Lou, Larry, and Sherry Robertson. Since 1972, the Youakims have been foster parents of Timothy and Mary Lou. Larry and Sherry have been living in separate, unrelated foster care facilities since 1969. Because Linda is related to Timothy and Mary Lou, the Youakims were ineligible for AFDC-FC foster care payments. They did apply for and receive the smaller AFDC payments for both children. Alleging injury resulting from financial inability to provide adequate care for Timothy and Mary Lou and to bring Larry and Sherry into their foster family, appellants filed suit in the District Court against the state officials on behalf of themselves and all other persons similarly situated. Their complaint described the suit as an action to enjoin enforcement of the foster care payment scheme on the ground that it denied related foster families the equal protection of the laws and likewise discriminated against wards of the State and relatives who could not provide an adequate foster home without full foster care payments. They asked that a three-judge District Court convene and enjoin the enforcement of the Illinois statutes and regulations.\n\n\n3\nThe three-judge court \"approved\" the Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 23(b)(2) class, granted appellees' motion for summary judgment, and ultimately held that the \"Illinois scheme does not deny plaintiffs equal protection of the laws.\" 374 F.Supp. 1204, 1210 (N.D.Ill.1974). The jurisdictional statement filed here expressly challenged the Illinois scheme both on equal protection grounds and on the ground of conflict with the Social Security Act. We noted probable jurisdiction. 420 U.S. 970, 95 S.Ct. 1389, 43 L.Ed.2d 650 (1975).\n\n\n4\nAlthough the jurisdictional statement as to which we noted probable jurisdiction presented the question of conflict between the Illinois law and the Social Security Act, it appears that the Supremacy Clause claim was not presented to the District Court as an independent ground for invalidating the state law. The complaint described the suit as one seeking an injunction on equal protection grounds. The sole ground for relief expressly claimed in each of the three causes of action which the complaint purported to allege, as well as in the prayer for relief, was that the Illinois program denied appellants equal protection of the laws. It does not appear from the record in the District Court that as the case developed appellants rested on the Supremacy Clause as a separate basis for their injunction claim. Nor did the District Court address the relationship between state and federal law independently of the equal protection issue.\n\n\n5\n[1] Ordinarily, this Court does not decide questions not raised or resolved in the lower court. California v. Taylor, 353 U.S. 553, 557 n. 2, 77 S.Ct. 1037, 1039-40, 1 L.Ed.2d 1034, 1037 (1957); Lawn v. United States, 355 U.S. 339, 362-363, n. 16, 78 S.Ct. 311, 324, 2 L.Ed.2d 321, 337 (1958). But as Pollard v. United States, 352 U.S. 354, 359, 77 S.Ct. 481, 484-85, 1 L.Ed.2d 393, 397-98 (1957), and Brotherhood of Carpenters v. United States, 330 U.S. 395, 412, 67 S.Ct. 775, 784, 91 L.Ed. 973, 987 (1947), for example, demonstrate, the rule is not inflexible. Cf. Boynton v. Virginia, 364 U.S. 454, 457, 81 S.Ct. 182, 184, 5 L.Ed.2d 206, 209-10 (1960). Its usual formulation is: \"It is only in exceptional cases coming here from the federal courts that questions not pressed or passed upon below are reviewed.\" Duignan v. United States, 274 U.S. 195, 200, 47 S.Ct. 566, 568, 71 L.Ed. 996, 1000 (1927). Here, as we shall describe, the circumstances justify our dealing with the issue of conflict between state and federal statutes at least to the extent of vacating the judgment below and remanding the case for consideration of the claim that the Illinois foster care program is in conflict with the Social Security Act.\n\n\n6\nInitially, it should be noted that the statutory issue is not foreign to the subject matter of the complaint. Attacks on state welfare statutes often combine Equal Protection Clause and Supremacy Clause issues. The latter question could surely have been pursued under the complaint filed in this case, which, as part of the \"facts\" incorporated by reference in each of the three causes of action, alleged that the Illinois program was in conflict with the policy of the United States expressed in subchapter IV of the Social Security Act, 49 Stat. 627, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 601 et seq., specifically with the federal policy of encouraging the care of children in their own homes or in the homes of relatives wherever possible.\n\n\n7\nIt is also apparent that the District Court was of the view that under Townsend v. Swank, 404 U.S. 282, 92 S.Ct. 502, 30 L.Ed.2d 448 (1971), \"serious equal protection problems\" might arise if \"a state attempts to rely on the concept of fiscal integrity to limit beyond federal statutory standards the class eligible to receive federally subsidized payments.\" 374 F.Supp., at 1210. For this reason,he District Court compared federal and state law, and concluded: \"Far from being inconsistent with the federal scheme, the Illinois scheme in general seems to parallel it. . . . Thus the federal statute makes the same classification as the Illinois statute.\" Ibid. Had appellants relied on the Supremacy Clause issue as a separate ground for decision it would appear that the claim would have been rejected by the District Court. In light of these circumstances, the case is at most only marginally subject to the rule that this Court will not consider issues \"not pressed or passed upon\" in the court below.\n\n\n8\nBeyond these considerations, on October 25, 1974, after the filing of the jurisdictional statement but before we noted probable jurisdiction, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare issued Program Instruction APA-PI-75-9 stating that under the controlling federal law, \"(w)hen a child has been removed from his home by judicial determination and is placed in foster care under the various conditions specified . . ., the foster care rate of payment prevails regardless of whether or not the foster home is operated by a relative.\" Also, in response to appellants' jurisdictional statement, the Solicitor General filed a statement in this Court urging that the Illinois foster care program was inconsistent with the Social Security Act insofar as it provided higher payments to related foster parents than to those who were not related. Neither the appellants nor the District Court had the benefit of either of these developments when the case was in the lower court. The interpretation of a statute by an agency charged with its enforcement is a substantial factor to be considered in construing the statute, New York Dept. of Social Services v. Dublino, 4 U.S. 405, 421, 93 S.Ct. 2507, 2516-17, 37 L.Ed.2d 688, 699 (1973); Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic Comm., 412 U.S. 94, 121, 93 S.Ct. 2080, 2095-96, 36 L.Ed.2d 772, 794 (1973); Investment Co. Institute v. Camp, 401 U.S. 617, 626-627, 91 S.Ct. 1091, 1097, 28 L.Ed.2d 367, 376-77 (1971); and appellants1 now wish to press the issue of conflict between state and federal law. We think that it is appropriate to afford them the opportunity to do so, but that the claim should be aired first in the District Court. Vacating the judgment and remanding the case for this purpose will require the District Court first to decide the statutory issue, Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974), and if appellants prevail on that question, it will be unnecessary for either the District Court or this Court to reach the equal protection issue at all. A remand is thus consistent with our usual practice of avoiding decisions on constitutional matters if a case may be resolved on other grounds.2\n\n\n9\nThe action we take here is similar to the order the Court entered in Thorpe v. Housing Authority, 386 U.S. 670, 87 S.Ct. 1244, 18 L.Ed.2d 394 (1967). There, rather than deciding the constitutionality of an eviction from a public housing project, the Court remanded the case for reconsideration in light of a supervening administrative directive which was issued by federal authorities and which it was thought might provide a nonconstitutional basis for decision. Cf. Richardson v. Wright, 405 U.S. 208, 209, 92 S.Ct. 788, 789-90, 31 L.Ed.2d 151, 153-54 (1972).\n\n\n10\nThe judgment of the District Court is vacated, and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n11\nSo ordered.\n\n\n12\nJudgment vacated and case remanded.\n\n\n13\nMr. Justice STEVENS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n\n1\n The appellee state officials have met both of appellants' claims on the merits and have not sought to restrict our review to the equal protection issue.\n\n\n2\n From papers lodged with the Court, it appears, and appellants do not dispute, that since September 1, 1974, the Youakims have been receiving need-based payments supplementing the AFDC payments for Timothy and Mary Lou. They now receive monthly payments totaling $105, the same amount they would receive under the AFDC-FC program. Their receipt of these payments does not moot the case. The complaint alleged that ineligibility for regular foster care payments had precluded the Youakims \"from even considering accepting for foster care the (two) other family members\" who are living with nonrelatives in other foster care facilities. App. 12. Were it not for the Illinois program, they allege, the Youakims could seek to bring Larry and Sherry into their foster home and would receive the same monthly $105 AFDC-FC payments per child received as a matter of course by the foster care facilities now caring for Larry and Sherry without any showing of need and without applying for need-based funds supplementing the $63 AFDC payments. Whatever its strength, the Youakims' claim that it is unlawful to require them to demonstrate need and to rely on an exception to policy in order to receive the same child care payments is not mooted by current receipt of larger payments for Timothy and Mary Lou who are living in the Youakim home. Because we conclude that the case is not moot as to the Youakims, we need not decide whether the District Court properly identified the Rule 23(b)(2) class, compare Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975), with Indianapolis School Comm'rs v. Jacobs, 420 U.S. 128, 95 S.Ct. 848, 43 L.Ed.2d 74 (1975), so that the class action might be maintained notwithstanding mootness as to the named plaintiffs, or whether appellant Linda Youakim properly sued as \"next friend\" of her four brothers and sisters, see Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 17(c), so that their constitutional interests could be adjudicated by the court.\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"361 U.S. 529\n80 S.Ct. 450\n4 L.Ed.2d 490\nGeorge B. PETITE, Petitioner,v.UNITED STATES of America.\nNo. 45.\nDecided Feb. 23, 1960.\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner was indicted, with others, in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for conspiring to make false statements to an agency of the United States at hearings held in Philadelphia and Baltimore under proceedings for the deportation of an alien. Petitioner was also separately indicted for suborning perjury at the Philadelphia hearings.  Petitioner's co-defendants pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charged. Petitioner went to trial on both indictments, but at the close of the Government's case he changed his plea to nolo contendere to the conspiracy charge, and the Government dismissed the subornation indictment. He was fined $500 and sentenced to two months' imprisonment, which he served. Petitioner was subsequently indicted in the District of Maryland for suborning the perjury of two witnesses at the Baltimore hearings. Among the overt acts which had been relied upon in the Pennsylvania conspiracy indictment was the testimony of these two witnesses. Because of this, petitioner moved to dismiss the Maryland indictment on the ground of double jeopardy, but his motion was denied, D.C., 147 F.Supp. 791, and the conviction which resulted was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, 262 F.2d 788.\n\n\n2\nThereupon a petition for a writ of certiorari was filed with the double jeopardy issue as the single question presented, and certiorari was granted. 360 U.S. 908, 79 S.Ct. 1293, 3 L.Ed.2d 1259. The Government did not oppose the granting of this petition, but informed the Court that the case was under consideration by the Department of Justice to determine whether the second prosecution in the District of Maryland was consistent with the sound policy of the Department in discharging its responsibility for the control of government litigation wholly apart from the question of the legal validity of the claim of double jeopardy.\n\n\n3\nIn due course the Government filed this motion for an order vacating the judgment below and remanding the case to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland with directions to dismiss the indictment. It did so on the ground that it is the general policy of the Federal Government 'that several offenses arising out of a single transaction should be alleged and tried together and should not be made the basis of multiple prosecutions, a policy dictated by considerations both of fairness to defendants and of efficient and orderly law enforcement.' The Solicitor General on behalf of the Government represents this policy as closely related to that against duplicating federal-state prosecutions, which was formally defined by the Attorney General of the United States in a memorandum to the United States Attorneys. (Department of Justice Press Release, Apr. 6, 1959.) Counsel for petitioner 'joins in and consents' to the Government's motion.\n\n\n4\nThe case is remanded to the Court of Appeals to vacate its judgment and to direct the District Court to vacate its judgment and to dismiss the indictment. In the interest of justice, the Court is clearly empowered thus to dispose of the matter, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2106, and we do so with due regard for the settled rule that the Court will not 'anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it.' Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S.S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113 U.S. 33, 39, 5 S.Ct. 352, 355, 28 L.Ed. 899. By thus disposing of the matter, we are of course not to be understood as remotely intimating in any degree an opinion on the question of double jeopardy sought to be presented by the petition for certiorari.\n\n\n5\nCase remanded with directions.\n\n\n6\nMr. Chief Justice WARREN, concurring.\n\n\n7\nI concur with the judgment of the Court, but desire to record my reasons for so doing.\n\n\n8\nThe Solicitor General, who has statutory authority to conduct litigation in this Court,1 has requested us to vacate the judgment and remand for dismissal in the interests of justice. The petitioner has consented. Under these circumstances, I believe that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2106, empowers us to entertain the motion.2\n\n\n9\nAuthority to grant this type of motion is one thing, however, and determination of the considerations relevant to a proper exercise of that authority is another. As I believe that the Court should not deny all such motions peremptorily, so do I believe that we should not automatically grant them through invocation of the policy of avoiding decision of constitutional issues. There are circumstances in which our responsibility of definitively interpreting the law of the land and of supervising its judicial application would dictate that we dispose of a case on its merits. In a situation, for example, where the invalidity of the judgment is clear and the motion to vacate and remand is obviously a means of avoiding an adjudication, I think we would be remiss in our duty were we to grant the motion.\n\n\n10\nBut this is not such a case. Although a full hearing might well establish petitioner's contention that his conviction violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution, Amend. 5, no devious purpose can be ascribed to the Government, which asserts that the prosecution of petitioner 'was * * * by inadvertence,' and that it 'does not intend to take (such action) in the future.' Its representation with respect to future practice is given support by the Attorney General's memorandum to United States Attorneys which establishes a closely related policy against successive federal-state prosecutions; and the reasonableness of its request is demonstrated by the fact that this memorandum was issued after the prosecution, the conviction, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case. For these reasons the action requested is, in the words of \u00a7 2106, 'just under the circumstances.'   Mr. Justice BRENNAN, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice DOUGLAs join.\n\n\n11\nThe Government has commendably done the just and right thing in asking us to wipe the slate clean of this second federal conviction for the same criminal conduct. But with all deference, I do not see how our duty can be fully performed in this case if our action stops with simply giving effect to a 'policy' of the Government\u2014a policy whose only written expression does not even cover the case at bar. Even where the Government confesses error, this Court examines the case on the merits itself, Young v. United States, 315 U.S. 257, 258\u2014259, 62 S.Ct. 510, 511\u2014512, 86 L.Ed. 832, and one would not have thought our duty less in this case particularly where the Government has reserved the right to apply or not apply its 'policy' in its discretion. Presumably this reservation would apply to cases at the appellate level as well. '(T)he proper administration of the criminal law cannot be left merely to the stipulation of parties.' Id., 315 U.S. at page 259, 62 S.Ct. at page 511. I believe that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment was an insurmountable barrier to this second prosecution. My reasons supporting this view have been detailed in my separate opinion in Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S. 187, 196, 79 S.Ct. 666, 671, 3 L.Ed.2d 729. On this basis I agree that the judgment of the Court of Appeals is not to stand; but I would reverse it on the merits.\n\n\n\n1\n 1 Stat. 92, 16 Stat. 162; R.S. \u00a7 359; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 309, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 309.\n\n\n2\n Section 2106 reads as follows:\n'The Supreme Court or any other court of appellate jurisdiction may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside or reverse any judgment, decree, or order of a court lawfully brought before it for review, and may remand the cause and direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.'\n\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"353 U.S. 373\n77 S.Ct. 995\n1 L.Ed.2d 918\nSam ACHILLI, Petitioner,v.UNITED STATES of America.\nNos. 430, 834.\nArgued May 2, 1957.\nDecided May 27, 1957.\nRehearing Denied June 24, 1957.\n\nSee 354 U.S. 943, 77 S.Ct. 1391, 1394.\nPeter B. Atwood, Chicago, Ill., for the petitioner.\nCharles K. Rice, Washington, D.C., for the respondent.\nMr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nPetitioner was charged in a three-count indictment under \u00a7 145(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 145(b), with the felony of wilfully attempting to evade federal income taxes by filing a false return.1 Upon conviction, he was sentenced to concurrent two-year prison terms and was fined $2,000 on each count. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the conviction on count one, but affirmed the convictions on counts two and three. 234 F.2d 797. We granted certiorari limited to a question of general importance in the enforcement of the income tax, namely, whether petitioner could be prosecuted and sentenced under \u00a7 145(b) for an offense claimed by him to be punishable also under \u00a7 3616(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3616(a). 352 U.S. 1023, 77 S.Ct. 588, 1 L.Ed.2d 595.2\n\n\n2\nThe threshold question is whether the conduct for which petitioner was convicted was an offense under s 3616(a). That section made it a misdemeanor for any person to deliver to the Collector 'any false or fraudulent list, return, account, or statement, with intent to defeat or evade the valuation, enumeration, or assessment intended to be made * * *' and provided maximum penalties of one year in prison and a $1,000 fine, together with the costs of prosecution. 53 Stat. 440. If the wilful filing of a false income tax return was not embraced by \u00a7 3616(a), petitioner's case falls, and discussion of other issues becomes unnecessary.\n\n\n3\nUnlike \u00a7 145(b), which appeared in the income tax chapter of the 1939 Code and was specifically and restrictively designed to punish evasion of that tax, \u00a7 3616(a) was placed among the Code's 'General Administrative Provisions' and was general in scope. Failure explicitly to exclude evasion of the income tax from the scope of \u00a7 3616(a) is urged as ground for its inclusion, thereby making it a misdemeanor to file a false return with intent to evade the income tax, despite the specific felony provision of \u00a7 145(b).\n\n\n4\nAs long ago as 1926 it was the Government's position that the predecessor of \u00a7 145(b) effectively repealed \u00a7 3616(a)'s applicability to income tax evasion. See brief for the United States pp. 16\u201419, in United States v. Noveck, 273 U.S. 202, 47 S.Ct. 341, 71 L.Ed. 610. To be sure, during the last five years, the Government prosecuted a small number of minor offenses, we are told less than seven per cent of the criminal income tax evasion cases involving the filing of false returns, as misdemeanors under \u00a7 3616(a). More recently, a series of cases brought the relation of \u00a7 145(b) to \u00a7 3616(a) into focus and called for an interpretative analysis of the history of these sections in order to ascertain their respective functions. And so now, for the first time, has the Government made a detailed survey of the problem of alleged overlapping between \u00a7 3616(a) and \u00a7 145(b).\n\n\n5\nSection 3616(a) goes back to the Act of 1798, 1 Stat. 580, 586, when excise taxes and customs duties were the main sources of federal revenue. Being general in scope, this section, as successively re-enacted, was applicable to the first federal taxes on income from 1861 to 1871, and again in 1894; there were no separate provisions for punishing income tax evasions. See, e.g., the Act of 1861, 12 Stat. 292, 309; the Act of 1894, 28 Stat. 509, 553.\n\n\n6\nA different story begins with the income tax legislation that followed the passage of the Sixteenth Amendment. Section II of the Revenue Act of 1913, 38 Stat. 114, 166, contained its own criminal sanctions. Section II(F) proscribed the making of a false return with intent to evade the income tax, an act that would otherwise have been punishable under what was then \u00a7 3179 of the Revised Statutes of 1874, the immediate predecessor of \u00a7 3616(a). The offense would have been a misdemeanor under either statute. But \u00a7 II(F) provided a maximum fine of $2,000 while \u00a7 3179 only permitted a fine of up to $1,000. It seems clear that \u00a7 II(F) displaced \u00a7 3179. Such implied repeal, pro tanto, is further demonstrated by the fact that \u00a7\u00a7 3167, 3172, 3173 and 3176 of the Revised Statutes, related provisions in the enforcement of the revenue laws, were specifically incorporated, as modified, into \u00a7 II, but \u00a7 3179 was not. Nor was it incorporated by reference; \u00a7 II(L) made applicable only those administrative and general tax provisions 'not inconsistent with the provisions of this section,' and \u00a7 3179 was obviously inconsistent with \u00a7 II(F).\n\n\n7\nThe Revenue Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 756, 775, and the Act of 1917, 40 Stat. 300, 325, offer further evidence that Congress withdrew the income tax from the reach of the general provisions of \u00a7 3179. Both of those Acts imposed income taxes, proscribed the making of false returns as a misdemeanor, and punished that offense more severely than did \u00a7 3179.3 In addition to its specific prohibition of false returns, the 1917 Act made it an offense to evade or attempt to evade taxes imposed by it, thereby using for the first time language similar to that subsequently found in \u00a7 145(b).\n\n\n8\nIn an effort to escape the effect of the scheme for punishing income tax evaders set forth in the 1913, 1916, and 1917 statutes, petitioner claims that the Revenue Act of 1918 made \u00a7 3179 again applicable to the income tax. Section 253 of Title II, the income tax title, provided in pertinent part:\n\n\n9\n'Any individual * * * who willfully refuses to pay or collect      such (required) tax, to make such return, or to supply such      information at the time or times required under this title,      or who willfully attempts in any manner to defeat or evade      the tax imposed by this title, shall be guilty of a      misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than $10,000 or      imprisoned for not more than one year, or both * * *.' 40      Stat. 1057, 1085.\n\n\n10\nDespite \u00a7 253's addition of the words 'in any manner' to the 'attempts' clause of the 1917 Act, petitioner contends that the failure of \u00a7 253 to single out the making of false returns with intent to evade must be attributed to a congressional determination that this particular mode of imcome tax evasion should be punished under \u00a7 3179. Plainly enough, such a reading of the Act is untenable. We cannot hold that the classic method of evading the income tax, the filing of a false return, did not constitute an attenpt 'in any manner to defeat or evade' that tax. This would empty those words of their most obvious content and would produce glaring incongruities. It would mean that Congress, having manifested its desire in the previous revenue laws to punish this offense more harshly than did \u00a7 3179, inexplicably reversed itself in an Act that heavily increased the punishment for all other forms of obstruction to the income tax. And it would mean that Congress provided a lesser penalty for the making of false returns with intent to evade than for either wilful refusal to file, which is usually considered to be a lesser offense, or refusal to file when combined with affirmative acts of evasion such as keeping a double set of books. An explanation of the omission more in harmony with the rational system of tax administration that was the congressional design is that Congress merely tried to speak economically in 1918 and, having prohibited 'attempts in any manner' to evade the income tax, found it unnecessary also to proscribe the major kind of attempt.\n\n\n11\nThis interpretation gains further support from the Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 343, which made the last significant alteration of the statutory scheme prior to the 1939 codification. Section 1017(a), subsequently \u00a7 145(a) of the Code, continued the wilful failure to make returns, supply information or pay taxes as a misdemeanor carrying a penalty of up to one year in prison and a $10,000 fine. Section 1017(b), the future \u00a7 145(b), made if a felony, with a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine, to attempt 'in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this Act.' And \u00a7 1017(c), later \u00a7 3793(b) (1) of the Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3793(b)(1), created a new offense, which made it a felony, with a maximum penalty of five years in prison and $10,000 fine, for any person wilfully to assist in the preparation of a false return. Thus the 1924 Act, by increasing the punishment for affirmative acts of evasion, made even more pronounced one of the indicated anomalies that petitioner's view would impose. In addition, \u00a7 1017(c) requires petitioner to impute to Congress a desire to punish one who assisted in preparing a false return much more severely than one who actually made the return with intent to evade.\n\n\n12\nOur duty is to give coherence to what Congress has done within the bounds imposed by a fair reading of legislation. In Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492, 63 S.Ct. 364, 87 L.Ed. 418, the dominant consideration in the Court's unanimous decision relating \u00a7 145(b) to \u00a7 145(a) was the avoidance of incongruities analogous to those that would result from petitioner's reading of the sections before us. The evolution of those sections makes clear that by the time the unconfined language of \u00a7 3179 became \u00a7 3616(a) of the 1939 Code, its scope had been shrunk by a series of specific enactments that had the potency of implied repeals. Due regard for appropriate statutory construction calls for such a conclusion in order to harmonize an earlier, generalized statute with later ad hoc enactments expressly directed to the collection of income taxes.\n\n\n13\nIn view of our conclusion that \u00a7 3616(a) did not apply to evasion of the income tax, it becomes unnecessary to consider other contentions advanced by petitioner.\n\n\n14\nAffirmed.\n\n\n15\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice CLARK concur in the result.\n\n\n16\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK concurs, dissenting.\n\n\n17\nI do not see how we can say that Congress withdrew the income tax from the reach of \u00a7 3616(a). In the 1939 Internal Revenue Code that section was part of Subchapter B, 'Determination of Tax Liability,' which was a part of chapter 34, 'Information and Returns,' which in turn was part of Subtitle D, 'GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS.' SECTIOn 61 mADe applicable tO the income tax provisions 'All administrative special, or stamp provisions of law, including the law relating to the assessment of taxes, so far as applicable * * *.' These administrative provisions include the chapter and subtitle of which \u00a7 3616(a) is a part. And by its terms \u00a7 3616(a) applies to 'any' return. Plainly then, Congress in 1939 considered \u00a7 3616(a) an instrument for enforcing the income tax.\n\n\n18\nIt takes mental gymnastics to bring this crime out from under \u00a7 3616(a) and to place it exclusively under \u00a7 145(b). I would not make the penal consequences of an Act turn on a construction so tenuous. I rebel against it, especially because the construction now adopted sweeps the ground out from under dozens of criminal convictions which the Government has obtained under \u00a7 3616(a). Between October 1952 and March 1957 (when the Government first suggested to this Court that \u00a7 3616(a) was inapplicable to the income tax) it invoked \u00a7 3616(a) in 175 cases of alleged income tax evasion. It chose \u00a7 3616(a), rather than \u00a7 145(b), where it appeared that the crime was a relatively minor one. Of these 175 cases, 38 remain undisposed of. Of the 133 that went to trial, 117 resulted in pleas of guilty and 9 in pleas of nolo contendere. Seven defendants went to trial, of whom 5 were acquitted and 2 convicted. Of the 128 convicted persons, 26 were sentenced to imprisonment, the rest being fined or given probation or suspended sentences. Seven of the convicted persons who were sentenced are still incarcerated.\n\n\n19\nNow it appears that the Government dealt unlawfully with this group of citizens. Those who were convicted on indictments might have to be resentenced. Those who were convicted on informations must be released.\n\n\n20\nIt is no answer to say that the result is 'a break' for these defendants. From the statistics submitted to us by the Government it appears that many of these cases were so minor it is difficult to imagine a ground jury returning indictments on them.\n\n\n21\nI would adhere to the administrative construction that \u00a7 3616(a) applied to the income tax. Congress apparently was of that view. For when it came to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.A., it re-enacted \u00a7 3616(a) as \u00a7 7207, eliminating the words 'with intent to defeat or evade' which had caused the overlap with \u00a7 145(b). Congress acted, of course, prospectively.\n\n\n22\nThe fact that Congress acted in 1954 to remove the ambiguity with which we deal today indicates that what we do is not within the judicial competence.\n\n\n\n1\n 'Sec. 145. Penalties\n'(a) Failure of file returns, submit information, or pay tax. Any person required under this chapter to pay any tax, or required by law or regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, for the purposes of the computation, assessment, or collection of any tax imposed by this chapter, who willfully fails to pay such tax, make such return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.\n'(b) Failure to collect and pay over tax, or attempt to defeat or evade tax. Any person required under this chapter to collect, account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this chapter, who willfully fails to collect or truthfully account for and pay over such tax, and any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this chapter or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.' 53 Stat. 62\u201463.\n\n\n2\n By the time certiorari was granted, petitioner's sentence had been reduced by the District Court to concurrent one-year prison terms and to a fine of $1,000 on each of the two affirmed counts. For further details of the history of the case, see 352 U.S. 916, 77 S.Ct. 214, 1 L.Ed.2d 122 and 353 U.S. 909, 77 S.Ct. 669, 1 L.Ed.2d 663.\n\n\n3\n The 1916 Act provided the same punishment as the Act of 1913. The 1917 Act provided, in addition to the maximum penalties set forth in \u00a7 3179, a penalty of double the tax evaded.\n\n\n","label":0}

McCanless, Atty. Gen. of Tennessee, and Paul E. Jennings, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\n1\nIn Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476, decided May 20, 1968, we overruled Delli Paoli v. United States, 352 U.S. 232, 77 S.Ct. 294, 1 L.Ed.2d 278 and held that, despite instructions to the jury to disregard the implicating statements in determining the codefendant's guilt or innocence, admission at a joint trial of a defendant's extrajudicial confession implicating a codefendant violated the codefendant's right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. This case presents the question whether Bruton is to be applied retroactively. We hold that it is.\n\n\n2\nThe facts parallel the facts in Bruton. The petitioner was convicted by a jury of armed robbery at a joint trial with one Rappe in Davidson County, Tennessee. A police officer testified that Rappe orally confessed to him that petitioner and Rappe committed the crime. The trial judge instructed the jury that Rappe's confession was admissible against her but that her statements implicating petitioner were not to be considered in determining petitioner's guilt or innocence. The Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction. Petitioner filed a proceeding in federal habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. That court relied on Delli Paoli and denied relief. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.\n\n\n3\nAlthough Bruton involved a federal prosecution and this is a state prosecution, the right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment is made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. Pointer v. State of Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923; Douglas v. State of Alabama, 380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934.\n\n\n4\n'We have * * * retroactively applied rules of criminal procedure fashioned to correct serious flaws in the fact-finding process at trial.' Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 298, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 1970, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199. See Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908; Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799; Reck v. Pate, 367 U.S. 433, 81 S.Ct. 1541, 6 L.Ed.2d 948; Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 639, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 1743, 14 L.Ed.2d 601; n. 20, Johnson v. State of New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 727\u2014728, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 1777\u20141778, 16 L.Ed.2d 882; cf. Brookhart v. Janis, 384 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314. Despite the cautionary instruction, the admission of a defendant's confession which implicates a codefendant results in such a 'serious flaw.' The retroactivity of the holding in Bruton is therefore required; the error 'went to the basis of fair hearing and trial because the procedural apparatus never assured the (petitioner) a fair determination' of his guilt or innocence. Linkletter v. Walker, supra, 381 U.S. at 639, 85 S.Ct. at 1743, n. 20. As we said in Bruton:\n\n\n5\n'(T)here are some contexts in which the risk that the jury      will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and the      consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the      practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored. * * * Such a context is      presented here, where the powerfully incriminating      extrajudicial statements of a codefendant * * * are      deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial.' 391      U.S., at 135\u2014136, 88 S.Ct., at 1627.\n\n\n6\nDue regard for countervailing considerations\u2014reliance on the old standard of Delli Paoli and the impact of retroactivity upon the administration of justice, Stovall v. Denno, supra, 388 U.S. at 298, 87 S.Ct. at 1970\u2014does not counsel against retroactivity of Bruton. The element of reliance is not persuasive, for Delli Paoli has been under attack from its inception and many courts have in fact rejected it. See Bruton v. United States, supra, 391 U.S., at 128\u2014135, 88 S.Ct., at 1623, and nn. 4, 8, 10. And even if the impact of retroactivity may be significant, the constitutional error presents a serious risk that the issue of guilt or innocence may not have been reliably determined.\n\n\n7\nThe motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for writ of certiorari are granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the case is remanded to the District Court for further consideration in light of Bruton v. United States, supra.\n\n\n8\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n9\nJudgment of Court of Appeals vacated and case remanded to District Court.\n\n\n10\nMr. Justice BLACK concurs in the Court's holding as to retroactivity for the reasons given in his dissent in Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 640, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 1743, and not for the reasons given in the Court's opinion today.\n\n\n11\nMr. Justice HARLAN and Mr. Justice WHITE dissent for the reasons stated in Mr. Justice WHITE'S dissenting opinion in Bruton v.

Louis Monarch, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nMr. Philip Elman, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\nMr. Justice MINTON delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThe petitioner was convicted by a jury on several counts charging willful evasion of the payment of federal income taxes. A matter admitted by the Government to have been handled by the trial court in a manner that may have been prejudicial to the petitioner, and therefore confessed as error, is presented at the threshold and must be disposed of first.\n\n\n2\nAfter the jury had returned its verdict, the petitioner learned for the first time that during the trial a person unnamed had communicated with a certain juror, who afterwards became the jury foreman, and remarked to him that he could profit by bringing in a verdict favorable to the petitioner. The juror reported the incident to the judge, who informed the prosecuting attorneys and advised with them. As a result, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was requested to make an investigation and report, which was accordingly done. The F.B.I. report was considered by the judge and prosecutors alone, and they apparently concluded that the statement to the juror was made in jest, and nothing further was done or said about the matter. Neither the judge nor the prosecutors informed the petitioner of the incident, and he and his counsel first learned of the matter by reading of it in the newspapers after the verdict.\n\n\n3\nThe above-stated facts were alleged in a motion for a new trial, together with an allegation that the petitioner was substantially prejudiced, thereby depriving him of a fair trial, and a request for a hearing to determine the circumstances surrounding the incident and its effect on the jury.* A supporting affidavit of the petitioner's attorneys recited the alleged occurrences and stated that if they had known of the incident they would have moved for a mistrial and requested that the juror in question be replaced by an alternate juror. Two newspaper articles reporting the incident were attached to the affidavit. The Government did not file answering affidavits. The District Court, without holding the requested hearing, denied the motion for a new trial. The Court of Appeals held that the District Court had not abused its discretion, since the petitioner had shown no prejudice to him. 9 Cir., 205 F.2d 277, 291. The case is here on writ of certiorari. 346 U.S. 884, 74 S.Ct. 144.\n\n\n4\nIn a criminal case, any private communication, contact, or tampering directly or indirectly, with a juror during a trial about the matter pending before the jury is, for obvious reasons, deemed presumptively prejudicial, if not made in pursuance of known rules of the court and the instructions and directions of the court made during the trial, with full knowledge of the parties. The presumption is not conclusive, but the burden rests heavily upon the Government to establish, after notice to and hearing of the defendant, that such contact with the juror was harmless to the defendant. Mattox v. United States, 146 U.S. 140, 148\u2014150, 13 S.Ct. 50, 52\u201453, 36 L.Ed. 917; Wheaton v. United States, 8 Cir., 133 F.2d 522, 527.\n\n\n5\nWe do not know from this record, nor does the petitioner know, what actually transpired, or whether the incidents that may have occurred were harmful or harmless. The sending of an F.B.I. agent in the midst of a trial to investigate a juror as to his conduct is bound to impress the juror and is very apt to do so unduly. A juror must feel free to exercise his functions without the F.B.I. or anyone else looking over his shoulder. The integrity of jury proceedings must not be jeopardized by unauthorized invasions. The trial court should not decide and take final action ex parte on information such as was received in this case, but should determine the circumstances, the impact thereof upon the juror, and whether or not it was prejudicial, in a hearing with all interested parties permitted to participate.\n\n\n6\nWe therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the District Court with directions to hold a hearing to determine whether the incident complained of was harmful to the petitioner, and if after hearing it is found to have been harmful, to grant a new trial.\n\n\n7\nJudgment vacated.\n\n\n8\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n\n*\n The motion for a new trial was also grounded on many other contentions, several of which have also been presented to this Court. Because of our disposition of the case on the issue treated herein, we do not pass upon these additional questions.\n\n\n","label":0}

In this case, on January 6, 1970, before Winship was decided, petitioner was adjudged a delinquent in the Family Court of Bronx County, New York, on a finding, based on the preponderance-of-evidence standard, that, at knifepoint, he forcibly took a bicycle from another boy, an act that, if done by an adult, would constitute the crime of robbery in the first degree. On direct appeal, the Appellate Division, First Department, reversed on the ground that Winship should be retroactively applied to all cases still in the appellate process, 35 A.D.2d 806, 316 N.Y.S.2d 568 (1970). The New York Court of Appeals reversed the Appellate Division, holding that Winship was not to be applied retroactively, V. v. City of New York, 29 N.Y.2d 583, 324 N.Y.S.2d 313, 272 N.E.2d 895 (1971).* On remand, the Appellate Division thereupon affirmed the delinquency adjudication, 37 A.D.2d 822, 324 N.Y.S.2d 934 (1971), and the Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal from that affirmance, 29 N.Y.2d 489, 328 N.Y.S.2d 1026, 278 N.E.2d 655 (1972). We disagree with the holding of the Court of Appeals that Winship is not to be applied retroactively.\n\n\n2\n'Where the major purpose of new constitutional doctrine is to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impairs its truth-finding function and so raises serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials, the new rule has been given complete retroactive effect. Neither good-faith reliance by state or federal authorities on prior constitutional law or accepted practice, nor severe impact on the administration of justice has sufficed to require prospective application in these circumstances.' Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, 653, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 1152, 28 L.Ed.2d 388 (1971). See Adams v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 278, 280, 92 S.Ct. 916, 918, 31 L.Ed.2d 202 (1972); Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 295, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 1922, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1968).\n\n\n3\nWinship expressly held that the reasonable-doubt standard 'is a prime instrument for reducing the risk of convictions resting on factual error. The standard provides concrete substance for the presumption of innocence\u2014that bedrock 'axiomatic and elementary' principle whose 'enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law' . . . 'Due process commands that no man shall lose his liberty unless the Government has borne the burden of . . . convincing the factfinder of his guilt.' To this end, the reasonable-doubt standard is indispensable, for it 'impresses on the trier of fact the necessity of reaching a subjective state of certitude of the facts in issue.\" 397 U.S., at 363\u2014364, 90 S.Ct., at 1072.\n\n\n4\nPlainly, then, the major purpose of the constitutional standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt announced in Winship was to overcome an aspect of a criminal trial that substantially impairs the truth-finding function, and Winship is thus to be given complete retroactive effect. The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for writ of certiorari are granted. The judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York, First Judicial Department, is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n5\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n6\nJudgment of the Appellate Division reversed and case remanded.\n\n\n7\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n\n*\n The Court of Appeals followed Matter of D., 27 N.Y.2d 90, 313 N.Y.S.2d 704, 261 N.E.2d 627 (1970), where Winship was said not to be retroactive but that even if it were, appellant there had waived the claim when he entered a guilty plea to the charges. In that circumstance this Court dismissed an appeal and denied certiorari in that case. D. v. County of Onandaga, 403 U.S. 926, 91 S.Ct. 2244, 29 L.Ed.2d 705 (1971).\n\n\n","label":0}

POWER et al.\nNo. 673.\nArgued April 18, 1966.\nDecided June 13, 1966.\n\nPaul O'Dwyer, New York City, for appellant.\nSamuel A. Hirshowitz, New York City, for appellees.\nMr. Justice BRENNAN, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis case was argued with Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 86 S.Ct. 1731, 16 L.Ed.2d 828, also decided today. We there sustained the constitutionality of \u00a7 4(e) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and held that, by force of the Supremacy Clause and as provided in \u00a7 4(e), the State of New York's English literacy requirement cannot be enforced against persons who had successfully completed a sixth grade education in a public school in, or a private school accredited by, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in which the language of instruction was other than English. In this case, which was adjudicated by the New York courts before the enactment of \u00a7 4(e), appellant unsuccessfully sought a judicial determination that the New York English literacy requirement, as applied to deny her the right to vote in all elections, violated the Federal Constitution.\n\n\n2\nAppellant was born and educated in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and has lived in New York City since about 1948. On July 23, 1963, she attempted to register to vote, presenting evidence of United States citizenship, her age and residence; and she represented that although she was able to read and write Spanish, she could not satisfy New York's English literacy requirement. The New York City Board of Elections refused to register her as a voter solely on the ground that she was not literate in English. Appellant then brought this proceeding in state court against the Board of Elections and its members. She alleged that the New York English literacy requirement as applied was invalid under the Federal Constitution and sought an order directing the Board to register her as a duly qualified voter, or, in the alternative, directing the Board to administer a literacy test in the Spanish language, and, if she passed the test, to register her as a duly qualified voter. The trial court denied the relief prayed for and the New York Court of Appeals, three judges dissenting, affirmed. 16 N.Y.2d 639, 261 N.Y.S.2d 78, 209 N.E.2d 119, remittitur amended, 16 N.Y.2d 708, 827, 261 N.Y.S.2d 900, 209 N.E.2d 556, 210 N.E.2d 458. We noted probable jurisdiction. 382 U.S. 1008, 86 S.Ct. 614, 15 L.Ed.2d 524.\n\n\n3\nAlthough appellant's complaint alleges that she attended a school in Puerto Rico, it is not alleged therein nor have we been clearly informed in any other way whether, as required by \u00a7 4(e), she successfully completed the sixth grade of a public school in, or a private school accredited by, the Commonwealth.* If she had completed the sixth grade in such a school, her failure to satisfy the New York English literacy requirement would no longer be a bar to her registration in light of our decision today in Katzenbach v. Morgan. This case might therefore be moot; appellant would not need any relief if \u00a7 4(e) in terms accomplished the result she sought. Cf., e.g., Dinsmore v. Southern Express Co., 183 U.S. 115, 119\u2014120, 22 S.Ct. 45, 46, 46 L.Ed. 111. Moreover, even if appellant were not specifically covered by \u00a7 4(e), the New York courts should in the first instance determine whether, in light of this federal enactment, those applications of the New York English literacy requirement not in terms prohibited by \u00a7 4(e) have continuing validity. We therefore vacate the judgment, without costs to either party in this Court, and remand the cause to the Court of Appeals of New York for such further proceedings as it may deem appropriate.\n\n\n4\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n5\nJudgment vacated and cause remanded.\n\n\n6\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice FORTAS concurs, dissenting.\n\n\n7\nAppellant is an American of Spanish ancestry, literate in the Spanish language but illiterate in English and hence barred from voting by New York's statute.\n\n\n8\nI doubt that literacy is a wise prerequisite for exercise of the franchise. Literacy and intelligence are not synonymous. The experience of nations1 like India, where illiterate persons have returned to office responsible governments over and again, emphasizes that the ability to read and write is not necessary for an intelligent use of the ballot. Yet our problem as judges is not to determine what is wise or unwise. The issues of constitutional power are more confined. A State has broad powers over elections; and I cannot say that it is an unconstitutional exercise of that power to condition the use of the ballot on the ability to read and write. That is the only teaching of Lassiter v. Northampton Election Board, 360 U.S. 45, 79 S.Ct. 985, 3 L.Ed.2d 1072. But we are a multi-racial and multi-linguistic nation; and there are groups in this country as versatile in Spanish, French, Japanese, and Chinese, for example, as others are in English. Many of them constitute communities in which there are widespread organs of public communication in one of those tongues\u2014such as newspapers, magazines, radio, and television which regularly report and comment on matters of political interest and public concern. Such is the case in New York City where Spanish-language newspapers and periodicals flourish and where there are Spanish-language radio broadcasts which appellant reads and listens to. Before taking up residence in New York City she lived in Puerto Rico where she regularly voted in gubernatorial, legislative, and municipal elections. And so our equal protection question is whether intelligent use of the ballot should not be as much presumed where one is versatile in the Spanish language as it is where English is the medium.\n\n\n9\nNew York's law permits an English-speaking voter to qualify either by passing an English literacy test2 or by presenting a certificate showing completion of the sixth grade of an approved elementary school in which English is the language of instruction.3 But a Spanish-speaking person, such as appellant, is offered no literacy test in Spanish. Her only recourse is to a certificate showing completion of the sixth grade of a public school in, or a private school accredited by, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico;4 and prior to \u00a7 4(e) of the Voting Rights Act that school had to be one in which English was the language of instruction. The heavier burden which New York has placed on the Spanish-speaking American cannot in my view be sustained, under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n10\nWe deal here with the right to vote which over and again we have called a 'fundamental matter in a free and democratic society.' Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 561\u2014562, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 12 L.Ed.2d 506; Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 667, 86 S.Ct. 1079, 1083, 16 L.Ed.2d 169. Where classifications might 'invade or restrain' fundamental rights and liberties, they must be 'closely scrutinized and carefully confined.' Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections, supra, at 670, 86 S.Ct. at 1083. Our philosophy that removal of unwise laws must be left to the ballot, not to the courts, requires that recourse to the ballot not be restricted as New York has attempted. It little profits the Spanish-speaking people of New York that this literacy test can be changed by legislation either in Albany or in Washington, D.C., if they are barred from participating in the process of selecting those legislatures. This is a fundamental reason why a far sterner test is required when a law\u2014whether state or federal\u2014abridges a fundamental right.5\n\n\n11\nNew York, as I have said, registers those who have completed six years of school in a classroom where English is the medium of instruction and those who pass an English literacy test. In my view, there is no rational basis\u2014considering the importance of the right at stake\u2014for denying those with equivalent qualifications except that the language is Spanish. Thus appellant has, quite apart from any federal legislation, a constitutional right to vote in New York on a parity with an English-speaking citizen\u2014either by passing a Spanish literacy test or through a certificate showing completion of the sixth grade in a Puerto Rican school where Spanish was the classroom language. In no other way can she be placed on a constitutional parity with English-speaking electors.\n\n\n\n*\n Presumably the predominant classroom language of the school she attended was other than English, and thus that element of \u00a7 4(e) is satisfied. If the predominant classroom language had been English, and if she had successfully completed the sixth grade, then she would be entitled to vote under \u00a7 168 of the New York Election Law, McKinney's Consol.Laws, c. 17. See n. 2, in Katzenbach v. Morgan, ante.\n\n\n1\n Puerto Rico in the last quarter century has also provided a demonstration of the point, although it is fast overcoming its illiteracy problem. In 1940 31.5% of its people were illiterate. The rate was reduced to 13.8% in 1965.

He admitted involvement in the crime but later claimed that the adminission was made under duress and was false. The probation of respondent, who was not represented by an attorney, was revoked without a hearing. After filing a habeas corpus petition, he was paroled. The District Court concluded that revocation of probation without hearing and counsel was a denial of due process. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:\n1. Due process mandates preliminary and final revocation hearings in the case of a probationer under the same conditions as are specified in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484, in the case of a parolee. Pp. 781\u2014782.\n2. The body conducting the hearings should decide in each individual case whether due process requires that an indigent probationer or parolee be represented by counsel. Though the State is not constitutionally obliged to provide counsel in all cases, it should do so where the indigent probationer or parolee may have difficulty in presenting his version of disputed facts without the examination or cross-examination of witnesses or the presentation of complicated documentary evidence. Presumptively, counsel should be provided where, after being informed of his right, the probationer or parolee requests counsel, based on a timely and colorable claim that he has not committed the alleged violation or, if the violation is a matter of public record or uncontested, there are substantial reasons in justification or mitigation that make revocation inappropriate.

Coffey, Milwaukee, Wis., for respondent.\nMr. Justice POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nThis case presents the related questions whether a previously sentenced probationer is entitled to a hearing when his probation is revoked and, if so, whether he is entitled to be represented by appointed counsel at such a hearing.\n\n\n2\n* Respondent, Gerald Scarpelli, pleaded guilty in July 1965, to a charge of armed robbery in Wisconsin. The trial judge sentenced him to 15 years' imprisonment, but suspended the sentence and placed him on probation for seven years in the custody of the Wisconsin Department of Public Welfare (the Department).1 At that time, he signed an agreement specifying the terms of his probation and a 'Travel Permit and Agreement to Return' allowing him to reside in Illinois, with supervision there under an interstate compact. On August 5, 1965, he was accepted for supervision by the Adult Probation Department of Cook County, Illinois.\n\n\n3\nOn August 6, respondent was apprehended by Illinois police, who had surprised him and one Fred Kleckner, Jr., in the course of the burglary of a house. After being apprised of his constitutional rights, respondent admitted that he and Kleckner had broken into the house for the purpose of stealing merchandise or money, although he now asserts that his statement was made under duress and is false. Probation was revoked by the Wisconsin Department on September 1, without a hearing. The stated grounds for revocation were that:\n\n\n4\n'1. (Scarpelli) has associated with known criminals, in      direct violation of his probation regulations and his      supervising agent's instructions;\n\n\n5\n'2. (Scarpelli) while associating with a known criminal,      namely Fred Kleckner, Jr., was involved in, and arrested for,      a burglary . . . in Deerfield, Illinois.' App. 20.\n\n\n6\nOn September 4, 1965, he was incarcerated in the Wisconsin State Reformatory at Green Bay to begin serving the 15 years to which he had been sentenced by the trial judge. At no time was he afforded a hearing.\n\n\n7\nSome three years later, on December 16, 1968, respondent applied for a writ of habeas corpus. After the petition had been filed, but before it had been acted upon, the Department placed respondent on parole.2 The District Court found that his status as parolee was sufficient custody to confer jurisdiction on the court and that the petition was not moot because the revocation carried 'collateral consequences,' presumably including the restraints imposed by his parole. On the merits, the District Court held that revocation without a hearing and counsel was a denial of due process. 317 F.Supp. 72 (ED Wis.1970). The Court of Appeals affirmed sub nom. Gunsolus v. Gagnon, 454 F.2d 416 (CA7 1971), and we granted certiorari. 408 U.S. 921, 92 S.Ct. 2490, 33 L.Ed.2d 331 (1972).\n\nII\n\n8\nTwo prior decisions set the bounds of our present inquiry. In Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U.S. 128, 88 S.Ct. 254, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967), the Court held that a probationer is entitled to be represented by appointed counsel at a combined revocation and sentencing hearing. Reasoning that counsel is required 'at every stage of a criminal proceeding where substantial rights of a criminal accused may be affected,' Id., at 134, 88 S.Ct., at 257, and that sentencing is one such stage, the Court concluded that counsel must be provided an indigent at sentencing even when it is accomplished as part of a subsequent probation revocation proceeding. But this line of reasoning does not require a hearing or counsel at the time of probation revocation in a case such as the present one, where the probationer was sentenced at the time of trial.\n\n\n9\nOf greater relevance is our decision last Term in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). There we held that the revocation of parole is not a part of a criminal prosecution.\n\n\n10\n'Parole arises after the end of the criminal prosecution,      including imposition of sentence. . . . Revocation deprives      an individual, not of the absolute liberty to which every      citizen is entitled, but only of the conditional liberty      properly dependent on observance of special parole      restrictions.' Id., at 480, 92 S.Ct. at 2600.\n\n\n11\nEven though the revocation of parole is not a part of the criminal prosecution, we held that the loss of liberty entailed is a serious deprivation requiring that the parolee be accorded due process. Specifically, we held that a parolee is entitled to two hearings, one a preliminary hearing at the time of his arrest and detention to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that he has committed a violation of his parole, and the other a somewhat more comprehensive hearing prior to the making of the final revocation decision.\n\n\n12\nPetitioner does not contend that there is any difference relevant to the guarantee of due process between the revocation of parole and the revocation of probation, nor do we perceive one.3 Probation revocation, like parole revocation, is not a stage of a criminal prosecution, but does result in a loss of liberty.4 Accordingly, we hold that a probationer, like a parolee, is entitled to a preliminary and a final revocation hearing, under the conditions specified in Morrissey v. Brewer, supra.5\n\nIII\n\n13\nThe second, and more difficult, question posed by this case is whether an indigent probationer or parolee has a due process right to be represented by appointed counsel at these hearings.6 In answering that question, we draw heavily on the opinion in Morrissey. Our first point of reference is the character of probation or parole. As noted in Morrissey regarding parole, the 'purpose is to help individuals reintegrate into society as constructive individuals as soon as they are able. . . .' 408 U.S., at 477, 92 S.Ct. at 2598. The duty and attitude of the probation or parole officer reflect this purpose:\n\n\n14\n'While the parole or probation officer recognizes his double      duty to the welfare of his clients and to the safety of the      general community, by and large concern for the client      dominates his professional attitude. The parole agent ordinarily defines his role as      representing his client's best interests as long as these do      not constitute a threat to public safety.'7\n\n\n15\nBecause the probation or parole officer's function is not so much to compel conformance to a strict code of behavior as to supervise a course of rehabilitation, he has been entrusted traditionally with broad discretion to judge the progress of rehabilitation in individual cases, and has been armed with the power to recommend or even to declare revocation.\n\n\n16\nIn Morrissey, we recognized that the revocation decision has two analytically distinct components:\n\n\n17\n'The first step in a revocation decision thus involves a      wholly retrospective factual question: whether the parolee      has in fact acted in violation of one or more conditions of      his parole. Only if it is determined that the parolee did      violate the conditions does the second question arise: should      the parolee be recommitted to prison or should other steps be      taken to protect society and improve chances of      rehabilitation?' 408 U.S., at 479\u2014480, 92 S.Ct., at 2599.8\n\n\n18\nThe parole officer's attitude toward these decisions reflects the rehabilitative rather than punitive focus of the probation\/parole system:\n\n\n19\n'Revocation . . . is, if anything, commonly treated as a      failure of supervision. While presumably it would be      inappropriate for a field agent never to revoke, the whole      thrust of the probation-parole movement is to keep men in the      community, working with adjustment problems there, and using      revocation only as a last resort when treatment has failed or      is about to fail.'9\n\n\n20\nBut an exclusive focus on the benevolent attitudes of those who administer the probation\/parole system when it is working successfully obscures the modification in attitude which is likely to take place once the officer has decided to recommend revocation. Even though the officer is not by this recommendation converted into a prosecutor committed to convict, his role as counsellor to the probationer or parolee is then surely compromised.\n\n\n21\nWhen the officer's view of the probationer's or parolee's conduct differs in this fundamental way from the latter's own view, due process requires that the difference be resolved before revocation becomes final. Both the probationer or parolee and the State have interests in the accurate finding of fact and the informed use of discretion\u2014the probationer or parolee to insure that his liberty is not unjustifiably taken away and the State to make certain that it is neither unnecessarily interrupting a successful effort at rehabilitation nor imprudently prejudicing the safety of the community.\n\n\n22\nIt was to serve all of these interests that Morrissey mandated preliminary and final revocation hearings. At the preliminary hearing, a probationer or parolee is entitled to notice of the alleged violations of probation or parole, an opportunity to appear and to present evidence in his own behalf, a conditional right to confront adverse witnesses, an independent decisionmaker, and a written report of the hearing. 408 U.S., at 487, 92 S.Ct., at 2603. The final hearing is a less summary one because the decision under consideration is the ultimate decision to revoke rather than a mere determination of probable cause, but the 'minimum requirements of due process' include very similar elements:\n\n\n23\n'(a) written notice of the claimed violations of (probation      or) parole; (b) disclosure to the (probationer or) parolee of      evidence against him; (c) opportunity to be heard in person      and to present witnesses and documentary evidence; (d) the      right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless      the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not      allowing confrontation); (e) a 'neutral and detached' hearing      body such as a traditional parole board, members of which      need not be judicial officers or lawyears; and (f) a written      statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on and      reasons for revoking (probation or) parole.' Morrissey v.      Brewer, supra, at 489, 92 S.Ct. at 2604.\n\n\n24\nThese requirements in themselves serve as substantial protection against ill-considered revocation, and petitioner argues that counsel need never be supplied. What this argument overlooks is that the effectiveness of the rights guaranteed by Morrissey may in some circumstances depend on the use of skills which the probationer or parolee is unlikely to possess. Despite the informal nature of the proceedings and the absence of technical rules of procedure or evidence, the unskilled or uneducated probationer or parolee may well have difficulty in presenting his version of a disputed set of facts where the presentation requires the examining or cross-examining of witnesses or the offering or dissecting of complex documentary evidence.\n\n\n25\nBy the same token, we think that the Court of Appeals erred in accepting respondent's contention that the State is under a constitutional duty to provide counsel for indigents in all probation or parole revocation cases. While such a rule has the appeal of simplicity, it would impose direct costs and serious collateral disadvantages without regard to the need or the likelihood in a particular case for a constructive contribution by counsel. In most cases, the probationer or parolee has been convicted of committing another crime or has admitted the charges against him.10 And while in some cases he may have a justifiable excuse for the violation or a convincing reason why revocation is not the appropriate disposition, mitigating evidence of this kind is often not susceptible of proof or is so simple as not to require either investigation or exposition by counsel.\n\n\n26\nThe introduction of counsel into a revocation proceeding will alter significantly the nature of the proceeding. If counsel is provided for the probationer or parolee, the State in turn will normally provide its own counsel; lawyers, by training and disposition, are advocates and bound by professional duty to present all available evidence and arguments in support of their clients' positions and to contest with vigor all adverse evidence and views. The role of the hearing body itself, aptly described in Morrissey as being 'predictive and discretionary' as well as factfinding, may become more akin to that of a judge at a trial, and less attuned to the rehabilitative needs of the individual probationer or parolee. In the greater self-consciousness of its quasi-judicial role, the hearing body may be less tolerant of marginal deviant behavior and feel more pressure to reincarcerate than to continue nonpunitive rehabilitation. Certainly, the decisionmaking process will be prolonged, and the financial cost to the State\u2014for appointed counsel, counsel for the State, a longer record, and the possibility of judicial review\u2014will not be insubstantial.11\n\n\n27\nIn some cases, these modifications in the nature of the revocation hearing must be endured and the costs borne because, as we have indicated above, the probationer's or parolee's version of a disputed issue can fairly be represented only by a trained advocate. But due process is not so rigid as to require that the significant interests in informality, flexibility, and economy must always be sacrificed.\n\n\n28\nIn so concluding, we are of course aware that the case-by-case approach to the right to counsel in felony prosecutions adopted in Betts v. Brady, 316 U.S. 455, 62 S.Ct. 1252, 86 L.Ed. 1595 (1942), was later rejected in favor of a per se rule in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963). See also Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25, 92 S.Ct. 2006, 32 L.Ed.2d 530 (1972). We do not, however, draw from Gideon and Argersinger the conclusion that a case-by-case approach to furnishing counsel is necessarily inadequate to protect constitutional rights asserted in varying types of proceedings: there are critical differences between criminal trials and probation or parole revocation hearings, and both society and the probationer or parolee have stakes in preserving these differences.\n\n\n29\nIn a criminal trial, the State is represented by a prosecutor; formal rules of evidence are in force; a defendant enjoys a number of procedural rights which may be lost if not timely raised; and, in a jury trial, a defendant must make a presentation understandable to untrained jurors. In Short, a criminal trial under our system is an adversary proceeding with its own unique characteristics. In a revocation hearing, on the other hand, the State is represented, not by a prosecutor, but by a parole officer with the orientation described above; formal procedures and rules of evidence are not employed; and the members of the hearing body are familiar with the problems and practice of probation or parole. The need for counsel at revocation hearings derives, not from the invariable attributes of those hearings, but rather from the peculiarities of particular cases.\n\n\n30\nThe differences between a criminal trial and a revocation hearing do not dispose altogether of the argument that under a case-by-case approach there may be cases in which a lawyer would be useful but in which none would be appointed because an arguable defense would be uncovered only by a lawyer. Without denying that there is some force in this argument, we think it a sufficient answer that we deal here, not with the right of an accused to counsel in a criminal prosecution, but with the more limited due process right of one who is a probationer or parolee only because he has been convicted of a crime.12\n\n\n31\nWe thus find no justification for a new inflexible constitutional rule with respect to the requirement of counsel. We think, rather, that the decision as to the need for counsel must be made on a case-by-case basis in the exercise of a sound discretion by the state authority charged with responsibility for administering the probation and parole system. Although the presence and participation of counsel will probably be both undesirable and constitutionally unnecessary in most revocation hearings, there will remain certain cases in which fundamental fairness\u2014the touchstone of due process\u2014will require that the State provide at its expense counsel for indigent probationers or parolees.\n\n\n32\nIt is neither possible nor prudent to attempt to formulate a precise and detailed set of guidelines to be followed in determining when the providing of counsel is necessary to meet the applicable due process requirements. The facts and circumstances in preliminary and final hearings are susceptible of almost infinite variation, and a considerable discretion must be allowed the responsible agency in making the decision. Presumptively, it may be said that counsel should be provided in cases where, after being informed of his right to request counsel, the probationer or parolee makes such a request, based on a timely and colorable claim (i) that he has not committed the alleged violation of the conditions upon which he is at liberty; or (ii) that, even if the violation is a matter of public record or is uncontested, there are substantial reasons which justified or mitigated the violation and make revocation inappropriate, and that the reasons are complex or otherwise difficult to develop or present. In passing on a request for the appointment of counsel, the responsible agency also should consider, especially in doubtful cases, whether the probationer appears to be capable of speaking effectively for himself. In every case in which a request for counsel at a preliminary or final hearing is refused, the grounds for refusal should be stated succinctly in the record.\n\nIV\n\n33\nWe return to the facts of the present case. Because respondent was not afforded either a preliminary hearing or a final hearing the revocation of his probation did not meet the standards of due process prescribed in Morrissey, which we have here held applicable to probation revocations. Accordingly, respondent was entitled to a writ of habeas corpus. On remand, the District Court should allow the State an opportunity to conduct such a hearing. As to whether the State must provide counsel, respondent's admission to having committed another serious crime creates the very sort of situation in which counsel need not ordinarily be provided. But because of respondent's subsequent assertions regarding that admission, see supra, at 780, we conclude that the failure of the Department to provide respondent with the assistance of counsel should be re-examined in light of this opinion. The general guidelines outlined above should be applied in the first instance by those charged with conducting the revocation hearing.\n\n\n34\nAffirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n\n\n35\nMr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting in part.\n\n\n36\nI believe that due process requires the appointment of counsel in this case because of the claim that respondent's confession of the burglary was made under duress. See Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 498, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2608, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (opinion of Douglas, J.).\n\n\n\n1\n The Court's order placing respondent on probation provided, among other things, that '(i)n the event of his failure to meet the conditions of his probation he will stand committed under the sentence all ready (sic) imposed.' App. 10. The agreement specifying the conditions of the probation, duly executed by respondent, obligated him to 'make a sincere attempt to avoid all acts which are forbidden by law . . ..' App. 12.\n\n\n2\n Respondent was initially paroled to a federal detainer to serve a previously imposed federal sentence arising from another conviction. He was subsequently released from federal custody, but remains a parolee under the supervision of the Department.\n\n\n3\n Despite the undoubted minor differences between probation and parole, the commentators have agreed that revocation of probation where sentence has been imposed previously is constitutionally indistinguishable from the revocation of parole. See, e.g., Van Dyke, Parole Revocation Hearings in California: The Right to Counsel, 59 Calif.L.Rev. 1215, 1241\u20141243 (1971); Sklar, Law and Practice in Probation and Parole Revocation Hearings, 55 J.Crim.L.C. & P.S. 175, 198 n. 182 (1964).\n\n\n4\n It is clear at least after Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972), that a probationer can no longer be denied due process, in reliance on the dictum in Escoe v. Zerbst, 295 U.S. 490, 492, 55 S.Ct. 818, 819, 79 L.Ed. 1566 (1935), that probation is an 'act of grace.'\n\n\n5\n Petitioner argues, in addition, that the Morrissey hearing requirements impose serious practical problems in cases such as the present one in which a probationer or parolee is allowed to leave the convicting State for supervision in another State. Such arrangements are made pursuant to an interstate compact adopted by all of the States, including Wisconsin. Wis.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 57.13 (1957). Petitioner's brief asserts that as of June 30, 1972, Wisconsin had a total of 642 parrolees and probationers under supervision in other States and that incomplete statistics as of June 30, 1971, indicated a national total of 24,693 persons under out-of-state supervision. Brief for Petitioner 21\u201422.\n'Some amount of disruption inevitably attends any new constitutional ruling. We are confident, however, that modification of the interstate compact can remove without undue strain the more serious technical hurdles to compliance with Morrissey. An additional comment is warranted with respect to the rights to present witnesses and to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses. Petitioner's greatest concern is with the difficulty and expense of procuring witnesses from perhaps thousands of miles away. While in some cases there is simply no adequate alternative to live testimony, we emphasize that we did not in Morrissey intend to prohibit use where appropriate of the conventional substitutes for live testimony, including affidavits, depositions, and documentary evidence. Nor did we intend to foreclose the States from holding both the preliminary and the final hearings at the place of violation or from developing other creative solutions to the practical difficulties of the Morrissey requirements.\n\n\n6\n In Morrissey v. Brewer, we left open the question 'whether the parolee is entitled to the assistance of retained counsel or to appointed counsel if he is indigent.' 408 U.S., at 489, 92 S.Ct. at 2604. Since respondent did not attempt to retain counsel but asked only for appointed counsel, we have no occasion to decide in this case whether a probationer or parolee has a right to be represented at a revocation hearing by retained counsel in situations other than those where the State would be obliged to furnish counsel for an indigent.\n\n\n7\n F. Remington, D. Newman, E. Kimball, M. Melli & H. Goldstein, Criminal Justice Administration, Materials and Cases 910\u2014911 (1969).\n\n\n8\n The factors entering into these decisions relate in major part to a professional evaluation, by trained probation or parole officers, as to the overall social readjustment of the offender in the community, and include consideration of such variables as the offender's relationship toward his family, his attitude toward the fulfillment of financial obligations, the extent of his cooperation with the probation or parole officer assigned to his case, his personal associations, and\u2014of course\u2014whether there have been specific and significant violations of the conditions of the probation or parole. The importance of these considerations, some factual and others entirely judgmental, is illustrated by a Wisconsin empirical study which disclosed that, in the sample studied, probation or parole was revoked in only 34.5% of the cases in which the probationer or parolee violated the terms of his release. S. Hunt, The Revocation Decision: A Study of Probation and Parole Agents' Discretion 10 (unpublished thesis on file at the library of the University of Wisconsin) (1964), cited in Brief for Petitioner, Addendum 106.\n\n\n9\n Remington, Newman, Kimball, Melli & Goldstein, supra, n. 7, at 910.\n\n\n10\n See Sklar, supra, n. 3, at 192 (parole), 193 (probation).\n\n\n11\n The scope of the practical problem which would be occasioned by a requirement of counsel in all revocation cases is suggested by the fact that in the mid-1960's there was an estimated average of 20,000 adult felony parole revocations and 108,000 adult probation revocations each year. President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, Task Force Report: The Courts 56 n. 28 (1967).\n\n\n12\n Cf. In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967), establishing a juvenile's right to appointed counsel in a delinquency proceeding which, while denominated civil, was functionally akin to a criminal trial. A juvenile charged with violation of a generally applicable statute is differently situated from an already-convicted probationer or parolee, and is entitled to a higher degree of protection. See In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970) (the standard of proof in a juvenile delinquency proceeding must be 'proof beyond a reasonable doubt').\n\n\n","label":0}

{"text":"414 U.S. 661\n94 S.Ct. 772\n39 L.Ed.2d 73\nThe ONEIDA INDIAN NATION OF NEW YORK STATE et  al., Petitioners,v.The COUNTY OF ONEIDA, NEW YORK, et al.\nNo. 72-851.\nArgued Nov. 6 and 7, 1973.\nDecided Jan. 21, 1974.\n\nSyllabus\nPetitioners brought this action for the fair rental value for a specified period of certain land in New York that the Oneidas had ceded to the State in 1795, alleging, inter alia, that the Oneidas had owned and occupied the land from time immemorial to the time of the American Revolution; that in the 1780's and 1790's various treaties with the United States had confirmed their right to possession of the land until purchased by the United States; that in 1790 the treaties had been implemented by the Nonintercourse Act forbidding the conveyance of Indian lands without the United States' consent; and that the 1795 cession was without such consent and hence ineffective to terminate the Oneidas' right to possession under the treaties and applicable federal statutes. The District Court, ruling that the action arose under state law, dismissed the complaint for failure to raise a question arising under the laws of the United States within the meaning of either 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362. The Court of Appeals, relying on the 'wellpleaded complaint rule' of Taylor v. Anderson, 234 U.S. 74, 34 S.Ct. 724, 58 L.Ed. 1218, affirmed and held that although the decision would ultimately depend on whether the 1795 cession complied with the Nonintercourse Act, and what the consequences would be if it did not, this alone did not establish 'arising under' jurisdiction because the federal issue was not one of the necessary elements of the complaint, which essentially sought relief based on the right to possession of real property. Held: The complaint states a controversy arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the District Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1362. Pp. 666\u2014682.\n(a) Petitioners asserted a current right to possession conferred by federal law, wholly independent of state law, the threshold allegation required of such a well-pleaded complaint\u2014the right to possession\u2014being plainly enough alleged to be based on federal law so that the federal law issue did not arise solely in anticipation of a defense. Pp. 666, 677.\n(b) Petitioners' claim of a federal right to possession governed wholly by federal law is not so insubstantial or devoid of merit as to preclude a federal controversy within the District Court's jurisdiction, regardless of how the federal issue is ultimately resolved. Pp. 666\u2014667.\n(c) Indian title is a matter of federal law and can be extinguished only with federal consent. Pp. 670\u2014674.\n(d) This is not a case where the underlying right or obligation arises only under state law and federal law is merely alleged as a barrier to its effectuation. Gully v. First National Bank, 299 U.S. 109, 57 S.Ct. 96, 81 L.Ed. 70, distinguished. Pp. 675\u2014676.\n(e) In sustaining the District Court's jurisdiction, the well-pleaded complaint rule of Taylor v. Anderson, supra, is not disturbed, since here the right to possession itself is claimed to arise under federal law in the first instance, and allegedly aboriginal title of an Indian tribe guaranteed by treaty and protected by statute has never been extinguished. P. 676.\n(f) The complaint satisfies the requirement that it reveal a dispute or controversy respecting the validity, construction, or effect of a federal law, upon the determination of which the result depends. Pp. 677\u2014678.\n(g) The conclusion that this case arises under the laws of the United States comports with the language and legislative history of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 233 granting to New York civil jurisdiction over disputes between Indians or between Indians and others.

Burke for respondent.\nJeremiah Jochnowitz, Albany, N.Y. for the State of New York, as amicus curiae, by special leave of Court.\nMr. Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nBoth \u00a7 1331 and \u00a7 1362 of Title 28 of the United States Code confer jurisdiction on the district courts to hear cases 'aris(ing) under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.'1 Section 1331 requires that the amount in controversy exceed $10,000. Under \u00a7 1362, Indian tribes may bring such suits without regard to the amount in controversy. The question now before us is whether the District Court had jurisdiction over this case under either of these sections.\n\n\n2\n* The complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York by the Oneida Indian Nation of New York State and the Oneida Indian Nation of Wisconsin against the Counties of Oneida and Madison in the State of New York.2 The complaint alleged that from time immemorial down to the time of the American Revolution the Oneidas had owned and occupied some six million acres of land in the State of New York. The complaint also alleged that in the 1780's and 1790's various treaties had been entered into between the Oneidas and the United States confirming the Indians' right to possession of their lands until purchased by the United States3 and that in 1790 the treaties had been implemented by federal statute the Nonintercourse Act, 1 Stat. 137, forbidding the conveyance of Indian lands without the consent of the United States. It was then alleged that in 1788 the Oneidas had ceded five million acres to the State of New York, 300,000 acres being withheld as a reservation, and that in 1795 a portion of these reserved lands was also ceded to the State. Assertedly, the 1795 cession was without the consent of the United States and hence ineffective to terminate the Indians' right to possession under the federal treaties and the applicable federal statutes. Also alleging that the 1795 cession was for an unconscionable and inadequate price and that portions of the premises were now in possession of and being used by the defendant counties, the complaint prayed for damages representing the fair rental value of the land for the period January 1, 1968, through December 31, 1969.\n\n\n3\nThe District Court ruled that the cause of action, regardless of the label given it, was created under state law and required only allegations of the plaintiffs' possessory rights and the defendants' interference therewith. The possible necessity of interpreting a federal statute or treaties to resolve a potential defense was deemed insufficient to sustain federal-question jurisdiction. The complaint was accordingly dismissed for want of subject matter jurisdiction for failure of the complaint to raise a question arising under the laws of the United States within the meaning of either \u00a7 1331 or \u00a7 1362.\n\n\n4\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed, with one judge dissenting, ruling that the jurisdictional claim 'shatters on the rock of the 'well-pleaded complaint' rule for determining federal question jurisdiction.' 464 F.2d 916, 918 (CA2 1972). Although '(d)ecision would ultimately turn on whether the deed of 1795 complied with what is now 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 177 and what the consequences would be if it did not,' id., at 919, this alone did not establish 'arising under' jurisdiction because the federal issue was not one of the necessary elements of the complaint, which was read as essentially seeking relief based on the right to possession of real property. The Court of Appeals thought Taylor v. Anderson, 234 U.S. 74, 34 S.Ct. 724, 58 L.Ed. 1218 (1914), directly in point. There, a complaint in ejectment did not state a claim arising under the laws of the United States even though it alleged that the defendants were claiming under a deed that was void under acts of Congress restraining the alienation of lands allotted to Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians. The Court applied the principle that whether a case arises under federal law for purposes of the jurisdictional statute 'must be determined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff's statement of his own claim in the bill or declaration, unaided by anything alleged in anticipation of avoidance of defenses which it is thought the defendant may interpose.' Id., at 75\u201476, 34 S.Ct. at 724. Because the only essential allegations were plaintiffs' rights to possession, defendants' wrongful holding and the damage claim, the complaint did not properly assert a federal issue, however likely it might be that it would be relevant to or determinative of a defense. In the present case, noting that the District Judge was correct in holding that under New York law these allegations would suffice to state a cause of action in ejectment, the Court of Appeals considered Taylor to be dispositive.\n\n\n5\nBoth the District Court and the Court of Appeals were in error, and we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\nII\n\n6\nAccepting the premise of the Court of Appeals that the case was essentially a possessory action, we are of the view that the complaint asserted a current right to possession conferred by federal law, wholly independent of state law. The threshold allegation required of such a well-pleaded complaint\u2014the right to possession\u2014was plainly enough alleged to be based on federal law. The federal law issue, therefore, did not arise solely in anticipation of a defense. Moreover, we think that the basis for petitioners' assertion that they had a federal right to possession governed wholly by federal law cannot be said to be so insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions of this Court, or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy within the jurisdiction of the District Court, whatever may be the ultimate resolution of the federal issues on the merits. See, e.g., The Fair v. Kohler Die & Specialty Co., 228 U.S. 22, 25, 33 S.Ct. 410, 411, 27 L.Ed. 716 (1913); Montana Catholic Missions v. Missoula County, 200 U.S. 118, 130, 26 S.Ct. 197, 201, 50 L.Ed. 398 (1906); Levering & Garrigues Co. v. Morrin, 289 U.S. 103, 105 106, 53 S.Ct. 549, 550, 77 L.Ed. 1062 (1933); Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Public Service Co., 341 U.S. 246, 249, 71 S.Ct. 692, 694, 95 L.Ed. 912 (1951). Given the nature and source of the possessory rights of Indian tribes to their aboriginal lands, particularly when confirmed by treaty, it is plain that the complaint asserted a controversy arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States within the meaning of both \u00a7 1331 and \u00a7 1362.\n\n\n7\nIt very early became accepted doctrine in this Court that although fee title to the lands occupied by Indians when the colonists arrived became vested in the sovereign\u2014first the discovering European nation and later the original States and the United States\u2014a right of occupancy in the Indian tribes was nevertheless recognized. That right, sometimes called Indian title and good against all but the sovereign, could be terminated only by sovereign act. Once the United States was organized and the Constitution adopted, these tribal rights to Indian lands became the exclusive province of the federal law. Indian title, recognized to be only a right of occupancy, was extinguishable only by the United States. The Federal Government took early steps to deal with the Indians through treaty, the principal purpose often being to recognize and guarantee the rights of Indians to specified areas of land. This the United States did with respect to the various New York Indian tribes, including the Oneidas. The United States also asserted the primacy of federal law in the first Nonintercourse Act passed in 1790, 1 Stat. 137, 138, which provided that 'no sale of lands made by any Indians . . . within the United States, shall be valid to any person . . . or to any state . . . unless the same shall be made and duly executed at some public treaty, held under the authority of the United States.'4 This has remained the policy of the United States to this day. See 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 177.\n\n\n8\nIn United States v. Santa Fe Pacific R. Co., 314 U.S. 339, 345, 62 S.Ct. 248, 251, 86 L.Ed. 1116 (1941), a unanimous Court succinctly summarized the essence of past cases in relevant respects:\n\n\n9\n\"Unquestionably it has been the policy of the federal      government from the beginning to respect the Indian right of      occupancy, which could only be interfered with or determined      by the United States.' Cramer v. United States, 261 U.S. 219,      227, 43 S.Ct. 342, (344,) 67 L.Ed. 622. This policy was first      recognized in Johnson v. M'Intosh, 8 Wheat. 543, 5 L.Ed. 681,      and has been repeatedly reaffirmed. Worcester v. Georgia, 6      Pet. 515, 8 L.Ed. 483; Mitchel v. United States, 9 Pet. 711,      9 L.Ed. 283; Chouteau v. Molony, 16 How. 203, 14 L.Ed. 905;      Holden v. Joy, 17 Wall. 211, 21 L.Ed. 523; Buttz v. Northern      Pacific Railroad (119 U.S. 55, 7 S.Ct. 100, 30 L.Ed. 330);      United States v. Shoshone Tribe, 304 U.S. 111, 58 S.Ct. 794,      82 L.Ed. 1213. As stated in Mitchel v. United States, supra,      9 Pet. 746, 9 L.Ed. 283, Indian 'right of occupancy is considered as sacred as the fee simple of the      whites.\"\n\n\n10\nThe Santa Fe case also reaffirmed prior decisions to the effect that a tribal right of occupancy, to be protected, need not be 'based upon a treaty, statute, or other formal government action.' Id., at 347, 62 S.Ct., at 252. Tribal rights were nevertheless entitled to the protection of federal law, and with respect to Indian title based on aboriginal possession, the 'power of Congress . . . is supreme.' Ibid.\n\n\n11\nAs indicated in Santa Fe, the fundamental propositions which it restated were firmly rooted in earlier cases. In Johnson v. M'Intosh, 8 Wheat. 543, 5 L.Ed. 681 (1823), the Court refused to recognize land titles originating in grants by Indians to private parties in 1773 and 1775; those grants were contrary to the accepted principle that Indian title could be extinguished only by or with the consent of the general government. The land in question, when ceded to the United States by the State of Virginia, was 'occupied by numerous and warlike tribes of Indians; but the exclusive right of the United States to extinguish their title, and to grant the soil, has never, we believe, been doubted.' Id., at 586, 5 L.Ed. 681. See also id., at 591\u2014597, 603, 5 L.Ed. 681. The possessory and treaty rights of Indian tribes to their lands have been the recurring theme of many other cases.5\n\n\n12\nThe rudimentary propositions that Indian title is a matter of federal law and can be extinguished only with federal consent apply in all of the States, including the original 13. It is true that the United States never held fee title to the Indian lands in the original States as it did to almost all the rest of the continental United States and that fee title to Indian lands in these States, or the pre-emptive right to purchase from the Indians, was in the State, Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 3 L.Ed. 162 (1810).6 But this reality did not alter the doctrine that federal law, treaties, and statutes protected Indian occupancy and that its termination was exclusively the province of federal law.\n\n\n13\nFor example, in Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 8 L.Ed. 483 (1832), the State of Georgia sought to prosecute a white man for residing in Indian country contrary to the laws of the State. This Court held the prosecution a nullity, the Chief Justice referring to the treaties with the Cherokees and to the\n\n\n14\n'universal conviction that the Indian nations possessed a      full right to the lands they occupied, until that right      should be extinguished by the United States, with their      consent: that their territory was separated from that of any      state within whose chartered limits they might reside, by a      boundary line, established by treaties: that, within their boundary,      they possessed rights with which no state could interfere:      and that the whole power of regulating the intercourse with      them, was vested in the United States.' Id., at 560, 8 L.Ed.      483.\n\n\n15\nThe Cherokee Nation was said to be occupying its own territory 'in which the laws of Georgia can have no force . . ..' The Georgia law was declared unconstitutional because it interfered with the relations 'between the United States and the Cherokee nation, the regulation of which, according to the settled principles of our constitution, are committed exclusively to the government of the union.' Id., at 561, 8 L.Ed. 483.\n\n\n16\nThere are cases of similar import with respect to the New York Indians. These cases lend substance to petitioners' assertion that the possessory right claimed is a federal right to the lands at issue in this case. Fellows v. Blacksmith, 19 How. 366, 372, 15 L.Ed. 684 (1857), which concerned the Seneca Indians, held that the 'forcible removal (of Indians) must be made, if made at all, under the direction of the United States (and) that this interpretation is in accordance with the usages and practice of the Government in providing for the removal of Indian tribes from their ancient possessions.' In The New York Indians, 5 Wall. 761, 18 L.Ed. 708 (1867), the State sought to tax the reservation lands of the Senecas. The Court held the tax void. The Court referred to the Indian right of occupancy as creating 'an indefeasible title to the reservations that may extend from generation to generation, and will cease only by the dissolution of the tribe, or their consent to sell to the party possessed of the right of pre-emption,' id., at 771, 18 L.Ed. 708, and noted that New York 'possessed no power to deal with Indian rights or title,' id., at 769, 18 L.Ed. 708. Of major importance, however, was the treaty of 1794 in which the United States acknowledged certain territory to be the property of the Seneca Nation and promised that 'it shall remain theirs until they choose to sell the same to the people of the United States . . ..' Id., at 766-767, 18 L.Ed. 708. The rights of the Indians to occupy those lands 'do not depend on . . . any . . . statutes of the State, but upon treaties, which are the supreme law of the land; it is to these treaties we must look to ascertain the nature of these rights, and the extent of them.' Id., at 768, 18 L.Ed. 708.7 The State's attempt to tax reservation lands was invalidated as an interference with Indian possessory rights guaranteed by the Federal Government.\n\n\n17\nMuch later, in United States v. Forness, 125 F.2d 928 (CA2), cert. denied, sub. nom. City of Salamanca v. United States, 316 U.S. 694, 62 S.Ct. 1293, 86 L.Ed. 1764 (1942),8 the Government sued to set aside certain leases granted by the Seneca tribe on certain reservation lands. It was argued in opposition that the suit was merely an action for ejectment which under state law could be defeated by a tender; but the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the Indian rights were federal and that 'state law cannot be invoked to limit the rights in lands granted by the United States to the Indians, because, as the court below recognized, state law does not apply to the Indians except so far as the United States has given its consent.' Id., at 932. There being no federal statute making the statutory or decisional law of the State of New York applicable to the reservations, the controlling law remained federal law; and, absent federal statutory guidance, the governing rule of decision would be fashioned by the federal court in the mode of the common law.9\n\nIII\n\n18\nEnough has been said, we think, to indicate that the complaint in this case asserts a present right to possession under federal law. The claim may fail at a later stage for a variety of reasons; but for jurisdictional purposes, this is not a case where the underlying right or obligation arises only under state law and federal law is merely alleged as a barrier to its effectuation, as was the case in Gully v. First National Bank, 299 U.S. 109, 57 S.Ct. 96, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936). There, the suit was on a contract having its genesis in state law, and the tax that the defendant had promised to pay was imposed by a state statute. The possibility that a federal statute might bar its collection was insufficient to make the case one arising under the laws of the United States.\n\n\n19\nNor in sustaining the jurisdiction of the District Court do we disturb the well-pleaded complaint rule of Taylor v. Anderson, supra, and like cases.10 Here, the right to possession itself is claimed to arise under federal law in the first instance. Allegedly, aboriginal title of an Indian tribe guaranteed by treaty and protected by statute has never been extinguished. In Taylor, the plaintiffs were individual Indians, not an Indian tribe; and the suit concerned lands allocated to individual Indians, not tribal rights to lands. See 32 Stat. 641. Individual patents had been issued with only the right to alienation being restricted for a period of time. Cf. Minnesota v. United States, 305 U.S. 382, 386 n. 1, 59 S.Ct. 292, 294, 83 L.Ed. 235 (1939); McKay v. Kalyton, 204 U.S. 458, 27 S.Ct. 346, 51 L.Ed. 566 (1907). Insofar as the underlying right to possession is concerned, Taylor is more like those cases indicating that 'a controversy in respect of lands has never been regarded as presenting a Federal question merely because one of the parties to it has derived his title under an act of Congress.' Shulthis v. McDougal, 225 U.S. 561, 570, 32 S.Ct. 704, 707, 56 L.Ed. 1205 (1912).11 Once patent issues, the incidents of ownership are, for the most part, matters of local property law to be vindicated in local courts, and in such situations it is normally insufficient for 'arising under' jurisdiction merely to allege that ownership or possession is claimed under a United States patent. Joy v. City of St. Louis, 201 U.S. 332, 342\u2014343, 26 S.Ct. 478, 481, 50 L.Ed. 776 (1906). As the Court stated in Packer v. Bird, 137 U.S. 661, 669, 11 S.Ct. 210, 212, 34 L.Ed. 819 (1891):\n\n\n20\n'The courts of the United States will construe the grants of      the general government without reference to the rules of      construction adopted by the states for their grants; but      whatever incidents or rights attach to the ownership of      property conveyed by the government will be determined by the      states, subject to the condition that their rules do not      impair the efficacy of the grants or the use and enjoyment of      the property by the grantee.'\n\n\n21\nIn the present case, however, the assertion of a federal controversy does not rest solely on the claim of a right to possession derived from a federal grant of title whose scope will be governed by state law. Rather, it rests on the not insubstantial claim that federal law now protects, and has continuously protected from the time of the formation of the United States, possessory rights to tribal lands, wholly apart from the application of state law principles which normally and separately protect a valid right of possession.\n\n\n22\nFor the same reasons, we think the complaint before us satisfies the additional requirement formulated in some cases that the complaint reveal a 'dispute or controversy respecting the validity, construction, or effect of such a law, upon the determination of which the result depends.' Shulthis v. mcDougal, supra, 225 U.S. at 569, 32 S.Ct. at 706; Gold-Washing & Water Co. v. Keyes, 96 U.S. 199, 203, 24 L.Ed. 656 (1878).12 Here, the Oneidas assert a present right to possession based in part on their aboriginal right of occupancy which was not terminable except by act of the United States. Their claim is also asserted to arise from treaties guaranteeing their possessory right until terminated by the United States, and 'it is to these treaties (that) we must look to ascertain the nature of these (Indian) rights, and the extent of them.' The New York Indians, 5 Wall., at 768, 18 L.Ed. 708. Finally, the complaint asserts a claim under the Nonintercourse Acts which put in statutory form what was or came to be the accepted rule\u2014that the extinguishment of Indian title required the consent of the United States. To us, it is sufficiently clear that the controversy stated in the complaint arises under the federal law within the meaning of the jurisdictional statutes and our decided cases.\n\nIV\n\n23\nThis is not to ignore the obvious fact that New York had legitimate and farreaching connections with its Indian tribes antedating the Constitution and that the State has continued to play a substantial role with respect to the Indians in that State.13 There has been recurring tension between federal and state law; state authorities have not easily accepted the notion that federal law and federal courts must be deemed the controlling considerations in dealing with the Indians. Fellows v. Blacksmith, The New York Indians, United States v. Forness, and the Tuscarora litigation are sufficient evidence that the reach and exclusivity of federal law with respect to reservation lands and reservation Indians did not go unchallenged; and it may be that they are to some extent challenged here. But this only underlines the legal reality that the controversy alleged in the complaint may well depend on what the reach and impact of the federal law will prove to be in this case.\n\n\n24\nWe are also aware that New York and federal authorities eventually reached partial agreement in 1948 when criminal jurisdiction over New York Indian reservations was ceded to the State. 62 Stat. 1224, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 232. In addition, in 1950 civil disputes between Indians or between Indians and others were placed within the jurisdiction of the state courts 'to the same extent as the courts of the State shall have jurisdiction in other civil actions and proceedings, as now or hereafter defined by the laws of such State.' 64 Stat. 845, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 233.14 The latter statute, however, provided for the preservation of tribal laws and customs and saved Indian reservation lands from taxation and, with certain exceptions, from execution to satisfy state court judgments. Furthermore, it provided that nothing in the statute 'shall be construed as authorizing the alienation from any Indian nation, tribe, or band of Indians of any lands within any Indian reservation in the State of New York' or as 'conferring jurisdiction on the courts of the State of New York or making applicable the laws of the State of New York in civil actions involving Indian lands or claims with respect thereto which relate to transactions or events transpiring prior to September 13, 1952.' The Senate report on the bill disclaimed any intention of 'impairing any of their property or rights under existing treaties with the United States.' S.Rep.No.1836, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1950). Under the penultimate proviso the matter of alienating tribal reservation lands would appear to have been left precisely where it was prior to the Act.15 Moreover, the final proviso of the statute negativing the application of state law with respect to transactions prior to the adoption of the Act was added by amendment on the floor of the Senate, and its purpose was explained by the gentleman who offered it to be as follows:\n\n\n25\n'Mr. Chairman, I do not think there will be any objection      from any source with regard to this particular amendment.      This just assures the Indians of an absolutely fair and      impartial determination of any claims they might have had      growing out of any relationship they have had with the great      State of New York in regard to their lands.\n\n\n26\n'I think there will be no objection to that; they certainly      ought to have a right to have those claims properly      adjudicated. . . .\n\n\n27\n'In addition thereto, of course, they may go into the           Federal courts and adjudicate any differences they have           had between themselves and the great State of New York           relative to their lands, or claims in regard thereto,           and I am sure that the State of New York should have and           no doubt will have, no objection to such provision.' 96           Cong.Rec. 12460 (1950) (remarks of Congressman Morris).\n\n\n28\nOur conclusion that this case arises under the laws of the United States is, therefore, wholly consistent with and in furtherance of the intent of Congress as expressed by its grant of civil jurisdiction to the State of New York with the indicated exceptions.16\n\n\n29\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n30\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n31\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n32\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Mr. Justice POWELL joins, concurring.\n\n\n33\nThe majority opinion persuasively demonstrates that the plaintiffs' right to possession in this case was and is rooted firmly in federal law. Thus, I agree that this is not a case which depends for its federal character solely on possible federal defenses or on expected responses to possible defenses. I also agree that the majority decision is consistent with our decision in Gully v. First National Bank, 299 U.S. 109, 57 S.Ct. 96, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936). However, I think it worthwhile to add a brief concurrence to emphasize that the majority opinion does not disturb the long line of this Court's cases narrowly applying the principles of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and the well-pleaded complaint rule to possessory land actions brought in federal court.\n\n\n34\nAs the majority seems willing to accept, the complaint in this action is basically one in ejectment. Plaintiffs are out of possession; the defendants are in possession, allegedly wrongfully; and the plaintiffs claim damages because of the allegedly wrongful possession. These allegations appear to meet the pleading requirements for an ejectment action as stated in Taylor v. Anderson, 234 U.S. 74, 34 S.Ct. 724, 58 L.Ed. 1218 (1914). Thus the complaint must be judged according to the rules applicable to such cases.\n\n\n35\nThe federal courts have traditionally been inhospitable forums for plaintiffs asserting federal-question jurisdiction of possessory land claims. The narrow view of the scope of federal-question jurisdiction taken by the federal courts in such cases probably reflects a recognition that federal issues were seldom apt to be dispositive of the lawsuit. Commonly, the grant of a land patent to a private party carries with it no guarantee of continuing federal interest and certainly carries with it no indefinitely redeemable passport into federal court. On the contrary, as the majority points out, the land thus conveyed was generally subject to state law thereafter.\n\n\n36\nThus, this Court's decisions have established a strict rule that mere allegation of a federal source of title does not convert an ordinary ejectment action into a federal case. As the Court noted in Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter, 177 U.S. 505, 507, 20 S.Ct. 726, 44 L.Ed. 864 (1900), 'a suit to enforce a right which takes its origin in the laws of the United States is not necessarily one arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, within the meaning of the jurisdiction clauses, for if it did every action to establish title to real estate (at least in the newer States) would be such a one, as all titles in those States come from the United States or by virtue of its laws.' This rule was even applied to cases in which land grants to Indians, subject to limited restrictions on alienation, were involved. See Taylor, supra.\n\n\n37\nThe majority today finds this strict rule inapplicable to this case, and for good reason. In contrast to the typical instance in which the Federal Government conveys land to a private entity, the Government, by transferring land rights to Indian tribes, has not placed the land beyond federal supervision. Rather the Federal Government has shown a continuing solicitude for the rights of the Indians in their land. The Nonintercourse Act of 1790 manifests this concern in statutory form. Thus, the Indians' right to possession in this case is based not solely on the original grant of rights in the land but also upon the Federal Government's subsequent guarantee. Their claim is clearly distinguishable from the claims of land grantees for whom the Federal Government has taken no such responsibility.\n\n\n38\nThe opinion for the Court today should give no comfort to persons with garden-variety ejectment claims who, for one reason or another, are covetously eyeing the door to the federal courthouse. The general standards for determining federal jurisdiction, and in particular the standards for evaluating compliance with the well-pleaded complaint rule, will retain their traditional vigor tomorrow as today.\n\n\n\n1\n Section 1331(a) provides:\n'The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions wherein the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.'\nUnder \u00a7 1362:\n'The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions, brought by any Indian tribe or band with a governing body duly recognized by the Secretary of the Interior, wherein the matter in controversy arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.'\n\n\n2\n Initially, only diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 was alleged in the complaint. The necessary jurisdictional amount was averred. Federal-question jurisdiction was asserted by an amendment to the complaint. Jurisdiction under \u00a7 1332 was rejected by the District Court and the Court of Appeals and is not at issue here.\n\n\n3\n Three treaties with the Six Indian Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy in New York were alleged: the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1784, which provides in part that '(t)he Oneida and Tuscarora nations shall be secured in the possession of the lands on which they are settled'; The Treaty of Fort Harmar of 1789 where the Oneida and the Tuscarora nations were 'again secured and confirmed in the possession of their respective lands'; and the Treaty of Canandaigua of 1794, Art. II of which provides: 'The United States acknowledge the lands reserved to the Oneida, Onondaga and Cayuga Nations, in their respective treaties with the state of New-York, and called their reservations, to be their property; and the United States will never claim the same, nor disturb them . . . in the free use and enjoyment thereof: but the said reservations shall remain theirs, until they choose to sell the same to the people of the United States, who have the right to purchase.' The treaties referred to are found at 7 Stat. 15, 7 Stat. 33, and 7 Stat. 44, respectively.\n\n\n4\n Section 4 of the Act provided that 'no sale of lands made by any Indians, or any nation or tribe of Indians within the United States, shall be valid to any person or persons, or to any state, whether having the right of pre-emption to such lands or not, unless the same shall be made and duly executed at some public treaty, held under the authority of the United States.' The second Nonintercourse Act passed in 1793 made it a misdemeanor to negotiate for Indian lands without federal authority, but it was made lawful for state agents who were present at any treaty held with the Indians under the authority of the United States, in the presence and with the approbation of the United States Commissioner, 'to propose to, and adjust with the Indians, the compensation to be made for their claims to lands within such state, which shall be extinguished by the treaty.' 1 Stat. 329, 330\u2014331 \u00a7 8. This statutory policy, without major change, was carried forward in \u00a7 12 of the 1796 Act, 1 Stat. 469, 472; \u00a7 12 of the 1799 Act, 1 Stat. 743, 746; \u00a7 12 of the 1802 Act, 2 Stat. 139, 143; \u00a7 12 of the Act of 1834, 4 Stat. 729, 730\u2014731; and in Rev.Stat. \u00a7 2116, now 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 177.\n\n\n5\n Representative of almost countless cases are Cherokee Nation v.

Georgia, supra, 5 Pet., at 38, 8 L.Ed. 25; Clark v. Smith, 13 Pet. 195, 10 L.Ed. 123 (1839); Lattimer's Lessee v. Poteet, 14 Pet. 4, 10 L.Ed. 328 (1840); Seneca Nation v.

'Outside of the territory of the original colonies, the ultimate fee is located in the United States and may be granted to individuals subject to the Indian right of occupancy.' Federal Indian Law 599; Missouri v. Iowa, 7 How. 660, 12 L.Ed. 861 (1849).\n\n\n7\n In an earlier case, New York ex rel. Cutler v. Dibble, 21 How. 366, 16 L.Ed. 149 (1859), the Court had upheld New York statutes which protected the Indians from intrusion by others on their tribal lands, and had asserted that '(n)otwithstanding the peculiar relation which these Indian nations hold to the Government of the United States, the State of New York had the power of a sovereign over their persons and property, so far as it was necessary to preserve the peace of the Commonwealth, and protect these feeble and helpless bands from imposition and intrusion.' Id., at 370, 16 L.Ed. 149. It is apparent that by the later decision in The New York Indians, supra, the Court did not consider the potential implications of the dictum expressed in Dibble applicable in situations where the State's power was exercised other than for the protection of the Indians on their tribal lands. In any event, whatever Dibble may have held with respect to state power to protect Indian possession, it does not question the Indians' right to possession under federal law.\n\n\n8\n The question of the application of federal law to Indian tribal property in New York was litigated in the state courts in the intervening years as well. In 1870, an unreported decision of the New York Supreme Court held that tribal leases of Seneca reservation lands, ratified by the New York Legislature, were invalid in the absence of approval from the United States. See United States v. Forness, supra, at 930\u2014931; H.R.Rep.Misc.Doc.No.75, 43d\nCong., 2d Sess. (1875); Brief for the Warden and the State of New York 26\u201427, New York ex rel. Ray v. Martin, No. 158, O.T.1945, 326 U.S. 496, 66 S.Ct. 307, 90 L.Ed. 261 (1946). In the mid-1890's, in Buffalo, R. & P.R. Co. v. Lavery, 75 Hun. 396, 27 N.Y.S. 443 (5th Dept., App.Div.1894), affirmed on opinion below, 149 N.Y. 576, 43 N.E. 986 (1896), a private non-Indian lessee of Indian land under a lease first granted by the Senecas in 1866, which was concededly not legally effective until an 1875 Act of Congress validated such leases, was nonetheless held to have priority over a railroad claiming under an 1872 lease from the Senecas and a state statute purportedly validating the lease as one to a railroad which had been ratified by a state court, because the state statute which would have given the railroad a superior right to possession was incapable of confirming possessory rights to Indian tribal lands without federal authority. The New York courts held that it was 'not within the legislative power of the State to enable the Indian nation to make, or others to take from the Indians, grants or leases of lands within their reservations. In that matter the Federal government, having the power under the Constitution to do so, has assumed to control it by . . . act of Congress (referring to the Indian Nonintercourse Act). . . . As respects their lands, subject only to the pre-emptive title, the Indians are treated as the wards of the United States, and it is only pursuant to the Federal authority that their lands can be granted or demised by or acquired by conveyance or leased from them.' 75 Hun., at 399\u2014400, 27 N.Y.S., at 445.\nStill later, in People ex rel. Cusick v. Daly, 212 N.Y. 183, 105 N.E. 1048 (1914), the New York Court of Appeals held that without the consent of Congress New York could not prosecute Indian crimes on reservations. Relying on the classic federal cases, the court held that federal power was pre-eminent and that the Federal Government had made treaties with the Indians which confirmed their territorial possession, although the Federal Government never owned the fee of the land within the State's confines. Id., at 192, 105 N.E. 1048. Within the reservation federal power, when exercised, foreclosed the exercise of power by the State. 'It is said that there is a difference between the Indians whose reservations are the direct gift of the federal government and those whose reservations have been derived from\nthe state or from other sources. We find no such distinction in the statute, and we can think of none that logically differentiates one from the other. Even if we assume that, in the absence of federal legislation, the state has the most ample power to legislate for the Indians within its borders, there seems to be no escape from the conclusion that when Congress does act the power of the state must yield to the paramount authority of the federal government.' Id., at 196\u2014197, 105 N.E., at 1052.\n\n\n9\n Still later, federal authority over Indian lands was again challenged. In Tuscarora Nation of Indians v. Power Authority, 257 F.2d 885 (1958), the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected New York's claim that the Nonintercourse Act did not apply to the State of New York and that, as one of the original 13 States, it never surrendered to the United States its power to condemn Indian lands. The Court of Appeals also held that the Act of Sept. 13, 1950, 64 Stat. 845, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 233, whereby the United States ceded civil jurisdiction over Indian reservations to the State of New York, expressly and effectively excepted from its coverage the alienation of reservation lands, a matter over which the United States had reaffirmed its paramount authority. Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals held that the Niagara River Power Project Act, 71 Stat. 401 (1957), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 836, 836a, by which Congress directed the Federal Power Commission to issue a license to the New York Power Authority for the construction and operation of a power\nproject to utilize water made available to the United States by a 1950 treaty with Canada, constituted federal authorization for the Power Authority to exercise the right of eminent domain, but only in accordance with \u00a7 21 of the Federal Power Act, 41 Stat. 1074, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 814, which permits the acquisition of sites for the purpose of developing waterways by the exercise of the right of eminent domain in the federal district court in which the land is located or in the state courts. Because the Power Authority had proceeded to appropriate a portion of the Tuscaroras' reservation lands by filing a map and other documents pursuant to procedures established by the State's Highway Law and Public Authorities Law, those proceedings were vacated and annulled. Subsequently, the Power Authority abandoned efforts to obtain possession of the land by appropriation pursuant to those statutes and instead proceeded by condemnation proceedings in the District Court for the Western District of New York. The Tuscaroras petitioned for review of the Court of Appeals decision, but the Court denied certiorari. 358 U.S. 841, 79 S.Ct. 66, 3 L.Ed.2d 76 (1958). The Superintendent of Public Works of the State of New York simultaneously appealed from it under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(2), and the Court, on the Tuscaroras' subsequent suggestion of mootness, which the Power Authority supported and the Superintendent continued to oppose, and which was based on the Power Authority's abandonment of its appropriation proceedings in favor of the condemnation suit, vacated the Court of Appeals' judgment and remanded to the District Court with directions to dismiss the complaint as moot. 362 U.S. 608, 80 S.Ct. 960, 4 L.Ed.2d 1009 (1960).

Martin, No. 158, O.T.1945, 326 U.S. 496, 66 S.Ct. 307, 90 L.Ed. 261 (1946).\n\n\n14\n Section 233 provides:\n'Jurisdiction of New York State courts in civil actions.\n'The courts of the State of New York under the laws of such State shall have jurisdiction in civil actions and proceedings between Indians or between one or more Indians and any other person or persons to the same extent as the courts of the State shall have jurisdiction in other civil actions and proceedings, as now or hereafter defined by the laws of such Stat: Provided, That the governing body of any recognized tribe of Indians in the State of New York shall have the right to declare, by appropriate enactment prior to September 13, 1952, those tribal laws and customs which they desire to preserve, which, on certification to the Secretary of the Interior by the governing body of such tribe shall be published in the Federal Register and thereafter shall govern in all civil cases involving reservation Indians when the subject matter of such tribal laws and customs is involved or at issue, but nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent such courts from recognizing and giving effect to any tribal law or custom which may be proven to the satisfaction of such courts: Provided further, That nothing in this section shall be construed to require any such tribe or the members thereof to obtain fish and game licenses from the State of New York for the exercise of any hunting and fishing rights provided for such Indians under any agreement, treaty, or custom:\nProvided further, That nothing herein contained shall be construed as subjecting the lands within any Indian reservation in the State of New York to taxation for State or local purposes, nor as subjecting any such lands, or any Federal or State annuity in favor of Indians or Indian tribes, to execution on any judgment rendered in the State courts, except in the enforcement of a judgment in a suit by one tribal member against another in the matter of the use or possession of land: And provided further, That nothing herein contained shall be construed as authorizing the alienation from any Indian nation, tribe, or band of Indians of any lands within any Indian reservation in the State of New York: Provided further, That nothing herein contained shall be construed as conferring jurisdiction on the courts of the State of New York or making applicable the laws of the State of New York in civil actions involving Indian lands or claims with respect thereto which relate to transactions or events transpiring prior to September 13, 1952.'\n\n\n15\n 'The text and history of the new legislation are replete with indications that congressional consent is necessary to validate the\nexercise of state power over tribal Indians and, most significantly, that New York cannot unilaterally deprive Indians of their tribal lands or authorize such deprivations. The civil jurisdiction law, to make assurance doubly sure, contains a proviso that explicitly exempts reservations from state and local taxation and that negatives any authorization of 'the alienation from any Indian nation, tribe, or band or Indians of any land within any Indian reservation in the State of New York.' The Senate Committee's report on that law emphasizes that 'State law does not apply to Indians except so far as the United States has given its consent' and points out that the law provides that 'no lands within any reservation be alienated.' During the congressional hearings, most Indian leaders continued to oppose the bills, partly because of fear of state attempts to deprive them of their reservations, despite the New York Joint Committee's repeated assurances. Accordingly, New York's representatives once more disavowed any intention to break up the reservations and, more clearly than some state officials in the history of the controversy, disclaimed any state power to do so. Moreover, both federal and state officials agreed that the bills would retain ultimate federal power over the Indians and that federal guardianship, particularly with respect to property rights, would continue.' Gunther, supra, n. 13, 8 Buffalo L.Rev., at 16. (Footnotes omitted.)\n\n\n16\n Because of our determination that the complaint states a controversy arising under the laws of the United States sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the District Court under \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1362, in accordance with prior decisions of this Court, we have no occasion to address and do not reach the contention pressed by petitioners that the Congress, in enacting \u00a7 1362 in 1966, 80 Stat. 880, intended to expand the scope of 'arising under' jurisdiction in the District Courts, beyond what judicial interpretations of that language have allowed under \u00a7 1331, for that category of suits brought by Indian tribes, in addition to eliminating the amount in controversy requirement when Indian tribes sue.\n\n\n","label":1}

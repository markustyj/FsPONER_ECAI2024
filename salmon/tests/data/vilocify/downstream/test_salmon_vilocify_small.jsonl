Plantronics Hub for Mac does not support firmware updates for these devices. On the MDA220 (Product ID 0xAD04), the serial number is not reported correctly in Plantronics Hub for Windows and Mac. It is also not accurately reported to Plantronics Manager Pro. Lost audio connections may occur if the BT600 is unplugged and then plugged back in. Users must shut down Plantronics Hub and re-start it to regain audio connection. During a firmware update, if an MDA220 becomes bricked, Plantronics Hub can no longer detect the device. Support for local firmware update for BT300 (Product ID = 417) is not available. On Cisco Jabber call, audio unmutes when user joins a non-audio Skype for Business meeting. On Plantronics Hub for Mac, the call end button on the headset may not reliably work during a softphone call on Voyager 8200 with a BT600 and on Blackwire C320, C720. Unplugging the following devices during the firmware update process may result in the recovery process not working correctly: Blackwire C315, C325. After wearing sensor is turned off for Blackwire 710\/720, Plantronics Hub still shows sensor-dependent settings as ON yet they do not work. When using the call button to flash between an active call and a call on hold using Avaya Communicator 2.1, both calls may be put in a hold state and may require using the softphone user interface to resume the call.To ensure accurate data in Plantronics Manager Pro reports, customers using Avaya Equinox should open the softphone client prior to opening Plantronics Hub for Windows.

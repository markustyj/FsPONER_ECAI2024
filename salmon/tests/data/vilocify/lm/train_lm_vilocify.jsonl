{"text":"Apache Flink 1.3.0 Release Announcement The Apache Flink community is pleased to announce the 1.3.0 release. Over the past 4 months, the Flink community has been working hard to resolve more than 680 issues. See the complete changelog for more detail. This is the fourth major release in the 1.x.y series. It is API compatible with the other 1.x.y releases for APIs annotated with the @Public annotation. Users can expect Flink releases now in a 4 month cycle. At the beginning of the 1.3 release cycle, the community decided to follow a strict time-based release model. We encourage everyone to download the release and check out the documentation. Feedback through the Flink mailing lists is, as always, gladly encouraged! You can find the binaries on the updated Downloads page. Some highlights of the release are listed below. Large State Handling\/Recovery   Incremental Checkpointing for RocksDB: It is now possible to checkpoint only the difference from the previous successful checkpoint, rather than checkpointing the entire application state. This speeds up checkpointing and saves disk space, because the individual checkpoints are smaller. (FLINK-5053).   Asynchronous snapshots for heap-based state backends: The filesystem and memory statebackends now also support asynchronous snapshots using a copy-on-write HashMap implementation. Asynchronous snapshotting makes Flink more resilient to slow storage systems and expensive serialization. The time an operator blocks on a snapshot is reduced to a minimum (FLINK-6048, FLINK-5715).   Allow upgrades to state serializers: Users can now upgrade serializers, while keeping their application state. One use case of this is upgrading custom serializers used for managed operator state\/keyed state. Also, registration order for POJO types\/Kryo types is now no longer fixed (Documentation, FLINK-6178).   Recover job state at the granularity of operator: Before Flink 1.3, operator state was bound to Flink\u2019s internal \u201cTask\u201d representation. This made it hard to change a job\u2019s topology while keeping its state around. With this change, users are allowed to do more topology changes (un-chain operators) by restoring state into logical operators instead of \u201cTasks\u201d (FLINK-5892).   Fine-grained recovery (beta): Instead of restarting the complete ExecutionGraph in case of a task failure, Flink is now able to restart only the affected subgraph and thereby significantly decrease recovery time (FLINK-4256).   DataStream API   Side Outputs: This change allows users to have more than one output stream for an operator. Operator metadata, internal system information (debugging, performance etc.) or rejected\/late elements are potential use-cases for this new API feature. The Window operator is now using this new feature for late window elements (Side Outputs Documentation, FLINK-4460).   Union Operator State: Flink 1.2.0 introduced broadcast state functionality, but this had not yet been exposed via a public API. Flink 1.3.0 provides the Union Operator State API for exposing broadcast operator state. The union state will send the entire state across all parallel instances to each instance on restore, giving each operator a full view of the state (FLINK-5991).   Per-Window State: Previously, the state that a WindowFunction or ProcessWindowFunction could access was scoped to the key of the window but not the window itself. With this new feature, users can keep window state independent of the key (FLINK-5929).   Deployment and Tooling   Flink HistoryServer: Flink\u2019s HistoryServer now allows you to query the status and statistics of completed jobs that have been archived by a JobManager (FLINK-1579).   Watermark Monitoring in Web Front-end: For easier diagnosis of watermark issues, the Flink JobManager front-end now provides a new tab to track the watermark of each operator (FLINK-3427).   Datadog HTTP Metrics Reporter: Datadog is a widely-used metrics system, and Flink now offers a Datadog reporter that contacts the Datadog http endpoint directly (FLINK-6013).   Network Buffer Configuration: We finally got rid of the tedious network buffer configuration and replaced it with a more generic approach. First of all, you may now follow the idiom \u201cmore is better\u201d without any penalty on the latency which could previously occur due to excessive buffering in incoming and outgoing channels. Secondly, instead of defining an absolute number of network buffers, we now use fractions of the available JVM memory (10% by default). This should cover more use cases by default and may also be tweaked by defining a minimum and maximum size. \u2192 See Configuring the Network Buffers in the Flink documentation.   Table API \/ SQL   Support for Retractions in Table API \/ SQL: As part of our endeavor to support continuous queries on Dynamic Tables, Retraction is an important building block that will enable a whole range of new applications which require updating previously-emitted results. Examples for such use cases are computation of early results for long-running windows, updates due to late arriving data, or maintaining constantly changing results similar to materialized views in relational database systems. Flink 1.3.0 supports retraction for non-windowed aggregates. Results with updates can be either converted into a DataStream or materialized to external data stores using TableSinks with upsert or retraction support.  Extended support for aggregations in Table API \/ SQL: With Flink 1.3.0, the Table API and SQL support many more types of aggregations, including       GROUP BY window aggregations in SQL (via the window functions TUMBLE, HOP, and SESSION windows) for both batch and streaming.   SQL OVER window aggregations (only for streaming)   Non-windowed aggregations (in streaming with retractions).   User-defined aggregation functions for custom aggregation logic.    External catalog support: The Table API & SQL allows to register external catalogs. Table API and SQL queries can then have access to table sources and their schema from the external catalogs without register those tables one by one.  \u2192 See the Flink documentation for details about these features.    The Table API \/ SQL documentation is currently being reworked. The community plans to publish the updated docs in the week of June 5th.  Connectors   ElasticSearch 5.x support: The ElasticSearch connectors have been restructured to have a common base module and specific modules for ES 1, 2 and 5, similar to how the Kafka connectors are organized. This will make fixes and future improvements available across all ES versions (FLINK-4988).   Allow rescaling the Kinesis Consumer: Flink 1.2.0 introduced rescalable state for DataStream programs. With Flink 1.3, the Kinesis Consumer also makes use of that engine feature (FLINK-4821).   Transparent shard discovery for Kinesis Consumer: The Kinesis consumer can now discover new shards without failing \/ restarting jobs when a resharding is happening (FLINK-4577).   Allow setting custom start positions for the Kafka consumer: With this change, you can instruct Flink\u2019s Kafka consumer to start reading messages from a specific offset (FLINK-3123) or earliest \/ latest offset (FLINK-4280) without respecting committed offsets in Kafka.   Allow out-opt from offset committing for the Kafka consumer: By default, Kafka commits the offsets to the Kafka broker once a checkpoint has been completed. This change allows users to disable this mechanism (FLINK-3398).   CEP Library The CEP library has been greatly enhanced and is now able to accommodate more use-cases out-of-the-box (expressivity enhancements), make more efficient use of the available resources, adjust to changing runtime conditions\u2013all without breaking backwards compatibility of operator state. Please note that the API of the CEP library has been updated with this release. Below are some of the main features of the revamped CEP library:   Make CEP operators rescalable: Flink 1.2.0 introduced rescalable state for DataStream programs. With Flink 1.3, the CEP library also makes use of that engine feature (FLINK-5420).   New operators for the CEP library:   Quantifiers (*,+,?) for the pattern API (FLINK-3318)   Support for different continuity requirements (FLINK-6208)   Support for iterative conditions (FLINK-6197)     Gelly Library  Unified driver for running Gelly examples FLINK-4949). PageRank algorithm for directed graphs (FLINK-4896). Add Circulant and Echo graph generators (FLINK-6393).  Known Issues    There are two known issues in Flink 1.3.0. Both will be addressed in the 1.3.1 release.

{"text":"CrowdStrike TECH ALERT: Windows sensor 5.19.10101 pulled from production   TECH ALERT: Windows sensor 5.19.10101 pulled from production  Update CrowdStrike engineering continues to work towards a resolution for customers still experiencing BSOD crashes after upgrade to 5.19.10101. This issue is our top priority, and we have\u00a0provided remediation steps below.  Summary Windows sensor version 5.19.10101 is no longer available as a selection in sensor update policies within the Falcon console.\u00a0 Sensor update policies set to \u201cAuto\u201d will downgrade back to Windows sensor 5.18.9905. Any update policies already locked to Windows sensor 5.18.9905 before we rolled back the release, will remain on this version. Description Select customers running a certain 3rd party endpoint product have reported that machines may experience a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) crash after upgrading to this version. Initial customer data shows at least one root cause where the interaction of the DLP component of the 3rd party product with new sensor code changes is involved. Due to this initial customer feedback and out of an abundance of caution, we have pulled Windows sensor version 5.19.10101 and are building a hotfix without these changes. Upon completion of the investigation and confirmation of the root cause, we will resolve the issue by providing a hotfix.\u00a0 Recommendation CrowdStrike recommends changing your sensor update policies that have been manually set to version 5.19.10101 to 5.18.9905. To Remediate the issue  Boot into Safe Mode  https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/12376\/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode  Note: For customers with Bitlocker enabled, they may require their Bitlocker keys to enter Safe Mode (see article for details)  If Safe Mode boot fails, perform the following steps:  At the Automatic Repair failure screen, click the Advanced Options button  Click the Troubleshoot button  Click the Advanced Options button  Click the Command Prompt button  Authenticate with administrator credentials if prompted  Find the system drive with the Windows folder present. It will NOT be X: and will likely not match what it typically is within Windows.  E.g. in this environment, C: may be the boot partition, and D: may be the system drive.\u00a0   Once found, run: del \\windows\\system32\\drivers\\crowdstrike\\csboot.sys  Close the Command Prompt  Click the Troubleshoot button  Click the Advanced Options button  Click the Startup Settings button  Click the Restart button  Press 4 to boot into Safe Mode  Continue at Step 2 below    Delete HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\CSAgent  Delete HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\CSFalconService  Delete C:\\Windows\\system32\\drivers\\CrowdStrike\\10101-*.exe  Reboot (into normal mode, not Safe Mode)  IF THE CUSTOMER SEES TWO ENTRIES for CrowdStrike Windows Sensor in Add\/Remove Programs\u2026  On 64-bit Windows, delete HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\{20cb6d05-7fae-4433-b7f0-b8691db60f5e}  On 32-bit Windows, delete HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\{2faf4b31-5bc5-4914-b463-34ca618fa1e1}  Run (case-sensitive): CSUninstallTool.exe NO_START=1  If prompted for a maintenance token, enter any character in the textbox to continue.

This vulnerability is triggered by an authenticated user; however, authentication can be bypassed. According to the official documentation for installation step 10, an admin is required to upload all the files, including the .htaccess files, and run a health check. However, what is overlooked is that the Apache HTTP Server by default no longer enables the AllowOverride directive, leading to data\/users\/admin.xml password exposure. The passwords are hashed but this can be bypassed by starting with the data\/other\/authorization.xml API key. This allows one to target the session state, since they decided to roll their own implementation. The cookie_name is crafted information that can be leaked from the frontend (site name and version). If a someone leaks the API key and the admin username, then they can bypass authentication. To do so, they need to supply a cookie based on an SHA-1 computation of this known information. The vulnerability exists in the admin\/theme-edit.php file. This file checks for forms submissions via POST requests, and for the csrf nonce. If the nonce sent is correct, then the file provided by the user is uploaded. There is a path traversal allowing write access outside the jailed themes directory root. Exploiting the traversal is not necessary because the .htaccess file is ignored. A contributing factor is that there isn't another check on the extension before saving the file, with the assumption that the parameter content is safe. This allows the creation of web accessible and executable files with arbitrary content.2019-05-225.0CVE-2019-11231MISCMISCgitlab -- gitlabGitLab CE\/EE versions 8.18 up to 11.x before 11.3.11, 11.4.x before 11.4.8, and 11.5.x before 11.5.1 have CRLF Injection in Project Mirroring when using the Git protocol.2019-05-175.0CVE-2018-19585MISCMISCgitlab -- gitlabAn insecure permissions issue was discovered in GitLab Community and Enterprise Edition 9.4 and later but before 11.4.13, 11.5.x before 11.5.6, and 11.6.x before 11.6.1.

According to the OpenPGP Message Format specification in RFC 4880 chapter 7, a cleartext signed message can contain one or more optional \"Hash\" Armor Headers. The \"Hash\" Armor Header specifies the message digest algorithm(s) used for the signature. However, the Go clearsign package ignores the value of this header, which allows an attacker to spoof it. Consequently, an attacker can lead a victim to believe the signature was generated using a different message digest algorithm than what was actually used. Moreover, since the library skips Armor Header parsing in general, an attacker can not only embed arbitrary Armor Headers, but also prepend arbitrary text to cleartext messages without invalidating the signatures.2019-05-224.3CVE-2019-11841MISCMISCMISCMISCgoogle -- chromeIncorrect inheritance of a new document's policy in Content Security Policy in Google Chrome prior to 73.0.3683.75 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.2019-05-234.3CVE-2019-5799MISCMISCgoogle -- chromeInsufficient policy enforcement in Blink in Google Chrome prior to 73.0.3683.75 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.2019-05-234.3CVE-2019-5800MISCMISCgoogle -- chromeIncorrect eliding of URLs in Omnibox in Google Chrome on iOS prior to 73.0.3683.75 allowed a remote attacker to perform domain spoofing via a crafted HTML page.2019-05-234.3CVE-2019-5801MISCMISCgoogle -- chromeInsufficient policy enforcement in Content Security Policy in Google Chrome prior to 73.0.3683.75 allowed a remote attacker to bypass content security policy via a crafted HTML page.2019-05-234.3CVE-2019-5803MISCMISCibm -- api_connectIBM API Connect 5.0.0.0, and 5.0.8.6 could could return sensitive information that could provide critical information as to the underlying software stack in CMC UI headers.

The vulnerability allows for abusing the application for fraud or unauthorized access to certain information. The attack requires a valid user account to connect to the Blue Prism server, but the roles associated to this account are not required to have any permissions. First of all, the application files are modified to grant full permissions on the client side. In a test environment (or his own instance of the software) an attacker is able to grant himself full privileges also on the server side. He can then, for instance, create a process with malicious behavior and export it to disk. With the modified client, it is possible to import the exported file as a release and overwrite any existing process in the database. Eventually, the bots execute the malicious process. The server does not check the user's permissions for the aforementioned actions, such that a modification of the client software enables this kind of attack. Possible scenarios may involve changing bank accounts or setting passwords.2019-05-24not yet calculatedCVE-2019-11875MISCMISCbluecats -- bluecats_reveal_for_iosThe iOS mobile application BlueCats Reveal before 5.14 stores the username and password in the app cache as base64 encoded strings, i.e. clear text.

{"text":"MySQL Community Server 8.0.13 has been released (part 1\/2) (no replies)  [Due to size limitation, this announcement is split in two. This is part 1]    Dear MySQL users,   MySQL Server 8.0.13, a new version of the popular Open Source  Database Management System, has been released. MySQL 8.0.13 is  recommended for use on production systems.   For an overview of what's new in MySQL 8.0, please see   http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/8.0\/en\/mysql-nutshell.html   For information on installing MySQL 8.0.13 on new servers, please see  the MySQL installation documentation at   http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/8.0\/en\/installing.html   MySQL Server 8.0.13 is available in source and binary form for a number of  platforms from the \"Development Releases\" selection of our download  pages at   http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/downloads\/mysql\/   MySQL Server 8.0.13 is also available from our repository for Linux  platforms, go here for details:   http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/downloads\/repo\/   Windows packages are available via the Installer for Windows:   http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/downloads\/installer\/   along with .ZIP (no-install) packages for more advanced needs.    8.0.13 also comes with a web installer as an alternative to the full  installer.   The web installer doesn't come bundled with any actual products  and instead relies on download-on-demand to fetch only the  products you choose to install. This makes the initial download  much smaller but increases install time as the individual products  will need to be downloaded.   We welcome and appreciate your feedback, bug reports, bug fixes,  patches, etc.:   http:\/\/bugs.mysql.com\/report.php   The following link lists the changes in the MySQL 8.0 since  the release of MySQL 8.0.12. It may also be viewed  online at   http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/relnotes\/mysql\/8.0\/en\/news-8-0-13.html   Enjoy!     Changes in MySQL 8.0.13 (2018-10-22)        * Account Management Notes       * Compilation Notes       * Configuration Notes       * Data Type Notes       * Deprecation and Removal Notes       * Error Handling       * INFORMATION_SCHEMA Notes       * Logging Notes       * Optimizer Notes       * Packaging Notes       * Performance Schema Notes       * Security Notes       * Spatial Data Support       * SQL Syntax Notes       * XA Transaction Notes       * X Plugin Notes       * Functionality Added or Changed       * Bugs Fixed  Account Management Notes        * It is now possible to require that attempts to change an        account password be verified by specifying the current        password to be replaced. This enables DBAs to prevent        users from changing a password without proving that they        know the current password. It is possible to establish        password-verification policy globally using the        password_require_current system variable, as well as on a        per-account basis using the PASSWORD REQUIRE option of        the CREATE USER and ALTER USER statements. Together with        existing password-management capabilities, the new        capability of requiring verification provides DBAs more        complete control over password management. For more        information, see Password Management        (http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/8.0\/en\/password-management.html).        Important        MySQL implements the password-verification capability        using a new column in the mysql.user system table. If you        upgrade to this MySQL release from an earlier version,        you must run mysql_upgrade (and restart the server) to        incorporate this system database change. Until this is        done, password changes are not possible.  Compilation Notes        * Solaris: MySQL now can be compiled on Solaris using gcc.        (Bug #27802681)  Configuration Notes        * The new WITH_LTO CMake option controls whether to enable        link-time optimization. Currently, this is supported only        by GCC 7 and 8. (Bug #28184537, Bug #28211382)       * The new WITH_RAPIDJSON CMake option controls whether to        compile with the bundled or system RapidJSON library.        (Bug #28024992, Bug #90867)       * The CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE CMake option now supports a Release        build type, which is like the RelWithDebInfo build type        but omits debugging information to reduce the build size.        (Bug #27874068)       * The new sql_require_primary_key system variable makes it        possible to have statements that create new tables or        alter the structure of existing tables enforce the        requirement that tables have a primary key. Enabling this        variable helps avoid performance problems in row-based        replication that can occur when tables have no primary        key. Suppose that a table has no primary key and an        update or delete modifies multiple rows. On the master        server, this operation can be performed using a single        table scan but, when replicated using row-based        replication, results in a table scan for each row to be        modified on the slave. With a primary key, these table        scans do not occur. (Bug #17468242, Bug #69845, Bug        #17005592, Bug #69223)       * To enable the server to listen on a set of addresses, the        --bind-address option now permits a list of        comma-separated IP addresses or host names, not just a        single address or name. For details, see Server Command        Options        (http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/8.0\/en\/server-options.html).  Data Type Notes        * MySQL now supports use of expressions as default values        in data type specifications. This includes the use of        expressions as default values for the BLOB, TEXT,        GEOMETRY, and JSON data types, which previously could not        be assigned default values at all. For details, see Data        Type Default Values        (http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/8.0\/en\/data-type-defaults.html).  Deprecation and Removal Notes        * InnoDB; Partitioning: Support for placing table        partitions in shared tablespaces was removed. Shared        tablespaces include the system tablespace and general        tablespaces. For information about identifying partitions        in shared tablespaces and moving them to file-per-table        tablespaces, see Preparing Your Installation for Upgrade        (http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/8.0\/en\/upgrade-prerequisites.html).       * InnoDB: Support for TABLESPACE = innodb_file_per_table        and TABLESPACE = innodb_temporary clauses with CREATE        TEMPORARY TABLE is deprecated and will be removed in a        future MySQL version.       * The utf8mb3 character set is deprecated and will be        removed in a future MySQL release. Please use utf8mb4        instead.       * Nested comments have never been supported (although they        might be permitted under some conditions), but now are        considered deprecated and will be removed in a future        MySQL release.       * The deprecated metadata_locks_cache_size and        metadata_locks_hash_instances system variables were        removed.       * The PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH SQL mode has been deprecated        and will be removed in a future MySQL version.  Error Handling        * The MySQL client library now returns better error        messages for OpenSSL errors. Thanks to Facebook for the        patch. (Bug #27855668, Bug #90418)       * Previously, the ER_NO_REFERENCED_ROW_2 and        ER_ROW_IS_REFERENCED_2 error messages for foreign key        operations were displayed and revealed information about        parent tables, even when the user had no parent table        access privileges. Error handling for this situation has        been revised:            + If the user does have table-level privileges for all             parent tables, ER_NO_REFERENCED_ROW_2 and             ER_ROW_IS_REFERENCED_2 are displayed, the same as             before.            + If the user does not have table-level privileges for             all parent tables, more generic error messages are             displayed instead (ER_NO_REFERENCED_ROW and             ER_ROW_IS_REFERENCED).        An exception is that, for stored programs defined to        execute with DEFINER privileges, the user against which        privileges are assessed is the user in the program        DEFINER clause, not the invoking user. If that user has        table-level parent table privileges, parent table        information is still displayed. In this case, it is the        responsibility of the stored program creator to hide the        information by including appropriate condition handlers.        (Bug #19477611)  INFORMATION_SCHEMA Notes        * These new INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables are available as        views on data dictionary tables:            + VIEW_ROUTINE_USAGE provides information about stored             functions used in view definitions.            + VIEW_TABLE_USAGE provides information about tables             and views used in view definitions.        For more information, see The INFORMATION_SCHEMA        VIEW_ROUTINE_USAGE Table (http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/8.0\/en\/view-routine-usage-table.html),        and The INFORMATION_SCHEMA VIEW_TABLE_USAGE Table        (http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/8.0\/en\/view-table-usage-table.html).  Logging Notes        * Incompatible Change: The system variables have been        removed that previously configured error logging to the        system log (the Event Log on Windows, and syslog on Unix        and Unix-like systems). Where appropriate, the removed        system variables were replaced with new system variables        managed by the log_sink_syseventlog error log component.        The following table shows the old and new variable names.           Old System Variable    New System Variable        log_syslog_facility    syseventlog.facility        log_syslog_include_pid syseventlog.include_pid        log_syslog_tag         syseventlog.tag        log_syslog             None        Important        Installations that used the old system variable names        must update their configuration to use the new variable        names. For more information, see Error Logging to the        System Log        (http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/8.0\/en\/error-log-syslog.html).        References: See also: Bug #27534089.       * A new system variable, log_error_suppression_list,        enables specifying which diagnostics should not be        written to the error log when they occur with a severity        of WARNING or INFORMATION. For example, if a particular        type of warning occurs frequently but is not of interest        (and thus may be considered undesirable \"noise\" in the        error log), it now can be suppressed.       * The code to handle rewriting of account-management        statements was refactored to make it easier to maintain        and extend. This work resulted in a few minor        user-visible effects in the audit, general, and slow        query logs:            + Plaintext passwords are replaced by <string> rather             than '<string>'.            + Default clauses are not written unless specified by             the user.       * Previously, messages written to the error log by several        internal server methods were logged using the        ER_LOG_PRINTF_MSG error code. Each of these messages now        is logged using a unique error code.  Optimizer Notes        * The optimizer now supports a Skip Scan access method that        enables range access to be used in previously        inapplicable situations to improve query performance. For        more information, see Skip Scan Range Access Method (http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/8.0\/en\/range-optimization.html#range-access-skip-scan).        Thanks to Facebook for        the patch on which this access method is based. (Bug        #26976512, Bug #88103)       * MySQL now supports creation of functional index key parts        that index expression values rather than column values.        Functional key parts enable indexing of values that        cannot be indexed otherwise, such as JSON values. For        details, see CREATE INDEX Syntax        (http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/8.0\/en\/create-index.html).       * Performance of SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_name queries for        InnoDB tables was improved for single-threaded workloads        and when no extra clauses such as WHERE or GROUP BY are        used.  Packaging Notes        * Binary packages that include curl rather than linking to        the system curl library now use curl 7.60.0 rather than        7.45.0. (Bug #28043702)       * Debian packaging was updated to reflect the removal of        yaSSL and that OpenSSL is the default SSL library for all        builds. (Bug #28025599)       * Test plugins have been moved from server packages to test        packages. (Bug #27860172)       * MySQL Router is now included in the MySQL server source        and monolithic binary packages.  Performance Schema Notes        * A new Performance Schema stage, waiting for handler        commit, is available to detect threads going through        transaction commit. Thanks to Facebook for the patch.        (Bug #27855592, Bug #90417)  Security Notes        * Microsoft Windows: On Windows, MySQL Enterprise Edition        distributions now bundle the Cyrus SASL library files        libsasl.dll and saslSCRAM.dll so that the LDAP        authentication plugins can use the SCRAM-SHA-1        authentication method.       * MySQL Enterprise Edition now provides data masking and        de-identification capabilities, implemented as a plugin        library containing a plugin and a set of user-defined        functions. Data masking hides sensitive information by        replacing real values with substitutes. MySQL Enterprise        Data Masking and De-Identification functions enable        masking existing data using several methods such as        obfuscation (removing identifying characteristics),        generation of formatted random data, and data replacement        or substitution. For example: mysql> SET @ssn = gen_rnd_ssn(); mysql> SET @masked_ssn1 = mask_ssn(@ssn); mysql> SET @masked_ssn2 = mask_outer(mask_inner (@ssn,4,5,'A'), 3,0,'B '); mysql> SELECT @ssn, @masked_ssn1, @masked_ssn2; +-------------+--------------+--------------+ | @ssn        | @masked_ssn1 | @masked_ssn2 | +-------------+--------------+--------------+ | 980-31-2838 | XXX-XX-2838  | BBB-AA-2838  | +-------------+--------------+--------------+         For more information, see MySQL Enterprise Data Masking        and De-Identification        (http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/8.0\/en\/data-masking.html).  Spatial Data Support        * Incompatible Change: Previously, ST_Area() supported only        geometry arguments having a Cartesian spatial reference        system (SRS) and produced an error when invoked with        geometry arguments that specified a geographic SRS.        ST_Area() now supports geometry arguments having a        geographic SRS and returns the geodetic area in square        meters.        Note        If spatial data contains geometry values that now are        interpreted differently by ST_Area(), existing queries        using this function will return different results,        compared to previous MySQL versions.       * The parser for spatial reference system (SRS) definitions        in CREATE SPATIAL REFERENCE SYSTEM statements now is        stricter about rejecting invalid constructs, and requires        an axis clause in geographic SRS definitions. (Bug        #28186073, Bug #28147723)       * Previously, ST_Validate() supported only geometry        arguments having a Cartesian spatial reference system        (SRS) and produced an error when invoked with geometry        arguments that specified a geographic SRS. ST_Validate()        now supports geometry arguments having a geographic SRS.        Note        If spatial data contains geometry values that now are        interpreted differently by ST_Validate(), existing        queries using this function will return different        results, compared to previous MySQL versions.       * MySQL now implements the ST_Transform() spatial function        for use in converting geometry values from one spatial        reference system (SRS) to another. Currently, it supports        conversion between geographic SRSs. For details, see        Spatial Operator Functions        (http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/8.0\/en\/spatial-operator-functions.html).  SQL Syntax Notes        * Incompatible Change: The deprecated ASC or DESC        qualifiers for GROUP BY clauses have been removed.        Queries that previously relied on GROUP BY sorting may        produce results that differ from previous MySQL versions.        To produce a given sort order, provide an ORDER BY        clause.        Queries and stored program definitions from MySQL 8.0.12        or lower that use ASC or DESC qualifiers for GROUP BY        clauses should be amended. Otherwise, upgrading to MySQL        8.0.13 or higher may fail, as may replicating to MySQL        8.0.13 or higher slave servers.  XA Transaction Notes        * Previously, metadata locks for XA transactions in        PREPARED state could be dropped when the client        performing the transaction disconnected or the server        restarted. This could lead to behavior such as one        session being able to drop tables used by an XA        transaction in progress for another session. Metadata        locks for XA transactions in PREPARED state now are        maintained across client disconnects and server restarts,        until an XA COMMIT or XA ROLLBACK is executed. (Bug        #22710164, Bug #79940)  X Plugin Notes        * Important Change: X Protocol now provides a connection        pooling option, which can reduce overhead for        applications that open many connections to MySQL server        such as small web pages or a REST API endpoint. Use the        new mysqlx.getClient(connection, options) operation,        which returns a Client object. By using a Client object,        executing an open session operation retrieves an existing        and currently unused network connection from the pool,        resets it, and uses it. Closing a session marks the        underlying connection as unused and returns it to the        Client object's connection pool. The connection pool is        configured using a options data dictionary, which means        that a deployed application can switch from using        connection pooling or not by simply changing the        connection string.       * A mutex lock has been added to prevent conflict between        multiple X Plugin client sessions when a large number of        sessions are being opened and closed. (Bug #28637947)       * When an X Plugin client attempted to connect to a MySQL        server specifying a database that did not exist on the        server, the error message indicated that access was        denied rather than that the database was not known. The        correct error message is now returned. (Bug #28110957)       * Incorrect copying of an integer value by X Plugin caused        an error relating to misaligned memory access. The issue        is now fixed. (Bug #28070946, Bug #90983)       * Now that X Plugin is loaded and enabled by default, the        default verbosity setting for the error log meant that no        message was visible to indicate that X Plugin was        available on the MySQL server. A message is now issued        during system startup to confirm that X Plugin has been        loaded. (Bug #27287340)       * X Protocol now provides the ability to broadcast        information to interested clients without the requirement        to request the information. In addition, changes related        to Group Replication are also broadcast. As part of this        work the Mysqlx_notified_by_group_replication and        Mysqlx_notice_global_sent status variables have been        added.  Functionality Added or Changed        * Important Change; NDB Cluster; NDB Client Programs:        Removed the deprecated --ndb option for perror. Use        ndb_perror to obtain error message information from NDB        error codes instead. (Bug #81705, Bug #23523957)        References: See also: Bug #81704, Bug #23523926.       * Important Change: Setting user variables in statements        other than SET is now deprecated due to issues that        included those listed here:            + The order of evaluation for expressions involving             user variables was undefined.            + The default result type of a variable is based on             its type at the beginning of the statement, which             could have unintended effects when a variable             holding a value of one type at the beginning of a             statement was assigned a new value of a different             type in the same statement.            + HAVING, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY clauses, when             referring to a variable that was assigned a value in             the select expression list, did not work as expected             because the expression was evaluated on the client             and so it was possible for stale column values from             a previous row to be used.        Syntax such as SELECT @var, @var:=@var+1 is still        accepted in MySQL 8.0 for backward compatibility, but is        subject to removal in a future release.       * InnoDB: The innodb_fsync_threshold system variable        permits a threshold size to be defined for the write        buffer. By default, when InnoDB creates a new data file,        such as a new log file or tablespace file, it flushes the        contents of the write buffer to disk only after a file is        fully written, which can cause a surge in disk write        activity. The innodb_fsync_threshold system variable can        be used to force smaller, periodic flushes to help avoid        such surges in disk write activity. (Bug #27724600)       * InnoDB: User-created temporary tables and internal        temporary tables created by the optimizer are now stored        in session temporary tablespaces that are allocated to a        session from a pool of temporary tablespaces. When a        session disconnects, its temporary tablespaces are        truncated and released back to the pool. In previous        releases, temporary tables were created in the global        temporary tablespace (ibtmp1), which did not return disk        space to the operating system after temporary tables were        dropped.        The innodb_temp_tablespaces_dir variable defines the        location where session temporary tablespaces are created.        The default location is the #innodb_temp directory in the        data directory.        The INNODB_SESSION_TEMP_TABLESPACES table provides        metadata about session temporary tablespaces.        The global temporary tablespace (ibtmp1) now stores        rollback segments for changes made to user-created        temporary tables.       * InnoDB: The InnoDB tablespace encryption feature now        supports general tablespaces. Previously, only        file-per-table tablespaces could be encrypted. To support        encryption of general tablespaces, CREATE TABLESPACE and        ALTER TABLESPACE syntax was extended to include an        ENCRYPTION clause.        The INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_TABLESPACES table now        includes an ENCRYPTION column that indicates whether or        not a tablespace is encrypted.        The stage\/innodb\/alter tablespace (encryption)        Performance Schema stage instrument was added to permit        monitoring of general tablespace encryption operations.       * Replication: You can now make changes to the        configuration of a group while it is running, without        having to stop all members to make changes. This        functionality relies on UDFs which are installed with        this version of the plugin, and all members of a group        must have these UDFs installed. To use the UDFs, connect        to an online member and issue SELECT UDF;        Use the group_replication_set_as_primary() UDF to trigger        the election of a specific member as the new primary in a        single-primary group, overriding the usual election        process. See Changing a Group's Primary Member (http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/8.0\/en\/group-replication-changing-primary-member.html)        for more information.        In addition, you can configure the mode which a group is        using while it is online, changing between single-primary        mode and multi-primary mode. To change the mode of an        online group, choose one of these options:            + Use             group_replication_switch_to_single_primary_mode() to             change a group running in multi-primary mode to             single-primary mode.            + Use group_replication_switch_to_multi_primary_mode()             to to change a group running in single-primary mode             to multi-primary mode.        See Changing a Group's Mode (http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/8.0\/en\/group-replication-changing-group-mode.html)        for more information.       * Replication: You can now inspect and configure the        maximum number of consensus instances at any time for a        group. This maximum is referred to as the event horizon        for a group, and is the maximum number of consensus        instances that the system can execute in parallel. This        enables you to fine tune the performance of your Group        Replication deployment.        To inspect a group's event horizon value at runtime,        issue: SELECT group_replication_get_write_concurrency()         To set the maximum number of write consensus instances,        issue: SELECT group_replication_set_write_concurrency(instances);         where instances is the new number of maximum instances        used for consensus.        See Using Group Replication Group Write Consensus (http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/8.0\/en\/group-replication-group-write-consensus.html)        for more information.       * Solaris: On Solaris, MySQL can now be built with        Developer Studio 12.6. (Bug #27055190, Bug #88316, Bug        #28165246, Bug #91214)       * Data truncation testing was rewritten to avoid undefined        behavior. (Bug #28255956, Bug #91445)       * Out-of-range checking for float values was improved. (Bug        #28225635)       * The upgrade check that the server runs during the startup        process now verifies that partitioned InnoDB tables do        not use shared tablespaces. (Bug #28204431)       * Previously, file I\/O performed in the I\/O cache in the        mysys library was not instrumented, affecting in        particular file I\/O statistics reported by the        Performance Schema about the binary log index file. Now,        this I\/O is instrumented and Performance Schema        statistics are accurate. Thanks to Yura Sorokin for the        contribution. (Bug #27788907, Bug #90264)       * Performance for locating user account entries in the        in-memory privilege structures has been improved. Thanks        to Eric Herman for the contribution. (Bug #27772506, Bug        #90244)       * If mysqld --initialize fails to complete but creates an        unusable data directory, it now displays a message that        the data directory is unusable and can safely be removed.        (Bug #27675647)       * Instrumentation is now provided in the Performance Schema        for transaction retries by individual applier threads on        a single-threaded or multithreaded slave. Previously, the        Performance Schema table        replication_applier_status_by_worker displayed        information about errors that stopped the applier thread,        but not about transient errors that occurred before a        transaction was eventually applied. With this        information, you can identify transient errors that are        causing replication lag on replication slaves or Group        Replication group members.        Eight new columns have been added to the Performance        Schema replication_applier_status_by_worker table:            + LAST_APPLIED_TRANSACTION_RETRIES_COUNT - The number             of times the last applied transaction was retried by             the worker after the first attempt. If the             transaction was applied at the first attempt, this             number is zero.            + LAST_APPLIED_TRANSACTION_LAST_TRANSIENT_ERROR_NUMBER             - The error number of the last transient error that             caused the transaction to be retried.            + LAST_APPLIED_TRANSACTION_LAST_TRANSIENT_ERROR_MESSAG             E - The message text for the last transient error             that caused the transaction to be retried.            + LAST_APPLIED_TRANSACTION_LAST_TRANSIENT_ERROR_TIMEST             AMP - The timestamp in 'YYYY-MM-DD             HH:MM:SS[.fraction]' format for the last transient             error that caused the transaction to be retried.            + APPLYING_TRANSACTION_RETRIES_COUNT - The number of             times the transaction that is currently being             applied was retried until this moment. If the             transaction was applied at the first attempt, this             number is zero.            + APPLYING_TRANSACTION_LAST_TRANSIENT_ERROR_NUMBER -             The error number of the last transient error that             caused the current transaction to be retried.            + APPLYING_TRANSACTION_LAST_TRANSIENT_ERROR_MESSAGE -             The message text for the last transient error that             caused the current transaction to be retried.            + APPLYING_TRANSACTION_LAST_TRANSIENT_ERROR_TIMESTAMP             - The timestamp in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS[.fraction]'             format for the last transient error that caused the             current transaction to be retried.        The existing column        APPLYING_TRANSACTION_START_APPLY_TIMESTAMP is no longer        reset each time a transaction is retried. It now retains        the timestamp from the worker's first attempt to apply        the transaction.       * Previously, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE and DROP TEMPORARY        TABLE statements were not supported inside transactions,        procedures, functions, or triggers when using GTIDs (that        is, when the enforce_gtid_consistency system variable is        set to ON). It was possible to use these statements with        GTIDs enabled, but only outside of any transaction, and        only with autocommit=1.        From MySQL 8.0.13, this restriction has been removed when        binlog_format is set to ROW or MIXED. With row-based        logging in use, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE and DROP TEMPORARY        TABLE statements can now be used inside transactions,        procedures, functions, or triggers when GTIDs are        enabled. When binlog_format is set to STATEMENT, the        restriction remains. Because of this difference in        behavior, some additional restrictions now apply to        changing the binlog_format setting at runtime:            + If a session has open temporary tables, the             replication format cannot be changed for the session             (SET @@session.binlog_format).            + If any replication channel has open temporary             tables, the replication format cannot be changed             globally (SET @@global.binlog_format or SET             @@persist.binlog_format).            + If any replication channel applier thread is             currently running, the replication format cannot be             changed globally (SET @@global.binlog_format or SET             @@persist.binlog_format).        Trying to switch the replication format in any of these        cases (or attempting to set the current replication        format) results in an error. You can, however, use        PERSIST_ONLY (SET @@persist_only.binlog_format) to change        the replication format at any time, because this action        does not modify the runtime global system variable value,        and takes effect only after a server restart.        When binlog_format is set to ROW or MIXED, CREATE        TEMPORARY TABLE and DROP TEMPORARY TABLE statements are        not written to the binary log and are therefore not        replicated to slaves. When they are used in transactions,        if the removal of these statements from the transaction        results in an empty transaction, the transaction is not        written to the binary log. If a transaction involving        these statements is rolled back, a warning message is        issued stating that the creation or dropping of the        temporary tables could not be rolled back.       * The MySQL Server code for binary logging has been        refactored to create new internal interfaces for        accessing events in a binary log and relay log. The new        interfaces separate the write and read processes for        binary logging into input and output streams, and        decouple the process of capturing and retrieving binary        log events from the process of writing them to files. A        logical binary log file is used to wrapper the storage        layer operations.        The new internal interfaces make it possible for MySQL        Server to use alternative storage methods for binary log        events besides a standard binary log or relay log file,        including a binary log cache or memory buffer. For        example, Group Replication uses the new interfaces to        serialize events directly to memory buffers and        transaction messages in order to co-ordinate transactions        in the group. mysqlbinlog also now uses them to read        binary log events from standard input.        The following existing error messages are now marked as        obsolete due to the new internal interfaces:            + ER_BINLOG_CANT_OPEN_LOG            + ER_BINLOG_CANT_CREATE_CACHE_FOR_LOG            + ER_BINLOG_ERROR_GETTING_NEXT_LOG_FROM_INDEX            + ER_RPL_RECOVERY_ERROR_FREEING_IO_CACHE            + ER_GRP_RPL_REINIT_OF_INTERNAL_CACHE_FOR_READ_FAILED            + ER_GRP_RPL_APPENDING_DATA_TO_INTERNAL_CACHE_FAILED            + ER_GRP_RPL_REINIT_OF_INTERNAL_CACHE_FOR_WRITE_FAILED            + ER_GRP_RPL_FAILED_TO_CREATE_COMMIT_CACHE            + ER_GRP_RPL_REINIT_OF_COMMIT_CACHE_FOR_WRITE_FAILED       * The TempTable storage engine now supports storage of        binary large object (BLOB) type columns. This enhancement        improves performance for queries that use temporary        tables containing BLOB data. Previously, temporary tables        that contained BLOB data were stored in the on-disk        storage engine defined by        internal_tmp_disk_storage_engine.       * The MySQL Server code for deserialization of binary log        events has been refactored to improve the identification        and resilient handling of corrupted and invalid event        data during replication, and also during processing with        mysqlbinlog, whether or not binary log checksums are used        on the server.       * Previously, executing RENAME TABLE required that there be        no tables locked with LOCK TABLES. Now it is possible to        rename tables that are locked with a WRITE lock or that        are the product of renaming WRITE-locked tables from        earlier steps in a multiple-table rename operation.       * The group_replication_member_expel_timeout option has        been added to define the time period that the group        should wait for a non-responding member before evicting        the member from the group. This enables you to configure        the eviction process when the connection to members is        unreliable. "}

{"text":"MySQL Connector\/NET 8.0.20 has been released (no replies)   Dear MySQL users,  MySQL Connector\/NET 8.0.20 is the latest General Availability release of the MySQL Connector\/NET 8.0 series. This version supports .NET Core 3.1 and the X DevAPI, which enables application developers to write code that combines the strengths of the relational and document models using a modern, NoSQL-like syntax that does not assume previous experience writing traditional SQL.  To learn more about how to write applications using the X DevAPI, see http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/x-devapi-userguide\/en\/index.html. For more information about how the X DevAPI is implemented in Connector\/NET, see http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/dev\/connector-net. NuGet packages provide functionality at a project level. To get the full set of features available in Connector\/NET such as availability in the GAC, integration with Visual Studio's Entity Framework Designer and integration with MySQL for Visual Studio, installation through the MySQL Installer or the stand-alone MSI is required.  Please note that the X DevAPI requires at least MySQL Server version 8.0 or higher with the X Plugin enabled. For general documentation about how to get started using MySQL as a document store, see http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/8.0\/en\/document-store.html.  To download MySQL Connector\/NET 8.0.20, see http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/downloads\/connector\/net\/  Installation instructions can be found at https:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/connector-net\/en\/connector-net-installation.html  Changes in MySQL Connector\/NET 8.0.20 (2020-04-27, General Availability)      * Functionality Added or Changed      * Bugs Fixed  Functionality Added or Changed      * Connector\/NET now supports Entity Framework Core 3.1.1 on       all platforms with NET Standard 2.0 support. Microsoft       Entity Framework Core 3.1.1 is not compatible with the       previous versions of EF Core and those previous versions       (2.1, 2.0, 1.1) are not supported by this release of       Connector\/NET (see Entity Framework Core Support ( https:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/connector-net\/en\/connector-net-entityframework-core.html )).       In addition, the MySql.Data.EntityFrameworkCore.Design       NuGet package is deprecated and the functionality       provided by that package now is merged with the       MySql.Data.EntityFrameworkCore package.      * Connector\/NET now provides compression of X Protocol       payload data, which can be configured using the new       Compression connection option. The option is set to       preferred mode by default to compress the payload data if       the MySQL server instance also supports compression. For       a description of each option value, see Options for X       Protocol Only ( https:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/connector-net\/en\/connector-net-8-0-connection-options.html#connector-net-8-0-connection-options-xprotocol ).      * Document Store: Connector\/NET now provides JSON schema       validation for a collection to enforce a certain       structure that documents must adhere to before they are       permitted to be inserted or updated. Schema validation is       performed by the server, which returns an error message       if a document in a collection does not match the schema       definition or if the server does not support validation.       The existing Schema.CreateCollection method now is       overloaded and can be used to pass a       CreateCollectionOptions object with a schema definition       to a MySQL server. The ReuseExistingObject parameter of       the original method is set as an option within       CreateCollectionOptions when using the new overloaded       method. The level of enforcement (off or strict, strict       by default) and schema definition are specified using the       validation option, for example: var collOptions = CreateCollectionOptions() {     reuseExistingObject = false,     validation = Validation() {         level = ValidationLevel.Strict,         schema = \"{\\\"id\\\": \\\"http:\/\/json-schema.org\/geo\\\",\"                         + \"\\\"$schema\\\": \\\"http:\/\/json-schema.org\/draft-06\/schema# \\\",\"                         +               \" \\\"description\\\": \\\"A geographical coordinate\\\", \"                         +               \" \\\"type\\\": \\\"object\\\",\"                         +               \" \\\"properties\\\": {\"                         +                    \" \\\"latitude\\\": {\"                         +                         \" \\\"type\\\": \\\"number\\\"\"                         +                    \" },\"                         +                      \" \\\"longitude\\\": {\"                         +                          \" \\\"type\\\": \\\"number\\\"\"                         +                     \" }\"                         +                \" },\"                         +                \" \\\"required\\\": [\\\"latitude\\\", \\\"longitude\\\"]\"                         +  \" }\"              } };  var coll = schema.CreateCollection(\"longlang\", collOptions);             In addition, a new method permits the schema validation             of an existing collection to be reset. The             Schema.ModifyCollection method passes a             ModifyCollectionOptions object to the server. The             validation collection option must include either a              modified level value or schema value (or both), for             example: var collOptions = ModifyCollectionOptions() {     validation = Validation() {         level = ValidationLevel.Off             } };  var coll = schema.ModifyCollection(\"longlang\", collOptions);            The ReuseExistingObject option is not supported for            modifications and returns an error message if it is used.  Bugs Fixed      * A connection made to a named server with multiple DNS       entries pointing to different IP addresses for the same       server generated an exception. Now, only the first       element is returned when multiple elements are found.       (Bug #30970949, Bug #97448)      * The MySQL.Data NuGet package for Connector\/NET 8.0.19       included an unsigned version of Ubiety.Dns.Core.dll,       which produced an exception when loaded. (Bug #30798305,       Bug #98204)      * Scaffolding a MySQL database with EF Core 3.0 was not       implemented by Connector\/NET and the connector returned       an exception in response to its use. Support for EF Core       3.1.1 in this release adds scaffolding capabilities. (Bug       #30677382, Bug #98011)      * The get_info method was not included in any of the Entity       Framework Core versions (1.1, 2.0, and 2.1) that       Connector\/NET supported. Connector\/NET now supports EF       Core 3.1.1 and implements the       MySql.Data.EntityFrameworkCore.Infrastructure.MySQLOption       sExtension.Internal.get_info method. (Bug #30347893, Bug       #96990)      * The MySqlDbType.JSON type when used as a parameter in a       prepared statement produced code errors. Connector\/NET       now interprets MySqlDbType.JSON as MySqlDbType.VarChar.       No code changes are required to specify a JSON column.       (Bug #29959124, Bug #95984)      * Blank spaces mixed with values in the IN() list of a       SELECT statement generated an error. (Bug #29838254)      * An attempt to read the record of a model class defined to       correspond to a MySQL table with a property of type bool?       (nullable Boolean), using the EF Core database context,       returned an error message. (Bug #29833103, Bug #93028)      * Access to the MySqlDataReader object was restricted when       the parent MySqlCommand object was closed. This fix       modifies MySqlCommand.Dispose() to no longer call the       ResetReader method. (Bug #27441433, Bug #89159)  On Behalf of MySQL Release Engineering Team, Tvarita Jain "}

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.

Description The remote NewStart CGSL host, running version CORE 5.05 \/ MAIN 5.05, has http-parser packages installed that are affected by multiple vulnerabilities:  - The HTTP parser in all current versions of Node.js     ignores spaces in the `Content-Length` header, allowing     input such as `Content-Length: 1 2` to be interpreted as     having a value of `12`. The HTTP specification does not     allow for spaces in the `Content-Length` value and the     Node.js HTTP parser has been brought into line on this     particular difference. The security risk of this flaw to     Node.js users is considered to be VERY LOW as it is     difficult, and may be impossible, to craft an attack     that makes use of this flaw in a way that could not     already be achieved by supplying an incorrect value for     `Content-Length`. Vulnerabilities may exist in user-code     that make incorrect assumptions about the potential     accuracy of this value compared to the actual length of     the data supplied. Node.js users crafting lower-level     HTTP utilities are advised to re-check the length of any     input supplied after parsing is complete.    (CVE-2018-7159)  - Node.js: All versions prior to Node.js 6.15.0, 8.14.0,     10.14.0 and 11.3.0: Denial of Service with large HTTP     headers: By using a combination of many requests with     maximum sized headers (almost 80 KB per connection), and     carefully timed completion of the headers, it is     possible to cause the HTTP server to abort from heap     allocation failure. Attack potential is mitigated by the     use of a load balancer or other proxy layer.    (CVE-2018-12121)Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number. Solution Upgrade the vulnerable CGSL http-parser packages. Note that updated packages may not be available yet. Please contact ZTE for more information.

{"text":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in dojo (npm) with medium severity https:\/\/snyk.io\/vuln\/SNYK-JS-DOJO-174934          Severity: medium Affects: dojo Overview dojo is a foundation package for the Dojo 1 Toolkit. While still being maintained, new development is primarily focused on modern Dojo. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Dojo allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors, possibly related to:   dojo\/resources\/iframe_history.html 'dojox\/av\/FLAudio.js, dojox\/av\/FLVideo.js, dojox\/av\/resources\/audio.swf'  'dojox\/av\/resources\/video.swf, util\/buildscripts\/jslib\/build.js'  'util\/buildscripts\/jslib\/buildUtil.js'   as demonstrated by the (1) dojoUrl and (2) testUrl parameters to util\/doh\/runner.html. Description A cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source. This is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser\u2019s Same Origin Policy. \u05bfInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability. Escaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, < can be coded as  &lt; and > can be coded as &gt; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses < and > as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they\u2019ve been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted. The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.  Types of attacks There are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:    Type Origin Description    Stored Server The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.   Reflected Server The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user\u2019s browser.   DOM-based Client The attacker forces the user\u2019s browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.   Mutated  The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.   Affected environments The following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:  Web servers Application servers Web application environments  How to prevent This section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code:   Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches.  Convert special characters such as ?, &, \/, <, > and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.  Give users the option to disable client-side scripts. Redirect invalid requests. Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions. Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack. Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.  Remediation Upgrade dojo to version 1.0.3, 1.1.2, 1.2.4, 1.3.3, 1.4.2 or higher. References  Dojo Bug Tracker  Exploit Example   "}

{"text":"GitLab deploys into multiple clouds from kubectl using Crossplane Today the Crossplane community is demonstrating how GitLab is the first real-world application deployed across multiple clouds via Crossplane, the open source multicloud control plane. When Crossplane launched, we were excited to learn about a project that is taking the complexity out of managing services across multiple clouds. We believe this is the last hurdle to multicloud maturity. As some of our competitors move closer to supporting one cloud, GitLab is committed to multicloud DevOps. Today, our customers already can install and deploy from GitLab to any public cloud. In the future and as the Crossplane project matures, we plan to leverage Crossplane to help our customers take multicloud one step further to deploy GitLab entirely through the Kubernetes API into multiple clouds,  including the use of fully-managed services offered by the respective cloud providers. Deploy GitLab with external managed services using kubectl Real-world applications like GitLab can now be deployed entirely from kubectl into multiple clouds using Crossplane, including their external managed services. Crossplane extends the Kubernetes API by adding resource claims and resource classes to support composability of managed service dependencies in Kubernetes, similar to persistent volume claims and storage classes. Crossplane is easily added to any existing Kubernetes cluster and cleanly layers on top of clusters provisioned by Anthos, EKS, AKS, and OpenShift. Cluster administrators install Crossplane on a Kubernetes cluster, set cloud credentials, and specify which managed services they want to make available for self-service provisioning within the cluster. Policies guide binding to specific managed service offerings configured by the cluster administrator. Application owners can consume and compose these managed services on-demand with the Kubernetes patterns they\u2019re familiar with today, without having to know about the infrastructure details or having to manage credentials. This provides an excellent separation of concerns and makes applications more portable, while retaining flexibility for cluster administrators to tailor how they want these managed services to be provisioned in their environments. For production deployments, GitLab recommends using external managed services for Redis, PostgreSQL, and object storage. Crossplane supports declaring these managed services as resource claims in Kubernetes that dynamically bind to the appropriate cloud provider using resource classes configured by the cluster administrator to provide the managed service. Deploy GitLab to multiple clouds using Crossplane with the following steps: Cluster Administrator:  Install Crossplane on your Kubernetes cluster Set cloud provider credentials Provide managed services with resource classes  Application Owner:  Provision managed services with resource claims Bind resource claims into the exported GitLab Helm chart Deploy the GitLab application with Crossplane managed services  That's it! GitLab is now up and running in your cloud of choice, using fully-managed services for Redis, PostgreSQL, and storage buckets! Please see the Crossplane blog post to learn more about deploying GitLab to multiple clouds with external managed service dependencies, including the full instructions so you can follow along in your own environment. Multicloud success in the enterprise With 81 percent of enterprises already adopting a multicloud strategy, technologies like Crossplane are key to enterprise adoption success. While the ability to choose any cloud to run on is important, the practicalities of developing and deploying applications in multiple clouds is complex, driving up development costs. Crossplane introduces a set of workload resource abstractions on top of existing managed services and cloud offerings to enable workload portability across cloud providers. This allows developers to produce complex applications that can be deployed anywhere, while enabling operational teams to manage cloud infrastructure by policy and business priorities. \u201cWe\u2019re showing a real-world example of the future of multicloud today,\u201d said Bassam Tabbara, CEO of Upbound and maintainer on Crossplane. \u201cGitLab is a production application that relies on multiple fully-managed services, so by abstracting these services and integrating them with the declarative Kubernetes API, we are demonstrating the ability to standardize on a single declarative API to manage it all.\u201d Find us at KubeCon Barcelona this week GitLab will be at KubeCon Barcelona this week and we would love to meet you to talk to you about how GitLab can help you with your Multicloud strategy. Join us at the Multicloud 360 event at KubeCon on Tuesday, from 8:30 pm to midnight, alongside Upbound, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean and CockroachDB. RSVP here to claim your spot.  In addition visit GitLab at the KubeCon Booth, S21, to learn more about GitLab and Kubernetes and be sure to check out everything else we are involved in here. "}

{"text":"Zero Trust at GitLab: Where do we go from here? Zero Trust is the practice of shifting access control from the network perimeter to the assets, individuals, and the respective endpoints. For GitLab, Zero Trust means that all users and devices trying to access an endpoint or asset within our GitLab environment will need to authenticate and be authorized. This is part 6 of 6 in our series.  Part one: The evolution of Zero Trust Part two: Zero Trust at GitLab: Problems, goals, and coming challenges Part three: Zero Trust at GitLab: The data classification and infrastructure challenge Part four: Zero Trust at GitLab: Mitigating challenges with data zones and authentication scoring Part five: Zero Trust at GitLab: Implementation challenges  We've talked pretty openly about forming our ZTN approach and the challenges we expect along the way \u2013 as well as the challenges we've already met. If there is an area of ZTN that we've not addressed, or if you're interested in diving deeper into the topic, we invite you to join us October 29, 3-4 pm ET for our Zero Trust Reddit AMA where you can Ask Us Anything!  Have an area of ZTN that you'd like to discuss further? Join our October 29 (3-4 pm ET) reddit AMA on Zero Trust and ask us anything! Where we are I guess it makes sense to talk about where we are at with this whole ZTN thing. In addition to establishing policies for team members (based upon job descriptions and placement in the org chart), we have classified our data and mapped out our environment so we know where all of the parts are. But there are a few items we want to explain with a bit of detail. Getting SaaS       GitLab Commit San Francisco   Join our user conference on January 14!   Register now      Using Okta, we have managed to get (as of this writing) 70 of our SaaS apps under some semblance of control. This \u201ccontrol\u201d has varied heavily \u2013 some SaaS apps cleanly and seamlessly integrated with Okta, and some were working kinda-sorta-good-enough to call them integrated. The majority of SaaS integrations work fine as they used SAML and easily integrate in minutes. We can provision and deprovision accounts with simple assignments. Departments like People Ops can do provisioning within minutes instead of days. For some of the integrations, we can force the user to go through Okta, and in a few cases where we have sensitive data, we have extra security steps. For example, to access BambooHR users have to go through Okta first (and using Multi-Factor Authentication aka MFA) instead of direct access, and they have to perform yet one more MFA-style step of authentication just for BambooHR. Are there problems with this? Sure. Not everything integrates as well as Greenhouse or BambooHR, because each SaaS has implemented their own APIs and done their own SAML setup. Some don\u2019t offer consistent interfaces to integrate with, which means that our team members can bypass Okta and go straight into the SaaS app in some cases, and in others they are forced to use Okta. This workflow inconsistency is sometimes frustrating for team members. We\u2019re constantly updating our team member instructions on Okta usage and try to communicate it to all team members as best we can, but we are impacting some users\u2019 workflows. For example, if you sign in via Okta, you need to keep that tab open in your browser, otherwise your Okta session will end and you\u2019ll find yourself repeatedly \u201cMFAing\u201d until you\u2019re blue in the face. Many people are not used to working that way, and not having all SaaS apps working exactly the same doesn\u2019t help. But overall, the time savings and security are great gains for ZTN and we are quite happy with the implementation. SSH access As I write this, we are getting ready to start the Okta ASA rollout to Staging to give it a good test. Like SaaS, we expect a few hiccups here and there \u2013 especially since this is a new product for Okta, released earlier this year. And talk about workflow changes \u2013 if you thought browser-based application users were picky, command line SSH users are a bizarre bunch indeed. Command line junkies practically have their own religion around workflow and we\u2019re introducing a change to that workflow. Yes, it is a minor change, but it already concerns me. Truthfully, because I am one of those oddball Linux users who lives on the command line and I tend to get fairly picky after a couple decades of being able to adjust and customize every aspect of my experience. Camo proxy This will seem like a weird one, but mitigating a security issue actually helped us out from a ZTN perspective. There was a security issue reported via our HackerOne program that allowed for malicious users to gather IP addresses from unsuspecting victims via embedded image files. The solution was to use Camo proxy to resolve the issue. The Camo proxy was widely deployed to ensure all possible links were protected and had the side benefit of ensuring communications going through the proxy were encrypted. Encrypting communications was one of the items we wanted as a part of ZTN and, as it turned out, we\u2019d already done it. A sound foundation There are two things we want from our servers and containers and databases. First, we want them buttoned down tight and properly secured. All of these systems have robust controls, and we can perform all kinds of monitoring, but we have to do it at scale. Tightening security controls is especially important if you are using some of the Zero Trust-ish solutions out there to regulate access to these systems. We\u2019re talking about automation of access provisioning, so we want to make sure that minimal access levels required for data stored on systems remains minimal access. This means no escalation of privileges due to configuration mistakes or security vulnerabilities. We also want to make sure that all services being offered up by these systems are as secure as possible against compromise, either locally or remotely. Second, we want complete visibility into our infrastructure. If something goes awry with a vulnerability being disclosed that potentially impacts our systems or a security incident happens, we want to be able to quickly assess the state of the environment, ensure patches are installed, receive alerts based upon custom triggers to help monitor everything, and so on. We are using Tenable (mainly for assessments) and Uptycs (mainly for monitoring and alerting) in our environment to help with this visibility. Both certainly handle the basics just fine, in fact Tenable has been quite up to the task. We are facing a few challenges with Uptycs as we\u2019d like to do more than what the product currently offers. This may not sound like traditional ZTN territory, but it is. It does no good to offer up state-of-the-art authentication and authorization to resources that are poorly maintained and monitored. Like everything else in our company, we face issues with scale \u2013 our infrastructure needs to grow and managing the security of that infrastructure must also scale well. Right now we can manage the security of our environment just fine. In fact, it is quite strong, but a lot of it relies on manual intervention which has scaling issues. We have a lot of hash marks in the \u201cwin\u201d column with Tenable, but as we scale and expand we\u2019re challenged by Uptycs. In the spirit of openness, we\u2019ll keep you posted on how this progresses. The log ride To get a grip on all of this activity, we need to be able to grab all the logs, toss them into one place, and make sense out of them. Our goal is two-fold: we need to understand how our system is being used so we can fine-tune it and we need to be able to detect anomalous events that could signify potential breaches. All of our systems put out logs, and we\u2019ve designed systems to monitor those logs. It is nice to automate alerts so as odd events occur, we\u2019re immediately notified, and in some cases, issues are automatically opened for further triage. We\u2019ve started down this path with deployment of several technologies, related to the Logging Working Group. We\u2019re in the initial first steps, and we expect that logs generated from the various ZTN implementations will help improve the logging efforts, perhaps even propel it along quicker as we work out the kinks. The Budget Issue A big ZTN question we get involves budget. After all, one company\u2019s solution may involve a couple of small purchases and a large effort of tweaking and reconfiguring existing technology that is already deployed. Another company might have to make some major investments in new products just to get started. In other words, how do you budget for a solution when you don\u2019t know exactly what that solution will look like? This is probably one of those things a lot of organizations do not discuss, at least in any detail outside of \u201cit\u2019s expensive\u201d. The idea of ZTN as a concept is an easy sell to most organizations because the benefits are so great. At the lofty bullet-point level on vendor slides, they often seem completely undeniable. But when you break down a concept into digestible and deployable components, you are often into interesting budget territory. Getting a department to buy into the concept is much easier than getting a department to alter their budget and purchase the XYZ product, deploy it, maintain it, and oh yeah please give the security department all of the logs. Of course this is a slight exaggeration to convey a point, but it is more often on the mark than not. We simply couldn\u2019t fully budget for most of this because we didn\u2019t know what we were going to be deploying until we found a particular solution. In this case we have to be able to show an ROI, which means we need to help a department understand the benefits and actually show an improvement to that department\u2019s bottom line. For example, Okta has allowed us to change some onboarding and offboarding processes from days into minutes \u2013 and it's a massive timesaver. The push for Okta ASA is because our Infrastructure department saw the gains realized from our Okta rollout, and asked for something similar. Regardless of which department\u2019s budget this could go against, it has to be sold to someone internally. Showing an ROI that clearly states we could financially benefit in one or more areas is really the only way to go about it. Showing the benefits is critical when you are searching for solutions to problems with no idea which solution will work. Advice Since a lot of people ask for advice on ZTN in general, I\u2019d like to share some impressions from our experience. Here are some major things that really have helped us. Break down your needs into simple components You do this by defining the problem end-to-end. For us, we could break it down into user identification and authentication, device identification and authorization, data classification, and policy enforcement. Each part was further broken down into smaller pieces \u2013 which includes a lot of what we covered in previous blog posts. This deconstruction helped us understand all of the areas we needed to work with. Look at areas of winning If a deployed technology is already solving part of the problem, can it be expanded? If it can\u2019t, why not? Where are the gaps? List those gaps and use them to identify possible solutions during the review. We covered this topic in detail in a previous blog post, ZTN implementation challenges . Ignore the vendor \u201cspin\u201d There are vendors that sell solutions where they claim to be solving ZTN. In my ancient past, I worked for a company that sold (among other things) system administration tools. One day our boss handed us a list of compliance guidelines for three different standards. We were to go through each bullet item for each standard, point out the system administrative tools and the various system checks in our products that lined up with each bullet item, and write them down. This process took a few days, and by the end of the week each compliance standard had a list of checks. The product team grouped these checks together, and just like that we were a compliance company. Now the product line was actually quite good and robust which made this fairly easily, but the pivot of the company to being compliance-focused took longer for that marketing team to print up flyers than it did for the tech part. Yes, we were incomplete \u2013 we weren\u2019t asked to write additional checks, we were asked to just use existing checks. But we literally were ready in less than a week with something we could call compliance. My point here is that I often get the feeling that ZTN vendors do the same thing. They looked over their existing product line, figured out what they could even remotely claim as being a part of a \u201cZero Trust\u201d solution, and overnight became a ZTN solutions provider. Of course, if your own organization\u2019s world view on what ZTN is lines up with a particular vendor, great! Buy it. But, for GitLab, we had to break down what we wanted the various components of our technology and data to do and align them with our own ideas of ZTN, refine our model, and then go find vendors that did extremely specific things. For example, we\u2019ve approached Okta with the breakdowns we are trying to solve \u2013 and they have products that solve them. For the most part we\u2019ve ignored the whole \u201cZTN packaged solutions\u201d approach and went after the core of what their products do, and we\u2019re solving our problems as a result. Conclusion We\u2019re getting there. We have a lot of wins, and a number of interesting challenges. Every once in a while we will post a new blog to keep you current on our security saga with Zero Trust, and hopefully you can learn from our examples \u2013 including our challenges \u2013 and help make your systems, data, and users as secure as possible. We hope you\u2019ll follow along and, if you\u2019ve got a ZTN viewpoint to share, we invite you to comment below, or, join our October 29 Zero Trust Reddit AMA over at \/r\/netsec.

{"text":"VU#598349: Automatic DNS registration and proxy autodiscovery allow spoofing of network services The Web Proxy Automatic Discovery(WPAD)protocol is used to automatically provide proxy configuration information to devices on a network. Clients issue a special DHCP request to obtain the information for the proxy configuration,but will fall back on a DNS request to one of several standardized URLs making use of the subdomain name of\u201cwpad\u201d if a DHCP response is unavailable. An attacker with local area network(LAN)access may be able to add a device with the name\u201cwpad\u201d to the network,which may produce a collision with a standardized WPAD DNS name. Many customer premise home\/office routers(including,but not limited to,Google Wifi and Ubiquiti UniFi)automatically register device names as DNS A records on the LAN,which may allow an attacker to utilize a specially named and configured device to act as a WPAD proxy configuration server. The attacker-served proxy configuration can result in the loss of confidentiality and integrity of any network activity by any device that utilizes WPAD.

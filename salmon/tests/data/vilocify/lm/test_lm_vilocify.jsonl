{"text":"FEDORA-2019-644b438f51 Upstream announcement:  Welcome to **phpMyAdmin 4.9.1**, a bugfix release.  This is a regularly-schedule bugfix release that also includes some security hardening measures.  We wish to point out that this also includes a routine fix for an issue that has been reported as CVE-2019-12922. The fix for this has been in our release queue to be part of this release, however it is the opinion of the team that the reported attack vector did not justify a separate release.  This release includes fixes for many bugs, including:  *    Editing columns with CURRENT_TIMESTAMP for MySQL versions 8.0.13 and newer *    Compatibility issues with PHP 8 *    Export of GIS visualization *    Enhanced descriptions for several collation types *    Creating a user with a single quote in the password string *    Unexpected quotes during import and export on text fields *    Improvements to adding new tables to Designer *    Fix an issue where an authenticated user could trigger heavy traffic between the database server and web server *    Fix a weakness where an attacker, under certain conditions, working at the same time as an administrator is using the setup script, could delete a server from the setup script  There are many, many more bug fixes thanks to the efforts of our developers, Google Summer of Code applicants, and other contributors.  The phpMyAdmin team"}

{"text":"MySQL Connector\/Node.js 8.0.20 has been released (no replies)   Dear MySQL users,  MySQL Connector\/Node.js is a new Node.js driver for use with the X DevAPI. This release, version 8.0.20, is a maintenance release of the MySQL Connector\/Node.js 8.0 series.  The X DevAPI enables application developers to write code that combines the strengths of the relational and document models using a modern, NoSQL-like syntax that does not assume previous experience writing traditional SQL.  MySQL Connector\/Node.js can be downloaded through npm (see   https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/@mysql\/xdevapi for details) or from   https:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/downloads\/connector\/nodejs\/.  To learn more about how to write applications using the X DevAPI, see   http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/x-devapi-userguide\/en\/. For more information about how the X DevAPI is implemented in MySQL Connector\/Node.js, and its usage, see   http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/dev\/connector-nodejs\/.  Please note that the X DevAPI requires at least MySQL Server version 8.0 or higher with the X Plugin enabled. For general documentation about how to get started using MySQL as a document store, see   http:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/8.0\/en\/document-store.html.   Changes in MySQL Connector\/Node.js 8.0.20 (2020-04-27, General Availability)  Functionality Added or Changed        * Added two new connection options that evaluate during the        TLS handshake to restrict the negotiated TLS protocols        and ciphers; along with those configured on the server        that can further restrict the final choices. These new        options are tls-versions to define the allowed TLS        protocol versions, and tls-ciphersuites for the allowed        cipher suites. These definitions are comma-separated, and        accepted by the getSession() and getClient() methods.        tls-versions: accepts one or more of the following:        TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, and TLSv1.3. Other values        generate an error.        tls-ciphersuites: accepts IANA cipher suite names, as        listed on IANA's TLS Cipher Suites https:\/\/www.iana.org\/assignments\/tls-parameters\/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-4        page. Unsupported or unknown values are ignored.        Example usage demonstrating both plain JavaScript and        JSON configuration object formats: # tls versions: mysqlx.getSession('mysqlx:\/\/root@localhost?tls-versions=[TLSv1,TLSv1.1 ,TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3]')  mysqlx.getSession({ user: 'root', tls: { versions: ['TLSv1', 'TLSv1.1' , 'TLSv1.2', 'TLSv1.3'] } })  # tls ciphersuites mysqlx.getSession('mysqlx:\/\/root@localhost?tls-ciphersuites=[DHE-RSA-A ES128-GCM-SHA256,DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256]')  mysqlx.getSession({ user: 'root', tls: { ciphersuites: ['DHE-RSA-AES12 8-GCM-SHA256', 'DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256'] } })        * For X DevAPI applications, when creating a new        connection, if the connection data contains several        target hosts that have no explicit priority assigned, the        behavior of the failover logic now is the same as if all        those target hosts have the same priority. That is, the        next candidate for making a connection is chosen randomly        from the remaining available hosts. If two hosts have the        same priority then one is chosen at random.

{"text":"openSUSE Security Update : singularity (openSUSE-2020-1011)        Nessus Plugin ID 138673 with Medium Severity Synopsis The remote openSUSE host is missing a security update. Description This update for singularity fixes the following issues :  - New version 3.6.0. This version introduces a new     signature format for SIF images, and changes to the     signing \/ verification code to address the following     security problems :  - CVE-2020-13845, boo#1174150 In Singularity 3.x versions     below 3.6.0, issues allow the ECL to be bypassed by a     malicious user.  - CVE-2020-13846, boo#1174148 In Singularity 3.5 the --all     \/ -a option to singularity verify returns success even     when some objects in a SIF container are not signed, or     cannot be verified.  - CVE-2020-13847, boo#1174152 In Singularity 3.x versions     below 3.6.0, Singularity's sign and verify commands do     not sign metadata found in the global header or data     object descriptors of a SIF file, allowing an attacker     to cause unexpected behavior. A signed container may     verify successfully, even when it has been modified in     ways that could be exploited to cause malicious     behavior.  - New features \/ functionalities  - A new '--legacy-insecure' flag to verify allows     verification of SIF signatures in the old, insecure     format.  - A new '-l \/ --logs' flag for instance list that shows     the paths to instance STDERR \/ STDOUT log files.  - The --json output of instance list now include paths to     STDERR \/ STDOUT log files.  - Singularity now supports the execution of minimal     Docker\/OCI containers that do not contain \/bin\/sh, e.g.    docker:\/\/hello-world.  - A new cache structure is used that is concurrency safe     on a filesystem that supports atomic rename. If you     downgrade to Singularity 3.5 or older after using 3.6     you will need to run singularity cache clean.  - A plugin system rework adds new hook points that will     allow the development of plugins that modify behavior of     the runtime. An image driver concept is introduced for     plugins to support new ways of handling image and     overlay mounts. Plugins built for <=3.5 are not     compatible with 3.6.  - The --bind flag can now bind directories from a SIF or     ext3 image into a container.  - The --fusemount feature to mount filesystems to a     container via FUSE drivers is now a supported feature     (previously an experimental hidden flag).  - This permits users to mount e.g. sshfs and cvmfs     filesystems to the container at runtime.  - A new -c\/--config flag allows an alternative     singularity.conf to be specified by the root user, or     all users in an unprivileged installation.  - A new --env flag allows container environment variables     to be set via the Singularity command line.  - A new --env-file flag allows container environment     variables to be set from a specified file.  - A new --days flag for cache clean allows removal of     items older than a specified number of days. Replaces     the --name flag which is not generally useful as the     cache entries are stored by hash, not a friendly name.  - Changed defaults \/ behaviours  - New signature format (see security fixes above).  - Fixed spacing of singularity instance list to be     dynamically changing based off of input lengths instead     of fixed number of spaces to account for long instance     names.  - Environment variables prefixed with SINGULARITYENV_     always take precedence over variables without     SINGULARITYENV_ prefix.  - The %post build section inherits environment variables     from the base image.  - %files from ... will now follow symlinks for sources     that are directly specified, or directly resolved from a     glob pattern. It will not follow symlinks found through     directory traversal. This mirrors Docker multi-stage     COPY behaviour.  - Restored the CWD mount behaviour of v2, implying that     CWD path is not recreated inside container and any     symlinks in the CWD path are not resolved anymore to     determine the destination path inside container.  - The %test build section is executed the same manner as     singularity test image.    --fusemount with the container: default directive will     foreground the FUSE process. Use container-daemon: for     previous behavior.  - Deprecate -a \/ --all option to sign\/verify as new     signature behavior makes this the default.  - For more information about upstream changes, please     check:    https:\/\/github.com\/hpcng\/singularity\/blob\/master\/CHANGEL     OG.md  - Removed --name flag for cache clean; replaced with    --days.
